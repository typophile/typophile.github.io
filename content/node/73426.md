  depends on the font, but setting aside unpredictable ornate initials, what are the
  accepted guidelines for, say, standard simple initials opening a book chapter or
  other long text document?  I'm primarily interested in the guidelines for relatively
  formal straightforward documents (books, business reports, etc.); obviously people
  can do lots of whimsical things in informal or more ornate situations.\r\n\r\nIn
  particular, I'm wondering about two issues:\r\n\r\n(1) Obviously the first line
  should generally be brought in closer to the initial.  But assuming the initial
  occupies three or more lines of text, when is it (if ever) a good idea to pull in
  the second and/or subsequent lines to follow the shape of the initial?  I've seen
  this done with A, V, and W to create a reasonable effect with the lines flowing
  along the diagonal.  But I've also seen lines pulled in with other letters that
  might produce excessive whitespace otherwise near the bottom (T, P, F) -- once even
  in a middle line next to an E, which looked quite strange to me.  Oh, and L is obviously
  its own problem with more than two lines.  On the other hand, I've often seen initials
  without such manipulations, which can sometimes leave a lot of whitespace, though
  they look a little more \"formal\" to my eye.\r\n\r\n(2) I know this is largely
  up to the eye of a designer and the specific font, but what are the general guidelines
  for aligning the left side of the initial?  I know that round letters (C, O, Q)
  look better pushed out slightly into the margin, and perhaps those that slant up
  on the left side (V, W, Y) or have an uneven left side (J, T).  With pointy serifs,
  it seems like it might even be a good idea to nudge out things like an I a bit.
  \ But how far is enough (or not enough), and how far is too much?  Are there general
  guidelines for such things?\r\n\r\nI don't expect that there's a magic equation
  or formula for these issues, which are highly dependent on the individual circumstances.
  \ But are there general opinions or rules that people follow beyond what I've already
  mentioned here?"

  body: "There are lots of opinions. One thing you can be sure of is whatever your
    opinion, someone else will have a different one. Even your \"obviously\" is banned
    by some.\r\n\r\nHere is one from column B. A drop cap is visually strong. The
    more lines it occupies, the stronger. If/when it threatens to overwhelm your chapter
    title, screen the drop cap back to restore some of the strength of the display
    type.\r\n\r\nFigure out how to deal with a drop cap preceded by quote marks. Strong
    opinions on that one, too. Or when the first word is in italic. If chapters start
    with a two-letter word -- such as \"At\" -- you have another problem. Or, you're
    using a three-line drop cap, but the first paragraph in a chapter is only one,
    two, or three lines long. And on & on.\r\n\r\nFrom column C: Some use small caps
    following a drop cap to really give a geometric shape. \r\n\r\nMy personal opinion
    is that as with most text design, the text itself will help you decide, and sometimes
    the best decision is not to use them."

  body: "Thanks, charles_e for the thoughts.  I do realize these are not easy questions
    and that there are a lot of opinions out there.  And, yes, I also do realize that
    there are further complexities beyond what I ask (other punctuation, short opening
    paragraphs, use of small caps, etc.).  I should have qualified my \"obviously\"
    as well; just as \"obviously\" there are bound to be other opinions on that matter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    to clarify my question -- I'm really wondering about letter shapes and the two
    particular issues I bring up: (1) when/how much to pull in text on the right,
    and (2) when/how much to push into the margin on the left.  I realize people may
    have varying opinions, but I assume most people will at least have some general
    guidelines that they personally think work well.\r\n\r\nWhile I too can come up
    with dozens of other parameters and dozens of other special situations, I'm trying
    to get a feel for the basics.  Beyond choosing a font, choosing the number of
    lines to drop, and deciding where to put the top of the initial, it seems like
    the two questions I bring up are the most common a designer has to deal with,
    no?  And these are highly dependent on the shape of the initial.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I'm asking a dumb question here, but I thought if one can come up with a set of
    rough principles to follow for the shapes of the various standard characters in
    roman type, similar principles can be extended to other more ornate shapes for
    initials.\r\n\r\nOr is a search for such rough principles bound to fail?  Is the
    answer always simply \"whatever looks good to your eye\"?"

  body: "Whatever looks good to your eye is where you'll start anyway, if the decision
    is yours. And over time, what looks good to you will likely evolve. In my world,
    several people <cite>may</cite> have an opinion: The editor, the designer, the
    typesetter, and the art director. Whose opining prevails will vary. More often
    than you might think, it is editorial.\r\n\r\nI remember one press -- I think
    it was Stanford University Press -- where they had a style sheet for drop caps.
    It covered all 26 letters, at least, implicitly -- a number of letterforms were
    grouped together. And the first \"regular\" letter of first line was closer to
    the drop cap only in a few cases -- A was one. As I remember, second & third lines
    pulled back with V and W, but not T. They had their reasons.\r\n\r\nDid I agree?
    No, but it was \"house style.\" Sometimes the comp is suppose to decide, but an
    the art director gets in a reactive mode. No opinion going in, but if they don't
    like something as set, they chime in at revises.\r\n\r\nNow if it is always your
    decision -- no editor, designer, or art director putting in a requirement --  you
    will perforce develop principles, as you call them. And over time, they will change.
    You will even be able to come up with arguments to justify each of them, even
    though the arguments conflict. Or, if you prefer, you can get these principles
    from authoritative books on design. As often as not, the authorities will not
    agree. \r\n\r\nI realize this doesn't directly answer your question. Maybe someone
    else will post.  "
