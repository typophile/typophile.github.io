    \r\n(not in swiss-french anyway)\r\nby saying that I've learned to add a tiny
    bit of space \r\nbetween the last letter and the punctuation."

  body: '[[http://unicode.org/udhr/n/notes_fra.html|This web page]] lists the rather
    specific spacing conventions used by the Government Printing Office of France.  Basically,
    punctuation marks that consist of two elements (: ; ? ! etc.) should be separated
    from the closest word to which they "belong" (for example, the last word of a
    sentence for a question mark, or the first word of a quotation for an opening
    guillemet) by a non-breaking space.  Whether that space should be full-width or
    thin depends on the punctuation mark.'

  body: "I thought, the distance of the punctuation marks to the previous word should
    be controlled by the plain metrics and the kerning, but not by any space character.
    The distance is often to small, because the left side bearing of the punctuation
    mark, stored in the font, is often to small. And I don\u2019t understand, why
    there should be a difference between punctuation marks, that consist of two or
    one element, except from the fact, that one element punctuation marks cannot collide
    with the arm of a T for example. A comma can also be to close to a letter. (A
    week ago I bought a book, in which I was irritated by the small left side bearing
    of the comma more than one time, because it simply was not visible enough.) If
    a punctuation mark is exactly between two terms, I am irritated. The distance
    to the following word should be clearly bigger (but in most cases it should not
    consist of two spaces). But note, that I am not a professional."

    I agree with you, it's weird, but, well, they eat snails ;-)\r\n\r\n<cite>...
    the distance of the punctuation marks to the previous word should be controlled

    two kinds of metrics for each font. Maybe we'll get this as an Opentype feature
    one day: mark a text as \"French\" and the question marks stand off.\r\n\r\nDuck&run\r\nAndreas\r\n"

  body: "The standard typographic conventions are more or less the same in France
    and Quebec, but the word processing conventions are different: as I understand
    it, in France, the convention is to type a normal space in each case; in Quebec,
    the convention is generally to leave out the space, except in conjunction with
    the colon.  For both locales, MS Word is configured by default to convert the
    appropriate spaces into (full-width) non-breaking spaces.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation
    that spaces be omitted in Quebec is set forth [[http://66.46.185.79/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?t1=1&id=2039|here]]
    by the Office qu\xE9b\xE9cois de la langue fran\xE7aise; a small note at the bottom
    makes it clear that the recommendation takes into account the shortcomings of
    common word processors (as of 2002), and that if you have a way to insert a thin
    space, you should use it before semicolons, exclamation points, and question marks.\r\n\r\nNone
    of the \"official\" lists of rules that I've seen seem to include percentage signs
    or currency signs (dollar, euro, pound), but looking through some French language
    materials it's clear that these are also offset by space (in both France and Quebec),
    and there are probably signs that fall into this category as well.  An ellipsis
    is not offset by space, however.  Apparently the rule of thumb (\"signe double,
    espace double\") has to be qualified a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any language
    other than French where extra space is conventionally inserted around punctuation."

  body: "From a French point of view:\r\n- punctuation signs with both a lower and
    an upper part which take a space before and after (hence the ellipsis does not);\r\n-
    the best practice is to have a non-breaking thin space before and one normal space
    after, although this may cause problems in justified texts (some word processors,
    some versions of XPress and Indesign shorten the normal spaces so much that they
    become smaller than the justified 'normal' breaking space);\r\n- whether there
    is a space between numbers on the one hand and monetary signs or percentage on
    the other hand seems to be left to the typesetter - however since these signs
    all stand for words, it would make sense to space them like a word (space before
    and after).\r\n\r\nAlso, look at 19C books in English (and many other languages),
    they are often spaces like French is nowadays. My understanding was that the practice
    of taking away that extra space was established by commercial publishers (notably
    of newspapers) who wanted to save space, thus money. I may be wrong!\r\n\r\nLast:
    the book quoted from the Imprimerie Nationale is very good, but as the title says,
    it is only the rules this printing press used internally and has no pretense of
    being the norm."
