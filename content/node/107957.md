  body: Everything about this screams "handlettered," but most especially the lowercase
    <strong>o</strong>. The counter of the <strong>o</strong> is straight up and down,
    but the outer contour of the <strong>o</strong> is listing heavily to starboard.
    Flanked by any other letters but this <strong>R</strong> and this <strong>y</strong>,
    that <strong>o</strong> would look ridiculous.
