body: "We had a new logo done for our organization. The designer decided to set our
  org's name in Caslon all-caps. Aesthetically, I don't like it, but I'm at the point
  where I'm just happy to have a logo that the comittee approved so we can start using
  it.\r\n\r\nThat said, aesthetic preferences aside, the face just isn't suited for
  use online. When reduced to a suitable size for our site's banner, the contrast
  between thins and thicks become distracting as the thin strokes begin to dissappear.\r\n\r\nI've
  suggested some alternatives (they seem to like Minion Small Caps) but the designer
  is insistent on Caslon. \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a Caslon-ish face that isn't
  quite as extreme on the thin strokes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you are only using it as a one time application like a name in a banner
    I would suggest having one of these type designers draw a web version of the name.
    Other than that set it in illustrator and add a very thin stroke to the letters.
    Not a good solution but its not like its a 300dpi enviroment.
