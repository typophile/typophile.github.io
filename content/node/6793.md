body: Someone&#39;s asked me for a specific IBM cut of News Gothic. Aparently it was
  used in Photosetting and possibly on daisy wheels. Does anyone know of any sources
  for this font? Possibly digital, although unlikely. <BR> <BR>Bruno Maag

    Maybe related, on page 18 of the Karel Martens <BR>Printed Matter book, there
    is a scan of IBM Selectric Composer <BR>Classified News. It looks very similar
    to News Gothic. Maybe <BR>they&#39;re related somehow.
