    Note that Bickham is an OpenType font with lots of alternate forms (it has 1700
    glyphs, altogether). You can access them in a savvy application, like InDesign,
    Illustrator and others.\r\nF"

    in it. Looks like the kerned the ibbo of Ribbon in real tight for some reason.
    That's not usually a good idea in connecting scripts.\r\n"
