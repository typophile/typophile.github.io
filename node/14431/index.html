  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a handwriting typeface with a bit of an edge to it. I&rsquo;m working on an identity project to appeal to urban youngish people in their late 20s and 30s. I&rsquo;d like to find a face that&rsquo;s casual and has some attitude, a little graffiti vibe in the style of the Mossimo logo (<a href="http://www.mossimo.com">www.mossimo.com</a>), but not a bonafide graffiti face &ndash; I need pretty good readability.
The closest thing I&rsquo;ve found so far is Marydale <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=3I00001201P2&amp;start=1">http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=3I00001201P2&amp;start=1</a></p>
<p>Which is okay but not quite as stylish as I&rsquo;m looking for.
It seems all the handwriting or casual script fonts seem too Hallmark greeting card/Yuppie woman &ldquo;pizzaz&rdquo; / Kraft salad dressing label&hellip;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

(If this is your approach, maybe you should refer to the iPod logotype.) Would it also be out of line for me to suggest you listen to the people you are targeting, and maybe collect some writing samples, so that you can see how they express themselves, then use your research as the basis for your approach?</p>
<p>If there is one thing I learned as a graphic designer it was that you have to be a member of the tribe to speak the language of the tribe; you can&rsquo;t be a tribal observer and expect to be trusted.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chester, you have obviously directed your comment at me, since all of the other replies contain only typeface names.</p>
<p>First, let me say that the &ldquo;Village&rdquo; is great (a comment which has nothing to do with this thread).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If there is one thing I learned as a graphic designer it was that you have to be a member of the tribe to speak the language of the tribe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think my descriptive terminology is strictly typographic: quill, grunge, crude marker, graffiti, and makes no attempts at approximating &ldquo;hip street graphic lingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you mean that to be &ldquo;a member of the tribe&rdquo; you have to live and work within the environs of other members, then I am one of the Grand Elders, having spent the a great number of years in the gritty streets of NYC and East Village with the very people that made it &ldquo;hip.&rdquo;  East Village was just a quite Ukranian neighborhood at one time.</p>
<p>NYC spray bomb graffiti styles emerged on the scene on subway cars during the 1960s, and on the west coast in LA around the same time. &ldquo;Rap&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gangstas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bloods&rdquo; have been around for over thirty years and have made the &ldquo;mainsteam&rdquo; vernacular that even Soccer Moms know &ldquo;waz up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you mean &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; to be a member of the younger up &amp; coming urban designers on the scene, then you are right, I&rsquo;m out in the pasture flinging cow chips.</p>
<p>You are not <em>out of line</em> for expressing that you feel my comments were condescending, but just say it plain, clear and directed to the individual(s). Because anything I can learn about being more helpful or understanding to posters who seek advice would be very helpful to me. I have no &ldquo;ego&rdquo; axe to grind and enjoy this community immensely.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m old, but I&rsquo;m back in style!</p>

<p>Chester&rsquo;s point is interesting: does one appeal to a target market by using writing that looks like their writing (which might entail research and possibly commissioning a font), or by showing them something more stylish and &ldquo;aspirational&rdquo;? Reality or stereotype?</p>
<p>One present technique (albeit DM tacky) is to use a rough script on a pseudo-PostIt note, to make it look like a buddy is passing on a recommendation. Is that anything like your creative strategy Troy? I mean, whose voice is the script representing in your ID?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks to everyone for your suggestions. They are really helpful. Dav, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of Rae Kaiser&rsquo;s fonts but I really love them. The Plz Script is the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen to what I&rsquo;m looking for, and it also looks cool with her (his?) &ldquo;Architectural&rdquo; font. The two could work well together for my project.</p>
<p>Chester, obviously research is an integral part of any successful design. However, my target audience/market is NOT graffiti artists or taggers. I&rsquo;m  looking for a face with an element of that kind of influence or flavor &ndash; but a &ldquo;real&rdquo; graffiti face would be all wrong for my purposes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you seem to be implying that we can&rsquo;t design for a group outside our own, which would be creatively confining, to say the least. Does that mean only designers with law degrees can design identities for law firms? Only gourmet cooks can design cookbooks? If I use a face like Cezanne am I &ldquo;talking down to&rdquo; my audience because I&rsquo;m not a 19th century French post-impresssionist painter (and neither are they)?</p>
<p>Also, you said that a typeface alone is not a design solution. Did anyone say it was?</p>

Are people who buy Mossimo stuff a &ldquo;tribe?&rdquo; They sell that stuff at Target.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Norbert, actually I was replying to the original post, and not to your font suggestions and other comments.</p>
<p>Please allow me to speak specifically: When I spoke of &ldquo;being a member of the tribe&rdquo; I was thinking about the time when I worked at a design firm and we were working for a mountain bike company. I embraced and enjoyed the life of a mountain biker, traded in my roadie attitude for a mountain biker attitude, hung out with fellow mountain bikers, and competed in races - which we preferred to call &ldquo;timed rides&rdquo;. I crashed, bled, and ate Clif Bars&hellip; I became a mountain biker. That was the only way that I could speak to my fellow mountain bikers through the work for the mountain bike company.</p>
<p>Design isn&rsquo;t simply applying a &ldquo;style&rdquo; to provided content; it is understanding a set of needs and desires and finding the way to communicate those needs and desires. Modernism isn&rsquo;t sans serif typefaces, it&rsquo;s philosophy. David Carson is a design philosopher; thousands of designers have copped his &ldquo;style&rdquo; but they have no idea about the philosophy behind his work.</p>
<p>To speak to the &ldquo;youth market segment&rdquo; requires much more than an edgy typeface.</p>

<p>No, you don&rsquo;t need to be a gourmet cook to design a cookbook, but if you are at least an amateur cook you should have insight to bring to your cookbook. You don&rsquo;t need to have a law degree, but you should talk to the lawyers at your law firm client and learn what they do during the course of their day. Unless you understand what they do it is very difficult to speak on their behalf.</p>

I carefully re-read your post and now realize you were offering advice in directed marketing design through depth of experience and understanding of the target group.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Voodoo Meisters of Marketing could care less about being aligned with any tribe except the &ldquo;RICH!&rdquo; Designers just offer treatments and direction on marketing campaigns, but all of the major campaign decisions are made by those who hold the purse strings.</p>
<p>What I am really trying to say is that top marketers are constantly sniffing for anything up &amp; coming. That&rsquo;s why some firms actually hire teenagers as consultants on buying trends. We designers are frequently just delegated to developing treatments. Though once in a while we (as designers) do really shine, and that makes it worth it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s an activity of those marginalized by the capitalist system, who can&rsquo;t afford to rent advertising space or buy a storefront to get their message seen.</p>

<p>No, while there have always been &ldquo;communal&rdquo; social/political movements, Communism per se was a specific political system and movement, deriving from Marx&rsquo;s 1848 Manifesto. It&rsquo;s the Hegelian element in Marx&rsquo;s theory that I was alluding to: capitalism being the thesis producing, through economic determinism, its antithesis, communism.</p>
<p>So, there are beer and smokes billboards plastered all over the poor side of town, that&rsquo;s the thesis, and a subway car covered in grafitti is its antithesis.</p>

I love Cezanne (the typeface AND the artist) but I think it&rsquo;s too formal and antiquated looking for what I&rsquo;m going for. 
The project is an identity for a line of all-natural soaps that are handmade in Brooklyn by a friend of mine. They look great, I think. 
Here is a link to a photo: <a href="http://serv1.uploadengine.com/1123705268D.jpg">http://serv1.uploadengine.com/1123705268D.jpg</a>
They smell terrific too. You almost want to eat them.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something that looks casual and contemporary and &ldquo;youth&rdquo; oriented, in this case middle to upper-middle income people who consider themselves fairly with it. We also wanted to avoid the romantic/precious references to historical styles (Laura Ashley, for example) that are so common in this category. Thirdly, we wanted something that would appeal to women AND men.</p>
<p>I was thinking the handwriting look would reinforce the handmade nature of the soaps &ndash; each one really is different.</p>

<p>Wildstyle graffiti is driven by the need for &lsquo;awareness&rsquo;, using inane and repetative &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; in the global public realm. But it&rsquo;s not profit making, so i guess it&rsquo;s more aligned with consumerism (like skateboarding is now). If 99.9% of graffiti did not look nearly so similar, I&rsquo;d think differently.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em> the principles behind communism are much older than Marx</em></p>
<p>Hrant, this statement is generally true, but Marx&rsquo;s Manifesto was developed, I believe, in response to specific economic trends which were emerging at the time he wrote it; specifically, it was a reaction to emergent industrialism.</p>
<p>Most people believe, because their history textbooks tell them so, that the American Civil War was waged to put an end to slavery. This tenet is utter nonsense: it was waged to see which manner of slavery would prevail &ndash; chattel slavery or wage slavery. American industrial output exceeded its agricultural output for the first time in 1850, which is when the debate began showing up on the American political stage (the Missouri Compromise). The basic point of contention:</p>
<ul><li>Factories required large labor pools from which to draw workers, and thus required large cities; and </li>
<li>Large cities were inimical to slavery, because they offered anonymous refuges for runaway slaves;</li></ul>
By this point in time, most European powers were no longer in the chattel slavery business, but wage slavery was a growing concern throughout the industrializing world. So, yes, Marx's specific brand of communism was indeed inspired by capitalism: it's just a shame that such a dysfunctional bunch of brigands as the Bolsheviks tried to pull it off...
