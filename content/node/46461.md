    MyFonts, but they seem to slap a pretty sum on top of the price."

    will give but from what i see he already gave to you.\r\n\r\nI think this is an
    awsome font. It fills the objective of making a book with just one typeface just
    using the different styles from the same font.\r\nIt's a beautiful font, the ligatures
    are just... no words.\r\n\r\nCongrats teacher! This is portuguese typography!\r\n\r\nJoel
