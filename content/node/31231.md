    along the lines of a "ct" loop or by extending the top stroke of the s straight
    into the arch of  the h.

      one of those!

  body: I would be interested to see what you make. So please post it here so we can
    see it. BTW there used to be a thing called a long s and it had a ligature with
    t as well. You might want to look at that. If you search typophile on google (
    site:typophile.com ligature ) you will find all kinds of stuff to help you. Maybe
    even an existing sh lig.

  body: I would lighten the weight of the top of the swoosh/join. The best ligatures
    of this type I have seen make the connection but do it in a light almost self
    effacing way. I might reduce the weight of the h's top serif as well because the
    weight of it is exagerated now that the connection is there. Or you could bring
    the arc into the h from higher up. There are many many ways of going from where
    you are but I think it's a fine start. I would try all this in pencil quickly
    rather than mucking about on screen. But I would try at least 4 or 5 different
    modifications.

    your own ligature the best so far. Because you've taken it from another pair of
    letters, you need to make the joins look smoother and more natural, if you will,
    to the letters you are using. I second Eben's comments, adding that the way the
    curve joins the s looks especially unnatural (to me, that is). "

  body: I don't think they are soooo bad. Just that they could be better. And I would
    look at both ends  notwithstanding the fact that one of the joins may have been
    'official'. I think both connections look sub-optimal. But it might be good to
    look at it in context. This is for a logo. Correct?

    and my line of thought is that the sh ligature is a good way to finish off the
    second syllable 'koosh' and draws attention to the pleasant sounding 'sh'.\r\n\r\nI've
    tried a few more options (below) (number 1 is the same as the previous post, allowing
    you to see how it's developed) which gradually seem to gain more of a higher,
    rounder loop, ending in number 5 where I've slightly altered the end of the 's'
    by curving that sharp corner (don't know if typographiclly speaking, that's an
    acceptable thing to do?)\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sh_options_4249.jpg]"

    sudden change of direction in the sharp 'corner' of the 's' into the loop was
    a little too much and so came up with #5 i.e a smoother 'corner' that flowed straight
    into the loop.\r\n\r\nThanks Linda!\r\n\r\nI'm currently sketching out an idea
    based on the feijoa 'sh' ligature mentioned earlier. I'll post it when I feel

    a little sharper but keep the smooth transition....  It might be nice to see it
    set as the logo as well to see how it flows with the other glyphs too.
