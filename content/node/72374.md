  body: "The 's kerning is fixed in the 1.4 release (among other things that people
    have reported).\r\n\r\nIndeed I put a lot of work on it, but since this was my
    first font, and it was a learning experience, I think that releasing it for free
    was a good deal.\r\n\r\nI get lots of feedback and learned a lot from that feedback.
    That is priceless.\r\nAnd, it get a lot of promotion and coverage, thats is priceless
    too.\r\n\r\nSo, enjoy the font!\r\nI enjoined a lot on the making and improving
    process, and meet a lot of people that was king enough for suggesting tips and
    ways to make it better.\r\n\r\nI will love to see what you ended up with.\r\nCan
    you post an image of the business card?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPablo\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oh, I assumed the kerning was the typesetter's problem, not Lobster's! I
    used it a couple times just to test it out and didn't see any kerning problems...\r\n\r\nGreat
    work though. :)\r\n\r\nAnd when I said \"s looks horrible\" I was referring to
    the kerning, not the glyph. I like the \"s\" haha"
