  body: I think it's calligraphy rather than a font. Repeated letters are not identical.

  body: "@ fvilanakis\r\nyou're right, there are similarities, but I don't think it's
    a match either - 'k' and 'p' are quite different, others really close.\r\n\r\n@
    Bendy\r\nthat repeated letters don't look identical is probably due to the bad
    scan. It's the box of a cd, small print - quite difficult to examine.\r\n\r\nIn
    an accompanying pdf-file the title of composer and opera is repeated in the same
    font as used for the title on the box (see image attached). Pdf-text tool identified
    it as Bellezza Heavy and Swash, but I can only find Bellezza Regular, which looks
    quite different. http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=786746\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the text on the box seems to be set in a different font anyway.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_4341.jpg]"

  body: Believe the pdf. Bellezza Heavy, where Condensed is used on the first sample,
    and Bellezza Swash, used on the second, were created by The Digital Quill Foundry.
    There are references in Luc Devroye's blog (http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32525.html)
    but could not easily find samples in the wild.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lamber_5599.jpg]

  body: Dick, may I bother you once again? Do you have an idea where I could purchase
    Digital Quill's Bellezza? I've searched in vain for the last couple of hours and
    no idea where to continue.
