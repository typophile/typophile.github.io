  of a designer familiar with romantic/vintage type styles. The projects are labels,
  branding and some product design including journals and stationery. I am in need
  of someone with an extensive knowlage of typeface options that go well beyond the
  norm. I am looking to incorporate into the projects a variety of vintage styled
  handwritting fonts as well as 30's and 40's Italian and French inspired signage
  and commercial style fonts. \r\n\r\nI am located in Walnut Creek, CA. Please feel
