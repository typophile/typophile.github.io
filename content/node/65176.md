  very first time and your feedback would be so much appreciated. THIS IS A FAVOR
  TO A FRIEND AND I ONLY HAD ONE DAY TO WORK ON IT. I had numerous versions, but this
  is the one that we came to agree to like the most.\r\n\r\nThis is the front of an
  invitation, but I have two versions in a pdf file put as a spread just so that you
  could compare the subtle differences (in placing of the information and typographic
  details). The theme of the exhibit is Dec14th of 2009 (it will feature the work
  of both the photographer as well as the fashion designer).\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!"
