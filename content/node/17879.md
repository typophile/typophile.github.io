    same. The horizontal strokes in A, E, F, H, Z, 3, 5, are too light for me.\r\n"

  body: "The A seems OK to me except the thin horizontal bar.\r\n\r\nThe distinction
    between U and V should be sufficient since it is a display face. I would put the
    round corner of the V to the right and the angular one to the left, however.\r\n\r\nThe
    lower right bulb/serif at the E could become a lot shorter as it is a situation
    different to the C. Ever thought of making the E based on the G with the bulb
    on top? The middle stroke should be longer. It is too short and your font is already
    witty enough so I wuold not try to add even more original details.\r\n\r\nI would
    remove the rounding where the two strokes of the T meet. Same for the central
    stem of the M, it does not match the principles of the typeface.\r\n\r\nThe middle
    stroke of the 3 should not be so additive, you should consider a solution like
    in the W.\r\n\r\nMaybe M and W are a bit too narrow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, well done
    so far!"

  body: "Hello,\r\nI have gone back and made more changes to my typeface.\r\nI smoothed
    out alot of the curves and I also thickened up a lot of\r\nthe horizontal bars.
    That definetly made it feel better on paper.\r\nI also added an alt version with
    no desending serifs. Also please\r\nexcuse the spacing on some of the letters.
    I forgot to\r\ndo that last night.\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROUND2.1.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROUND2.2.jpg]"
