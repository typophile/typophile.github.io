body: This was a logo my grandfather created for his machine shop back in the early
  1900's. This was the only scan I had from an old business card, and I was hoping
  to recreate it in vector format so I can use it in other, larger applications (i.e.
  T-shirts, etc). I'm mostly hoping to find out what the script font is, but if you
  know what the other two sans are that would be great also. Thanks.
