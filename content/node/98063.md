body: I've just released Barrowboy on myfonts.  It was inspired by the hand written
  sales tickets you see on fruit stalls, but I don't think I'll be selling many to
  market traders!  Any marketing suggestions?  Polite ones only please![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Barrowboy

  body: For some reason the other thing that jumped to mind when seeing this was playing
    cards. Perhaps you could mock some up?

  body: It's a very jazzy font, with the didone structure and the hornlike flaring
    of the verticals. Perhaps it would serve the interests of electro-swing musicians
    and other '20s-'30s retro pursuits.

  body: Like any other product it's helpful to know who your market is. If it's graphic
    designers, show mockup designs that show the type in it's intended usage.

  body: Yes, you're right Chris.  I've decided to go down the kiddy route (see attached).  Thanks
    HVB.  Any other suggestions gratefully received.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Barrowboy
