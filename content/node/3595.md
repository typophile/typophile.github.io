  curious if anyone knew what typeface is used for the blue and green street signage
  you see all over Paris is. You can see a photo of one here -&#62; <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.urban75.org/paris/paris007.html"

  Helvetica would probably do just fine, but I&#39;m curious nonetheless.

    most European contries are using this perhaps France got involved? '
