  problem I'm running into, primarily, is matching the slant/\"bulbous\" feel of the
  lettering with the paintbrush/san serif characteristics.  Wow...does it exist?  Please
  help.  Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nP.S. The lowercase \"g's\" are ultra rare to find
  in the same font family as all the uppercase letters."
