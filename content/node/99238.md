body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIt seems that, although there is a unicode for euro.smcp, or
  dollar.smcp, etc, there isn't one for rupee.smcp. Am I wrong? The rupee sign itself
  has a unicode, so it seems odd to exclude a smallcap rupee from the list. Is there
  any way of solvinf this, or are we simply to wait for a unicode upgrade?\r\n\r\nCheers,
  jasper"

    Where? Aside from private use, that is. Generally, small caps are not separate
    characters in Unicode (except for phonetics), and receive no Unicode index. That
    some give them a private use number is a private matter between consenting adults."

  body: "Charles is correct.\r\n\r\nAll these small cap glyphs are accessed as alternates,
    generally by means of small cap formatting, which in turn applies an appropriate
    layout feature. You need to be sure to hook them up to the 'smcp' feature. There
    is rarely any strong reason to encode them."
