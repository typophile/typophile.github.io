    <BR> <BR>I understand where you&#39;re going, but I don&#39;t think you need to
    take it that far. Just set a minimum level below which you start adjusting. I
    don&#39;t mind paying as much as the Americans.

    <BR>But I think Yves is right, it might be better to have a threshold. And maybe
    our Country Delegates can help out? <BR> <BR>&#62; what is the current demographic
    of ATypI? <BR> <BR>Well, &#34;We have members in over 40 nations&#34;, but from
    going to 3 conferences &#40;5 less than John, I think - although I&#39;ve been
    a member about a year longer than him :-&#41; it looks like maybe 90% are from
    Europe and North America. <BR> <BR>I think ATypI is very much international in
    spirit, it just has to find original ways of circumventing things admittedly beyond
    its control &#40;like economic inequality&#41; to become much more so on the ground.

  body: I agree with most of John Hudson say, as usual in fact, and others too. Its
    good also that this kind of discussion can happen inside ATypI, and outside ATypI.
    The main problem for us is that ATypI is somewhat democratic organisation, and
    its not because one board member or simple member have a good idea, suggestion
    -- that this idea, view, suggestion can be accepted by all the association and
    used. <BR> <BR>With the experience of how the association worked over the year,
    everything take time, and strong dedication. I will say that the association is
    clearly very open, not as AGI for example &#40;I hope to don&#39;t do mistake
    on this comparison in similar area?&#41; <BR> <BR>Just take as example that I
    am member from 10 years now, ok, far..., but 10 years ago, I know nobody at all
    on Type scene, and less than 4 years after, they trusted enough me to propose
    to organise an annual conference, pffuf, and  then I was elected to the board.
    What I mean, its like that for many people on the board and member these days.
    <BR> <BR>I truly remember Jason Smith &#40;<a href="http://www.fontsmith.com"
    target="_blank">www.fontsmith.com</a>&#41; in 1998, looklike another new young
    guy on the scene when I meet him in 1998. This year, he wanted to participate
    more, and he was elected on the board too. <BR> <BR>ATypI seems to work like United
    Nation in some way &#40;Maxime Zhukov surely know better than me UN&#41;, without
    the money &#40;I don&#39;t say that UN is rich as MS&#41;. More in a sens that
    anybody is accepted to some limit, the limit who let ATypI survive &#40;yes, its
    our main question behind all my comments these days&#41;. Any idea take long long
    time to be achieved. Example, the new website... <BR> <BR>This new website story
    started in Copenhagen &#40;2001&#41; after several years where website was discussed
    with not real effect. Some of us came to the idea to try to make it more open
    and democratic, less centralised. So, the website seems a good idea to give more
    power to the members, a tool who help people to share information, to post news
    and so on, as Typophile, typographi.ca who do it perfectly from a while now. Etc.
    So, rather than just an exchange of ideas during board meeting, at Copenhagen,
    then 1 year more for more discussion -- I proposed to set up a group of people
    to discuss with concrete proposal for it and comeback to the 2nd board at the
    end of Copenhagen conference. The idea was accepted, great, and the board decided
    that the new web site will became a major issue to which we need to spend some
    money. Ok, good. <BR> <BR>Months and months after, nothing really happened, all
    are in various places on the world, so... difficult -- but in last May, I offered
    my small place in Malakoff, for a board meeting in Paris &#40;ok, surbubs of it&#41;,
    and Mark Barrat came with some proposals, tools, plan to run it, etc. Then, the
    money became problematic at ATypI, at the same time, so the early idea to paid
    some people for this huge huge, work disappeared suddenly. :-&#40; <BR> <BR>But
    Mark Barrat was a a good guy, and he take over the complete job rather than to
    follow an outside guy paid by ATypI under his direction. No more money, ok, Mark
    Barrat done it himself. He was so great. Always positive. And now, we have a new
    tool, a great free tool done a dedicate member. <BR> <BR>What I try to explain
    is how ATypI work, as any associations, I pretty sure Sota, a great new local
    US association, have some difficulties too, but they are at who seems a more small
    level, and they bring news ideas, less cost, etc. They achieved something who
    is already an institution now I think. <BR> <BR>So, perhaps, in the future, ATypI
    membership will be tailored country by country, guy by guy? Who know? The guyd
    who want this solution, need to work harder to make it reality, came to ATypI,
    be board member, discuss, came with plans, reliable plans, that anybody need to
    accept because its seems very good, and then, the democracy will do it as he suggested
    couple of years, couple of months before. <BR> <BR>Any action, in association,
    particularly Worldwide one need time, dedication. You can

  body: 'Yves asks: <i>what is the current demographic of ATypI?</i> <BR> <BR>I have
    asked the ATypI secretariat to provide this information, since I want to run some
    numbers. I have a sampling of GNI per capita information for a number of countries
    in which I know ATypI has members &#40;see below&#41;, but would like to extend
    my analysis to an accurate picture of the association. <BR> <BR>GNI per capita
    is not a perfect unadjusted indicator for this purpose, but it is probably the
    best we have. There are, of course, obvious problems, especially when looking
    at countries with very large populations of mainly poor people &#40;e.g. India&#41;;
    anyone who is likely to be a member of ATypI is obviously making very much more
    money than most of the population, so the GNI per capita figure is too low an
    indicator. There&#39;s not much one can do about this; the indicator could be
    adjusted by the country&#39;s poverty rate, but too many nations do not publish
    statistics on the latter. <BR> <BR>I believe the greatest concentrations of ATypI
    members are in Western Europe and the USA, which is also where its activities
    have tradtitionally taken place. This is mainly due to the historical circumstances
    of the industry that originally gave birth to the association. Since that industry
    no longer exists, it is time for the association to find ways to extend its activities
    into other parts of the world. I believe that the membership needs to drive this;
    that is, we need to foster membership internationally <i>before</i> we can extend
    activity beyond Europe and North America. It would be great to see an ATypI conference
    take place in South America, or in Asia, but we need to develop the membership
    in these places first. Since there are people in countries like Argentina that
    desperately want to belong to the association, it would be foolish indeed for
    ATypI not to consider how this might be facilitated. <BR> <BR> <BR>Sampling of
    GNI per capita &#40;WB Atlas method&#41; for some countries in which ATypI has
    members or in which individuals have expressed interest in membership: <BR> <BR>Argentina

    professional association is often a legal requirement &#40;especially for doctors,

    not classify membership as a luxury. Being able to spend my money on truffles
    while my colleagues in other countries are struggling to feed their families is
    a luxury. Being able to financially support and take an active role in an association
    such as ATypI is something closer to a privilege, especially if one can, through
    that association, do anything at all to help one&#39;s less fortunate colleagues.'

    center, police/ gov. station ect. to be completed in the company of said reliable

    works to prove how valuable ATypI is as an organization. The goal of the Org should
    be to keep profits down to 0. Otherwise, ATypI isin&#39;t providing much of a
    resource is it? <BR> <BR>I.E. ATypI produces a typography dictionary. How valuable
    is that to a beginner = very$. How valuable is that to Hrant = $0. So they pay
    membership according to how valuable ATypI is to them and vice-versa. ATypI benefits
    and keeps its resources top-notch because it has top-notch participating members
    &#40;who wouldn&#39;t produce a typography dictionary&#41; again because it was
    cheap to get them because they are experts and ATypI recognizes that. If ATypI
    is making a profit its because they only have...umm... stupid members perpetuating
    stupid resources that they aren&#39;t studying very well. If ATypI works on a
    0 budget, its priceless. Perpetuating priceless information to stimulate priceless
    people. <BR> <BR>With a Board, also comes the Annual Report of which has that
    budget and revenue line. ATypI becomes accountable to its members. If they see
    profits are too high maybe they&#39;d cancel that membership <BR> <BR>In the end
    either way ATypI GETS Elitist and should aim to BE Elitist. Elitist isin&#39;t
    a bad thing. If they need extra cash for any reason then they should solicit the
    socialites, beginners and wotnot in order to re-fuel the bank AND its membership
