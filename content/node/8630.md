body: I am doing work for a nature/natural history travel company and am looking for
  a new typeface to use. I am looking for something organic, but not over the top.
  We usually have lots of body copy and our audience is older &#40;50&#43;&#41;. So
  far I&#39;ve been using Caslon at about 11-12 point. I love using it, because I
  can use it for headlines too, and with or without swash characters. However I am
  looking for something a little more organic. I like Tribute by Emigre because it
  has an antique look that could go well with the classic journeys and exploration
  theme, plus it has great italics.  Any suggestions? Thanks so much.

    of actual organic matter. I think they may be a bit too &#39;overgrown&#39; for

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I downladed the Chank fonts a while back and have
    been looking for somewhere to use them. They are a little much for what I need
    this time, but hopefully I can sneak them in sometime.

    I think it&#39;s lovely and organic feeling. It has some  very nice swash characters.
    Check out the <a href="http://www.presencetypo.com/pdf/Laricio.pdf">pdf</a> too.
