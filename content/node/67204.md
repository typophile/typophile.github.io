  for years and recently wanted to try install Linotype\u2019s FontExplorer X Pro.
  Any suggestions about font management software? Thanks!"

  body: "There are three major font management programs for OS X: Suitcase Fusion,
    FontExplorer X Pro, and FontAgent Pro. They are all serious and capable applications.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't say anything about what kind of work you do, what applications you use,
    or indeed anything else that would give us any clues that might suggest what features
    would matter to you. People have opinions in plenty, but it's hard to give meaningful
    advice in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'd be happy to see you give Suitcase Fusion
    2 a try, as I'm the product manager for Extensis' font management applications.
    What's the last version of Suitcase you used?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    at FontExplorer X, which was linotype's free font management tool before the release
    of the Pro version. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/27903\r\n\r\nIt's
    a great free app, and I find it easier to use that FontAgent Pro."
