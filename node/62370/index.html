  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well...this his been the talk of the graphic design community for the past couple of days.  http://bit.ly/KcNFe

I've heard <strong>many</strong> opinions from graphic designers, but I haven't heard many opinions from the type community.

I think there is a big gray area pertaining to the "font issue" in logo designs. <a href=http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=119471>Here's the iStockphoto statement</a href>.

Anyone have thoughts on the matter?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Seems like if you've licensed the font(s), there should not be license issues...
although I expect there will be different opinions on that question.

To some degree it does stretch the limits of 'single-user' licensing, to be sure.

Sure they are. Once you’ve entered a dozen logo design contests you don’t really have to design anything, you just keep tweaking and resubmitting permutations of the same old ideas. If you pirate all your fonts, software, and stock art the costs are even lower. And if you’re a working designer you can start by selling old comps or buy comps from other designers. And the same people who do these logos are also cranking out template-based web sites that pay much more than the logo contests. Sure this stuff doesn’t pay much, but it probably adds a nice chunk of income to small-town designers or designers living in the third world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was just thinking about the math and I realized just how great the logo-contest business is for a young designer. Spend thirty days making one design a day, each on based on an existing logo to save time, and choose a different business area for each design. Make sure each logo is carefully structured on named layers in Illustrator for easy re-use. In the next thirty days, make three distinguishable variations of each logo. Now you have ninety designs to recycle across the various logo contest sites. Now wake up every morning and submit five logo designs in fifteen minutes, and maybe win two or three design contests each week. In the meanwhile you’re sharpening your production skills and you’ve got an entire page of logo designs for the portfolio. Not such a bad way to go—especially in a tough job market!</div>

Are you kidding me? Just draw little stylized marks with no text! An illustrator could spend an hour a day cleaning up a few doodles from his sketchbook and have dozens of stock logos for sale to small business owners who will buy the mark, tack on their name in whatever free graphics software they have, save it as a tiny JPEG, and use it for years.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The biggest downside to this is twofold, in regards to type. At $5 per logo selected, you can't afford to license type. So your logos will:

A) Use software package fonts
B) Use pirated fonts

There's no way anyone's wasting time to draw custom type for these projects, so it'll be about what's trendy or overwhelmingly acceptable (Bank Gothic, Papyrus, and Trajan, here we come). And there's no way anyone's going to be able to police these, so I predict that the majority of logos using non-package fonts will be using pirated ones.

But in the end, it's about the clients. If they want cheap, they will get it. Let them. There will always be those willing to pay for quality and they will reap the benefits.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>At $5 per logo selected…</cite>

That’s $5 before the logo is actually sold. Once someone purchases the logo the designer gets royalties based on the price, which iPhoto claims will run 100 – 750 credits, so that’s somewhere around $80 – $700. 

<cite>There’s no way anyone’s wasting time to draw custom type for these projects…</cite>

I don’t think anyone is drawing custom type for at least ninety percent of the logos in use today. I could spend an hour walking around Manhattan and spot hundreds of wordmarks made together from unaltered type.

<cite>Except that’s not designing, that’s doodling.</cite>

And nobody designs logos by doodling up a bunch of shapes that are tangentially related to what the client does? Logo design doesn’t need to be lofty, it just needs to be technically competent. These are logos—not art.

<cite>You want random pretty stuff in your portfolio?</cite>

Any portfolio page of logos is going to look random to someone who doesn’t know the clients. As long as they look good it’s not going to matter—it’s not like a prospective employer is going to ask for a detailed explanation of a every concept when they’re hiring someone to do production work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, I understand your idea...but I think the permutations will look like essentially what they are: "sketches."

Any art or creative director worth their weight will be able to discern the difference between sketches and conceptualized logo marks.

There are many different ways and "hands" with which to build a logo. And the <strong>name</strong> and <strong>vision</strong> of the company is often what helps indicate that direction.

Production skills come from experience and working under actual deadlines IMHO. And for that they go to a staffing agency, where the agency has already vetted the applicant using production exam. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"Sure they are. Once you’ve entered a dozen logo design contests you don’t really have to design anything, you just keep tweaking and resubmitting permutations of the same old ideas. If you pirate all your fonts, software, and stock art the costs are even lower."

True, but even then, you really aren't making a profit based on the time spent.

Most of these types of logos aren't being submitted by graphic designers. They're mostly hobbyists/kids/etc. Nothing wrong with that, but you get what you pay for. And they earn what they're worth, I guess. 

Cheap logo systems seem to benefit one party: the party hosting the logo system and taking the cut. Rarely does a customer get something worth what they paid and rarely does the designer get paid what they are worth.

		<div class="commentbody">I think this will form a community of people (istock logo workers) with a much higher incidence of font piracy than any other people working in the field outside of istock volunteerism (by which I mean designers that don't contribute to istock). Contracts will likely place responsibility on the art worker/volunteer for font licensing and guarantees of originality.

The logos themselves are largely meaningless. For example, a client came to us for a dance company logo precisely because she did not want swooshy starfish-like cutouts of humanoid dancers, with perhaps a little star. If I search dance on the future iStock logo site, what do you think I'll find? Photography was similar -- stock is unacceptable. However, I had to put up a little free time. Still, these are the people you want to work for.

Back in the day, as they say, Joe, of Joe's Towing would walk into a print shop and order some business cards. The printer, being a good business man would try and up-sell Joe by offering a "logo". Joe would say, Uh... The printer, being sharp, would quickly haul out the 'big book' before Joe had the chance to say no, and open it to the Tow-truck section. There would be a couple dozen pictures that fit the theme "towing company". Joe would pick one and the printer would set "<b>JOE'S TOWING</b>" in Cooper Black next to it. 

90% of businesses just don't care - Never did and never will care about anything but the price when it comes to marketing themselves. They'd never see the point in shelling out for a font, and if they end up using one illegally, it's no loss really, because their alternative to stealing a font would not be paying for it.


Self medicating isn't new either :o)

Ah, that is because you are thinking about effective, professional logos. Istockphoto is thinking about selling commodities.

And it really won't be all that much difference to designers. There is already the "my nephew designed it" and "we'll run a contest for the grade 7 art class" customers. Those are more likely the ones that will buy from Istock. If nothing else, it might establish $100 as the floor price of a logo. (There are some customers who think that is too much).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I dont care about what the designers are going to design to sell there. I m worried about if they are going to use legal copies of the fonts to summit the first 10 thouthand logos and win 5$. I hope iStock introduces some protection over that issue but I doubt it will be possible to check so huge amount of designs. Maybe the best idea will be to introduce a point at the EULA to not allow the use on stock logos. Is that possible?</div>

Some design problems are pretty easy to solve. Larry the plumber just needs a logo with a pipe and a wrench that he can stick on his business card and his truck. He shouldn’t need to pay a designer $1000 for that, and may not have the money to. But Larry can solve that design problem in about ten minutes if he can find a little drawing of a pipe and a wrench with the word »PLUMBING« under it on iStock. 

Yes stock logos will result in some people getting a logo that looks terrible or out of place. But they’re not always going to be the wrong way to go. </div>

Yes they are, in terms of what a logo is supposed to be, what it's supposed to do, and when it's needed and when it isn't. If Larry the Plumber is going to get that sort of logo, maybe he doesn't <em>need</em> a logo. And that sort of logo doesn't do the job that a real logo does, anyway. It doesn't set him apart; it doesn't make him memorable; it doesn't emphasize his specific special strengths. It just says that he's a plumber. But to communicate <em>that</em>, he doesn't <em>need</em> to licence a "little drawing of a pipe and a wrench". Except maybe if his target audience is "people who don't know what a plumber is". :-\
It'd be better if he thought instead about what his invoices look like. Or that he mails out a special Season's Greetings card to his clients every year. Or even if he decides that when he visits clients who have kids, he brings a special popsicle for them, and the same one every time. That has more to do with what design and branding – in the broadest possible sense of these words – can do for him than an interchangable little clip-art logo.
Yes the world is full of perverse commodifications such as "stock logos". But that doesn't mean we all have to play. Or should, even.</div>
