  Talk\" event held at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts this Thursday (Jan. 12, 2012)
  at 6pm. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.artsmia.org/index.php?section_id=9&ev_id=4276|Here's
  a link to the MIA event page]] with more information.\r\nAnd [[http://chank.posterous.com/crosstalk-what-fonts-say-at-mia-on-january-12|here's
  the cool poster for the event]] designed by Anne Ulku. Tickets are available online,
  or at the event.\r\n\r\nChank will be talking about his own work and I will be quickly
  surveying the sources of inspiration for type design over the centuries. Then most
  of the time is devoted to an unscripted conversation and q-and-a about type following
  our presentations.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to it, and I hope to see a few of
  you there!"
