  I've always been fascinated by Anglo-American systems of measurement. I know roughly
  where the French term \"cic\xE9ro\" comes from but I'm wondering about the origin
  of the word \"pica\". Does anybody have a clue about this one ?"

    since the first printed book used clearly distinguished blacks and whites, like
    the plumage of the magpie bird."

  body: I found a dictionary entry that indicates that pica was a term in medieval
    Latin to describe a list of church services. Pica could have been a reference
    to the type used for those documents.

  body: "C\xE9leste, I am charmed by your question, since (if I'm right -- I'm citing
    this from memory and don't have time to look it up right now) the really logical
    system of measurement that we all use was largely developed by the Didot family,
    eh ouai c'\xE9tait bien une famille fran\xE7aise ! Ou plut\xF4t une dynastie.
    So although you may say cic\xE9ro and not pica, the supposedly Anglo-American
    system that you ask about is really built on work done in France. Or have I misunderstood
    your comments in the original question?  \r\n\r\nBruce"

  body: "Bruce, I know the point measurement system was perfected by the Didot family
    from the experimentations led by the Romain du Roi committee and then Pierre-Simon
    Fournier \"le Jeune\". I knew as well about the list of church services and the
    type size used to print it (\"cic\xE9ro\" comes from the same kind of \"semantic
    stunt\" \u2014 the works of Marcus Tullius Cicero, obviously \u2014 when a type
    size was given the name of the kind of printing work it was primarily or most
    usually used for). \r\nBut I never could be able to find what the original word
    \"pica\" meant exactly. Could there be a relationship between the Latin word for
    \"magpie\" and the heterogeneous nature (hymns, recitations, etc.) of a church
    service ? Or the fact that church services are very different according to the
    period of the liturgical year ? \r\nOr could the \"church pica\" bear no relationship
    at all with the \"magpie pica\", being the result of an abbreviation or an acronym
    ?"

    I wonder if the Ecclesiastical references (which also call this type of book of

    which makes more sense to me. Despite this fancy, many type size names are taken
    from church documents, brevier and primer are two more examples.\r\nTim"

    also means \"pious\" or \"devout\" in a religious context \u2014 is a very interesting
    lead ; this is the reason why I suggested that \"pica\" could have been an abbreviation.
    Which leaves us then with the problem to find out what \"-ca\" would stand for."

  body: "Ruari McLean (in <em>The Thames and Hudson Manual of Typography</em>) also
    mentions that pica (along with terms like nonpareil and brevier) used to be a
    type size. \r\n\r\nHere are some definitions from the <em>Glossary of Typesetting
    Terms</em> (Eckersley, Angstadt, Ellertson, Hendel, Pascal and Scott, University
    of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1994). No mention of word origins for pica,
    however.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pica:</strong> A standard typographic unit of measure
    equal to 12 Anglo-American points. Six picas equal 0.9936 inch, though personal
    computer systems round this off to an exact inch. This system of measurement is
    used primarily by typesetters, but also by many printers and binders. Historically
    pica was a type size, roughly equal to a 12-point setting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Point:</strong>
    The smallest whole unit in the Anglo-American measurement system used principally
    in typesetting and printing. The point is equal to 0.35136 millimeter or 0.0138
    inch, making 12 points to a pica and approximately 72 points to an inch (actually,
    72 points equals 0.9936 inch).\r\n\r\n<strong>Cicero:</strong> A unit of type
    measurement in the Didot point system, which originated in France and is now employed
    throughout Europe except in the United Kingdom and Ireland. One cicero equals
    12 Didot points, equivalent to 12.839 points in the Anglo-American point system.
    Ciceros are used in Europe to describe the width and depth of a block of text,
    serving much the same purpose as the Anglo-American pica.\r\n\r\n<strong>Didot
    point (d):</strong> A typographic measurement introduced in 1775 by the French
    printer Francois-Ambroise Didot and used in continental Europe. The Didot point
    equals 0.375 mm or 0.015 inch, larger than the Anglo-American point; for example,
    12 d is approximately the same as 14 points in the Anglo-American point system.\r\n\r\nAlso
    interesting: the point system was originally created by another French typefounder,
    Pierre Fournier le jeune, in 1737. He used 0.349 mm for his unit of measurement.
    \"Eventually a standard point of 0.013837 in. (0.3515 mm) was adopted by the American
    Type Founders' Association in 1886 and by the British in 1898...\" (Ruari McLean
    again)."
