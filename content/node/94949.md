  \ I just got a graphic artist job and the owner used this font for a product name
  that has since disappeared from every machine it was on.  This happened back in
  2010.  The files I have indicate that the name of the font was Tangerine.  I have
  been able to find fonts with that name but they are not matches.  So here is a rundown
  of what I know.\r\n\r\n1.  Script/Handwriting Font\r\n2.  Bubble Letter / Marker
  look\r\n3.  Disappeared from Apple computers in Dec 2010\r\n4.  Used to be called
  Tangerine.\r\n5.  Cannot find it anywhere on the internet under the name Tangerine.\r\n\r\nThe
  picture I am uploading are the only characters I have that I can show.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nDan / Globalpuffer"

  body: "The font was originally distributed with an early e-magazine, \"Bright Ideas\",
    which is long gone. The original distribution had no licensing information.  \"Tangerine\"
    doesn't appear to be a copy or clone of anything else, although there are a few
    other fonts that are vaguely similar.\r\n\r\nThe font doesn't contain any internal
    information regarding its source, and it doesn't appear to be currently available
    on-line.\r\n\r\nI can't figure out how to send an attachment through here; attached
    is an image of the character set.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TangerineByBrightIdeas_5475.jpg]\r\n\r\n

    body: Hi Herb, would it be possible for you to send me a copy of the font file?  If
      you have it?  I would be eternally in your debt.  Don't know how I would repay
      you but maybe I could mail you out a lotion stick or something?  :)  Let me
      know.  My email is dan.budke@yahoo.com.

    surprised if it's <em>not</em> an illegal clone of a commercial font. So I personally

  body: "<blockquote>Do people do that?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't know what specific
    activity you're referring to, but the answer is: yes.  :-)\r\n\r\nJudging by the
    poor quality of the outlines I suspect this was a scan-and-trace job. Which means
    if you need <em>exactly</em> the same letterforms, you're going to have to: find
    the actual font; come to terms with using a font of unethical provenance (assuming
    my hunch is right). If you can settle for something very close, I'm sure you can
    find it; and although it will put you out-of-pocket (probably by a small amount
    though) you're very likely to end up with something of better quality (and guilt-free).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: The reason the outlines look bad is that the psd file this comes from is
      old.  I am pretty sure the font was legitimately installed on a machine that
      no longer has it when it was first used and the file was created.  I was able
      to rasterize the text and then I had to move it around so it wouldn't be crooked
      when I posted the image here, but because I don't know what it is I cannot do
      any more than that.  I am stuck with what was already made.  It's too bad that
      people steal the fonts.  I cannot imagine the amount of work that goes into
      producing one.

    find out that what you have is \"stolen goods\", then you have to ask yourself
    what to do about it. Mind you, I can't be sure that's the case here.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    here's a couple of possible substitutes:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/arab-brushstroke/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/cedar-key/\r\n\r\nAlso
    check:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit\r\n\r\nAnd yes, good
    fonts take a long time to make. And a fraction of a second to pirate. In terms
    of effort/byte I don't think any other kind of \"media\" comes even remotely close.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: '@hrant.  Thank you for those substitutes!  Those are awesome fonts.  The
      house-script at the sign painter site in particular quite close to mine and
      may be a viable alternative.   If you look around the net, conversations about
      using Bright Ideas fonts seem to all run in similar veins to the one we have
      had here.  Unfortunately, this company never made things very clear and I see
      the argument that using them might be a bad idea.  You are right to suggest
      caution.  I appreciate the time you took to share your experience and to find
      me some alternates.  :)'

  body: "@Hrant - I exercised due diligence in trying, and failing, to find an existing
    commercial or free font that matched Tangerine. Most of Bright Ideas' fonts were
    original, but they also had a few re-created implementations of old metal or photo
    foundry fonts, including such as Ashley, which pre-dated both akaPotsley and Spiece
    Graphic's Edison Swirl . The same company sold commercial fonts by subscription
    under the Software of the Month Club label.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
