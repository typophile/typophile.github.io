    and re-asked [[http://www.typophile.com/node/106900|here]] and still unsolved.
    So I'm afraid and even if your request is URGENT that might probably be a custom
    lettering for the brand. I suggested [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/yana|Yana]]
    as alternative but far from being even loosely similar. \r\nFunny also because
    the more I look at it the more /P looks completely off-topic, some kind of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/figgins-tuscan|Figgins
    Tuscan]].\r\nCloser look and more letters [[http://myfonts-wtf.s3.amazonaws.com/1b/1b9e5bb6d759a60b10456e812065ef29.67578.png|here]].\r\nVector

  body: "Agree wholeheartedly with Ryuk\u2014this is a custom wordmark.\r\n\r\nAs
    a base for recreating all but the cap initials, try Austin, by Commercial Type
    (will require editing):\r\nhttps://commercialtype.com/typefaces/austin\r\n\r\nFor
    the initial caps (and that |O|), these faces from Letterhead Fonts may be a decent
    starting point for editing:\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/confection.php\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/englishrose.php\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "Austin is an interesting suggestion, with a good match for the serifs.\r\nNote
    that the \"Austin Text\" version seems to have a contrast that more closely matches
    the wordmark than Austin does. Also, Austin Text Roman seems a closer weight than
    Austin Text Semibold.\r\nDon"
