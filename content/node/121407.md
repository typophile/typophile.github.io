  body: "Edited:\r\nThe De Vinne design is a revival of Elzevir, originally designed
    in the late 18th century, by Gustav Schroeder's in 1893 for Central Type Foundry.
    It is a very bold display version of Elzevir Bold and became the most popular
    typeface of the 1890s. Central (and then ATF) added many styles to the family.
    By the early 20th century almost every foundry had versions of Gustav Schroeder's
    design.\r\nConsider a Ruthenian (Ukrainian) DeVinne by Monotype in 1916\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ruthenian(Ukrainian)DeVinneByMonotype1916_4122.gif]\r\nDeVinne
    went from the height of fashionable font taste before WWI, with many weights and
    variations, to unspeakably quaint in the Art Deco era. It disappeared from ATF
    catalogs after 1923. It has never returned to fashion.\r\nThe 1928 Olympic numbers
    are a last gasp of a fading style.\r\nThe name DeVinne is now used for another
    typeface design. With the exception of the Wooden Type version, revivals are sold
    under other names.\r\nThere have been occasional attempts to modernize the DeVinne
    design, such as http://www.fontseek.info/gza\r\nGza's numbers look generic compared
    to the DeVinne original. Here they are: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GzaNumbers_6114.jpg]\r\nDon\r\n"
