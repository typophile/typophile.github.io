body: "For those interested in 19th century wood type and decorative typefaces, a
  reissue is now available of Rob Roy Kelly's classic book: American Wood Type 1828-1900.
  The book has been out of print for about 30 years, but it is still considered the
  definitive work on American wood type. The reissue includes a new foreword by David
  Shields, Design Curator of the Rob Roy Kelly Wood Type Collection at the University
  of Texas at Austin, discussing the renewed interest in the subject since the mid-1990s
  as well as ongoing research into the history of wood type. In addition, the reissue
  includes the essay \u201CSearch and Research\u201D by Rob Roy Kelly about the many
  years he spent pursuing wood type fonts, researching their origins, and writing
  and producing his book.\r\n\r\nAside from these additions, the book is a digital
  facsimile of the original edition, and is available as a print-on-demand edition
  from Amazon and other online booksellers at a price of $35.00:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0978588177]]\r\n\r\nIt
  is also available directly from the publisher at a discounted price of $29.95 through
  June 30:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.liberapertus.com/store/american-wood-type]]\r\n\r\nNote:
  the edition available on Amazon is slightly smaller, 8.25 x 11.7\" (A4 size, 50#
  paper) vs. 9 x 12\" (same trim size as original, 70# paper) for the edition available
  from the publisher, due to limitations from the print-on-demand vendor that supplies
  the book trade. \r\n\r\nThe book will also be available shortly by print on demand
  in the UK, which will avoid the exhorbitant international shipping costs due to
  the size and weight of the book.\r\n\r\nThe book has been reissued with the approval
  and assistance of the author's widow. Please email me with any questions about the
  book.\r\n\r\nMatt Kelsey\r\nLiber Apertus Press\r\nmatt@liberapertus.com"
