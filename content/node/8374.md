    too, but it&#39;s a relatively different typeface...

  body: Ouch... yeah, I liked this font and was looking forward to downloading it
    until I took about 10 minutes to explore the site and came up with nothing...
    just because you can make a website look good, it means nothing if you can&#39;t
    navigate it!

    functional.

    I don&#39;t find either to be pleasing or user friendly in the least.

  body: Patricia, <BR> <BR>I agree 100%!  That site is a nightmare to navigate, and
    it took forever to click on all the font links with those floppies being redrawn
    ad nauseum.  It&#39;s pretty nice looking site though, but that&#39;s besides
    the point.

  body: It is beside the point if it makes you want to throw your computer out the
    window. Designs can be nice looking, cutting-edge, AND functional at the same
    time.  <BR> <BR>I blame David Carson.

  body: Hear hear!  I have to admit that I do like some of Carson&#39;s work... I
    like the organic qualities.  But like you said, you have to be able to read/navigate,
    if you don&#39;t have that you might as well look at a painting.

  body: Some of Carson&#39;s work is brilliant, and I gotta give him credit for breaking
    new ground. But he has so many lousy imitators out there who think type is merely
    another design element, rather than something you might want to read. Then throw
    in the web wizard who wants to show off his Flash skills with no regard to the
    user, and you have a complete muddle like that site. <BR> <BR>But that&#39;s just
    my opinion. Call me a stick in the mud.

    link to bypass the flash. That first site froze my computer. Now thats lousy design.
