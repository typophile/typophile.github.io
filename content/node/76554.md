  specialing in limited edition screenprinted goods of the creepy, quirky, cartoon
  variety.\r\n\r\nI liked using only one colour as these will eventually be printed
  onto calico tote bags that the t-shirts come in. Due to the texture of the bags
  it should give for some nice natural variations in treatmeant.\r\n\r\nAll feed back
  is welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ns_3611.jpg]"

  body: IMO the drips are not necessary, the shape and text are strong enough :) I
    would also drop the period and space words a bit further apart.

  body: I like it, and I think the drips are necessary. Maybe if you make the swashes
    inside the turd a little darker or a different colour it would get a little bit
    more dimension. You should also make sure it's legible at smaller sizes.

  body: yes the drips were put there originally to give it a more "nasty" gross feel

  body: I say use the very first design, but change the colouring like you did in
    the top-right version. Remove the stink lines. Because you don't have to deal
    with the thick outline of the turd you can make the lettering larger. good luck!

  body: "Interesting evolution. I wanted to say that the initial shape you'd enclosed
    it in was reminding me more of an ice cream icon or shaving cream than what I
    realized later was supposed to be a pile of crap.  I think.  \r\n\r\nThe type
    is getting more legible. I would question the perspective of the letters and the
    shape they're creating.  It appears to be falling over. Odor lines are a good
    idea, but the same device also indicates a sweet smelling pie.  Go look at Peanuts.
    How many ways did Charles Schultz make pigpen look dirty with simple lines?"

  body: the bottom one is getting close. I think you can make the lettering even larger.
    Don't be afraid to let it go outside the turd a little bit.

  body: "In your last version here, I find the first one (type + trailing odors) to
    be quite iconic. The linework of the odors is still off in some way; a little
    too squat for one, and second, it would look better with one or two well done
    lines than a jumble of 3 or more that aren't done well.\r\n\r\nI would try refining
    getting rid of the middle and right lines, and refine your work on the first one
    on the left--make larger, smooth the curves, and then play with its location above
    the letters."

    here. It's too \"busy\" and doesn't communicate quite the right thing, or at least
    not clearly enough. After all, gooey is not the same as stinky.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I completely agree with Thomas. And I would stay with those three odor lines,
    perhaps only a little refined; as they are now they add a sense of nastiness to
    the smell..

  body: "The smell lines might look nastier if they were more angular.\r\n\r\nThe
    text is now leaning from left to right. It might work better if the top row of
    text (Nasty) which gets smaller from N to Y was offset by Smell getting bigger
    from S to L. That would result in the text leaning less."
