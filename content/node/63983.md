  be quiet difficult. Well, it has definitely been the case with me for a long time.
  I reckon I have had a 1000 different attempts at coming up with something 'clever'
  and eventually just give up for a few months before giving it another crack.\r\n\r\nThough,
  I am starting to settle my thoughts into having something...let's saying..'not so
  crazy'.\r\n\r\nWell, here it is below. Just a play on my initals. I quiet like this
  idea and where it is going...but I don't know. Throwing my hands up.\r\n\r\nOpen
  to all thoughts. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMattBurns\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B_Logo_3817.gif]"

    it on its side, as you have it at the moment, so it looks like a capital B without
    the vertical stroke.\r\n\r\nMake sense?"

    logo and it's super frustrating. I just stuck to a recent idea and did it because
    I realized I'm not Nike or Apple so it's not reeallly going to matter. I can change
    it a year from now and probably no one will realize.\r\n\r\nI believe this is
    what peter is talking about. I think this could very well work with some adjustments.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mb_6198.jpg]"

    you're absolutely right.\r\nAnd while inserting meaningless body parts is a common
    (and successful ;-) practice in marketing and communication, I agree this unrelated
    3 probably overcomes any immediate reference to either m or B."

  body: yeah, i like just the nov 9 version. but i would just leave it like the sideways
    m from the original logo, just grey, not a white outline. outline weakens it if
    you ask me, make it a solid object. i think it's fine straight up not tilted.
    if people think it's a 3, then tell them you have 3 testicles or something. then
    it's 3 concepts in one. maybe im kidding about that. maybe not.

    \ I am looking to set up a litte online home for the various amounts of stuff
    I have put together on a hobbie basis. It is kind of geometric, illusionistic
    type based. I think this logo would be an appropirate face.\r\n\r\nAs you can
    tell by the little display pic, I have decided to stick with the last design posted.\r\n\r\nGood
    team effort guys. Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nI have taken every suggestion with full
