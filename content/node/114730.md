  thoughts on it?"

  body: "It's a good implementation of RSVP, and it has the efficiency benefit of
    RSVP and it also has the usual drawbacks: you can't vary the pace of reading as
    you naturally do in normal text, you can't perform regressions to correct misreadings,
    which is a normal part of reading, and if your attention wanders for even a second
    you'll miss whole swathes of content and meaning. And so far there is no evidence
    that the speed gains of this form of RSVP perform better in comprehension and
    recall tests than any other kind of 'speed reading'.\r\n\r\nWhat has been demonstrated
    though, is that companies are good at writing press releases and journalists are
    happy to have stories mostly written for them. But we already knew that."

    Address. Can''t change pace, can''t regress and missing content are non-issues,
    little or no parafoveal space exists, and "optimal reading" is not the goal, on
    mobile and wearable devices. '

    more my line of thinking here."

  body: "If there is purpose in assuming some imaginary optima, if there was only
    more room for parafoveal activity, you'd have to more than tweet it. This is not
    a new composition technique, we deal with foveal word recognition activities perfectly
    optimally, at high speeds (on the road), in the dark (at the movies), and in most
    \"reading\" studies (you know that). And foveal word recognition goes all the
    way back to face recognition. \r\n\r\n\"How would you design a typeface differently
    if you knew that this was the intended application?\"\r\n\r\nI would tend to follow
    design choices that react to the particular environment of the presentation and
    not the composition technique. The \"reader\" is expecting familiar. I think there
    are additional design/selection issues depending on mobility vs wearability. \r\n\r\n\"...the
    algorithm that they are using to deduce the Optimal Recognition Position \"\r\n\r\nI'd
    assume this is their secret, but i'd take all the words that have been studied
    for this feature, and extrapolate, by syllable or something, to the rest of the
    dictionary (and god help the Germans when spritzkrieg arrives)."

    more than half of the reading data. The only reason this has yet to be empirically
    proven is that field testing methods have been inadequate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
