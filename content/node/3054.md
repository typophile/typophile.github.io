  body: Bingo... yes, it&#39;s FF Info Display <BR>Thanks a lot. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    also a FF Text but it&#39;s not as clean &#40;&#34;g&#34; for instance&#41;. I&#39;m
    thinking of using FF Info Display for some short paragraph descriptions. Any similar
    fonts I should know about? <BR>Thanks.

  body: It&#39;s not always like that. If it times out, check the original thread
    first. Usually the post went through. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t really follow the Meta/Info/DIN/etc.
    bunch very closely. FontShop seems to have a lot of them, though.
