  as far as I can tell, produce the same result: Hinting and Links.\r\n\r\nFontLab
  of course has no help menu and no explanation one way or the other. Hinting, of
  course, helps the letterforms appear crisp on screen, but what does Linking do that
  is better or worse?\r\n\r\nAny clarification would be helpful."

  body: "[This thread probably belongs in the Build forum]\r\n\r\nWhen you generate
    a font, links are interpreted as hints and exported as such. The difference between
    them in terms of editing is that a hint is a distance in the cartesian space,
    while a link is a distance between two specific nodes. I tend to go back and forth
    between links and hints depending what kind of tasks I am performing (and I have
    set up keyboard shortcuts to switch back and forth quickly). Links are most useful
    if you want to move outline nodes while maintaining the relationship of hints
    to those modes. Links were added to FontLab at the same time as Multiple Master
    interpolation, and they allow you to easily maintain the same link -- and hence
    hint -- structure between different masters.\r\n\r\nSo why not just use links
    all the time and never hints? There are circumstances in which one might want
    a hint to not connect directly with outline points. If one is manually hinting
    a PS font, one can affect rendering by shifting the hint off the outline, which
    one cannot do in link mode.\r\n\r\n"
