  body: "omashuisje, thanks for your reply. I think the font you posted is very close
    to the logo I was looking at. I wonder if they adjusted the vertical scale. While
    it's very close the \"a\" differs a bit, but the rest of the letters look pretty
    close. Thanks for your help, I'm going to see if I can test it out and keep looking
    on the meantime. \r\n\r\nI also tried What the Font to ID the font, but no luck,
    it picks up on too many other typefaces that differ vastly. Thanks again. "
