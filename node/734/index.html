		<div class="commentbody"> Ok, I&#39;ll play nice. <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t live in vacuums - other people get influenced by the same things we get influenced by and come up with their own solutions too. <BR> <BR>One of the basics of copyright, as opposed to some other forms of IP protection, is that it allows for people to independently come up with the same solution. It doesn&#39;t mean that anyone copied anyone else but that the number of solutions is finite: <BR> <BR>&#34;Great minds think alike - small ones seldom differ&#34; <BR> <BR>To be really brutally honest all three designs are just standard corporate print look - if you think otherwise you&#39;ve been hiding under a rock for the last ten years. <BR> <BR>Some years ago I did a magazine redesign, a couple of months later a magazine in the same sector did a redesign too - they used the same typeface and similar styling to mine. Did they copy me or were both teams so caught up in the spirit of the moment that they didn&#39;t recognise the generic response that they&#39;d offered their clients? <BR> <BR>If you really want to waste your time and get really excited about this you&#39;ll spend the next coupla months trawling the web to see how many other &#34;clones&#34; you can find. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> People coming up with the same idea independently  <BR>is one thing... a pixel for pixel copy is quite  <BR>another. <BR> <BR>The guy from Oxona admitted to copying the  <BR>design. He even had the gall to give me &#34;kudos&#34;  <BR>for a cool design. He wanted to make it clear  <BR>that he did not copy the code... just the design. <BR> <BR>If the &#39;nuclearcow&#39; site was &#34;inspired by&#34; 3Com  <BR>it&#39;d be a somewhat different story. This is  <BR>clearly ripped off. Do some math: the nav, the  <BR>photo, the headline, the subhead, the body copy,  <BR>even the footer and copyright notice are in the  <BR>same position. That icon on the right... I  <BR>designed it, pixel for pixel. <BR> <BR>More hilarity: their jobs section says they&#39;re  <BR>looking for innovative people. Amazing. <BR> <BR>The lesson here is: if you want to protect a  <BR>design you better have it copyrighted... and not  <BR>just logos and trademarks.

Having it registered at the copyright office is going to do what? Perhaps give you a little leverage before you go to court. If you end up in court they&#39;re going to pull out 3 dozen different sites that contain all or some of these elements. <BR> <BR>What are you going to do then - pay the lawyer and go home with a long face. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sympathetic to trying to protect your work, but a bit of layout that is not innovative coupled with some navigation that definitely is not innovative isn&#39;t going to get you very far. <BR> <BR>Sorry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> C&#39;mon Joe, you wouldn&#39;t keep bringing it up if you weren&#39;t at least a little bit proud of having your work copied. I haven&#39;t had any really good copies of my work since a kid named justin copied my skiing penguin in the third grade. &#40;but boy did it make me mad&#41;. Realistically, though, a site like 3com is an obvious target. There will always be a few people making a lot less money in some mom and pop shop copying the big boys. It doesn&#39;t stop there, though. Look at the most recent spat between Macromedia and Adobe. I guess there is a fine line between cross polination and straight cloning. These guys obviously crossed it. </div>
