  body: "From Monotype:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The original design of Egiziano Black is
    attributed to Vincent Figgins in 1815. As its name suggests, Egiziano Black is
    a typical example of an Egyptian, or slab serif typeface. Use the Egiziano Black
    font for posters and titling.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFont Bureau's <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Giza\">Giza</a>
    is based on a similar source:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The sixteen styles of Giza bring
    back the colorful power and variety of the original Egyptian letterforms, a glory
    of the Victorian era. Designer David Berlow based the family on showings in Vincent
    Figgins' specimen of 1845, the triumphant introduction of this thunderous style.
    The truly unforgettable \"Nine\" weights were designed for ultimate emphasis in
    posters, and do their most effective work in the very largest of sizes; FB 1994</blockquote>\r\n"
