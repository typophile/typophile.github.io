  body: "Did not find a match in a single font. Closest I was able to get was <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament/std-bold/glyphs.html\">Atrament
    Bold glyphs</a> which has generally matching WIAR, with the round-top A as an
    alt. Also <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament/\">Atrament
    font design info</a>.\r\nAtrament does not have an N with a diagonal that intersects
    the right stem above the baseline. I found a font with this N although at a higher
    point than your image, together with a round-top A: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/rockport-bf/\">Rockport
    BF</a>. \r\nDon"
