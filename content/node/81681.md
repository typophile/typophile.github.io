body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with the kerning of ITC Bodoni 12. The fonts seem
  to be OK when I view them in fontexplorer, with kerning properly applied. However
  when I use them in Adobe CS2 the kerning does not work and the values are all zero.
  I viewed it in Fontlab, where there are kerning pairs defined using the kern feature.
  I compared with some other fonts and the only difference I could find in coding
  was the line mentioned below:\r\n\r\nfeature kern { # Kerning\r\n script     ;"

    for the stretched post, but the posting system seems to run haywire with the coding.

  body: I found suggestions in other threads that the lack of other OT features may
    be a problem. Bodoni 12 only has the 'kern' feature. I tried adding another feature
    in fontlab but this did not work somehow, but as I'm not really experienced with
    fontlab and might be doing something wrong.

  body: I'd contact the foundry or distributor. If there's really a bug, it's up to
    them to correct it.

  body: I have indeed contacted the foundry, so I will wait for their response. I
    have found another typeface, Gill Sans Schoolbook OT TTF, which does not show
    kerning in CS2 (this time not in fontexplorer as well) but does show them in fontlab.
    It also only has the kern function. If this is the bug, then perhaps someone can
    show me how to resolve this on my own in other cases?

  body: Janek, thanks for the link. I tried it, but it still does not work the way
    it should.
