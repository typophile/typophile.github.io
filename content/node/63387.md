    have checked out Ren\xE9 Knip's site and I do not see anything like ours in his
    current offereing.  But geographically it is not far away (we are in the country
    in Flanders, Belgium).\r\nOther ideas still welcome - it's a great site,\r\nTopaz"

  body: "If you removed the serifs from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-korinna/|ITC
    Korinna]] you get something fairly similar. The arched A is familiar, but not
    from Korinna, unfortunately. \r\n\r\nThe style seems Art Nouveau-like, but cleaner
    and simpler. Really very nice and elegant.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
