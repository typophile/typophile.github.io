body: "I was wondering if anyone has experience with [[http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/|ttfautohint]].
  The website offers a lot of information on hinting, but I can't find any information
  on how to actually use this software. I ran a ttf file through the program and it
  spit out a file without an extension. I added .ttf and it's a workable font which
  is 32kb bigger than the original file, so I assume it works. However, I don't know
  what the best settings are, and does anyone know if this can help me with hinting
  otf fonts as well? It doesn't run through the program in any case.\r\n\r\nThe reason
  I'm trying this software at all is because I recently finished my first typeface
  for a client and although he's very satisfied when it comes to the appearance of
  the typeface in print, he feels the rendering in PDFs should be better and I have
  to agree. I concluded it must be due to the fact the fonts haven't been hinted,
  but in all honesty I'm ignorant as to what I can do. The client isn't looking to
  spend more money so I figured ttfautohint is just what I needed."

  body: By the way, I know ttfautohint is for web typography but I guess I didn't
    realize until now that has nothing to do with the font embedding in PDFs, which
    should look fine. So what can I do to improve the appearance of my fonts in digital
    applications offline?

  body: "ttfautohint only adds truetype hinting, emulating the autohint used in FreeType.
    However TrueType hints are (for the most part) only used on windows systems, so
    they don't effect the way that PDFs are rendered. \r\n\r\nHowever to answer your
    second questions about what to do for improvement, I think we'll need some more
    images to see exactly what the issue(s) are.  "

  body: Using ttfautohint will also affect rendering in PDFs, at least when you view
    them with Adobe Reader or Acrobat.

  body: "But that only applies to ttf fonts then, right? Can I achieve greater results
    with a ttf than otf when it comes to PDF embedding?\r\n\r\nI just created a PDF
    and you can see there are some slight rendering issues where some characters are
    a tiny bit thicker:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Melk Sans PDF jpg_5354.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
    more obvious in Illustrator. Here's a screenshot:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Melk
    Sans AI screenshot_5992.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe /i for example has more weight than /l
    even though they're the exact same on the bottom part. In print the problem disappears
    so it really seems to be a rendering issue. What can I do to improve things?"

  body: "Hinting, whether of TrueType or PostScript outlines, affects most non-Apple
    rendering environments, including those from Microsoft, Adobe, and often FreeType*.\r\n\r\nWith
    \u201CAdobe\u201D you can include the rendering in Adobe Reader, Acrobat, InDesign,
    Photoshop and Illustrator\u2014even on Mac OS.\r\n\r\n* FreeType can be set to
    ignore hints in the fonts like Apple does, autohinting on the fly. Indeed, the
    TTFautohint hinting is based on the autohinting created for FreeType. But I gather
    many FreeType-based environments choose to respect the hinting in the font."

    you elaborate on this? I'm not quite sure what you're saying here. What do you
    mean with including the rendering?"
