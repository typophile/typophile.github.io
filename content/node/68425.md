    collection, but now I can only find it at freebie sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Carolus was originally made in 1953 by the Swedish type designer Karl-Erik
    Forsberg and released by \"Berlingska stilgjuteriet i Lund\". He was a gifted
    calligrapher and over the years he made some hundred hand drawn book covers apart
    form designing typefaces.\r\n\r\nIt's a pain to see that someone just ripped it
    off and put it up on \"Dafont\".\r\n\r\nMore info here;\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Erik_Forsberg\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n/Stefan

  body: "Stefan, thanks for the background on the typeface. I agree it's a shame that
    the version available is not a quality commercial version, but I do not know of
    anything better at this time. Do you? According to Grant Hutchinson, who used
    to run Image Club before he helped start Veer, they dropped a number of their
    old Letterpress collection fonts, including Carolus Roman, because their digitizations
    were too poor quality for then current standards. I think the version on Dafont
    is a revival of the design, because I don't believe it is even as good as the
    Image Club version (which I have).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nMaybe I should do some effort and digitize this typeface myself.
    Karl-Erik worked for long at one of\r\nthe biggest publisher in Sweden - Norstedts.
    I've been in contact with them a few times and the probably\r\nown and have loads
    of base material from that time. We have had some loose discussions about\r\nmaling
    Carolus as well. I'll have to look into this again.\r\n\r\nDafont even present
    a disgusting italic version which have never been done originally. More slanted
    btw\r\nand badly executed.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Stefan, \r\n\r\nThat would be great if you created a version of this typeface.
    It deserves to be done in a quality way by someone who wants to do it justice.
    I would look forward to that one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just came across another effort to use some of this typeface done by Garrett
    Boge and Paul Shaw for LetterPerfect/Monotype. See [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/stockholm_std_regular/?&sample_text=NICOLE%20%26%20RYAN%20SOUP&update=0|Stockholm]].
    It's not identical to the sample, but you can see the influence of the Forsberg
    designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Stefan\r\n\r\nThere is a full character set in Lindegren's ABC collection
    should you need a good reproduction. Boge/Shaw's version is very different but
    still based on Forsberg's work... heavier and different character interpretation.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was in Stockholm I was overjoyed at the residual influence of this mans \"monumental\"
    talent."
