body: "(From the January issue of [[Linotype]]'s <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/38-21255/issue200701.html\">LinoLetter</a>)\r\n\r\nFor
  more than half a century, Prof. [[Hermann Zapf]] has been designing typefaces that
  have helped define how our world communicates. Now we are pleased to present his
  newest series of families, Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal. An extension
  of the [[Palatino]] idea, which was first made manifest in 1950, these groundbreaking
  sans serif typefaces offer another interpretation of the sans serif genre. Whether
  set alone or used in combination with each other or the Palatino, Palatino Linotype,
  or Palatino nova typefaces, Prof. Zapf\u2019s new font families bring a new level
  of subtlety to typography. In celebration of the release of these new families,
  customers who make any purchase at Linotype.com through February 28, 2007, will
  receive Palatino Sans Informal Light as a test font \u2013 absolutely free!\r\n\r\nMore

    as a longtime fan of Zapf''s work, looking at this on screen I find it a big dissapointment. '

  body: "<em>these groundbreaking sans serif typefaces</em>\r\n\r\nWe've seen informal
    faces before. Sumner Stone has done a few.\r\nWe've seen underexposed/overexposed
    and \"press gain\" artefact faces effect before -- from Akira in Acanthus, for
    instance.\r\n\r\n<em>a new level of subtlety</em>\r\n\r\nWe've had micro-detailed
    sans faces before. Cronos, for instance, approaches it from the typographic direction,
    whereas Highlander does so from the lettering direction. Both these are faces
    carried by Linotype. \r\n\r\nThis is not about the typeface, but about the marketing
    and publicity.\r\nIt's Palatino that isn't, with dodgy hype.\r\nFor Zapf and Typophile,
    it could be tighter.\r\n\r\n"
