body: "I have created an OpenType font of symbol characters in Fontographer, some
  glyphs of which are quite long. The font loads into FontExplorer on a Mac, and works
  perfectly in InDesign. However MS Word will not load the font, although if I copy
  and paste from InDesign it works OK, and reappears after quitting and reopening
  the Word file.\r\n\r\nThere also appears to be a limit on how wide a character can
  be, as after typing some of the characters, the cursor sits within the character
  such that the next character overlaps and cannot be seen.\r\n\r\nTwo problems then:\r\n\r\nMaximum
  width of glyph?\r\nWhy doesn't Word like it?"
