In the case of the M-formula, I see a purely logical path, based on observation and experience, from the marionette to the typeface, as explained by Dwiggins in his own words. If this connection had been made by someone with only a passing knowledge of either marionette or type making, then I'd ascribe it to intuition. In the case of someone like Dwiggins, who was intimately and daily involved in the making of both marionettes and type, the connection might even seem to be an obvious one. Perhaps the lesson in this is that type designers benefit from having other hobbies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Re.

		<div class="commentbody">The M-formula as laid out in the document of July 3, 1937, is a typically engaging expression of WAD's ideas along these lines; but it was not a sudden epiphany on Dwiggins part. Neither was it formulated specifically in relation to newspaper designs, as one might infer from Unger's article. I have evidence of at least two earlier documents outlining some of the same ideas &ndash; although neither of these specifically mentions marionettes. One of these, in fact, from February of the same year, is essentially a proto-M-formula. I haven't tracked down the drawings to see whether he put these ideas into practice before the July document. The application of the theory to small, newspaper types came about a year later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My point is that the M-formula is a culmination of thinking that WAD had been doing in this direction for about two years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To get back to Dwiggins and logic/intuition (after a very short nap). I think the most serious attack we can make on him in relation to the above experiment concerns the serious anachronism inherent in his perception of the Irish-English/semi-uncial as an essentially 'English' letter. I'm wondering what the level of scholarship was like on that sort of thing in the 1940s? What sources might he have been using? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the 8th and 9th centuries the 'English' he's talking about didn't exist yet.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I've seen the King's Fount, but I don't recall in what books it is shown (perhaps the brilliant and eclectic <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Typographical Printing Surfaces<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?). I think I recall Matthew Carter showing it in his talk on experimental type design at ATypI 94 in San Francisco. It is truly hideous, and also very difficult to read due to the almost complete absence of extenders. Basically, Ricketts took the view that all legibility was in the x-height ergo one could dispense with ascenders and descenders. It is, perhaps, an object lesson in the importance of the distinction between legibility and readability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aha! I may be mistaken in my memory of the King's type, and might be confusing it with another experiment of the same period. I've tracked down an illustration of a type by Ricketts that may, in fact, be the King's type, and it is not as I remembered it. It is still pretty horrid, but does not display the bloated x-height and truncated extenders that I must be remembering from something else. Unfortunately, the illustration is not captioned, so I can't be absolutely certain that this is the King's type, but it makes sense in the context of Dwiggin's comments. Also, the title of the work is The Kingis Quair. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Additionally, I found mention online that the King's Fount is shown in Goudy's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typologia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I don't have my copy handy.</div>
