<p>Am I the only one who thinks this doesn&rsquo;t belong in the Hot New Fonts? I think it has very poor spacing and it doesn&rsquo;t take optical illusions in account. For example the strokes don&rsquo;t get thinner where they meet the stem, which creates a very ugly dark spot. If you&rsquo;re wondering why I post this: Well, I&rsquo;m just very frustated crappy fonts like this actually sell. It seems as if the people who are supposed to be selecting the typefaces, do so without enough knowledge, which makes typedesign based on fashion, instead of lasting beauty. This mkes me seriously reconsider Myfonts as a platform to sell my expletus.</p>

So, if this font, and others, are in the Hot fonts is because someone like them and buy them. Artists works to the Kings, and to the people too. Vox Populi Vox Dei.</div>

<p>Who says every typeface has to be designed the same way? A lot of these nuances don&rsquo;t make a huge difference (sometimes) in large display sizes. Maybe the designer <em>wanted</em> it to look blocky/have &ldquo;ugly dark spots.&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say it&rsquo;s a poorly designed typeface&hellip; it may have a proper application somewhere, perhaps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">&ldquo;Jasper, you’re far too young to have such a big stick up your ass. At least get a degree from an art school before you get so snotty.&rdquo; Ok let&rsquo;s be honest. Whether it&rsquo;s arrogant or not, I think it simply doesn&rsquo;t look good at all. I might not have a degree from an art school, but I do believe I can reasonably judge the quality of typeface. Maybe I was exaggerating in this post, but I&rsquo;m still very surprised that this typeface is so popular. I think if the designer deliberately made it look &lsquo;weird&rsquo; (I can&rsquo;t make any more of it.), he should have made this clear in the description. From his description it seems he justed wanted to create simple, elegant, somewhat geometrical typeface. Arrogant or not, with or without art school degree, I think he failed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jasper, once you have a few years type design experience you will look back on this post and laugh with embarrassment. OK, so you&rsquo;ve had some positive feedback on the Critique forum - it doesn&rsquo;t mean Expletus is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>Pomposity is not an admirable trait in the young, (nor the old for that matter).</p>
<p>The strange thing about type design is that when we first start down that path we all think we&rsquo;ve just created the most brilliant, wonderfully original font ever, and praise and admiration must surely immediately follow. With a few typefaces under your belt you may revise your original opinion and think &ldquo;Hmmm, it&rsquo;s OK I suppose&rdquo;. A few more years down the line you may think to yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too bad at this now, I might even be pretty good eventually&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This post reminds me of that Mark Twain quote about experience and the passage of time:
“When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished by how much he&rsquo;d learned in seven years.”</p>

You didn&rsquo;t know this yet, but I&rsquo;ve already released two VERY ugly fonts. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Designtown/">http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Designtown/</a>
I realise, that I won&rsquo;t be able to release a succesful typeface untill I have a degree from an art school. Now let me ask you a question. Not becease I think I already know the answer, but because I want to know the truth. Do you think this (knul) is a good typeface? How is it compared to expletus?</p>
<p>I never said that I consider expletus worthy to be in the Hot New Fonts, nor do I think so. I just think that this (knul) typeface isn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This makes me seriously reconsider Myfonts as a platform to sell my expletus.&rdquo; This does sound very arrogant at a second look, but all I meant was that Myfonts atracts the kind of customers that I might not want to be associated with. If I do have an art school degree and a good font in the future, maybe I don&rsquo;t want to be &lsquo;that guy from myfonts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The rest is just my opinion about the font with, what i thought, are good arguments. I posted it on typophile, because i wanted to know what you thought about it, hence the question above in this comment.</p>

<p>That, surely, is the premise of MyFonts, and has nothing to do with the quality of any particular font.
The only bad fonts are those which have encoding that doesn&rsquo;t work properly, or that are too obviously knock-offs.
Otherwise, it&rsquo;s the typographer&rsquo;s responsibility to make &ldquo;good&rdquo; typography (however that is defined), and contrary to the old saying that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear&rdquo;, &ldquo;if you are given lemons, make lemonade&rdquo;.</p>

Maybe I would not have reached it ever.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on how you study. Sitting around like in school, waiting for the wisdom to be put into your head by professors you get obviously nowhere. But if you get into action and understand studies as a base for your initiative it is a great catalyst.</p>
<p>As for the degree itself - a paper prooving you sit your ass flat for 4 years - yes. Completely useless. What counts is what you did with your time in university.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but this does sound arrogant, making your first proper typeface, but already sure you want to exclude certain customers from buying it just because they have bad taste (in your opinion)&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t show much respect for them, as you don&rsquo;t even know them. And by the way: Hot new fonts are defined purely by the amount of items sold, it doesn&rsquo;t judge the quality of them. And sales don&rsquo;t define a good typeface perse, otherwise Helvetica would not be such a big seller even after all those years.</p>
<p>And about art school, it schould perhaps not be overrated, but it does help, it thaught me a lot, maybe not the things I should have been thaught, but still a lot ;-)</p>

<p>What one person thinks beautiful another will think ugly and vice versa. You can&rsquo;t say your sensibilities are more refined than anyone else&rsquo;s, again that suggests a certain arrogance on your part.</p>
