  trouble understanding all the steps I need to go through to make a lot of the OpenType
  features work. I understand the concept and I get what most of it means, but it's
  like I'm missing some pieces to the puzzle.\r\nSo are there any books or any tutorials
  you can suggest that cover the basics of OpenType (hopefully addressing FontLab
  specifically)?\r\nThanks!!"
