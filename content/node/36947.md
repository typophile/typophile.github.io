  the sans-serif paired with a slab denoting motion. Does anyone know any fonts that
  look similar/have the same effect?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTal[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_3667.jpg]"

    for Mostra\r\nThe poster is hand lettered and you can emulate you requested style
    in Adobe Illustrator."

  body: Any idea what geometric sans fonts look like the one above? Mostra was a little
    too fashion-y I thought - The wide "C" and "O" for instance, and the snake-like
    "S". I'm looking for a more uniform narrow feel. I love the "M" in Film (above).
