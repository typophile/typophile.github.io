<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I found it interesting that a sign on the picture on the [[http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/01/04/todayspaper/index.html|front page of yesterday's New York Times]] from Barack Obama's campaign was set in Gotham, so I started wondering what fonts all of the candidates are doing.
Here are some general trends I noticed by looking at their websites. All but Edwards use serif fonts for their names in their logos. Clinton and Obama use Gotham pretty much everywhere, and their font usage seems most standardized of all the candidates. Edwards also uses Gotham, but his site uses other fonts too.
I doubt it's a coincidence that Clinton, Obama and Edwards all use Gotham, but no other candidates seem to have decided to use the same font as each other. (At least two others are using Helvetica, but that could have been a coincidence.)
I was hoping to find cooler trends, but I didn't. Maybe someone else who's bored will find this interesting and look for some more.
I'm also wondering whether anyone has <em>consciously</em> taken the quality of the design of the candidates' campaign materials in selecting whom to vote for.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Obama's is the most interesting and thoughtful logo by far, but yeah, his materials use Gotham just like the others. It's too bad that the candidates' campaigns would miss this opportunity to set themselves apart. Still, as much as I'm opposed to homogeneity, Gotham is not a bad choice for a U.S. candidate. It's much more American than Helvetica.</div>

I hadn't really looked at Avenir before, but now I have, and it looks like that to me too. The most obvious difference is in the punctuation. I was surprised that a font designed for GQ magazine would also be used for a presidential campaign, but I hadn't realized how popular Gotham is.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I drove through Iowa this weekend, a few days after their primary. There were still many campaign signs up, so we got a good look at the variations.
I got to say, that EDWARDSO8 all jammed together, does not work very well. Particularly in the 1-color version we saw, white type on a deep blue field. Speeding by it on an Interstate or puttering by it down a farm road, it was not reading very well. Cheryl asked: "Does it say 'EDWARD SOB' "? Last time out, when Edwards was running for veep with John Kerry, the signs looked like they were pimping for a guy named "Kerry Edwards," and in fact some reporters dug up folks with that name. Now it looks like someone's mad at some guy name Edward who is a son of a b****. No wonder this guy lags today in New Hampshire.
Obama's O logo looks amazingly like the logo for a church which I assume to be a conservative Christian church in northern Iowa. Drove by in bad weather too fast for a photo. But I know it pre-dates O's run for the top job.
Oh, well. Just keep in mind that type and design are not very good criteria when you must decide for whom you shall vote.

<div class=commentbody>@Sii: about topography: I don’t think you can modify the font used on the map that easily. I’m curious as to why they used Myriad (or, the reason why the default map typeface was set to that.)
Also, I think you meant to say that Dewmocracy “jumped on the Obama 2008 bandwagon,” yes? Because the site’s font is Gill :-)
I had actually <a href=http://linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2008/01/04/q-have-anyone-on-the-internet-identified-the-fonts-that-the-2008-presidential-candidates-used-in-their-campaign-logos-side-by-side/>attempted to type-ID</a> all of the 2008 presidential campaign logo a day before this topic was started—with moderate level of success. I believe that I was right in most of them, but I’m nowhere as typographically geeky as all you guys, so kindly drop a line if I was wrong.</div>

<div class=commentbody>American political design is all about looking as middle-of-the-road as possible. Even Lee L.

Democracy is a bit different here in Germany. We don’t elect candidates for president (since we don’t have a president as the executive). We elect political parties. All parties have been using quite sophisticated corporate designs lately.
CDU (biggest conservative party) uses FF Kievit as corporate typeface (custom version).
SPD (biggest socialist party) uses The Sans.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In The Netherlands we don't vote for a person (e.g. president) either. We elect political parties as well. What typefaces they use I dont know from memory, but a couple of parties are [[http://www.sp.nl/|SP]] (a condensed Univers or Helvetica), [[http://www.pvda.nl|PvdA]] (apart from the logo, not very consistent. I've seen multiple typefaces, like Scala Sans) and [[http://www.cda.nl/|CDA]] (also doesn't seem to be really consistent, apart from the logo). But I'm sure they all have official typefaces for their visual identity.</div>
