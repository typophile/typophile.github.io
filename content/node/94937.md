    long before even the relatively campy Tim Burton film version. The Christopher
    Nolan films are fairly alike to much of the last three decades of the comics,
    most obviously Frank Miller's Dark Knight series, which contains much of the incipient
    fascism that becomes pretty explicit in the last of the Nolan films. Heck, why

    hero stories are some what overblown. A more sophisticated, yet no more compelling
    version of the old concerns that comics would (... fill in the blanks... ) and
    ruin society.\r\n\r\nThis stuff is conceived of as simple and simplistic fantasy
    fiction that will make money. A  super hero who by some extraordinary means saves
    people from terrible dangers instantly and dramatically, motivated only by a sense
    of right and wrong and who acts entirely outside any of the typical constrains
    that tends to make stories about law enforcement wherein everyone operates by
    the rules very, very boring. \r\n\r\nBatman has no super power, so he needs a
    back story  that gives him access to extraordinary weapons and tools and lots
    of free time. Therefore the back story makes him the playboy heir to a vast industrial
    empire. That's all peripheral the the fact that his raison d'\xEAtre  is to punch
    the crap out of villains. \r\n\r\nNo one confuses this with real life. These stories
    take place in a Universe where you solve complex problems by punching the bad
    guy so hard he flies across the street and goes through a plate glass window,
    without causing any injury other than some slight grogginess. \r\n\r\nI'd bet
    you'd find more Batman comics in the homes of members of the Occupy movement than
    in the homes of the cops, the \"1%\" or any of the others Gavin Mueller says are
    propagandizing us. <cite>If</cite> that is their intention, they are not doing
    a very good job of it, although, the use of Helvetica does add some credence to
