  Round Light]]\r\n\r\nIts for a military interface for a game set a decade or two
  in the future. 232MKSD has the right kind of aesthetic but I'm open to completely
  different suggestions.\r\n\r\nPlus's :\r\n\r\nIts compressed (always useful for
  game interfaces). The bowls are vertical, c, e etc. Its legible at small sizes and
  has large open counters. The stroke weight is even so it will reproduce well on
  screen.\r\n\r\nMinus's:\r\n\r\nNeeds to be a slightly heavier weight. It is rounded
  which is too friendly for a military theme. I would like to try a more angular version
  like a condensed :\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/jillican/|jillican]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any suggestions, this site is such a great resource for type.\r\n\r\n"

    Maybe have a look at daFont.com for ideas too?\r\n\r\nYou saw that the 232D font
    has three weights, right?\r\n"

  body: "That's funny, I tried DIN condensed :)\r\n\r\nIsonorm is a bit rounded and
    doesn't really have the modern graphic feel I'm looking for. I found another font
    that was interesting on a leaflet, I'm going to post it to the Type ID board for
    identification, could be a contender.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "Thanks all, those are excellent recommendations. CreativeNRG, your recommendations
    are all spot on though I didn't shortlist any because I think they would be a
    little less legible at the smaller sizes, it will get compressed a lot and the
    quality really deteriorates in game. United is a very good contender but I have
    a complaint about House Industries  site, its virtually impossible to sample fonts
    so makes it really difficult to evaluate against those from myfonts.com which
    have excellent sampling options.\r\n\r\nFor your interest I think we've narrowed
    it to Quantico, Jillican, Milibus, CA Monodon, Coupe and Baksheesh from Myfonts.com,
    Blender Pro from Gestalten and United from House Industries. They're mostly condensed,
    octagonal and I think they have a military geometric aesthetic.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again everyone."

  body: Yes, unless I'm mistaken you can set one or two words against a picture background
    only. Virtually useless to me compared to myfonts.com. I can't even set the exact
    size unless I'm missing something.
