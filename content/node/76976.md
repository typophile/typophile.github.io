  a current project. The only problem is that I've not heard of this term before.
  I supplied a sample with a good number of different style brackets but apparently
  none of them were \"chain\" brackets. Before I expose my ignorance to the client,
  can anyone give me a hint as to what the term \"chain\" brackets might refer to?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n"

  body: I believe that the "chain" refers to a kind of equation, and the brackets
    are simply ordinary brackets inserted into the chain...

    brackets' or 'braces', namely '{ }'.

  body: "These are named Braceleft and Braceright in Unicode.\r\n\r\nThe brackets
    shown in Riccardo's post are a stylistic variant of the editorial (square) Bracket,
    AFAIK.\r\nI recall first becoming aware of them in some of Goudy's fonts, seen
    in old printed matter.\r\nHowever, I don't believe that any digital Goudy revivals
    have incorporated that effect into the bracket glyph.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    illustrated in eliason's post. I would most likely have referred to them as curly
    brackets (as opposed to square and normal parenthesis). \r\n\r\nMystery solved.
    Thanks very much for the help.\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: "A web search turned up many hits in which chain brackets were things you
    attached a chain to, but in Google Books the first three hits in a row that referred
    to something on paper did give them as the curly braces.\r\n\r\nThe term is not
    used in \"The Printing of Mathematics\"; I'm not sure if I'm equal to the task
    of hunting up <em>where</em> it is a popular term for braces. But here are the
    instances I found:\r\n\r\nTheory of Differentiation: a unified theory of differentiation
    via new derivate theorems and new derivatives\r\nVolume 24 (Canadian Mathematical
    Society series of monographs and advanced texts)\r\nKrishna M. Garg\r\nJohn Wiley
    & Sons\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to Hilbert Space\r\nNicholas Young\r\nCambridge
    University Press\r\n\r\nProceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Operators
    and Function Theory\r\nEd. S. C. Power\r\nD. Reidel Publishing\r\n\r\nthe reference
    to \"chain brackets\" in that volume was in the paper\r\n\r\nInterpolation by
    Analytic Matrix Functions\r\nN. J. Young\r\n\r\n... so it appears that one Nicholas
    Young is responsible for <strong>two</strong> of the first three hits I get for
    this term! I wonder if I can conclude from that that this is a rare usage?"
