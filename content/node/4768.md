body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I know the name of this font, but nothing else. <BR>I just received
  a pdf from a potential client. She hasn&#39;t embedded the font, so its been replaced
  in the document. Its a true type font called &#39;shorthand&#39;, and I can&#39;t
  find it anywhere. <BR>It could be a freebie, or a commercial font. <BR> <BR>Any
  ideas? <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR>Steve
