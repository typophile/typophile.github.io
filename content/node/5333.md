body: I am helping a friend make a wedding invitation and they have submitted to me
  a font that they would like to use &#40;or something very similar&#41;. It is listed
  as SAR. I can&#39;t find it anywhere on the web. It is a very elongated serif font,
  with a deco/20&#39;s feel to it. I have been to many sites and still can not find
  it. If it helps, all of the lower case letters have the same cap height with acsenders
  as tall as upper case cap height.

  body: This is an old metal foundry typeface called Typo Roman. I&#39;m sure there
    is a digital version of this somewhere, but I checked the usual sources and couldn&#39;t
    find it. No doubt it&#39;s traveling under an assumed name.
