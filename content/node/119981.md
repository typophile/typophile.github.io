body: "I am just a design student at my Sophomore year. I've spent my summer with
  a letterprint artist and had made my own prints. School program offers too few opportunities
  to learn actual type (other than some basic Bringhurst and Swiss people) so I'm
  thinking applying for type-related internships, whether they be inside US or outside
  US (Europe or Japan...?) I'm thinking it would be optimal to work for a production
  type designer or a design company.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations for internship-searching?"

    your specific demographics (location, cost, etc.) and apply directly to them.
    Don't give up on any one of them, too; persistence sometimes pays!
