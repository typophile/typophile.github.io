body: Hi everyone. I'm looking to make a hand drawn, brush font that retains the textures
  and qualities of a thin ink, like a watercolour stroke. Specifically, I like the
  way the colour tint shifts and changes. Does anyone have any recommendations for
  the best way to approach this type of font?

    use the brush tool at any where between 20 and 50% opacity to apply the colors.\r\n"

    forgot to say that the \"letters\" must be filled with white first! Sorry."

    of yours, so I'm sure you can help him.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part though is actually
    <em>delivering</em> a colored (or even textured) font...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    building doesn't allow tints or colors.

  body: "Thanks for the comments. Yeah, that texture is easy enough to achieve in
    Photoshop, but I was wondering about building a font file that had more of a paint
    texture and quality.\r\n\r\nPhotoFont and BitFonter look interesting. "
