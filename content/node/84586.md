body: "Gold leaf lettering makes an office door something special.\r\nThese samples
  are from the Millennium Centre, an old bank building in Winnipeg, Canada.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6041958393_45d7efabe4_5089.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6041952131_6db0938863_5690.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  word \"MANAGER\" looks like a condensed Franklin Gothic. And the spacing between
  the A and G is a bit gappy, but it still has a certain appeal.\r\n\r\nThe numerals
  on \"601\" look like some kind of bold Baskerville, based on that teardrop terminal
  on the 6."
