    in PDfs.

  body: John - you could always outline the paths. <BR> <BR>On the other hand fonts
    are created to be used and as such should be allowed to be embedded. I&#39;m not
    sure how you could actually recreate a font from a pdf? Maybe the licenses should
    be more relaxed. <BR> <BR> I&#39;m aware of some licenses allowing printers/prepress
    houses to use a copy for the express purpose of printing that document. All licenses
    should reflect real world usage - who wants to pay good money for a one off usage
    of a font only have it unprintable due to a printer not having it? &#40;Or paying
    extra on the print job for the same reason!&#41; <BR> <BR>

  body: 'It&#39;s easier to recreate the font is you use PDFs with fonts converted
    to outlines. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty imposible &#40;as far as I know&#41; to
    extract the outlines from PDF 1.5 or 1.6. <BR> <BR>About licensing: I admire smaller
    type foundries and individual designers who offer MUCH more flexible licensing.'

  body: Marius, call or e-mail a font retailer &#40;Veer, FontShop, etc.&#41; that
    carries the Font Bureau line. They&#39;re more likely to be responsive. The nice
    folks at Veer made me a PDF a few months ago.

    documents using the Font Software for the purposes of output printing at a service
    bureau or printer. </i> <BR> <BR>is this contradictory or what? are EULAs always

  body: Marius, I hope you don&#39;t think me picky. I&#39;m not at all keen on embedding
    restrictions. You might want to take a look at Unit, from Font Shop. I think their
    EULA is looser.

  body: Unit &#40;Erik Spiekermann and Christian Schwartz&#41; and Amplitude  <BR>&#40;Christian
    Schwartz&#41; have some similarities. Amplitude is more  <BR>of a display face
    and Unit is more a workhorse face - even though <BR>that&#39;s a fine line given
    their similarities. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve gotten a chance to use Unit a fair bit and
    like it a lot. I&#39;m  <BR>looking for the right excuse to use Amplitude cuz
    it&#39;s mighty  <BR>tasty looking.

  body: 'Marius -- <BR> <BR>I alerted Harry Parker at Font Bureau to your unanswered
    e-mail. He said he&#39;s been swamped and hasn&#39;t been able to answer all the
    general e-mail. I hope that he has replied to you by now. If not, let me know.
    <BR> <BR>Re: Font Bureau EULA. <BR>This is not an official interpretation, so
    don&#39;t quote me . . . but, I believe the FB license is meant to allow embedding
    for a PDF print workflow, when the document is just being sent to a service bureau
    or commercial printer for direct output to film or plates for print reproduction.
    And to allow embedding in uneditable documents for sharing with clients for comping
    and approval purposes only.  <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I believe what they want
    to curtail &#40;without an expanded, specific license for such&#41; is embedding
    for digital documents that are being published and distributed online or in an
    all-digital environment -- i.e., where the digital document is the end-product.
    Or editable documents that are meant to be passed back and forth in a workgroup
    and edited using the embedded fonts by others who don&#39;t have the fonts licensed
    and resident on their machine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve alerted FB that this is an area
    of confusion and frustration, and I&#39;ve been told that they&#39;re in the process
    of clarifying what the EULA allows and forbids in this regard. <BR> <BR>Hope this
    helps. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>'

    address seems to be getting tons of spam, and I wrote to Harry, who has been very
    helpful. <BR> <BR>About embedding in PDFs: as far as I know, this is reminiscent
    from the old days when you could extract at least the glyphs from the temporary
    files Acrobat created when reading a PDF. <BR> <BR>It seems that extracting fonts
    from PDF version 1.5 or better is impossible. Maybe Thomas Phinney could tell
    us more? <BR> <BR>Same thing goes with Flash - most embedded glyphs are optimized,
    and lose details - they are not original shapes. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think foundries
    should adapt their EULA to take into account the current technologies, and not
    restricting the users. <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Regarding embedding and extracting fonts from PDF: <BR> <BR>- yes, it is
    technically possible to extract fonts from PDFs. The kerning and any additional
    layout tables will generally be lost. Any glyphs not embedded will be lost. <BR>
    <BR>- More recent flavors of PDF make it even harder in that the encoding is very
    non-obvious. Of course, it once the font is in a font editor one can re-encode
    it, but there&#39;s extra work involved, probably manual work. <BR> <BR>Generally,
    Adobe does not claim that PDF is secure against having fonts extracted. But stuff
    gets lost along the way, and there are much easier methods of pirating fonts.
    We use PDFs for samples and such of our own fonts, and do not know of any significant
    real-world piracy resulting from this practice &#40;although some font developers
    have certainly demonstrated the theoretical possibility&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regards,
