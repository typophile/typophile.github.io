  mine, sorry)? I know I know this and will probably kick myself when I see the solution.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery_face1_5453.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery_face2_4115.jpg]"

    about the face he was selling.\r\nEven more sadly I have lost the bid so now I
    will never know I suppose:)"

    have been much easier to see that if there had been an impression made from the
    type. Great job of visualizing Lex!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think if you look closely at all the letters it's clear that Ritmo is similar,
    but not a match. Look at the V, for example. Ritmo has no gap anywhere in that
    letter, but this type does.\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly hard to visualize this, because
    the solid (raised) part is the shadow, not the letter itself, which is actually
    the voids outlined by the shadow. I think Lex got it right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
