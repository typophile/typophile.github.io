  Larger scale image attached.\r\nI don't know of a digital font that matches, but
  perhaps there is something from metal type or the photo-type/contact-letter sheet
  era?\r\nFailing that, does anyone know of any more letters in this style? Perhaps
  the letters are  modeled on something from a lettering book? Any more book covers
  by this publisher or others?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nDon"

    if based on a formalized style.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, a blackletter called Enzian
    exists (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/polygraph/enzian/), but it definitely has
    a different style.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Riccardo for the link to a nice modern blackletter.\r\nI realize that
    the book tile is hand lettered, but I was hoping that it might have been inspired
    by a font of some sort. \r\nFailing that I would love to see any more lettering
    in this style.\r\nPerhaps one of our super lurkers might have some ideas.\r\nDon"

  body: "Two modern reinventions of the blackletter that, in my opinion, share some
    aspects with this nice kind of square wide fat lettering:\r\nhttp://www.type-together.com/Eskapade\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/moyenage/\r\n\r\nThere
    are others but, for what I can see, they tend to resolve contrast eliminating
    thin strokes and replacing them with the pointed terminals of wide strokes. Also,
    most of them go for an hexagonal grid, which prevents horizontal strokes of some
    substance."

  body: "Thanks Riccardo, for mentioning Eskapade & Moyen Age. I had looked at them
    some time ago and liked what I saw as good reinterpretations of blackletter.\r\n\r\nI
    agree the hexagonal grid in many blackletter updates is not good. In my opinion
    it is too mechanical and too far from what makes blackletter appealing -- the
    variation in strokes and emphasis which can sometimes give an effect that is both
    organic and dramatic, as is well expressed in this lettering.\r\nAnyone else with
    some leads or thoughts?\r\nDon"

    target='_blank'>Rustikalis Black</a>, even though it's quite different. similar
    in its quirkiness only. From the 1970's for the photolettering company, VGC (Mr.
    Wooden fails to give attribution for his revivals).
