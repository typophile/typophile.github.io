body: "How do you go about producing a comprehensive kerning table for a font that
  implements many accented roman glyphs? I am not talking about auto-kerning, which
  guesses at kerning values, as I would prefer to adjust everything by eye. My problem
  is the sheer volume of kern pairs, once one goes beyond an alphabet without accents
  and modified letters.\r\n\r\nIn the font editor I use (Fontforge on Linux), I can
  kern by classes, so I can treat all accented capital As as one glyph, for example.
  The problem with this is that it produces a very large kerning table, which I am
  sure contains many kern pairs that could not occur in any real text, because no
  real alphabet uses all the accents. For example, say we produce a base kern pair
  for Ac. In the first three Unicode blocks, there are ten variants of A, and six
  variants of c, so we generate sixty kern pairs. We have a kern pair for Aring-ccedilla,
  but I am fairly sure that there is no word in any language that has such a combination.\r\n\r\nThis
  problem might be a limitation of the application I use, which is free software.
  Maybe commercial font editors eliminate impossible kern pairs. I would welcome comments
  about this.\r\n\r\nAnother point is whether a bloated kerning table is a real problem.
  Does it slow down typesetting applications? Is a font judged to be of lower quality
  if it has a bloated kerning table?\r\n\r\nThe approach I am looking at presently
  is write a programme to scan spelling dictionaries for actual letter pairs. I have
  downloaded a few dictionaries (French, Polish, and Czech) that are intended for
  use with the Unix ispell application. Ideally, I need dictionaries for all the languages
  supported by my character set. From these dictionaries, I hope to produce a big
  table of actual letter pairs. After generating a bloated kerning table using Fontforge,
  I would filter the generated kern pairs, eliminating any that are not represented
  in the letter pair table. So far, I have produced tables of letter pairs from various
  files that come with the dictionaries.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The font format I usually use is Postscript Type1. I have used kerning by
    classes in Fontforge, which greatly reduces the work involved in handling many
    glyph variants. However, a quick trial generated about 4500 kern pairs, which
    I thought looked excessive.\r\n\r\nDoes OpenType have class-kerning built in to
    the format?\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is a thread in Build which already covers
    this topic. I missed it before I posted here."
