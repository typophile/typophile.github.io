  of the font, but I have no idea who makes it or what it&#39;s called, any ideas?

  body: 'Uhm, It&#39;s used in &#40;some&#41; Japanese games for English text. I ripped
    it off the disc from Persona 2: TSUMI for PlayStation. It&#39;s also used in the
    English version of Resident Evil 0 for GameCube, might also be in the remake of
    Resident Evil for GameCube. I think I&#39;ve also seen it used in some pictures
    from Japanese websites. That&#39;s all I know.'
