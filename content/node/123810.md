body: "Hello!\r\nI am new here on the board and try to find out the name of the following
  font type of the title logo font:\r\nhttp://dessign.net/unittheme/\r\n\r\nI also
  attached an image of the font in this post!\r\n\r\nI tried different font recognition
  tools online but none of them could tell me the exact font name. On \"WhatFontIs\"
  I could find the font \"Moderna Condensed Black\" that is similar to it but not
  exactly the same:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/los-andes/moderna-condensed/black/\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your help!\r\n\r\nSteven"

    font looks like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Various%20%2F%20Brownfox%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Archive%20-%20Regular&fid=08aae9f020949051ff8331be100607cb&fsize=60&text=CREATIVE&wrap=2|Archive]]</strong>
    by Slava Kirilenko [Brownfox, 2011].\r\nThe only problem is the font has round
    corners, but I think it's the correct one (modified corners?).\r\n\r\n"
