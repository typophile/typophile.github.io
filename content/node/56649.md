    for this too. I've only seen it four different times but those were all fairly
    recent book jackets designed by David Mann for Bloomsbury in the UK, so thought
    it might be something custom of his. This is one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/imperial_5033.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    other covers are for Zugzwang by Ronan Bennet, Trauma by Patrick McGrath and Agent
    Zigzag by Ben Macintyre\r\n\r\nI did ask for an ID here a while back but didn't
    have any luck.\r\n\r\nIt's a pity you didn't use a better title for your thread.
    It might be hard for me to find if I come back in a few days!"

  body: Thanks Jan. I really like the C, G and S but there are some other clumsy letters
    too, such as the B. They look alright on the David Mann jacket designs where they've
    been raised to give a more industrial look. Also he either altered the Z on the
    Zugzwang jacket which was the original sample I posted, or possibly used one from
    another font.
