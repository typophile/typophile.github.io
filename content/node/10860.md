  body: I believe the symbols origin is a sign for death.    <BR>It was marked on
    coffins. I think.   <BR>  <BR>A current use is to mark that a person is  <BR>deceased
    - in a body of text.   <BR>  <BR>If anyone has a copy of E.T.S. handy &#40; mine    <BR>is
    at home &#41; I am sure there is a section on it.    <BR>If no one comments further
    I will provide more    <BR>info tonight.   <BR>   <BR>-smc

  body: I have read E.T.S. &#40;you mean Bringhurst?&#41;. <BR>But it&#39;s not quite
    detailed. I think in the later use the confusion  <BR>or double signing dagger/cross
    is of course there, as today, and in the  <BR>following the use as a cross and
    sign of death or religious things.  <BR> <BR>But the early term &#34;obelisk&#34;
    doesn&#39;t seem to reference to the  <BR>cross as a religious symbol. &#34;asterisks
    and obelisks&#34; has been  <BR>a term for pro and contra in theological scientific
    dicussions  <BR>in the 16th century &#40;Martin Luther vs. Johannes Eck&#41;.
    And it results  <BR>from the signs used in the &#40;biblical&#41; text for marking
    marginals. In this  <BR>context it doesn&#39;t make sense if dagger/obelisk=cross  <BR>because
    asterisk and obelisk should be on the same level.  <BR> <BR>So my question is
    about the early development, the form, use and understanding  <BR>of the sign.
    Maybe there is any evidence for clarifying its first meaning <BR> - or even its
    double meaning from the beginning. <BR> <BR>Michael

    such dubious matter was thrust through,  <BR>as with a spit; the word is the same

  body: 'Matha, sean: thank you! <BR> <BR>interesting info!  <BR>There seem to be
    a lot of implications. But most of them come  <BR>from a later view &#40;especially
    those connections to paganism&#41;. <BR>To me it seems that the pointer root &#40;or
    roasting spit - nice!&#41;  <BR>is the most early. It makes the most sense, for
    with a pointer you can <BR>optically point out best those spurious or interesting
    passages within a text. <BR>This would imply that first there was no reference
    to religious symbols  <BR>may it be the cross or any other. <BR> <BR>And as far
    as I know those theologians &#40;I myself studied protestant theology&#41;,  <BR>they
    were much more rational and functional in their work. <BR>Maybe they didn&#39;t
    have a cross or something like that in mind.  <BR>Otherwise - I think - there
    should have been some reflection on this use of a symbol. <BR>Very interesting
    for me: Those mathematics-use. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;d like to trace it to the ground:
    Does any of you know early manuscripts  <BR>or prints with the dagger where its
    form and meaning can be seen? <BR> <BR>Michael'

    leading me there. <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I like to dig out a natural
    understanding and use of that symbol. <BR>I think it&#39;s much more nice, humanistic
    and feeding visual competence  <BR>to use asterisk, dagger, double-dagger and
    pilcrow for marking marginals and similar things in some cases, <BR>than those
    always boring numbers, who always remind of scientific essays. <BR> <BR>But with
    &#40;mis-&#41;understanding the dagger as a cross, its use is reduced to a few
