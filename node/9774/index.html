I am not an artist and could really use some constructive feedback.

		<div class="commentbody">The tire tracks will work on-screen but when you go to print them they will fill-in in smaller sizes and become a blob. You obviously recognize the problem with the lowercase r. It creates a terrible negative space gap. Have you looked at other typefaces? I think you need to.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basicly loose the Photoshop and Illustrator gimics(the tints the reflection the outlines). Make a logo that works in black and white and is strong. Most logos don't exist by themselves they are surrounded by images and words that reinforce the subject. The word here is KISS: Keep It Simple</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was only by looking at your website that I realised you were not involved in bicycles, which is what the tyre tracks had led me to assume. The letterforms need to be developed if you are going to stick with that sloped face, but it isn't working for the off-road &amp; performance line something simpler and easier to read is called for. Specifically the x t and r in your samples need work. The outlining is too much, especially where it encloses the whole logo, straighter lines without the indentations would be better. However, as a more important consideration, I did this search <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;imgsz=xxlarge&amp;amp;q=xtreme&amp;#43;logo">http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;imgsz=xxlarge&amp;amp;q=xtreme&amp;#43;logo</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> which reveals more xtremes than you would want to shake a stick at and none of them particularly noteworthy.  I would look at an image/shape (not an X) and treat the type simply. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In addition to what others have said about the font, the latest version does not read as xtreme to me at all.  I see a graphic, that will not produce well in small applications, and then the word &quot;treme.&quot;  You may also need to use the design in one color applications and this concept will not necessarily work well.  A logo should be able to successfully convey what you desire in multiple applications (web, print, signage, wearables, etc.) and I don't think this will do so as currently presented. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- J.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The logo in post #3 is, in my opinion, aiming squarely at the middle of the market and I think it hits the mark. While I agree that the design needs a lot of adjustment (the outline around the type is too slavish, making it bumpy and chipped, and the 'r' is a bit odd) the logo immediately communicates the X-treme Sprots feel you're shooting for. It does it in a very generic and expected way, but it does it. Though it doesn't say trucks to me, it's more biking and motocross. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to sit squarely in the middle of the crowd, then I think this direction works, if you want to be memorable, I'd try again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the most interesting part is the tire tracks, but their current design will be a mess at small sizes. The tire tracks are probably a good element to work with and create some unique and interesting visuals. The tread pattern alone could make some really bold and interesting opportunities for a designer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The logo looks more like a logo used by tuners (the kind of guys that put coffee cans on the exhausts of civics) than an off road company. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe looking a bit dirty and mudcovered might help a bit. Regarding the tire tracks - they look like street tracks not offroad trenches. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The logo doesn't seem suited to the respective market.  As other posters have mentioned, that syllable done in that type face is in need of a typographic intervention. :-)</div>
