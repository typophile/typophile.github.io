body: "I'm typesetting a friend's writing sample in philosophy, and I can't decide
  how to arrange and format the footnotes. (They must be footnotes, not endnotes.)
  I've attached an 8-page PDF. Each page is actually the same page of text but with
  the footnotes designed in a slightly different style. <!--break-->Here are the three
  main styles:\r\n\r\n1. Note number outdented; footnote text flush left with main
  text.\r\n\r\n2. Note number slightly indented, so that note text begins where indented
  paragraphs in main text begin.\r\n\r\n3. Note number indented, so that number appears
  where indented paragraphs in main text begin.\r\n\r\nEach style comes in two versions:
  one with a 2-inch rule separating the text from the notes and one without. The first
  style also has two more variations: one with a period after the note number and
  one without. In all of them, the main text is Aldus 12/15 and the footnotes are
  Aldus 10/13.\r\n\r\nI can't decide which of the three main styles I prefer. (An
  obvious fourth style would be to have the note numbers flush left with the main
  text.) The first is recommended by Bringhurst, but I don't think he has academic
  papers (with their sometimes long footnotes) in mind. I'm worried that the numbers
  standing outside of the margins draw too much attention to themselves.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any comments about or favorites among these different styles? Any suggestions
  for doing something different? (I know that the hyphenation needs work.)\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: I don't like the numbers outdented. I wrestled with the same situation recently
    - altho the notes were at the end of the chapter, not on each page. I checked
    a bunch of books for style, and ended up doing what you call the obvious fourth
    style, where the numbers were flush left with the main text (at least the longest
    number, as the numbers themselves were right aligned, and the text hung at the
    indent. It's a little less space-efficient but I also didn't put spaces between
    the notes themselves.

    footnote set in two columns (top aligned).   '

  body: "The usual style in the academic world is to use a paragraph indent for the
    note numbers, unless those numbers are also a superior. Outdenting the note numbers
    looks OK with loose leaves, but in a bound book, they are apt to get lost in the
    gutter on a right-hand (recto) page. If you want the note numbers flush to the
    text page & then block indent the notes proper (flush & hang), that's fine, though
    not as common. Cambridge University Press did this for a while, maybe still does.\r\n\r\nWith
    paragraph style, the numbers \"decimal align\" only per-page. In other words,
    if you have notes 1-7 one page, you do not \"clear for two digits.\" That happens
    only on the page where you go from one digit to two, and from two digits to three.\r\n\r\nUse
    of a rule may confuse some people. People reading this will be academics, who
    are use to footnotes. Usually, a rule is used when a footnote carries over from
    one page to the next. You always have to start a note on the page where it is
    called, but sometimes the footnotes are so long, there is no way to page the document
    without carrying part of the note over to the next page. In such cases, you use
    a rule to indicate the carried-over note. Three picas long is usually sufficient
    for the rule, but it can be full measure. If for some reason you must use a rule
    on all pages, make the normal rule a different measure than the rule you use to
    signal a carried-over note.\r\n\r\nOne of the oddest situations I've ever encountered
    was a journal article, where the first line of text called three footnotes. The
    third footnote took over three full pages to set, even in 8-point type. The forth
    note was called on the second line of text. After taking it over with the publisher,
    it was decided to set the article opening, the first line of text, then the notes
    on the rest of that page & the next two full pages (with rule, of course), before
    picking the text up again on the 4th page.\r\n\r\nObviously, a poorly written/edited
    piece. The author would have been better served to either incorporate the note
    in the text or make an appendix of it, and the editor surely should have pointed
    this out before accepting the article. But it happens.\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit:</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    is also unnerving for a reader to discover some designer feels that he/she needs
    \"help\" deciphering a normal situation. So, for example, you do not need extra
    spaces between footnotes, just like you do not need extra spaces between paragraphs
    in the text.\r\n\r\nFor example, some designers both block indent an extract,
    and set it in smaller type, so the reader \"won't get confused.\" What reader?
    Most people who read this sort of thing are use to block quotes, they aren't going
    to get confused. You might as well put a printer's fist beside the extract. You
    wouldn't believe the number of things I've seen by both designers and editors
    \"to keep the reader from getting confused\" when it is obvious that anybody reading
    the text is going to have a college education or more. What usually happens is
    the designer/editor adds to the reader's confusion. There are ways to graphically
    help the reader, but they are usually not by highlighting elements he/she expects
    to see anyway. \r\n"

    version I've seen is to use two different levels of notes: endnotes for citation
    stuff and less important information, and actual footnotes for important explanations,
    terms, and so on. Endnotes counted per chapter, footnotes with per-page symbols
    (*, dagger, \xA7). Useful, and the endnotes \"not distracting the reader\" (whoever

  body: "Since you've got your answer, I'll add another way to think about such things
    generally. Essentially, your question was \"how should one handle the element
    'footnotes'?\"\r\n\r\nThere is another way of thinking about the topic, which
    is, basically, \"how should the element 'footnotes' be blended into the text page?\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is probably old-school thinking. I saw <cite>Helvetica</cite> last night, and
    was struck not so much by those who did and did not like the typeface Helvetica,
    but the two schools of thought, modernism and postmodernism. One of the older
    modernists remarked that you cannot spend your whole life looking at things a
    certain way and just change. But postmodernism has been around long enough for
    one of those devotees to walk slowly & have white hair as well; they too have
    spent a lifetime looking at things a certain way.\r\n\r\nOK, back to the page.
    This is not a simple modernist versus postmodernist point of view; the notion
    of the type page is far older. I do suspect a postmodernist would disagree with
    what I'm about to say, but so too could a modernist.\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't
    like flush & hang footnotes is that it weakens the page. The page now has two
    distinct elements, the body text and the notes. Should these have a different
    graphic interpretation?  I suppose it depends on your point of view. Mine is no,
    the page is one of the things (aside form the content) that unites these elements.
    Just like a widow weakens the page, so too do flush & hang footnotes. So would
    a full-measure rule, which, unlike a rule below the running head block, will not
    appear at the same place on the page.\r\n\r\nThe situation is rather different
    with endnotes, either end-of-chapter or end-of-book. Here, the problem is to let
    the reader quickly find the appropriate note & reference it to the text. Running
    heads giving the page number help (Notes to pages 000-00). So to can flush & hang
    note numbers/notes.\r\n\r\nBut this is just one analysis, and nothing new. The
    real question a designer has to ask is whether the design problem is to work to
    display differing elements, or to work to integrate them.\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n\r\nCharles
