<p>The proper way to do something like this is to add the missing character(s) directly into the font, but most commercial fonts don&rsquo;t allow modification (which means you need to have the modification done by the font house itself, a proposition that&rsquo;s often expensive and sometimes slow). There are some notable exceptions to this, and all open-source (AKA libre) fonts allow modification, but you might want to keep an open mind about switching to a different font.</p>
<p>In the absolute worst case you can use a separate font with just the missing characters (in the same style) and sub that in as needed, but of course that&rsquo;s very inelegant (plus you can&rsquo;t kern across fonts).</p>
<p>So: Which Caslon?</p>

David Lemon at Adobe once told him it was OK for a third party (him) to modify someone else&rsquo;s fonts, and it probably is all right, though you can see from the long discussion below no one wants to be too terribly clear.</p>
<p>(For reference, aside form David Lemon, Christoper Slye is another Adobe employee, and Thomas Phinney was head of the group for a while, though I believe he&rsquo;d left when this thread occurred.)</p>

<hr>
<p>The character you mention is an IPA phonetic character &ndash; rather than an i with the combining diacritic U+0335. I&rsquo;m not sure if there is any real syntactical distinction between the two, but not being sure is enough to stay safe. Besides, few of the font publishers put in the combining diacritics (though according to Unicode, all should).</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s not a common phonetic character &ndash; others are usually needed in any phonetic context, I suspect it&rsquo;s for a &ldquo;Native American&rdquo; language. In fact, I think I&rsquo;ve seen it in an Mexican/Central American Indian language, newly given a written form.</p>
<p>Anyway, if that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;re apt to need other characters &ndash; or other phonetic characters, if it really is a case of phonetics. Best is to learn how to do the work yourself; alternatively, pick a font family where the work&rsquo;s already done &ndash; like Ross Mills Huronia, which covers most Native American orthographies.</p>

<p>You give some good advice on occasion, but I think here you&rsquo;re allowing our numerous past disagreements (which I feel stem mostly from your pervasive denigration of type designers) to replace objectivity with spite. Please don&rsquo;t cast aspersions on my work on Adobe fonts - there&rsquo;s nothing shady about it. I believe David Lemon, Christopher Slye and Thomas Phinney all trust me with this sort of thing.</p>

<p>What does rile me to no end is your 100+ posts per fortnight that only a <em>type designer</em> is capable of doing anything to a font &ndash; and often to a text &ndash;  save, perhaps, writing it and setting justified lines. Even here, some  type designers claim superiority. Maybe it&rsquo;s in the water?</p>
<hr>
<p>If one reads the thread I cited carefully, I think what you should come away with is the Adobe lawyers have written something, and no one is quite certain what it means. What one can get away with, yes. I think you&rsquo;re correct that the odds of a lawsuit are remote to none. It is a little different to say &ldquo;Adobe <strong>means</strong> this or that.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Calling my offer &ldquo;shameless&rdquo; is shameful. I only offer my paid services when it&rsquo;s not possible to help directly on Typophile; you&rsquo;re trying to undermine that, I suspect simply because you don&rsquo;t like me (along with pretty much all type designers it seems).</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&rsquo;re putting words in my mouth (and type designers collectively) possibly in order to fight a personal bugbear. Anybody who works with letterforms and/or their spacing -in a font- is a type designer, and you certainly don&rsquo;t need to have designed a stand-alone font to add a stroke to an &ldquo;i&rdquo;. However -unless you&rsquo;re going to perform some contorted hack- you <em>do</em> need a font editor, and you need to know how to use it. In fact you are a type designer yourself (although you should know that most typesetters are not). But not because you use InDesign! You have made ridiculous statements concerning the viability of typesetting software in carrying out typeface design - don&rsquo;t expect to get away with that in front of people who rely heavily on something like FontLab, for good reason. All this should be obvious to you, but I feel you&rsquo;re allowing some misplaced inferiority complex -or a convenient belief that type designers are leeches- to cloud your objectivity.</p>
<p>And lawyers? Here&rsquo;s a riddle I enjoy telling: What&rsquo;s 20,000 lawyers at the bottom of the sea? A good start. I don&rsquo;t care what lawyers <em>pretend</em> they believe; I care about what David, Christopher and Thomas believe. And to me it is people like that who represent Adobe&rsquo;s typographic presence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t offer my modification services because I think I can get away with it; I offer the service when I believe it&rsquo;s a legal, ethical and mutually beneficial solution.</p>
