  but alas the family is quite limited. Any suggestions for a (super) close alternative?\r\n\r\nI've
  considered [[http://www.ourtype.be/|Amalia]], [[http://www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=en&part=fonts&font=9|Dederon]]
  and [[http://underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview|Dolly]], but they
  don't quite make up for Alita's unique postmodern qualities. I've also considered
  [[http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html|Oxtail]] but it's way on the other
  end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nI understand I might just be stubborn, but thought I'd
  seek advice. Anything helps, thanks!"
