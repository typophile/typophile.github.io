  of all: using Brauer Neue for long settings of text (I am mostly concerned about
  kerning issues; if any?) in a life style publication targeted towards mid 3o's men
  with a \"sophisticated style\"? It should look elegant and up to date.\r\n\r\n2.
  Using it in the same publication with logotype set in Office by Lineto and an accompanying
  serif that would be a nice fit for both (Brauer Neue and Office)?\r\n\r\n3. I do
  not have these, so I can not see them set with some of the serifs I like for this
  (Filosofia and Baskerville maybe?) but I would be able to get one weight only and
  be creative with it. (It would make me happy to possess these.) :-)\r\n\r\n4. Since
  I have already set my mind on Office for the logotype; would it be smarter just
  to use something clean and safe with it like Akzidenz Grotesque or Franklin Gothic
  + plus a serif (Filosofia or Baskerville).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.Just be brutally honest
  please (I do have a thick skin): would this be insane?\r\n\r\nAny comment on any
  part of this would be greatly appreciated!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>Brauer Neue for long settings of text</em>\r\n\r\nWell, it depends how
    you set it, but IMO a condensed face is OK in sidebars, but not for the main body
    text.\r\n\r\nOffice and Brauer and dull in finish, so a precise, sharp serif would
    brighten up the magazine. \r\n\r\nIf you like Filosofia, you might also consider
    <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf\">Scotch Modern Display</a>,
    with features such as unicase, small caps, and alternate figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
