  line and was wondering what the laws were about using a typeface? I know that Bodoni,
  Clarendon and Univers are all rather old typefaces and wanted to know if older typefaces
  like that are royalty free or if typefaces can even be royalty free after a particulier
  amount of time like it works for music and images. and if so, does that count for
  their original creation date or if it changes when they move from foundry to foundry
  and when they get updates. for example, Bodoni was originally created back in the
  1700's but what about bodoni std poster, would that fall under the same Bodoni copyright?
  Do I need to find out who owns it and contact them?\r\n\r\nWhat about new typefaces?
  I know that it really depends on the typeface and the licence agreement. What do
  I need to look for to see if i can use a type in my product line?\r\n\r\nAm I looking
  to far into this? should I just use whatever type I want or am I right to try and
  look into what I can and can't use?\r\nI just dont want to put a typeface in my
  product line if i am going to get sued for using the typeface. there is a lot of
  grey area in this.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "First of all -in the US- font designs are not protected by copyright. Digital
    fonts do enjoy copyright protection over the actual data they contain, and a small
    number of fonts are protected by a <em>design patent</em>, but technically -if
    not ethically- you can make a knock-off of almost any existing design.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing is, you don't need to worry about any of that if you're simply using a font*:
    you would purchase a license to use it, and that's that. It's only if you're making
    a font of your own based on an existing one (or if you're redistributing somebody
    else's font) that you have to worry about legal/ethical issues.\r\n\r\n* There
    are some exceptions however, in that some font houses require extra payment for
    certain uses.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "There is no difference between a Bodoni and, say, Minion, because they are
    both (in their digital versions) recent fonts created by specific designers. It
    doesn't matter that one of them is directly based on a previous font and one isn't.
    Which is to say, if you are talking about digital fonts, none of them are \"rather
    old typefaces.\"\r\n\r\nAs Hrant says, typefaces are not copyrightable in the
    US, but you do need to buy a license from the type foundry in order to use them.
    With some exceptions, that single license is all you need to use the font on any
    product, unless the type itself is really the relevant part of what you are selling
    (like decorative pillows with monograms in a certain typeface). In cases like
    that, some foundries will need extra compensation, because their font is essentially
    the only notable attribute of your product.\r\n\r\nBut no one is going to sue
    you for using a font, as long as you obey the foundry's EULA."

    is royalty free, but just the \u201Cdesign\u201D. Digital fonts based on the design
    are not, neither is original lead type or lead type based on the original design
    by their physical nature."

    There shouldn''t be any grey area: the EULA is a legal document.'
