It now looks like I may be in such a position so I wanted to ask for some details on others' experiences at such events (I know, that&rsquo;s a very general question). I have the web-links for each organization to get details on future dates/places, etc., but I&rsquo;m just curious to hear about what these conferences &ldquo;look like&rdquo; through the eyes of a few Typophiles.</p>
<p>Also, are there other such conferences I might not know about?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At the moment (three weeks into the teaching year, with a handful of freelance design jobs  on the go as well) the thought of putting a presentation together is <em>far</em> to much to think about, but these things are a ways off, so who knows. I&rsquo;m serving as one of three judges for this year&rsquo;s Alcuin Awards (Canada&rsquo;s national book design competition) and may be giving a short presentation then, so perhaps it might be worked into something more substantial. Again, who knows. But thanks for the push.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hope this topic doesn&rsquo;t dry up right away, as I&rsquo;m quite curious to hear about the two biggies and any other conferences that a book designer / typographer might venture away from the isolated studio to visit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have attended every TypeCon except the very first. [Full disclosure: I am now on the SoTA board.] I&rsquo;ve also attended two ATypI conferences (and gave a presentation at one of those).</p>
<p>Jason, the conventional wisdom about the two is that TypeCon is more informal, more general, and tends to attract a wider spectrum of attendees, from type industry professionals to graphic designers and newbies; whereas ATypI is generally held to be more professional, more focused on industry-specific interests, and more international in scope and flavor.</p>
<p>I know many colleagues who attend both, each for different reasons (i.e., to satiate different needs ;-). I also know some who prefer to attend only one over the other (in almost equal measure).</p>
<p>In my experience, TypeCon tends to feel more social. There&rsquo;s a great blend of type makers and type users, and the atmosphere is very conducive to finding yourself in conversation with your biggest idols (or greatest fans). It&rsquo;s not unlike the Typophile General Discussions or Design forums in real life.</p>
<p>I have less experience with the ATypI conference, but it tends to feel more professional. There&rsquo;s a greater representation of European type makers. There are many more presentations and a lot of tough choices. (ATypI is multi-track, whereas TypeCon is single track.) ATypI feels a bit more like the Typophile Build forum.</p>
<p>I tend to view TypeCon as a great place to expand my type connections, and ATypI as a good place to advance my type career.</p>

<p>I suppose because a font company hosts it and no-one else is allowed/invited to contribute(<A HREF="http://www.typo-berlin.de/index.php/Sponsors;67/3">?</A>) it&rsquo;s hard to come up with interesting conspiracy theories - &ldquo;they only gave him that award because *** **** ****** is like a MAJOR sponsor&rdquo; ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I attended my first TypeCon this year. With the exception of a panel discussion on grunge typography (which seemed to be a rehash of the material of previous presenters), I found something of interest in every session. As has been previously mentioned, the range of topics and approaches was broad, but I found that appealing. Type history, type in pop culture, type design, typographers of the moment (both today and in past centuries) &ndash; it really was a rich experience.</p>
<p>Being a longtime (if not exactly prolific) Typophile participant made it easy to find people to talk to. It was fun to walk up to someone whose name I recognized from the forums and introduce myself. Of course, I met lots of other folks with whom I didn&rsquo;t have any previous connection &ndash; the shared love of type made it simple to find common conversational ground.</p>
