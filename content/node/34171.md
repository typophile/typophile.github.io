  have an upper duplex apartment, possibly of interest to type-inclined folk, available
  for July 1. \r\n\r\nThe attractions: good light, small front office room, balcony,
  entirely renovated last summer, close to downtown Montreal on a street with a bike
  path. \r\n\r\nThe downside: Living above us (two sometimes-adults, two children,
  two dogs, two motorcycles).\r\n\r\nContact me for the details or delete the post
  if I'm totally violating the rules. (And if so, I beg forgiveness and understanding
  in advance.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nK."

    a problem with the kids, the dogs, the adults, or the motorcycles. \r\n\r\nI just
    gotta find a job. Something that honors the typography. But not bilingually. (Can
    I bring my cowboy boots?)\r\n\r\nAnd how close are you to the Atwater market??
    That's a fine fine place."

    \ the chi-chi new condo village that has developed near there. We're just the
