body: Hello, as the subject implies, I&#39;m hoping to get some ideas for a clear,
  bold face for use on a PDA application I&#39;m cooking up.  <BR> <BR>The ideal font
  would be fairly narrow, generously tall, and of ample weight. I&#39;m looking for
  something that fits a lot of characters on a short line but can be read clearly
  from an arm&#39;s length.  <BR> <BR>Here <a href="http://www.heavy-meta.com/fonts.jpg">is
  a screenshot</a> of the leading contender - &#39;Standard,&#39; one of the minml
  fonts. You can see the environmental contraints of the application from that shot
  pretty well.  <BR> <BR>Any ideas? Thank you.  <BR> <BR>Ian

  body: I think that size is too small to do anything interesting &#40;while remaining
    readable&#41;, so standard whatever is probably your best bet. <BR> <BR>hhp
