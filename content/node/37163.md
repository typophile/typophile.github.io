    without images. One would hope they at least had art in the paper version of the
    article.\r\n\r\nAlso, H&FJ's PR feats: magical."

  body: 'Yes, the lack of images is sad. I can''t find it in today''s Washington Post
    printed edition, so it seems to be kind of a neglected child, shifted to the web.
    On the AP site I couldn''t see any images either. I  would think that the author''s
    version had images. '

    thanks for posting this in the first place. We're really thrilled that the AP
    captured the team effort that is type design, and couldn't be happier than to
    see it in the service of one of our favorite organizations."

    seeing awesome Renaissance letters brought to life with digital precision. I need
    to stop trying to do it before I blow my whole senior year on a handful of letters
    by Hondius. \r\n\r\nHave these letters been publicly tested somewhere? Because
    I know that I have seen them somewhere quite recently, but I am not sure if someone
    else was using the same reference material."
