  body: When I saw that quote, a big bell rang in my mind. ITC used that quote (and
    what follows) for the sample text in all their specimen books. I never knew where
    it originated before now.

  body: "Here's a bit more of it (from an ITC specimen book):\r\n\r\n\"Excellence
    in typography is the result of nothing more than an attitude. Its appeal comes
    from the understanding used in its planning; the designer must care. In contemporary
    advertising the perfect integration of design elements of demands unorthodox typography.
    It may require the use of compact spacing, minus leading, unusual sizes and weights;
    whatever is needed to improve appearance and impact. Stating specific principles
    or guides on the subject of typography is difficult because the principle applying
    to one job may not fit the next. No two jobs are identical even though the same...\"\r\n\r\nSorry.
    There's no more in the specimen I have at hand."

    just that those words sound like something that might have written by Burns."
