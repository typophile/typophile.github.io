  to help me out.\r\n\r\nI'm designing a website for a University and have been looking
  at Typekit for webfonts.  I've tried out loads of the fonts and particularly like
  Proxima Nova, mainly for the cleanness, legibility and the fact that it renders
  well on Windows (the vast majority of our users).  I've been trying to pair it with
  a serif for headings, looking at x-heights, similar ascenders/descenders, counters,
  \ but I'm having real difficulties finding one that sits well. Bembo is used in
  some of our printed material and logo - not really an option for web and I don't
  think it will go with PN- but I'm looking for something with that similar feel -
  serious, academic, elegant.\r\n\r\nSome of the ones I've tried:\r\n\r\nFF Tisa -
  matches well but feels too slabby, especially at larger sizes for headings\r\nKepler
  -  I think this has the right 'feel' but not sure how well it sits with Proxima\r\nUtopia
  - Again, perhaps right feel but x-heights don't feel right\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any suggestions? Wondering whether to instead find the right serif for headings
  and then work back and find a different sans to match? Apart from inexperience is
  there another reason why it is hard to find a serif to match proxima, is it too
  geometric? \r\n\r\nAny help or pointers much appreciated!\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nBen"
