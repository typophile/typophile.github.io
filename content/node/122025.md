  body: "Ian Brignell's \"You\" is an outstanding implementation of the narcissistic
    Zeitgeist of the Selfie era. Big overblown strokes with pulled in ascenders and
    descenders, lush curves and a lightly brushed semi-serif treatment that barely
    enters the world outside the self.\r\nUnfortunately not available to the public
    as a font.\r\nSo, I wonder what could be substituted, or easily converted to a
    similar Selfie style?\r\nDon"
