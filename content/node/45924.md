  find two fonts:\r\n\r\n(1) the classy script from which swashes have been taken
  to make the super-swash\r\n\r\n(2) the \"AMERICAN\" serif; through the pixelation
  it looks like one of the Fleischmann revivals, but who knows (you know!)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, everyone\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_5646.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-4_4915.jpg]"
