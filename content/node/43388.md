  been photographed. I am building my portfolio and I am tying to decided the best
  way to display my editorial spreads. Did you do this in photoshop? Does anyone know
  of any tutorials available? It is more than just a drop shadow and it really looks
  great.\r\n\r\nI attached examples\r\n\r\nThanks"
