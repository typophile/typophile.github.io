  body: "Cute, but for some people who read Cyrillic a Faux Russian with Cyrillic
    letters substituted directly for the wrong Roman letters is a painful mish-mash.\r\nBut
    I do like the artwork. A charming children's storybook style that evokes the beloved
    family characters of Tolstoy's War and Peace.\r\nDon"

    anybody know which Cyrillic font (if any) these glyphs are taken from?"

    (France - 1965), Vodka and Wine (UK - 1966), Ru\xDFland wie es klingt und swingt
    (Germany - 1967), Russian Souvenirs (Holland - 1969) were more dignified; only
    in the United States was <em>faux</em> Cyrillic resorted to."

  body: "US version of the sleeve may reflect the inclination of Americans to mock
    Russia in 1965, which was smack dab in the middle of the Cold War. \r\n\r\nNick,
    is there an illustration credit on that sleeve anywhere? That art looks like the
    work of Seymour Chwast."

  body: "As for the Faux Russian letters, there is some pretty similar stuff in the
    Cyrillic glyphs of Parachute's Bodoni http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bodoni/bodoni/glyphs.html
    and New Standard http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/new-standard/pt-new-standard/glyphs.html
    The latter was widely used in Russian language publications churned out by Moscow
    during the 1950s and 196o's and would almost certainly have been seen by a lettering
    artist of the era researching how to do a Faux Cyrillic. \r\nDon"

  body: I thought the fine printing on the lower left of the label might name the
    artist, but a closer look tells me it begins "Mercury Records Corp. 35 E. Wacker
    Drive, Chicago Ill." with some assistance from Google, and ends "Printed in U.S.A.",
    perhaps just after a dash.

  body: "It\u2019s very sophisticated. \r\nEvery character appears to be drawn from
    scratch, none taken from an exisiting font.\r\nI wonder what the rest of the alphabet
    would look like?!"

  body: I'd say that it's considerably more likely to be Heinz Edelmann than Seymour
    Chwast; but I think that this particular style of illustration was used by many
    artists in that period, so I would not be confident of it being Heinz Edelmann.

  body: The several phi and A letters are identical (I 'fused' pairs visually as in
    stereoscopic imaging, and the slightest difference would have immediately shown).
    A possibility is that they were concocted using parts of letters and decorative
    elements from a Letraset transfer sheet which had their heyday in the sixties.
