    though, what are those caps? Got any idea?"

  body: "The H might be from Belwe italic too, but the F looks a bit improvised and
    somewhat crudely drawn. If I had to guess I would say [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/nuptial-script/|Nuptial
    Script]] was used as a rough model for the F, but it was elongated for design
    reasons.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you, Mike. \r\nI wish that it were Nuptial, but the loop at the top
    and at the bottom don't look the same even if they were elongated. Also, the cross
    on the \"F\" looks so different. I have tried and  tried to find them. I went
    through every one of the cursive and script on myfonts. Don't know what to do.
    Wish I could contact the designer. If you have any other ideas, please let me
    know. Thank you again."

  body: "I was not suggesting that they modified the Nuptial F, but that the F had
    been hand-drawn using Nuptial as a model. I doubt you will find this in a font,
    unless it's an amateur 'freebie'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I've been at the end of my rope looking for that "F" and haven't found it.
    Thank you for saying what I already thought... that it's not out there. What a
    disappointment. You've been so nice to take your time to try to help, and I appreciate
    it so much.
