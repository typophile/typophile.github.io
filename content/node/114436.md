  one, but Typophile is probably a better place to ask this question.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for a type or pair of types for a book, so it should be legible for larger portions
  of text. The book contains ancient Buddhist sutta text (in English) interspersed
  with commentary and explanations. The books has a very shallow structure, only chapter
  headings. The sutta text and commentary should be distinguished.\r\n\r\nOriginally
  I thought Caslon for the sutta text because it's an old and legible type, but it
  may be too heavy? The reading experience should flow and feel airy and comfortable.
  Then I looked for a good pairing, hence this post :-)\r\n\r\nIf you look at the
  original post, there are a few type proposals. But I am curious to hear the opinions
  of the community here? Thanks!"

  body: "The commentary should be readable too.\r\n\r\nSince Times Roman is so ubiquitous,
    it might be felt to show a lack of respect. Century Expanded and Baskerville are
    possible choices for the commentary.\r\n\r\nFor the text, Garamond or Bembo are
    old and legible, and more appealing to the modern reader than Caslon.\r\n\r\nCaslon
    was, at one time, the standard for text, the way Times Roman is now, but unless
    you carefully choose the right Caslon, you could run badly astray. Acceptable
    Caslons for modern-day body text work include: Williams Caslon, Imprint, and even
    Adobe Caslon.\r\n\r\nThese, though, are just very general suggestions, in terms
    of common fonts you might have handy.\r\n\r\nFor the text, if I were going to
    indulge myself, I might go with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/nicolas-jenson-sg/|Nicolas
    Jenson SG]] (or [[http://www.identifont.com/show?73R|here]]) which is a revival
    of Eusebius by Ludlow, one of the most accurate revivals of the original Jenson
    type.\r\n\r\nTo go with that for commentary, I'd be tempted to be really radical,
    and go with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-706/|Bitstream's News
    706]], the currently available version of the newspaper face Aurora. If you want
    sans-serif, Univers is good for body copy, but I'd encourage you to consider Optima
    instead. Or just be less radical, and go with Century Schoolbook.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is Palatino. As long as the text and commentary are different in point
    size, that it isn't distinctive enough from Nicolas Jenson SG to be mixed with
    it in some ways shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nPalatino for the text and Century
    Schoolbook for the commentary is another possibility for the kind of look I'm
    thinking of.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, looking at some Google Web Fonts that I
    liked recently, one could use [[https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rosarivo|Rosarivo]]
    for the text and [[http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Asul|Asul]] for the commentary."

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions! I quite like the Nicolas Jenson SG type, it
    has a hint of old-style, almost medieval to it which might make it a good candidate
    for the old sutta text. On the other hand, the News 706 suggestion is great, it
    looks wonderfully round and soft and, due to the large x height, airy. Unfortunately
    there's no \"light\" version of it.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try a Jenson SG Medium
    with a News 706 Light Italic.\r\n\r\nGood idea about Google fonts, I'll poke around
    there as well. The only challenge I had in the past when working with old sutta
    text are P\u0101\u1E37i specific characters with diacritics. Often times, the
    font I try doesn't provide for all the letters that I need..."

  body: "If one wishes to make an optimum aesthetic choice of typefaces for the English
    translation of the text itself, and the English-language commentary... one might
    have to resign oneself to using a different font for the translated text and the
    original P\u0101\u1E37i text, since the number of fonts giving comprehensive coverage
    of that language is likely to be limited, and their support of the Latin alphabet
    may also be an afterthought.\r\n\r\nBut this should be obvious common sense, so
    I suppose I've just misunderstood your intentions from your post. Hopefully there
    will be enough of a choice of adequate P\u0101\u1E37i fonts to allow that part
    of the document to also fit in with your vision (I'd choose the P\u0101\u1E37i
    font first, so that suitable typefaces for the rest of the document could be chosen
    that would also harmonize with it).\r\n\r\nI've noticed that one of the fonts
    is missing from the site given above, so one can also try [[http://www.buddhanet.net/ftp_pali.htm|this
    site]], which also has a face resembling Palatino with P\u0101\u1E37i characters.\r\n\r\nI
    can't seem to see any P\u0101\u1E37i characters in those fonts in Character Map,
    however. Here are some other recommendations:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ebmp.org/p_dwnlds.php]]\r\n\r\nOdd,
    [[http://www.budsas.org/fonts/index.htm|this one]], also highly recommended for
    typesetting P\u0101\u1E37i, is specifically for <em>romanized</em> P\u0101\u1E37i.
    Perhaps another misunderstanding on my part.\r\n\r\nAh; like Sanskrit, P\u0101\u1E37i
    is often recorded in whatever Indic script is used locally, even if external scholarly
    translations standardize on Devanagari for Sanskrit. Maybe you need to Google
    for a <em>Sinhala</em> font with P\u0101\u1E37i support (or support for conjunct
    characters, needed for both P\u0101\u1E37i and Sanskrit) if your project was as
    I understood it after the language was mentioned...\r\n\r\n[[http://awake.kiev.ua/dhamma/tipitaka/fonts/index.html]]\r\n\r\nHere
    you are. Download before Russian tanks create connection problems. (Actually,
    while they have a Sinhala font, their P\u0101\u1E37i font is also for Latin transliteration.)\r\n\r\nAccording
    to this page,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.virtualvinodh.com/sinhala]]\r\n\r\nthough, only
    one font, a commercial Mac font, offers extensive conjunct support for the Sinhalese
    script."

    is very independent from the Roman), and also very well with Evert Bloemsma's

    few retail typefaces support Latin transcription of Indic typefaces, but I take
    great interest in antique and small languages, and make sure they are supported
    in my typefaces. The support is out-of-the-box, by use of the Unicode Extended
    Additional block, and not combining diacritics (though the typeface supports them
    too). "

    P\u0101\u1E37i]], the TeX Gyre fonts as well as some other common open-source
    fonts have the necessary diacritic characters for P\u0101\u1E37i, but that still
    leaves you with a limited choice, and so going to Monokrom - apparently all their
    typefaces support an extensive collection of Latin alphabetic characters, but
    their page only lists native language support, not transliteration support - could
    well be a very good idea."

  body: "Thank you for your opinions and all the links! :-)\r\n\r\nTo clarify: all
    the text is in English language, the sutta translations are in English as well
    as the commentary explanations of them. Both, sutta text and commentary are mixed,
    depending on wherever comments are required within the English translation of
    the sutta text.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to the difficulty of translating some of the
    original words from P\u0101\u1E37i to English <em>and</em> keeping their original
    meaning within the translated English context, some of the P\u0101\u1E37i terms
    are literal; they are then explained in the commentary following a P\u0101\u1E37i
    passage. For example, \"ta\u1E47h\u0101\" or \"sam\u0101dhi\" or \"prat\u012Btyasamutp\u0101da\"
    \ are such terms.\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for now is a type (or two, if paired)
    that is legible and fitting to the subject. <strong>Quadibloc</strong> made a
    nice suggestion in the initial post.\r\n\r\nWhat I have not quite figured out
    yet is if I should us one type and use a medium/bold for sutta text and normal/italic/light
    for the commentary text, or should two separate but paired types be used. In the
    end, everything needs to be comfortable and convey a notion of softness and lightness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sindre</strong>:
    Thanks for the Satyr link, it does look nice and there's a light Legato, it seems."

  body: Well, Goudy Bookletter 1911, an open-source version of Kennerley... since
    it is open-source, you could add the diacritics yourself and redistribute the
    result. It has a code page issue that interferes with using it with WordPad, so
    you could fix that too while you're at it.
