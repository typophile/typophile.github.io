  body: "by \"written\", do you mean analog-style, ink-on-paper calligraphy?\r\n\r\nI'm
    inclined to believe it's from a vector source, whether an existing font or something
    modified. It's printed on a t-shirt, so it's heavily distorted. i think the consistency
    of the letters is impossible to determine from this image.\r\n\r\nThat said, it
    was done by <a href=\"http://blog.myfonts.com/blog/2009/8/5/freshjive-shirts-by-john-downer.html\">John
    Downer</a>.\r\n\r\nSo it's definitely possible.\r\n\r\n"
