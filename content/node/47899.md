  client.  My client sends me a lot of work and I gave her a great rate.  But now
  the end client is requesting the complete layout design in its original format so
  that \"we can make changes to the file as needed\".  \r\n\r\nIs anyone else releasing
  the layout design as part of the job?  Please advise."

    your client. Not with your client clients.\r\n\r\nBut what are things worth to
    you?\r\nDo you want to put a good relationship on the line? I guess not.\r\n\r\nNext
    time you probably take this into account.\r\n\r\nFor now it is a personal question
    I guess.\r\n\r\nOff course, they do have to pay for it since you were paid for
    making the designs. Not for giving them the files as well. \r\n\r\nJust thinking
    of something: I'm not certain about the laws in your country (I live in The Netherlands),
    but it could be you are NOT the author of your designs at all! By taking the job
    it could be that your immediate client has become the author (with all the rights)
    of your work.\r\nIn that case you stand empty handed, my friend. \r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    asking, but she passed it on to me and advised her end client to discuss it with
    me directly.  \r\n\r\nI will hold my ground on this.  I just was not sure if others
    were giving up layouts as the end client insists that they have it done all the
    time.  I still have my great client to work with and the job was already paid
    for.  It appears that this end client has had other crazy requests to vendors
    on this project, and are getting resistance from them all.  \r\n\r\nThanks again."

    confirm the sub-client is insane, put an insane price on the files - \"Like a

    I'm willing to make an exception for you for only $X,XXX.\"  "

  body: "Providing source files is fine, it's what you would call a template file,
    though you need to be clear on what the purpose of the template it to be used
    for and factor that into the cost or supplying the client with the files.\r\n\r\nYou
    can more or lease state exactly what is meant by template file and its usages
    as well.\r\n\r\nIdeally to be clear on handing over files form the start is to
    have a contract of some type stating that the work they are receiving is the end
    product, a pdf file for print etc and if they want the working files then an arrangement
    needs to sorted."

    to a different agency and ask for all their design files. Design files are technically
    owned by the client, who has bought and paid for them.\r\n\r\nIn your case, your
    client has another client who has asked for the files. And your client has agreed
    to release them. Be courteous. Be helpful. Let your client know you are being
    courteous and helpful.\r\n\r\nDon't release fonts or software apps used to build
    the files: they aren't licenced to your client's client."

    don't wanna pay for small changes or they will hire another advertising agency
    (another designer in your case). Although it's a small possibility, they could
    also do this for backup purposes. \r\n\r\nIf you give them what they paid for,
    there is a possibility to work with them again. Not a chance if you do not."

    not to mention that it could potentially become a huge hassle for you, the designer,
    to have to deal with a series of small changes to those files in the future (depending
    on your workload, this could be a good thing or a bad thing). It is best to give
    the source files to the client."

    and send the cd over (with charge for time, courier etc). Its all about a relationship.
    I don't understand what the issue is. \r\n\r\nThird parties often request them
    too, (for DAM systems or whatever) again, we just send them over - even the interactive
    team send their FLA source files."

    different things in different situations:\r\n\r\n- Hate the client, but I know
    they have money: put a ridiculous price on the files.\r\n\r\n- Hate the client,
    but they don't have money, and I don't want to do annoying changes for them: Just
    hand over the files, and wipe my hands. Or if really hate them, don't hand over
    anything.\r\n\r\n- Love the client, and I know they have money: Depending on how
    much work they send you, either just hand over the files or put a small fee on
    the files, so they know your files have a value.\r\n\r\n- Love the client, but
    I know they don't have money: Just hand them over.\r\n"

    clients who misunderstand the fee they are actually paying for is the design services.
    I have a similar approach to Josh (FeeltheKern) when it comes to handing over
    files. And honestly, if your clients don't respect the services you are providing,
    or appreciate their ultimate value, then it's probably not a relationship you
    want to continue.
