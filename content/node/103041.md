body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThere is a logo I'm working on and now I've been struggling to find
  a typeface that would nicely complement it. I thought that I could perform some
  crowdsourcing here on Typophile. I can't show the logo now but the attached image
  sums it up pretty well. It's geometric, modern, rounded, drawn on a grid but at
  the same time looks like made with a flat calligraphic brush.\r\n\r\nI must say
  that so far only Museo looks like a good match but I'm slightly put off by the fact
  its free and ubiquitous. If nothing better is found I might fall back to it, however.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nKey words to consider: contemporary, community, traditional values.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-shape_3865.png]"
