  body: "Not bad for a sophomore. While currently not being bad, I'd recommend continuing
    to develop an eye for color theory and typography. This mostly comes from simple
    practice and a closer attention to how others work with it.\r\n\r\nThe layout
    of the site isn't the most exciting thing I've seen. It gets the job done.\r\n\r\nWhen
    loading the Times essay, I couldn't close the lightbox. This would be VERY annoying
    to a prospective employer.\r\n\r\nThe line length on the blog is too long.\r\n\r\nThe
    work as a whole is OK, but nothing all that interesting. The most interesting
    was a color study.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a very good effort for a sophomore. Definitely better than what I
    had. Things to work on:\r\n\u2022 Reconsider the way you use space with the logo/menu/clickable
    images. Right now these three items are not integrated, and do not integrate with
    the presentations below. Consider how it will work once you expand to sixteen
    pieces, or with an odd number of pieces.\r\n\u2022\_Keep your photography style
    consistent. Do not photograph your work against a dark color unless you have to
    do it to get a shot.\r\n\u2022 Don\u2019t use Flash for the image zooms. It\u2019s
    unnecessary, irritating, and feels disconnected from the rest of the site.\r\n\u2022
    Make the image zooms work. Do not put links in a web site just because you\u2019ll
    make them work later.\r\n\u2022 Use bigger images and set up slideshows instead
    of having a collection of little postage-stamp images. Do not use Flash for this.\r\n\u2022
    Target this site at higher resolutions\u2014not many designers are reviewing portfolios
    at 800x600. \r\n\u2022 Your resume needs proofreading. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t
    put my GPA on a resume unless it gets above a 3.0."
