  the logo I might use Proxima Nova. Which text\r\ntypeface would you pair it with,
  to use in resumes,\r\npromotional material, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n\r\nPatty"

    media, not print.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be best to get an idea of how the logo
    will look to suggest a typeface, instead of just randomly pairing together fonts."
