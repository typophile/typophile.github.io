Blackletter faces are basically script faces. Whatever happens, more of less, where the penstroke starts and ends is just more or less ductus, not a serif.
I’d call the highlighted appendages – eh – appendages maybe?

Script????  It is just as painstaking and precise as the Roman. Hence Textura Prescisus. It is not a copperplate or spencerian, a flowing form. 

"where the penstroke starts and ends is just more or less ductus, not a serif."

No... ductus is direction and sequence. Has nothing to do with the existence or lack of serifs.

I hope for your sake that you don’t mean this seriously.

It’s obviously a blackletter.
It doesn’t have serifs.
So blackletter faces can’t be classified as serif typefaces.

What you call serifs in blackletter is something that accidentally (I don’t mean this in a negative way) happens when writing with a broad nip pen. That’s what I meant with ductus. It can be exagerated for an ornamental effect but it isn’t an essential part of the concept of a blackletter face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Remaining slightly off-topic: Jan, I think that the prevailing view nowadays is that in fact the serifs of the imperial Roman letter come not from the necessities of stone-carving but from the stroke of the brush. I'm certainly no expert in this area, but I believe the idea originates with (or was popularized by) Father Edward Catich's book <em><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Origin-Serif-Brush-Writing-Letters/dp/0962974013/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256964826&sr=1-1>The origin of the serif</a></em>; Catich argues that the serif follows logically from the brush-stroke that was used to lay down the original lettering, which was then cut in stone with a chisel. One example I can find that may be of interest (though it doesn't explicitly confirm Catich's thesis) is Sumner Stone's <a href=http://stonetypefoundry.com/Resources/Pre-serif%20letter%20excerpt%208..pdf>"Transitions in the form of the pre-serif letter."</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The renaissance was about overcoming the dark age. The designation says it all: renaissance = revival. Revival of the spirit of the past Roman culture. Part of that revival was replacing the blackletter letterforms with the Roman letterforms. The only examples of roman letterforms that had survived the dark age were those carved in stone. The first Roman typefaces (Venetian style) were more or less the Roman capitals with a lowercase added. Why or for what reason the Romans added serifs to their letters is not as important in this context as the fact (imo) that the venetian typefaces had serifs that were modeled after those carved in stone.

I have no clue where you are getting your info but Blackletter was only one of many concurrent written styles. And written forms never disappeared in the dark ages.

Look beyond "type" which is something many cannot seem to do. Calligraphy kept, and keeps, developing while type in its vast array of processes moves forward also.

Edit: serifs never went away!!!!!!

Serif or Sans?

David, thank you for your intervention... but this is a battle I am well prepared for after decades of lettering/calligraphic experience as well as research.

I think Jan's sense of history begins with the advent of type and he has no clue what went on before that or the calligraphic developments that have ensued along side of the printing/type industry since the 42 line bible.

But he is good at identifying type and chastising others for not using a descriptive in the type id forum.

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the books of Harry Carter and Noordzij, among others, I think Michael is pretty much on target. Even though the forms of blackletter and roman are different the histories are related and intertwined, and I don't think you are going to be able to make a case that one has serifs and one does not. 

I'm sure others will be more accurate about this, but basically it is the designs that are different, not whether there are deliberate cross strokes or not. Those triangles at the bottom of black letter n etc are cross strokes. The key design difference of blackletter is, as the term "fraktur" indicates, that instead of round archs and circles of roman, there are broken straight lines. 

Historically, the serifs in Carolingian miniscule and in later Blackletter are, from what I read, both historically and mechanically related. And they all go back to various roman hands in antiquity, such as the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustic_capitals|Rustic capitals]], which also have serifs. The humanist hand, in which the Carolingian minuscule was revived and paired with the Imperial Capitals was, according to Stone's account, the immediate ancestors of the first Roman typefaces. In this 15th century revival serifs were made more symmetrical in the lower case, to pair better with the ancient Imperial Capitals.

Btw, the question 'does blackletter have serifs or not?' is relativated by Noordzij's Ruit (including its name) whose feet are halfway between 'serif' and 'ductus'. In light of this, ironically, Jan Erdmann's textur sample of 28 October is much closer to having 'serifs' than your sample of the same day because in the former, the (imaginary) backward-movement of the pen is more excessive and creates a symmetry we would expect from baseline serifs. Also, it seems common to give stems marked endings in writing, irrespective of style. In textur this is very emphatic (Jan Erdmann's 'ductus') but has no other purpose than have curved endings or what we commonly consider as serif. Tapering of stems e.g. in Beorcana, since Florian brought it up, fulfills the same task. Whether one <em>calls</em> each of them 'serifs' or not is almost secondary.
And another btw, I consider serifs as too arbitrary to be relevant for type classification, construction and contrast being more important criteria.</div>

It just keeps getting more stupid.

"Jan Erdmann’s textur sample of 28 October is much closer to having ’serifs’ than your sample of the same day because in the former, the (imaginary) backward-movement of the pen is more excessive and creates a symmetry we would expect from baseline serifs"

And this one gets the Putz prize. If you think it is a backward motion it just points out what I have said before. Sometimes practice (knowledge by practice, your words) of writing would prevent one from making a statement like that! 

P.s. Jan's e.g. was type (if I am not mistaken or I would bet, you can see the letterpress marks)... the red was writ.

And you have to remember... as good as they were, the "cutters" of that time were not as fastidious about maintaining the original forms. It's tougher to get the hairline serifs in cuts. Expediency pure and simple. Oft times less articulate than the written form.

Edit: to the above contributor... there is a HUGE difference between a spur and a serif, and a terminal is a very generic term compared to the other two.

Generic is kinda the point. My point is that the terminology wasn't standardized when these pen strokes were made. I'm not suggesting that what I use to describe these "grey area" strokes be canonized in any way. But we can't classify every pen stroke. And I think there's nothing wrong with that. I kind of see it as a moot point. </div>
