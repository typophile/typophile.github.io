  at one, if another set of eyes could look at it and point out any flaws that would
  be great. Larger screenshot is attached. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: "I think it's coming along nicely, Matthew! A couple of things to consider:\r\n\r\n-
    there are some inconsistencies with your stroke weights, particularly in your
    thin strokes, such as the branching of the /m/ and the bottom branching of the
    /a/ and /d/ which need to be much thinner\r\n\r\n- a bit too much space in the
    counter of the /s/? Overall, that form doesn't carry as much weight as the other
    letters either, thicken it up a bit\r\n\r\n- the exit stroke of the /d/ could
    be a bit shorter as well\r\n\r\n- the crossbar of the /H/ and the adjoining top
    right loop seem to be different widths as well"
