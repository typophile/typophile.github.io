  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey there Typophiles!
I&rsquo;ve been interested in type for some years now but never really tried myself at this discipline.</p>
<p>I recently started thinking about a simple sans-serif font, based on my natural way of drawing letters. So I opened a [[http://typetip.tumblr.com/|Tumblr]] to document my creation process and share some studies on well known sans-serif fonts (mainly Helvetica, Futura and Century Gothic). What you&rsquo;ll find now is pictures of some of my very first drafts and visual studies of those fonts (comparing sizes, angles and so on, trying to understand their logic). And hopefully you&rsquo;ll find in some weeks/months/years a final OTF file for you to download.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s [[http://typetip.tumblr.com/|the site]]!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well aware that this kind of process can be long and hard so I don&rsquo;t really know where I&rsquo;ll end, but for now I feel enthusiastic and am looking for feedback if you have some!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It seems you mean it :-)</p>
<p>Besides studying typefaces like Helvetica or Futura it might be worth exploring a Bembo or Garamond the same way, or even the engraved lettering of some [[http://mediendesignkurs.de/Projekte/Schriftgeschichte/kapitale.gif|old Roman inscription]].</p>
<p>Wondering why I recommend those? 
Observe e.g. the <em>skeleton</em> of the classical Roman R with your pencil, and then compare it to the skeleton of Helvetica’s or Futura’s R. 
– Then you’ll probably see why.</p>

Thanks for your suggestion!</p>
<p>At first I thought I should only give a serious look at sans-serif typefaces because mine will most likely look like one of them; but I get your point and I can now see the benefit of also studying serif ones! Of course I&rsquo;ll be more interested in their skeleton (as you call it) than in their serifs and ornaments.</p>
<p>By the way, if anyone has essential resources for the absolute beginner, I&rsquo;m interested!</p>

<p>Quentin: FORGET about the „construction of letters“. F O R G E T T  i t ! !</p>
<p>This idea is but a long-lasting misunderstanding, imposed by the constructivist’s mind upon a matter he doesn’t understand. All those pretty Pacioli- and Dürer-drawings of Latin capitals, getting their serifs tickeld by tiny little Bauhaus circles – are plain kitsch. Nice to look at, but silly.</p>
<p>A letter is not a construct. Let’s get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>A letter is a <cite>written shape</cite>. It is a graph, and a graph in the true sense is the trail of a tool’s movement (a pen, a brush). The origin of all letters of all writing systems is the moving human hand. A letter by its very nature is the result of a hand’s physical movement, its characteristic rendering dependant of tool and material. It is not the result of any construction process.</p>
<p>One may compare (!) an A to a triangle and an O to a circle. But that is not to establish a kind of equation.</p>

I was referencing those studies as historical antecedents to what Quentin is trying to do, and any type designer do: trying to shape letters. Brushes, compasses, chisels, Bézier curves, all are tools which have dictated the shapes of letters, and still do.</div>

Frank, your suggestion is a great one! I&rsquo;m new to Tumblr so I had to find a way to enable comments. That&rsquo;s now done, thanks to Disqus. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop your reactions!</p>
<p>Riccardo+Andreas: I&rsquo;ll probably look at Feliciano, Pacioli and Dürer&rsquo;s works (which I didn&rsquo;t know), but I&rsquo;ll try to focus on my first idea which is keeping close to my initial and natural draft and trying to fit it into what a major sans-serif font looks like.</p>
<p>For example my M&rsquo;s vertex didn&rsquo;t touch the baseline when I first drew it, but I noticed most of the sans-serif fonts have a baseline-touching vertex. So I sticked with my first draft but pushed the vertex a little further to make it look more &ldquo;regular&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope my approach makes sense!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I posted a comment! Here’s one in general: Century Gothic is IMO a rather poor “me-too” geometric inspired by Futura (particulary Twentieth Century) &amp; Avant Garde. If you are going to compare sans-serifs, I would rather pick a humanist. That way you can compare differences in grotesques (Helvetica), geometrics (Futura) and humanists (x). It might also be wise to consider a more pure grotesque like Akzidenz Grotesk. Helvetica is more of a neo grotesque (not a real classification per se, but a <em>humanistification</em> of the grotesque genre).</p>
<p>The most typical humanist sans serif I can think of is Frutiger.</p>

<p>On the Helvetica/Akzidenz Grotesk thing; I think I&rsquo;ll stick with Helvetica as it&rsquo;s really well-known and widely appreciated. Studying it can only lead me to something more efficient/popular.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Andreas your statements are very reactionary. I have learned plenty from both Helvetica and the constructed alphabets mentioned above. Even it is as simple as learning from shortcomings. There is plenty to observe in Helvetica, if you bother to look, it does not matter that it does not <em>please</em> you. Look at Akzidenz too, because it will tell you something about Helvetica, some nuance that escapes you until you really chase it down. If you are serious about designing alphabets you will look at <em>all</em> type/lettering with an open mind and will be continually reevaluating designs (including why they don&rsquo;t appeal to you or why they are problematic), else you are just repeating tropes.</p>
<p>In short you will learn more by looking at Helvetica than by not looking at it, so long as it doesn&rsquo;t beguile you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d look at the original drawings of Futura and Helvetica (or &ldquo;adaptation of drawings&rdquo;, Nick Shinn, if you pick up this thread ;-)) and not at the digital files. The digital outlines are full of red herrings - I mean about the placement of points and handles etc. The intention of the designer is much clearer in the drawings, if not as measurable.</p>

I had the same idea, to chart a design from start to finish, including everything that I learned along the way but I did not begin collating the material in the beginning. In hindsight it would have made for a painful website as my progress learning was slow. I think I might still do the same but retrospectively, and in print. I am looking forward to how you flesh out the archetype shapes you have drawn. Very different conclusions can be drawn from the same skeleton.</div>

<p>Maybe they are. I’m sorry.</p>
<p>As I recall the beginning of his conversation was:
<cite>…started thinking about a simple sans-serif font</cite></p>
<p>and I was only about to point at the fact that Helvetica is hardly the point to get started with when it comes to learning type. 
In type history, Helvetica is rather a termination. It has not become a model, which would mean that some kind of development departs from it subsequently. And I do think, especially when advising beginners, we should make it quite clear that ”Helvetica“ is not the prototype of typefaces, although some inherited practice of computer vendors of late seem to silently suggest just that.</p>
<p>Of course, the study of everything can be instructive. No doubt. But those who ask for basics to be known should by no means be left with weak end-of-age-products like Helvetica to look at.</p>

You will Love it, and learn a lot from it. Yo will start to see letters in an entire different way.</p>

<p>This is up to you really - working from hairlines helps in a small way as you fix the archetypal shape in your head, however drawing this shape with two contours, not one line, is quite a different experience. I personally work from a central line for my sans serif drawings but a lot of the Typophilers don&rsquo;t believe in it :-) Also this is not the same as a hairline - imagine the central line for a bold font - the bowls won&rsquo;t touch the baseline as they will in your hairline drawing.</p>

Yesterday I felt a bit down about the creative industry - that video was quite the antidote.</p>
<p>The Frutiger book you have posted is also a great reference. I&rsquo;m not so sure about the Kareng Cheng book though, sorry Hrant. My feeling about Designing Type is that it does little to explain all the measurements it provides - why is this stroke thinner, why is the u wider than the n etc.. I own this book and still look to it to see how different alphabets tackle various forms but I feel that it did not really help me to advance. Hrant, feel free to disagree and say why you think it is a useful book - after all, it&rsquo;s better that I get value out of a book I own! Reconcile me!</p>

I think I agree about the /G/ shape, will have to work on it a bit&hellip;</p>

<p>On a sidenote, Frode Bo Helland commented on the Tumblr and suggested &ldquo;Optical corrections, upstroke and downstroke widths, ink traps and joins, intersecting strokes and harmonizing both shapes and internal/external space&rdquo;. Not sure about the &ldquo;upstroke and downstroke widths&rdquo; thing, do sans-serif typefaces need that? What about ink traps, got tips?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Even in a monoline sans serif you usually need some variations in upstroke and downstroke. We are apparently hard geared to expect diagonal downstrokes to be sightly heavier. I don&rsquo;t know. It just looks wrong :) The bowl of P and R look like stretched D&rsquo;s, while B&rsquo;s bowls are more square. B has it&rsquo;s own problems: where the two bowls meet you need some thinning of the strokes. The point where the curve starts also needs some polishing. It has a telltale kink in both contours.</div>
