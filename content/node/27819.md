    also gets you pretty close, except that the optional splayed M and W vertices
    are pointed. The optional 'a' is single storey, and the 't' is certainly more
    like your sample than Futura's, although the bar is lower. The main differentce
    between Text and Display is the x-height. Your preference.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
