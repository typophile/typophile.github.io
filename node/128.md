body: hi.  <BR> <BR>when exporting a &#39;swf&#39; file, text and type settings &#40;type
  size, character and line spacing&#41; are often different from the ones previously
  setted in the original &#39;fla&#39; file.  <BR> <BR>i&#39;m using verdana with
  the &#39;use device fonts&#39; option enabled, so that i don&#39;t get anti-alias.
  but i&#39;m suspecting this might be the problem... <BR> <BR>any sugestions? <BR>would
  be really helpful. <BR>thanks!

  body: Is your problem that you&#39;re hoping your device font will be Verdana?  <BR>
    <BR>If so, device fonts map to whatever system font on the users system is of
    the same &#34;type&#34; &#40;serif, sans-serif or &#34;typewriter&#34;&#41;, according
    to the tech notes &#40;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/flashfonts.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/flashfonts.htm</a>&#41;
    these will be Arial on a PC and Helvetic on a Mac. <BR> <BR>If you want, you can
    embed Verdana and control its quality with actionscript. This will give you small,
    more readable, aliased text, but of course it will give you a bigger file. <BR>
    <BR>... or am I misinterpretting the problem?

  body: 'thanks for your help. <BR>i don&#39;t think you are misinterpretting the
    problem, what you said is very clear and in accordance with the link you have
    provided. <BR> <BR>but... what happens to type when i export the file is that
    those with &#39;device font&#39; enabled are not mapped to the default &#39;_sans&#39;
    or &#39;_serif&#39;. fonts remain the same, only without anti-alias. <BR> <BR>i
    hope this image can illustrate what i mean: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/10881.jpg"

  body: O.K., once again I hope I&#39;m getting the problem right. <BR> <BR>I think
    that &#34;device fonts&#34; is a fail-safe, so that if the machine doesn&#39;t
    have the specified font, it will still be displayed in the proper style. Could
    it be that you have all of those fonts loaded on your machine and therefore &#34;device
    fonts&#34; doesn&#39;t have to switch over to the default? Try turning off Baskerville
    and see what it looks like. <BR> <BR>The filesize should tell you whether or not
    the font is being embedded.

  body: 'the difference you&#39;re seeing is between the font being anti-aliased or
    not. Flash makes device fonts non-antialiased by default. I don&#39;t know if
    there is a way around it, but at least in the cases of arial and verdana, i much
    prefer the crispy pixels. '

  body: 'I think his problem was not a lack of understanding about aliased and anti-aliased
    text, but rather a concern that if a user didn&#39;t have a particular font loaded
    on their machine and if &#34;Use device fonts&#34; was selected, the font wouldn&#39;t
    be mapped to the proper device font &#40;i.e. Avenir mapped to _sans&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>A few tests I made seem to prove this true. <BR> <BR>Here is a screenshot
    of an .swf file using Avenir, with Avenir loaded on my system: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/11366.gif"
    alt="Avenir in system"> <BR> <BR>... and here is a shot of the same file after
    I turned off Avenir: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/11367.gif"
    alt="No Avenir in system"> <BR> <BR>Apparently it maps to _serif as a device font.
    Can&#39;t think of a solution at the moment, except that if you want to use a
    device font, just use the device font &#40;_sans in this case&#41;. <BR> <BR>~p'
