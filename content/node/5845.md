  <BR> <BR>I think this font is called &#34;Motter Ombra&#34; but I&#39;m not quite
  sure. If anyone can lead me to the right direction as to where to purchase this
  typeface or if someone can provide the correct name for this typeface, I would really
  appreciate it. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance!

  body: Yes Basit,  it is Motter Ombra, I have checked it in an old letraset catalog.  <BR>But
    as BJ said, I am afraid it is not digitized yet.

  body: Hey Ignacio, I was wondering if there are still places in Madrid where you
    can get the old Letraset/Mecanorma catalogues &#40;pre-computer days&#41;. When
    I moved to the US I made the mistake of giving mine away and now I regret it.
    <BR> <BR>Is the old Letraset store in Mayor 4 still there?

    So are  Motter Faktum,\_Motter Femina,\_Motter Ferrum and Motter Ornata. Soon
    available will be Motter Tektura and Motter Air. \r\nSee the link for details.
    Got a second email right now, where Siegmund Motter affirms that Luc de Groot
    was responsible for the digitization of Faktum, Ornata and Ferrum. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I seriously love Othmar Motter's display type. I suppose it looks "dated"
    by now, but the style and class of the letters is some of the most innovative
    I've seen (like the V's in Motter Ombra, seen above).
