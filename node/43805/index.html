		<div class="commentbody">The Hochuli (with Robin Kinross) book is still one of the best I've read. But Rich Hendel's is the best, followed closely by Bringhurst. I know that we don't normally think of <em>The Elements of Typographic Design</em> as a book design book, but there's a lot of practical advice in it for the book designer—things on page dimensions and proportions (Chapter 8, Shaping the Page) are of particular interest.

		<div class="commentbody">Patty raises a good point. There are at least two kinds of books on *book design*. One variety is a how-to, which in many ways is a set of rules you should follow, and perhaps a list of typefaces. The problem with this is there is no one set of rules even at a given time, and moreover, the rules change with both technology and fashion.

A second kind of design book chronicles more how designers think about their work, what they see as problems, and how these problems are resolved. The problem with this is you need some background before you have an understanding of what the process is about; before you can glean very much from them.

I'd put Robert Bringhurst's book in the first category, Rich Hendel's in the second. You should probably have both, Though I'd prefer Tschichold for a "rules" resource.

And depending on you perspective, there are also two kinds of book design, the cover and the interior. The two should perhaps relate, but the question is how much? In university press publishing, by in large the function of the jacket is viewed to be the same as that of a poster. That is an advertising function, and ephemeral. With obvious exceptions, the interior is suppose to be timeless (though that too is in some real ways an illusion).</div>

Depending on what sort of book you are designing. This is true of most Trade publishers - they even have separate departments to handle the covers and the interiors. But with the sort of books I do, illustrated books (which means a book that is illustrated throughout, whether with photography, graphics, or illustrations), the cover and interior are done together and relate strongly.</div>

There are also several sub-kinds of interior book design. The design considerations and parameters of a trade illustrated book (like Patty's bread-and-butter) are different than those of scholarly typographic (more like Charles' sort of thing). How-to and illustrated reference (of which I've done my share) are very different from poetry. Cookbooks are different from fiction. Gift books are a different breed from trade nonfiction. Etcetera, etcetera. 

It occurs to me that we frequently fall into the trap of contrasting book design & typography with other design genres (<em>"Please suggest a good font for books"</em>) as though books comprised a homogeneous monolith. Which of course they do not.
