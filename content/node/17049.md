    and features than TT or T1 fonts\".\r\nI can stick thousands of glyphs in a T1
    font, give each\r\nof them a different name, and extract them quite\r\nnicely
    in any PostScript document with the PostScript\r\nlanguage command \"glyphshow\".
    Hackers know this all too well,\r\nand Adobe people are certainly aware of it.\r\nTruetype
    fonts can have as many glyphs as OpenType fonts.\r\nMany full-bodied kanji and
    Chinese fonts live quite happily\r\nin truetype.\r\n\r\nAbout features: Truetype
    can add tables ad infinitum, just\r\nlike OpenType. I am not saying that this
    is a good thing--\r\nbut technically, the statement above is incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
    stop the rumors.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It is more accurate to say that OpenType fonts, because of the GSUB and GPOS
    layout options, are encouraging font developers to increase the number of glyphs
    in fonts. So against the average size of a typical font supporting a single 8-bit
    codepage and with somewhat less than 256 glyphs, many OpenType will be noticeably
    larger. Indeed, Nathan noticed it.\r\n\r\nA lot of pre-OT TrueType fonts, of course,
    already supported multiple codepages and had other size increasing features, but
    even in the TT format the vast majority of fonts from most foundries supported
    the same limited glyph sets as corresponding Type 1 versions of the same fonts.
    Yes, Type 1 fonts can contain a lot of glyphs, but few of them in fact did so,
    so people's perception of 'normal' size for fonts has been that they are quite
    small files, and the gathering flood of OpenType fonts is challenging that perception.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of clever people, especially in the TEX community, did many impressive things
    with Type 1 fonts, and sometimes pushed the boundaries of that format further
    than Adobe did themselves. But the typical Type 1 font that most users knew and
    perhaps loved -- and which I knew as a font developer and hated -- supported a
    single 8-bit codepage and had a correspondingly small glyph set and file size."

    I am not saying that this is a good thing\u2014\r\n>but technically, the statement
    above is incorrect.\r\n\r\nFor most type users, TrueType and Type 1 are conflicting
    \"basic\" font formats, the former usually found on Windows-running computers,
    and the latter on Macintosh OS computers. The advent of OpenType, as John Hudson
    notes, is less about format and more about functionality. OpenType fonts, after
    all, can be created/generated in either Compact Font Format (CFF) or TrueType-flavoured
    rendering systems.\r\n\r\nThis discussion and the links therefrom are a good primer:

  body: "Mike Duggan might be able to give a better explanation if he's around but
    a hinting function can ask the OS what rendering mode it's in and apply different
    hints depending on the mode, eg to bulk up a diagonal stroke under regular antialiasing.
    \r\n\r\nIt's little used these days, but in a more recent case the same font was
    used on a device that rendered to TV and to a regular monitor - in b/w mode the
    hints were used, but in TV mode (regular antialising in this case) the b/w hints
    would not be applied, giving the pure antialiased forms, undistorted by hints."

  body: 'at the time I did the hinting on Palatino Linotype I did do some hints for
    GS @ 14 point (19ppem) mostly if I remember correctly, to strengthen up some diagonals
    and improve some shapes in GS. Where the font was 1 pixel stems up to 17ppem we
    disable GS in the GASP, and hense we didnt do anything for those sizes in GS.
    This was just pre ClearType and it was actually my task to look into making the
    1pixel stem sizes look better in GS, but ClearType took over and I never did get
    to it. '
