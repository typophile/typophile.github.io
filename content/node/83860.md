  body: "This is a Caslon, based on the A, T, and g among others. Which one may take
    some more work, since this is one of the most widely used typefaces. If that edition
    of the book was printed before the 80s it's probably a metal type which may not
    have a digital version, although there are many digital Caslons too.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I think Berthold's Caslon Book is a lot like this. This is one of relatively
    few Caslons with a single serif C, but there are others, including Adobe Caslon.
    I think this C style is from the Old Style or oldface Caslons.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    It was printed in 2009, but it was printed letterpress, soooo...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.steidlville.com/books/1012-Jack-Kerouac-On-the-Road.html\r\n\r\nI
    think I should just drop $11,000.00 to study it in closer detail."
