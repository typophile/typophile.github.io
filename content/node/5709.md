body: Hi, im new here and just getting started in the the whole design thing. <BR>
  <BR>The company im working for has indesign cs on a pc. Seeing as im relitivly new
  to the scene i thaught i&#39;d get a proper manual for indy. The real world seies
  came highly recommended, but my question is is it relevant for the windows version
  of indy, or has it got lots of mac spesific things &#40;eg keyboard shortcuts, general
  interface&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: The Windows and Mac versions of InDesign are virtually identical, including
    keyboard shortcuts and all UI. The only differences are that Windows uses the
    Control key where Mac uses Command and so on. All the InDesign books I&#39;ve
    seen, including Real World InDesign &#40;RWI&#41;, are intended for use on both
    platforms. <BR> <BR>That being said, there are a few differences inherent in the
    platforms themselves. For instance, RWI makes reference to the fraction characters
    not being keyboard accessible, which is a Mac-specific issue. But these things
    are pretty rare in what&#39;s generally a cross-platform book. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR> <BR>T

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The whole mac vs pc thing has got my head spinning a bit, but
    knowing that its all similar on both platforms is a relief.
