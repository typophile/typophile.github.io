		<div class="commentbody">When I visited Prague I flew into Germany then took trains to cross into Austria* and the Czech Republic, and that was trivial. Flying straight in might be different, but I'm pretty sure you don't need a visa for a US passport. To be safe, ask ATypI. <BR> <BR>* Salzburg, Innsbruck, Salzkammergut and Vienna. BTW, who told you Vienna was so beautiful? I guess beauty is subjective, and if you like neoclassical stuff it certainly has the most impressive stuff in the world as far as that goes. But on my list there are very many cities (including Salzburg) that are much more beautiful. To me Vienna is very pretty. <BR> <BR>BTW, I might also hop over to Bratislava - it's very close. Krakow is a supposed to be a very beautiful city too*, although that's a few hours north of Prague. <BR> <BR>* From what Nathan and this Polish guy I know have told me. <BR> <BR>Honestly though, my recommedation would actually be to spend as much time as you can in Prague. Only Barcelona is better. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the info! I have been to Salzburg once, not nearly long enough, and it was easily the most beautiful city I've ever set foot in. After a 13-hour series of flights and preceding time totaling to over 24 hours without sleep, I landed in Salzburg, checked into my hotel in the early afternoon, then decided to walk around instead of crashing and messing up my sleep schedule for the whole trip. <BR> <BR>I bumbled and staggered up and down the street and noticed a path up the wooded mountain across the street from my hotel. I got on it and followed it wearily. About forty minutes later I reached the top, where someone had long ago cleverly erected a restaurant and Biergarten. If only all mountains were so equipped! <BR> <BR>So yes, so far Salzburg is my favorite city. Second would have to be Munich. Tons of people tell me Vienna is the most beautiful, but also expensive, and Prague has that part beat. But I speak zero Czech, so traveling alone is far less stressful in Vienna. I still have not yet made a firm decision about the Vienna part.</div>

First of all, there are very few, if any, such people. When I went to my first ATypI conference in 1998 (to Lyon), I was a very poor student &ndash; I lived in Lyon in a youth hostel. Of course, I was lucky to use the student discount. ATypI conferences are IMO worth saving money for it.  <BR> <BR>We have now a good deal with Czech Airlines (<a href="http://www.atypi.org/08_Prague/60_city/40_travel" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.atypi.org/08_Prague/60_city/40_travel">http://www.atypi.org/08_Prague/60_city/40_travel</a></a> ) while for people from European countries &ndash; most railway companies offer some sorts of discounts if you book in advance.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll second what Adam has said about ATypI conferences. ATypI grew out of a manufacturer's association, so it has always been more associated with the business side of type than other type clubs and conferences, and this is one of its strengths. And, yes, this means that the conference attracts professionals, but in no way is it limited to professionals. There are always a good number of students in attendance, as well as people who are just starting out in the business. <BR> <BR>ATypI Prague marks the 10th anniversary of Tiro Typeworks. When Ross and I saved our pennies, checked into a dodgy hotel in San Francisco's Chinatown, and attended our first ATypI in 1994, we had not completed our first typeface designs and didn't know anyone. We had an introduction to Dave Farey and Matthew Carter courtesy of Gerald Giampa, and that was it. One of the first people we met at the opening reception was Margaret Richardson, then editor of <i>U&amp;lc</i> and she and other people went out of their way to make us welcome and to introduce us to people like Gerard Unger, Sumner Stone and Petr van Blokland. It is something I remember with gratitude, and I always try to meet some new attendees, particularly type design students, at each conference and make sure that they are made as welcome as Ross and I were in 1994. <BR> <BR>I really encourage people not to stay away from ATypI because they're worried that it is elitist or only for professionals and experienced designers. Come to Prague, and if you find it hard to get talking to people, come and find me or Adam. We'll be happy to meet you, buy you a drink, and introduce you to some people.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll second all of that. <BR> <BR>I too will happily buy you a drink and introduce you to some other type nuts.  <BR> <BR>Also, just because somebody is a Big Name Type Designer or works for Famous Type Foundry doesn't mean they're unapproachable. Almost all of them are in this because they love type, and very few of their heads have swollen to the point where they're jerks or unapproachable. <BR> <BR>Actually, it's kind of funny; even most people who are relatively sharp-tongued online are mostly pretty mellow in person. <BR> <BR>So if you can afford it, and you love type, you should come out. Just be sure to introduce yourselves, okay? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

No Vienna this year. :-( But maybe I can make the most of Prague instead. It would be cool if we could hook up with some Czech-speaking type folks. I'm also keen to hang around the German-speaking quarter, if there still is one. Czech is such a sexy language, but too difficult for me to make use of at this point. There should be enough gorgeous public lettering and ironwork to keep me busy for three days. <BR> <BR>Dan&ndash;I'm glad to hear you can make it!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My ATypI experience echoes the positive notes of other posters. I offer one more story that may help swing any fence-sitters to come: every summer my typeface design students ask &quot;should we come to ATypI?&quot; (which for them takes place after a year of little income and considerable expenditure, and on the eve of trying to get back into the job market). Most of them manage to make the trek, even if it is halfway round the world. So far most have come back to me and said it was well worth it; and none complained that they misspent their time and money.  <BR>And, be sure that the gestures of welcome and hospitality mentined above have been very real, and in some cases substantial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Farking OY. <BR> <BR>I just got a hotel yesterday. Most of them are full. This one is $180 a night and about two miles from the Archa. The upside is that it's an Art Nouveau hotel across from the Powder Tower and the Castle, and there's two miles of nothing but gorgeous Altstadt between it and the conference venues. So perhaps I will actually <i>lose</i> weight at this ATypI. Is anyone else staying near the Castle?  <BR> <BR>BTW, my last post was a joke that seemed funny at the time. But there was no way to convey the joke-ness of it. Don't walk into a bookstore and say that. <BR> <BR>If someone else has a double room you're still interested in splitting, please contact me privately. I'd rather spend more money on specimens and less on hotels.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok here's a little info on Prague where i just took a holiday&hellip; Lock up well. You WILL get broken into if you fail to lock up properly. Alot of the time it'll be an inside job so don't bring too many valuables. I had an iPod, Camera, Cell Phone and lots of clothes nicked on me, as did the other people staying in our apartment. The police must be run by Chief Wigam! If you do get robbed and the value is less than 500 euros don't bother reporting it, you'll spend an entire day in the station and recieve a badly typed and flawed report for your troubles. <BR> <BR>BUT apart from that, Prague is a great city. The streets are safe at night, and attacks on persons are rare. The beer is cheap, and so is the food. Try Torino Milano's for a cheap good italian. Don't drink the Absynth unless you are prepared for the worst hangover you'll ever have in your life. If you do, don't be stupid enough to drink more than three, it'll kill you or at the least you'll end up in ER getting your belly pumped. The night life is great, but try avoid the Stag parties (they tend to go to the strip joints). And most of all, enjoy!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Don't drink the Absynth unless you are prepared for the worst hangover you'll ever have in your life.</i> <BR> <BR>I've had Czech absinthe, and the first thing to note is that it isn't remotely like a classic French absinthe of the belle epoque. So if you're tempted to capture that Moulin Rouge little green fairy moment, you'd be better off going <a href="http://www.bestabsinthe.com">HERE</a> than any bar in Prague.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well it was the Czech absinthe that turned me into a walking disaster. Imagine time slowed down. Bullet time Max Payne style. Then imagine the DT's for 13hours afterwards. Too easy to get alcohol poisioning from the stuff. If you wanna get rightly messed up, it's the man for the job. <BR> <BR>Try one, and when you regain your speech (it'll take about two mins) get sense and order a cool beer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I was staying in the New Town in an apartment we had rented for the week. This works out cheaper than a hotel. It was the 'Downtown' apartments (as they are refered to on the internet). If any is considering these I wouldn't advise it as someone over there must have a set of keys. But I also have heard numerous stories of rooms beign robbed in hotels also. This seems to be the biggest problem in Prague in terms of crime. And as I said earlier, the police don't want to know. Also, if you do get broken into and the police try to send you to a 'Forigners Police station' don't go&hellip; it doesn't exist! It turned out to be someones house!  <BR> <BR>I don't want to paint a negative image of Prague, it really is a great city. Just take extra precaution when locking up and you should be Ok.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We just got word that one of our comrades will not be able to make it to ATypI. This means we've got a roomshare available for someone who might be seeking accommodation. Tiffany Wardle, Jim Grieshaber, and myself will be staying at the lovely little Atlantic Hotel on Na Porici, just down the street from the Archa Theatre and minutes from Wenceslas Square, shopping, entertainment, and all kinds of fun touristy things. Great location close to the conference venue and in the center of things. <BR> <BR>Jimmy G has a double room and needs a cool roomie. Male or female, non-smoking (at least in the room), fun-loving type geek welcome. Room rate is $163 a night, so you'd be splitting that with Jim. <BR> <BR>Email me at tamye at typelife.com if you are interested or know someone who needs a place to stay. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.aaaahotels.com/detail.php?id=513" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.aaaahotels.com/detail.php?id=513">http://www.aaaahotels.com/detail.php?id=513</a></a></div>
