body: "To preface, this is my first post to the forum and I've done a fair amount
  of digging on the issue, but haven't found any solution to my question. Apologies
  in advance if it has been answered somewhere else. And I must say, that the community
  here has been extremely invaluable so far!\r\n\r\nI have designed Titling Alternates
  (labeled <code>titling</code> in OpenType Classes) for the Uppercase (<code>upcs</code>
  in OpenType Classes) glyphs in my font.\r\n\r\nFor this, my feature is as follows:\r\n\r\n<code>
  feature titl { sub @upcs by @titling; } titl; </code>\r\n\r\nI want to also vertically
  position the quotes (<code>quotes</code> in OpenType Classes) to match the height
  of the Titling Alternates when that feature is activated. Normally, this is done
  by creating duplicate glyphs and adjusting them manually, then calling to that respective
  OpenType Class. However, I want to avoid creating the duplicate glyphs. To do this,
  I've created a new feature for <code>case</code> and used something like:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
  case { pos @quotes <0 -100 0 0>; } case;</code>\r\n\r\nThis is working great, however
  I want to make everything accessible through the Titling Alternates Feature and
  it currently isn't since the quotes are set up in the <code>case</code> feature.\r\n\r\nMy
  immediate solution was to simply do something like this...\r\n\r\n<code>feature
  titl {\r\n  sub @upcs by @titling;\r\n  pos @quotes <0 -100 0 0>;\r\n} titl; </code>\r\n\r\n...but
  for some reason, it's compiling a duplicate feature of <code>titl</code> in my OpenType
  Feature Preview. And upon exporting the font for testing, the quotes position feature
  isn't working.\r\n\r\nI'm a novice type designer and somewhat new to OpenType coding
  and syntax so I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. Any ideas on how to properly set
  this up so it's accessible in the Titling Alternates Feature?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: FontLab 5 uses an old version of AFDKO that only compiles kern feature GPOS.
    You would probably need to compile the feature code directly in the font with
    AFDKO, or use one of the newer font tools that use the more recent AFDKO code
    (DTL OTMaster, Glyphs, RoboFont). Note that I've never tried combining GSUB and
    GPOS lookups in a single feature using any of these tools; I do all of my OpenType
    Layout work in VOLT.

  body: You probably see two titl features in FontLab because internally the feature
    is split into GPOS and GSUB.

  body: "Right\r\nI opened the font created in FontForge and now FontLab generated
    new font without errors. Font works fine in ID5.\r\nSo it looks that FL uses AFDKO
    2.5 syntax. [FL demo build 4868]\r\nBTW the idea of feature split between GSUB
    and GPOS is a bit strange, but who cares, it works."

  body: "I tried manually inserting the feature code Janek provided using RoboFont
    to test the idea, but it didn't seem to work as I had hoped (I'll caveat that
    by saying I'm probably doing something wrong).\r\n\r\nHowever, using FontLab 5,
    the feature (of combining GPOS and GSUB) works in the exported OTF as anticipated
    using ID CC, but the feature does not work in Illustrator CC (or CS6). The OTF
    is only utilizing the GSUB glyphs in AI.\r\n\r\nI understand that combining GPOS
    and GSUB into one feature is odd, but this is more of an experimental exercise.
    Right now, I'm happy with the results; however, I may just end up creating modified
    glyphs (repositioned), adding a class then using GSUB. This will probably produce
    the most predictable results among the design programs.\r\n\r\nThank you all for
    the great feedback!"
