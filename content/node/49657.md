body: "Greetings Fellow Font Designers!\r\n\r\nFor the last several years, there has
  been a growing and disturbing trend online, the unauthorized conversion of font
  designs being resold by individuals on eBay and at personal websites . . .\r\n\r\nI
  have spent a good deal of time contacting many of these folks to have my Font Diner
  fonts and fonts that the Font Bros represent removed since it directly infringes
  on the licensing restrictions which include no conversion or resale of derivative
  works . . .\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I have also taken time to research the process
  as well as what methods can be pursued to convert my faces to sell to these customers
  of whom 99% are Windows users and most female and over the age of 50. Additionally
  for those not in the know, 99% of the US embroidery industry exists in the southern
  United States; North Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Oklahoma, etc . . .\r\n\r\nI should
  back up a moment to educate font designers on the methods of font use in embroidery
  applications . . .\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no Adobe or Apple in the embroidery
  world but rather a disparate group of manufacturers, suppliers, individuals all
  home-rolling their own one-off unique solution and for as many embroidery machines
  as exist, there is a unique application and software for them.\r\n\r\nThere are
  two different types of Fonts for embroidery applications:\r\n\r\nScaleable Fonts
  - Just like we're familiar with, there is an ability to create a scaleable typeable
  font but it's unique to a specific application and cannot be converted to another
  application . . . So, it's always dependent on the application . . .\r\n\r\nExpanded
  Alphabets - What happened about 5 years ago is that folks so frustrated with the
  lack of variety began to simply digitize our fonts as explained above specific to
  an application, then they generated individual letterforms in specific sizes ranging
  from 1/2\" to 3\" tall and selling each collection of letters for $9-$29 each .
  . . While these aren't really fonts at all, a quick Google search will show it is
  99% of what is being sold . . .\r\n\r\nThe Expanded Alphabet letters work with 100%
  of all machines and are easily converted at size for size resolution but cannot
  be typed out but rather are assembled one letter at a time since each letter is
  basically like an eps image . . . Also, they are only scaleable about 40% either
  way before the stitches become too hard to work with . . .\r\n\r\nWhile there is
  software that will automatically generate embroidery font files from fonts, 100%
  of all the folks I've spoken with insist if it wasn't hand-digitized, it won't stitch
  properly and the end result will be poor quality . . . Also, without an embroidery
  machine ($2-$8k) to test these digitizations with, the work cannot just be done
  solely digitally without testing . . .\r\n\r\nSo, here lies the challenge . . .
  The proper way to convert fonts to offer these fonts for sale means that we'd either
  need to develop a free universal application that allows folks to set type in the
  application and generate fonts specific to this application, OR we'd need to learn
  how to hand digitize our fonts or hire digitizers to convert our fonts to suit a
  format that can generate a library of expanded letterforms that can then be sold
  . . .\r\n\r\nWhile my post may seem trivial, embroidery font folks are making THOUSANDS
  of dollars selling our font designs and this I know for a fact!\r\n\r\nEven by implementing
  additional licensing in our EULAs that restrict this act specifically, the fact
  is this is a growing market and without some unified sense of a solution, our works
  will continue to fill other folks pockets rather our own . . . And so, I'm making
  a call to arms to ask for you to give your thoughts and opinions about a potential
  solution to this issue . . .\r\n\r\nAt worst if we can become educated about the
  conversion process, we can then elect to convert our works, at best we can agree
  there is a suitable forum that can offer the services and support to make this work
  happen in a manner we can license it . . .\r\n\r\nThanks for your ear and I hope
  I'm no alone in my concern . . .\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"

    of disposable income: people willing to drop three grand on a sewing machine.
    It''s unlikely that most foundries will start producing their own fonts in these
    mysterious formats. The ideal situation would be a 3rd party; sort of MyEmbroideryFonts
    kind of deal. They''d handle the conversion/testing for various formats and font
    designers would keep a chunk.'

  body: "That seems to be what it logically is coming to Ray for me as well . . .\r\n\r\nAs
    you're quite correct, $3k at minimum for a stitch machine to test the work . .
    .\r\n\r\nFunny thing is, different than font designers as a community, they are
    all cut-throat since once a font is digitized, it's done so there is lots of vying
    for exclusivity of the digitizations . . .\r\n\r\nI'm currently talking with some
    folks to find out what sort of arrangement they have in mind . . . I will share
    it with the group . . .\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"
