  what typeface would best represent it.\r\nSome attributes to think about\u2026\r\n
  \      -Built in 1937\r\n       -American Design\r\n       -Bridge Style: Art Deco
  / Modern\r\n\r\nI am leaning towards:\r\n       -Broadway\r\n       -Gill Sans\r\n
  \      -Franklin Gothic\r\n       -Din \r\n       -Bank Gothic\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any thoughts. "
