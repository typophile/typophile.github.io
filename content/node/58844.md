body: "Hey everyone, I'm curious to see if anyone has seen or can identify the typeface
  seen on a brochure that came into our office today. It at first seems like a standard
  sans-serif, but the terminals are rounded in most cases, which threw me for a loop.
  The only type I could find in this face was uppercase.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\n-Josh"

  body: "For starters to main type is something in the style of Eric Gill (obviously
    it's not) and kinda looks like the type from the London Underground logo since
    Gill took part in designing it with Edward Johnston that's obvious ass well. The
    sub-type could be something German like din mittelschrift (it's not, but something
    like it). And about those rounded corners: designers who are making logo's modify
    typefaces a lot especially features like that to make the logo unique and different.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need more help let me know.\r\n\r\ngood luck,\r\nSidney"

  body: Thanks for the info guys. The only thing that makes me wonder if it really
    is a custom job is that there are so many different letterforms. I guess stranger
    things have happened!
