  body: The type for Air&#39;s &#39;10,000 hz legend&#39; album was designed by Mike
    Mills who also designed the cover, apprently the type was made into a font but
    has not been released <BR> <BR>The Kylie one is just a one off logo which was
    done by Farrow design who also do the Pet Shop Boys sleeves and were responsable
    for that Spirtualized pillbox cover.
