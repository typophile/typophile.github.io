  family, and in the italics I tend to remove almost all the vertical stems. What's
  the general rule here? Is there any reason why I should NOT do this?"

    for sure, but i removed the verticals from my Tierra Nueva Italic too, as there

    are removing the hints, but leaving the stems themselves, yes, this is a good
    idea and the general rule of hinting for anti-aliased output is to not hint anything
    you can't align to the pixel grid. "
