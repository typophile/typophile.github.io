  starting a new post here only because the previous one might be a bit confusing
  as I included my inspiration as well as a similar typeface along with my design.</em>\r\n\r\nI
  still have a lot to work out but could really use some Typophile-eyes to help me
  on the finer points. I'm sure there's a lot I am completely missing!\r\n\r\nAt the
  moment, aside from some very obvious bad widths and inconsistent heights here and
  there I'm not really liking the dollar glyph. It seems too organic somehow. I do
  like my take on the ampersand but maybe it could use a tweak or two?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  are there certain things to watch out for when making it bold(er)? I'm using FontLab
  and it seems to give me contrary advice at times, to what I think looks better.
  I created the 'regular' size in Illustrator--because I know it better--and worked
  from there.\r\n\r\nA side question would be: I am only getting left-side quotation
  marks to come up, how does the char map work with the keyboard?!\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any and all suggestions and criticisms.\r\n\r\n~Wanda[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dep_4998.mod.jpg]"

  body: "I'm strictly an amateur, but here are my initial thoughts: I like the basic
    weight very much. The exclamation point might be given some width at the bottom
    instead of tapering to a point.\r\n\r\nIn both bold weights, the curved portions
    of the M and N appear too heavy. While they may be mathematically correct, optically
    they're too dense.\r\n\r\nThe extra bold looks like it was produced mechanically.
    The small gaps in glyphs such as the '3' ,  'K',  'X', ampersand, and dollar sign,
    as well as the counters in the the B, 6, 8, and 9 appear disproportionately small.
    I personally prefer a more prominant tail on the Q, but that's just me.\r\n\r\nI
    certainly like the overall typeface, and like it much better than the previous
    version! Looking forward to seeing you continue its development.\r\n\r\n"
