  body: "The design is very much Dutch old school (1930s); given the release date,
    it's quite possible that the designer picked up the lettering from older, pre-digital
    sources.\r\n\r\nBTW, you can see several samples of Dutch Deco type here\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://home.planet.nl/~voogt053/DDT/DDT.htm"
