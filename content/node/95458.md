  It is a pretty crappy handwriting font, one you could find by the millions on freefont
  sites. It has no special features, no ligatures, nothing to make it stick out form
  all other handwriting fonts. More authentic would be to just write something yourself,
  it would be prettier too, and just as (il)legible. I mean, not to slag of using
  fonts for a good cause, and I understand the concept, but is this all you can come
  up with? Why not work with a typedesigner with an interest in the cause and work
  with him/her to create something that has actual typographic value. \r\n\r\nI don't
  see people buying it for these fonts, why should I not donate to this cause directly,
  and just leave the fonts to be? It's like the homeless guy selling ugly postcards,
  and I tend to give him some money, but tell him he can keep the cards for himself.
  I don't want to be unreasonable, but surely, if one wants to use the selling of
  fonts to raise funds and grab attention for a cause, it should at least be a decent
  quality font, right?"

    on the handwriting of the person/\uFB01gurehead symobolizing and humanizing the
    charity. They\u2019re looking for potential sponsors to make an empathic connection
    with the celebrity victim (that may seem a cycnical assessment, but this is after
    all money-raising marketing that uses emotional exploitation and sex appeal to
    compete with other worthy causes)."

  body: I still don't see how making a rather crappy handwriting font conversion (surely
    she did not write in italic, bold and bold italic...?) is helping the cause. The
    handwriting is pretty ordinary, so it would only work if you keep telling people
    it's this persons handwriting. Would people really do that? I understand the marketing
    perspective behind it all, but I don't think the people behind this understand
    the font market. Like I said, even for a handwriting conversion, this culd be
    so much better, as has been proven by many other fonts. Now if they would use
    it for printed materials or website of the charity it would perhaps make more
    sens, but selling it like this...?

    artfully dishevelled hairstyle.\r\nIt is not the kind of photo that would be used
    for an appointment notice, for instance.\r\nThe design of the banner ad is too
    \u201Cretail-ish\u201D for the seriousness of the subject matter; the outlined
    type and vignetted dropshadow on a pink background is way too tacky.\r\nSorry
    if this is insensitive, but this is a design forum.\r\nWould I be wrong if the
    ad works, the font sells, and money is raised for a charity?\r\nDoes the end justify
    the means?\r\n"

    of her brother as the type designer, and I apologize if I\u2019m being inconsiderate.\r\nYou\u2019re
    right Jeffrey, the type could have been better done, but frankly I don\u2019t
    think he could have produced the quality of design you\u2019d like to have seen,
    based on the fonts that he has published. I can understand that he would want
    to do this as his tribute to her, and make her look good in the banner ad, but
    he was probably too close to do his best creative direction and contract out design
    where necessary\u2014it happens in self-publishing, especially in the graphic
    design industry. I\u2019ve produced quite a few font promotions for myself that
    in retrospect would have been better if someone else had done them. Pro bono work,
    too, can often lack the rigor of what takes place in a more formal professional
    process.\r\n"

  body: "I think the design of it all is indeed not fitting for the serious subject,
    I'm not saying it should be looking like a gravestone, or something very depressive.
    But it should communicatea clear message, with fitting means, this tries to cater
    to the market, by imitation. Probably this has to do with, as Nick mentions, the
    self-publishing aspect of it. Probably he wanted to do it, and the association
    decided to go along with it (why not, it does no harm). But with more distance,
    reflection, better art direction and clear objectives, this could have been much
    stronger.\r\n\r\nAnother thought that came to me, is that it seems like the font-buying
    public seems big enough to release a font for charity. It sure has grown, but
    still, it seems to me to be rather a niche market, with the biggest buyers being
    the big corporations (multi-seat licensing etc), not individuals. Many individual
    designers still don't know one pays to use a font (trust me, I have seem many
    examples), so why would those that do buy fonts pay this kind of money, when there
    are so much better fonts around, at a lower price, or even for free. But obviously
    it says even more about the fact that making a font is really so easy, that everyone
    can do it.\r\n\r\nI believe that if they insisted to release the font in this
    state, they should have made it donation-wareat a pay-what you-want model, and
    present it on a seperate website, let all the world know about the backstory to
    get people to the site. I believe this would also make the whole thing more effective. "

    the fact that he wants to make the font. I just don't think that as a strategy
    to raise awareness and funds for a cause, this is done well, and that a lot more
    possibilities are there if one wants to go down this route.
