  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Yesterday I had my first ever portfolio presentation for a design agency. They absolutely tore me apart, but still wanted me to work with them. Interesting people:)

First and foremost they really didn't like that I had "designed the portfolio". They told me my work should be enough on it's own.
One of the designers had to fetch his glasses to read my captions.
They rolled their eyes over some of my work, and also told me the way I presented it was terrible. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Psychology. They want to seem as if they're putting you in your place. It sets an uncomfortable precedent for the future: they're right and you're wrong. They sound somewhat arrogant actually. No big news here. Most graphic designers -- and moreso with those in 'high' positions -- as well being conservative, insular and unimaginative, are drunk with self-importance.

did they say anything positive? how do you feel it went?

honestly, sometimes people say you havn't been creative enough with your folio presentation, and other times the contrary. it's a minefield. to quote larry david: you just can't leave your house.

I think a few difficult folio showings is good for the soul in the end.</div>

I love working in environments with strong critiques. Some people don't.

And, yea, make sure your type is readable and don't overdue the 'package'...let the contents of your portfolio do the talking.

"My presentation skills suck though. It’s something I need to practice more often."

Yea, even in the best design schools seem to fail on the whole 'car sales 101' type class. Graphic Design, as a business, is just as much about selling as it is designing.</div>

I'm in no position to judge, but it sounds like you at least part agree with them? Old and young, we're always in education, and if this feels right, why not? Could be a good idea to arrange a few more meetings if possible, and see how other companies feel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">re: some of the posts on another "junior designer" thread : http://typophile.com/node/42466

when i reviewed student portfolios every week (for three years) at mtv, i noticed strong trends in portfolio strength and weakness from certain schools. in the new york art school area, the portfolios from SVA were consistently better and cleaner and stronger than student presentations from any other area school. 

several of the SVA students mentioned that they were required to take courses in portfolio presentation. i wish more schools would emphasize this often overlooked and misunderstood skill.

in the professional arena one must present and sell as much as one must design.</div>

fyi, this is a chat style. it's like an aspect of my handwriting. i know how to set standard english. it may be all those myriad and arbitrary rules in the work context that prompt me to ease up and keep it casual in chat posts.

but i actually prefer the way this looks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">wow. you could have been me today. i went to a renowned design agency after they invited me for an interview and they basically said that my work was well-executed but lacked ideas. needless to mention the fact that the people interviewing me had neither read my CV nor looked at my work before. 

What a drag. I almost died.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think nick was joking ch! I hope so :-) Seriously though, for me language is there to be warped, neologised, parodied, poeticised, ignored and more. It's a toolbox, not a doctrine. We need convention to communicate, but there is a lot of room for manoeuvre. The crux lies in whether meaning is communicated and even then it's a minefield of variables.

sorry to hear that asen. I've had several similar experiences with small but excellent studios in london and I came out a burst balloon carrying a black folio case. Makes you stronger and gives you something to reflect on in the end.

I like [[http://bp0.blogger.com/_O5gwPnEbkL8/R8Igw-JtD2I/AAAAAAAAAqg/dNYITXbMnOo/s1600-h/thank_you.gif| this]]

reminds me of something [[http://www.moreducks.com/index.php?wid=2|I made years ago]] following an aborted attempt at getting a job.

		<div class="commentbody">thanks chipman. it's my own type. the whole thing is connected and rather than a linear gradient, the colour transforms along the direction of the line. I drew it all out on graph paper, noted the co-ordinates and added all that data to a script to draw the bugger. I think it was done in 2003 maybe 04.</div>

I've been on the hunt myself over the last little while. I seem to be finding that most people really like my work and give me very positive comments but don't call me back. Kinda like going out on a first date and not getting a look in at a second. I found myself a nice place to work, but the contract is only for one month.

As for proof reading: I found no one at all ever read my portfolio, infact I felt like a dick even having text in it. I talk my way through my whole portfolio explaining each and every piece of work. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would be interesting to do regional portfolio review surveys in the style of salary surveys. That way people new to an area can find out what flies well with the local firms and not walk into a Sacramento office with a portfolio of slick Photoshop work or an LA office with a portfolio full of serious magazine designs.</div>
