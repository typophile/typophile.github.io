    belief in the supernatural, I figured that the Flash Player checker had found
    out about an update being available the last time I had my computer on, but Adobe
    decided that messages to update one's copy of Flash are less likely to be ignored
    if they are presented when a computer is first booting up, rather than later on
    when one has already started doing work.\r\n\r\nSo it just declines to tell you
    about an update being available until later - and that later is often before the
    computer has again connected to the outside world."
