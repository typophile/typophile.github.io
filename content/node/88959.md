  the trends of the past year?\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how typical Shinntype
  is, but here\u2019s our retrospective:\r\n\r\nOur best-selling \u201Cnew\u2019 retail
  typeface was Bodoni Egyptian Pro, an upgrade to a face that had been selling steadily
  for over a decade. One of the reasons it did well was because it was e-mail marketed
  to those who had already licensed the \u201Clegacy\u201D version, and quite a few
  decided to upgrade. (New weights, features and language support had been added.)
  Also, the slab genre, which had become very popular in the previous decade (notably
  through the Clarendon revival, the success of Archer, and the influence of <em>The
  Guardian</em>), was still going strong.\r\n\r\nWe also had some good corporate sales
  of Beaufort (another face designed in the \u201990s).\r\n\r\nOur largest commissioned
  design was in the rounded sans category\u2014a genre, like slab, that has been popular
  for a while.\r\n\r\nWebfonts has emerged as a new market for us, but not huge. We
  expect it to grow, but it\u2019s hard to say by how much.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs our
  established catalog continues to perform, I decided to move away from developing
  large-family faces in generic styles, to making more novel display faces. \r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nWhat
  has been the experience of other foundries/type designers?"

    around the world the Grunge genre and the early 90s have now a revival for at
    least a year already. Does this trend spill over to the graphic design world?
    Did it impact your type sales if you have something in that category? Did you
    notice this trend?\r\nI hope I am not hijacking this thread, I just thought it
    would fit. \r\nbest"

  body: "Thanks for the post. I am very happy with the sales of display fonts, specifically
    Egyptian, Clarendon, most of the slab genre, etc. For me, this has been a good
    year and I hope that it will continue. So to answer your question, yes display
    fonts of the older sort, i.e., nineteenth century in origin have been good for
    me and if I see a trend in this direction, it certainly is in the slab genre,
    if evidence of this can be found at myfonts. I like to divide the type world into
    display and text. A few can make great or at least very good text faces but this
    is hard. If they are good they will find an audience, and some on myfonts and
    other places developed in the past year are quite good. The display genre is important
    because many designers, I think, are always looking for unusual display types,
    thus for example the development of very heavy slab or sans serif fonts. I also
    see a proliferation of calligraphic types, many quite good.\r\n\r\nI hope this
    is an adequate answer. Thanks Nick."

  body: Trends seem to come from customer needs.  It seems that display faces may
    have a shorter life span but a more current need for projects.  What I mean is,
    a display face may be used for fewer projects by its purchaser but there will
    be more need for options in the display area by that same user.

  body: "Sorry, I think you and Chris are thinking of Hammersmith Bridge, from where
    Cobden-Sanderson dumped the Doves Press type into the Thames. The association
    of St Mary's Putney doesn't have anything to do with type, but rather, in a way,
    with the Occupy movement. At least, that's the reason for starting my walk there.
    In 1647, the church was the site of the Putney Debates, where the Grandees and
    Levellers in the New Model Army debated the constitution of post-Civil War England.
    It is one of the great moments in radical history, when the notion of electoral
    suffrage independent of property were given voice, famously in the statement of
    Colonel Rainsborough:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For really I think that the poorest hee
    that is in England hath a life to live, as the greatest hee; and therefore truly,
    Sr, I think itt clear, that every Man that is to live under a Government ought
    first by his own Consent to put himself under that Government; and I do think
    that the poorest man in England is not at all bound in a strict sense to that
    Government that he hath not had a voice to put Himself under.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    figure a walk from one of the early sites of radical political history to the
    most recent, 365 years later, will have something of the flavour of a pilgrimage.
    Ironically, the route takes me up the King's Road and past Buckingham Palace.
    London's good at imposing historical significance."
