body: "Can anyone help me locate this rounded font? I've checked out many of the rounded
  fonts mentioned in other threads such as Gotham Rounded and Bryant. The closest
  match is DIN 17 SB (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/din-17-sb/regular)
  but the peak of the capital A in the image is more rounded and the font weight also
  seems lighter in the image version. Also, and apologies for the lack of correct
  terminology, if you compare the Y and A in the example image, the point where the
  upper sections of the Y meet is just above the crossbar of the A. In DIN 17 they
  are a greater distance apart which would make me assume this isn't DIN 17 SB but
  I can't find a closer match\r\n\r\nI thought I'd call on help from people with a
  keener typographic eye than myself. What do you think? Is it DIN 17 SB? Any other
  suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPE_4904.jpg]"

    a single Asian font. Here's a sample in Apple LiGothic, which ships with OS X,
    showing the difference between its single-byte and double-byte Roman:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/YAUATCHA_5154.png]\r\n"
