  body: "I think this may be hand-drawn. Despite it's overall uniformity, there are
    some minor inconsistencies (unless the backgrounds are messing with me), there
    are few to no kerning pairs to speak of, and the \"O\"s and \"U\"s do not extend
    past the baseline or the capheight.\r\n\r\nIt's likely based on some geometric
    that I don't recognize, but I can't help beyond that.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"
