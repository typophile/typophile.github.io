  body: "Louise Fili is best known for the innovative book jackets she designed for
    Knopf and Random House in the 1970s and 80s. Her typographic sense may have been
    influenced by Herb Lubalin, with whom she worked briefly in the 70s.\r\nSince
    1989, she has focused mainly on restaurant and food packaging design. The work
    in this photo has an eclectic style reminiscent of Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast's
    work at Push Pin Studios in the 1950s and 60s."
