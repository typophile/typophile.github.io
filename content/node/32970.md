body: "Hello Everyone\r\n\r\nYour comments and critique of this beer label that I've
  just sent to print would be most welcome...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FistralLabel01x600px_4027.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  could make any improvements after this initial short print run.\r\n\r\nThe label
  is to be printed PMS 3155 and metallic silver PMS 877. The dotted line is the die
  cut.\r\n\r\nThe 'Fistral' logotype font is a customised Hartwig Schrift and most
  of the other type is ATF Antique, plus a little Trade Gothic.\r\n\r\nI have asked
  the printers to change the barcode numbers font from Arial (please Lord, for the
  sake of the children, anything but Arial) to something more techy/utilitarian if
  possible.\r\n\r\nTo give you some context, Fistral beach is the UK's surfing capital
  and is on the international competion circuit. The brewery that makes the beer is
  just a few miles inland. This is the only label going on the bottle which is a standard
  330ml clear one and will have a silver crown cap. The beer itself is a pale gold.
  And chilled. Nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    awkward and the final l reads as an f to me. \r\n\r\nWill the bottle be clear,
    green, or brown?\r\n\r\nIt looks nice otherwise, but it might have been fun to
    make it even more RAD for the surf set."

  body: "I enjoy a beer now and then, and I must say I don't recall a color combination
    such as this. The overall design gave me the sense of a Belgian White.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Patty, reading Fistral was not my first impression, I actually thought
    it was a German word or something.\r\n\r\nEDIT: That doesn't mean I think you
    should change it, I've definitely seen a lot of difficult to read beer labels,
    which in itself is a unique quality of the label's design. Plus it gives the alcoholics
    something to enjoy while they're sitting there waiting for the buzz to start."

  body: "I share Patty\u2019s concern on the readability of the logo, especially glimpsed
    in a chiller cabinet over a bar, pertinent to the readability is the amount of
    logo visible when the label is wrapped around the bottle, even though most of
    the target audience will know the name from the beach. On the label I might centre
    on the bullet between Newquay \u2022 Cornwall, regardless that that would uncentre
    the type either side; and increase the size of the scroll in proportion to the
    trident lozenge and insert a comma after strong on the front.\r\n\r\nFor the volume
    I think you must show the e estimated symbol\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Estimated%22_sign\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: IIRC The OCR code is measured by stroke width and not height so you could
    shorten that a bit. (But do check this out with those in charge!) I shorten the
    codes on some book jackets I design.

  body: "I think it doesn't really matter which font is used for the numbers, as long
    as it's legible and fits in it's place. That's the part for the human eyes. But
    one musn't fiddle with the lines. If they are shortened, scaled or pasted inside,
    it has to be done so that the lines don't change in proportion to each other.\r\nI've
    changed the font to Gill Sans in the past (as it was used in the package anyway)
    with no problems reported.\r\nI use Barcode producer now, and it lets me change
    the number font, or it can be changed in Illustrator. The said application also
    warns me if the size of the code is too small.\r\n\r\nGood point about the colour,
    Patty. You don't want to be the favourite hate person of the cashiers, who have
    to type the code in every time."

    looked set in Hartwig Schrift before customising...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FistralHartwigSchriftx600_4976.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FistralLabel01x600px_4027.jpg]\r\n\r\nPatty
    and Tim, mmmmm, yes, I'm also not sure if my Fi ligature is as elegant and legible
    as it could be, but I'm pretty happy with the final l.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else
    think the overall readability or the Fi ligature and the final l are problematic?\r\n\r\nI
    had been thinking along the lines of Asvetic's comments, in that I wanted the
    design to have some continental quirkiness. And then I covered my as\u0455 by
    having 'Fistral Premium' further down the label.\r\n\r\nPatty, a RAD surfer design
    was considered, but it needs to appeal to the Newquay high end bar, restaurant
    and hotel market too, not just the doods on the beach. But, yes, it would of made
    for a more fun design job.\r\n\r\nThanks Tim. Astute and practical comments as
    usual. I think I agree with them all. I have been careful to allow for the bottle
    wraparound effect.\r\n\r\nThe client is checking the blue for acceptability with
    the Official Bureau of Barcodes.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the barcode is, unfortunately,
    out of my hands. Barcodes really screw up a design with limited space. It's about
    time technology advanced and they were replaced with some kind of micro digi dot.
    And a blue lazer.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Phase II, friendly & romantic.\"</em>\r\n\r\nAlessandro,
    I'm sorry, I'm not really sure what you mean, but I think I like the sound of
    it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like it general and the oceanic color scheme will work with redish colored
    glass or clear with a warm colored ale. If you choose to make the Letters more
    legible I would look at the t and maybe even consider a ligature. I know two ligatures
    next to each other might be odd... Also what about raising the height of the el
    'l' at the end for better visual balance? Actually raising the height of the F
    & the l together might be pretty awesome. And what about raising the position
    of the 'calligraphy' itself slightly. The text at the bottom looks slightly cramped
    and there is space above available I think. Not a huge adjustment though.

  body: "i did not struggle with the Fi, but did with the l.\r\nactually, i really
    like the typography. the earlier suggestion of centering the bullet is a good
    one, but i think the overall label is pretty strong typographically. the main
    thing that gives me pause is the green/silver combo on a white label. i'm just
    curious -- did you consider white and black on a silver (or maybe gold?) metallic
    stock?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FistralLabel_5120.jpg]"

    reversed type. Maybe the shield background is different than the band? There is
    too much white for my eyes, it looks unfinished to me, but still nice.
