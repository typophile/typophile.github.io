    night. Not sure if that's famous enough for you, though.

  body: "The use and abuse of Eurostile/Microgramma in science fiction is very well
    documented, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgramma_(typeface).\r\n\r\nIMHO
    <em>The Andromeda Strain</em> is the film where the face performs better, numbering
    endless corridors that add to the claustrophobia in some scenes. \r\n\r\nIf you
    are looking for less artistic uses, the regular weight version is used in the
    gauges of several cars. I have it in my Honda Civic and have no complaint (no
    complaints about the rest of the car either).\r\n"
