body: "In Quark 6.5, on Max OS 10.4.11, the bold weights of some fonts are not displaying
  correctly.\r\nThis issue is becoming too much to endure, and getting InDesign isn't
  an option.\r\nAny advice or suggestions are most appreciated.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/problem_3734.jpg]\r\nAs
  you can see, the bold version of the font doesn't seem to have its kerning info.
  I don't use the kerning table in Quark.\r\nThis is a PostScript Type1 font file.
  Only Quark seems to botch the kerning like this: Photoshop, etc. are fine.\r\n\r\nI've
  wiped the jaws folder, and that hasn't helped. This is how they appear in font lists.\r\n\r\nFont
  Book list:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontbooklist_3425.jpg]\r\n\r\nQuark
  list:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quarklist_6317.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs the ITC
  and DTC difference an issue? Or are Font Book and Quark merely looking at different
  things to get a name?\r\nIn my Google searches I found out that DTC=Digital Typeface
  Corp. and that it is now defunct. Font Book's Info pane confirms that it is from
  Digital Typeface Corp. Some other DTC fonts have this same behavior. Could I have
  bum font files?\r\n\r\nThe font doesn't appear to be corrupted though. No other
  applications display the type like this.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do to make
  Quark display this correctly? Thanks for the help."

  body: It appears that the bold weight is using the same metrics, width-wise, as
    the lightface. If these were PC Postscript fonts, I would say that the culprits
    were .afm files with the same name...

    .afm files.\r\n\r\nHere are the names of the actual font files:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/filelist_5695.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
    this where my problem exists? Should the file names be different?\r\nIs the bold
    weight getting its metric info from the Cheltenham-ITC.t1 file instead of the
    Cheltenham-ITC_bold.t1 file?\r\nWhy would Quark be the only thing messing this
    up?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help."
