  how to use Roman numerals with a script typeface was recently posted on Ask MetaFilter,
  and I'm curious to see what answers would be given by people at Typophile.\r\n\r\nI'm
  particularly interested in joeclark's statement \"You shouldn\u2019t be using a
  script typeface for any application that requires all-caps text.\"\r\nI would tend
  to think that Roman numerals aren't considered \"all-caps text\", but that they're
  something else entirely. What say you?"

    depends on the font, but I think it holds for most script fonts.\r\n\r\nIt may
    be a challenge for font creators: include All Caps variants of the capitals. That
    oughta work for roman numerals as well."
