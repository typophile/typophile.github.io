  about this logo, which I created for publishing company called WiR. It's completely
  imaginary company which produces books and e-books in two languages. My idea is
  that they have a special method where text flow from one language to the other.
  That's why I tried to connect all 3 letters. \"W\" and \"R\" are first letters of
  founders surnames and \"i\" is \"and\" in my language. What do you think?\r\n[logoWir.png]\r\n"

    proportions, and it caused problems in many situations. It was awkward in some
    layouts, and when reduced small the type was hard to read.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small-logo_6282.jpg]
