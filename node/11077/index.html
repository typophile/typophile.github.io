Gain certainly varies a lot, but interestingly for a common class of printing it seems to hover around 1 mil, and apparently this average hasn't changed much at least since Dwiggins's time (when he noted that is was 1 mil).  The other three parties I mentioned have all arrived at values of around 1 mil for typical gain, and it's very telling that they've done so independently. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) More than anybody I wish Jim would stop using you as a proxy. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) I am American mostly on paper.

I can accept that - making money in type design is hard enough without such idealism. And in fact there are certainly some wonderful fonts out there (past and present) which don't have trapping but nonethless deserve to be classified very highly on the scale of text faces.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I just made a composite for you: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The background is cropped from my metal scan from before, and overlaid on it is an actual print I've made from Pascal 60. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can see: there's no gain; the bodies are not solid. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I made that print (on good paper) because I wanted to repoduce the exact letterform outlines, for tracing - so I didn't care about having solid bodies. The point is, that's the only way I managed to avoid any gain (and I only managed that because I had a master printer holding my hand through the process). If I had wanted to make the bodies solid as well as maintaining letterform fidelity, I'd have had to be Gerald Lange myself. And there are very few of those. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So in real printing such ideal results almost never happen, basically because a non-solid body looks worse (to most people) than fattened outlines, and most printers will go &quot;Huh?&quot; if you mention something about the type designer's intentions&hellip; Like I've pointed out, even Bram de Does fattened Fleischmann's brisk foot serifs. Maybe he liked it that way, but it's anti-fidelity to the original. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The tendency is to go over, not under. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note also that when you're setting up, removing ink is a major pain (you have to start over), but adding is trivial. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there is generally too much ink and too much pressure, so there very much is gain. Not enough to justify the huge traps on the &quot;b&quot; (considering the large point size), but enough to justify the ones on the &quot;d&quot; for example. That &quot;b&quot; is in fact an exception in the overall font. Which makes me wonder, maybe the person putting in the traps (which would most probably not have been Mendoza y Almeida) was going alphabetically, overdid the &quot;b&quot; (and fixing it was decided against, since they might have had to make a new matrix), but then got it right for all the rest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for your point about Fleischmann's huge shears being a design decision, I can't deny that's a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->partial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> possibility (unlike people who apparently can deny that gain not only exists, but is the norm), but in the case of Yellow, I can be sure it was gain compensation, because I asked the guy. And why would Fleischmann not have followed the same mental path towards that design feature? I'd guess that contemporary phone book printing is comparable in gain to newspaper printing 250 years ago (and that's what that Fleischmann 8 point was made for). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Guessing as well. Bit of an oddity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In <em>Counterpunch</em> there is some discussion about the procedure for small text sizes that may have some relevance to Fleischmann. Small text sizes were not initially used in early printing as I recall and when introduced there was some concern about their legibility. I think that's in <em>Counterpunch</em>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I doubt very much trapping would have been a consideration in the stereotype process, where the flong was used.

		<div class="commentbody">Though, maybe you are on to something. Stereotypes were used for long extended runs, early on to save the original metal type (used for the initial casting) from wear. Commercial grade paper was at its lowest point in terms of quality by the mid nineteenth century and into the early twentieth, and perhaps in certain kinds of book work or for newspaper work, maybe trapping could have been a consideration. On the other hand this is a period of time (Industrial Revolution) where typographic concerns as we discern them today were somewhat non-existent, either forgotten or ignored.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I took some measurements off that Palatino. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) The baseline is higher in inverse proportion to point size. Strange. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) The scale, spacing and weight generally increase in inverse proportion to point size. Good. But the 18 is a direct scale of the 42 (bad); and the 12 and 8 seem to be direct scales as well, but I'm not sure. Also, the 30 seems to be an enlargement of the 42 (a little bad). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) The x-height/cap-height proportions seem constant.
