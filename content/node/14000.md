  target=\"_blank\">Helvetica Flair</a> yesterday, i asked myself if things like that
  are even legal - taking a letteshape, altering it (maybe better talk about \"extend
  it\") and using it again. please be aware, im not talking about selling it - just
  using it for personal or business matters.\r\n\r\nby the way, most of you will know
  it, but on typograpica, you can find a nice <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000852.php\"

  body: "it all depends on the foundry's [[EULA]]. Some allow for font alterations,
    some don't. Be sure to read the documentation that comes with your font license.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, some feel that once you license a typeface you should be able to alter it
    however you please, but I won't go there... you can find that discussion elsewhere
    on typophile."

    dilemmas, I deal with them later. \r\nI don't see a problem with modifying a typeface..
    adding curlys or whatever for a project. However, altering the typeface and then
    turning it around to sell as another typeface I might have a problem with.\r\n"

  body: "At my advanced age I learned a lesson. I was commissioned by an ad agency
    to alter a face for one of their clients' exclusive internal use. In my innocent
    ignorance I assumed that they (the client's client) had bought the use of the
    face for a number of work stations. Wrong. The people in the users' design pemrtment
    had apparantly not poaid for the font.\r\n\r\nMy embarrassment is greater because
    now I find it is not just OK to mess around with someone,s design whether you
    have paid for the use of the font or not, at least it's not that way acoross the
    board.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to take on that kind of work again, no matter how
    innocent it sounds. It's boring work anyway. Maybe they'll allow me to plug into
    this Forum from the bucket.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n"

  body: My observation, is that when you come across a typeface, whether already in
    print or digital, for a project ie., poster, logo (with rights procured) postcard,
    one might be bound to add or subtract for purpose to add a meassage, this is in
    the realm of acceptable. If your purpose is to redesign and distribute as altered
    face, this is unacceptable. Addition or subtraction can add a great deal in the
    visual sence. A designers comfortability with type is essential. I believe that
    stretching, scaling or obsuring a typeface's general being is morally unacceptable
    more than creating something new. By redrawing or deconstructing a letterform
    is to use a typeform naturally and extend the meaning or purpose for which it
    was initially designed.
