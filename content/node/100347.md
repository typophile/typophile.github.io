  body: "Thank you again.\r\nI read it was designed by Robert Wiebking in 1917 but
    what about the artistical leaning of the font.\r\nIs it influenced by Art Nouveau
    or by Art Deco in your opinion?"

    first use of the term Art Deco has been attributed to architect Le Corbusier who
    penned a series of articles in his journal <em>L'Esprit nouveau</em> under the
    headline <strong>1925 Expo: Arts D\xE9co</strong>. He was referring to the 1925
    Exposition Internationale des Arts D\xE9coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International
    Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts).</blockquote>"

      you consider John Schaedler's \"Tabasco\" in the same vein of Robert Wiebking's
      \"Advertisers Gothic\"?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/tabasco/\r\n\r\nHow
      do you differentiate Art Nouveau from its German counterpart known as Jugendstil
      in the context of typeface and Robert Wiebking in particular?"

  body: "No doubt the idea of curving the straight bits came from Art Nouveau, but
    it evolved into Art Deco, through the efforts of people like Wiebking.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the history of the Mennen brand, it adopted a version of this bendy style in
    the teens, and used it for the wordmark\u2014and still do!\u2014and in packaging
    and advertising typography in the teens and twenties.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/!BvRnOtg!Wk~$(KGrHqMOKjkEvOYsWMqGBMD5z53J3w~~_35_5728.JPG]\r\n\r\nAdvertiser's
    Gothic is a tour de force by Wiebking, in which he managed to successfully integrate
    three design themes\u2014curved straights, stencil, and vestigial descenders.\r\n\r\nAnother
    face from the same era, Poor Richard, has the similar stencil effect:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RedRooster-31299-s_3958.png]\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/poor-richard.aspx\r\nAlso
    stencil: Auriol.\r\nAlso very short descenders: Hobo.\r\n\r\nAll those styles,
    or parts thereof, were lettered in ads, posters and packaging before being made
    into type, and again, who knows where they originated? They may even be considered
    design by a cadre of lettering artists bouncing themes around. \u201CPoor Richard\u201D
    was hand lettered on many a silent movie intertitle.\r\n\r\nAlso in the same vein:
    Arts & Crafts lettering, e.g. by Rennie Macintosh and Dard Hunter (1908):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dardhunterbrainsweb_6551.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    doesn\u2019t do justice to Advertiser\u2019s Gothic to pigeon-hole it as in\uFB02uenced
    by Art Nouveau. All one can do is point out similarities\u2014who knows what went
    through Wiebking\u2019s head? Not even him, no doubt, and the only way he could
    \uFB01nd out was to draw and cut the face, and then see what it looked like. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it could be said that it was in\uFB02uenced by Art Deco from the future \u2014
    an emergent principle.\r\n"
