body: The dreaded upgrade is here and suddenly all my OS9 fonts are obsolete garbage.
  Adobe CS came with some nice fonts, but our shop needs so much more. <BR> <BR>On
  a lark, I downloaded Fontlab for OS X and opened a Type 1 font from OS 9. I exported
  it as OpenType, set some type with it in InDesign, made a PDF, opened it in Acrobat,
  preflighted it, and printed it to a Postscript Level 2 laser printer. Whoa. <BR>
  <BR>Did that really work? It can&#39;t be that easy. Can I batch-process 300 fonts
  to OpenType with Fontlab and keep production running smoothly? The boss would think
  I was god if I could pull that one off.

  body: Whoa, now! <BR> <BR>Why do think your OS 9 fonts are obsolete garbage? <BR>
    <BR>Type 1 fonts are perfectly compatible with OS X and Adobe&#39;s CS apps. Converting
    Type 1 directly to OpenType offers no advantages other than a single font file
    with OTF versus separate outline and screen font files with T1. I think you&#39;re
    wasting your time with the conversion unless your entire Type 1 library is pre-1990
    vintage and the bitmaps are still using FONT resources rather than NFNTs. <BR>
    <BR>Can you clarify why you think this is necessary?

  body: Jefferson <BR> <BR>There has been a long ongoing thread on this regard over
    at T-D &#40;Type-Design&#41;. It may be possible to convert a standard PS1 to
    OT but batch conversion is a bit problematic at this point, especially if you
    are trying to combine certain fonts, say a font that also has a separate Expert
    set. Besides the encoding problem, PS1 fonts don&#39;t share kerning pairs. <BR>
    <BR>While I do agree that conversion will become a necessity, simply because at
    some point down the type road Adobe and Microsoft apps are not likely to support
    PS1, at this point I really don&#39;t see how this can be effectively done in
    any form of batch process &#40;despite the proposed and much delayed FontLab TransTypePro&#41;.

  body: Grant, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried running the fonts in question on OS X, which
    largely refuses to recognize them. Even Classic mode only sees about 18 out of
    300. And Quark 4.1 only sees three of those in Classic mode. And it all crashes
    at the drop of a hat. For a number of reasons, we&#39;re moving to OS X and Creative
    Suite. <BR> <BR>Gerald, <BR> <BR>Thanks. I&#39;ll look for the thread you mentioned.
    I&#39;m not absolutely opposed to doing all this manually, but I have to convince
    the boss that it can be done - and done successfully - for x number of dollars.
    The cost of Fontlab is equal to the budget I have for fonts, so it&#39;s an intriguing
    proposition.

  body: Although there are a couple of other advantages to conversion &#40;much smaller
    file sizes, cross-platform fonts&#41;, it&#39;s hardly a necessity at this time.
    I say this despite being one of the most visible proponents of OpenType. <BR>

    think that there is something seriously wrong with the fonts. What foundries or
    suppliers are these faces from? If you&#39;re having that much dropoff in terms
    of OS 9 to OS X transitioning, I would be concerned that some of the face may
    not make the conversion intact anyway.'

  body: Thanks for moving the thread. I wanted to create it here, but couldn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR>Grant, <BR> <BR>The fonts are a bastard mix that came from multiple sources.
    Many came with our laser printer. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked at them all with FontLab
    demo, and it seems to be able to open about 3/4 of them, so I&#39;m going to recommend
    to the boss that he buy the full version. <BR> <BR>The nice thing about all this
    is that I&#39;ve long wanted to work up some typefaces of my own, but never had
    the appropriate tools to do it.

  body: And thanks, Justin. That is just what I wanted to hear. I think this conversion
    is doable, somehow. I hardly dared to dream it would be, but the whole project
    looks like a go. I&#39;m excited about it.

  body: 'I finally completed the process. Over 800 fonts in perhaps 140 families were
    converted manually to Open Type CFF. Mostly Type 1, and a few True Types. <BR>
    <BR>After conversion, I had to go back and redo the entire process: I had left
    out the Open Type naming fields, and the computer thought every font was &#34;regular.&#34;
    The names required manual correction in most cases. FontLab tended to call everything
    &#34;regular&#34; by default. Doh!-the time that wasted! Finally got it sorted
    out and am about to make a specimen book. If only OS X had a specimen book utility.
    <BR> <BR>I also created a few faked sloped fonts for romans that didn&#39;t have
    italics. &#40;Yes, shame on me.&#41; It&#39;s disturbingly easy to slant every
    glyph by x degrees with the push of a button'
