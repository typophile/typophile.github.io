    very close recently with no success. As suggested by Don, this is close to Copperplate
    but too many details remain off to me (serifs shape, none of the standard weights
    looks to match, overall design is far more balanced, stroke thickness more regular
    and consistent...). I can only confirm the feeling you have regarding Gotham.
    That really looks like it with some serifs added (which is a long process but
    not so hard).\r\nAlternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/biondi|Biondi]],
