body: What is the purpose of the lines sticking out of curves that one often sees
  in production drawings of letters? Are they there to make Ikarus digest the letters
  correctly?

  body: "If I understand the question correctly, it sounds like you've been looking
    at Ikarus production drawings. The little ticks are the locations of the intended
    points. If you're experienced with digitizing in Ikarus, you can put those marks
    on your drawings and expect good results from whoever digitizes them. \r\n\r\nI
    think Linotype or Monotype production drawings are sexier. "
