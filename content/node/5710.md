  nothing about the city. Can anyone suggest things to do/see &#40;other than drinking
  immense amounts of coffee!&#41;? Anything especially typographic going on?

    go to Weiner Neustadt to watch the Diving Ducks baseball... Weiner Neustadt is
    rubbish but we had a wicked time during baseball EuropaCup 2004... and I was told
    by Gerry Leonidas that his cousin in law was mad that we Richmond UK pounded his
    Greek team Aris Thessaloniki 16-0... just before the Greeks won the football Euro

  body: 'hmm, unsure about typographic, but i spent six months in Vienna at one point.
    <BR> <BR>Museums: the Belvedere &#40;includes Klimt&#39;s The Kiss and Schiele&#39;s
    The Embrace&#41; and the Kunsthistorisches Museum &#40;lots of Breughel are two
    of the world&#39;s best. But my personal favorite is the Secession House, a masterpiece
    of Jugendstil architecture which features the massive Beethoven Frieze by Klimt--
    this spans four walls and is Klimt&#39;s interpretation of Wagner&#39;s Interpretation
    of Beethoven&#39;s interpretation of a poem by Schiller, and absolutely stunning.
    after you see the Secession House, you&#39;re right next to the Naschmarkt, an
    open air market where you can get massive Doner kebabs &#40;like massive gyros,
    basically&#41; for dirt cheap. <BR> <BR>Being lazy: chilling out in the gardens
    of the Hofburg &#40;imperial palace&#41; when the sun is out. <BR> <BR>Kartner
    Strasse: the city&#39;s main street, make sure you check out the American Bar--
    don&#39;t let the name fool you-- this is a hundred year old masterpiece of design
    by Adolf Loos-- the bar only fits about 16 people, but every table, wall, and
    counter is impeccably concieved and crafted in this modernist style. you&#39;ll
    probably admire the type on the signs as well! The mandatory Big &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    Church, St Stephen&#39;s, is also on Kartner Strasse and worth going in.   <BR>
    <BR>food and drink: beer &#43; wienerschnitzel are excellent. there&#39;s also
    of bunch of wine gardens slightly outside the city but easily accessible on the
    metro. although it&#39;s a touristy thing, eating a Sacher Torte &#40;Vienna&#39;s
    most famous cake&#41; at the Hotel Sacher is really a great experience, with the
    right company. <BR> <BR>nightlife: the obvious answer is the Bermuda Triangle,
    an area with tons of bars, but really, anywhere you go will be fine. <BR> <BR>do
    you know what area you&#39;re staying in?'
