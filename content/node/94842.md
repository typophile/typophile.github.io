  ain't bad (sorry, I'm a big fan of wheat and meat), but I love this poster. By technical
  standards the handlettering isn't even very good (the <strong>s</strong>'s are particularly
  egregious). But the artist had a natural eye for good composition, and rendered
  the letterforms with a playful energy that invites you to read them, and softens
  the stern austerity of the message. "

    and process graphics was produced by skilled professionals, this is abysmally
    amateurish. Perhaps the real talent was busy on the assembly line, making weapons.

    G. Cooper, a predecessor and\u2014AFIK\u2014no relation. Letterer, illustrator
    and former Art Director for Life Magazine\u2014in case you're interested.\r\n\r\nThe
    other Nick\u2014and there are a lot of them\u2014does not quite \"get\" the FGC
    vibe. Okay. Strokes for folks. I even make allowances for Canadians: they are
    people, too.\r\n\r\nI get Fred. I like Fred. If you do to, check this out\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mrs-bathhurst/\r\n\r\nDundee
    Brewing Company liked the typeface so much, they have\u2014at least, in the past\u2014used
    the typeface for their beer bottle labels. Cool, retro and quite affordable.\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nYou do so? I do not recall saying \"do not\" unequivocally.
    I distinctly remember saying \"does not <em>quite</em>,\" which gives you some
    benefit of the doubt. Which, you being Canadian and all, you deserve. Which I
    mean in a good way. Canadians get multiculturalism, and celebrate diversity as
    a positive thing. Unlike Americans, who like everything homogenized and pasteurized.
    Why has worked out SOOO well, don't you think?\r\n\r\nAnother brief irony break
    here\u2026\r\n\r\nSo, Nickster: are we cool?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Leslie Cabarga did
    a book on Fred G. Cooper, which is well worth reading\u2026if you can get it cheap.
    Hand-drawn stuff, quite honestly, does vary in quality, but FGC was one wild and
    crazy guy\u2026once you get to know him."
