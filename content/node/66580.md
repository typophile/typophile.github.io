body: "I offer this challenge one more time: Strictly from memory, list the real name
  or usernames of three of this site\u2019s admins. \r\n\r\nNow write a couple of
  sentences documenting the personal background or merely the administrative approach
  of one admin. Do you know anything about them?\r\n\r\nNext, explain exactly how
  one would contact <em>any</em> admin or <em>a specific</em> admin. I mean exactly.\r\n\r\nAdmins
  need to be listed by full name and username, with a way to contact them. When one
  merely wishes to contact any admin, that has to be possible too."

  body: "There\u2019s a page that has a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/moderators\">list
    of the moderators</a>, with the possibility to contact one of them.\r\nI agree
    that, in order to offer a functional service, a link to that page \u2013 or another
    possibility of contacting them \u2013 should be present on every page.\r\nI also
    wish there was a way to contact <em>any</em> admin."

  body: Florian, your avatar on that page links not to you but to Paul Hunt. And Kent's
    links to Tiffany.

  body: I agree that some sort of moderator badge would be useful. Many forums put
    a star or some other icon next to the moderators' usernames, or they have a special
    avatar or custom title.

    a super admin. ;-)"

  body: "When offering my services as an Admin, I was explicit that I have no interest
    in being a Moderator. \r\n\r\nI have no problem with being a janitor and cleaning
    up the trash as I go along, but I am quite frankly not interested in fielding
    a barrage of messages from all and sundry. \r\n\r\nIf greater visibility becomes
    a requirement, then I will likely rethink my service.  \r\n\r\nI thought the short-lived
    flag feature was promising. I look forward to its reinstatement.  "
