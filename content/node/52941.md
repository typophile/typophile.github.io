  body: Thanks for the quick feedback, guys! It seems to be Spoleto or Opti Sport
    Script, but of which seem to elude the internet...

  body: "It was part of the Expresiv Ornate Font collection sold by Tiger Direct in
    the mid-1990's. NovelFonts was the foundry that made the collection, but as I
    noted in the thread Stephen linked, I don't think they are available any more.
    Mike F's note about Aktuelle from QBF was right, but it seems you can't puchase
    it from the site. I do have Opti Sport Script and Spoleto, if you want to see
    samples Mike.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
