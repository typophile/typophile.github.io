body: "So I am starting a project wherein the branding is surrounding a famous Catholic
  saint, Padre Pio. So my ideation has lead to creating a wordmark that emulates a
  Gutenberg style typeface but also has a very modern feel to it. Basically, I am
  looking for a font that very subtly implies a blackletter style without such hard
  strokes.\r\n\r\n...and yes I have looked at Fakir."

    I could see it if you were promoting Martin Luther...

    I guess I didn't think about the country that Pio had come from... which is a
    great point, although I am not sure if Italian typography really reflects Catholicism
    as a whole. I am trying to touch on more the more archaic roots of the religion,
    such as scribes and early printing press. I am thinking more of a Benedictine
    calligraphic style with a modern twist.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Padre Pio was
    too much into experimental Italian futurist type. \r\n\r\n; )\r\n"
