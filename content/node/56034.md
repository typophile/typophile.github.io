body: "I have been looking at some actual Aldine italics and while they are really
  cool/fun/etc I don't know that I would actually want to use them along side a Aldine
  roman in a book. There is just too much going on in them. \r\n\r\nSee for example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italic_5667.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/3130496314/\r\n\r\nI
  should also add that I don't think I have to use something obviously Aldine of Arrighi
  in style. However as am I about the get down to designing my first italic for a
  roman that is Aldine in inspiration and it occured to me to ask you all what sort
  of italic in your experience  is a good partner with an Aldine roman. And actually
  - what you think is a poor match as well if you like.\r\n\r\nI do know that there
  isn't one answer to this for a variety of reasons.  For instance : a good choice
  it will depend on how the italic is meant to be used - to set off a word or two
  or for longer passages. The other context is that I am interested in two contexts
  - screen use and for books.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I love Galliard. But Galliard Italic is so strong, that I can never use it.\r\n\r\nSo
    my vote is, whatever Galliard Italic ISN'T. Not that I don't think it's a good
    design, it's just too overpowering to use the more subtle Roman alongside it.
    I wish the italic was more subdued."

  body: "Like Robert Slimbach, I opt for a restrained, somewhat orthodox style with
    the main body of the x-height based on the classic chancery script. Having done
    a bit of calligraphy, I'm very comfortable with this approach; I can easily imagine
    making the strokes with a pen. I don't think there's much wrong with the structure
    of Aldine italic, it's just a bit rough!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/goodchild.html\">Goodchild</a>

  body: "Think about it this way: the Aldine roman is \u2018humanist book type v2.0\u2019.
    First there was the beta release made by Schweynheim and Pannartz at Rome, then
    v1.0 which was Jenson's roman. By the time Aldus had his roman made, the style
    was relatively mature. The Aldine italics, on the other hand, range in quality
    from beta to 1.0, depending on the cut, and they are relatively immature compared
    to the romans. So I would look at the next generation of Italian cursive types
    -- the 2.0 versions --; interestingly, these are the types that seem to have directly
    involved the input of writing masters like Arrighi and Alunno.\r\n\r\nAsk Antonio
    if you can look at his Edizioni il Polifilo volumes if he has them with him in
    the UK. There are three books dedicated to 15th Century Italian cursives, and
    an essay on Alunno in <em>Scritti di Giovanni Mardersteig sulla storia dei caratteri
    e della tipografia.</em>"
