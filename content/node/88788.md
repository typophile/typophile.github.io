  body: It's hard to know for sure exactly what impact selection in the TDC competition
    has on business or career. I view it as a form of publicity, cheap at the price,
    and I do know that my clients tend to be very happy when types I have designed
    for them are selected.

    involvement in the type industry can be attributed to being included in the TDC\xB2
    2002 competition. The visibility and distinction helped open doors."

  body: "Andreas, I've been fortunate to have \"placed\" in a few type\r\ncompetitions
    (although not the TDC) and although I haven't\r\nhad a client explicitly say \"I
    came to you because of that\r\ncompetition you won\" I have used the wins to woo
    new clients;\r\nand it's not difficult to imagine that somebody who sees your\r\nwork
    published in any capacity is more likely to give you\r\nbusiness - it's just like
    regular advertising. Also, getting the\r\ntop prize in Granshan 2008 helped me
    to get on the jury for\r\nGranshan 2010, and needless to say that looks pretty
    good on\r\na r\xE9sum\xE9. So it all builds up in various ways.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>The curator looked as if you had farted in his face.</em>\r\n\r\nOr smelled
    one of his own, as it dawned on him that his audience were type designers not
    academics, and that he was way off base.\r\n\r\nI had paid TDC good money to attend
    a seminar which included a visit to the New York Public Library to look at specimen
    books, and instead there I was being forced to sit through a dreary unillustrated
    talk on Russian history, which had very little to do with type. After 15 minutes
    of that, and with the clock ticking down to closing time, I decided I\u2019d do
    us all a favour at the expense of a little personal embarrassment. I don\u2019t
    recall exactly what I said, but I\u2019m pretty sure I would have interrupted
    the curator as politely as possible, with \u201CExcuse me\u2026\u201D which is
    by way of an apology.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t feel an apology to the other designers
    was necessary, as I assumed they were thankful for my little \u201Coutburst\u201D
    and I didn\u2019t poll them to see whether they were appalled, offended, or merely
    amused by it.\r\n"
