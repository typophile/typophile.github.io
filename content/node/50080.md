  of photos taken recently in California. As a Brit these signs are just so glamourous,
  they say 'America'- you don't get vertical signs like that over here. So much work
  goes into making them, but I suspect they're fast disappearing, being replaced by
  soulless laser-cut vinyl. As you can see some of them are a bit battered and rusted.
  They should be preserved but will probably end up in a skip. I drove past lots of
  fantastic examples, but couldn't be stopping every five minutes. I wish I had had
  much more time to photograph many more, but captured as many as possible. I'll be
  back, as The Governator would say. Hope you like them.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/30758026@N02/sets/72157607664316638/\">Signage

    last year, and whoever did the work has no taste at all. Before the gym had a
    great/tasteful vertical sign. Now it has cheesy inkjet banners that are coming
    apart in the wind. It makes me sad. '

  body: "Be fair here. Vinyl is cut with a knife plotter, not lasers. That, or hydrojet,
    is for cutting heavier material.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not the materials, it's
    that sign shop owners (the ones who aren't designers themselves) don't want to
    pay designers more than minimum wage and a half."
