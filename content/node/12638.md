  body: That "K" is very peculiar, so I would say customized Engravers' Gothic with
    a stroke added, or something like it.

    logo does look very Brody-like, but I can't pin its provenance. Yves must be right,
    though, I've never seen him be wrong!\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    spent my month at MetaDesign Berlin they were doing the communication for Haus,
    and I heard somebody say the logo was done by Neville. I don't think any court
    of law would uphold this as hard evidence though..."

    2nd book about his design career along with all the stuff for PARCO.

  body: "This came in from Cornel this morning:\r\n\r\n<em>yes i designed both typeface
    and logo when working at neville brody studio some time in the late 80s.\r\nthe
    typeface was designed starting from scratch, without looking at any particular
    existing typeface for reference.\r\nneville brody was working on it too, for a
    bit.\r\nthe letters were hand-drawn and we then rephotographed and cut and pasted
    them for use.\r\nthere is a very basic digital version which was done a couple
    of years later, buried deep on some syquest cartridge.\r\nit was never developed
    into a full font, and there is no lower case for it.\r\ni haven't looked at this
    font for years.</em>\r\n\r\nSee? You were right, Dan. I was wrong. ;-)"

    was done at his studio, so one could easily (mis)acredit the design to him.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for going to such levels to get the clear story out. This logo story needs to
    go in the wiki\u2026\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
