  My issue is that I am trying to compensate so I can print on Cougar Natural Opaque.
  So not only do I need to adjust for uncoated paper, but what is the best way to
  take yellow out of an image in Photoshop to compensate for the cream colored paper?\r\n"

  body: "James is spot on. I've always felt the best way to work is to get a good
    image on your calibrated equipment, which would include a profile, then as a final
    step, convert to the profile supplied by the printer. Sometimes testing is needed;
    one trick is to profile the printer's proofer, and it then becomes the printers
    job to match their proofs.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get the proper color balance
    is if there is a grayscale chart with (in) the image. For white, light gray, and
    medium gray, the amounts of red, green and blue should be about equal. Once you
    have the color balance corrected, then make a small change for the paper hue if
    you want.\r\n\r\nThere are some limitations to this -- you can't do everything
    with profiles. For example, you just won't get as deep a black on uncoated paper,
    so you can't get quite the shadow detail, and shouldn't try. We run proofs on
    a profiled inkjet or laser printer with the appropriate sheet type, & correct
    from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "I wouldn't go overboard adjusting yellow for a natural stock. The eye will
    always perceive the stock color as the relative white point, so any yellow correction
    to images will run the risk of actually looking too cool in context. I would talk
    the matter over with your printer, as has been suggested. \r\n\r\nOr contact someone
    at the paper manufacturer. Undoubtedly they've run some promotional campaigns
    and printed specimens of Cougar Natural with four-color photography. Someone there
    might have suggestions on profiles or compensations. Plus they might have specimens
    showing the same image on white and natural, which would allow you to judge for
    yourself if color compensation is even really warranted.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"
