  depends a lot upon color for differentiation and is to be used across different
  media. (For instance workbook covers and Keynote presentations.) \r\n\r\nThis got
  me thinking what are some of your favorite ways color has been used in systems?"

  body: "I've always liked duotones, especially when there's some selective masking
    or done with unusual spot colours.\r\n\r\nI'm impressed by the full-page, full-colour
    newspaper ads for Gwen Stefani's new tour, with the platinum and gold colour scheme,
    subtle bling -- like many tinted effects you can get with \"full-colour\" photoshop
    files it reminds me of those old duotone effects.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying
    is that there are graphic possibilities in the way pictures can be integrated
    into a colour system."

  body: "There was a book I saw once (and I'll NEVER remember the name) where the
    footnotes were color coded (bars behind the text) and then placed - in their color
    - in the margins. It wasn't ideal for readability necessarily but it looked fantastic
    and was very easy to use once you got used to it. And this was not a reading book.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also check out children's textbooks - they do more with color than adult stuff."

  body: I would suggest a heirecy of colors, dominate, secondary and maybe a third
    level. I will be working on a website in the near future that the dominate color
    is a dark gray. I have four complimentary colors already selected and another
    gray as a third level of color. Its not a system but tailored to the client.

  body: "The dominant color is black in my scheme. \r\n\r\nI wasn't necessarily asking
    for suggestions. I thought it would be interesting to see if others have noticed
    systems, for instance in book design, that can be linked here. Penguin books,
    for instance had a strong system."

  body: 'The way the entire Magic The Gathering trading card game revolves around
    colors that defined the concepts behind the game is great. It''s one of the most
    obvious parts of the whole rule system, but it quickly becomes subtle and makes
    way for gameplay mechanics which include a huge collection of type and symbols. '
