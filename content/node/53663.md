  drew me to this cover initially, was literally what the title read, \"I'm with the
  brand\". Then after taking a closer look I realized the actual letters were arranged
  and formed by these objects which were whited-out while the title popped out from
  the red background.  Anyways, I thought the way the images created the illusion
  of type was appealing and the way the images represented the \"brand products\"
  corresponded well with the book's plot.  \r\n\r\nT"

    how long it took the designer to find and draw all the objects? '
