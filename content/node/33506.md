  a \"second-color drop-shadow for the typeface Tempo\". However, \r\nthe only Tempo
  I can find is a condensed version.\r\n\r\nIs there a link between Tempo and Futura?
  And which other faces \r\ncould I use to \"fill in the gaps\"?"

    machinery in 1906, but the Ludlow caster which his company sold throughout the
    early twentieth century was a later device, designed and built by William Reade
    in 1909. The machine casts slugs from handset proprietary matrices and was therefore
    used for little except display type, but several Ludlow faces have been successfully
    adapted for digital text composition. The comapny issued both historical revivals
    and original designs, chiefly by its director of typography, R. H. Middleton.
    It ceased operation in North America in 1986. The English arm, founded in the
    early 1970s, closed in 1990.\r\n\r\n-Bringhurst, <cite>The Elements of Typographic

    The Tempo family was devised by the Ludlow Typograph Company as their answer to
    European sans, including Futura. It was pretty extensive:\r\n\r\nTempo Light &
    ital\r\nTempo Medium & ital\r\nTempo Medium Condensed\r\nTempo Bold & ital\r\nTempo
    bold condensed\r\nTempo Heavy Condensed\r\nTempo Heavy Inline\r\nLight & Bold
    ad figures, up to 144 point\r\nTempo Black\r\n\r\n& in my undated Ludlow specimen
    book [the marrooon one with the silver panel on the top board] Ludow Umbra comes
    right after the Tempo family. It is weighted about the same as Tempo Bold.\r\n\r\nAs
    an apprentice I set a lot of Umbra, but never set it as part of a 2-color setting
    with Tempo. It was always used alone. I suppose a careful compositor and then
    a careful press operator could have made that effect work, though.\r\n\r\nHead
    to a library and take a look at the Ludlow specimen books; you'll see Tempo in
    all its glory. Take note of the differences among the itals in different weights.
    \r\n\r\nCompare Umbra to Gill Sans Shadow.\r\n\r\nThis morning I cannot get to
    my other books about Ludlow to offer you other details; sorry. There's a book
    about Ludlow's guiding typographic light, R. Hunter Middleton; maybe it offers
    more info. & RHM wrote a small book about designing types; maybe there's something
    about Tempo in that.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n"

    doing a logo for a new building. We're suggesting setting the name of the building
    onto a large expanse of white wall, and as the sun passed over during the day
    it would throw different shadows (inspiation is mainly drawn from modernist architecture
    and how they applied signage to their buildings \u2013\_see pic). In order to
    do the visualisation in photoshop, I wanted the \"positive\" version to work with.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coal_3671.jpg]"

    of Berthold Grotesque. So if you wanted a "positive" version of the type you could
    start with Berthold Grotesque. This info from the 1983 edition of Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces by Jaspert, Berry & Johnson, my bible of type, or one of them. '

    response this morning and gotten down another source of info about Tempo: Mac
    McGrew's book \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century.\"\r\n\r\nThere
    he shows several other styles of Tempo, and credits R H Middleton with the entire
    series design. McGrew also alerts me to the fact that I was \"reading\" my Umbra
    specimen wrong; it is not weighted as heavily as Tempo Heavy, being in fact closer
    to Tempo Light.\r\n\r\nI've always considered Umbra a far more successful attempt
    at shadow than Gill Sans Shadow. The relation of positive to negative is much
    better realized in Umbra.\r\n\r\nGood luck with that project.\r\n\r\npowers"
