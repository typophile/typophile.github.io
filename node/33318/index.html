  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I bolted upright in bed this morning to song of birds singing their heads off, they were eating breakfast from the feed I put out the night before&hellip; Inside my head - I could still see shapes from the sleep of the night before.</p>
<p>The shapes were letters - six of them - spelling the word SPARKS.</p>
<p>And from the architecture which ran down either side of the letters I immediately recognized where these letters stood - they stood right straight down the middle of Sparks street mall - a venerable historic cobblestoned pedestrian street mall in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The letters stood 3-4 feet high, and had a substantial 3D volume to them - built of steel sheet and finished with a baked acrylic paint of bold primary or secondary colour. And each letter had it&rsquo;s own identity coming from the typeface it was of. And built with each letter is a two sided internally illuminated display panel which the stores of Sparks use to show off their stuff.</p>
<p>The letters were widely tracked running quite some length of Sparks.</p>
<p>All day long this friggin image nagged me - not unlike like thousands of images have done before - so what could I do but pick up the phone and call the Sparks street mall merchants association and get this thing off my mind&hellip;</p>
<p>After a really clumsy intro I layed out my idea to the gal in charge - and she just loved it!!, wants to see thumbnail sketches with a brief description to present to her board at the end of the month. In fact - she says to me that the mall is looking for just such a fresh idea to construct now that they&rsquo;re tearing down what is.</p>
<p>Okay&hellip; this thing now has my attention.</p>
<p>&hellip;and my curiousity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hiroshige, thanks for posting that story. I loved it.</p>
<p>Sounds like a designers equivalent of Rinzai Zen enlightenment :)</p>
<p>It would be great to see what you give her to present at the board meeting and which fonts you propose. Any chance you could upload an image of your idea?</p>
<p>Maybe each whole letter could be a display panel instead of just containing a rectangular screen.</p>
<p>I really hope it works out.</p>
