    but really it 'reads' as .JPEC

  body: "It's just a screenshot, and I didn't bother changing the extension cause
    it really doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nInteresting though. I thought it looked to much
    like a C too, but most people will probably still read JPEG first. Still, I think
    I'll have to try to make it look more like a G. "

  body: "Tweaked it a little with a small break in the shapes. I think you can better
    distinguish the G form a C now. Not sure about the E though. I wanted these simple
    shapes so I could play around with different things within these shapes. Like
    the sample included. The first one would be the simplest form. \r\n\r\nEdit: Can't
    seem to upload the pictures in this post, so I'll post them in the opening post.
    Afbeelding 4.png would be the simplest form."

  body: Still confusing. I would drop that chunk in the 'G' below the baseline, you'd
    get better letter/shape recognition that way, I believe.

  body: I'll give it a try, but I think I've already tried that. I believe I discarded
    it because it didn't really match with the other shapes.
