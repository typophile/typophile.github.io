body: I'm looking for suggestions for a headline and body typeface system of one or
  two max typefaces that will pair well on-screen with an existing logo that uses
  very tightly kerned Trebuchet. Aiming for elegance, readability and approachable
  in the high-tech zone. All suggestions are very appreciated. Thank you.
