  similar to the typface developed for the mexico 68 olymics. ive done a search in
  the forums but can't seem to find a name for it\r\n\r\nThe other one has been extruded
  in 3D but its the typeface below (i think the SuperFunk) is based on this.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You\u2019re right! It is REALLY Pump Triline.\r\n\r\nI think I've been looking
    at too many typefaces lately that I may have developed a hallucinatory \u201CIDer\u2019s
    block\u201D where some of the characters don\u2019t seem to match when they obviously
    do. In this case the S looked wayyy curvy but it isn\u2019t\u2026 maybe I need
    a break! :^)\r\n"
