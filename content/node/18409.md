    seems to have almost the charactersitics of both fonts, if you assume the missing
    serifs on MD were edited out. It is one of the few fonts I have come across with
    the M 'crotch' near but not on the baseline, and the W the same situation, but
    inverted. Looking at a test drive, I see the shape of the italic 'b' is wrong,
    so I am still looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      It doesn't seem custom either, besides some edited serifs.\r\n\r\nany other
      luck out there?"
