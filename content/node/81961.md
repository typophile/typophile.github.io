  FF Disturbance:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_disturbance_ot/
  \r\n\r\nI find the letter \"G\" in it really interesting, and I've never seen anythig
  nlike it before. The G in Bayer Universal is similar, but this seems to me like
  a wholly new idea.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any information on where this hybrid
  upper/lower case \"G\" originated? (I consider the Bayer Universal G to also be
  a sort of hybrid upper/lowercase, but I haven't seen one with a loop like that before)\r\n\r\nEdit:
  For those interested, upon some investigation, I found that the creator of Disturbance
  later created a super fleshed-out family based on the original Disturbance, called
  \"Redisturbed\":\r\n\r\nhttp://typography.net/fontfamilies/view/23"
