  for a classy serif font. It will be used in longer texts. DIN will be used for headlines
  and lead.\r\n\r\nAlternative it would also be nice to have a sans serif font that
  is very legible in long texts. Depending on the clients wish I'll offer both alternatives
  for him to choose from.\r\n\r\nThnx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    mrs eaves.\r\n\r\ndo not mix 2 sans serifs on the same page... if you are looking
    for a sans serif that will be ok on long runs, try cronos or bliss.\r\n\r\ndr"

    BT</a> \u2013 which is quite cheap \u2013 if you don't need OSF.\r\n\r\nI would
    not mix FF Din with another Sans, could cause problems with contrast \u2026"

    \r\nSabon also seems to work. This is also an option I'll present.\r\nI'm not
    a big fan of slab serifs and personally I don't think that it matches with DIN."

  body: I've found a really nice combination. I tried DIN with Dolly and it fits perfect,
    imho. The client liked it too, so I'm happy.

    be risky, but it's not a dogma. It depends...\r\nHere's the picture with something
    that is surely not beautiful, but IMHO neither totally ugly or dysfunctional.\r\nSorry
    for no word space adjustments and random choice of text (I wouldn't really use
    DIN for Habsburgs :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_3989.jpg]"
