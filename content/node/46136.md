  at a graduate-level.\r\n\r\nDo any of you have degrees in Typography? From where?
  Any other thoughts on the subject?\r\n\r\nI am a graphic designer/design student
  working tirelessly towards a BFA in graphic design. I plan on earning a masters
  degree in the arts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEvan\r\n\r\nPlease note <a href=\"http://evanmade.com\"
