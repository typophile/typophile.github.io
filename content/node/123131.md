    closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans|Museo Sans]]
    (500) but don't think that's the one. At first sight, main difference is on /M
    centre vertex position."

  body: I'm sorry but even if the website is using Omnes, it isn't Omnes and I really
    doubt it could have been based on it or at least so heavily customized it would
    probably better to start with Museo Sans.

  body: I already looked at the source code, but they use it for the text not for
    the logo.
