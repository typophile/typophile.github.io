  expects to receive the goods within a reasonable span of time. My payment for a
  T bij credit card has been processed years ago and I still haven\u2019t received
  one. AND I have mentioned this often to moderators. AND I have mailed about this.\r\n\r\n(If
  selling and delivering stuff is not your thing, then abstain from that activity\u2026)"

  body: "Bert, Florian, we've recognized the difficulty in managing inventory and
    online orders. Which is why we took down the store with hopes of someday partnering
    with a group that can handle fulfillment better. (International orders get particularly
    tricky.)\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to send you a refund check or mail you a shirt if
    we still have one in stock. Can you please email typophile (at) punchcut (dot)
    com with your preference and address info. "
