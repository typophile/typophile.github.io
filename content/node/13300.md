body: "An upgrade to Tiger was the straw that broke Suitcase's back for me. It wouldn't
  render common fonts in my browser, took forever to activate a font, and finally
  locked up my machine. I've been giving FontAgent Pro a try and, though I don't love
  its interface, it has not caused me any problems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I walked
  away from Suitcase, I also had to walk away from the font sets that I created for
  it. I spent many hours sorting thousands of fonts into sets according to (my best
  assessment of) their general category -- slab serif, gothic, geometric, symbol,
  script, etc. This upfront work paid off every time I went to the well to make a
  new font choice. All this got me thinking...\r\n\r\nWhy don't font files include
  meta-data that specifies their category?! <!--break--> Or how about a database of
  fonts and categories to which font management programs could automatically connect,
  as iTunes does with CDDB to identify tracks on a newly imported CD? Pipe dream?
  Or maybe I could create this myself and make thousands of dollars?!"

  body: "Bert is correct. It's not a new idea. But Panose is outdated, relatively
    archaic, and only works for text faces. I can see how a new system with a free
    online database hookup could be killer.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, btw, to input Panose
    values in FontLab and other font creation software, but few do it."

  body: "The Panose system is fascinating, but only if it is widely used. And, yeah,
    Bert, you caught my drift... \"This is such a big idea, it could make me a thousandaire!\"
    With such a small market, I think that's about the best I could hope for.\r\n\r\nThomas,
    is Font Reserve good at this task? I would imagine that its database would have
    to be huge and very current to be of much use. I would gladly convert if it performs
    that task well."

  body: 'I tackled Panose properly for the first time last year, for the MS ClearType
    Font Collection. It isn''t the easiest thing in the world, so I''m not surprised
    that few font developers take the time to do it properly. And it does need to
    be done properly: you can''t cheat with the Panose system and, especially, you
    must not make guesses about the correct values based on interpreting the Panose
    classification terminology. The terminology used by Panose is largely unrelated
    to the ways in which similar terms are used by most typographers and type designers;
    I''m not sure why, and I think it would have been better if Panose had stuck to
    a purely numerical system and avoided ''descriptive'' terms completely. Panose
    is based on careful measurement of various aspects of key glyphs in a typeface,
    and calculations based on those measurements. Sometimes, the resulting values
    may correspond to Panose descriptive terms that are not at all how you would describe
    your typeface, but it is the values that are important to the whole Panose idea,
    not the terms.'
