<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Greetings, <br> <br>I am trying to make a Type1 Logo Font, with FontLab 4.6 on Mac OS X. <br> <br>To get the best possible result (details), I am using a UPM value of 5000. If I could, I would go even higher. Does this makes sense or am I off track. Is there a limit on UPM value one can use? At a value of 1000, the shapes gets distorted while at 5000, this is almost perfect. <br> <br>In Suitcase (OS X) I just can't see the glyph I assigned to the letter "B". Is there an easy way to generate this Type1 font for Mac? <br> <br>What would be the most important parameters to use (in FontLab -- Font Info), to make sure it works OK? <br> <br>Kind Regards, <br> <br>Yves</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>FWIU no matter what UPM you use in the design space, once you make a Type1 font it is converted to a 1000 UPM so by working at 5000, you will introduce rounding errors. <br> <br>If the logo is that detailed that 1000 UPM wokspace make it distorted, it may be best to keep in in an importable eps format. <br> <br>Or make a TrueType version of the logo, working at 2048 and with FontLab you can hint the Bejeezes out of it to control its small size rendering. <br> <br>James</div>

<div class=commentbody>Huh. That's an unfortunate limitation. The Type 1 format itself supports arbitrary UPM values (though 1000 is what people almost universally use). <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>So maybe I'm wrong. I've just always found that font deitors export Type1 at 1000 upm. Is there a work around. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have a logo font here, that I created a while back when I was on Mac OS 9.2 or 8.5. Never had troubles with it until I moved to OS X. I was using it principaly for my invoices in FileMaker. I would then output the FileMaker invoice to a PDF file, where my Logo Font was embedded. This, gave a more interesting finish than importing an eps in FileMaker. It was a question of antialiasing. I did many tests and never succeeded to import a vector graphic in FileMaker that would output as vectors. It seems it always convert the file to a pict. <br> <br>Since I moved to OS X, that font is not working anymore and I don't understand why. Wish someone could explain me why. <br> <br>To make a test, I just opened in FontLab 4.6 this working Type 1 LogoFont (the PS file) I created a while back, and in the Info, the UPM shows to be 5882. <br> <br>I have the feeling that something has changed in OS X and I don't know what and why...? <br> <br>What I liked, and that was sort of usefull, is the negative kerning, where the combination of different keys was giving me the possibility to use a mask underneath the logo, and to color differently each parts, depending on the visual application. <br> <br>If anyone interested... give me a ring and I'll send you the LogoFont to check. <br> <br>I feel I have been struggling with this issue since too long now. I discovered this forum yesterday and said to myself: "If no one has the answer here... you will never have any". <br> <br>This forum seems to be the good place to ask for help. <br> <br>Kind Regards, <br> <br>Yves</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, this was reported as a bug to the FontLab folks a while back. I just tested it in FontLab 4.6.1 and it seems to work fine! <br> <br>I took Myriad Pro Italic, set the em square to 2200, didn't scale the glyphs, and exported as a (renamed) Type 1. The resulting font behaves as I would expect. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nope, I'm not on OS X myself. Sorry for missing this point earlier. So two questions: <br> <br>- does the tool support making such fonts? <br>- do they work in OS X? <br> <br>If they don't work in OS X, that would be an OS X bug. It would not be the first significant OS X problem that causes perfectly good fonts to not work. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0> <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Years ago, when I first tried making Type 1 fonts with arbitrary UPM values, I did find that some PS emulations in printers gagged on anything other than 1000. Not sure whether this would be a live issue.</div>
