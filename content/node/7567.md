body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m considering drawing a script font using existing handwriting.
  I never did any script fonts so starting from something existing seems a little
  reassuring for a start. It&#39;s all photocopies so a little bit rough. I&#39;ll
  also have to extrapolate a lot of punctuation signs.  <BR> <BR>I was wondering if
  anyone would have advice or tips on planning for drawing scripts? Any common mistakes
  I should avoid? <BR> <BR>Also, do you believe it is harmful/beneficial to one&#39;s
  skills to redraw letters to make a font? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>

  body: '&#40;OK, I guess I&#39;ll reply here. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>First of all, I can&#39;t
    imagine any legal barriers to making a font from somebody&#39;s handwriting. But
    of course the ethical requirement to ask for permission is there. If he gives
    you a good reason why you shouldn&#39;t do it, I don&#39;t think you should. But
    if he says no because he&#39;s become a crazy old man, ignore him &#40;but still
    be kind&#41;. And if he&#39;s dead, a token seance attempt would be a nice gesture.  ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never really made a script face &#40;TMF Roupen is not an original
    design&#41;, so I hope others can help you more - I do remember some threads on
    Typophile addressing script design &#40;with Stuart and Mark giving good pointers
    IIRC&#41;, but in the technical realm I would point out this: If it&#39;s an <i>irregular</i>
    script &#40;as most handwriting fonts are&#41;, take time studying letter adjacency
    frequencies &#40;something Excoffon took very seriously&#41;. If you do, this
    might be useful: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/37652.html"
