    favourite font of all those seen on that screen is the one used below \"SANFORD
    76\" (N\xB024)...\r\nPretty difficult, hm? But if anyone could help us there...
    ,) thanks...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flx_typo_us-Sanford_5859.jpg]\r\n\r\nLooks
    like a mixture between the fonts used for the \"MEXICO 68\" and the \"NASA\" logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MexiSA_5691.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,
