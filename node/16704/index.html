<p>just moments ago, i received the latest [and final] issue of Emigre. to my surprise, the entire book is set in Filosofia and i was wondering what you all thought.</p>
<p>i remember there was a recent topic in which some people felt very strongly about the use of a modern face for text and i find it interesting that the people who created this typeface decided to use it in this way.</p>
<p>thoughts?..</p>
<p>btw
it is not my intent to citicize Emigre for this.</p>

<p>in the book, Rudy Vanderlans does a little paraphrasing of his own:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zuzana&rsquo;s notion, that people read best what they read most, is a post-structuralist critique, or so we&rsquo;re told.

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing arbitrary about the shape of the human retina or how our brains prefer to decipher and compile information. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much FF Extra you read, you&rsquo;ll still read FF Quadraat better (assuming a few hours of training if you just happen to be Tarzan and Jane only showed you texts set in FF Extra for two years or something).</p>
<p>Legibility is open to change? Duh. That&rsquo;s the easy part. Some of us are trying to better grasp the hard part. And what about the true nature of Familiarity - like how quickly is it gained? Virtually nobody has had the balls to consider that seriously. Sixty-nine issues and you&rsquo;d think the entire foundation of their design philosophy would get some critical, lucid airtime&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it suits the kind of writing the magazine contains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my book the intent of a publication would have to be pretty strange to <cite>really</cite> justify any Bodoni*. For example, Hamm&rsquo;s book on Arabic is very suited to it, but only because its premise is laughably Modernist. To quote** G W Ovink: &ldquo;Bodoni is an admirable letter for a death notice!&rdquo; So yes, <cite>any</cite> font is useful sometimes&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Although we would have to define &ldquo;Bodoni&rdquo;. Much harder than one might think!</li>

<p>But there is no reason to banish science as one tool of the tools used in design. Science isn&rsquo;t just useful for consistancy in craft or art.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but not utterly unique. Overlaps dominate. Big time.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is something to this but it&rsquo;s not nearly enough to base a whole theory of type design on - and it isn&rsquo;t a practical place to start. I think she meant it as a tweak on the nose of sleepy stolid type industry. I am not sure it didn&rsquo;t need it at the time. Radicals often have to overstate things to be heard. Who knows what she says over a glass of wine. She may be mellower. And even if she isn&rsquo;t - so what?</p>
<p>Dogmas are not helpful - skepticism and using your own eyes is.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>who&rsquo;s trying to banish science?  i am just making the point that in design, it is dangerous to assume that there is only one way to do something. as i said before, it&rsquo;s not the end all. if it was, then someone would figure out the super-perfect-absolute-complete-and-total-legibility-formula and all type would look the same.</p>
<p>perhaps someone is on the verge of cracking this code? is that going to make people read and understand things any better? who knows??</p>
<p>i read an article in Print about a typeface called Clearview. its creators are on a crusade to convert all the roadsigns in america to what they believe to be a superior typeface. in their minds, this is supposed to improve something. i think the improvement would be marginal, at best.</p>
<p>in this example we are discussing Filosfia as an effective textface. Filosofia is based on Bodoni, which doesn&rsquo;t work for text, due to its high stroke contrast. however, according to Emigre, the contrast in Filosofia was toned down in order to make it more suitable for text. i agree with this and feel that it is working fine in the book.</p>
<p>is there another typeface out there that would work better? perhaps.</p>
<p>Emigre is not the end all either. maybe i just like the fact that Zuzanna Licko&rsquo;s types are not perfect. they seem like they were crafted by a human being and i think that gives them a lot of character. perhaps Filosofia isn&rsquo;t the most legible typeface ever created—i never said it was.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, and an important factor.

<p>Just to be clear: I didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean Peter. Plus do note the &ldquo;or something&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know the nature of the book Peter used a Bodoni for, or the true nature of his life, so&hellip; That said, frankly I do think he&rsquo;s too Modernist; and setting Bodoni (justified?&hellip;) is one possible symptom of that.</p>
<p>BTW:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the contrast in Filosofia was toned down
in order to make it more suitable for text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why even bother, if WRBWWRM? Just like with something like NotCaslon, the reader will get used to anything and everything after the first paragraph or something anyway, right?</p>
<p>The truth is: that was a good move; and Licko&rsquo;s skills and understanding have -not surprisingly- improved over the years. Unfortunately what has been lacking is an admission that good craft matters after all; that even something as subtle as stroke contrast has an effect on the quality of the product. What has been lacking is a big fat asterisk on their mantra.</p>

<p>And that might in fact be another case of good usage of a Bodoni.

<p>First I&rsquo;d have to make the time to get a copy (and I&rsquo;m sure some day I will).

The merits of text face design are &ldquo;subvisible&rdquo;, and conscious layman ignorance is no justification for bad craft.</p>

<p>I agree. I have a certain positive feeling about the old face in terms of culture - wacky I know - but driving in bad weather I will be grateful for signs in the new typeface. Or even good weather! This is not to say that it would be impossible to improve on in future either.</p>

<p>Okay, just tying to clarify. There are plenty of folks all too eager to kick science out of what they see as their &lsquo;creative space&rsquo;.

Even if he sometimes overstates things himself. Anyway I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend or to lump you (or him).</p>

<p>Even then, even if such a thing were to happen, type would by no means have to look or feel the same. Supporting reading in typeface design is a complex balance and there is always going to be a variety of possible balances available to be struck. There is no danger from any frankenomniuniversiclonetype. That&rsquo;s a false boogeyman if ever there was one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure.
Consider what happened to newspaper text type in the 20th century, with corporate-technological concentration leading to a monopoly position for Linotype machines, combined with a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; ideology of legibility directing font development. There wasn&rsquo;t much choice of text faces, and that part of our culture became stagnant prior to Murdoch&rsquo;s Augean cleansing.</p>
<p>Now take a look at Microsoft&rsquo;s ClearType faces. They&rsquo;re a very close bunch designwise, from a combination of pre-design criteria that made it difficult for them to be otherwise. Some of that is the constraints of the technology leading to certain optimal forms, some of it &ndash; in particular the Greek and Cyrillic &ndash; is due to the conservative one-size-fits-all culture that globalized corporate concentration engenders. And some of it is design that panders to the &ldquo;faster is better&rdquo; aesthetic beloved of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>Reductive design theories based on supposed scientific logic have been used as the basis of design reform for centuries. The engineering of real-world products always falls short, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop the next generation of engineers saying &ldquo;that was then, but we&rsquo;ll get it right now. Pony up the cash and let&rsquo;s get that Star Wars shield built pronto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One should also be aware of that progressive ethos in design where subtlety of execution is derided, where the preferred type is Arial, and the preferred logo is a square with the name knocked out. Here, artists are thinkers, not makers. This is a genuinely new paradigm, and if it leads to frankenomniuniversiclonetype, then perhaps that&rsquo;s the way things are supposed to go in our MicroMacrAppleGooglAdobia future.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it&rsquo;s in much-needed opposition to the globalizing scourge that is Latinization, such as in the design of Greek fonts based on an egocentric &ldquo;internal consistency&rdquo; formal Modernist hobgoblin, something users at large need about as much as a slave labourer needs better chains.</p>

<p>Indeed. But lately the misguided &ldquo;artist mentality&rdquo; that Eben elaborated on has had too much sway, at least in the field of type design, and it&rsquo;s time to right the balance. The widespread, sincere, intelligent and brave reaction you&rsquo;re seeing now, and the timely fall of the 90s aesthetic (not to mention that of the 2-3 decades preceding it) is natural and needed. Maybe what would work is if I pointed out that it&rsquo;s simply no longer fashionable&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about conservatism, not Latinization.
The gatekeepers hired by Microsoft to authenticate its Greek and Cyrillic bundled fonts are conservatives, necessarily, given the extent of the font distribution, and their role as guardians, buffers lightening the heavy hand of cultural imperialism.
But wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to let users speak with their own voices?
And make their own choices about which fonts they prefer to use?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I prefer the &ldquo;design mentality&rdquo;, which contains the best aspects of both science and art.
What concerns me is when the design mentality loses its balance, and pays too much attention to either art or science.</p>
<p>The digital revolution wasn&rsquo;t solely about crazy fonts. There was some pretty wack software out there too, science run amok, if you will. It wasn&rsquo;t artists who screwed up graphics and typography by inventing Photoshop filters, for instance. It was a Pandora&rsquo;s box, to call it &ldquo;misguided&rdquo; is absurd &ndash; you can&rsquo;t have a guided revolution! When I say screwed up, that&rsquo;s not a diss, &ldquo;the roads of excess lead to wisdom&rdquo; as Wm Blake put it.</p>
<p>Hrant, I&rsquo;m puzzled how you reconcile two aspects of your philosophy.
On the one hand, you&rsquo;re all for a scientific understanding of how reading works, but on the other you&rsquo;re against Modernism, which is surely hand in glove with science.
Please explain.</p>

<p>No, they&rsquo;re not - at least not in the way that matters most - at least not the Greek side. The norm for contemporary Greek type for one remains that of Latinization, and the MS fonts go against that. In this case conservatism equates to Latinization. So when it comes to non-Latin design, strangely enough you&rsquo;re the one on the conservative side believe it or not!  :-)</p>

because it was Latinized by royal decree&hellip;</p>

<p>I can see how it&rsquo;s confusing in this environment where everything is lumped within two extremes, be those Science or Art, or Chirography and Post-Modernism; but there is [at least] a third way.</p>
<p>The trick with separating Science and Modernism is leveraging the former as a tool without falling for the latter as an ideology. You don&rsquo;t turn Science into a religion; faith is always necessary, but not in something that&rsquo;s only half the story. The key is to realize the limits of knowledge, of control; but this does not justify breaking windows for the hell of it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t try to make a perfectly legible type. But neither do I go ahead and make whatever useless junk my emotions tell me to. I study, I think, and then try to <cite>serve others</cite> - even if I know I can never fully succeed. What Science can do is guide, and what Modernism can&rsquo;t do is relinquish control, to jump into the darkness - but that&rsquo;s the only way to mark progress. The PoMo people had good intentions and good instincts, but they let their selves dominate what is necessarily a servile field. So I guess now we need to find another term for what <cite>should</cite> have been&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, your points re frankenomniuniversiclonetype are excellent but I am not sure they add up to the imminent utter dominance of frankenomniuniversiclonetype. I mean sure Arial &amp; Verdana &amp; eventaully the Cleartypes will dominate in the sense that they will be &lsquo;unfairly&rsquo; ubiquitous. But there is more choice now than there has ever been &amp; that is set to keep improving. Some of the choices are not too sweet &amp; there are not too many fonts made with their point size in mind, or version for pt sizes or whatever we might most want but there is lots &amp; lots &amp; lots of choice. I am not saying that it is a wonderful market. That would be a different thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s ClearType</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this state of affairs any worse or better than the font sets offered in the past? I would say that it&rsquo;s slightly better because the printed type will suffer less in cleartype from the imposition of screen needs on the type design.</p>
<p>The thing about an OS &amp; bundled fonts is that in general you do need to be sure that an average user&rsquo;s basic needs are met by offering some type or the OS is useless. In the case of 80&rsquo;s &amp; 90&rsquo;s OS - the type had to be what it was - screen &amp; print type where loads of compromise was made so that sceeen could match print to some degree.</p>
<p>While I understand your point about OS &amp; application companies bundling too many fonts I also know that the ubiquity of Georgia &amp; Verdana made me happy because I was tired of Arial &amp; Times.</p>
<p>Reading over your posts here I am not sure what you would advocate - or precisely the nature of your complaint because much of the way it things are today seems inevitable to me. On the other hand I would like to know how you would do things if you ran MicroMacrAppleGooglAdobia. Would you for instance suggest a voucher system where users could use their points towards independant fondry fonts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The digital revolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though some dubious type was &amp; there were some design excesses I don&rsquo;t particularly regret what happened in the 90&rsquo;s. Some really wonderful stuff happened too. At some point the interest in craft etc will turn into a willfull bullheaded unthinking kneeejerk &lsquo;conservatism&rsquo; which will need to be tweaked again - albeit in a new way.</p>
<p>Nobody was stopping anybody from doing good work in the 90&rsquo;s. Nobody is stopping us now. What people are willing to pay for is a different issue.</p>

<p>Again focusing on the Greek:
What&rsquo;s &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;? Current Greek tradition is Latinized, and only specialists are aware of the old stuff*. These fonts are against that - they are a gentle, quiet revolution of sorts, and if it takes a megacorporation to give a culture the boost it needs while the masses are diluting it, hey, then that&rsquo;s one good thing about MS! Not as good as a benign monarch, but still. :-)  The fact that free fonts from large companies make life harder for some small type designers is quite secondary in terms of the wider benefits to society. One has to be candid and brave enough to admit that. If MS were pushing heavily Latinized crap on people, then I&rsquo;d complain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noting BTW that many experts -especially native ones- consider things like the Aldine Greek to be misguided design. Did you know that?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I was talking about end users choosing their own fonts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I was talking about deciding what kinds of fonts to make, so way before there&rsquo;s a chance for that. And if you base your font-making decisions entirely on what&rsquo;s already out there, of course you&rsquo;re marking zero cultural progress. While if you base your design decisions on what turns you on personally, chances are quite good very few other people will need the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s because they really want them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is not good enough. That&rsquo;s what happened in the 70s to Greek. Please stop.</p>
<p>A society based on wants is exactly what&rsquo;s sending the world downhill of late.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I trust my emotions (I’ve been practising for a while, so hopefully
I’ve developed some useful design instincts), and try and make the
type read as well as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is exactly without Science that you can&rsquo;t strike a good balance between the two. Myself, I have faith that based on what [I think] users need (not merely want) and guided by Science (although not the formal western definition of it) my self-expression will result in useful things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between trusting one&rsquo;s emotions (which everybody does to some extent, but nobody should do absolutely) versus guiding one&rsquo;s self-expression towards serving others. I&rsquo;ve been making fonts -for other people- for over 20 years now, but I still try to look upon my emotions from the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; instead of getting drunk on them - I feel that&rsquo;s the key to being a reasonable world citizen.</p>

<p>So Nick, please give advice to somebody trying to decide what sort of Greek fonts to make by telling us what experience you have with gauging what Greek font users want*. What Greek-font-buyers have you interviewed, and what market research** have you carried out? Also: Did you base Albany on any such thing, or did you base it instead on a desire to exercise internally-consistent formalist shape-making, leading off directly from the Latin master that you so emotionally&hellip; painted?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, just want, for the sake of argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Of course you&rsquo;d have to do the research yourself, only a clueless idiot would rely on the research of others, right?</p>

<p>I am not sure what you would advocate - or precisely the nature of your complaint because much of the way it things are today seems inevitable to me.</p>

<p>I am not sure what I would advocate. My complaint is that font bundling by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe is unfair to independent foundries. Perhaps their behavior is inevitable, because nobody is powerful enough to stop them.</p>
<p>BTW, I agree with you that there is lots of opportunity for good work, and there is a strong market for indie fonts. The narrow focus of the ClearType fonts should leave space for other foundries to fill. So it is not all doom and gloom. But for the mainstream of font users who don&rsquo;t buy indie fonts, it&rsquo;s homogenous typography &ndash; no matter how good the type design and how sharp the image.</p>
<p>Hrant, your most recent post (11.18) was much more polite and intelligent, and I&rsquo;m tempted to reply, but I&rsquo;m not going to continue the discussion, because from past experience I know that you would soon again resort to personal attacks (eg 11.35).</p>

<p>Then why did you remove your -balanced and full- reply to the allegedly offensive post <cite>after</cite> I made the good one? Do you not value your own expressions beyond their tactical/rhetorical value? Is this a little battle you&rsquo;re waging, as you&rsquo;ve alluded to before? Because I can&rsquo;t see the battlefield - or at least the one I see doesn&rsquo;t have you in it. Note also that the post you removed also contained direct reference to the souvlaki comment&hellip; I guess maybe you were in a more balanced mood last night as opposed to this morning? After all, we&rsquo;re all human. Hey, maybe you need a vacation&hellip; in Greece.  :-)</p>
<p>(Man, don&rsquo;t you just wish you could edit <cite>my</cite> posts as well!)</p>

<p>If I were you, I&rsquo;d have a much better reason not to reply: your position
is virtually indefensible. But artists don&rsquo;t need to justify their work.</p>
<p>Really, Nick, it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s your ideas.
You&rsquo;d have to be friend or family for me
to actually care personally.</p>

<p>It took you overnight to realize my post was offensive, and then it
took you almost two hours* to replace your post with a single line?
Come on, Nick, this isn&rsquo;t a sandbox. If your position is defensible,
and being a prolific poster it&rsquo;s not like you can&rsquo;t make the time,
then please make the time (or at least don&rsquo;t spend time removing
balanced things you&rsquo;ve already written).</p>
<ul>
<li>And tellingly a few minutes after I made my &ldquo;good&rdquo; post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I hope you have good holidays - I really do.</p>
