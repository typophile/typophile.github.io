  body: Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>I like the basic idea, but I think you are using two different
    styles. The &#39;a h m n y&#39; are a little flattened on the top and/or bottom
    and have a very nice serif. But with the &#39;b d g p q&#39; you use a different
    kind of serif. Perhaps you should try to use the same serif style. <BR>I would
    also remove the lower serif on the &#39;q&#39;.  <BR>I can&#39;t really see if
    the serifs have a pointy or block end. I kind of like the look on the &#39;n&#39;.
    But I see that the &#39;m&#39; has a block-end serif &#40;does this make sence?
    My English is rosty&#41;. <BR> <BR>How about serifs like this? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12598.gif"

  body: '&#62; the u looks optically wider <BR> <BR>Yes, and that&#39;s because the
    tops of letters bear more weight. And of course in a serif face the inside has
    two half-serifs in the &#34;n&#34; but only one in the &#34;u&#34;, and that amplifies
    the effect. <BR> <BR>If somebody has made the counters of the &#34;n&#34; and
    &#34;u&#34; mathematically the same, it means he&#39;s either oblivious to this
    optical issue... or he simply wants the &#34;u&#34; to look wider! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;d like to see a version of &#34;b&#34; without the tail/spur, to distinguish
    it from the &#34;d&#34;. You might try leaving it rounded, or bringing it to a
    subtle corner instead of using a spur or a tail. <BR> <BR>Also, whatever solution
    you use for &#34;h&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, &#34;n&#34;, &#34;r&#34; and &#34;u&#34;
    should harmonize with the &#34;y&#34;, at least in the form you have chosen for
    it. <BR> <BR>I would also suggest shortening to top end of the &#34;s&#34; slightly,
    to avoid the appearance that it is about to fall over to the right. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    be curious to see what roman serif faces this design might complement. It seems
    to me to be a fairly original sans serif design. I&#39;m excited to see what you
    can do with it. <BR> <BR>David

  body: 'Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>some little things come to my eye seeing your font: <BR>-
    In all the ascenders are diagonally cut of at the top. Why not do the same with
    the &#39;L&#39;? <BR>- the lower part of the &#39;e&#39; could be a little shorter.
    Like this it optically gives you the feeling of &#39;falling backwords&#39;. &#40;&#42;Maybe&#42;
    then you could keep the tilted bar??? I kind of liked it.&#41;. The same goes
    for the &#39;c&#39;. The lower part just a little shorter. &#40;blue arrows&#41;
    <BR>- the &#39;a&#39; is now the only glyph with a tail. Why not remove that also?
    This optically makes the bulb a little bigger. That also benefits the readability.
    &#40;yellow arrow&#41; <BR>- I would think about making the dots on the &#39;i&#39;
    and &#39;j&#39; a little less higher. Keeping them under the body height doesn&#39;t
    optically stretch those glyphs too much.  <BR>- the &#39;t&#39; looks a little
    bit to unsofisticated, &#39;simple&#39;. you should try to get a little more character
    in there. <BR>- Can it be that the &#39;x&#39; is too thin compared to the oter
    glyphs? You also have to optically correct the center of it, where all the legs
    come together. Try looking for other fonts. There you will see that those legs
    don&#39;t really meet in the middle. But optically they seem to do so. <BR>- Maybe
    it&#39;s the display, but the &#39;n&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;v&#39;, &#39;x&#39;
    seem all a little too thin to me. <BR>- Last but not least. It looks like the
    round parts are half circles. Maybe you could just take the symmetry out of them
    by pushing one side a little bit out &#40;look for the red arrows&#41;. By doing
    that they will look a little bit more like the &#39;b&#39; and &#39;d&#39;. Because
    they have a little straight part in their bulb, the tend to look more squared.
    I think you want it to look a little bit squared, so try to force the glyphs to
    do that. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13539.gif"
    alt="Corrected"> <BR> <BR>Phoei, that took me some time to write that out. I hope
    this makes sence and will help you a little farther on the way.  <BR>I like the
    font and would like to see it ready. I&#39;m very curious about your numbers.

    <BR>I preferred the tail-less b, h, i and spur-less g. &#40;The t is too tall,
    but that looks like it might be scaling mistake, not a design decision.&#41; I
    also miss the flared join that you used on the m, n and u. &#40;The new m is kinda
    homely. Consider using a common approach on both arches.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Finally,
    the descenders on the g and y seem too deep for the shortish ascenders.
