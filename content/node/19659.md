body: "Hello, im using Fontlab 4.6 and i have just built my own font.\r\n\r\nIm thinking
  about making a bold version of the type and transforming the glyphs one by one seems
  like a very ineffective way to do it. I think I have read somewhere that there should
  be some kind of \"auto-transform-glyphs command\"?\r\n\r\nThank you, Fredrik"

  body: in the font window, select all glyphs, apple-transform and that will apply
    the transformation to all that is selected. be sure to make a back-up copy of
    the original!
