  titles:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Police Generique Running Man_4686.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  believe this font was also used in \"The Terminator\" Opening titles, and in the
  movie as the font used by the T-800 internal screen.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the
  one who'll find it.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nHal"
