  I'm having to replace. Thankfully I was able to retrieve a very valuable font to
  me. But somehow they got slightly damaged. Certain fonts in the <em>Interstate</em>
  family lost their proper name/file info. They all install, but don't show up.\r\nFor
  instance, installing Regular shows up as regular. Installing Regular Italic doesn't
  show up at all, but is listed in the fonts folder in C:\\Windows\\Fonts.\r\nI want
  them to be properly named again. Could anybody do this or teach me how to fix this
  error? I have no idea where to start."

    with random garbage -- it's virtually impossible to \"repair\" them. Even getting
    to find out what's wrong with them is difficult for a pro, let along having to
    <em>guess</em> what there was in the first place.\r\n\r\nHave your original bill
    ready and contact your font supplier for replacement files."

  body: The problem with getting a replacement is that I purchased them years ago
    and I no longer have any "proof of purchase". They still have their Copyright
    information and display name in windows explorer. So I know which font is which.
    The computer doesn't. Thanks for the reply.

    how they work?\r\n\r\nDoes the italic font show up correctly in Adobe Creative
    Suite apps such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign?"
