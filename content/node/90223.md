  body: I don't think you're "going wrong" anywhere, it's simply that the Shape Builder
    tool doesn't get you all the way there, and you seem to basically understand what
    needs to be done next. Since some of the anchor points are overlapping, first
    move the paths away from each other, then break them apart into pieces using the
    scissor tool. To avoid issues with overlapping anchors, I'd suggest breaking every
    anchor to get nine short paths. Use those pieces to assemble the shape's three
    main curves with smooth joins, then move those into position and reconnect the
    corner joins.

  body: "The same think can be easily achieved with the pathfinder tool. \r\n\r\n1.
    Make the eye-like shape by means of overlapping two circles and leaving only the
    overlapping part.\r\n\r\n2.Make three copies of the shape and flip one of them
    to 60* and the other to -60*.\r\n\r\n3. Overlap the three shapes and join them
    into one.\r\n\r\nGet it?"

  body: That's another way to create the basic shape, but the OP's objective is to
    make the path follow one continuous circuit. I don't see how that can be done
    using Pathfinder tools.

  body: I dont see what do you mean. You just join the tree shapes into one.

  body: "Join them how? Unite them? That doesn't create a single, self-intersecting
    path as described in the video (at 2:16). Your method does suggest a cleaner solution
    though.\r\n\r\n1. Create a crescent shape by overlapping two circles and Pathfinder
    > Intersect.\r\n\r\n2. Break the sharp anchors with the scissor tool and delete
    the larger arc.\r\n\r\n2. Make two copies and rotate one of them 120\xB0 and the
    other -120\xB0.\r\n\r\n3. Move them into position and connect the anchors with
    Object > Path > Join.\r\n\r\n4. Rotate 30\xB0."

    my solutions you need two of the finctions - intersect and then combine.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Correction to step 1 above: creating a crescent shape is done with Pathfinder
    > Minus Front, not Intersect.\r\n\r\nWhatever method you use to create the shape
    with Pathfinder, I'm still pretty sure you'll have to manually break it apart
    and reassemble in order to get the single, continuous path the OP describes in
    his video.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text-on-triquetra_3553.png]"

  body: For that effect yes, he does. I thought he wanted the text to follow the edges
    of the shape. My mistake if he does not...
