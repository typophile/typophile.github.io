  Tabak"> <BR> <BR>A tobacco sign, which is obviously hand painted, so it seems, but
  maybe, hopefully, its at least roughly based on an existing type.? &#40; Any help
  and any hint appreciated.. &#41; <BR> <BR>Thank you, fellow Typophiles.. <BR>  '

    formal scripts&#41;. The closest I found was Admiral, an R. H. Middleton design
    from 1953. Type Revivals had it, but someone else provided my sample of it &#40;CybaPee,
    if any of you know her, from typOasis&#41;. Here is the sample she made: <BR><img
