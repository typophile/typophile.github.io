  body: Maria, at least sign in under your real name. We know who you  <BR>are, so
    there&#39;s really no need to hide behind phoney aliases.

  body: I don&#39;t hide behind any phoney aliases. Phlomis is the alias thas I use
    in internet and in my home mail. I use it in every forum that I post. <BR>If I
    have hidden, I wouldn&#39;t wrote my email with my real name. <BR>And, how I say
    before, if you don&#39;t want to help me, it&#39;s not necessary. It&#39;s a game,
    and if I don&#39;t identify the font, other person in the game can identify it.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for all.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for all.

    <BR> <BR>Do you share it with those who help?

  body: It&#39;s a bit difficult to explain. It&#39;s a game, like a city. In this
    city, there&#39;s a typographer, and every time, he show us a font, and we have
    to identify it. The different fonts make a place&#39;s name of the city, that
    we haven&#39;t discovered yet. <BR>It&#39;s that all. But, it&#39;s the last time
    that I post here, because, I think that you believe that I want to pirate, or
    something like that. For this reason, I don&#39;t want to post here anymore, I&#39;m
    not a criminal. I only play in a web game. <BR>Thanks for all. Bye.

    <BR>Well Maria, I hate to contradict you, but up till now you&#39;ve  <BR>always
    posted your ID requests under your own name, so  <BR>my remark stands.

    </i> <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t think you want to pirate fonts.  <BR> <BR>We just think
    it is not fair play to use someone else to help you win something. <BR> <BR>Especially,
    if you do not share what you win. <BR> <BR>Do you understand?

  body: Ok. I&#39;ve found the font. And I&#39;m sorry Mike, but I don&#39;t explain
    before. I share what I win, with people who play in the same game as me. <BR>It&#39;s
    Action Is, Shaded JL <BR> <BR>And Yvers, I agree with you, until now I&#39;ve
    always posted with my real name, but one month ago I started to post with my alias.  <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for all. And good bye, for the last time.

    <BR> <BR>Oh, I didn&#39;t explain well.I&#39;m sorry, my english is not so good.
    I don&#39;t win anything material, or something like that. Identifying fonts is
    for advancing in the game. It&#39;s all, nothing more. <BR>I&#39;m sorry if I
    have offended somebody. <BR> <BR>Thanks. Regards.
