  quite like to take a course to learn a bit about letterpress printing. I was wondering
  if any typophiles have been to (or even run!) any courses in London or SE England
  and could give me some recommendations?\r\n\r\nLooking around on the web, there
  are two lists, one on [[http://www.letterpressalive.co.uk/|Letterpress Alive!]]
  and one on [[http://britishletterpress.co.uk/printing-today/learning-more/letterpress-courses-and-tuition/|British
  Letterpress]] but a great many of those links seem to be out-of-date and many of
  the institutions or presses don\u2019t seem to be running anything anymore.\r\n\r\nSome
  possibilities include the [[http://printworkshop.stbridefoundation.org/|St Bride
  Institute]],  [[http://www.harringtonandsquires.co.uk/workshop.htm|Harrington and
  Squires]] and the [[http://inkspotpress.co.uk/|Ink Spot Press]] in Brighton but
  I wonder if there are any more which I haven\u2019t been able to find? I am fairly
  flexible about what I do (although I\u2019d prefer to work with metal type than
  polymer); as a complete beginner, I\u2019m mostly after a general introductory course.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n-Jacob"

    in SW9 should be offering, but doesn't...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typemuseum.org\r\n\r\nIf
    you're willing to come up to the Midlands, my students recommend the letterpress

  body: "Thanks for those replies. \r\n\r\nAndreas: no; I\u2019m not set on London,
    but as I live here I would of course prefer something nearby.\r\n\r\nRadioB: ouch...that
    seems a bit expensive! I wonder why the Central Saint Martins courses are so expensive?
    Even the lecture- or computer-based courses they run seem to be that price.\r\n\r\nBen:
    That\u2019s very interesting, and at reasonable costs (although I bet the cost
    of the train ticket will inflate it a lot); thanks!\r\n\r\nFrank: Thanks. I had
    seen that site before and must keep an eye on it in case they start advertising
    again.\r\n\r\n-Jacob"

  body: "There are indeed letterpress courses at St Bride as my letterpress co-conspirator
    is involved in setting them up. \r\nCheck out the St Bride library website or
    give them a call. As a letterpress printer of nearly eight years experience I
    would thoroughly recommend visiting for a workshop, and they can in turn put you
    in touch with someone who can help you to further develop your new inky skills.
    Happy printing"

    in going there. It''s just a shame the prices are so expensive: their evening
    course is a third longer than Leicester Print''s but nearly three times as expensive!'

  body: "Following the suggestions here, I spent this weekend at the St Bride Institute
    on an \u201Cintensive\u201D course run by Richard Lawrence which was excellent
    fun. Richard was very kind in allowing us pretty much a free rein to do / try
    everything we wanted and answered no end of questions thrown at him.\r\n\r\nWe
    started by doing some 1x1 inch lino prints on an Adana and proofing press and
    then moved on to setting and printing our names in type. That was followed by
    an attempt at a collaborative poster with a block of justified text decorated
    with some more lino prints, which ended up being a little over-ambitious and only
    just being completed at the end of the next day...\r\n\r\nApart from that, we
    all got on with printing other things that interested us: posters in large wooden
    type, business cards, dinner invitations, note-cards, beer mats and the like were
    all printed in increasingly dramatic colours, so I think I have a certain feel
    for the basics in quite a few areas, if not quite a detailed understanding of
    anything in particular.\r\n\r\nIf they continue to run these courses with about
    6 participants then St Bride Institute\u2019s print room provides plenty of space
    and enough presses for no one to have to wait too long to use anything. I was
    a little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t more metal type to play with, though
    there is a huge amount of Perpetua and enough Univers and Fourier to set most
    things in, along with lots of odds-and-ends of decorative type and scripts. There
    is also a great selection of old wooden type which is good for immediate gratification!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I would thoroughly recommend the course to any type fans. Line-spacing is so much
    more obvious now having deal with leading which was strips of lead, and it really
    made me understand why, for instance, so fewer fonts were used historically in
    any given document: each one you add means you have to get another case and it
    adds so much hassle! I also hadn\u2019t expected it to be so time consuming setting
    the type (and how easy it is to knock them over...), although you pick up the
    layout of the case pretty quickly and justification was much easier than I expected.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the results:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test1_6148.jpg]"
