body: "Hello!\r\nI tried a bunch of the suggestions and here's the next draft. Personally
  I like the new \"S\" and the \"ong\", but Goudy for \"Enriching Life through\",
  really bugs me. The clients typeface is Goudy Old Style, so I cannot change that
  one. Does anyone have any suggestions on the clumping of the title. Its just not
  working.\r\nThanks very much,\r\nKate"
