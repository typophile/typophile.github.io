  body: Try to get an outlined version in EPS format from  <BR>your neighbour, and
    don&#39;t use Remedy for the website. <BR>It&#39;s definitely not made to be read
    onscreen, and it  <BR>would dilute the impact of the &#34;brand&#34; if you used  <BR>too
    much of the same typeface in the vicinity of the  <BR>original logo.

  body: Wild guess -- he called it that because the designer wanted to honor Rudy
    VanderLans, so it was a combination of &#34;Rudy&#34; and &#34;me,&#34; but &#34;Rumedy&#34;
    sounded weird, so they settled on &#34;Remedy.&#34; Yeah, that sounds plausible.

    it was inspired by The Cure album designs? Although it&#39;s not clear exactly
    which album they are referring to. I can&#39;t find any on amazon that looks like
    it could&#39;ve inspired Remedy. <BR> <BR>
