  country/city/region, but that barely seem to be known elsewhere?\r\n\r\nFor instance
  (maybe because I'm keeping an eye out for it) here in Sweden, [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/boton/pro/|Boton]]
  seems to be in just about every other ad these days, yet I've never seen it anywhere
  else."

    (n\xE9e Lateinisch; H.Berthold, 1901). It was ubiquitous. This is what Allan Hutt,
    a great typographic expert and a devout communist, wrote about it, in total frustration:<blockquote><em>The
    survival of this De Vinne-style type, from the worst design period of old Imperial
    Germany, in the premier Socialist country in the latter part of the twentieth
    century, is a typographical phenomenon as unique as it is deplorable</em>.<dl>Allen
