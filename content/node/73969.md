  TTF hinting a font should need to have in order to be a good performer as webfon
  (and please do not tell me 'as much as possible' :) ). \r\n\r\nSpecifically I would
  like to know what tasks should be done after converting PS hints to instructions
  or on top of auto TTF hinting.\r\n(or maybe well done auto TTF in Fontlab or AFDK
  is enough?).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Hinting is a design process, so this question cannot be answered without first
    knowing for what kind of typeface and how that typeface is intended to be used,
    e.g. at what sizes.

  body: "Thanks for the answers.\r\n\r\nMy question aim to the fact that I always
    knew that good perfomance in screen was equivalent to high level TT hinting. Well,
    as we all know this work was in the hand of a limited group of people and the
    amount of hours was considerable to have something as good as 'Verdana'.\r\n\r\nWell,
    now we see foundries releasing fonts to be used in browsers by means of @font-face
    linking. \r\n\r\nSince I suspect these new fonts are not hinted to the level of
    Verdana, what sort of optimizations is being used or what not-so-deep level of
    hinting is now considered acceptable for 'webfonts'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Much that is good about Verdana has to do with it being designed to accommodate
    the pixel grid at small sizes.

    is also a lot in the way of intended use that a font developer might not bother
    to do because it wouldn't improve the appearance of an existing font on the web
    anyway."
