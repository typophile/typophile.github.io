  both look good but which one is actually the best? I'm talking geometry, proper
  digitization, inter-word spacing, and generally speaking perfection. Futura is just
  as close to perfection [the concept] as one can get right? I like Dresher and Super
  Grotesk too but these are missing small caps or ranging figures. And speaking of
  perfection- didn't Erik Spiekermann make a geometrically 'perfect' Futura for VW?
  \r\n\r\nAny other (similar) geometric sans I should consider?\r\nDTL Nobel is out
  my price range for the whole package though :-(\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

      about Futuras geometry is that it just isn't geometrically \"perfect\"\u2026
