  body: "I wonder if this could be hand-drawn. There is an unevenness in the letter
    heights that I wouldn't expect in a font, and I couldn't find this at a freebie
    site (where such things often show up).\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else recognizes it?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Quigley Wiggly has the same uneven x-height of  the 'a' and 'e', but Holly
    Script does not. The C is also strange in Holly but was cleaned up by Nick (maybe
    the URW version is messed up?).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Elise - You are ceratinly welcome.\r\n\r\nMike - I think that vertical line
    in the C is supposed to be consistent with similar thin vertical strokes in other
    caps. It's present in Dan Solo's Dover version as well as knockoffs. It does look
    odd in the C, though."
