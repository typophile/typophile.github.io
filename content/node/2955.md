  body: '&#62;some of the Gaudi buildings. <BR> <BR>Funny, yet of course sad, story.
    Gaudi was killed while building the Sagrada Familia. Apparently it was important
    to Gaudi that it face due east &#0150; hence, entirely disrupting the already
    established circulation &#40;auto, pedestrian&#41; patterns in that area. He was
    killed by an errant streetcar on its way through the newly wayward streets. Since
    Gaudi had been living at the site during its construction, no one recognized him
    &amp; everyone at the scene thought he was a homeless man. Consequently he was
    sent to the &#0145;people&#0146;s&#0146; hospice. As opposed to the decent hospital
    where the wealthy were taken. Upon finding out the situation, one of the bishops
    or something went to the hospice, but Gaudi refused to leave. There&#0146;s some
    famous quote which I can&#0146;t remeber along the lines of &#0145;I lived with
    the people &amp; I&#0146;ll die with the poeple.&#0146; Which of course he unfortunately
    did. '

  body: Sadly, that&#0146;s all I know of Barcelona. My brother related the story
    to me. I&#0146;ve emailed him however &#0150; if he has any suggestions for the
    city I&#0146;ll let you know.  <BR> <BR>There is a great diner just off the Planty
    in Krak&#0243;w called the Barcelona...

  body: 'It has been a lot of time without going to Barcelona, too long and no excuse,
    maybe this year... I have not very hot information but I hope these few and actual
    links can be useful in your trip: <BR> <BR>There are now two exhibitions in the
    <a href="http://www.museuartsdecoratives.bcn.es/home.htm" target=_top>Museu de
    les Arts Decoratives</a> about two catalanes designers, Oscar Tusquets and Carlos
    Vives, that might worth a look. <BR> <BR>You could take also a look at this <a
    href="http://www.adg-fad.org/news.php?pg=byid&amp;categ=4&amp;id=212" target=_top>one</a>
    and the site, can be interesting too. <BR> <BR>In Madrid <a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/madrid/"
    target=_top>La Guia del Ocio</a> is a  very useful link to know what is going
    on at the week in the city, in <a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/english/" target=_top>english
    too</a>, concerts, movies, exhibitions, etc. I don&#39;t now how it works the
    one from <a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/barcelona/" target=_top>Barcelona</a>,
    try it, here you have some <a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/barcelona/buscaarte/index.cfm"
    target=_top>exhibitions</a> for example, I can&#39;t find the english version
    for Barcelona though. In Madrid and in Barcelona &#40;I guess&#41; you can buy
    the print version more complete &#40;weekly&#41; at the Kioskos everywhere. <BR>
    <BR>Hope it helps a little. <BR> <BR>Buen Viaje! <BR>'

    which also looks a curious place to visit... and you don&#39;t have a picture
    of him in the agenda section of Maxalot. <BR>
