body: "I have had a few offers of translation for the Jim Rimmer film I am working
  on. I realize this would be of great benefit and have started transcribing the narrative
  of the film to see what will work best when the time comes for the final DVD and
  potential subtitles. Some of the concern is that technical type founding terminology
  may be tricky.  I was curious if anyone on this list is interested in helping out
  should we choose a wider variety of languages to subtitle with?\r\n\r\nA trailer
  for the film and an opportunity to help out (and get a not yet released Jim RImmer
  font and pre order the DVD) is on this kickstarter page\r\nhttp://kck.st/aTulSg\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nRK\r\n"

    use for actual captions (which \u2260 subtitles)."
