    of any importance to you.

  body: The Linotype/Adobe Stempel G has oldstyle figures either default-loaded (Linotype)
    or globally switchable in OpenType (Adobe OT); Bitstream has long been indifferent
    to oldstyle figures (Iowan and Arrus were given them only recently). That's the
    clincher for me; I would never use liner figures with any Garamond if I could
    help it.

  body: "<cite> > (Iowan and Arrus were given them only recently). </cite>\r\n\r\nThat
    may or may not be true for Arrus, but Iowan Old Style had oldstyle figures from
    the very start. Granted, they were not default in the U&lc fonts, being included
    in the Small Caps fonts instead. But this was a common enough arrangement in the
    days of its release, along the Adobe Expert model.\r\n\r\nJohn was very thorough
    in this design, including many characters that the old formats couldn't adequately
    accommodate (like Catalan l-dot-l, fully-composed Polish ogonek characters, Croatian
    dyet) and which all had to be off-loaded to an \"extension\" font. All available
    in the 2001 release. John and Dennis were ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\nYou may feel
    that Bitstream is \"indifferent\" to oldstyle figures, but you can't use Iowan
    Old Style as an example.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    there were no small caps/expert fonts in my family where oldstyle figures might
    have been found:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IowanB_6141.png]\r\n\r\nThat
    oldstyle figures were long a rarity for Bitstream is well known to anyone who
    shopped and bought from them, and this certainly applies to their versions of
    Garamond."

  body: "Thank you guys for all you comments. Unfortunately after going through all
    the Stempel Garamonds (and ilk) I found all digitizations  to be poor (Linotype)
    or incomplete (Bitstream). Most of the fonts I looked at had serious lapses in
    kerning. My favorite\u2014 \u201Cara\u201D as in garamond looks \u201Cgar\u201D
    and \u201Camond\u201D.\r\n\r\nI wanted something designed for text but crisp and
    \u201Csculptural\u201D enough to be used for occasional light-duty display work.
    \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve narrowed it down to Merlo, with Rongel and Verdigris also right
    there. I already have Minion and I\u2019m not a Sabon person.\r\n\r\nDid I miss
    anything?\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Loremipsum> Thank you again for your suggestions. Although I\u2019m even
    more sure than ever about going with Merlo, I\u2019m putting Corundum on my shopping
    list because its also super crisp, very well honed, and is an excellent value.\r\n\r\nFreight
    is also on my list but not anytime soon.\r\n\r\nClifford; I love, not crisp, but
    I love that one too. Akira Kobayashi said he would release an opentype version.
    I\u2019m waiting for that one.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m waiting for someone to do a serious
    learned reinterpretation of Kis. I like Tyrnavia very much. I just wish Gabor
    Kothay would come back to it and refine the kerning and perhaps the lowercase
    italic w. Also, improve diacritic placement. \r\nFont Bureau (Studio) has an interpretation
    of Kis. Very nice, but definitely suited to newspapers it doesn\u2019t have the
    left handed swashes in the lowercase italics (that I like) that would make it
    feel more literary.\r\n\r\nNexus is also on my list. Very crisp and kinda funky.\r\n\r\nBut
    Merlo for sure is happening. Although, I wish it had a bold.\r\n\r\nThank you
    all for your responses. This was helpful.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n"
