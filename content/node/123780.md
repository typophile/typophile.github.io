  for the captions. I've been using Bodoni MT Black for its rational construction
  and stroke contrast, but my boss thinks it's too high-contrast, and also wants me
  to try some lowercase.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Note that this will be 21\" wide.\r\n\r\n<a

    stability, such as Clarendon Text https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\r\nThis
    would contrast with the swirly thoughts in the sky impression conveyed by your

    sans?\" you might consider Globe Gothic from circa 1900 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LTCGlobeGothicAsThe_4286.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LTCGlobeGothicAsIs_6355.gif]

  body: "Thanks, donsho! I don't know how I skipped over Clarendon \u2014 somehow
    I tried Century and didn't make that jump to Clarendon.\r\n\r\nErasmus has a nice
    optimistic stoicism to it with the angled terminals.\r\n\r\nBookman always feels
    like the 70s to me, but maybe that's just the outsize influence of the ITC version.\r\n\r\nGlobe
    Gothic is a good thought, but I dunno, the digitized version looks so...digital.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thanks for all the help, y'all! We're hoping to send this thing into production
    next week and you've helped me get there. Look for it soon in your local purveyor
    of smart, funny gifts for smart, funny people."
