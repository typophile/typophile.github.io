body: "I thought some of you might enjoy this test I've created. It's not exactly
  typography-based besides the fact that each question has an answer that is one single
  character (letter, number, punctuation). Though some typographic knowledge <em>would</em>
  help.\r\n\r\nIf you take it, please post how far you get, I'd like to know if any
  of the questions are impossibly unfair.\r\n\r\nTake the <a href=\"http://www.philatype.com\">The
  Tough Characters Test</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I thought "A" was the first letter of the latin alphabet, but the quiz just
    flashes orange at me. apparently that implies that I'm wrong. hmmm.

    letter of the latin alphabet. It's asking for the first letter in Latin Alphabet. "
