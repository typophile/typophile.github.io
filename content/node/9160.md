body: I would like to know the type of font used at Martha Stewart&#39;s web site.
  In particular I am interested in the font used in the green graphic on the left
  of the top menu bar. Martha Stewart&#39;s name is written inside this green graphic,
  and I would like to be able to duplicate that look. I would appreciate any help.

  body: Prior to its recent redesign, Martha Stewart Living magazine used Benton Sans,
    which they commissioned from Font Bureau. I believe that&#39;s what&#39;s still
    being used on the web site. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans</a> <BR> <BR>News Gothic
    or Trade Gothic would be serviceable alternates.

  body: Do I have my stories mixed up, Tiffany? I could have sworn that Benton Sans
    was originally cooked up by Font Bureau for dual use by MSL and Worth magazines.
    <BR> <BR>Come to think of it though, the logo must have come first. ;&#41;

  body: No you aren&#39;t wrong. They only named it differently. When I was there
    that is what they were using .. MSL Gothic I mean, but it was from Font Bureau.
    I&#39;m sure they named it MSL to add more cache and ownability to it. :^&#41;
