body: "Michael Doret and [[http://www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/soup.html|Alphabet
  Soup]] would like to call your attention to the release of Deliscript Upright and
  Deliscript Slant.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Deli_Website_Splash_5605.jpg]\r\nAlthough
  Deliscript was initially inspired by the neon sign in front of Canter\u2019s Delicatessen
  in Los Angeles, the design of these fonts soon took on a life of its own\u2013and
  its own distinctive look. Like its sibling [[http://www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/metroscript.html|Metroscript]],
  Deliscript has many features that expand its usability such as the the variable
  length tails which can be accessed in 6 different styles, and the unique crossbars
  which can be extended outward in either direction from the \"t\" character. Throw
  in the special \"WordLogos\", tons of ligatures and foreign accented characters,
  and you have a recipe for typesetting that approaches the look of hand-lettering.
  This was only achieved with the very savvy technical assistance of Patrick Griffin
  of [[http://www.canadatype.com/|Canada Type]] who did all the OpenType encoding.\r\n\r\nDeliscript
  has just been released at [[http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-DESC|FontBros]].
  The 6 Page (1.7 MB) [[http://www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/Deli_OT_Manual.pdf|Deliscript
  User Manual]] may also be downloaded."
