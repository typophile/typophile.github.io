  destination. Our account managers and client seems to be under the impression that
  one can certainly not split a brand name over two lines, which I disagree with.
  I know it isn't ideal, but in a magazine literally full of brand names, I think
  its inevitable at some point. What are your thoughts on this, is this something
  you have dealt with before? Or have I just missed a very crucial typography memo?\r\n\r\nThe
  whole magazine is set in left aligned paragraphs, with no hyphenation. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAnders"

    Klein</em> is not a problem.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend finding a style manual that
    you all can agree on (<a href=\"http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org\">Chicago
    Style</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Manual_of_Style_and_Usage\">New

    or just plain words. My query is more regarding wether you can split a name over
    two lines if its very long. Say you have a brand name that consists of 5-6 names
    \u2013\_is it ok to have a line break between name 3 and 4?\r\n\r\nAnders"

  body: "When you say \"it's inevitable at some point\", do you mean it's inevitable
    that some broken brand names will slip past you? If you're using InDesign just
    apply the \"no break\" attribute to the names, and they will not break even if
    the text reflows later. Or better yet, create a character style for brand names
    and apply the \"no break\" attribute to the character style. You can also apply
    the \"no break\" attribute via the Find/Change command. \r\n\r\nBut of course
    you'll end up with some ugly line breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Anders \u2013\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much about breaking brand names, or
    any other kind of name. It's a ridiculous notion that names shouldn't be broken;
    doubly so when it's made-up brand names with intercaps. What I would avoid is
    breaking a name the <em>first</em> time it appears, if you can, especially if
    it's unfamiliar. I'd be much more comfortable (in an English-language context)
    breaking a name like \"Fitzwilliam\" or \"Jackson\" than, say, \"Ouellebecq.\"
    When you do have to break a name, just like any other word, break it at a logical
    place: \"Page[-]Maker\" (to take an actual brand name that is easy to hyphenate).\r\n\r\nI
    know you said you were eschewing all hyphens, but that sounds like an affectation.
    Even ragged-right copy needs words broken sometimes. It's important to keep in
    mind the difference between editorial decisions and typographic decisions. \r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n"

    are unacceptable, feel free to tell them to rewrite copy so that the prose does
    not result in bad typography. Most typographical problems can be edited away,
    but that is the editor's job, not the typographer's."
