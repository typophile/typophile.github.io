    - The Holy Tortoise\r\nKaganotsuki - The Moon over Kaga\r\nYukinone - The Sound
    of the Snow\r\nYamazaru - Mountain Monkeys\r\nEchigo Tsurukame - Crane and Turtle
    of Echigo\r\n\r\nThanks for the link Ian. It urges me to finally get around to
    designing and maybe translating some of my attemps at haiku. I so want to get
    to Japan someday.\r\n"
