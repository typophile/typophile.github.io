    to say thanks to everyone who puts in so much time and care, whether it is the
    kind folks at Punchcut, or the moderators, or the users."

    overseen by a group of thoughtful caretakers. We are very lucky to be here.

    spite of not being Christian, I really must say Amen to that! \r\n\r\nFYI: \"Amen\"
    is a Hebrew word meaning \"it is true,\" or \"so be it\"--exactly as you use it--and
    was part of Jewish liturgy for many centuries before Christianity came around.
    The word for faith, \"emunah\" is from the same root, as is the word for truth,
    \"emet\". "
