  body: "Jolene \u2013 it is most definitely <a/href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm\">Bliss</a>.
    They used to use Rotis and I'm immensely thankful that the corporate redesign
    (2002?) got rid of that one and replaced it with some quality. Something makes
    me think that Len Cheeseman was responsible for this, but I'm not sure. Ask around."
