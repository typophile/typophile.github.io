  to (and plays well with) Vector Battle: http://www.dafont.com/vector-battle.font\r\n\r\nIt
  needs to be another face that is reminiscent of the type used in old vector-based
  arcade games, like Battlezone: http://dropular.net/content/_fixed/y3j7t4bcve_Atari_BattleZone_Screenshot.gif\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated. Thanks."

    would be OK, but how about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/subcommunications/subedge/|Subedge]]?
    You can search on techno, or square techno. I'm assuming you already scanned the
    Dafont techno fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    make the most sense. Subedge looks like it might be a good fit. And yeah, I looked
    through the Tehno section of Dafont--not quite what I'm searching for. Want to
    stay away from pixel-style video game fonts. Thanks for the help!\r\n\r\n-Tim"

    href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html\">Gridnik</a>
    is also very nice, but not so much that early '80s aesthetic."
