  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Fellow Typophiles,

I've read an interesting story about good ol' Goudy. Making research about the unfortunate and talented Oz Cooper, I've learned that his teacher and mentor in type design was Frederic Goudy, and a few years after they parted their ways, when Cooper Black became a huge success, most of the competiting foundries made copies of this type, and of these replicas was made by... Frederic Goudy himself. Oz Cooper was quite bitter, tried unsuccessfully to protect his design, and finally died from cancer in 1940 at age 61.

does anyone know more about this? I'd like to learn.

		<div class="commentbody">David R, You said you read this story but didn't say where. Could you provide a source (online or printed)? I've been curious about the story since hearing it in the Cheshire Dave film which I agree is very funny and very clever.

However, the narrator's claim in the Cheshire Dave film never seemed right for the simple fact that the specific Goudy type (was it Pabst?) mentioned doesn't look at all like Cooper Black to my eye. It might be another. The lettering style is imitated all the time during the period. And guys, let's remember, plagiarism was rampant at the time (look at ATF and Koch, or Continental Type Foundry's [FWG's foundry type distributor in the 1930s] attempt to sue ATF in the 1920s) and designers (including Goudy) didn't get rich off their commercial designs. They made their money on private designs and book/advertising design.

I doubt the story made it into print in their day. Most of the nasty comments about Goudy found their way into private letters or unpublished talk. Rudolf Ruzicka's <cite>Speaking Reminiscently</cite> (Grolier Club, 1986)([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/13803244|cite]]) mentions his own break with FWG over a portrait--it was Goudy's egotism that irritated RR. (The unedited tapes are held by the Club but FWG warrants only two short mentions.) Morison and Updike wrote snidely about G in their private correspondence (but then they also were a bit snide about Bruce Rogers too). If you don't have <cite>The Book of Oz Cooper</cite> (STA, 1949) ([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/41547813|cite]]), you should look at it. I think RH Middleton also has a Cooper book ([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/34637591|cite]]). Not much published on him outside the Chicago area. You might check with current Chicago-area AIGA members and such. A number of old-timers knew Middletown and had heard stories from them, but not being in Chicago, I've never tried to get the stories.

The Goudy type in question would be Goudy Heavyface. Goudy recalls in his "Half Century of Type Design" that this type of heavy black face held little appeal to him but that Harvey Best of Lanston Monotype was "obsessed" with releasing one...most likely to compete with Cooper Black. As far as forgery, theft or inspired mimicry, you decide, here they are for comparison.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I remember <em>Letters of Credit</em> correctly (which I may not), Walter Tracy much prefers Goudy Heavyface to Cooper Black, calling most of the other faces inspired/ripped-off from Cooper Black "obscene." I think I concur that Goudy's version has its own merits: it feels a lot closer to "traditional" type (almost like a crazy, extra black weight) compared to Cooper's, which gives me a more independent vibe.</div>

It has a different relaxed appeal and perhaps less broad usage. Goudy fills more usefulness categories and is just better crafted.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that they are significantly different. 

To me Goudy Heavyface is not as good a typeface, even though it very well executed--maybe better than Cooper Black. The problem is that it is neither here nor there. It has the fat and soft look, but without the distinctive charm of Cooper Black. What is great about Cooper black is those endearing bulbous serifs and terminals--while still the face still has a strong spine, unlike Hobo or Souvenir. So yes, Goudy Heavyface could be used in more categories, but who wants to? You probably have better alternatives. But if you want something bold but cute, which is in demand in advertising, then there you have Cooper Black smiling at you. It has won the popularity contest with Goudy Heavyface and I think you can see why. 

Chris, I disagree with you that Goudy is 'more crisp', as it is still quite soft. For a charming fat face that is more clean and crisp, we are awaiting the heavy weight of your "Froggy," which you have shown in the Critique threads. Now that will give Cooper Black some real competition! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the other hand -- speaking as a dilettante type observer -- Goudy's perpetuates the distinctive visual voice of its designer, so although it was evidently occasioned by Cooper Black, and clearly draws on Cooper's notion of a rounded, fat display face, the term "thief" seems wildly inappropriate. All the more so, in the pre-digital era.</div>

Whoa! The "Book of Oz" cover looks bizarrely similar to the old Lutheran hymnal I grew up with!

Also, i didnt realize, but the Robert Crumb allusion is indeed quite pertinent...

I'll look into that as well.

Kegler, I think I understand that you hace a copy of the Book of Oz Cooper. If yes, would it be possible for you to scan the image that was posted above? Is there another example of such a handwtiting in the book?

"The old fellows stole all our best ideas!"

Once a typeface from foundry A took off, suddenly foundry B, C and D wanted one "just like it". No mystery that Goudy was asked to mimic other popular faces. What I think is interesting is the kind of solution Goudy came up with; it satisfied the brief but clearly shows his individual style. Another face in this category is Kompakt, a very bold roman by H Zapf. It also looks similar on a superficial level, but has all kinds of personal style in it. That's fascinating. </div>

But seriously think about the context. This isn't text type. It's ad type. To me Cooper black is genius. I really don't like the feeling/style that much but I admire what he has going on very much. To my eye that genius is missing in the Goudy. The sheer integration of the elements in Cooper Black is fantastic. And look at the things he gets away with. The lower case o for instance. But it works!</div>
