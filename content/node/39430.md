  your letters out with french curves, circle/ellipse templates, etc, or do you just
  work out a nice curve freehand and replicate it with tracing paper?

  body: I usually don't usually draw very tight on paper anymore, but even when I
    do, I don't use curve templates. Before I used computers, I used them all the
    time. I would say I stopped using curve templates about the same time I started
    using computers for drawing letters. It was a very tedious and limited way to
    draw and I don't miss it.

  body: At most I'll use a ruler, compass, and ellipse template, but why bother depending
    on the French for curves when we can reap the benefits of the Quaker space program
    instead?
