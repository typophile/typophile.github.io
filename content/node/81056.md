  part of a metrics class) in the Kerning palette of the Metrics Window distract me,
  so I can't as easily see where the kerning problems are.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to
  turn off the blue characters?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThanks,\r\nSv."

    (Metrics Window - Metrics Window Colors) \u2013 just change it to black or a very
