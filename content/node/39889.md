  art exhibition called Sideshow. The main type will be set with JFRingmaster and
  the flyer will resemble an old circus poster, with portraits of the four artists.
  I'm really keen to find some graphics or a font with oval ornament frames for the
  portraits (they're all dressed up too), but I'm having trouble doing so. Can anyone
  help me?\r\n\r\nThanks from Louise\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sideshow_6054.gif]"

    of websites with stuff similar to what you are looking for, if I understand the
    question correctly...?
