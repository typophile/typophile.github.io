  iPhones. What\u2019s your stance on it? OK as long as you don\u2019t sell it and
  you own the license? I feel like the risks for losses due to copyright infringement
  would be minimal, since all the metrics and UPM size are different for the iPhone,
  making them not viable for print or commercial use anymore."

    it as long as you aren\u2019t sharing it or selling it. If you have purchased
    it legally, then I fail to see how it harms the author.\r\n\r\nFrom a musician\u2019s
    standpoint, as long as someone pays for my songs, I don\u2019t care if he puts
    them on his ipod, records them to minidisc, edits them to play backwards, presses
    them into vinyl, etc. As long as it\u2019s for personal satisfaction only, it
    wouldn\u2019t bother me."

    to use it as described in said license. Whether or violating the license harms
    the author is irrelevant. Whether or not it wouldn\u2019t bother you to have someone

    and proceeded to rationalize your own.\r\n\r\nHonestly, piracy on the iphone is
    a valid concern, there are a number of font hacks on Cydia that seem to include
    copies of commercial fonts. I've played around with porting my own fonts onto
    the iphone and you'd be surprised by how very few change need to be made. \r\n\r\nIf
    you're really into hacking and skinning your phone and actually do care about
    doing it \"correctly\" you should check your font\r\ns EULA to see if it allows
    re-engineering and installing on additional devices. If it doesn't, contact the
    foundry, explain what you want to do, and ask for permission. "

    your thoughtful response and suggestion. You are correct about how easy it would
    be. I\u2019m in the process of skinning my phone, and if I decide it\u2019s worth
    changing the font, I will contact the foundry and explain my situation. \r\n\r\nMichel,
    thanks for sharing your research. However, I wonder if that license agreement
    allows for necessary modifications to font metrics to make it compatible with
    the device.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I would have to agree with both you and aluminum.
    Especially if the license permits installation on 5 computers, it would be comparable
    to burning your songs to CD for your car."
