  body: Do you mean the masthead or the other font? Masthead is a Didot, probably
    custom for Vogue. The other looks like a Caslon probably.

  body: I thought Caslon 540 too but the roman especially looks lighter than that
    - maybe a custom Vogue Caslon based on 540?

  body: I've got a copy of Vogue Paris right here, and a comparison with Caslon 540
    reveals some minor differences, but the base is undoubtedly 540.

    thoughts and ended up not posting because I wasn't sure what the deal was, didn't
    think a custom face would be used for headlines."

    for both headline and body copy. It can be frustrating because they are often
    very beautiful and yet not commercially available. See below, for example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/profile/clients.html"

  body: yes, it's unfair, I asked a similar question regardign The New York Times
    Magazine and recieved a similar answer. Bummer, they always seem to be just a
    little bit better than what i can get my hands on.

  body: TL, I would say that Caslon 540 is practically identical to the Vogue Paris
    font, so if you're going for that look, you would do very well with it.

    of beautiful fonts that are available commercially!

  body: "hi !\r\n\r\nI urgently need to find out the font use around the 1980's in
    Vogue Paris (when the magazine was under Colombe Pringle direction). \r\nSpecifically,
    I want to ID the typeface used on 1989 covers - does anyone know what this is??\r\n\r\nI've
    uploaded a couple of images of what I'm referring to.\r\n\r\nIf I am lucky enough
    that someone knows - please could you also inform me where I might download/buy
    it?? \r\n\r\nThanks!!! \r\n\r\n"
