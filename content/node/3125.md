body: I posted at Adobe in their forums but I thought I&#39;d roll the dice and see
  if any of my fellow typophiles have experienced the same thing. <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42;
  &#42; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve created some files in Illustrator CS. I&#39;d like to give
  them to my client to use in Illustrator 8 ... they are basically templates. When
  I export them as legacy files all the type breaks into separate letters. I did try
  to create a text box thinking that perhaps that would work but it didn&#39;t. I&#39;m
  neither all-knowing nor all-seeing so I&#39;m hoping you might have an idea or suggestion
  for me. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: There&#39;s a whole long thread about this on the Adobe forums, entitled &#34;the
    new text engine&#34; or something like that. It explains this stuff in some detail.
    <BR> <BR>I believe the short answer is that backwards compatibility is limited
    in this way, and it&#39;s one of the sacrifices they had to make to get to the
    new text engine. <BR> <BR>T

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I love the new text engine so I wouldn&#39;t
    trade that for anything. I&#39;ll just have to give my client all the fiddly numbers
    and a file with guides of where to start their text boxes.
