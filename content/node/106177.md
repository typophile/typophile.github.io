    body: No it's not the actual signature, should've been more clear. We took the
      original signature and played with the lines a bit.

  body: Sorry, but it looks very unprofessional. Lines too thin, widths too uneven,
    doesn't hold together. It does look like autotrace.

    logo doesn't have to be the person's real signature; it fact due to identity theft
    it's probably not a good idea. Here's Walt Disney's real signature and his logo

    body: 'Thanks, JamesM, for your constructive criticism. I''m having a hard time
      with this because the person I working on this logo for doesn''t want to take
      the time to create a font out of his signature, and isn''t a fan of many signature
      fonts. I think this logo is a bust and should start fresh with another idea. '

  body: That sounds like probably a good idea, especially if the client isn't on board
    with the idea. Good luck!
