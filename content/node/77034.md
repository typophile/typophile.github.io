    by Coca-Cola, Qwest, Starbucks, Yahoo!, Rite Aid, Banana Republic, Crest, The
    Discovery Channel, Inception, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOh well. Best of luck finding
    it.\r\n"

    font\" and no luck there. Maybe try contacting the Obama family? I think their
    address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I'm sorry we've let you down.\r\n"
