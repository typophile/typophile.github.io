  a daughter and she would like a plaque also. I would like to use the same fonts,
  but after a long frustrating search, I can't seem to find the right ones. I've found
  a lot that are similar, but not the exact ones, especially on the first name. Can
  anyone help? I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."

    the last 4 years, and have not had one complaint from anyone. I usually save everything
    with different layers so I can edit just names, but for some reason I didn't do
    it with this one. Unfortunately, there is no way to do this kind of plaque the
    way it is without \"squooshing\" it, and I will continue to do so. I appreciate
    your help in figuring out the fonts, really I do, but I really could have done
    without the pety guilt trip over a distorted typeface. I'm wondering why it matters
    to you, a complete stranger on the internet, what I do. Anyways, again, thanks.
    I definitely won't be using this service again if I am going to be attacked. Take
    care."

    advice as an attack. \"R.\" went to some length to explain why it matters to people
    who care about type that it be used in the way it was designed to be used. Of
    course you are free to disregard that advice, since you are making a product for
    people who don't have interest in the type as such.\r\n\r\nI would like to think
    they could learn though, to appreciate good typography if they saw it more often.
    \r\n\r\nThanks \"R.\" for reminding us about the craft that goes into good type
    design, not that it's all good. It's why many of us are typophiles in the first
    place.\r\n\r\n-Mike Yanega"

  body: "It matters to me because I like type. This is why I occasionally try to convince
    others to work with type in a way that honours the typefaces and their designers\u2019
    intentions. Creating a quality typeface involves a well-thought-out decision on
    the thickness of the letters. The designer tries to give horizontal and vertical
    lines a stroke width that is both pleasing to the eye and easy to read. \u2018Squooshing\u2019
    letters, i.e. scaling them non-proportionally, will always destroy this fine balance
    between horizontals and verticals because you only change the thickness of one
    of the two. This is not what type designers wanted their designs to look like.
    If one of your designs featured a photograph of a baby, you would probably be
    loath to stretch the picture as much as the letters you used. It\u2019s technically
    possible and to a certain degree, strangers might not even notice the distortion
    in the photograph (just as they don\u2019t in type), but this is not what parents
    want their babies to look like.\r\n\r\nSo what could you do differently? I would
    suggest that you try to find typefaces that match the width of the space that
    you have to fill. There are designers who create particularly narrow or wide letters
    (compare, for instance, Arial to Arial Narrow). You would not have to squoosh
    these typefaces (as much as the ones you used) to get the intended effect. Below
    is an example of what this might look like. I am not saying this is finished work,
    but I want to demonstrate that it is possible to create the look you want without
    distorting letters. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/univers/All/All/Bestsellers/2\">Univers</a>,
    which I have used for this example, is a typeface that you would have to pay for
    (if you are interested, follow the link). But there are free quality fonts that
    you could use just as well. Look around on sites like Google Fonts or Fontsquirrel.
    <a href=\"http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed\">Roboto Condensed</a>,
    <a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans+Narrow\">PT Sans Narrow</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans-condensed\">OpenSans
    Condensed</a> are typefaces that you might like. And if you are looking for more
    advice, try Typophile\u2014unless you still feel attacked by some well-meaning
    hints.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_6061.png]"
