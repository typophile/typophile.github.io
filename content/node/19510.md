body: I've been working with the logo for my own design company and as all designers
  know these things are rarely completely finished.  The company is pronounced like
  brotherhood and is made up of real brothers and brothers from different mothers.
  I haven't settled a typeface yet, I've been using amerika sans.  The icon is simple
  and works off the ulauted U. I am having a bit of trouble with the word design.
  Let me know what you all think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bhud_logo.jpg]

  body: "I think the proportions between the mark and the type need to be worked out
    a little more, and I think the mark is a bit too large. The tracked out \"d e
    s i g n\", I think needs to go or be re-worked, this sort of type configuration
    has been done many times but I think it works better with a longer word that does
    not have to be tracked out this much. I think the typeface can work but perhaps
    carry over some of the thick and thin relationships as seen in the \"u\" and other
    letters into the mark so that its less monotone in weight.\r\n\r\nPerhaps try
    reducing the size of the mark and maybe something a little more assymetric and
    its arrangement may turn out a more dynamic.\r\n\r\nI don't post that often, and
    I am just a student; There are some people here that I am sure could give you
    a much more detaled critique but I hope this is somewhat helpful!"

  body: "i actually read the icon as two people kissing.. but maybe its just me..
    \r\n\r\ni agree with Thomas on the proportion issue.. \r\n\r\nmayb you could play
    some with the umlaut U in the actual type, in conjunction with your mark. ie,
    try replacing the umlaud U with the mark you already have, or portions of it,
    and play with that.. \r\n\r\nthe kerning on this version as opposed to the one
    on the site is alot better btw..\r\n\r\nim curious as to why you chose to go with
    the umlauted brotherhud, instead of just plain old 'brotherhood' ?"

  body: I appreciate all the comments.  I will definitely work on the proportions,
    I agree with that.  We decided to change the spelling in order to give it our
    own definition.  Brotherhood is used in so many places and contexts.  We wanted
    to set ourselves apart a bit.  The type isn't nearly done.  We liked the symmetry.  The
    two figures share heads/thoughts, almost become one.  And actually together, they
    do make one symbol.  An equal amount of people saw the two figures facing each
    other as they did facing apart. Most people saw the umlaut U before they even
    saw two figures though.

  body: 'I thought I''d chip in - on first glance it looks like 2 figures kissing
    to me. To me the mark seems almost redundant, I like the wordmark on it''s own.
    Also the r and o seem to be too far apart. '

  body: 'I think the word design is tooooooo letter-spaced. The size relationship
    is nice however. I''d also second Duckworth. I''d save the mark for different
    uses. I''d not use these two together. '

    faces)\r\n2.  A toilet seat viewed from above (dark circles are hinges)\r\n\r\nBut
    the typeface has me intrigued."
