  book for my sophomore portfolio review and I'm trying to find distinguishing characters
  for twenty typefaces. I've been having some trouble finding information on some
  of the typefaces, so I turn it to you. I need at least 5 distinguishing characters
  for each, preferably in Roman or Regular, and why they distinguish the typeface.
  I'm thinking that I'm going to use Q in all of my designs, because almost every
  Q is different and special. I just need help with the why it is special and wording
  it appropriately.\r\n\r\nTypefaces I still need information for:\r\nITC Cheltenham\r\nBerkeley
  Oldstyle\r\nInterstate\r\nMinion\r\n\r\nand a few others I haven't researched just
  yet, so not sure if there is or isn't information. Will update accordingly."
