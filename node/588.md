body: I need to add a single cyrillic word into a manuscript I&#39;m working on, but
  alas, the typeface I&#39;m using &#40;ITC Quay Sans Book&#41; has no cyrillic version.
  So, I&#39;m forced to cludge. Can someone looks this over and let me know if I&#39;ve
  bolloxed it up? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/12813.jpg"

  body: For a kludge, this isn&#39;t too bad. You have not made the <i>el</i> too
    rectangular, which is the usual beginner mistake. You could make the left, curved
    stem even more diagonal if you wanted to. To balance with the <i>a</i> this form
    needs to be a little bit wider. <BR> <BR>The width of the capital <i>Pe</i> should
    be slightly narrower than the Latin <i>H</i>. <BR> <BR>The <i>ya</i> is the trickiest
    letter you need to deal with. The head must be larger, try to balance it optically
    with the counter of the <i>a</i>. Of course, this means that the whole letter
    needs to wider, and the leg shorter.

  body: John&#39;s the expert on the forms, but I&#39;d point out that the spacing
    needs work too. <BR> <BR>Plus if you&#39;re willing to break from the Modernist
    doctrine of bland uniformity, you might make the &#34;a&#34; different than the
    original Latin one, perhaps by giving it more rigidity, like a straight middle
    join. That would be classy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Sean, the updated version is much improved. I would very slightly shorted
    the foot of the <i>el</i> and make the interior space just a little bit wider.
    You can still make the left left a bit more diagonal if you want. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    the spacing, can you provide some more context so we know how tightly spaced your
    Latin text is going to be?

  body: 'This is totally tangential, but it hit me hard enough that I&#39;d like to
    share it: <BR> <BR>If Cyrillic is effectively  more &#34;uppercase&#34; than Latin,
    maybe Cassandre wanted to reform Latin to regain its majuscule majesty &#40;via
    Peignot&#41; in large part because he was originally Russian? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
