    services</a>  I really like your way of expressing the opinions and sharing the
    information. <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Services
    for recruitment</a>  It is good to move as chance bring new things in life, paves
    the way for advancement, etc. But it is well known to everyone that moving to
    new location with bulk of goods is not an easy task to move or shift from one
    place to other place because I have experienced about that and I face the problem
    like that.  <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Employment
    services</a> There I go to village near to my city faced that problem there.

    any interesting subject related to this theme that I can research about and write

  body: "Shivat,\r\nby historical reasons members of this forum are somewhat sensitive
    when postings like yours (the 1st one) appear. Look what you\u2019ve written:
    \r\n\u201Cthe topic i had in mind was about history of newspaper typography, any
    suggestion?\u201D\r\n\r\nYou state that you have something in mind and then you
    ask for *any suggestion*. \r\nThis is not the same as describing one\u2019s work
    (!) and asking for help with *that*.\r\n\r\nDo your own work yourself first an
    then you\u2019ll find lots of friends here to help you. You\u2019ll also find
    out by time that, the more specifically you ask, the more substancial responses
    you may get.\r\n\r\nAnyway, *welcome to Typophile."

    are related to New York Times typeface and its changes over time. So I will do
    my research from those books and some documentaries about printing industry and
    newspapers.So I'm on the right track now. I really appreciate your comments and

  body: Shiva, the problem was that your question was vague and seemed to indicate
    that you hadn't worked on the project much yet. You'll get better responses if
    you ask specific questions, such as "Can you recommend any books on this topic?".
    Or by asking specific questions after you've done some research.
