  such as content chunking, production, layout etc. \r\n\r\nand i have selected 'METROPOLIS'.
  It talks about architecture and design. I was able to figure out the content distribution,
  i have\r\n\r\nobserved a proper margin through the articles but somehow im not able
  to see a grid or proper guides. \r\n\r\nwhether its follows a two column or a three
  column grid, or its too flexible to follow a grid. so basically im stuck with the
  most\r\n\r\nimportant criteria to analyse the magazine.\r\n\r\nill be soon posting
  scans of the magazine, the issue that im studying is (july/august 2007)\r\n\r\nmy

  body: "<em>i have an assignment</em>\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't sound too harsh,
    but if this is a school assignment, then you shouldn't be asking others to answer
    your questions for you. You won't learn anything that way, and you'll only be
    cheating yourself in the long run. Go and get some books on grids and layout (and
    there are plenty out there) and study them... then go back to your issue of Metropolis
    magazine and look at it again -- you may see things in a different light.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck,\r\nR."
