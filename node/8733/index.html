<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Aren't we visual communicators? <br> <br>If we take the definition of artist, "a person whose creative work shows sensitivity and imagination", then yes I would say I'm an artist. But isn't it kind of loaded to use the term artist? Should communication come before art? I suppose you could say "communications artist" but that sounds loaded too. I would think that "sensitivity and imagination" is assumed of all people that are creative and part of the problem, err I mean reason, of why they persued a career in the creative world. I suppose this is my knee-jerk reaction to someone who says, "noooo, I am an artiste!"</div>

<div class=commentbody>didn't you answer your own question with the question itself? if you're a designer, why call yourself anything else? i think that the term designer captures the meaning of "problem solver" better than artist does without losing the notion of creativity and imagination. <br> <br>but then again... words are just words and really have no other meaning than what we attach to them, so you could call yourself anything you wanted and (to you) it will mean precicely what you want it to mean.

<div class=commentbody><i>Aren't we visual communicators?</i> <br> <br>In application, that is often a very bogus term, since much of what graphic designers do is not communicative at all; it is at most evocative and even then tends toward the hopeful rather than the proveable: one hopes that the choice of colour and arrangement of elements <i>suggests</i> something to the viewer that will evoke the desired response. This is not communication. Communication is the transfer of an <i>idea</i> from one mind to another, measurable by the accuracy of the transmission. Despite the barrage of visual imagery in our society, the vast majority of communication is still linguistic, either verbal or literary. The only true 'visual communicators' are people who work with information design systems, which codify mental concepts using symbolic equivalents.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>measurable by the accuracy of the transmission&lt; <br>Communication occurs whether it is measurable or not. Just because it is easier to measure word transmissions does not mean they communicate any more effectively than visual transmissions. As humans, we tend to give greater value to things we can easily measure. We call this data so it sounds oh so scientific. We don't want to point out the shortcomings of the human race so we ignore things we have no data for. One day when we are smart enough to figure out how to measure more abstract things, they will suddenly become valuable. Until then we just focus on only the data we have been smart enough to collect. Was it as easy to measure the communication that took place in the nonverbal video of the Rodney King incident? Not easy to measure. Was there visual communication taking place? You dag gum betcha.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You should call yourself what you feel you are - and that's the most you <i>can</i> do. <br> <br>Nothing exists in a pure state - so nobody is totally an artist or totally anything. That said, it's highly useful -and necessary- to consider <i>concepts</i> as being pure. For example pure Art is when you create something motivated only by the need to express yourself - which of course never actually happens. But there is some Art in any act of design. The key thing though is that -for the act to cross a certain threshold into Design- this need to express has to be an unintended, or at least an undirected, force, emanating inescapably from your human-ness, sort of <i>in spite</i> of yourself. For example, if you make an upright Italic simply because you've "always wanted to", or if you believe that design comes from the urge to create, then you're being mostly an Artist; mostly selfish. Design comes more from a desire to <i>serve</i>. <br> <br>> we tend to give greater value to things we can easily measure. <br> <br>Very true. Especially in the West. <br>"If you can't count it, it doesn't count." <br>Totally bogus, duh. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>'art' or 'Art'? <br> <br>The difference is really one of intent and tradition. I'm sure we all know what the difference is. When I make a painting, even a digital one, it is Art (or fine art (it doesn't have to be good to qualify)), the making of a fine peice of design is an art. If your the making of your designs is an art then you are a good designer, if your paintings hang in a gallery you are an artist. <br> <br>John, <br> <br>>"There is no grammar of visual imagery, there is no syntax, there are no rules of morphology: there is nothing in it that makes language language." <br> <br>I have to disagree with you. Of course it all depends on the definition of the word language, but assuming it means something along the lines of a system of comunication that is agreed upon by the group of people that use it, then images certainly have a linguistic properties, with a full grammer and syntax. <br> <br>Taking line drawings as an example. What does the line represent? In simple line drawings, it is commonly agreed (it's grammer) that a line represents an edge or division. This is arbitrary, it is a social construct. <br> <br>Conventions of perspective are another grammer of imagery. From full on renaisance three point perpsectives, to cubism, to simple drop shadow. They are all grammers necessary to show how objects ought to be arranged by our mind when we percieve the image. Perhaps analagous to word order in a sentance. <br> <br>I would go on to argue that nearly all qualities of images are subject to conventions such as these. Even in photographs. Even the use areas of light or dark colours to show shadows and highlights. This is essentialy linguistic, in that they need to be agreed before being understood. <br> <br>Abstract painting is intersting in this respect, but I would say subject to the same rules. Abrstact Expressionism seems to me to have been built on a fraud, at least as far as its emotional content is concerned. <br> <br> <br>Ed. <br> <br>ps. I hope that makes sense. I wrote my dissertation on this, but am several thousand kilometers from my books at the moment. I've been a lurker for a while on these forums and have learnt a lot, but now I've decided to jump in...</div>

<div class=commentbody>more decon: <br> <br>like visual symbols, words are just signs that make reference to things and ideas without actually being connected to them in any way beyond the connections that we give to them. If you called me a gazelle, i'd hafta laugh, i'm not that fast; if you called me a cornflake i may be offended because i can be a bit flighty... one of the greatest features of symbols is that they don't mean "exactly" anything. there is a certain amount of "play" where a symbol can be more literal or more figurative. <br> <br>Words can be just as arbitrary as visual symbols. In a class on lanugage and culture the story was told of a fire that was started in a factory that all began when a sign was misread that said "Empty Gas Drums". Knowing the outcome, i'm sure you know what that meant, but those at the factory understood an entirely different meaning. <br> <br>John, i think it's humorous that you're championing language as a superior communicator of ideas in a thread that is basically an argument between the meaning of (verbal) terms. <br> <br>I am fascinated by verbal language. I believe there's good reason to call the study of it language arts. i think it's beautiful to be able to choose words as an artist would choose her pallette to convey different shades of meaning, but in the end it is the reader who decides what the text means, no matter what the author intended it to mean. <br> <br>that's why i think making a distinction between "designer," "artist," "communicator," etc. is bunk. to me. these terms overlap but have slightly different meaning, but you could choose any one and i think i would get the general understanding of what you are trying to convey - so call yourself what you want.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> 'visual language' ... is spectacularly unreliable. <br> <br>But "formal" language is simply less so; the difference is not qualitative. <br>Anyway, it seems the disagreement here is largely terminological. <br> <br>> Language, on the other hand, allows us to describe experience, <br>> and so to set contexts of understanding and response. <br> <br>But it can't really communicate emotion either. <br>In <i>any</i> case it's all in our respective heads. <br> <br>> The claims in favour of visual communication have always been overstated. <br> <br>With that I agree.

<div class=commentbody>I avoid it scrupulously. I've found that the term 'artist' carries connotations that are counter-productive, particularly in client relationships. I make a very brief, pleasant "I prefer the term 'graphic designer'. I believe it's more accurate." Then it's up to them if they want more explanation, which is a good opportunity to let them know I do more than make pretty things (not to say that's what an artist <i>is</i>, just how the term is perceived by many business clients). <br> <br>It's everyone's choice, but there's reason the question even exists.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I have to disagree with you. Of course it all depends on the definition of the word language, but assuming it means something along the lines of a system of comunication that is agreed upon by the group of people that use it, then images certainly have a linguistic properties, with a full grammer and syntax.</i> <br> <br>But that is a very superficial definition of language that completely ignores the seminal importance of language in cognition and self-consciousness. Language, to a very large extent, makes us what we are as human beings, while visual arts at most contribute to what we are as members of particular cultures. So, above, Bill makes some comments about associations with colour, e.g. death, marriage, but these are specific cultural associations, and make even this level of 'visual communication' increasingly problematic in multicultural societies. <br> <br><i>John, i think it's humorous that you're championing language as a superior communicator of ideas in a thread that is basically an argument over the meaning of (verbal) terms.</i> <br> <br>That's not nearly so humourous as the idea that we might have such an argument without words, but this is what the fantasy of 'visual communication' would suggest: that I could post a graphic that would make a point, and all the rest of you would post graphics making contrary points and refining previous graphics, and that this would constitute a conversation in a sense even remotely similar to our verbal exchanges. Because communication is not limited to a one-way transmission of information from source to recipient: it is the beginning of dialogue. One-way communication is the specialty of totalitarian and other repressive regimes, which it should be noted, favour visual and emotive media -- notably film and television -- over the textual and the reasoned (books, newspapers, journals, Internet discussion groups). <br> <br>One-way transmission is also, of course, the primary characteristic of television and of most advertising, which assumes an unequal relationship between the power of the seller to persuade and the inability of the consumer to resist or even question whether he actually needs the product. This is the sort situation in which 'visial communication' is effective: the manipulation of emotive response, usually ending in a credit card transaction. And this is why I do not consider it true communication, because ideas are actually anathema to the process, because ideas are generative and lead to other ideas, especially in the context of dialogue, while advertising and totalitarianism only want to put <i>one</i> thought in the recipient's mind: buy this, assent to this....</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, using the term 'visual communicator' may help you sell your services to clients, for whom 'communication' sounds more valuable than 'making you look better': in which case, more power to you. Call yourself whatever you want if it will convince people to pay you properly to do your work, but how you think of yourself should be a matter of critical consciousness, and probably won't be reducible to a tidy label.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to say that I'm glad I asked the question. Thanks for all the responses. I'll respond again later. <br> <br>But just quickly, in regards to John's recent post: John I am anti-label actually. Your remarks about why "visual communicator" isn't valid makes sense to the left side of my brain, but my right side has turned a deaf ear. Paul used the term "problem solver". I think that covers it best as it doesn't limit me simply to design, but could also include management, cleaning services, lunch coordinator, receptionist, typesetter, IT, and seat warmer. I wear too many hats to have one title and so try to avoid any title at all. Unless I'm joking around and then I call myself "Design Goddess". <br> <br>The question, the original post, came about because of a remark someone with whom I was chatting made. They made it sound as if they were an "artiste" and as a reaction I laughed. Turns out I misunderstood them, but I had already started the thread.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I've been arguing, perhaps over-strenuously, against 'visual communication' because I think it is something that too many people take for granted without really analysing, and also because I believe language is of an order of communication many times more sophisticated, more adaptable, more generative, than anything possible in visual, non-linguistic modes. But this is in part because the kind of communication that interests me is communication of <i>ideas,</i> and I'm quite strict that communication, properly understood, requires a significant identity between the message broadcase and the message received, which I don't think is reliable in visual media: heck, it is often difficult enough with language, which is why most effective communication involves a two-way transmission that clarifies meaning via discourse. <br> <br>There is, obviously, a common and less rigourous use of the term 'communicate' that is often applied to the <i>impression</i> that we get from a visual cue, such as a particular arrangement of form and colour in design, a gesture or facial expression, or, as Hector notes, the way someone is dressed. I think Erik Spiekermann is correct when he says 'We cannot not communicate', <i>if</i> that is understood to mean 'We cannot not create an impression'. And most graphic design is about creating impressions (often false ones, it must be said). Impressions are important: what psychologists call 'thin-slicing', rapid intuitive judgement or inductive reasoning based on very short exposure -- the proverbial first impression that is often correct -- is an important method for navigating through life. And what is characterised as 'visual communication' is an attempt to exploit this method by creating specific impressions, usually based on cultural associations. But I still don't think you can get away from two factors: 1) the necessary correlation between what is broadcast and received, which is the basic measure of <i>successful</i> communication -- if the impression your design creates is not the impression you intended or hoped for, is it really communication? or is it a purely unilateral action on the part of the viewer? --, and 2) the range of impressions it is possible to suggest are incredibly crude and small in number compared to the range of complex ideas that can be communicated through language. This is why the language of advertising people tends to rely on broad and vague notions -- we want this to look elegant; we want something playful; it needs to be dynamic; etc. --: because the kind of impressions one can 'communicate' visually (inspire, really) are that crude. Thinking about Erik Spiekermann's dictum again, one can say even that design primarily creates one of two impressions: 'We suck' or 'We don't suck'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Psychologist Karl Buehler said that there are three levels of language. First expressive-Ouch!; second communicative - run!, third descriptive - take your third left and you will see the train station. <br>The idea is that the later levels presume the earlier. Popper added argumentative - no, it's the fourth right, not the third, because they've moved the station entrance. Language can operate on the descriptive and argumentative levels in a much richer way than others. <br> <br>But, John, when it comes to expressive and communicative levels, the visual and aural and smell and taste can do heavy lifting. Just think of how much of a movie's success is dependent on the actor's expression and tone of voice and body language. Yes, you often can't follow the plot of a movie without subtitles of a film in a language you don't understand. But dubbing destroys so much of the impact of a film compared to the tone of voice, even when you don't understand the words. As to vision, just substitute Miss Piggy for Marilyn Monroe, and you are going to get a different film, even with the same words. <br> <br>With graphic design, the non-verbal elements are very important. Part is communicating heirarchy through visual relationships, as well as other conceptual relationships through visual relationships. And of course making sure words are easily readable - not easy in small sizes. And part is emotional tone and mood through color, use of space, illustration, photography. <br> <br>It seems to me that a great graphic designer adds that emotional punch as well as clarity. To carry the metaphor further, you need a screenplay, but the screenplay isn't the movie. The great graphic designer is like a great director, and can turn the words into something more powerful than words alone. <br> <br>I am a writer and love language, words, books - and even letters! But I know there is more to life, and graphic design is part of that more.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>But the tea pot is visually communicating...</i> <br> <br>This simple observation goes some way to reconciling some of the ideas in this thread. <br> <br>As Joe points out <i>it is the tea pot itself that is communicating</i>. One can say the same thing about anything else that we look at, including the products of graphic design: they can be said to communicate, and even if there is something metaphorical about this use of the term, it is close enough to a phenomenal description to be acceptable. Okay, so a thing can be said to communicate -- and since I gave the example of the Japanese tea pot, I have to admit that what it communicates goes beyond a vague impression: it is a sophisticated carrier of aesthetical values of a particular culture. And, of course, this was also my point about type design. <br> <br>Even so, there remains an important difference between saying that a thing communicates something to the viewer and saying that the maker of that thing communicates with the viewer. In the latter construction, you meet all my previous criticisms of the unreliability of non-verbal communication, because it remains very uncertain that what the thing communicates to the viewer is going to share significant identity with what the maker wants to communicate. [To get theological for a moment, one could even make this observation on a grand scale: noting that what creation communicates to most human beings is not necessarily what God intended to communicate; hence the need for verbal revelation.] <br> <br>So, Tiffany, I don't think <i>you</i> are a visual communicator, but what you design is. The relationship between what you might want to communicate and what a specific design actually communicates to a particular viewer may range from close identity to complete dissonance, over which you will only ever have very partial control.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Guillaume, I entirely agree, and I think my exchange with Héctor and Joe about the tea pot is precisely about this idea of signification, of things as carriers of meaning. My point is only that this does not necessarily constitute <i>communication,</i> which is the transfer if meaning, between the maker of a thing and the beholder of a thing. Which is why I question the idea of designers as visual communicators: the term implies a certainty that is largely absent from the practice. But note that while I do not think visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication, I do not think signification -- the investment of meaning in a thing -- is in any sense less phenomenal than communication. Indeed, I wouldn't be much of a Catholic if I believed that. Signification may, in fact, be much more powerful and effective than mere communication, or it may be as banal as the emptiest verbal expression: to a very large degree it depends what is being communicated or signified, <i>Pace,</i> McLuhan, the message is also the message.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>John, I usually find myself agreeing with you in this forum, but on this issue you are just flat wrong, and significantly wrong for this issue at hand. <br> <br>In the first place, 'communication' does not imply the certainty that you claim. According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary one meaning of this word is 'd. impart (feelings etc.) non-verbally (communicated his affection)'. So non-verbal communication is one normal understanding of this term, including its ambiguity. <br> <br>What the philosophical term 'signification' means is in fact probably a lot fuzzier than the normal English 'communication', which is ambiguous enough. <br> <br>I think you are confusing communication with description. I mentioned Karl Buehler's distinction above, and I think it is valid. Verbal description is a way to communicate, but there are many other ways. For example animals communicate a lot, but do not describe, with the possible exception of the dance of bees and apes who have been taught sign language. If Buehler is wrong, tell me why. <br> <br>Typefaces are abstract shapes with no direct descriptive reference, and so they are quite ambiguous. One can be more decorative, one more spare, and so on, and then there are historical associations and memories of where the same kind of face is used. Hence typefaces by themselves can communicate, but are quite limited in what they can communicate by their design. <br> <br>However, typefaces are only one ingredient or one tool of the designer's trade, and the good ones are going to use every visual means to communicate effectively. <br> <br>What is most important to understand, is that non-verbal communication is often emotionally more powerful and persuasive. It is not for nothing that most designers are paid in one way or another for advertising. But this goes for any communication. <br> <br>And the messages are much more specific than 'this is good' or 'this is bad'. Let me take two examples from what I am work I am doing now. First, by the design of my book 'Sayings of the Sages' (I am author and designer, but not publisher), I am trying to communicate: "These sayings are a precious legacy, which you would want to know, but they and the discussion of them are warm and accessible and not threatening." <br> <br>To get the 'precious' and 'classic' feel I am using a classic design, with red and black on ivory paper, using Jenson. To keep it welcoming the book is not too fat, and each set of sayings with all of its explanation and discussion guide is on one set of facing pages. There is also a fair amount of white space. I hope the cover will have some of the clean black and red Jenson, with a gold filagree frame, and everything will have classic repose and beauty. <br> <br>All this is a quite specific impression I want to create, and whether I succeed or not, this is exactly one important kind of thing that good graphic design can do. Actually I could go through every design decision, and tell you how it is designed to give a specific message, or to increase easy of access and understanding. Of course, beauty is one goal, but that is because it serves my purpose. <br> <br>A related kind of challenge is in a chart I am now working on of the Sages, including a time line. Here I am trying to include a great deal of information in a way that the reader can easily grasp. This is the kind of problem that Edward Tufte discusses in his books. Here the designer is using 'visual logic' to match the concepts that are you are attempting to communicate. And the design decisions are also not value neutral. For example, events of the outside world and the dates of the sages are prominent in my design. For Orthodox Jews this is subversive of the idea that all the sayings are in fact 'mi-sinai', from Sinai, from God, and timeless. And I mean it to be subversive; it's a conscious decision designed to be persuasive of a point of view. <br> <br>Now graphic designers also regularly use illustration and photography with text also, which again can communicate even more specifically, and often with great emotional power. <br> <br>I don't like the term 'visual communicator', which has no poetry, or is the opposite of poetry. But Tiffany is right on target concerning the task of graphic designers. It communicates to me, clearly and verbally! <br> <br>>I do not think visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication <br> <br>Powerful and reliable are two different things. Right on 'reliable', wrong on 'powerful'. I will give you an example. <br> <br>A lady I knew liked my work and had me out to talk to her community about applying traditional ethics to modern life - in fact she had done a Master's thesis on this topic, I learned. <br> <br>She was very friendly, then I didn't hear from her for some time afterwards. Well, I blew that, I figured. Then I spotted her at a conference, buying a book. She saw me out of the corner of her eye, but seemed reluctant to acknowledge me. Ah, well. Then she turned suddenly, blew me a kiss, and rushed off. There was no mistaking the sincere affection, but what was that all about? Two months later I read of her death from cancer. This was her kiss goodbye. I cherish her memory. Would an e-mail; 'sorry I haven't been well, best wishes' have done the same as that blown kiss that haunts my memory? Did it communicate? With ambiguity, but what power.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I questioned whether it was reliable enough for someone to describe herself, professionally, as a 'visual communicator'. <br> <br>Well, we are now on the same page. Your point about the greater ambiguity of visual communication is generally sound, as I have acknowledged. However, no graphic designer claims that they are going to communicate for their client by visual means alone, without language. What is rather conveyed is that the designer will help make the visual *dimension* of the communication complement the words, so that the overall communication is more effective and persuasive than words alone would be. <br> <br>Designers never claim to substitute for the writer, so your argument is misplaced. You don't acknowledge that using the visual dimension to communicate text more effectively is in fact the task of a graphic designer - which I take to be Tiffany's point. <br> <br>In a very text-heavy setting, a lot of that effort will not be emotional, but pragmatic: making the text easy and comfortable to read. But even in text-heavy environments, the emotional dimension is very important, because you want to increase the chances that you are going to be read, and have the emotional tone of the visual match the tone of the text. <br> <br>Also even in text-heavy environments the visual design can be critical to understanding. Maps and equations are examples. The graphics of these communicate much more effectively than verbal explanation of the same thing. And effective visual presentation of information just from the point of view of quick comprehension is a field in itself, as Tufte's books illustrate. <br> <br>When there are fewer words and more graphic elements, then the visual will play a stronger role, but still in service of the client's message in words, with their persuasive purpose. For example, I think of the great theatrical posters that Christos Tsolerides has put up on Typophile for critique. These could have just had the name and location in large Arial letters black on white, no illustrations, and verbally communicated just as well. But they certainly would not have been as inviting to the potential audience. <br> <br>Now as to the power of the blown kiss. I took this example to acknowledge your point about the ambiguity of visual communication alone, but to make clear the additional power that the visual element can add power that is not in words alone. First of all the blown kiss, with the expression on the face, did communicate affection and good will powerfully; you are just flat wrong that it failed to communicate. The full sad meaning, it is true, only became clear when I learned more. But my point is that I could have the same information from e-mail messages, as I said. The blown kiss was way more powerful than words alone.</div>

<div class=commentbody>William, I think the power and 'full sad meaning' of your experience is really an example of the importance of the interpretational context. This is what changed between the blowing of the kiss and your eventual understanding of it. <br> <br>But I don't want to analyse to death what is obviously a profound personal memory for you, so I'll clarify what I meant when I wrote that I don't consider 'visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication'. I'm clearly not referring to emotional power: I'm talking about the power of language that comes from its flexibility, sophistication, its productive ability to create context, i.e. power as effective ability, not direct force. I'm not saying that the raw impact of visual media is less powerful than that of language; obviously this is not so, and this is why people rely on visual means to attract attention, inspire a emotional response, and communicate impressions within a framework of cultural associations (such as your example of a 'precious' and 'classic' feel). Visuals do all these things well. But what I've been talking about is the power of language to communicate, especially to communicate ideas, especially complex ideas; again, this is power in the sense of effective ability, of 'having the power to do more'. I come back to the example I raised earlier: this discussion could not be had visually. In terms of <i>communication,</i> language is more powerful because it has more effective ability to convey ideas from one mind to another.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Darrel, start reading at the beginning. The idea of a 'visual language' is a metaphor (a point on which my friend who is both a painter and a philosophy professor is adamant). Human language is a unique activity that is only vaguely and inaccurately paralleled in other forms of communication. The difference between the conventional and culturally-bound 'systems' of meaning in art and design and the centrality of natural language to human thought and to self-consciousness is huge. Indeed, the former is only understandable by virtue of the latter. As soon as you start to consciously think about something that you are looking at, it ceases to be visual and starts to become thoughts in your mind that are formed through language.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, to recapitulate: your initial claim was that "much of what graphic designers do is not communicative at all; it is at most evocative ..." Thus your view that what graphic design can do is only "to make our environment more pleasant and interesting to inhabit" and that claiming to do "visual communication" is "bogus". <br> <br>I think my disagreement with you here is that I think you are setting up a false dichotomy between precise description in language, and vague positive or negative emotional evocation. The falsity of that dichotomy is significant because the work of graphic design actually does fit in the real middle ground between these poles. <br> <br>Take a very simple example: the skull and cross bones on a poison label. Just the word </div>

<div class=commentbody>William, going back to my 'initial claim' now is a bit unfair, since I hope it is obvious that I have modified and developed my ideas since then. I still think that using the term 'visual communicator' as a kind of professional label for graphic designers is very questionable, because to me the term 'communication' implies more than graphic designers can reliably deliver. I don't think I need to disagree with any of your well stated points about the role of design in assisting communication, in 'conveying messages' to 'move the other person to act in some way' (usually involving a credit card), in order to maintain this position. <br> <br>What I've been trying to challenge in this discussion are presumptions, not only about visual communication, but also about the acceptance of communication as a one-way transmission of a 'message', which is a staple of our various media and of the design that services them. Yes, the job of most graphic designers is 'to communicate the client</div>

<div class=commentbody>>going back to my 'initial claim' now is a bit unfair <br> <br>It wasn't clear to me you had moved off this view, which is what got me writing at length. <br>I certainly agree with you that there is too little genuine dialogue about ideas. I do enjoy your thought-provoking ideas, and the following discussions. <br> <br>>sell us a message rather than an idea to which we might respond critically. <br> <br>I think the problem is not presence of selling - for like it or not we all have something to sell. The problem is the great rarity of genuine critical discussion in search of the truth. I am totally of a mind with you on that. I have to think that the decline of reading, in particular book reading, is a contributing factor. But there is also the problem that it is a rare individual who can have dialogue including disagreement and make it a search for the truth rather than a quarrel. Our culture does not train or educate people for such dialogue. Who was it who said 'the passion for the truth is the faintest of human emotions'. Not true, but there is so much interfering with the desire for understanding that it is usually buried by competing interests and motives. <br> <br>I have a friend who is writing a book on 'Conversation' - in which English history plays a central role - which touches on these issues.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Very fine posting my friends. <br> <br>Is it true that reading is declining in our time? Which is our comparison point? I have the opposite perception, I think that people tends to read more everyday, people now tend to get more education and to prepare more themselves. The publishing industry has never been a biggest bussines.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hector, I was thinking of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33956-2005Jan24.html?sub=AR" target=_blank>this article</a> when I wrote that. It is mainly about gender differences, but documents the latest declines in book reading in the US. Is a similar thing happening elsewhere? <br> <br>It may be that more text is being read because of the internet. But a lot of that, with some exceptions like Typophile, is not very intellectually demanding.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"We/one cannot not communicate", is by Paul Watzlawick. Even if Erik Spiekermann made use of this phrase. <br> <br>In fact, one of the most stimulating books on communication, though the title doesn't suggest it, is "Die Krise der Psychologie" by Karl Buehler. (By the way, I prefer to think of Buehler's three "levels" as "aspects".) <br> <br>What John Hudson calls communication -- to "communicate an idea" -- sounds like "transmit an idea". I have some reservations against using the word "communication" that way. <br>To speak of "communication" requires not only somebody uttering something by words or gesture or leaving physical marks here and there, i.e. "design", but also somebody interpreting these utterances *some or another way*. Some one saying something and another one not even paying attention may be communication too -- to the understanding of a third who considers what he sees as being meaningful. <br>What are "ideas"? You never "have" them but must conceive of, or guess at, them. The only thing one actually "has" are the marks, the material side of signs: sounds, gestures, ink on paper, which are to be interpreted. But these marks are just as unstable as are "ideas" themselves, especially when it comes to "visual/visible language". Unfortunately, communication by visual means is not a subject taught at schools, and so there are no lessons in ethics of use. What some one considers a mark, someone else doesn't necessarily too; and not in all circumstances all aspects of the mark are of importance. (This latter aspect can be found in Buehler's writings too, he calls it "abstraktive Relevanz".) <br> <br>Whether a designer regards "design" as problem-solving or otherwise is his personal choice, based on his background and motivation for becoming a designer. To me, design as problem-solving is not the worst description -- I assume that most design jobs are in fact tidying up visually things that others are incapable to lay out properly. Just like philosophy is, or can be, tidying up thought ... <br> <br>> Should a graphic designer be called a graphic designer? <br> <br>Good idea!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Karsten, I'm not happy with the phrase 'transmit an idea', because this suggests exactly the kind of one-way message broadcast that I have criticised at length in this thread, and which is the norm of most of our media, and the form and matter of virtually all graphic design. <br> <br>To me, the ideal of communication is conversation, particularly the free exchange and <i>co-development</i> of ideas among knowledgable people who express themselves well in their common language. This is why I consider visual communication inherently stunted: even the most generous parallel -- e.g. metaphors of 'visual language' -- cannot recognise anything like the common language that makes conversation possible, either in kind or in scope. <br> <br>I agree with Joe that your post was very well said, and this is precisely my point: the complexity of the thoughts that you communicate, the complexity of my reading of them, the complexity of incorporating them into the overall conversation of this thread so far: all these things are only possible because of the sophistication of language. Like virtually everything else in this thread, the thoughts conveyed by your 'well said' post are not something that could be communicated visually. Complex ideas are the domain of language.</div>
