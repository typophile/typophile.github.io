    you're looking for (people love to love and love to hate Helvetica), this topic
    has been exhausted on Typophile. If I was your professor, I'd recommend you look
    for a different topic. Something fresh. Or fresh-ER. \r\n\r\n"

    subject that rehashes a popular trend is not a great way to make your portfolio
    stand out. You\u2019re going to be graduating in a very tough job market. Having
    a standout thesis to show off will be important!"

    for such a much-covered one, you'll have to (1) know what has been said and written
    about this before \u2013 so read existing stuff, then (2) find your own niche/perspective/question/angle
    of research which is novel/special, and (3) do a lot of brainwork yourself. Then
    maybe you'll arrive at new insights. Otherwise, chances are it's really just going
    to make you look\u2026 unimaginative."

    Helvetica's (or, Helvetica & Arial's) accessibility in electronic media one of
    the reasons for it's continued dominance in the world? Although, that Verdana

    Matthew Carter even worked on some Helvetica fonts. But since Verdana was originally
    designed specifically for small sizes on screen it seems to be a better choice
    for electronic media.\r\n\r\nIt makes me wonder if there would have been an \"ikeagate\"
    if they had made the decision to use Verdana for screen and Helvetica for print/display/signs."

    just like other famous fonts like futura, frutiger, universe and many other its
    a designer''s personal choice and accessibility is also another aspect that you
    could look into. Plus the time Helvetica was created it was the best replacement
    for futura and later frutiger came in the scene. '

  body: "Here is something that for all the love  / hate Helvetica / Arial discussion
    I cannot work out.\r\n\r\nHelvetica - designed way before the birth of digital
    media so could be said is a print typeface looks like dirt in Word.\r\n\r\nArial
    early 80's designed for IBM as a built in printer bitmap font looks perfect in
    word.\r\n\r\nBoth are really font that came well before the digital revolution
    - \r\n\r\nSo my question is this - why does Helvetica look so $H17 in MS word.\r\n\r\nsee
    attached - i might be missing something really obvious but I dont use Helv in
    a largely typed doc because I cant stand to look at it in word.\r\n\r\nI spend
    longer looking at fonts on screen than the final printed article so this is where
    it matters to me and probably most of you if you think about it.\r\n\r\nJH\r\n\r\nwww.the-cave.co.uk[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HELL-vetica_5097.jpg]"

  body: Helvetica looks fine on my Mac; in my experience it only looks terrible in
    Windows XP. I'm going to guess that Windows' bitmapping algorithm isn't as friendly
    as Mac OS's, or that the particular version of Helvetica you find most often on
    Windows boxes (don't know what it is or what it's bundled with) has really terrible
    hinting?
