  council discusses about socio-economic questions and submits it's suggestions to
  the county.\r\nAt the moment, they use the county's id, but they would like to have
  their own identity. \r\nThey want something that reflects what theay are, and that
  is also fresh, new and modern !\r\nObviously, fresh, new and modern is miles away
  from what they are. \r\n\r\nI don't feel like giving them a pictogram, so I was
  thinking about fresh colour and a logo of letters, but I already can hear them say
  \"we could have done this by ourselves\" (Yes that's the kind of guys I've got to
  struggle with...)\r\n\r\nWell, I'm now after letters that would <em>look like a
  logo</em>. \r\n\r\nI thought at first of [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/psyops/reykjavik_two_d_gauge_oblique_ot/
  | reykjavik ]] but the uppercase E was of a bit too much, I decided then on FF Sanuk
  Bold italic, \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanuk_3994.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  feel this might be not enough, any help or advice would be really appreciated\r\n"

    a Logo of Letters\"]]\r\n\r\nI was struggling with a group of initials. This free
    article, with dozens of letter-linking concepts I hadn't thought of, made me decide
    to subscribe to the magazine awhile back.\r\n\r\nYour particular group of letters
    might be easier to work into a design with lower case. All four letters would
    then contain curves. \r\n\r\nI think jupiterboy's is being facetious with the
    cane idea..."

    possible, with a bit of gentle education, C/W diagrams with circles and arrows,
    of what has been done elsewhere and what's behind other successful designs to
    explain to them how visual communication works. If it were explained on the same
    simple level the stock market would need to explained to me, it should be possible
    to convince your clients of the merits of your concepts. Most people have absolutely
    no reason to have any understanding of what a designer does or what makes you
    an expert at it. What they think they want is something that's flashy and cool
    when what they really want is something that talks to people on levels they don't
    know exist. And why should they? Other people's areas of expertise can be black
    boxes too. Perhaps you just need to give them a peek inside yours. They might
    get it. :o)\r\n\r\nOr, as was explained to me years ago, \"Clients don't know
    what they want. It's your job to tell them.\"\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    as the letters are initials, I just can't do that. This article from B&A is really
    interesting, thanks.\r\n\r\n<em>it should be possible to convince your clients
