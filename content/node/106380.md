  body: "Looks like lithography from the second half of the 19th century.\r\nNote
    the letters are on an arc. Extremely difficult to do this with type in letterpress
    printing. The second S is very close to to the first S but there seem to be differences
    that are not due to effects of photographing at an angle.\r\nThis is a Tuscan
    letterform with spurs.\r\nThe style was very common but with many variations.\r\nThere
    is probably a typeface from the era that looks similar to these letters. \r\nA
    digital font with some resemblance to the core of these letters is Bruce foundry's
    Style No.1050 digitized by Jim Spiece as Frisco Antique\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/\r\nDon"

  body: "Ryan, I forgot to ask you for the source of the lettering and if you have
    any more letters.\r\nI was thinking it might be a stock certificate or sheet music?
    Company or title?\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"
