  reunion tour has coaxed a mere $66.1m (?46m) from audiences across the pond. That's
  small change for a tentpole release these days \u2013 especially one that reportedly
  cost $200m \u2013 and Robin Hood will do well to creep past $100m before the theatrical
  cycle comes to a close. But studio heads know that even when a movie disappoints
  in the domestic market, they can, if the circumstances are right, rely on the international
  arena to prop it up.\r\n\r\nThat usually means having a universal, well-executed
  story with recognisable cast. Comedies, for example, are notoriously poor travellers
  because of cultural differences. The way the studios see it, everybody responds
  to a gun and a girl, but not everybody will get a gag. So something like MacGruber
  (see chart below), the US comedy that opened poorly over the weekend and is based
  on a sketch known only to Saturday Night Live aficionados, would appear to be dead
  in the water.\r\n\r\nBut if you've got an action movie directed by Ridley Scott
  that boasts a firmament of international stars like Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett,
  veteran William Hurt and the darkly charismatic Mark Strong, you'll fancy your chances
  overseas. Universal's international distribution machine has drummed up $125m for
  Robin Hood so far, and that's in line with the received wisdom that a major studio
  release tends to gross two-thirds of its worldwide total outside North America.\r\n\r\nBut
  even a slickly produced movie with a name cast needs a leg-up, and any marketing
  maven will tell you that in the pantheon of leg-ups they don't rank any higher than
  the Cannes international film festival. Previous Hollywood releases like The Da
  Vinci Code and Shrek 2 have benefited from a promotional push on the Cote d'Azur,
  and Robin Hood is no different.\r\n\r\nThe studio saved money on a global publicity
  tour because it got the world's press in one place and created a nice buzz in the
  opening weekend. The follow-up weekend was solid, and the movie's international
  gross will end up sparing Universal's blushes. After a relatively soft opening weekend
  in North America for Shrek Forever After, the DreamWorks Animation-Paramount people
  might be wishing they'd secured an opening night berth on the Croisette, too. Then
  again, that movie's initial international foray over the weekend delivered excellent
  results.\r\n\r\nKites is a Bollywood movie that sneaked into the top 10 this weekend.
  It was released through Reliance Big Pictures, a division of the influential Indian
  telecoms, finance and entertainment conglomerate Reliance ADA Group that partially
  bankrolled Steven Spielberg's new-look DreamWorks and has been running around Hollywood
  signing production deals with a host of talent from Brad Pitt to Julia Roberts to
  Brett Ratner.\r\n"
