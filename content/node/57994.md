  I've found this font online that I've used in a InDesign document, and when exporting
  this to PDF my norwegian letters disappear! So what do I do? They for sure show
  up properly in the InDesign fil. Using a Mac!"

  body: "What kind of settings are you using to export to pdf? Something like PDF/X-1a:2001
    should do it right. \r\nAnd if all else fails, you can always convert the text
    to outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry to use English, my Swedish skills are pretty poor,
    not to mention Norwegian ;^)"

    tegn, kodefeil, komplett frav\xE6rende kerning og elendig spacing. Anyway, bra
    det ordnet seg."
