body: "Hi\r\n\r\nA customer is trying to embed a set of eight TT fonts all of which
  have installable embedding set. All the fonts have the same glyph set and index
  order, the default glyphs are all correct and MS FontValidator does not return any
  errors, yet from within MS Publisher four show as 'will embed' and four show as
  'may not embed'. The customer has been reporting inconsistent results across different
  machines when trying to embed.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what might be upsetting Publisher?

  body: I've used the 'pack and go' wizard for commercial printing before without
    a problem. If the fonts all have proper embedding permissions, as you say, then
    I'm not sure what the issue could be. What version of Publisher?

  body: Found it. I hade PS style font name in the Name Table - Windows Full Name.
    A left over from making the font in CFF. Changing that back has got it to work
    as it should.

  body: "Adam\r\n\r\nWhen I made the first version of the fonts, I made them as CFF
    OpenType fonts which meant that I set the Platform 3 FullName (field 4) to the
    PostScript Name, which in the case of these fonts included a hyphen between the
    Family name and the Style name. The client preferred to have TTF OpenType fonts
    which ment that the Platform 3 FullName should have been without the hyphen.\r\n\r\nMy
    way of working is always to work with the OpenType names records directly.\r\n\r\nI
    think that MSPublisher is the only application that baulks at this but I may be
    wrong.\r\n\r\nM"

    fonts in TTF format where the FullName 4.3.1.1033 has a hyphen? Which version
    of Publisher, which OS? \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "No Adam, I'm not saying that MSPublisher has a problem \"seeing\" them.\r\n\r\nMSPublisher
    seems to have a problem recognising TTF fonts as embedable when they carry a hyphen
    in the Windows Full Name (4.3.1.1033), even when the correct embedding bits have
    been set. The \"embedability\" of fonts is displayed in the 'Tools>Commercial
    Printing Tools>Fonts' dialog of MSPublisher.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to do
    extensive research into this problem suffice to say that changing the 4.3.1.1033
    field in these TTF's by changing the hyphen to a space caused the 'Tools>Commercial
    Printing Tools>Fonts' dialog to show them as 'embedable' where before they were
    shown as 'may not embed'.\r\n\r\nM"
