    Grotesk Bold Extended</a> is about the closest I have come to it, but the C and
    S are still not quite as closed as your sample. I can't see the G well enough
    to use it to help with the ID.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I can say that I don't think it's anything they sell -- so it comes from an independent
    foundry.\r\n\r\nThe closest resemblances were <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/formula/\">TS
    Formula</a> from TypeShop (which is probably a version of some other design --
    most of theirs seem to be); <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/fuller-sans-dt/\">Fuller
    Sans</a> from DTP Types; <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/styles\">Benton
    Sans</a> from Font Bureau; <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/paralucent/\">Paralucent</a>
    from Device; and I kept looking at Franklin Gothics of various foundries.\r\n\r\nI
    will keep track of this thread to see what comes out, but I have made my attempt
    for now. Good luck.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
