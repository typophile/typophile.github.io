body: "Not trying to forge the ticket -- don't worry!  I'm trying to write software
  that allows you to take a picture of your ticket and then recognizes the numbers
  so you don't have to check a bunch of them.  Knowing the specific font the ticket
  is printed in makes digit identification in the pictures far more accurate.\r\n\r\nI've
  used \"What the font\" and \"identifont\" and nothing's an exact match.  Here are
  a list of fonts that this resembles:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans-mono/\">Nimbus
  Sans Mono:</a>:\r\nThe mid-line height of the \"4\" is lower on Nimbus sans, and
  the left side of the 5 is slanted instead of straight.  The leg of the \"R\" is
  curved instead of straight.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/mono-condensed/\">Mono
  Condensed</a>:\r\nSame as Nimbus -- mid-line of 4 is too low, 5 is slanted, R is
  curved\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/gothic-720/\">Gothic
  720</a>:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/folio-sb/\">Folio
  SB</a>:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/condensed/\">Grotesque
  MT Condensed</a>:\r\nMidpoint of \"M\" is at the baseline instead of in the middle.
  \ The capital \"I\" is just a line without top/base.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/powerball_6040.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign_6398.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/terminal_4377.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ticket_4008.jpg]"

  body: "I apologize in advance for this long, off-topic post - it has nothing to
    do with font-identification, it's mostly about OCR and image recognition.\r\n\r\nI
    have wrote a similar application last year for banking/financial sector to recognize
    digits (customer id, amount to pay etc.) from a photo of a printed bill taken
    by iPhone. I used the tesseract open-source OCR engine.\r\n\r\nI understand that
    you need the original font to train your  OCR module but I think it's not actually
    required and more than this it may lead to inaccurate results, due to the difference
    between the perfect digit image rendered by the original font and the poor image
    quality acquired by taking a photo of an actual ticket.\r\n\r\nHere is my advice
    on how to improve your results:\r\n\r\n1. Create some good set of filters to equalize
    the image and remove any artifacts that could be considered noise and might confuse
    the OCR engine. Possible \"noise\" includes also any solid blobs of pixels bellow
    a Xmin x Ymin size or larger than Xmax or Ymax size - which are actually useless
    to the OCR engine.\r\n\r\n2. If you are using a mobile device, create an anti-shake
    mechanism (use the accelerometer to take the photo only when the device is stable).
    No OCR can have good results on blurry images.\r\n\r\n3. If you are using a mobile
    device, consider to *not* use the flash in some cases - e.g. when there are some
    numbers to recognize far away from flash/lens axis. The natural light will be
    much more effective in this case. (The camera-to-ticket distance is  usually small
    and the device flash can light only a part of the ticket resulting in a gradient
    than is difficult to equalize and/or filter it out).\r\n\r\n4. Collect as much
    *real* tickets as you can to create 4-5 digital samples of each required digit
    / size combination and train your OCR with these samples. OCR Engines usually
    includes algorithms to recognize broken samples (e.g. a '9' can be recognized
    as a broken/misprinted '8') and the only way to tell the engine when/how to use
    these algorithms is to train it using real samples.\r\n\r\n5. Last but not least:
    Use regular expressions to extract/validate the OCR result - this can have a tremendous
    impact in your recognition results.\r\nExample: Let's say that your ticket's printed
    text is: \"BO 123.23 BI\" and you know that you need to read the amount 123.23.
    The OCR output could be as wrong as:\r\n\"80 123.2381\", but if you extract a
    pattern of ([0-9]+)([.]{1})([0-9]{2}) of it, you will still be able to get a correct
    result out of an erroneous OCR reading.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your application
