  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone,

Currently I'm helping a friend out. She's an Interior Architect who recently started up up her own business. Her clients are (richer) private home owners and companies (mostly headoffices). The logo should both reflect being a small studio, as well as have a professional enough look for the bigger companies. 

I'm almost set on the logo, which represents a house, with a pencil inside (interior) and is a capital A > the first letter of the studio name. 

But now having troubles with the lockup. The type is Univers, and not kerned yet.

I would like to hear your reactions on the logo, and suggestions on the typography,

Thanks,

Marco

Do you think it would be better to search another font (like rounded)? I have tried the mark with straight corners, but it somehow looses its flow, IMO. But I could use some fresh eyes...

I see what you're trying to do here.  I didn't pick up the figure-ground-reversal at first.  I didn't even get it on the second or third time.  I believe you're trying to have that duality of image but frankly, it's not working because the balance isn't there.

Some observations:
The rounded corners throw me off; makes me think "children" or "immature."  There's no sophistication here.  Is there a reason you haven't ALL CAPS?  You have a lot of vertical movement with the House and Pencil illustration, which can be cool, but you need to follow it with the typography.

Questions to ask yourself:
If she's fun/funky, why not tilt the house?  Capitalize on the fun/funky 'cause that's what's going to set her brand apart from anyone else.

Architecture is about the 3D form, yes?  Why leave this as a 2D logo?  What would happen if you add depth to the illustration but kept the concept of the pencil within the house?

best regards,
daniel</div>

		<div class="commentbody">imo, trying to mix 3 different symbols might be quite difficult and trying too hard will get you a bad logo. I'ld stick on 2 symbols, like the A and the House, or the pen and the house, etc. If you ever succeed to get those 2 together well, maybe the third will fit if you're lucky enough.
(excuse bad english)
good luck,

I would most certainly drop 5a, 5b, 7a, 7b, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h. There was a Little Johnny joke about this shape being someone fetching a soap from the floor.


Hmm .. actually 8a/8b are very nice. A bit too simplistic, but the A in a neg space is awesome.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that number 2 is interesting because the angle makes it more dynamic and multi-dimensional. However the shape within throws it off because it's not at the same angle  as the outer shape. In most of your shape-within-a-shape designs you seem to be avoiding lining up the shape within to the shape outside – is this on purpose? Some of them are off by just a little bit and perhaps would create more harmony if they were balanced. Be aware of the small details of the others... some of them are small on-screen and could potentially fill in when printing.</div>

My own picks were 2/3/6a/8a. I will coninue on those. There is something else i want to try too, because of number 2. I really like the 2D vs 3D effect in this. Probably post new developements tomorrow.

@epsilicon/penn > I really like 8a but in my sketches (on paper) I just couldn't make it more 'not simple', specific... Any ideas on this (or is that my job:))...? I tried with serifs, maybe i'll go that way.

@natalie_F > please note that these are quick drafts, to visually order my ideas.But thanks for the heads up on the detailing, definitely a thing to always remember:). And for the offbalance > I didn't do it on purpose, but some felt to rigid hen centering everything. 

Anyone else care to chime in?

For no real logical reason, I want the white space between the lead and the pencil wood to match the weight of the typeface. 

Or, I want to add an s-shaped walking path up to the little pencil house .. and change the name to "Appelo Studio" to create the initials AS to match the mark. Ok, well, maybe not.

But my white space idea might unify the mark and type better...?

There needs to be a bigger contrast in size to hold up that mark.

Im thinking more the  leaning towards the futura option, only with the type slightly smaller... Next up is color. I know it has to be yellow. I really like black and yellow for this type of form/identity.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding6_6100.png]

Also, I have another idea I want to present to the client (on monday we will have our first meeting and I will show her above option and below). I am wondering on your opinions on this direction also. Thanks alot so far... Fire away:)

Red works better than the black, but I think charcoal gray or a dark, grassy green might be more architect-ish. The shadows are lost on black, and this ruins the 3D effect.

I also think it needs significant tweaking, starting with making the north/south seam straight. The room is tilting left. I'd also position the a so the seam between the floor and the left wall doesn't appear to swallow a (missing) serif. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everybody, 

I'm very grateful for all your help! Here are the 'final concepts' I'm going to show the client later today. Final concepts, meaning that after she chooses one over the other, I can tweak the design with more focus. I've eliminated color, which will come later on, to let her choose solely on concept. 

@Ed/Alaskan/Picard: Thanks for the vote of confidence, I too like the 3d concept better, but it's just a little 'unconventional'. I will be tweaking the form, and try more variations. Alaskan, good call on the axis-thing. I've attached a variation on the perspective which I think would be stronger, and communicate the idea better.

@Courtney: I really appreciate your input. I'm not letting go the pencil yet... :)

Fire away! (sorry for the bigger images)

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, so it's kind of sad that it took this long to bring up this topic...but...what does everyone think about correlation? Is there too much detachment between the symbol and name? I like the very first one out of the bunch just because it is neither a pencil nor a house, it's both! and that's visual wit. On the other side, I fine myself asking "Would anyone else get that?" And the name doesn't help. Then I find myself asking "What is the company even about?" and that's bad. Any ideas?

PS Great job btw, the hard work is paying off, it's getting much better :)

		<div class="commentbody">I definitely second Sharon Van Lieu. Wrapping the 'a' around the exterior offers you some new possibilities to let the mark comunicate expansion instead of contraction.

Regarding to concept 1 the mark looks best to me in those two versions although I'm not sure about the combination of mark and text and about the typographiy in special case. The icon is very generic in this versions and displays an 'A', a pencil and a house all at once. There is not too much special about it (which I really like) and so maybe the typography needs to be emphasized a bit more because I think that many people who don't know the story aren't instantly able to translate the meaning of the icon properly and just see it as some kind of geometrical shapes and then it would be nice to have a more 'special' typography.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/studio_appelo_6115.jpg]</div>
