  Corporation&#39;s intranet site about fonts and the legal issues that pertain to
  them. This would have to be short, sweet and to the point, but something more than
  just: <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t steal fonts! <BR> <BR>Feed the designers! <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
  steal fonts! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear your suggestions. If you could tell a
  massive corporation what they should know about fonts, what would you write? Better
  yet, can you do it in Power Point bullet point style so popular in the corporate
  world? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>kristin'

    <a href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/The_Case_for_a_User-Friendly_EULA" target="_blank">The
    Case for a User-Friendly EULA</a>. <BR> <BR>I think a huge mistake is to think
    if it is downloadable from the internet it must be free. Another lesson to be
    learned would be that sharing promotes licensing, because it doesn&#39;t.

  body: Hi Kristin. I wish all corps had someone as considerate as you on <BR>their
    design team. Every time I see an ad from your company I <BR>smile and think &#34;that
    font was properly licensed -  the designer <BR>got paid for his work.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>AIGA has a nice little guide. Download <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/designbusinessandethics"

  body: Thanks for the compliment. We do like to feed type designers here. <BR> <BR>But,
    heck, Stephen! You&#39;re supposed to look at those ads and think, &#34;I need
    to go out and buy that stuff right now!!&#34; The marketing experts here wouldn&#39;t
    have a clue what to do with your reaction! <BR> <BR>Thanks for the links, Si,
    Tiffany and Stephen.  <BR> <BR>More input is welcome, as well.
