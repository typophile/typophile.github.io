  is a pencil illustration vectorized and modified in Illustrator and Photoshop .
  \r\nAs you can see for now it looks awful , so I wanted to know from the experts
  what do they think and what you would change to make it better. I am lost as it's
  my first illustration-composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/i/mood2.png/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPierluigi\r\n\r\n"

    and read them. The last time I was in Italy there was no shortage of good design
    books on the shelves.

  body: 'Pierluigi, a good starting point for any graphic design project is to decide
    exactly what message you''re trying to communicate.  So I''d suggest writing a
    sentence or two that explains to us exactly what you''re trying to express in
    your illustration. That will give us a better starting point for making suggestions. '

  body: actually I explained myself badly. It's more of an illustration-composition
    project to show potential employees that , apart from having knowledge of logo
    design websites etc, I can also create this type of compositions. This one has
    only the objective to be sort of eye pleasing , cool colors and forms..

  body: "> This one has only the objective to be sort of eye pleasing ...\r\n\r\nPierluigi,
    thanks for the additional info. But if you're going to make the word \"mood\"
    the focal point of the illustration, employers will assume it's an example of
    what you might draw if they asked you to make an illustration on that subject.
    \ \r\n\r\nI'd suggest making the entire composition say something about \"mood\".
    For example, if the mood was \"angry\", what font would you use, what color would
    the word be, and what would the background elements be? What if the mood was \"happy\"
    or \"sad\"? Or what if the word was \"Moods\" (plural), how could you illustration
    a variety of moods in a single composition?   \r\n\r\nWhatever word or meaning
    you pick, make sure the composition communicates a strong message or feeling.
    That will make a much stronger impression with employers. Design isn't about just
    drawing pretty pictures; it's all about communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ok, I get your point . I know that communication is the 1# objective in graphic
    design , but this project is only something to show to friends and just show them
    what you can do with photoshop , it only needed to be eye pleasing, nothing else.
    But anyway I see your point.. it has no sense this project, it conveys no message.

  body: "This is not a design project for any client , just a random picture I made
    up for myself . It's not graphic design. I didn't include any message ,for me
    it only needed to look cool,just a random composition of colors, like abstract
    art, is this a crime ? I know that communication is the FIRST thing in our job
    , without design is WORTHLESS,I always convey messages and feelings in my design
    project , but this is not one of them. I wanted to try and just mess around for
    once.NO employer will see this , it won't appear in my  portfolio, I won't show
    it to clients. Just me and some friends of mine , to show them what I can do with
    3d software + photoshop, right?Technical abstract stuff, I don't know the exact
    definition for this project .\r\nNever mind anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: "I don't see any harm in \"messing around.\" Having personal process unrelated
    to actual client-based work is extremely important. But when you post that work
    online and ask for feedback, but then claim \"I wanted to try and just mess around
    for once,\" well there's no real critique or feedback for that (from me anyways.)\r\n\r\nMy
    main issue was when you said \"just show them what you can do with photoshop.\"
    Anyone can do that in photoshop. Why not do \"real\" process with paint and pens,
    etc.? Just a thought."

  body: "My making up a purpose for the design, it makes the job a lot easier. That
    way can show how you're able to use your abilities and it will actually be a lot
    easier to come up with something. You don't have to put that much thought into
    the purpose. For example: you're making a cover for a drinks menu for a gay night
    club called Mood. Now you can imagine the types of colors used at such a club.
    What kind of atmosphere it has. What the client\xE8le would be into. Maybe it's
    a self titled post rock album by a band called Mood. Maybe a subway poster for
    Mood jeans.\r\n\r\nThose projects will also show what you can do with Photoshop
    with the bonus of having focus and showing that you can put your talents to use.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the design you showed:\r\nThe spraypaint splatter thing has been over for
    many years and you used dead gray (zero saturation). Never, ever use dead gray.\r\nEven
    though it feels like the design is attempting to be trendy, the palette doesn't
    seem to correspond to current color trends. If you were going for 1989 retro,
    the yellow doesn't seem right unless you pair it with purple and maybe teal. It
    feels like a bunch of colors someone made up in Photoshop, to be honest.\r\nThe
    way you're using that counterless font feels a bit like 2007.\r\nDiagonal lines
    as a decorative element isn't due for a comeback until the 2020s, especially when
    used with spray paint. Need for Speed Most Wanted used that kind of look in the
    menu interface in 2006 and it already felt a few years out of date."

  body: "> Never, ever use dead gray\r\n\r\nI call it \"cool gray\" (\"cool\" meaning
    the opposite of \"warm\"). And while it's not appropriate for all jobs, it's perfectly
    appropriate in some. One example off the top of my head is Apple, which uses cool
    grays all the time in their graphic design.  But I agree that it's not what I'd
    use in this particular illustration.\r\n\r\n"

    exists in a computer. Maybe other people don't notice it but to me it stands out.
    I always get colors from somewhere, a photo, painting, clothes etc.\r\n\r\nDead
    gray is appropriate for retro computer/videogame themes and pairs well with <a

  body: "Graphic designers often use the term \"cool gray\" because we frequently
    use the Pantone Matching System (PMS) to specify ink colors, and \"cool gray\"
    is the term that Pantone uses for grays with no saturation. The PMS system is
    also built into programs like PhotoShop and InDesign, along with RGB, CMYK, etc.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, \"PMS Cool Gray 5\" is a solid ink color that's equivalent to a 50% screen
    of black. \r\n\r\n"
