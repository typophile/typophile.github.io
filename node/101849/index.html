  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello. I&rsquo;m working on my first serious text face and currently the x-height is set to 410 units which happened automatically upon drawing the first character. I&rsquo;m a newbie and know very little about the technical aspects of typeface design. Apart from readability, what are the other aspects which will influence when deciding the x-height; how does a designer determine the appropriate x-height.  Thank you.</div>

Does it look good as it is now?
If yes.. leave it as is.
If no... change it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Sevag! You can tell a question is good when it&rsquo;s hard to answer&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;if it looks good, it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; always works. If it did, text fonts would have descenders longer than ascenders (because some of the former need more room to look nice) but the opposite is true&hellip; Things beyond looks matter when you&rsquo;re making a text font. Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>More important than the relationship of the x-height to the Em is the relationships between the x-height, ascender height, descender depth, cap height and numeral height(s). The x-height is the main player (at least in the Latin alphabet, but for example not in the Georgian) but it can&rsquo;t ignore the rest.</li>
<li>In a text font an x-height is usually around 60-65% of the ascender height, but it can go over or under that for specific uses: under, for let&rsquo;s say a large book set in a relatively large point size; over (by a good deal) if it&rsquo;s for a newspaper. The reason for this is that the requirements for reading shift a bit, depending mostly on size, but also other factors: in &ldquo;choppy&rdquo; reading like in a newspaper seeing individual letters clearly is more important, whereas when reading an immersive book in comfort the ascenders and descenders matter more (because they help define boumas).</li>
<li>Cap height is typically a little under ascender height, and descender depth is less than ascender height (sometimes by a good amount - check out Berling). Numerals can have a variety of schemes&hellip;</li>
<li>The big one&hellip; The vertical proportions are tied in to two other major parameters: the color (darkness) of the font, and the overall spacing. This is because each one of those three things points to a certain ideal point size range, and they have to be pointing at the same range. Smaller sizes require darker color, a bigger x-height and looser spacing; larger sizes, the opposite. It&rsquo;s hard to get a feel for what&rsquo;s a good balance, but it helps a lot to look at existing fonts by masters like Carter. Remember though that there&rsquo;s no precise formula, and personal taste can shift things quite a bit, especially when it comes to color.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Another factor that Hrant doesn’t mention is the ability to pack lines tighter. This is relevant in newspaper/magazine design because a multi-column text will have shorter lines and thus need less space between the lines* than, say, a book. Also, counter to what Hrant says, in large sizes (well above text size) the same requirement comes into play in, for example, a headline. This ties in with headline faces commonly being spaced tighter horizontally than text faces: they are also “spaced” tighter vertically, using the x-height and descender depth as the main variables.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d love for someone else to explain this in depth, but in general: 
1: At a certain distance (and this distance is closely intertwined with the length of the lines and whitespace around the text) lines begin to form a visual “mass” instead of just separate lines. 
2: In a book, with longer measure, it’s hard to find the next line if the lines don’t have enough space between them.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good points - there&rsquo;s certainly a lot more in here&hellip; For example that the overall width of a font also plays into what vertical proportions work well; and how the frequency of linebreaks (which is very high in newspapers) affects what role width ends up playing in economy&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, even in a book &ldquo;packing lines tighter&rdquo; matters, because it&rsquo;s not just a matter of collision. For example when the descenders (which are linguistically infrequent) are too long you&rsquo;re wasting vertical space that could be used to amplify readability in other regions (mostly the x-height, but secondarily the ascenders). I use the term &ldquo;apparent leading&rdquo;, which is what I think determines ease of &ldquo;line return&rdquo; when reading.</p>
<p>One thing you wrote that I&rsquo;m not getting is that #1. Is that an aesthetic issue?</p>

<p>I’m just observing that with too much leading a text block “falls apart”.</p>
