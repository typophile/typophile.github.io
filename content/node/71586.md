body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI am currently looking for a font that has a similar Art-Nouveau
  feel as the Belwe font. This means that it needs irregular sized B and A. I think
  this is called a high and low axis? \r\nAnyay we love Belwe but would actually like
  it to be a sans-serif. The shapes in this font are supernice but it is a bit too
  romatic with all the serifs.\r\nDoes somebody know a sans-serif which relates to
  this font?\r\n\r\nThank you for the help!"

  body: It should be even more modern or grotesque, but with edgyness. Thanks for
    the answers!

  body: It's the farthest thing from Art Nouveau, but maybe something like [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface]]
    is what you're looking for?
