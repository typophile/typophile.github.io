body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI have been given a font (.zip) archive from a client, and
  I am having a problem deciphering some of the files once it has been decompressed.\r\n\r\nI
  have tried both StuffIt Expander AND BOMArchiveHelper. I get the same thing with
  both extracting processes.\r\n\r\nOnce the archive is decompressed, I get Font Suitcase
  files and PostScript Type 1 outline font files (both of which I am familiar with).\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am NOT familiar with and the files that STUMP me are:\r\nUnix Executable Files(s)
  - some of which are Zero KB in size\r\nStuffit Expander.app Document(s) - some of
  which have \"afm\" suffixes after the file name(s)\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light
  on what I am supposed to do with these files?\r\nAre they corrupt files?\r\nAm I
  supposed to import them into FontAgentPro?\r\nHas my client archived them improperly?\r\nShould
  I Trash the Zero KB files?\r\n\r\nPlease help! Thank you in advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Often times, files that are identified as UNIX executable are simply files
    that OS X doesn't know what to do with (i.e., there is no application associated).
    AFM files are normally not needed on Macs.\r\n\r\nIf the files have are empty
    (i.e., zero kb), it probably means that the files are corrupt due to being transfered
    through a non-Mac file system (Windows, UNIX, Linux). Some Mac files (including
    suitcase files) have have a component called a resource fork. This is a special
    part of a file that is not visible to non-Mac file systems, such as Windows. If
    you move such a file to Windows and back, the resource fork will be lost, resulting
    in an empty file if all the data was in the resource fork, which is the case with
    font suitcases.\r\n\r\nIf you want to transfer font files from one Mac to another
    over the internet or via a Windows PC, you need to make sure the font files are
    placed into a zip or StuffIt file on the originating Mac before transfer and never
    opened on a PC at any point during transit."
