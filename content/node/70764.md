  the best way of finding the closest match? I've done it by eye but I think there
  might be a more accurate way. \r\n\r\nIf you can determine the closest match, please

  body: I used XeTeX to automatically match them, it says Georgia should be set to
    around 11.15pt. Well, it's the "MatchLowercase" option. It might or might not
    be a good calculation.

    take a look at that font and see how it looks. \r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"

  body: The option is "scale=MatchLowercase", I guess it's measuring the x-height.
    You can also use "scale=MatchUppercase" for titlings, I have no idea about how
    it will measure them.

  body: "According to the <code>fontspec.sty</code> file, <code>MatchLowercase</code>
    matches the <code>\\fontdimen5</code> TeX length, which is the x height. Similarly,
    <code>MatchUppercase</code> matches the <code>\\fontdimen8</code> length which,
    according to the <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=xetex_history\">XeTeX
    version history</a> is the cap height. I could not find in the XeTeX source code
    where those values are taken.\r\n\r\nWhen I check with Arno Pro SmText, <code>\\fontdimen5</code>
    is 4.02054pt and <code>\\fontdimen8</code> is 6.20084pt (with an em size of 1000).
    According to ttx, the x height is 399, not 402, and the cap height is  616, not
    620. On the other hand, the top of the bounding box of x is 402, and the top of
    the bounding box of X is 620 (values given to me by a FontForge script).\r\n"
