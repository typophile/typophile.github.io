  body: "Howdy Ant\xF3nio,\r\n\r\nI don't know of a digitization of this typeface,
    but do take a look at Stratum, desgned by Eric Olson and available through Process
    Type Foundry. Very similar, although more architectural in its curves. Actually,
    I prefer your version!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/stratum1/index.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stratum1_4428.gif]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAP"
