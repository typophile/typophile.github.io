body: It&#39;s time to ask again. I don&#39;t mean to be a pest, but what&#39;s the
  latest status on FontStudio/FontLab 5? <BR> <BR>Adam had said in a previous thread
  that it would be first quarter 2005. Is release imminent? Adam, can you comment?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Tim,  <BR> <BR>Note it&#39;s FontLab Studio 5. The release is coming closer.
    The application is very stable now, has some minor issues to clean up. We are
    intensely working on the new manual. I&#39;d say 4-8 weeks.  <BR> <BR>Adam

    is done in the wrong direction. (with 4.6)\r\nIf it's not dealt with yet, you
    have 4-8 weeks! According to a programmer friend who wrote a little program for
    me to fix it, this is easy to fix."
