    from Galapagos is the most similar I could find quickly. The R is about this style,
    though the inline lettering is a bit more hand-drawn looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "With more hunting I found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend/?refby=bowfin|Trend
    Slab Five]] from Latinotype. Seems pretty close if you invert the colors. \r\n\r\nAlso
    consider using outline added to a slab style to create a faux inline look. House's
    [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceslab|Neutraface Slab]] comes pretty
    close with the large counters on the P and R, but you would want the alternate
    E with middle arm centered, not low middle arm. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
