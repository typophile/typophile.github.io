  body: "Whatever this is, it isn't a common font, and maybe it's not a commercial
    font. I looked at some T-26 fonts, because I thought they had some square serif
    display fonts like this. I could not find your post, because your title is too
    much like so many other titles and if i found your answer, I might not be able
    to find your thread. Please edit your title to be something like \"Ripper - square
    serif\". That way those of us who try to solve these can find the thread again
    if we think we found an answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I scanned 'futuristic' fonts at MyFonts and came up with two that might be
    starting places if you wanted to try to modify something to look like your sample,
    but I could not find an exact match. Who knows whether this is custom or just
    an obscure font?\r\n\r\nSimilar styles: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/syndrome-brk-pro/|Syndrome
    BRK]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/zxa/|ZXA]]. Both of these would
    need some editing to create faux SC letters, or use some lower case as upper case,
    etc.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
