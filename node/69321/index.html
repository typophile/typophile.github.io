  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;d like to use something different from Goudy &amp; Goudy Sans as basics in this magazine. Mag is on the conservative side, nothing wayout, good legibility, but I&rsquo;m tired of looking at Goudy and Goudy Sans.</p>
<p>I would welcome suggestions for a good serif (pref. not Caslon) and a good sans, that would each go with the other nicely. I&rsquo;ve not had much luck in the inspiration department.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s a difficult field to get a handle on, because there are so many typefaces, and no one reference guide to help identify them all.
It would be nice to be able to go into a large news agent, or the magazine department of a large bookstore, find some magazines with interesting typography, and then sit down with the FontBook (published by FSI), and identify the typefaces, thereby developing a knowledge and stimulating some inspiration. However, the FontBook, large though it is, is far from inclusive. It should be augmented, certainly in the US, with printed specimens from the Font Bureau (its hardcover specimen) and H&amp;FJ (frequent specimen booklets), foundries which service a great many publications in North America.</p>
<p>Two of the largest online font retailers, MyFonts.com, and especially FontShop.com, can provide font suggestions focused by category and style, showing lots of specimens online.</p>
<p>Another engagement tactic is to acquire some old magazines (at flea markets, second-hand stores and specialty old paper stores, or even online), and identify the types used with the aid of Matt McGrew&rsquo;s <em>American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</em> (Oak Knoll), which is damn near comprehensive (only missing a few proprietary faces, such as Goudy&rsquo;s (Women&rsquo;s Home) <em>Companion</em> of the 1920s.</p>
<p>Speaking of Goudy, another immersion strategy would be to acquire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goudys-Type-Designs-Specimens-Typography/dp/0918142059">Goudy&rsquo;s Type Designs</a>, by the man himself, and try and track down digital versions of the fonts online.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am currently going through this phase of magazine redesign&hellip;well its more an art direction of one specific issue. There are so many ideas I want to apply. I found writing down ideas and filtering them down to what I want to communicate often helps me with which fonts to choose.</p>
<p>Another good way is to actually lay out fake text with fonts you wish to put together. Print them out and see if that helps to refine your choices. I hope the deadlines are not daunting for this project. It&rsquo;s a long path but one that is rewarding in the end.</p>
<p>Good luck with your search.</p>
