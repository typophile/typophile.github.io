body: 'I have a company which is an e-business consulting service specializing in
  B2B &#40;business to business&#41;. Our logo and letterhead are designed in Frutiger.
  I&#39;m looking for a nice/ contemporary/clean/easy to read typeface for correspondence
  which will compliment/go well with the Frutiger letterhead. I&#39;ve attached a
  file of our logo and tag line.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve received some suggestions but
  have not found one which stands out for me. Any suggestions - &#40;please also include
  weight, etc.&#41;  <BR>or what I should be looking for.  <BR>Suggestions so far
  include:  <BR>Universe  <BR>ITC Officina Sans  <BR>ITC Officina Serif  <BR>ITC Franklin
  Gothic  <BR>ITC Conduit  <BR>Icone or Breughel or Meridien  <BR>Thanks,  <BR> <BR>Roger

  body: I can&#39;t see the BMP - try embedding a GIF or JPEG. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard
    to pair something with a neutral face like Frutiger - especially a text face,
    since that has to be pretty neutral too. Or you could go crazy and choose something
    completely different, like Eidetic or something. <BR> <BR>But safer would be something
    with serifs, but plain ones. Which could mean slab. What about Caecilia? A little
    too humanist though. So maybe an Egyptian, like the 505? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: For what it&#39;s worth, I believe Meridien was also designed by Adrien Frutiger.  Bringhurst
    recommends it with Frutiger in <i>Elements of Typographic Style</i>.
