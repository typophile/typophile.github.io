  that have the <strong>same upper-case \"a\" as the Monotype's \"Neo Sans\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nI
  found nothing with the help of Goole or searching in Typophile's Forum... so if
  someone can help me, that would be very nice!\r\n\r\n<strong>Thank for your help,</strong>\r\n\r\nFlorian"

    Did you try searching for something similar at Dafont? (Best solution is to license
    the font, after all.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeoSansSample_5062.gif]"
