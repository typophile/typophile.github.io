  body: I think that your typeface choice needs to reflect the kind of clients you
    want to work for and the identities you want to create for them. Your interest
    in Helvetica and Din along with Max, Soho, and Neo Sans suggests to me that you
    need to do a better job defining the image you want to project before you make
    a type choice.
