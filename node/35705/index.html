<div class=commentbody>Ravel -
I make my PDFs from Quark. If I have not "embedded" the font - then it looks screwy.
In Illustrator I couldn't find any "preference" to allow this. So, from my own experiences, I know that if it is a TYPE 3 font, or Letterhead's new Open-type Type Font - those will not embed. I've needed Type 1.
I suggest you have that PDF open on another computer that does not have the fonts you use - and take a look at it. If it is as you designed it, then you should be fine for the printer. And if not, please check your fonts for Type 1, and if that doesn't work, please look towards Adobe for the answers.

If that's the case the Adobe reader may have problems to calculate the anti-aliasing of the text. But that is just a screen problem. It will not print this way.

What is is supposed to look like?
Have you got the fill as an overprint, if so has it got any trapping, is there a stroke applied to any of the characters, has that got overprint?
The ideal for this would be to have no overprint on the fill (and overprint on a fine stroke).
How does the pdf print as separations?

<div class=commentbody>It's just an on-screen rendering problem. As soon as it goes to (a modern) RIP it will be trapped automatically. What you could do to make absolutely sure that it won't be a problem, you could either mark the black text as overprint in Quark's attributes palette. Second alternative is to do it in Illustrator and give the black text a thin outline of the same colour and set the outline for overprint.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Select the type that is causing the problem, then look at the attributes window (making sure you have the fill box to the front), I suspect that the overprint box is not ticked, leave it unticked; if you are concerned there is a trap option in pathfinder alternatively add a fine stroke (0.125pt should do it) to the type, then tick the stroke as overprint, this will ensure that a mis-registration shouldn’t leave a white area around your type. Claus is correct most RIPs will deal with the trapping, for peace of mind ask the printer to provide you with a proof, even a post-rip pdf, which you can check and sign-off before it goes on press (you should do this for every job).

<div class=commentbody>I agree that it's probably a screen rendering issue but (silly question maybe) have you tried printing it out yourself to see how it looks? Even on an inkjet?
Also check your settings when saving your Illustrator file as a pdf - make sure it's press-ready.
I think you will may readability problems with black on a deep red regardless of trapping issues. </div>

I didn't say font rendering. The Reader will also smooth curves (if you don't turn it off in the preferences). This works fine in a color space like RGB. But if you use spot colors you will get exactly the results that was shown here. Just try the same document without spot colors and the problem will be gone.
But again, these are all screen problems. It has nothing to do with trapping or the way this will come out in print.

Ralf, I wasn’t referring to your comment, but to Sandro’s original post.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maraschino_OP_5041.jpg]
In order to get rid off the effect in a screen pdf try ticking overprint, but this is <strong>not</strong> what you want for your print pdf.
I suspect you are viewing this with the overprint preview, try viewing with just preview.

<div class=commentbody>I had the same problem with PDF files generated in Illustrator/InDesign CS2 and opened in Acrobat 7. I merely experienced it as a previewing problem and not a printing one, don't worry.

That just happened to me on a poster. Beautiful blue background - the preview showed white lines going through it - but the job printed fine...
I had never encountered anything like it before - and hope I never do again - it was stressful to say the least...</div>
