  Hoe Acorn press\r\n\r\nhttp://users.bestweb.net/~bpress/briarpress/museum/2ironhand/smithcin/smithcin-m.jpg\r\n\r\nit
  was owned by Parsons School of Design for years, until my great uncle, who was director
  of design there retired and they gave it to him. He tried sending donating it but
  i think for some reason was unable to. \r\n\r\nQuestion being...does any know the
  value of these presses? or the rarity? \r\nit is located on Staten Island and I'd
  have to move it, which would be pretty intense figuring its made of iron, and I
  live in Cincinnati. \r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\n"

    this but I can probably assure you that it is worth quite a lot of money. It is
    a dying trade, and unfortunalty the equipment needed to produce such beautiful
    pieces of print is also dying out and is very hard to come by. I am from England
    and I am always on the look oout for places that hold these machines for public
    use. Its usually a case of sweet talking a university. \r\n\r\nI have never bought
    one but I have bought a few book presses. Not of the size you are looking at with
    your letter press, in fact only a4 size and just under, and these I can say set
    me back a small fortune. \r\n\r\nIf you find the right collector then you could
    probably get quite a good price, but why would anyone want to part with a piece
    of history like this. Unless of course it doesnt fit in the appartment :)\r\n\r\nMatt"

    \r\n\r\nAlso looks like these guys have one - http://www.museumofprinting.org/Collection.html
    - if you're going to Typecon you could ask the curators to do an antiques-roadshow
    style estimate for you. My guess is that you won't get much for it, as it will
    cost whoever takes possesion of it $000's to transport it you may end up paying
    them to take it away ;-)\r\n\r\nSi"

    prettier of the handpresses. My next favourite is the Clymer Columbian. You know
    the one; all serpants and eagles on the counterwights.\r\n\r\nI can't say exactly
    what the price would be on the press, because I don't know what size the platen
    is. As an example a smaller one: 13x16-1/2 platen could sell for anything between
    $3000 and $5500, depending on how mych value the seller puts on it. Anything in
    that  spread would be a reasonable price to pay.\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

      \r\nI have been told that the platen size is 17x24 (i think...not positive,
      I'm gonna measure it when I go to take photos of it though.) Anyone have any
      ideas of how i could move it from NYC (practically) to Cincinnati?"

  body: "If you move it yourslef, a pickup should do. Whether you move it yourself
    or have with a freight company it is best to go to where the press is stroed and
    take it apart. An iron handpresses whatever type is fragile. The cast iron is
    old and brittle and easily broken. Any of these type of presses in their assempled
    state are very vulnerable since the boss and bed are heavy and the legs very delicate.
    I have moved one press twice. On the second move the press was the property of
    a buyer and they didn't break it down. The movers smashed it up badly before it
    even left my driveway.\r\n\r\nI would place it on two pallets: one for the heavy
    bed and boss and another for the legs, ways etc. It is bests to carry the miscellaneous
    nuts and bolts away with you in a separate container. If any of these things are
    lost it is nearly impossible to replace them since the threads in most cases are
    of an odd count and specific to the maker.\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't put you
    off, but it's best to be aware of the pitfalls.\r\n\r\nBest of good luck in your
    move.\r\n\r\nJim [img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    been informed is a somewhat rare size, being that most of the Smith Hoe Acorns
    still around are 22x30 or somewhere around there. I have more photos of it here
    http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v180/becker513/Letterpress/\r\n\r\nif anyone
    is interested, or could help me determine an approximate value, that would be
    amazing. Thank you.\r\n\r\n"
