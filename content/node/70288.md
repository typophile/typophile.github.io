  body: "This is the emblem of the United States Marine Corp. If you do a Google image
    search for 'USMC' you will find plenty of versions of this emblem.\r\n\r\nNote
    that the corp members usually shorten their motto to \u2018Semper fi\u2019, and
    you may find more instances of the emblem if you search for that instead of \u2018Semper
    fidelis\u2019."
