  of a \"Dockers Workbook\" celebrating one man (union leader Walt Cunningham's) life
  on the docks of Hull between 1950's-1980's. \r\n\r\ni have been looking everywhere
  for a nice clear legible serif typeface to  use for my body copy , i found one that
  i loved FF Scala Pro Regular http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_pro/
  it works n perfectly with the ethos of my type having been use in books depicting
  \ democratic revolutions/movements and in Museum booklets.The elegance of this typeface
  is exactly what i need but don't have the  \u20AC 299.00  to purchase it on a student's
  income. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had any alternatives to FF Scala with
  a more friendly price tag. or any other typeface what would communicate perfectly
  the struggles of a working class movement which have been in mostly forgotten. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any response\r\n\r\nMatt Russell\r\n\r\nmattrusselldesign@gmail.com\r\nwww.mattrusselldesign.net"

  body: "Are you sure FF Scala fits the \"working class\" ethos? I guess it does have
    some such attributes, but it also seems a bit too mannered to me here (look at
    that \"a\" for one thing). Something like Bookman (even though I personally don't
    like the way it looks) or Cheltenham (which I do like) might be better. Or do
    you think slabby serifs are helpful here?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, yeah just looked up Cheltenham and love it. The only reason i thought
    FF Scala was a good decision was because of it's previous uses seem to work pretty
    well in displaying political and democratic issues.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Matt, FF Scala has been used for many subjects - I have seen art and recipes
    books set in it - and it isn't a \"democratic\" or political typeface per se (*).\r\n\r\nIf
    you're stuck with the idea of finding a typeface related to the subject of your
    book, or to a particular cultural climate (the union struggles in Hull in post
    II world war Britain), why don't you look, for example, for a book typeface used
    in that period in your country?\r\n\r\nYou could try to have a look at the classic
    Monotype catalogue set by Stanley Morison or at the Penguin social essays published
    in 50/60/70's.\r\n\r\nEric Gill's work has a strong, unorthodox connection to
    socialist ideas in XX century Britain: perhaps you could try to have a look at
    his Aries, Golden Cockerel or Johanna serif types.\r\n\r\nOr, more simply, try
    to look for a typeface from Britain's typographic heritage - Baskerville and Miller
    comes to mind.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n(*) Martin Majoor on the origins
    of Scala: \"FF Scala is named after the Teatro alla Scala (1776\u201378) in Milan.
    There were two reasons for this name: FF Scala was made especially for a concert
    hall, the Vredenburg in Utrecht, and the design has it roots in around the time
    Teatro alla Scala was built, the mid-eighteenth century\"."

  body: "thanks for all the feedback i have looked into Johanna. \r\nI have looked
    into the Monotype catalogue previously and they did help.\r\nI wanted to stay
    clear of Baskerville due to history of being created for a upper class market
    and it's like to Cambridge University and it's connotations of dignity and it's
    common use to day with university studies. Not to say i don't like Baskerville
    (great typeface) but just feel as if would be slightly hypocritical to the narrative.\r\n\r\nI
    have a meeting with a manger at GF Smith's (paper) tomorrow morning and his father
    owned the print company that printed the handbook's and all the forms for the
    dockers so that could really be a positive move forward.\r\n\r\nThanks again for
    all the help,\r\n\r\nReally appreciated "
