  the M and S but the R does not match.\r\nI've also found space age matches the S
  and somewhat the R but not exact\r\nand 7 days matches the M and S somewhat as well...\r\nI
  just can not find a font to match all 3 or even the R correctly.\r\nThinking it's
  a mixed and or modified use of fonts... \r\nanyone know this font or is it going
  to be a mixed / modified font like I'm thinking?\r\nthanks in advance for any help\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_msr_01100030_4050.png]"
