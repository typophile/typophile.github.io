		<div class="commentbody">OK, here&#39;s an amateur disagreeing.  <BR> <BR>Times New Roman is a great text face. Like Caslon, Baskerville or Garamond it will not wear out its welcome. It is just often wrongly used. For example on American letter size paper it, as a very condensed face, produces lines that are way longer than ideal. According to Bringhurst, the ideal is around 66 characters per line, and Times at 12 pt on letter paper with one inch margins is way longer than this. Courier is actually better on such a long line.  <BR> <BR>Minion is a Garamond with large x-height and also quite condensed, which is perhaps why it is so useful and used. Is it too condensed? Does it pull this off less well than Times?  <BR> <BR>I guess time will tell. <BR> <BR>I think the issue of freshness applies much more to display type and overall design than to text types.  </div>

The Courier l.c. alphabet at 12 pt. is 186 points wide. According to Bringhurst&#39;s table an alphabet of this width set 36 picas &#40;6 inches&#41; takes up 68 characters.

		<div class="commentbody">JFP, you beautifully describe Minion. Thanks! Your observation that Slimbach&#39;s ambition was to be usable where Times is usable is insightful.  <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t mean to say that Minion was a copy of Garamond, only that Garamond seems to be its point of departure; it has calligraphic touches and opens up the a and e, etc. But there is still a noticable resemblence to Slimbach&#39;s Adobe Garamond - a more beautiful face, but not as adaptable. &#39;Myfonts&#39; classifies Minion as &#39;Garald&#39;, which I guess is the term I should have used.  <BR> <BR>As you are the designer of very impressive Sabon Next, I would love to hear what you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Minion! <BR> <BR>Hrant, of course Courier is not a text face. It is a typewriter face, but I find it telling that it is still widely used on letter sized paper. I much prefer the European A4 paper, which is narrower; but even it is wide. I would be interested whether Courier is still used in Europe for legal work, etc. <BR> <BR>I think there is a gap for some enterprising designer to do a better very wide face for correspondence on letter or A4 paper.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">55 to 65 characters per line is the result of readability studies from the 60s and 70s, but also of the work from Jan Tschichold before that and even before the old Italian typesetters did it right intuitively. It has been proven that, because we read not single letters but by jumping in saccades over the printed page, that too short lines and too long lines are obstacles for the reader. Although this depends strongly on the content &#40;a lexicon could have shorter lines as you&#39;re not reading a longer line but scan for information, a letter could have longer lines because it is shorter than a book text and -- sometimes -- more personally involving&#41; and proportion of the medium itself, the basic rule applies to letter-sized and A4-publications as well, which is why on a standard letter page I almost never use the full width but try to proportionally find a good place for 55 to 75 cpl :-&#41;.  <BR> <BR>And yes, Courier is, if the margins are chosen correctly, pretty much exactly 55 to 65 characters per line on A4 in 12 pt. It&#39;s not a highly accurate prophecy of the printed page, though, as Courier and such are monospaced and a proportional typeface will behave a bit differently -- but I think all in all it&#39;s a solid enough guess to work practically. But of course you can achieve the very same effect these days with any other proportional font by just modifying the size margins accordingly -- it&#39;s nicer to read and you can actually use a proportional font &#40;the text will, of course STILL flow differntly in Quark and InDesign, but at a Word-Document using the same typeface and the same characters per line should be just as accurate, if not even moreso than the Courirer-technique.  <BR> <BR>Courier, these days, is best use ironically and, of course, it&#39;s perfect if you want to make a letter look as if written by some kind of bureaucracy -- people actually read a letter printed in such a shabby Courier-Font more intensely asthey suspect/expect that it&#39;s official :-&#41;. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">joseph, i agree overall. helvetica is not really meant to perform as a text face though i&#39;ve seen it done well in lighter book weights. over all it&#39;s a great workhorse though because it walks the line between text face and display face. this makes it great for setting headers as well as moderate amounts of copy.  <BR> <BR>my point here though is that there is a classicism in the realm of design that is so often over looked or missed. this happens when people so easily drop something because it&#39;s not cool anymore. the beauty of helvetica is that it&#39;s already been not cool for such a long time. so much so that it&#39;s become an ambiguous part of the world and it&#39;s communication. there&#39;s a lot to be said for a typeface that has worked itself so deep into the fabric of communication that it goes unnoticed. saying helvetica is overrated is like saying bread is overrated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t think I agree with you there, Jay. To the best of my knowledge, Helvetica has never really been so uncool. Yes, people stopped using it for a bit in the 90s, but now it is as cool as ever! It is back as the most trendy typeface. IMO, Helvetica is loaded with meaning, as the de facto Swiss modernist typeface. If you need something classic and somewhat invisible and neutral, Univers is a better choice, I think, not Helvetica. Semantically, I think, Helvetica conveys a yuppie lifestyle. We see it a lot in Vancouver, because it&#39;s a yuppie city! It&#39;s trendy! <BR> <BR>Helvetica is not really suitable for setting continuous text at all. The letters were designed so that they wouldn&#39;t cohere well together - they are so individual and self-contained. The forms are terribly homogenous, making word recognition rather tough. Helvetica is simply not a good everyday workhorse. There are too many jobs that it won&#39;t do well in. <BR> <BR>I think serif types are more invisible to the average reader. They don&#39;t notice it as much. If you use a sans, then they immediate associate it with &#39;modern&#39;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">keith, helvetica was designed in the mid 1950&#39;s it is the predecessor to typefaces like adrian frutiger&#39;s univers. it was an attempt to create something to compete in europe with akzidenz grotesk. it was the typeface to end all typefaces in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s then it fell out of use in the 80&#39;s because it was so popular. only to come back into use in the late 1990&#39;s because of the post modern aesthetic. now with the revival of modernism it has maintained a foothold with young designers because it is such a call back to institutional design of the past. <BR> <BR>as far as it&#39;s robust use there are many older and wiser typographers then you or i that would disagree with you. the fact is that it has been used to set copy countless times. i agree with you that it&#39;s not the best text face out there but it&#39;s got a pretty damn good track record for a san serif. and that&#39;s not really open for debate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the very reason why Helvetica was so popular was because it had a hell lot more attitude than the humble Univers, which was a contemporary essentially &#40;they&#39;re just a few years off&#41;. It wasn&#39;t something to compete with Akzidens Grotesk as such, but a &#39;new and improved&#39; version of it &#40;with all the nice bits stripped out&#41;. In a way, Univers could have been as popular as Helvetica if it was only a functional universal typeface that designers were after. But IMO, it wasn&#39;t like that. <BR> <BR>Is Helvetica robust? Of course not. There are a lot more robust typefaces than it. The counters are not very open, therefore it&#39;s prone to confusion. Sadly, they are used a lot for directional signage &#40;e.g. Vancouver street signs&#41; and it&#39;s not the best choice, functionally speaking. <BR> <BR>A typeface with a good track record doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s necessarily an inherently good typeface. It just sold well and it was just one of the few that was available on most typesetting machines. Letraset also made a lot of Helveticas &#40;I have a whole drawerful under my desk right now&#41;. It was a default font on the Mac. So it&#39;s never the sheer goodness of a typeface that makes it popular. <BR> <BR>&#62; to compare kievit to helvetica is a bad comparison it&#39;s like comparing &#62; optima to futura. one is ultra humanist while the other is ultra &#62; geometric. it&#39;s like apples and oranges. you may like oranges better &#62; but they don&#39;t compare well out side of your bias. <BR> <BR>Really? I don&#39;t think so somehow. Kievit is a much &#39;better&#39; typeface for reading of any long continuous text than Helvetica, because of its humanist forms - the letters flow into each other effortlessly. So, when you have a criteria established &#40;say, compare Kievit and Helvetica for the setting of the contiouous text for an entire book&#41; then of course the result is obvious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">helvetica is much more popular then universe because it is a better typeface. i love adrian frutiger and he&#39;s a great type designer but univers falls short. it just looks awkward. it ,as well as helvetica, were reaching for the same thing and helvetica just did a better job of achieving it. like i said before i think this is apparent in it&#39;s track record and wide usage. granted i can jive with the whole &#34;80% of the world likes brittney spears but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s good, thing&#34; but i just don&#39;t think that pertains here and i&#39;m amazed that anyone would even go there. i mean for god sakes we are talking about helvetica here aren&#39;t we. it&#39;s kind of like saying the beatles suck because the never played heavy metal. but yet heavy metal owes everything to the beatles. <BR> <BR>is helvetica robust? yes. the counters are as open as i&#39;ve seen in a long time. i&#39;m not sure what cut or weight you&#39;re looking at, but damn it&#39;s pretty open in there. <BR> <BR>like i said before comparing a lineal humanist to a lineal geometric is drastic and you&#39;d have to be stupid in the head to think that a geometric face sets better for running copy then a humanist face but that&#39;s not my point. my point is and has been that helvetica is a great all around face it sets better then any other face we&#39;ve talked about for display and does a pretty bang up job at setting moderate amounts of text in book weight.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If Helvetica is popular, then it hasn&#39;t disappeared into the subconscious of the populous. --- Helvetica is decent enough for annual reports and brochures, but not for books. --- Let us all dust off our copies of Stanley Morison&#39;s &#34;First Principles of Typography&#34; &#40;I know you have a copy, admit it!&#41; --- People were &#40;are&#41; often confused about what Mr. Morison was talking about.

Helvetica isn&#39;t good for long setting of type. Now. I also think that Jay would agree with that. I&#39;m trying to read between the lines here. Helvetica is not a good read. I&#39;d go bonkers.

		<div class="commentbody">helvetica&#39;s counters are much more open than either gill sans or myriad. look inside the a and e. this is in part due to the fact that helvetica has such a robust x-height. helvetica is also much more metric lending itself toward a more open letterform. as far as univers is concerned it looks to be very close to helvetica&#39;s openness &#40;which is what i would have guessed&#41; i&#39;d call it a draw. but even here you can tell how much more proportional and nice helvetica is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Again I think we are talking about two different things. The measured openings of the shown letters are much larger for Gill &#40;Myriad&#41; than they are for Helvetica &#40;Univers&#41;. However, the lc a &#40;Hel&#41; is pinched and so appears less open that does the Univers. The modulation in the Univers characters &#40;as Keith pointed out&#41; humanize the shapes. Myriad is just plain open. Gill, well, I have a personal soft spot for Gill. Yes, it is a quirky little face and yes the lc a is somewhat odd &#40;as is the g&#41;, but it does have modulation &#40;humanist&#41; in it&#39;s favor.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">plain clothes, you are right that this becomes subjective at some point but then everything does. if we want to take that route we should place a booth down on third ave. and start asking random people what they think. univers is just not as handsome as helvetica though. it also has awkward kerning pairs. it looks much more fragmented then helvetica when it&#39;s set. but both helvetica and univers are very similar and set well for display as well. i just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a competition between which is nicer looking. helvetica takes the cake hands down. as far as the whole which came first it is in fact helvetica. <BR> <BR>the counters size and openness are the same thing unless we want to declare otherwise &#40;which i&#39;m cool doing&#41; the fact is that the counter &#40;the enclosed white space&#41; is in fact greater within helvetica.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">no in fact readability becomes subjective too in ways. if you had been brought up reading san serif you would prefer it to serifs. the germans for instance used to read in black letter not roman and became very accustom to it. the fact is that the human mind is adaptable and over a brief period of time it can learn to read any style of type fluidly. readability is only slightly less of a weak argument to subjectivity because it takes a bit longer to change patterns we are already accustomed to. any one born from the 1950&#39;s on has come across a fair amount of both serif and san serif type as text and can handle themselves quite well in both arenas. <BR> <BR>and as far as saying there is no such thing as a typeface that can walk the line between display and text... please. you probably also believe that a chair can&#39;t be stood on but only sat on. that&#39;s pretty limiting and dry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you&#39;re both right, in a way. If it is legibility you&#39;re after, then Tschichold still is the right source to go to. If you typeset a book, you cannot do any better than with the rules he came up with as they&#39;re based on the experience of the hundreds of years of printing and setting books since the Renaissance. And Fraktur has gone down the drain because it is LESS readable, sorry -- the oh so distinctive letterforms are a pain in the arse, frankly, they&#39;re TOO inividual and different and thus went away &#40;well... that and that Hitler dude finally found out that his effing glorious new German letters actually were based on a Jewish calligraphic form &#40;Schwabacher Judenletter&#41; and thus went back to the classic Roman form in the 40s&#41;.  <BR> <BR>However, type is also about conveying and expressing or even evoking emotion, and here is where Tschichold, Morris and many other traditionalists fail us when we&#39;re trying to get the job done. Surprising the reader, shoking him, evoking an emotional response is exactly the contrary of what typography in Tschicholdian sense was all about. Instead of being a neutral faceless conveyor belt that doesn&#39;t react or interpret or even interact and play with the text he&#39;s given, we&#39;re suddenly in a very different arena of intuitive and emotional exploration... in the world of the Fleckhausen and Weingart and, yes, David Carson and all those before and after him.  <BR> <BR>So while Typography in the narrow sense is a craft that ONLY is concerned with legibility, these days I&#39;d opt for deciding what the ACTUAL JOB is -- conveying information or emotion -- and thus decide if legibility is my main concern or just maybe something else. And there still is a world of differnece between the pro who breaks the rules but still obviously does so with purpose and a guy like Carson, who doesn&#39;t know the rules but was so gifted that for a time it didn&#39;t really matter much at all and finally those guys who don&#39;t know the rules and aren&#39;t gifted either and who hurt our eyes with bad flyers and leaflets and posters and CD Covers...  <BR> <BR>:-&#41;</div>

As it was, his choice of font for what must be considered the first modern terrible attempt at Corporate Design wasn&#39;t all that well-informed and the letter design wasn&#39;t based, as surmised on Runic &#40;Germanic&#41; letterforms but on Jewish letterdesigns. Which, I think, is a colossally funny and equally sad irony -- funny because the Nazis were even too stupid for THAT &#40;and still are, all those skinheads still using the blackletter aren&#39;t even realizing that they&#39;re imprinting themselves with a Jewsih design... I really really love these stupid tossers&#41;, sad because under the banner of this design hundred of thousands of Jews were killed.  <BR>As it stands, Blackletter is historically poisoned as &#42;the&#42; fascist letterform, whether that is right or not, fascism is deeply culturally imprinted... and thus it is these days only used by Skinheads and Goth Bands &#40;and don&#39;t get me started on the Gothic Movement being left-wing before thelate 80s and now operating on kryptofascist symbols... grrr...&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;But I have to ask: how exactly do you  <BR>&#62;know this?  <BR>From the top of my head I read a study on legibilty done in the 70s in Germany. There were various letterforms tested, Walbaum Fraktur among them. Most readers qualified the letters as incomprehensible and too different, too difficult to decode. We&#39;re just not used to them anymore. Whether the argument that distinctive letterforms actually enhance legibility might be argued as well, that would make Luc&#40;as&#41;&#39; Jesus loves you the most legible font ever -- node for node for node ;-&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Functionality is neat, but in design, it isn&#39;t everything. Sometimes pretty things are so damn unfunctional. I drive an old Volvo from 1967, and it is quite the infunctional car, rust, the brakes are tough as hell, it basically sucks the fuel directly from the stations without seeming to drive inbetween the fuelling up-sessions, no servo steering, primitive gear... but man, I love this car.  <BR> <BR>Same with typo. Sometimes the wrong stuff is just what you need to get a message across. As Spiekermann said: There IS no bad type.  <BR> <BR>I just used ISONORM Mono from Fontshop -- in a remixed version -- for a brochure for a philharmonic orchestra, mixed with GaramondPro. The Garamond in itself simply looked to pat for classical music, too obvious a choice and so I went for one of the most awful typefaces this side of the moon and despte the fact that you basically have to manually space every word, it adds a primitive and uneasy quality to the page that the clean and perfectly legible Garamond simply lacked. I was surprised myself that it worked so well -- the Isonorm font was lying around on my HDD for years on end without being ever used -- but it so effectively went against the classical-music-clich</div>

It&#39;s probably actually giving too much credit either way to that stupid housepainter anyway.  <BR> <BR>And he never fabricated any background -- the usage of broken scripts and the invention of the Suetterlin script for school &#40;also based on runic forms&#41; -- was simply some fascist bollocks. When finally someone noticed that hey, we&#39;re using a kind of letterform actually co-devised by the very people we&#39;re trying to commit genocide to, the whole of Germany instantly switched back to the forms of roman typefaces used in the 20s, even although in the middle of the war. I have read correspondence from a soldier in Russia &#40;the father of a prof I was transcribing letters from Suetterlin to computer-text for&#41; that switched </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; I read a study on legibilty done in the 70s in Germany. <BR> <BR>Not that I have too much faith in its actual results &#40;most legibility studies are full of holes&#41;, but I would be interested in learning of any &#34;relative insights&#34; in that study, so if you could track down a reference for me, I&#39;d appreciate it - thanks. <BR> <BR>&#62; We&#39;re just not used to them anymore. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s certainly true, especially in the caps &#40;which would really have to be changed for mainstream use&#41;. But there&#39;s an interesting line between feeling comfortable with something in the short term, versus benefiting from a change in the long term. What I&#39;m saying is that getting used to blackletter might help eventually - in a similar way that learning FontLab is a good idea even for long-time Fontographer users. And really, for the blackletter revival that I have in mind, all you&#39;d need is an open mind. <BR> <BR>&#62; Whether the argument that distinctive letterforms actually enhance legibility might be argued as well <BR> <BR>Well, you can&#39;t doubt that information is conveyed through contrast &#40;difference&#41;. On the other hand, a given glyph can indeed be too &#34;distinctive&#34;, and it&#39;s very interesting -and fruitful- to consider how these opposing forces balance. My own stance is this: as long as a glyph doesn&#39;t distract you into saccading to it from <i>another</i> line, or regressing to it after you&#39;ve already read past it, it&#39;s fine. <BR> <BR>&#62; Functionality ... isn&#39;t everything. <BR> <BR>Agreed 100%. <BR>But I&#39;m totally opposed to the &#34;there is no bad type&#34; relativism. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Jay, I would ask you to please: <BR>1&#41; Calm down. <BR>2&#41; Open your eyes to the hypercomplexity of human nature. <BR> <BR>&#62; no one cares about typography anyway <BR> <BR>This is essentially true. <BR>Graphic design in general. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In response to HD and Tiffany I must say that it truely is about the expression and the concept in communication. Does the typography fit the message?  <BR> <BR>I have questioned the importance of what we read. If what you are reading is interesting to you, I have no doubt that you will be able to read it. I used to read really cheap paperback imprints of classic novels. Was the typography good? No, but I was interested in the content, and that was enough. As was stated earlier its the message &#40;the reading of it&#41;, not the typography that dictates readability.  <BR> <BR>On the relativism note, I think that to say relativism isn&#39;t a valid form of critique, even in relation to history is to deny all valid philisophical thought of the last half century. More importantly it denies the nature of design and communication in the modern world. Nobody wants to limit our communication options to the Bible &#40;in blackletter&#41; the way it was before relativistic thought. Relativism has given us the power to value certain things above others. A privilage we all obviously cherish. The key to relativism is to know when it is a valid approach to criticism, and when a more concrete and formal approach works better. But then it would be a good idea for anyone to learn how to approach critique in an intelligent and informed way.</div>

I&#39;m sure you know where I&#39;m going with this. Hrant mentions craftsmanship. That is at the heart of my thoughts. Aren&#39;t designers, designers, because we can take content and give it form? I didn&#39;t know it was okay not to care. So the next time I typeset something I&#39;ll just set it at 6 pt with 40p columns at call it a day. My point being &#40;as high and lofty it may sound&#41; that if we know better shouldn&#39;t we do something about it? Maybe I won&#39;t read it, but someone is going to read it. Shouldn&#39;t I take the time to apply what I know and understand? --- Yeah, craftmanship, what a novel idea. --- John. You&#39;re right. If I know something has the information I need, I&#39;m going to trudge through it, no matter what, to get that information. But you are wrong to think that it is okay not to care.

		<div class="commentbody">We ALWAYS care because we are designers/typographers. Why have text at all if we don&#39;t expect anyone to read it? Craftsmanship is the heart of graphic design and typography. Whatever happened to it? I expect every bit of text that I design to be read. Yes, there are times when text is just &#39;art&#39; or &#39;illustration&#39;, but more often than not we use text because there&#39;s something we need to communicate. And I know I have to make every effort to making it 1. legible and/or readable; 2. typographically correct; 3. reproduces well technically; 4. appropriate for its purpose; 5. inviting to read; 6. visually pleasing, etc, etc. Not in any particular order. If we don&#39;t even care if some text is going to be read or not, then we&#39;re not doing our job properly. I &#39;design&#39; a Microsoft Word template the same way I design a book. There&#39;s no difference except maybe the context of use and the limitations of the software. I pay attention to details no matter how trivial the task might be. That makes me a designer &#40;though I admit I&#39;m more of a typographer than a &#39;cool&#39; graphic designer... :-P &#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">no reason, just wondering if it was you or an icon or whatever.  <BR> <BR>I agree with you about the readability issue. If there is language worth reading it should be set properly. Back to my reading experience I was reading a hardbound book recently and I was very happy with the way it was set, it allowed me to read faster and longer becuase of the typography.  <BR> <BR>You are all right that as graphic designers we need to communicate information, and as designers that means making it understandable and easy to digest. I didn&#39;t mean to argue that point. Being professional and compitent dictates a high standard of typographic and editorial quality. Deffinately. <BR> <BR>I suppose that my comments stem from my desire to explore different avenues of communication. Finding different ways of reaching. I dont wan to forget the past, but looking forward to new and more effective ways of accomplishing the task of communication by building on what we know instead of being limited by it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a twist on the Nazi abandonment or censor of blackletter that may not have been mentioned here &#40;getting hard to follow so I may have missed it if it was&#41;. As Germany expanded its holdings, so to speak, it found its proclamations, rules of order, etc were not well understood by the populace of the countrys they were occupying. This the result of the blackletter, which was unfamiliar. So they invented an excuse, one more false indictment of the Jews, and changed to roman faces and condemning the use of blackletter. <BR> <BR>It is not the blackletter form that is hard to read, the letterforms are quite legible, it is more often the general setting in text, poorly rendered, which hinders readability. <BR> <BR></div>

I never heard an official reason for the abandonment of the blackletter. All I heard is that behind the scenes the Nazis learned of the original Jewish Schwabacher source of their Frakturschrift and corrected that error.  <BR> <BR>And I&#39;d say that from todays POV, blackletter is kind of hard to read as people aren&#39;t used to it anymore -- and many people, at least in Germany have such a strong emotional response to it due to its usage during the fascist regime that the emotional aspect overwhelms the readability. The typeface isn&#39;t neutral anymore -- and a good text typeface shouldn&#39;t be too special or emotional, imo. </div>

Hrant cites Bain and Shaw and I believe that is where I saw the mention of it. <BR> <BR>Where, by the way, is the evidence for a Jewish Schwabacher source that would not already have been known. <BR> <BR>To say that a &#34;good text typeface shouldn&#39;t be too special or emotional&#34; is indeed a humble opinion. Beatrice Warde, Morison, et al would agree. But they had a product to sell, did they not?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;&#62;A reference -which I already refereced- that&#39;s both tight and deep:  <BR>&#34;Blackletter: Type and National Identity&#34; by Peter Bain and Paul Shaw.  <BR> <BR>OK, Hrant I should have been clearer. <BR>I noted your reference, but the argument that both you and Gerald say is presented there &#40;Blacklettter was dropped by the Nazi&#39;s in order to facilitate communication with populations in occupied countries&#41; is obviously only half of the debate. <BR>The counter argument &#40;that blackletter was dropped because the Nazis discovered its jewish heritage&#41; has been mentioned, but no references have so far been given. <BR>I would like to read up on both sides of the argument. <BR> <BR>I should say that I have no particular axe to grind on this one, I can&#39;t really see it changing my views about the Nazis either way, but it is an interesting historical triviality. The thing is, I just don&#39;t feel comfortable with the Bain &amp; Shaw explanation. <BR>Unless I&#39;m missing something &#40;and I might well be, as I have only the comments in this thread and the results of some late night googling to go on&#41;, the Bain &amp; Shaw argument just doesn&#39;t ring true - it seems so unlikely. <BR>What they appear to be saying is that in order to communicate with people who were not used to blackletter, the nazis dropped the use of blackletter, not only for documents intended for foreign populations, but so completely that they had to make up a lie about  blackletter being jewish in origin &#40;a lie that could only make them look foolish given the fact that they had previously promoted blackletter&#41;. <BR>&#40;continued...&#41; <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now in many cases, documents intended for foreign populations would have had to be translated to the local language anyway, so why not just drop blackletter for documents which were not in German. <BR>This act would have been far more practical, could have been easily explained from the nazi point of view &#40;inferior foreigners not capable of comprehending superior german letterforms&#41; and wouldn&#39;t have required the nazis to pretend to admit to have been fooled into adopting a part of jewish culture. <BR> <BR>The Bain &amp; Shaw explanation, then, will need to come up with some pretty compelling evidence to convince anyone that the extraordinary events they describe did actually happen. Anyway, thanks for the reference Hrant, I&#39;ve ordered the book already, but I would really like to know more about the counter argument, and if possible to read something by someone who has read both sides, and done further research to try to resolve this. </div>

The Bain and Shaw book is not a study attempting a popular understanding. It is a compilation of articles by many of the current fraktur scholars. <BR> <BR>The article in question is &#34;Fraktur and Nationalism&#34; by Hans Peter Willberg. It is fully footnoted. In regard to the Schwabacher... &#34;this theory could have had no connection to the book industry, since access to the printing trade at that time was absolutely forbidden to Jews....they could not have had any influence upon the previous 300-year growth of textura and fraktur. The Nazi argument was therefore totally unfounded...The real reason for the abolition of fraktur was power politics. In 1941, Hitler&#39;s armies were victorious on every front. The future world power had to adapt to the &#34;world type&#34; &#40;roman&#41; in order to exercise its power.... fraktur was viewed as the writing of the occupier...&#34; <BR> <BR>Why is this so hard for you to imagine?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;&#62;You are making all these arguments without having read the book <BR>True, but I&#39;ve been very open about that, and the arguments I&#39;ve made have been in the form of questions raised. The way the position offered by Willberg in Bain &amp; Shaw&#39;s volume was presented in earlier posts it seemed to me that either something was not being said &#40;which is why I&#39;ve ordered the book - so I can see the arguments for myself&#41; or that the position was dubious. Now, remember, other posts in this thread mentioned an alternative explanation, and I would like to know more about that. I can&#39;t be satisfied that I have any idea of the truth of the matter unless I have at least given both sides a fair hearing. Part of that process is to question everything and consider the answers. You can rest assured that if I ever manage to find some research that goes against Willberg&#39;s view, I will be equally questioning and dubious about that.  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;What is this? The Bain and Shaw book is not a study attempting a popular understanding <BR>You have read my comment out of context. This was part of a small aside to Hrant suggesting that a revival of blackletter may be helped along by its role in an interesting historical situation. If, as you suggest, this was not the case, then so be it. I never suggested that it should concern Bain &amp; Shaw whether or not the truth was intereting to a wider audience, and I would never suggest that one should twist the truth to make it interesting.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">One other reason, not yet mentioned here, is that the resistance printers were putting out counter-information. This was extremely threatening to the occupation. The resistance could use blackletter to their advantage and fake documents or they could use roman to enlist nationalistic sympathies. Somewhat of a problem for the occupier. <BR> <BR>I have the special issue of the French literary magazine _Le Point_ titled &#34;Imprimeries Clandestines,&#34; a documentation of the French resistance printers that was released at the cessation of the war. Several of the printers pictured in the photo documentary were executed for their efforts. <BR> <BR>Per anyone&#39;s interest I&#39;ve put up a half dozen of these photos over at PPLetterpress, the Yahoo group site.</div>
