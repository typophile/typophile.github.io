  It is a bold italic, but, what makes this different from a Palatino bold italic
  is (at least what I can tell) the lower case 'y', and the serifs.  The usual lower
  case Palatino italic y has a v form with the y's tail coming off of the upper part
  of the right ascending part of the v. What I'm looking at has a lower case y that
  is like a Palatino Nova y, where the tail comes off the bottom of the v, and looks
  more like a Times font. \r\n\r\nHere is an image of the font in question below.\r\n\r\n
  Thank you    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5954.jpg]"
