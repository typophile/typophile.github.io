  <BR>I will make a family of different widths. This is the most condensed. Should
  all glyphs compress and extend with the alphabet? What do you think?

  body: Thanks for the comment. I&#39;ve tried to curl the brackets but no success,
    I have to work it and do some spacing. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s wrong with the guillemets?

    <BR>&#62;Yes, I think... but I&#39;m not sure if I understand your question.  <BR>
    <BR>I mean it&#39;s kind of hard to make for example an  extended period, exept
    by spacing... should I just leave some glyphs identical in different widths of
    the face, like punctuation and math signs, if yes, which ones? <BR> <BR>Which
    ampersand?

  body: The guillemets, I think they&#39;re too narrow and too tight. <BR>The ampersands,
    they&#39;re all nice. But maybe the regular one &#40;the first from left to right&#41;
    is the more useful. <BR> <BR>&#62; should I just leave some glyphs identical in  <BR>&#62;
    different widths of the face <BR> <BR>Now I understand your question. In fact
    it&#39;s a good question. I guess my answer to this question is no, don&#39;t
    make glyphs identical through different widths. <BR>An extended typeface usually
    should be slightly heavier than its lighter companions, for optical compensation.
