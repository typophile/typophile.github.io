body: "I'm creating my own specimen sheets for my font collection and would like to
  have a couple of characters in caps as well as lowercase quite large to help quickly
  identify the typeface. What would be the best letters of the alphabet to use - I'm
  planning on only using 2 or 3 in u/c and same for l/c.\r\n\r\nI know each typeface
  can be characterized by some unique character, but for an overall I'm wonder if
  R might be one of them. Possibly M?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any ideas."

  body: "As you said, every typeface has its own distinguished characters (for example,
    Museo has the U). And it further depends if it\u2019s a serif or sans serif style.\r\nThat
    said, you could check Mike Yanega\u2019s excellent guides in order to select useful
    characters:\r\nhttp://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php\r\nhttp://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php"

  body: "RGage. \u2018M\u2019 is not bad either. It depends a little on whether you
    want glyphs that help to <em>identify</em> the typeface, or rather glyphs that
    convey the <em>typical look</em> of the typeface. For example, characters like
    \u2018Q\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 or \u2018&\u2019 often are very suitable for distinguishing
    one typeface from another, but are not so common in real life text like, say,
    \u2018n\u2019, \u2018i\u2019 or \u2018t\u2019.\r\nYou also will want to include
    both characters with ascenders and descenders. Typically, letters occur within
    words. That\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t sort by case, but mix: \u2018Mag Ref\u2019
    or \u2018Red Gag\u2019 (instead of \u2018MR aefg\u2019 or \u2018GR adeg\u2019)."

    that\u2019s more than 2 or 3 letters\u2026"

  body: "thx Ricardo for the links .. very useful. Definitely the ballpark of what
    I was thinking .. MagReb looks good to me with the l/c g, versus other combinations.
    I might throw a number in there to break up the sound/word. 5 might be my choice\r\nthanks!"
