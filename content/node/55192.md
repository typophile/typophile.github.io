  other designers.\r\nDesigning for the agricultural industry is always a challenge.\r\n\r\nThe
  client has selected these two logos as his preferences so far.\r\nThe logo to the
  left - Client would like to see JD style bolder (Any recommendations for a bolder
  style / I\u2019m thinking more masculine?)\r\nThe logo to the right - Client sees
  a crown / I was going for more of an abstract wheat / arrow / agriculture + technology
  (moving forward)\r\n\r\nI am limited to the yellow / green colors. The company is
  a seller of John Deere equipment plus other industrial brands.\r\n\r\nAg stands
  for the agriculture customer base the customer serves and tech is for the technology
  that is a key part of their products and services they offer."

  body: I am looking for suggestions for a masculine typestyle that could represent
    agriculture and technology merged too.

  body: Looks like the client is trying to become John Deere through the color choices
    and initials! As far as fonts go...hmmm. Univers Black? Perhaps Frutiger? Helvetica
    Neue? Those would provide kind of a masculine feel while also hinting at technology
    without being too overbearing if used carefully.

  body: I'd also see if you could perhaps steer the client away from the painfully
    obvious John Deere colors. It just seems too - copy-cattish? Try to find some
    different color schemes. Also as far as agricultural imagery go, your leaf/crown
    is a bit too sharp - makes it seem unfriendly. Try to add some curves to it, make
    it less angular. Anyway, that's my thoughts. I'm sure I'll have more.
