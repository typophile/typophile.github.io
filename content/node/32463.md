body: "\r\nI've been freelancing so long it seems horrible. I've been offered a FT
  job with full benefits for $14. an hour - that's under 30k. The work is not hard,
  and not interesting at all. It's production work for a small publication - who still
  uses Quark 4 and PageMaker.\r\n\r\nIs the pay really bad? opinions?"

  body: Calculate how much the benefits are worth over the month and add that into
    the pay -- if they're going to pay full medical and dental (and depending on your
    situation -- you need some serious work done on your teeth or have a high prescription
    bill), it might be worth it.

    in Anchorage like?

    $700. Car (Subaru) insurance is cheap - about $600 a year. \r\n\r\nThe benefits
    will cost me $164. a month - no dental. Ironic, since the only medical care I
    need is dental work. "

  body: Can you relocate? Maybe you could find something more lucrative somewhere
    else. Alternatively, you could take the job to tide you over until you find something
    better, either in Anchorage or elsewhere.

  body: If a 1br averages to $800 the job market should probably support a little
    more than $14/hr for junior professional work, but not much. Take the job on the
    condition that you won't do any unpaid overtime so that you can freelance on the
    side to make ends meet, and then in a year or two go job hunting with a bigger
    portfolio and full-time professional experience on your side.

    make up much, unfortunately.  \r\n\r\nThe standard of living is pretty high here
    in Calgary -- 1 br are going for around $1,000, and car insurance would be probably
    $3,000 (I'm assuming you're in your twenties) -- yet there are still a few places
    that are only willing to pay $11-14 for junior designers.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say,
    they're having a hard time filling those jobs.  ;-)"

    \ My hours would be 9pm to 5am.  I'm a night person ... but that's extreme, even
    for me. \r\n\r\nThere is no way this job will produce portfolio work - I'll be
    laying out classified ads, for the most part. \r\n\r\nMostly, I hate the old software;
    I feel like it will hinder my progress as a designer, not help. Does anyone on
    the planet still use PageMaker?\r\n\r\nAK"

    $14 is junior money in Canada (remember, our dollar is only 80% of the US one).
    In Toronto it would be starvation wages, but in rural or small cities it would
    be a going rate.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good thing to do for a year or so as a stepping
    stone. Some places won't put much value on freelancing on a resume. "

  body: "I grew up in Anchorage. Besides wanting to get out of there (weather, darkness,
    ice, etc.) there aren't a whole lot of options for designers, at least when I
    left in '95. (There were a few agencies, and a few small design firms...) \r\n\r\nThe
    upside of being in a smaller market is if you can get enough clients, freelancing
    is way more lucrative, and there's not as much competition up there. If you want
    to do design work, this is not the job to take. If money is tight, get another
    part time job to supplement your freelance until it picks up. Good luck..."

    if I hear correctly, you can get nearly $14 an hour sweeping floors.</em>\r\n\r\nWell,
    not quite. Our local bottle shop pays $11 to start, and the Blockbuster vid kitty-corner
    from them pays $9.50.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I had an errand to run in one of
    our \"with-it\" neighbourhoods (Inglewood), and where one of the stylish furn
    shops was looking to hire part-time.  \r\n\r\n(I'd like something like that these
    days, to provide a little more steady an income and, more importantly, get me
    out of the house a bit, as it's one of the few things I do hate about freelancing.)\r\n\r\nSo
    I took a toodle through the shop, attired in a reasonably clean pair of jeans
    and fairly trendy jacket, discovering that they charge out their designers at
    $85/hour (with a \"free\" hour if you buy $500 or more in product), but only paying
    $15 to staff.  Did I drop off my r\xE9sum\xE9?  hahahahahahahahaha\r\n\r\n(And
    they even had a dress code of tailored black pants, high heels, and white blouse!)\r\n\r\nHow
    terribly stylish....\r\n\r\n"

    the only time of day I look forward to.  \r\n\r\nOh, and BTW, I love the cold,
