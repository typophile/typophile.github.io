  font but had no luck. Second isn&#39;t familiar either.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39284.gif"

    And what i see? Americans developing russian fonts. lol. wow. Anyway, good job.
    But this font looks like font used in paper &#34;Pravda&#34;. I know someone said
    this already. They really look like font from beginning of XX century. oh and
    in cyrillic regular and bold you have wrong N. Should be turned other way. <IMG

    Kirgizstan vs. S.Petersburg is REALLY interesting idea lol. Made me laugh. Thanx.

    only to learn alphabet. Especially if you are not russian. My advice: if you are
    going to study russian - don&#39;t do it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> It&#39;s a big challenge. Well, it&#39;s hard language but it&#39;s
    rich language. For example correct version of text written by Joe should look

    <BR>Will tell the _Institut d&#39;&eacute;tudes slaves_ in Paris about it. <BR>Not
    so many non-slavic languages speakers do cyrillic fonts... <BR>I don&#39;t know
    much about all this, but you could check if you&#39;re missing the odd Ukrainian
    or whatever language character &#40;Bielorussian ? Other ?&#41;. <BR>And if you
    feel like it, maybe do a &#34;mock&#34; cyrillic font as well &#40;latin font
    inspired by cyrillic writing&#41;. <BR>In France, Dabasse did a Remont/PeMonm
    &#40;Repair&#41; font...  <BR>But you should ask really the Paratype guys &#40;link
    must be either paratype.com or paratype.ru&#41; or Pyrus/FontLab. '
