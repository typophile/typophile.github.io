<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>A few questions/thoughts that might help get the ball rolling:
1. Everyone loves Gotham, and so do I. I'd like to keep the typeface for my name pretty neutral (probably a geometric sans). Do you think there's a better alternative? Is overuse of a typeface a reason to reconsider using it?
2. What do you think about the size of the mark in relation to the type? Currently, the weight of the type is equivalent to the weight of the M's serifs.
3. Kerning good?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>First off, I like your mark very much and have since you started using it as your avatar.
Secondly, I wouldn't be too concerned about Gotham being overused - if you feel it fits, stick with it.
2 suggestions:
- maybe try a different placement for your name, it doesn't seem to glue right now.
- Have you tried using a lower case 'c' in your name?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>1. Perhaps I shouldn't comment because I dislike Gotham greatly. Geometric sans are plain ugly to my eyes. I would stay with a sans face, but one with a bit more life and movement in it for my taste.
2. I think the mark is too large, however I don't know what you are trying to achieve and so I can only make comments based on my own prejudices & personal preference. I believe there should be a bit more of a contrast between the two elements. Both are strong and dark and the overall feel is heavy - not that this a mad thing, it could be what you want.
3. Letter spacing is fine.</div>

<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I would suggest a couple of tweaks:
Line up the mid point of the cap height in the name with the centre of the circle in the 'r'.
Then move the name much closer to the 'rM' mark, leave less than half the space you have now.
Kerning-wise, maybe the space between R and T in robert needs tightening just a bit.
Lower case 'c' definitely worth a try.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all your comments.
@seb: What's the protocol for McK names? Is there a hard and fast rule?
@Graham: For me at least, the difference in styles between the mark and type is enough contrast (a rich, curvy Bodoni vs. a simple geometric sans). I also like the fact that there is something to tie the two together (the weight of the type and the weight of the mark's serifs).
@David: I will definitely try that alignment. Sounds like it will work. I'll also look at tightening up the RT.
@typerror: Ideally, I'd like to have both a vertical and horizontal version of the logo, so I will be looking into both.
@chris: What about the type turns you off? Any suggestions?
@penn: I see these really black Bodonis with super skinny serifs all over the place. I would also worry about having the logo fall apart at small sizes if I were to thin out the serifs. I'll give it a try, though.
I'll post the results of the revisions. Thanks again to everyone who has helped out so far.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the top version with the name underneath, the name with a lower case 'c' works nicely for me too.
Maybe the mark needs to be nudged to the left slightly?
Still not crazy about alignment of the name in the bottom version; have you tried aligning the baselines?
Think it could work well.

The old ones aren't being removed, he's simply adding the new revisions as attachments as the top. the first attachment up there is the original, 2nd one is the 2nd, etc...
My favorites are the first of the second upload and the third of the third upload.

<div class=commentbody>The top over/under may be mechanically centered but to me, as Sebastian said, the rM could go to the left a bit.
Just for grins, have you tried reducing the caps until they match the weight of the serifs... a subtle continuity/contrast may appear. I always try and create this kind of relationship when using type and lettering together.
Also, what about a sort of stair step. Dropping the name to below the serif of the M, and running to the right. That way you still have your horizontal but it is below... and maybe even extending the serif to run over the top of the name.
Just quick thoughts Michael</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hate to be a party pooper here, but I'm going to do it anyway.
I don't see any reason to use Gotham with that good-looking mark. Is it an attempt to complement with little contrast? Well, you've got conflict in extra bold versus light, conflict in sans versus serif, conflict in italic versus roman, conflict in upper/lower versus all uppercase. Frankly, the name just doesn't look at all like it belongs with the mark. I'd like to see you switch out the Gotham for something a little less conflicting.</div>

I view contrast a good thing. They play off of each other, set each other off, relate to each other and ultimately work as a unit as a result of their disparity.

I've got no problem with contrast. However, in this case, it's too much for me. There's absolutely no relationship between the two, and that doesn't work for me. Seems like the unsolvable problem here is finding a way to get the two elements to come together as one. Could it be that they're repelling each other, for all or some of the reasons I mentioned above?
But, alas, I am not the authority, and surely there's some subjectivity in every critique.
I can't be the only person here with this opinion. Am I?

<div class=commentbody>I'm having a hard time deciding if guiyong's post is a joke or not. I hope it is.
The mark is beautiful and actually looking through all the revisions you've made, I like the very first lockup version the best. Although, I can see that there are problems with the alignment and compatibility the two elements.
Have you considered that maybe the mark doesn't ever need to have your name next to it? It's strong on it's own. I think you could work it out so your name never has to be part of the logo. Your letterhead, for example, could have the mark in one corner and your name with contact info along the bottom or in another corner. That will make your mark into a beautiful icon that needs no explanation. (I mean icon in the "iconic" sense, not as in something you would click on your computer)
Also, Gotham is a really wonderful typeface to use in your identity, but I think it would be beneficial if you experimented with others to see what happens.

Do not get me wrong. You are not wrong. We are coming at this from different points of view with like minds. I am just trying to push, as are others, in other directions to get him to understand these very relationships. Finally Analisa made the point above that I made in the first thread, does he even need the modifier handcuffed to the mark!
Discovery will happen and then we can meet for beers at your place in Wisconsin, and sow some seeds of dis/content on the hillside!
OK Mike?

<div class=commentbody>Whoa, Mr. Yong! Take 'er easy, 'eh? I think what we've got here is a communication breakdown...that and the aesthetic you have shared is rather shocking to us in the West. But if it works in Tokyo, let 'er rip!
Mr. Clark, I like your offer. Beer on the hillside sounds terrific. Although Virginia does intrigue me as well...somewhere down the road I know there's a Shennendoah camping trip happening for me and the fam.
But back to business...yes, push to understand relationships...
Mr. Clashmore...would you humor us with a look at a little less clash? How about looking at Gotham italic... you might have to force the angle on it a bit if it doesn't match the mark, but I'm curious to see what it looks like.
What I'm seeing in your mark is bold, fast-paced, adventurous design. Then I get to your name and I see you slammed on the brakes, turned off the car, and became very serious about being as uninteresting as possible.

<div class=commentbody>Hey Gui,
I really liked your logo treatment, but to me it felt a bit empty (bland?). I reckon you should give it a bit more zing to make it really pop. Do you know what I mean? For example, I noticed that you've really only used two tones: purple and green, maybe you should try to get a bit more colour in there; more warm colours and maybe all of the cold ones as well.

<div class=commentbody>use the same baseline as the rM for your name. I think that'll work. watch the weight of your type as well... It feels like your competing between the logo and your name. if you can go lighter, explore that route.

<div class=commentbody>Having the right stem of the "M" as the ending statement keeps your logo within an invisible box. Contains the design within itself. Personally, I like it better that way. The added arms from the K causes unwanted tension on the right. I like it as a concept, Ninja, but I don't believe it causes as strong an impact as the left stem of the "M" being deleted. I don't see too many type treatments where an "r" is completing another form. Nice work.

<div class=commentbody>Actually, it's the right half of a Cyrillic zhe, but oh well, I still think it looks cool...makes for a slightly wider "box," which gives room for the text beneath it.
Another thing I was thinking might work would be to put a small white space between the vertex of the "K" and the right stem of the M. Or you could stylize it a bit more....I just thought it was kind of a crime to have a name like McKenna and not use both capitals of the last name.
But your choice. I like the logo either way. The ligature of JT just looks like a backwards pi, so I always admire people with cool initials...

<div class=commentbody>Leaving it alone (the mark by itself, without the name) is also a good solution. Yes, I liked the addition of the K for the same reasons mentioned by the ninja, and that had a lot to with how it worked better with the name included. This is <cite>your</cite> mark, and it's a great one. Thanks for opening it up to a lively discussion, and hearing out the opinions of your peers.
(My previous post, btw, was simultaneous with your post about your decision to leave it alone. I didn't mean it as a retaliation.)
