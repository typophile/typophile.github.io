body: This isn&#39;t exactly my first bitmap font, but it&#39;s the first I&#39;m
  creating as a complete font for public distribution. I&#39;m more of a pixel-pusher
  than a graphic designer, so I&#39;d appreciate any feedback you could give on this.
  It&#39;s intended as a small screen font for use on high-resolution displays. <BR><img

    be recognized. the shapes are very crisp and nice, and the whole font is quite
    clear for its size.  <BR>'
