body: "I'm after a font that I can use in a logo where the text is going to be one
  word and all lower case. I like some of the very bold sans serif fonts I've seen
  lately, especially the ones that are less roundy (like helvetica) and more squarish.
  \r\n\r\nI have no idea how to describe them so please look at the facebook logo
  font, but the one I like more is the [[http://blog.eachday.com/2007/8/1/bubble-logo-insanity|eachday]]
  logo.\r\n\r\nOn that same page look down at the technorati logo, you see what I
  mean by a slightly square sans serif font? But I think the technorati font isn't
  designy enough for what I need. I need something that is obviously a display font,
  not a book font and that's why I like the eachday logo.\r\n\r\nPlease ID the eachday
  font, and possibly suggest others that are like it, maybe even more design like?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Hey Goran, I spent yesterday evening looking at Soho! And yes what a classy
    font. I would love an opportunity to use it professionally, it's a bit too refined
    for the look I'm after, but thanks a lot for the post
