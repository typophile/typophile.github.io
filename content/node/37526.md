  Club uses recently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone already mentioned it looks like a modified
  Avant Garde Gothic, but i think I've seen it elsewhere also, so I thought it might
  be a font on its own.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner_5678.jpg]"

  body: "I think this is Avant Garde Gothic with its alternate characters, not a modification.
    It's been discussed many times here. (The R seems wrong for Avant Garde, but maybe
    the heavier weight?)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
