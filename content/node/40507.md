  \ I'm trying to decide on a display face and I thought you nice folks might offer
  your suggestions.  Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:\r\n\r\n- The site is going
  to serve a wide age group, so it has to be regal enough for crusty old professors
  w/o being too dull or pretentious for students.  I'd like to try to capture some
  of the romance of higher education while keeping a sense of humor about it (closer
  to \"Animal House\" than the New England Journal of Medicine).\r\n\r\n- The site
  itself is going to have a dynamic identity that will accommodate the name and colors
  of a particular institution.  Therefore, the typography will need to be unique enough
  to create a cohesive identity, w/o completely swallowing up the institution's psuedo-identity.\r\n\r\n-
  It's going to be web-based, so most of a page's text is going to be in some system
  font.  I haven't decided on serifs or not, but most likely either Georgia or Arial/Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI've
  just started looking around, so maybe you all can help me get started.  I like what
  they're doing over at the new <a href=\"http://spacecollective.org\">Space Collective</a>,
  but I think that display face might be too playful.  Any suggestions??\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n"

  body: ">  I haven\u2019t decided on serifs or not\r\n\r\nDecide on sans. Serifs
    are harder to read online for most people. The only thing to deal with is that
    sans generally have larger x-heights, and therefore should be presented at 80%
    the default size. (Do not specify points in your CSS, and then people using all
    browsers will be able to change to a larger size if their eyes require it.)\r\n\r\nYou
    can use graphics or sIFR to make the headings and subhead distinctive with nice
    fonts."

  body: "Thanks for the replies, but I think my original post may have been unclear.
    \ I'm not looking for a system font (I'll likely use sIFR on the site), I just
    wanted to make the point that the typeface I select will have to compliment either
    badly-rendered Georgia or badly-rendered Arial.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: Lessee, you want to appeal to stogy old professors & hip young students. Last
    time I looked, you couldn't get even modernists & postmodernists to agree on an
    aesthetic, and that's just one small part of academia. I'd say the font you want
    is named <cite>unobtainable</cite>
