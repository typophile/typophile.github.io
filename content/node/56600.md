body: "Hi I've been asked to create a large panel in Illustrator, 118\" wide x 88\"
  tall. I need to leave about an 8 - 10 inch bleed on the ends (sides).  \r\n\r\n(I've
  never done any sort of print design, so please forgive me for the questions)\r\n\r\nHow
  do I set this up in Illustrator so that I don't design in the bleed space? Is this
  something I just measure out myself?  When I am finished with the design do I save
  it as a .eps file?  \r\n\r\nLastly, how do I find out what the PMS colors are in
  my design? \r\n\r\nThanks for the help, I appreciate it!!"

    what bleed\r\nspace is for. \r\n\r\nPMS colors are spot colors - e.g. if you want
    some words in a certain\r\norange, you can specify a particular Pantone orange
    for those. \r\n\r\nWith regard to how you should save the file (as well as color
    questions),\r\nyou should communicate with the printer who will print the panel.\r\n\r\nhope
    that helps a bit."

  body: "Thanks Begsini.  I found the PMS colors in my design and I'll speak to the
    printer and ask about what sort of file he needs to print.  \r\n\r\nIm a web designer
    so I'm not that familiar with printing in large scale.  Thanks again for your
    comment!"
