body: In romanian, first quotes must to be down and last up; the caracters for the
  down quotes is different from the up quotes. Why? Is a mistake or this is what the
  designer want.

    will show automatically. \u201EBeispiel\u201C, (99 66), if you write the \"Inch\".\r\nOr
    you can get this with ALT+0123, ALT+0147 manually on Windows.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Marius,\r\n\r\nI guess I see what you mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArnoPro_5543.png]\r\nThe
    Double Low-9 Quotation Mark (U+201E) is designed in a different way than the Left
    and Right Double Quotation Mark (U+201C/-D). I agree, this might look disharmonious.\r\n\r\nNot
    a problem with the Italics:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArnoProItalic_4324.png]\r\n\r\n(Arno

  body: "Quick workaround: Use \xBBguillemets\xAB \u2013 if I remember correctly,
    they may be used in Romanian, too. Plus, they look nicer.\r\nDirty workaround
    (if it\u2019s just for a couple of lines): Use the Right Double Quotation Mark
    and shift down its baseline."

  body: "Looks like the baseline quotation marks were based more on the comma and
    not the raised quotation marks. That's why they look larger and more upright.
    Not sure if this was done intentionally by Slimbach, or by someone else assisting
    in the production. But I agree with you, it looks wrong.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    did the production of Arno Pro and I was not sure myself. After further investigation
    it turned out this was a deliberate decision on Robert's part. (FWIW, in Garamond
    Premier Pro the baseline quotes are also different from the raised quotes)\r\nI
    discussed this subject with Robert and he agreed that the baseline quotes should
    be changed."
