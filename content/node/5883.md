  body: Incidentally, is that your own sample sheet? If so, you might like to know
    that it should be &#34;Zwieback&#34; and not &#34;Zweiback&#34;. For what it&#39;s
    worth...

  body: Yes, that was one of the early samples made for me using the template that
    I gave people. The <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a> was started in 2000, and it was quickly pointed out after a
    few months that I had the spelling wrong. It still works for ID purposes, and
    the newer samples have the right spelling. <BR> <BR>Thanks for mentioning it,
    though.
