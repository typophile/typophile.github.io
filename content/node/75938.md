  of the novel Musashi, written by Eiji Yoshikawa and published by Kodansha International.
  \r\n\r\nI could only find one image that showed it: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.worldlanguage.com/ProductScreenShots/102505-2.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  don't have a scanner or the book with me or else I would scan a higher quality photo.
  If you have access to Amazon reader, you can see more pages here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4770019572/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d1_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=14FRPYSG2GNJAVYAXHS5&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!"
