<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>my ceo to get rid of this logo?
http://www.greentube.com/v3/imgs/page/logo.gif
I'm currently working as an inhouse designer for greentube and I've already established myself as a graphic designer within the firm.
but the thing that's always been a thorn in my side is the logo.. Personally I think already a modernization would do enough. I think the bauhaus font is just outdated..
But how can I convince my boss to give me the permission to work on it?
any ideas?
cheers mike</div>

<div class=commentbody>Without knowing anything about the company history etc, I would just let him know about your thoughts regarding the logotype and make some new fresh proposals. That might give him/her a new perspective. Be prepared to explain your creations well, though. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with the previous thoughts... I think you have to create a vastly improved logo and present it to them. The key is to show it in situ, so show how it would look on the company's website, stationery etc., so it's a straightforward comparison that you can sit side-by-side the existing brand, and they don't have to imagine how it would look when applied to things. Not everyone is good at visualising how things will look, it's much easier for many people to see how it actually looks.
Good luck!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Word of advice (this has happened before): You should know that Typophile pages stay in Google's Cache for-like-ever, so if you don't want your boss being upset that when someone Google's for the company name and gets this page you might not want to leave the company name in that orginal post.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've had experience in selling ideas to senior management, if not in graphic design specifically, and the key is to make them "contribute" to the solution. If you just give them a bunch of options and ask them to pick one, they'll reject all of them.
What I do is present three options and make what seems to be an unbiased presentation of each: one that they can turn down flat, one that is "close but needs their input," and the one I really want. The one I really want I say is the ideal solution but costs too much, takes too long, is too radical, or whatever. The idea is that the executive will pick up ideas from the preferred solution (since executives typically don't like to hear that something can't be done) and transfer them to the "close but needs work" solution. That way, the executive feels involved and as if they've been particularly bright.
(Later edit: The first option, the one they can turn down flat, is critical here. Executives like to disapprove stuff.)
Then you go away to "incorporate" their suggestions, and the result -- amazingly enough -- is close to what you wanted in the first place, but with just enough variation to make the executive think they had something to do with it. In the second presentation, you spin the result as showing the executive's keen insight and valuable contributions: "Pat, your input was really valuable, and led us to look at things in a new way that gave us unexpected results, lowered cost, and shortened the time-to-design dramatically." And since they've already seen your preferred solution, it won't be a shock to them when they see it again. But it's absolutely critical that it looks like they had some input to it; they can't easily reject something they've touched.
This is very cynical, I know, but it works.
(Even later second edit: re getting permission, don't bother; just come up with the three options on your own. It shows initiative, and remember the cliche about forgiveness being easier to obtain than permission. If you think the CEO might accuse you of wasting company time working on a non-approved project, say you did it on your own time because you felt so strongly about it.)</div>

<div class=commentbody> > Although it doesn’t sound very Army. ;-)
Uh-oh. You read my comments in the MI poster thread. I hope it was clear that although irritated, I was still trying to make useful suggestions. Actually, there is something similar in the Army. I was an NCO; officers only think they run the place. We called it managing (or training) your officer.
Not that I’m trying to turn mikeb7 into a corporate Machiavelli, but there are some office politics that I thought of over the Thanksgiving holiday. (People who aren't corporate employees, feel free to roll your eyes in despair.)
1. Don’t spring the idea of a new logo on the CEO without preparing the ground first. If you surprise the CEO, the result is likely to be a corporate committee and you frozen out of the process.
2. Find out if the CEO is personally invested in the current logo. For instance, if they’re the corporate founder and the logo has been with the company since day one, or if the CEO designed the logo.
3. If there are any middle managers between you and the CEO, they will need to be appeased. Some might just have to be kept in the loop, others may feel they need to approve the designs before the CEO sees anything. Unfortunately, middle managers vary too much for me to offer any one formula.
