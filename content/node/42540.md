  body: "yes, kris, the article is only indirectly related. but it is related, as
    is chris anderson's concept of the long tail and what happens when the cost of
    reproduction of media approaches zero. again, i don't want to be the mediator
    (or presenter of one side to the other). \r\n\r\ni can say, however, that i find
    the per-computer license model frustrating and by its very definition bound to
    be violated. not from mean spirited scoff-law piracy but rather from inconvenience,
    ignorance, and economics. per-computer licensing is clearly a flawed business
    model. i'm wondering if there is a better one.\r\n\r\nsome of you may find this
    appalling, but as a young designer i used nothing but copied fonts without even
    knowing i was violating any laws or agreements. and i'm willing to bet that this
    is normal. i don't say this proudly, and you can rest assured that now i  purchase
    (oops... license!) legitimate copies of anything i need. i pass the expense to
    my client when possible, or i designate the annual costs as a normal business
    expense.\r\n\r\n( i was amused to recently see a request on typophile for barry
    deck's fontoid. \r\ni worked on the project at nickelodeon for which he created
    this. he had us all sign a document vowing never to copy, distribute, or use this
    font for anything other than the nickelodeon project. ever. that was my very first
    exposure to the issue of proprietary fonts and usage restriction. )\r\n\r\nas
    i matured and began to work more seriously with fonts and fontographers, and as
    i bought fonts i couldn't find, i began to more fully understand and respect the
    work that goes into all design and i began to actually read the EULAs and frankly,
    even while doing my best to respect the spirit of the agreements and restrict
    my usage to a legal context, i find the arrangement cumbersome and at times absurd.
    \r\n\r\nthere have been other threads on this list regarding the all too common
    practice \r\n( now waning due to technological advances) of sending fonts to printers
    or freelancers bringing fonts to work sites, etc. \r\n\r\nstudents and young hungry
    designers are the most likely to think \"i can't afford it\" or \"we already bought
    it so why shouldn't we share it\". it's hard for them to justify spending money
    again and again on files that are so easily and rampantly duplicated. as i explained,
    i myself had to gain a certain career momentum before i fully cooperated with
    the licensing system as it stands. these days, even if i find a font i want to
    use in my vast collection from years gone by, i'll find a way to buy it for a
    job. it's not difficult but it took a few years for the rationale to kick in.\r\n\r\nwe
    loan books, we share music, we invite friends over to watch movies, we make people
    dinner. we share things of value. this is a normal impulse and for a lot of people
    it is counter-intuitive to prohibit. and i think the font situation is aggravated
    by the very language of the license agreements. on most font sites every aspect
    of the transaction is called a buy - you \"buy the font\" - but in fact you are
    not buying, you're not even renting. you are licensing with restrictions. perhaps
    that should be made more explicit at the top of the agreement.\r\n\r\ni play by
    the rules, folks, but i wonder if there's another approach to this problem other
    than lectures on ethics ?\r\n"

  body: "Much of Typophile consists of professional type designers who make a living
    on type, so it's understandable that the trend would be to lean towards their
    interests.\r\n\r\nThe question is, in general, does strict technology based and
    legal based copyright restrictions actually favor the copyright holder as much
    as they think it does? It's obviously a complicated question with no straight
    answer. It also is likely heavily dependent on the particular niche industry we
    happen to be talking about.\r\n\r\n\"How many of these geeks and code cowboys
    create software? How do they propose making a living from said software?\"\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people make a living creating and supporting Open Source Software. The
    concept of open source does not negate a project from making a profit. That tends
    to be one of the myths of the open source movement. Does it apply to type design?
    Probably not as easily.\r\n\r\nIMHO, I think most software licensing is overly
    strict, and that most open source licenses probably aren't ideal for most of the
    industry, leaving the answer somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe,
    in general, about software licensing right now is the fact that much of it is
    licensed PER MACHINE, rather than PER USER.\r\n\r\n*I* am the one paying for the
    license. *I* should get to use it where I want. My computer is not paying for
    the license. It has no right to my software. \r\n\r\nI think Apple kind of gets
    this, even though they don't overtly state it. "

    couldn't agree more and I have argued this point on other threads in vain. As
    a single user with three computers and two printers, I resent having to pay individually
    for each workstation. Most EULAs cover a number of devices, say 1-5, which works
    just fine for me, but H&FJ among others does charge per computer. The argument
    was made that it is easier for the font police to monitor the number of workstations
    than the number of users and then the thread got ugly.\r\n\r\nI think that overly
    restrictive EULAs do nobody a service - designers will either not buy the font
    or will violate the EULA (knowingly or unknowingly). I really appreciate the foundries
    that make an effort to work with individual designers and not just major corporate
    clients or custom jobs. I am respectful of the hard work of the typographers,
    but only ask that they respect my needs as a user of their fonts. \r\n"

    consider that covered under a single computer license. Or are you ambidextrous,

    set of contractual rights and obligations that may be more efficient overall.
    So, if regulators find so called \"agreements\" overly restrictive, they can give
    consumers additional rights notwithstanding the EULA. It may not be in the interest
    of type designers, but it may be in the public interest."

  body: "Expect to see more differential pricing, based on either the amount of content
    in the font, or who's using it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there are already two price
    points for legacy and OpenType versions of the same typeface.\r\n\r\nCheck out
    Canada Type's CULA and PULA--different prices for commercial and personal use.\r\n\r\nThe
    font market will continue to expand, driven by factors such as better marketing
    by distributors, and more aggressive pricing by competing foundries from around
    the world. $5 fonts, $25 fonts, $50 fonts, $75 fonts -- more tranches, bigger
    overall sales volume.\r\n\r\n<em>there are free fonts and cc fonts out there,
    but is this really the best we can do ?</em>\r\n\r\nI'm afraid so, because these
    comprise the lowest tranche, and act as a gateway for users to then move up to
    commercial products. \r\nLook at what happened in the early 19th century when
    book publishers on the European continent went after the controlled UK market,
    offering a cheaper product and not paying authors. Before this was closed down
    by international agreements, it (among other things) had stimulated the book and
    reading market in the UK hugely, and brought prices down--as well as popularizing
    Byron and Scott throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe US ignored European copyright at
    that time, published European authors cheaply, with affordability boosting the
    reading rate in the US, again stimulating the commercial market, and allowing
    writing to emerge as a profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One problem of making a license per computer is that it is not clear what
    a computer is. For example I have a Powermac G5 and it has two internal drive
    bays (more recent ones have four). One hard drive has OS X 10.4.11 on it and the
    other has 10.5.2. For almost everyone this counts as one computer, not two.  Now
    am I entitled to put a font onto both drives and have that count as one computer?
    In this case I suspect no one would cavil \u2014 after all, I cannot use both
    drives and both operating systems simultaneously. But this a real problem for
    me with CS2, which I have a license for. It is currently on the 10.4.11 drive
    but I genuinely have no idea whether I am entitled to put it on the Leopard drive
    as well. And yet it is licensed for one computer, and, as I say, most people would
    consider the whole thing just one computer. (If the license is really for one
    hard drive then it should really say so.)"

    the 'per user' license concept instead. Alas, that means they have to give up
    concepts like DRM which they may or may not go for.\r\n\r\nI've always thought
    a 'dongle' approach would work. Maybe a bluetooth device that stores all of your
    licenses on it. No matter what computer you are on, as long as you have the license
    on the device, the computer will recognize it and launch the software for you.
    This gives the vendor the DRM-want, and the customer the flexibility of not being
    tied to a physical box."
