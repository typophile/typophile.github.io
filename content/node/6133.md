  body: mia madre e nona, nono sono italiani. <BR> <BR>and in Brooklyn the guys are
    cugins and the girls cuginettas... <BR> <BR>in Rome during AtypI the preferred
    hotel near the Colluseum had a bank machine with comic sans on the screen... and
    so did the Metro have signs in it but they replaced the Euro with a generic one.
    I guess they didn&#39;t like Euri&#39;s eye looking at them.
