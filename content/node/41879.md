  high word count. 1000 words + heads and images per A4 (UK) page.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt
  to give myself maximum designing space, I have been seeking a body copy serif font
  that will give a high word count whilst achieving good clarity and readability.
  To get the project off the ground have found that a version of Simoncini Garamond
  at 9/9.5 is OK, however have a budget to buy something offering an even better word
  count.\r\n\r\nJust wanted some advice on what other people are using or have experienced
  in similar situations.\r\nHave got it in my head that something like HTF Mercury
  might be the answer?\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: "Simoncini Garamod is still an essentially \"round\" face. As a general rule,
    the rounder the letterforms, the fewer characters per pica you get. You get the
    character count up by going to smaller setting size, and you retain legibility
    by having a larger x-height.\r\n\r\nOne font that really packs in the characters
    is Stone Print. It is pretty traditional though, and may not be appropriate for
    a business/scientific magazine. But so too is Simoncini Garamond. I assume this
    is an double-column 8-1/2 x 11 *magazine* & not a single column 6 x 9 *journal*.
    Another thing about Stone Print is that is won't read well when the measure gets
    over about 24-25 picas.\r\n\r\nQuadraat too packs in the characters, due more
    to it's large x-heigth.\r\n\r\nA slightly condensed font can help a bit -- Richard
    Eckersley, who was fond of narrow books, use to use Minion from the multiple masters,
    with about a 95% value for character width. Gave him a couple more characters
    per 25-pica line.\r\n\r\nBTW, it is the characters per line rather than the lines
    per page that really makes a difference with straight text. The resaon is that
    stories and/or chapters usually begin a fresh page, so the only time you save
    pages are those few times when, by the luck of the draw, a few lines force another
    the last page.\r\n\r\nAll this changes when you have to fit in images or tables,
    but not as much as you might think.\r\n\r\nI'd go with a slightly condensed font
    that has a large x-height, so you can set it reasonably small. In passing, while
    you probably wouldn't want to use it, Optima can be set very small & still be
    legible. I didn't believe it until I saw an encyclopedia Rich Hendel designed
    that had to really pack in the copy.\r\n\r\nOh, another font that might work is
    Arnhem; much more modern looking & business like than any Garamond. We set <cite>The
    Encyclopedia of North Carolina</cite> using Arnhem -- another Hendel design. While
    a roundish font, you can set it small & retain readability.\r\n\r\nFWIW "

    some time today testing out your suggestions and a few others of my own...\r\n\r\nI
    am creating a template for a 'non-creative' production team to work with and need
    the solution to be extremely rigid and user friendly - I was concerned that using
    a semi condensed font for page after page would need extra care and attention
    in use, something its not always going to get - but was getting resigned to looking
    in that direction - We are taking about people who would think nothing of throwing
    in a bit of minus tracking/kerning to get something to fit...\r\n\r\nFor those
    interested, bearing in mind in some instances I am calculating the text length
    on the info gleaned from the various websites and taking into account the fonts
    that I prefered - the following shaped up well.\r\n\r\nQuadraat gained about a
    line or two on the Garamond.\r\nArnhem is a nice font and will be conducting some
    further tests.\r\n\r\nBut the typotheque fonts Freda and especially Greta showed
    up really well. Greta looks like it will save up to approx 20-25% of text space
    (compared to the Garamond) + it looks really good as a body copy font. In fact
    I would recommend the pdf tester on the website as an extremely useful resource
    as I was able to set a paragraph of actual copy and alter the size and width.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again thanks.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    habit I need to keep at bay, for the most part. I don't claim to know a whole
    lot about typography either -- witness my <em>faux pas</em> with respect to Clearview
    Text, which Kent pointed out earlier. I don't see why Clearview Text (no less
    than 48 weights!) shouldn't be used for body copy. To quote some more from Terminal
    Design's website:\r\n\r\n<em>...every member of the family now contains small
    caps, oldstyle and lining figures in both proportional and tabular widths, arbitrary
    fractions, inferior and superior figures, and extended latin diacritical support.</em>"
