  who\u2019s designing his own monospace font for coding. For now, one weight and
  one style only, but he seems to have quite a few optical sizes in mind (probably
  without him even realizing what that means).\r\n\r\nThe designer/developer (Pablo
  Caro) explicitely asks for criticism, so he can take constructive feedback into
  account while developing further. His sample text settings were posted on [[https://news.ycombinator.com/|Hacker
  News]] (a popular forum for coders and programmers), where they\u2019re being discussed.
  By hackers. For typophiles it\u2019s anyhow interesting to read how programmers
  rationalize about type design, without the burden (?) of tradition and jargon: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6354396\r\n\r\nI
  fancied both communities \u2014 the type design pro\u2019s and the hacker type-n00bs
  ;-) \u2014 might find each other on this occasion. I cross-post the link to this
  thread on Hacker News, so that programmers could learn how typophiles discuss type
  design.\r\n\r\nThe original blog post with samples of the font(s) under discussion
  [[http://pcaro.es/p/hermit|is here]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hermit_11pt_3457.png]"

  body: "One of the first posts says:\r\n\r\nI hate to say this, but a font by a programmer
    makes as much sense as a database library by a font designer.\r\n\r\nSo true.
    However, if no one else is going to design a font in which 0 and O on the one
    hand, and 1, I, and l, on the other hand, can be easily distinguished, a programmer
    might have to. Also, for some purposes, programmers may require monospaced typefaces.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    typefaces are aesthetic objects, not technical ones.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I would
    prefer something based on Courier to a light line sans-serif made to imitate the
    aesthetics of dot-matrix faces."
