  this issue here :\r\n\r\nIs it bad to set a typeface to a non integer point size
  ? (ex: business card in Garamond at 8.5 pts or even 8.47 pts)\r\nAre there any technical
  problems related to this (postscript, press, etc.) ?"

  body: The short answer is that it's fine. The only potential drawback I can think
    of is that hinting tends to be designed for integer pixel sizes, but on the other
    hand it's been a while since screens were 72 dpi and pixels == points.

    pixels, and the hinting most probably follows suit (and doesn't just get ignored).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
