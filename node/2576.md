  body: I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a hand-lettered display face, based on the unique
    lengths of the serifs on the &#39;n&#39;s and the subtle differences between the
    &#39;s&#39; characters. Of course, I&#39;ve been known to be wrong before... <BR>
    <BR>Love that lowercase y.

  body: To get back to the original question, I hunted through my old PhotoLettering
    catalog and found a raft of closely related styles to this lettering by lettering
    artists by the names of C.E. Coryn, Tony Stan and Ed Benguiat &#40;!&#41;. One
    of Coryn&#39;s called Coryn Didot had a very similar &#39;g&#39; except it had
    a normal &#39;ear&#39;, instead of this straight line. The &#39;y&#39; was with
    a much longer, conventional tail. Which brings me to an observation about that
    y in the copy that Grant liked. Doesn&#39;t it look out of character? I think
    that was &#39;built&#39; &#40;mutilated&#41; to keep it from cutting into the
    artwork below. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much about how PhotoLettering&#39;s &#40;or
    their competitors&#39;&#41; types were designed and made, but my presumption is
    that customized versions could probably be ordered the same way you do with digital
    fonts today.  <BR> <BR>Did Dwiggins do film type? Or is that a silly question?
    &#40;I suppose a set of good drawings would be what you use for film type or metal
    type designs, in the era of this ad.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, if anyone has any old
    film type catalogs, that might be a place to look for something more like this
    type.

  body: Yves, if this is truly hand lettering, it&#39;s remarkably consistent.  The
    effect of the lettering in the ad isn&#39;t the issue, in my comment about the
    &#39;y&#39; -- it&#39;s just that that letter seems inconsistent &#40;stylistically&#41;
    with all the other letters &#40;See the &#39;y&#39; in the checklist copy? That&#39;s
    probably the normal y for this typeface&#41;. I also can&#39;t help feeling that
    it isn&#39;t a very attractive typeface, with its mix of rounded and sorta wedge
    serifs. The overall impression &#40;to me&#41; is a bit like ITC Fenice that couldn&#39;t
    decide what kind of serifs to use -- ruled, teardrop or triangular, so it used
    them all.  <BR> <BR>I realize such judgments are just my opinion, and I agree
    that this is wonderful draftsmanship if it is hand-lettered. If it was digital
    type, I wouldn&#39;t buy it for my collection, is all.

    like this font just because it isn&#39;t so supersmashingperfect and polished
    like most stuff i see in ads nowadays..  and it is so decorative too...   <BR>i
    guess i am being a bit romantic about this ad and a sucker for black-and-white
    design and old prints of Mr Rembrandt van Rijn. <BR> <BR>well...  what&#39;s my
    point?...   <BR>well...  just like a lot of music produced nowadays, it is so
    overdone and too clean and polished with no mistakes. shiny shiny no dust and
    perfectly perfect..  that&#39;s why i still love the Beatles..   listen to it
    with headphones and you will hear a lot of mistakes..   and yet it sounds brilliant.
    However i am not so fond of the digitalizing on CD of their music... <BR> <BR>and
    sorry Yves for bringing music into this forum! <BR> <BR> <BR>finally... yes i
    would buy the automatic Gas range font if it was digital...  so watch out Yanega...  i
    may give it a try..  making a digital version of it of my own...  and i promise
    you needn&#39;t buy it...   <BR>and Thanx for a great comment about the lettering
    and y&#39;s <BR>This is why i like being here at Typophile! Here&#39;s so much
    knowledge and interesting posts &#43; posters.. <BR> <BR>and i think the  y  rocks...  because
    it is so different from the others. even looks a little Hebrewish letter..'

  body: Whoa, Jack!  I said it was just my opinion.   <BR> <BR>No harm intended to
    you or anyone who likes it.  I like oddities in type at least as much as the next
    person, it&#39;s just &#42;this&#42; type that doesn&#39;t appeal to me. My favorites
    types are ones that look hand-drawn, but that doesn&#39;t mean I like ALL hand-drawn
    types equally well. In fact part of the problem for me is that is &#42;doesn&#39;t&#42;
    look hand-drawn, because it is so precisely done.  Goudy designs have &#39;irregularities&#39;,
    this one just has things that look out of place &#40;to me&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    OK for us not to be unanimous in adoring this lettering isn&#39;t it?  <BR> <BR>BTW,
    nice paste -up of my name . You went to a little trouble for that jab in my ribs.

  body: Clarification gladly accepted Jack. I kind of suspected as much, when I noticed
    the smiley in your post. I thought we were all friends here, but usually when
    I got called &#39;Yanega&#39; instead of Mike it was in work and/or in annoyance.  <BR>
    <BR>Some hand-drawn fonts I like are those by the late Phill Grimshaw &#40;Kallos,
    Obelisk, Tempus and a list of script fonts&#41;, Timothy Donaldson &#40;Humana
    family and a list of script fonts&#41; and Carold Twombly &#40;Lithos and Nueva&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The Photo-Lettering Catalog is called &#34;Alphabet Thesaurus Nine Thousand&#34;  and
    is copyright 1960, published by Photo-Lettering &amp; Rheinhold Publishing. It
    breaks the works of about 120 lettering artists into 58 categories, in 18 major
    style groupings, spread over 740 pages. The only bad thing about it is that the
    type showings are not complete typefaces -- they are just lettering samples. I
    bought it from Oak Knoll Books, a great source of font treasures.

    have guessed it...  the Capital Y....  otherwise it is so beautiful with its eggformed

  body: As far as I know Lithos has no alternate Y, but I think its curves are in
    harmony with the curves of the rest of the alphabet.  I suppose the curve could
    have gone the other way and made a cup on top of the stem.  Why couldn&#39;t you
    make your own Y, and what would it look like? <BR> <BR>If there are too many Mike&#39;s
    for you, you could call me &#34;Fishboy&#34;, which is a nickname I use. &#40;I
    have always been a fish classification fanatic, and I have as many books on fish
    as I do on fonts. It&#39;s no coincidence that I picked Bowfin as part of my business&#39;
    name -- the Bowfin is the sole surviving member of an ancient, once widespread
    family of fishes &#40;Amiidae&#41; that arose in the Jurassic era. They still
    thrive in the Eastern part of the US.  Even though I moved to the West, I can
    relate to a fish like that.&#41; :-&#41;

    my imagination. You&#39;ve come very close.
