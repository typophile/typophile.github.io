  Heck, I'd love to know the block typeface too, if anyone has a clue. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Miss_4115._Bobby_1024x1024.jpg]"

  body: "Well, the script definitely a font, but I couldn't find this anywhere I looked.
    The block lettering also looks like a hand-drawn font, but I haven't looked for
    that yet. Maybe the stationer who printed this had some custom fonts made? The
    script does not look very 'professional', as a script face, but obviously they
    were going for a kind of informality in both fonts.\r\n\r\nAnyone see that script
    before?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    a lot and I know they do a lot of hand work. But it seems so unlikely! Thanks
