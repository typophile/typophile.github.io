body: "Hey, can you help me out here..?\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font that looks like
  the one in the picture. It is from the  \"Terminal\" in Mac OS X, and I know that
  it's Monaco. BUT. When you use Monaco in a normal program it is flattene  and doesn't
  look digitalized as in the picture, if you know what I mean. I would like to find
  a font that looks like this one, also in print, for use as body text, so it has
  to be thin but still looking like made out of squares.\r\n\r\nRegards, Rasmus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    What you describe is called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20anti-aliasing\">\u2018(anti-)aliasing\u2019
    </a>. In some applications (like Adobe Photoshop), you can toggle through different
    modes of smoothing. \r\n\r\nDavid: The link doesn\u2019t work (for me); seems
    it needs one more slash: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/raster-gothic/\">Raster
    Gothic</a>."

    furthermore is the difference between pixel or bitmap fonts and vector fonts (Truetype,
    Postscript)\r\n\r\nEmigre used to have those pixelfont-looking fonts (as PS1s
    of course).\r\nI know Fountain also offers a vector-PS1 version of their Sevenet-font
    (and that\u2019s even for free but also very small)."
