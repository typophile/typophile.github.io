It is going to be display size, about 40pt.

		<div class="commentbody">I should have been more specific. This is for an art piece and I'm using Helvetica because I want the copy to have a very corporate advertise-y look, something that people will definintely associate with advertising. I want the text around the copy to look like it was from a book. So it should look "familiar," again, like from a book, but not contrast to much with the copy. Right now I'm using Adobe Caslon because it seems 'neutral', or generic enough, and it's OK, but I feel it could be better and can't exactly put my finger on it. That's why I thought I'd ask the experts.

Hrant> You're probably right about lower contrast. I can not find Unica, even with a Google search.

Scott> Akkurat is nice, but I want a heavier weight then they offer, and their fonts are very expensive. Corrundum could be possibility, but maybe a bit too "slabby."</div>

You could also be ironic and use Arial Black and Times New Roman.

Helvetica is ubiquitous, it's true. But other faces like Univers strike me as being more "corporate." And I can't remember the last time I read a book set in Caslon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott> Franklin Gothic and Frutiger seem too esoteric to me. Remember this going to seen by people who are not as attuned to type. But Univers just might add that something I felt was missing. I think I was too fixated on Helvetica just because it seemed like the obvious thing to use. 

I'm not so much looking for a good sans/serif combination as a "message" done with type, although I do want them to balance well.

But I have to say, your idea of using Arial Black and Times New Roman is enticing. I don't know how ironic it would be, but it sure would be humorous.</div>

OK, do use a light weight of Helvetica then. (Shudder...)

I'm now getting the feeling that the other font should be Bookman.
http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bookman _
For one thing it has that out-of-scale atmosphere about it (I mean
it would look like a book font, magnified) plus it has low contrast.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant > I've been using Helvetica Black, but have been experimenting with Univers as per Scott's suggestion. At this point I'm liking it better, especially the Extra Black, it actually has a more "advertisey" feel. Which led to think of Helvetica Inserat, which I'm also going to try.

Bookman, that's an excellent suggestion, I would never have thought of that. I don't have it, but it's pretty cheap, and I only need one weight. Speaking of weight, it's also a little heavier which is good. I found at the size I'm using, and with the heavy copy, the regular weight looked a little thin, I was using the semibold of Adobe Caslon.</div>
