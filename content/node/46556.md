body: "I am teaching a first-year Typography class next semester. While I taught it
  last year in September, I wasn't really happy with the outcome of the projects nor
  the structure of the course and how much information I presented to the students.
  The projects/course content has been regulated (more or less) by the 'higher ups',
  but this time around, we are allowed to change some of the content and projects.
  The projects are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Typography only logo design for a new health
  food store\r\n2. Typography only logo for a publishing company\r\n3. Layout/publication
  (the students are selecting an article about a specific musician to be printed in
  a music magazine. The idea is to get the students to express the music/style of
  the artist via type w/o the use of any imagery.)\r\n4. Package design for a series
  of office products, focusing on just typography.\r\n\r\nMy challenge last year has
  been integrating the course lectures into the projects. Last year, the framework
  of the course consisted mainly of material from the typography book, mixed in with
  some of my own knowledge. Keep in mind this isn't a private art/design institution,
  but a small dept. within a state system. So there not THAT much room for flexibility.
  However, this year, we get the green light to change things around.\r\n\r\nSo in
  terms of lectures, how much should I throw at them? None of these students have
  ever taken a typography course, so this will be a new experience for them. Should
  I take out one project and increase the value of the other 3, while focusing on
  lectures? Seeing as the class is only twice a week for a measly 1hr50min, that doesn't
  give me that much time to cover history of typography in great great great detail.
  And the requirement that we HAVE to follow is at least 3 projects per semester,
  with 4 being ideal. My biggest issue is connecting projects with the lecture content.\r\n\r\nI
  am a fairly new professor (2 years of experience) and any advice from more seasoned
  designers/professors would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks Typophiles! "

    but in course planning I've found the ideas of Dee Fink to be incredibly helpful.\r\n[[http://www.ou.edu/pii/significant/integratedcoursedesign.htm|Here's
    a website with some details.]]\r\nSee the pdf linked on that page for some clear
    and explicit advice on course planning. Its emphasis is on integration, which
    sounds exactly like the issue you're wondering about.\r\nHope that helps."

    nothing important gets left out.\r\n\r\nAlso, my first-year teacher did us a huge
    favor by teaching us what the various little features of Indesign really did and
    when to use them or not use them. Student work gets a lot better when they know
    about the baseline grid and to not enable optical kerning for body copy."

    will be the one teaching the class. I have a decent knowledge of InDesign, but
    not an expert by any means. I could always expand my knowledge base, so any suggestions
    or links would be appreciated. \r\n"

  body: "At my school, we weren't allowed anywhere near a computer for the entire
    first semester of typography. All letters had to be photocopied or hand-traced,
    and the projects ranged from posters to large format books dedicated to a particular
    font. We were given short lectures on the history of type, basic terminology and
    rules, but most of the time was spent developing projects.\r\n\r\n1. Simple word
    collage (photocopier)\r\n2. Tracing an alphabet\r\n3. Designing three letters
    that could've been part of a font (tracing)\r\n4. Designing a poster (pasteup
    and tracing)\r\n5. Creating a book that would showcase a particular font (and
    it's relationship to layout, color, texture etc.)(pasteup and tracing)\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "I don\u2019t think that you should push into anything too deep with Indesign,
    just use it to reinforce your teaching. My type teacher usually showed us how
    to do whatever she was lecturing about, for example, when we learned about grids
    she showed us how the <em>Create Guides</em> tool works. I think this really helped
    drive her points home, because (for those of us who had done the reading ahead
    of time) it was the third time we had heard it, and we were getting it in a different
    context. I think that it also saved a lot of time during critiques, because people
    rarely had to point out software-related problems. "

    in typography alone that there is little time. I would surely cover what are some
    things needed for making good typography from book usage to ads and brochures.
    Touch on history of technology and valuable terms a user will need to know. Basic
    readability explaining the relationship of face, size, leading, line length. etc.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "This is more of advice as someone who loved her typography teacher, but also
    as some one who has some misgivings about her education.\r\n\r\nI do like the
    choices of projects, they are sort of similar to some of what we did in school.
    I am glad you are doing office supply packaging- we did food packaging- and I
    think it was a poor decision, because in the \"real world\" there are more rules
    for food/medical packaging.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, use the proper names for the
    different parts of characters, and whatnot. Drill the names into their heads.
    \r\n\r\nYou don't have to teach programs, but be open to answering questions about
    programs- OR even better- provide a short list of websites at the beginning of
    the semester of forums and sites with info on InDesign and Quark that they can
    use to solve problems on their own.\r\n\r\nOne last thing...we did a group magazine
    project- groups of five, and each group had a different kind of magazine. It was
    a pain, working with other people's styles, but it was fun.\r\n\r\nALSO- we had
    to research a famous typographer- I had Jan Tschichold, and then we designed a
    poster for a fake exhibition on the person, in their style, or the style of the
    time period in which they worked. It was fun.\r\n\r\nAnyway...my two cents. Best
    of luck- a teacher who cares is the best kind there is!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's
    easier to tone down a wild idea than think up a new one.\" -Alex Osborne"
