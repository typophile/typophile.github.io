body: I'm curious if anyone currently online has a healthy bit of reasoning for me.
  I'm designing a small brochure with Monotype Dante. There are quite a few dates
  included in the copy and headlines, dates that include a number of zeros. The Monotype
  Dante has a monoline zero and I'd like to replace them with o's so they don't stand
  out. (Maybe they're just bothering me?) Bringhurst's 'Elements' (second edition)
  has no ruling on the matter. Any opinions? If I'm sticking with Dante am I stuck
  with the monoline zeros? I'd appreciate hearing any thoughts.

    eyes, but they will only open slowly to beauty.\") beneath the Sabon specimen
    by Tschichold?\r\n\r\nAlso, I an curious if there is a specific name or term for
    a monoline zero, other than just that \"monoline zero.\"\r\n\r\n"

    it's called a cipher.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is the same David who
    met you this summer at the book arts program. How are you doing? I'd love to see
    your dante project when it's finished, not to mention any updates to what you
    were working on while I was there."

  body: "Terrence, glad to help, the quote is beneath the Sabon Next specimen as it
    was presented at ATypI 2002, unfortunately I don't know the author of the aphorism.\r\n\r\nDavid
    is right, \"cipher\" for a figure 0. In Turkish \"zero\" is \"s\u0131f\u0131r\",
    literally \"empty\" from the Arab word \"\xE7ifr\". In Italian \"cifra\" applies
    to every numerals or coding.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cifra_6338.gif]"
