  the HBO graphic on the top left.  Or by looking at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deadwood_titleimage.jpg
  for a little bigger picture.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "That flopped w is worth noting because the title word's characters seem designed
    to suggest printing from hand-loaded metal type on a letterpress, and I think
    it's impossible for a metal character to be loaded when it faces the wrong direction.
    (Actually, if we're meant to be looking at the metal characters as they would
    be handset and locked for inking, the rest of the letters -- thus the word itself
    -- are appearing mirrored backwards.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letterpress
