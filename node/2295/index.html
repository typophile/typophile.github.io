<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is the font used by the publisher of AD&D, TSR, for their 1st edition releases in the Dark Sun product line. I have found similar fonts, but none that match it precisely. <br> <br>I have chosen letters for the sample that are some of the most distinctive of the font as a whole. If this still is not enough for a positive ID, I can provide a whole page of scanned text. <br> <br>Good luck...I don't think you can do it. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> (Just challenging you to excellence.) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21713.jpg alt="Text Sample"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow! nice eye Randy. I knew I'd seen this before. If I'd gotten further <br>into my Old Style font notebook, I'd have reached my entry for Packard. <br> <br>Like many typefaces in the Solotype Catalog, Dieter Steffmann <br>digitized this as <a href=http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm target=_blank> Packard Antique</a>. So if you are able to use Windows <br>Truetype or Type 1, it's a freebie. Comes with a bold variant as well. <br> <br>No promise, of course, that Steffmann's version will match your <br>sample precisely. <br><br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I am impressed! I have been looking for the font off-and-on for about 5 years or more. <br> <br>I had begun to think that it was a custom font. <br> <br>I have a couple questions: First, is Opti Packard a Truetype or Type 1 font, or does it only appear in the Solotype Catalog? Second (if Opti Packard does not exist in an electronic form), do I understand you correctly that Packard Antique would be the closest electronic form of Opti Packard? <br> <br>Thank you! <br> <br>Once again...I am truly impressed. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>OptiFonts are handled these days by <a href=http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html target=_blank> Castcraft</a>. <br> <br>Their website is, to say the least, outdated and the only part that <br>functions usefully is the Designer Collections link. Since Opti <br>Packard is not in any of the four Designer Collections and the <br>Online Catalog images don't appear, you would need to contact <br>Castcraft. <br> <br>Over the last few years, I've contacted them by e-mail 5 times and <br>received a reply once. Hopefully you'll fare better. I'm sure that they <br>could provide the font in the format of your choosing. <br> <br>As to which font would be most accurate, it seems likely that the <br>OptiFont was used. Since Dieter Steffmann's version is free, you <br>can check it out for yourself. It doesn't fare the best on-screen, so <br>be sure to print a sample paragraph or two to see it on paper, <br>where it looks splendid. <br><br></div>

<div class=commentbody>There was a version called 'Paliard' that was made by NovelFonts in the mid-90's but I have been unable to find anywhere that still sells them. I found only one site that shows a sample, and it <a href=http://www.professionalinvitations.com/cfont2.htm target=_blank>looks identical</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great info Mike and Mike. <br> <br>$57.50 per font, did I read that correctly? <br> <br>Does OPTI have a connection to URW? <br> <br>I'd love to see a Foundry Flow Chart to see where <br>all these obscure type companies came from. <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the info. <br> <br>Now...I opened up Steffmann's Packard Antique font with High-Logic's Font Creator Program and I noticed that there were several errors/warnings. I fixed (very meticulously, mind you) the errors and warnings, which included contour directions, redundant points, overlapping contours, and a few obvious defects. I saved my fixed font as a new font file (Truetype). <br> <br>What is the best way to handle this in terms of releasing this "fixed" version out into the "wild" of the Internet. Of course, I would give Steffmann full credit still, but I would make a note within the font that it was a cleaned up version of the font. Should I name my fixed font differently? Should I even be doing this? <br> <br>I was hoping that my cleanup work would make the font appear better on screen, but unfortunately, my changes had no effect in this regard. You are right however, that the font looks excellent when printed out.</div>

<div class=commentbody>My advice would be to contact Dieter Steffmann before you do anything to distribute this (if you just use it yourself that's up to you). For one thing, Dieter may want to know what changes were made; for another your software may 'fix' it only so that your software doesn't see errors/warnings -- are you sure that makes it compatible with any other similar software, like FontLab or Fontographer? <br> <br>Anyway, talk to Dieter, is my advice.</div>
