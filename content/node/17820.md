body: "Does anyone know a nice sans serif to go with Geometric slabserif 712?\r\nI'm
  using Geometric for the bodytext of my book and I want my headers to be sans serif.
  \r\nPreferably a font thats also great for bodytext so I can switch. I was using
  Akzidenz but I dont like the way that font looks as body text at all. I like DIN
  but its soooo overused! Any suggestions? Thanks!"
