  body: It&#39;s probably called &#34;design&#34;. It&#39;s &#34;Mix&#34;ed, semi-random
    logic that somehow fits together. Why not ask Luc, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got a
    better idea than most as to the logic of it.

  body: Also interesting would be to unravel the logic behind the semi-serifs in Rotis
    - since according to Aicher&#39;s &#34;Typographie&#34; logic was indeed used.
