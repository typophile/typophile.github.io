  body: "I recognize the image from the Phil's Photo book, but I do not know of this
    font in digital form. The closest I have seen to this look was in the Expresiv
    Photo Lettering Font Collection where there was a Benguiat Charisma Shaded, but
    it was not a connecting script. I've never seen any shaded script with alternates
    like this for the start, middle and end of words. Seems to be crying out to be
    an OpenType font, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    sure...\r\n\r\nMaybe you have some suggestions for an 'unshaded' script that has
    a similar feel?"
