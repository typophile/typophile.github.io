  were the same typeface.)  \r\n\r\nI'd chalk it up as one of the hundreds of Gothic
  No.-- faces that emerged and then disappeared, except that there are two different
  nicks throughout the font.  If different people were casting it, maybe it's something
  known... Anyway.  Have a look??\r\n\r\nhttp://www.inside.mica.edu/printmaking/temp/sansserif72.jpg"

    mean by 'nicks'. I also wish there were a cap R in the sample - that's one of
    the characters I really use to identify sans serifs.\r\n\r\nAlternate Gothic SB
    One is the closest I've found, but not exact.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/alternate-gothic-sb/"

  body: "Here's the problem when one tries to identify metal fonts, is that we don't
    get a full showing and have to guess at a point.\r\n\r\nYour sample looks very
    close to \"Alternate Gothic 1\" <a href=\"http://www.donblack.ca/fonts/gothic.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Trade Gothic Bold Extra Condensed</a>, based on the unique spur
    on the uppercase \"G\". \r\n\r\nAlso, since we are looking at metal faces, there
    will be design differences between point sizes (scaling). So I believe Patricia
    is correct in identifying a digital version of Alternate Gothic #1.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gothic-b.gif]"

    body: "Yeah, there weren't any cap Rs in the font he gave me - I don't know what
      happened to them, since there were a decent number of all the other characters.\r\nI
      looked on Don's site but couldn't tell from his graphics if the G matched up.
      \ You think it does?"

  body: "I've been hunting through the McGrew book on American Metal Typefaces and
    the A.T.A. Type Comparison Book. I got pretty excited for a minute about Monotype
    New Gothic Condensed, because it had the large hook on the J and the right K (both
    features were unlike Alternate Gothic). It even had the spur 'beard' on the G,
    but the G is too closed, and the Q has the wrong tail. The $ was pretty  close,
    but the numerals were not shaped the same. Sigh!\r\n\r\nI think your comment about
    the hundreds of numbered Gothics is the true key to why we are having so little
    luck. It seems every foundry has a variety of weights and widths of Gothics, and
    without knowing the Foundry or the age of the type, we can only hope to get lucky.\r\n\r\n(Side
    question: Norbert, how did you manage to include a graphic in your post? I didn't
    think that was possible. I've been waiting for that capability to come back.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I figured as much.  All I have to go on is that it's 72 point, with a centered
    foot groove.  One of the nicks [marks created by the casting machine on the body
    of the type - they show you which way is up, and also often help identify who
    cast the type] is one I've never seen before - a triangular-shaped groove instead
    of a rounded one.\r\n\r\nIt came from a shop in MA, but that doesn't necessarily
    mean anything.\r\n\r\nI'm getting McGrew for myself for Christmas :)"
