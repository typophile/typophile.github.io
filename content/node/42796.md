  felt sorry i can't read Spanish, \r\nthe content looks really interesting\r\n(yes,
  I am just looking at pretty pictures)\r\n\r\nI know and love most of the usual suspects\r\nof
  english typography blogs, but except maybe\r\nI Love Typography, they are all mostly
  a\r\ntypography and design showcase, and deal less in\r\nthe type design prcoess.\r\n\r\nSo
  does anyone know any good type blogs?\r\n\r\nthnx\r\n-Y"
