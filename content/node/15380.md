  is actually Trade Gothic, and it honestly looks that way if you compare the two.
  This <a href=\"http://www.fontinfo.net/Font_Analog.html\">list of Bitstream font
  aliases</a> actually lists several \"real names\" inluding Lightline Gothic.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nI
  was recently looking through a 1995 CA Design Annual and came across a Potlatch
  piece called \"Vintage Type\" designed by Kit Hinrichs (Pentagram). The spread showed
  an old ATF book with a digital News Gothic -- Bitstream News Gothic. I know Mr.
  Hinrichs has <a href=\"http://daidala.com/25feb2003.html\">used this</a> <a href=\"http://www.pentagram.com/portfolio-editorial-14.htm\">type
  before</a>, so is it possible that he simply doesn't know any better? Or is it possible
  that Bitstream's version is based on a smaller size since it's not as narrow as
  other News Gothics? I think it's really curious..."
