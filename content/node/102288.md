  and Japanese typography, underlining elements in contrast and in common. \r\n\r\nThere
  is a huge bibliography about Latin typography but it is hard for me to find exhaustive
  information about the Japanese typography, in terms of concepts as kerning, line
  length, or layout, hierarchy, etc.\r\n\r\nI hope it is clear what I am trying to
  say.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help\r\n\r\nG"
