  [[http://typophile.com/cms/node/31959 | here]] in the type identification forum.
  \ The general consensus reached was that the lettering was hand lettered, though
  a couple of faces (including one of mine) were suggested as the basis of approximating
  the 'look and feel' of the lettering.\r\n\r\nThis is the specimen that was posted
  in 2007:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Svengalis_3729_3937.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
  is my progress to date at trying to recreate it as a font.  So far I've worked on
  the lower case, or 'small capitals':\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Svengali_5482.png]\r\n\r\nI'd
  be pleased to hear suggestions and feedback on this project so far,\r\n\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n"

  body: This is awesome! The <em>R</em> is fantastic. I'd love to see the tail of
    the <em>R</em> reach just <em>a little</em> past the baseline (subtly - only the
    way a bowl would overshoot). Right now it just feels a touch higher than it should
    be, like it's trying to balance on the stem. Regardless, I think it's the best
    of the bunch. Other favorites are the <em>U</em>, <em>J</em>, and <em>K</em>.
    Looking forward to the release.

    I'm DELIGHTED to see your work in progress. Please consider me the first in line
    \  to license a copy, okay? Meanwhile, if you need any testing or user commentary,
    I'd be thrilled to help.\r\n\r\nBest wishes!"

    I hope you're aware that's the gutter of the page curling back.\r\n\r\nw: Would
    look more at home if narrower.\r\n\r\nf: I'm not convinced the original form needed
    to be corrected. Alternates, perhaps."

  body: "Cerulian,\r\n\r\nYou make some good points:\r\n\r\n- Especially good point
    about the capital H!\r\n  \r\n- Interesting too, I hadn't realised I'd done that
    to the 'f'...I think it's almost a subonscious habit of mine when designing E's
    and F's to referse the lengths of the hozizontals.\r\n- I've narrowed the 'w'
    a little.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I've now had a stab at the full range of capitals,
    an here's the next test piece:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test
