  Kashmiri. A couple of years ago, I edited Scheherazade, named it as Narqalam, and
  used it on my web site kashmirilanguage.com. 3 characted, not having unicode, where
  made by substitution.\r\nKashmiri, a small minority language, needs a good Nastaleeq
  font. I am trying to update Paktype Nastaleeq (perhaps open license, or could be
  referred to owners when complete). I need help with adding the required character
  from someone experienced in the field. Please help in this purely education, non-profit
  effort."
