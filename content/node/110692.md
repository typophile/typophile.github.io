  body: "Hi Bob, it is pretty close:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KozukaMinchoProExtraLight_6342.jpg]\r\nand
    could be substituted without most people really noticing the differences, e.g.
    the ear on the g, letter widths etc. Noting the very narrow m and w in the unknown
    I wonder if it's monospace?\r\nBTW huge font size -- too big for Fontlab to save
    it as a file without deleting thousands of glyphs. Don't know how well it would
    work in plain word processors.\r\nDon"

  body: Don mentioned huge font size which is true for all Asian fonts - but  Fontlab
    Studio 5 can save it without deleting and Fontographer 5 will also save the file
    so it should work fine with most word processors.

  body: "bojev: To me it looks like Adobe more or less generated a Latin counterpart
    to Kozua Mincho using Adobe Serif MM. On the other hand, I get the impression
    that many Latin counterparts to Japanese typefaces are designed in a similar style.
    Especially those who are designed in Japan. A kind of middle-of-the-road Century
    Old Style design with a large x-height and a weight that is too light. The weight
    and proportions of such typefaces may be a good-enough-match to Japanese Mincho,
    but they are often too light to serve as a decent text typeface for readers of
    the Latin script. \r\n\r\nTGabriel: The typeface in the sample you posted looks
    as if someone tried to create a monospaced version of Times Roman. Smells like
    \u2018default design\u2019."

  body: "Very helpful Albert. So lets look for a version of Times Roman that fits
    the letter-forms better than the usual suspects. There is a matching g in the
    version designed by Francesco Simoncini and W. Bilz in 1965, for Ludwig & Mayer
    and now sold in digital form by Bitstream as Life. So lets try a compressed version
    of Life [80%]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LifeCondensed_6351.jpg]\r\nPart
    way there. Closer than Kozuka Mincho Extra Light.\r\nCan see how selective widening
    of some glyphs, such as j, and narrowing of others, such as m and w, while keeping
    the weight could make a monospace.\r\nDon"
