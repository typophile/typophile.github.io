body: "I'm an admirer of Vladimir Nabokov's novels - everyone interested in good literature
  should read his books. Let me point you to the design project, by Chip Kidd, of
  Nabokov's posthumous \"The Original of Laura\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/books/s_656078.html\r\n\r\n\"Instead
  of typed or handwritten pages, Vladimir Nabokov left behind 138 3-inch by 5-inch
  index cards that his son took painstaking measures to organize and arrange to create
  \"The Original of Laura.\" Each index card is replicated exactly, with words crossed
  out, underlined or erased, and Nabokov's notations, and printed on stock that is
  similar to note cards.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card-a_3742.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  another interesting Nabokov book cover treatment:\r\n\r\nhttp://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11597"

  body: Ivan's description is fitting, as Nabokov was an entomologist as well as a
    celebrated writer.
