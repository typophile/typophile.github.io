body: "Hi,\r\nIm working on a project, and the artwork for the movie \"It Might Get
  Loud\", and I am missing some font files. They use the font \"BEHelvetica-Bold\".
  It is different from the regular Helvetica. I can not find this font when I google
  it. I have the regular weight of the font but not bold that I am looking for. In
  the propertys of the fonts It says \"Copyright 1990 The FONT Company ALL Rights
  Reserved\".\r\n\r\nAnyone know where I can get this font? Or a similar font.\r\n\r\nYou
  can see the font here: http://www.impawards.com/2009/it_might_get_loud_xlg.html\r\n(In
  the taglines, cast and director credits, in grey.)\r\n\r\nThanks! :) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BEHelvetica-Bold_5196.jpg]"
