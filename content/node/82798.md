body: "Hello. I've been a longtime lurker. This is my first post.\r\n\r\nI'm designing
  a type-based mural and am looking for a Devanagari display font to use in creating
  digital mockups. The font should be contemporary with a heavy, sign-painted look,
  but without large differences between the thicks and thins (see sample below). This
  Devanagari font will be paired with a hand-lettered slab serif I'm working on. \r\n\r\nRecommendations
  of foundries with emphasis on Devanagari fonts would be tremendously helpful. \r\n\r\nI'm
  surprised how difficult this has been to find, but I may be limited by only being
  able to search in English. I've found mostly free fonts of questionable quality
  or fonts that mimic Devanagari with stylized roman characters (bah!).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n.Mike\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hindi_graffiti_by_EmilyDanger-crop_4998.jpg](photo

    somehow. Joe Pemberton's blog has an entry titled, [[http://typophile.com/node/61686|\u201CIndian
    Type Foundry (ITF) Launches\u201D]], referencing the launch of [[http://www.indiantypefoundry.com|Indian
    Type Foundry]].\r\n\r\nAbout halfway down in the comments, Dan Reynolds gives
    a very helpful rundown of the state of Indic scripts. \r\n\r\nKohinoor Devanagari
    may work for me, but I'd still like to find a few more brushier options. Any suggestions
    are still welcome. If I find others, I'll post them here."

    to google of yesteryear/s). Search for 'Hindi Devanagari Fonts' or 'Unicode Devanagari
    Fonts'.\r\nI have designed a text font with Latin and Nagari glyphs; but no heavy
    or black type.\r\n"
