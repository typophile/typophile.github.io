body: "There is no 'official' typeface for the words California Republic on the official
  state flag. Shocking. I am trying however, to find out what the most often used
  typeface is, when they print the flag. I've done a lot of research, and this is
  the closest example to what was spelled out in a 1953 bill. Any help locating this
  typeface, or one very close, would be appreciated. It's a block sans, but check
  out the R's leg terminal. That's the tricky part. \r\n"
