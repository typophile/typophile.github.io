    \r\n\r\nTheir choice of Sans is really odd, there are easily two or three better
    matches for Catull, especially for the subset of 5 characters they are actually
    using. The height of new addition is also strange and it starts to visually dwarf
    the Google part."

  body: "I feel like the simple sans type makes the Google logo lose its charm and
    look like an entry at cheapassedlogocontests.com. Trying to pair clean and simple
    with a Photochopped logo seems kind of absurd. I really just don\u2019t know where
    Google is going with its brand. Didn\u2019t they hire H&FJ to do a new sans that
    only shows up in some all-text magazine ads?"

    easy and incorrect to label Google's visual identity as amateur. Their look is
    not about being polished or simple. "

    been about being simple, stemming from their focus on simplicity of the user experience.
    Though whether it is/was polished is a matter of opinion."

    on two lines :( I don't think the two fonts complement each other very well.

    and \"amateur\" look. They say \"don't be evil\", so they marketing team is probably
    aiming for \"don't look evil\" :P\r\n\r\nGreat identity in my opinion."
