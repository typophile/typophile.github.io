  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The <em>Dutch Type Library</em> and <em>URW++ Design & Development</em> proudly present <strong>DTL OTMaster</strong> (OTM), a highly sophisticated application for reviewing, editing and saving tables of fonts with a snft file structure, as there are CFF and TTF flavored <strong>OpenType</strong> fonts, <strong>TrueType</strong> fonts and <strong>TrueType Collection</strong> fonts.

Font editors, like for instance the <strong>DTL FontMaster</strong> suite, <strong>FontLab Studio</strong> and <strong>FontForge</strong>, rely on their own internal data formats for type design and font production. From these data, binary fonts for the end-user are compiled as the last step in the font production process.
<strong>OTM</strong> is a tool for inspecting and adjusting such binary fonts, irrespective of the font editor used for their creation.

<strong>OTM</strong> makes the editing of tables possible from a <strong>graphical user interface</strong>. It comes with built-in tools like the <em>Glyph Editor</em> for proofing and editing contours or even drawing glyphs from scratch. A &lsquo;kern&rsquo; Table Viewer is available for proofing and refining the kerning, and a &lsquo;GSUB&rsquo;/&lsquo;GPOS&rsquo; Viewer to visually test (and in case of GPOS also adjust) these OpenType Layout tables.

<strong>DTL OTMaster</strong> was programmed in Hamburg, Germany at <em>URW++ Design & Development</em>, renowned for pioneering in the field of font technology development for more than thirty years. The <strong>FM Team</strong> (Dr. Juergen Willrodt, Axel Stoltenberg, Hartmut Schwarz, Peter Rosenfeld and Frank E. Blokland) was joined by Karsten Luecke as advisor and also author of the extensive and detailed <em>OTM manual</em> and Nikola Djurek for the design of the function icons.

<strong>OTM</strong> is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Free <strong>Light versions</strong> are available for: <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_MAC.zip"><strong>Mac OS X</strong> (download)</a>, <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_WIN.zip"><strong>Windows</strong> (download)</a> and <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Light_1.0.0_LIN.tgz"><strong>Linux</strong> (download)</a>. 

The downloads also contain the <em>OTM manual</em> in PDF format.

Thanks for the compliment. This is another one (especially Dr. Juergen Willrodt deserves the credits here) by Dr. Ken Lunde, Sr. Computer Scientist at Adobe, on Thomas Phinney's blog (http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/01/dtl-otmaster/):
'As someone who works with OpenType fonts on an every-day basis, and with the tools that are used to build and check them, I would like to state here that DTL OTMaster is a fabulous tool. The best way for me to characterize it is that it gives me the power of AFDKO’s “spot” tool, and that of TTX, but wrapped up in nice GUI. It handles CJK fonts well, including those with a large number of glyphs. I especially appreciate that there is a Mac OS X version, because that is the OS that I use.'

AzizMostafa: ‘Please allow 2 weeks to explore it.’

OTM supports mark positioning lookups and can display them. These mark to base, mark to mark and mark to ligature positions are editable in OTM. They are also supported when a features file is imported. Since OTM is based on the latest version of the Adobe SDK it supports the GPOS mark features and one can create a GPOS table from the features file. 

I wrote: 'The downloads also contain the OTM manual in PDF format.' and I would like to add here that version 1.5 of the OpenType specs is attached and linked to the manual, thanks to the permission granted by Microsoft.</div>

I have downloaded

The archive contains two files: 
OTM_Light_1.0
OTM_Light_1.0_Intel_Leopard

There is no PDF file included. 

Also, when I open OTM_Light_1.0 (since I'm not running Leopard), an application called Automator opens, and that's it. No indication what should happen afterwards. Can you advise?

Thanks for notifying me. Although I could not reproduce the error, I have built new VISE X installers which you can download from:

Hopefully the installer for OS 10.4 (and previous versions) functions well on your machine. Please let me know the outcome.</div>

New in DTL OTmaster (Light) version 1.0.1:
- Support for the very latest edition of the AFDKO 2.5.
- Changed export of the GDEF table.
- Bug fix for crash during export of OpenType Layout features files and Character Layout files under Mac OS 10.4.x and 10.3.x.

Very occasionally a problem was reported concerning the VISE installers for the Mac. New VISE X installers have been generated to solve this.</div>

&nbsp;
<strong>A new version (2.0.0) of DTL OTMaster is available now.</strong>
&nbsp;
The functionality of DTL OTMaster has been enhanced considerably in the new 2.0.0 version. For instance the <em>Glyph Editor</em> now supports the option to import and export EPS and SVG data. It is also possible to cut, copy and paste glyph data between CFF and TTF fonts. Imported glyphs can be autohinted.
&nbsp;
The OpenType Layout features processing is based on latest build of the AFDKO 2.5 version and the OpenType specification 1.6 is supported. The <em>Concistency Checker</em> has been enhanced with new ‘Version’ and ‘Statistics’ options.
&nbsp;
Especially because of the new glyph editing functionality and the option to add EPS and SVG data to OpenType (CFF and TTF) fonts, DTL OTMaster 2.0.0 is not only suitable for professional font producers, but also for graphic designers who want to add special characters and logo’s to existing fonts (if the end user license that came with the font in question permits this, of course).
&nbsp;

Yes, that is correct... or actually it is not. We fixed this in the full edition some time ago (and now we will do this in the Light version too). Yoshua is right about the <em>Read Me</em> file, this should confirm that what you have downloaded is actually version 2.0. Sorry for this.

Basically this depends on how much one appreciates the checking functions OTM <em>Light</em> offers (see also: http://typophile.com/node/67288) and options like for instance the export of features files. It is the only tool of its kind, which offers a GUI anyway, and I reckon that there are quite some OTM <em>Light</em> versions in use in combination with other font tools.

And labelled either ‘Demo’ or ‘Light’, it is for free, isn’t it?

		<div class="commentbody">Svenni, look at it this way: the light version of OTM is a diagnostic tool, the full version lets you do surgery. I value having the full version because I sometimes need to perform post-production operations on font data, because in my workflow a TTF or OTF becomes the source format for OTL and hinting work. But if one has a workflow in which a program like FontLab remains the source format throughout, up to the point of final font generation, then OTM is useful as a means of examining generated fonts, quality assurance, etc. and you only need the light version.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, I consider OTMaster Light a very powerful "in-depth font viewer". For example, its Tools/'GPOS'/'GSUB' Table Viewer is a quite powerful and useful tool to examine the functionality of the compiled OpenType Layout tables. 

TypeSupply FeatureProof [1] offers a similar functionality, but OTMaster is much more robust with more complicated fonts (e.g. complex-script fonts for Indic languages, which FeatureProof simply does not open at all). Also, OTMaster works on both Mac OS X and Windows, while FeatureProof is Mac-only. On the other hand, FeatureProof offers a more practical interface for testing contextual OpenType Layout features in a "real text string". 

And yes, indeed, the full version of OTMaster allows you to edit pretty much any aspect of the low-level structures of a TrueType or OpenType font. TTX/FontTools [2] allows pretty much the same, but in a rather different manner: OTMaster offers a graphical user interface while TTX/FontTools allows the user to convert an entire TTF or OTF font (or one selected table) into XML, edit the XML in a text editor, and convert it back into a font. Also, installing and setting up TTX/FontTools can be challenging for some users, while OTMaster works "out of the box". 

Both working manners have their advantages. If you need to make more changes, the XML workflow (through TTX/FontTools) can be more efficient, but for a simple fix or two in a font, OTMaster is the better solution. 

I definitely think DTL OTMaster is an excellent product.

<cite>Also, installing and setting up TTX/FontTools can be challenging for some users, while OTMaster works "out of the box".</cite>

Mainly because the installation instructions are out of date and incomplete and mainly because some developers seem to develop for themselves only: http://typophile.com/node/67406

I mean, it is wasted time, if each of some users has to solve the same problems instead of having no problems because of updated instructions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Arno, 

please consider that opensource efforts such as TTX/FontTools are made by volunteers in their spare time. The concept of opensource is that any developer can, and is encouraged, to contribute. The software comes free of charge, as is. There is nobody who collects license fees, and there is nobody who gets paid for their work on the software. 

When I produced the build instructions for TTX/FontTools for Windows five or so years ago, I worked on Windows. More than two years ago, I completely switched to Mac OS X, and can no longer maintain build instructions for Windows. 

Anyone willing to contribute updated build instructions for TTX/FontTools for Windows is welcome to do so (or is welcome to find a Python for Windows developer who is willing to do it, and pay him). This is the key concept of opensource. 

Milton Friedman used to say "There is no such thing as a free lunch". If the lunch is said to be free, it may mean that you need to participate in cooking it.

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>New: DTL OTMaster 2.4</strong>
&nbsp;
A new version of OTM has become available. The new functionality comprises improved export of OpenType layout features, a couple of enhancements in the <em>OTF Consistency Checker</em> and the options to change the table version numbers in the &lsquo;post&rsquo; and &lsquo;gasp&rsquo; headers.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_240_1_3669.jpg]
DTL OTMaster can be used to export OpenType layout tables present in a font. The exported OpenType layout features &#xFB01;les can be read-in directly without any alterations. And although the way the exported features are listed could be different (due to the inevitable interpretation of the binary tables) from the features-description that was used for generating the font originally, the functionality should be completely identical. 
&nbsp;
OTM 2.4 supports the latest AFDKO 2.5 build and can be used to update the OpenType layout features in a font. Any OpenType layout features &#xFB01;le with the AFDKO syntax can be imported, even if the listed features are not covered by the font&rsquo;s character set. The modi&#xFB01;ed Hatch OpenType (&lsquo;HOT&rsquo;) tool will remove the none-covered features during font generation. Of course, to make all applicable features work, the character naming convention should be identical in both the font and the OpenType layout features &#xFB01;le.
&nbsp;
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_240_2_3725.jpg]
The <em>OTF Consistency Checker</em> in OTM 2.4 contains a new, extensive, &lsquo;Language&rsquo; section, which can be used to list and print the (missing) glyphs that a font supports for a speci&#xFB01;c language.

		<div class="commentbody">I can also attest that the AFDKO functionality of DTL OTMaster 2.4 is great. 

1. The export of AFDKO feature definition files from existing OpenType fonts has been improved so now OTMaster can export the code in such a way that AFDKO 2.5-compatible compilers such as MakeOTF, Fontographer 5 or the upcoming FontLab Studio 5.1 can easily compile it, problem-free. 

2. The intelligent subsetting of the AFDKO code works very well. If your glyph naming is consistent, you can use one large AFDKO file that covers the largest possible glyph set. You can import it into any font that uses the same glyph names, and OTMaster will only add the feature definitions that are covered by the glyph set. 

An example on how this can be used: 

Open a large multi-script OpenType font in OTMaster, export the AFDKO code, open the same OpenType font in a font editor such as Fontographer or FontLab Studio or even TypeTool, remove some glyphs, generate the font, open it in OTMaster and import the previously exported AFDKO code. The rules or lookups that no longer apply to the font (because the relevant glyphs are no longer present) will be transparently ignored, and only features that are covered will be included. 

In fact, you can then export the AFDKO file again from that font, and then you'll get the subsetted AFDKO file. So rather than removing lines of code by hand, editing your classes etc., you just use OTMaster as a "filter" that will process your code. You can then, perhaps, make some small changes to that new, subsetted AFDKO file, and take it into any tool such as FontLab Studio, Fontographer or MakeOTF. 

Of course this means that you can have a large "master" AFDKO feature definition file, and use OTMaster to add the code to any font you're making, regardless of the actual glyph set. You can either import the AFDKO file in OTMaster and then save the new OpenType font (with features included) right from OTMaster, or -- if you want ultimate control -- import the master AFDKO file into the font in OTMaster and then export it again: then you'll get the custom-tailored AFDKO file, and you can perform some additional manual edits (e.g. if you have some special "calt" or "ssXX" features which are not present in your master file). 

This is, potentially, a huge time-saver for people making OpenType fonts. 

Last year, I've started using OTMaster as the final step of font production, after generating the font from Fontographer or FontLab Studio. OTMaster gives you a low-level OpenType-spec-native view at the font, quite like FontTools/TTX, but wrapped in a quite clean user interface. 

OTMaster is a great "illustrator" for the OpenType spec. If you want to take the step of reading through the OpenType spec at some point (which I do recommend if you are developing fonts), reading the spec is much more pleasant if you open a font in OTMaster and view the actual tables organization and values. This will help you understand the spec much better. I hope for many of you, if you do this, it'll allow your brain to make "click" at some point, and you'll quite likely be able to finally "get" the inside structure of OpenType font. IMO, that's tremendously helpful. 

The trial version of version 2.4 is not available. OTMaster Light 2.0 is the latest trial version available. As a trial, it works quite well. You can familiarize yourself with the tool and see whether it's any good for you, in general. Also, there's a small video that I've created showing DTL OTMaster in action. The video is based on OTMaster 2.3, so some of the new features are not shown. 

DTL OTMaster 2.4 will be available shortly at

At 11.50 hrs. Adam will give a talk titled <em>OpenType Mastering</em>. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the synopsis: 
&nbsp;
‘<em>Fontographer is a bit like the guitar or piano of a type designer &ndash; it focuses on the creative aspects of making fonts. FontLab Studio offers creative tools and a fair bit of engineering gear. But DTL OTMaster is a true font engineering tool that allows you to control the final quality of your digital font files.

		<div class="commentbody">Currently the production of a new edition of DTL OTMaster is ﬁnalized. OTM 3 will be presented at the ATypI Amsterdam conference October 2013. A number of new functions will become available:

1. Export IK/II/BE/IB
2. Export All (IK/II/BE/IB, UFM, CHA, FEA)
3. Import/Export IVS
4. Improvements for the Glyph Editor:
– Background display: Match Unicode
– Many new editing options
5. Switch for Subroutinization in CFF
6. Support OS/2 Table V… (a secret still ;-)
7. Side-by-Side Viewer (multiple Fonts)
8. Change table view with ( + )
9. Edit Feature Parameters
10. Consistency Checker:
– Check Names has been modiﬁed

Besides the full version, there will be a new <em>Light</em> edition (for €49.50), from which the import/export functionality (including the OpenType Layout features subsetting) and glyph-editing functionality is removed.

The spec is available from MS now, and it would be great to have a tool to view and edit these tables. A colour picker for the CPAL table would be really nice, but even just editable RGBA values would be welcome.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello John,

Karsten, who is currently working on the manual, also came up with this question. I followed the discussion on the OT-list, and will talk about the support for the new COLR and CPAL tables with Juergen. Hopefully he, Axel and Hartmut will ﬁnd some time to do this before ATypI Amsterdam.

Karsten already did a wonderful job when he wrote the former <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_Manual_230.pdf">OTM manual</a>. The concise <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/OTM_240_Addendum.pdf">addendum</a> for version 2.4 was made by me.

Every now and then innovations in font design didn't percolate into actual design software because there were no <em>fonts</em> to use them with, and there were no fonts because the <em>software</em> wasn't there. And the software wasn't there because there was no demand from the design software writers ...

It's fantastic that OTM so quickly integrated this, as did <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/105216">FontCreator</a> and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/105212">Type Light</a>! Now it's up to the higher echelons of software vendors to implement proper support, first for viewing, then for printing.</div>
