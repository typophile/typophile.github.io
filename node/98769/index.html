  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">(Following up from <a href="http://typophile.com/node/98710">this thread in Design</a>.)

Having read that it's a useful learning exercise for a starting designer to try digitizing a historical (metal) type, I decided to try this with Bruce Rogers's Centaur.  I've never seen a digital version that looks remotely close to the beautiful text of books typeset in metal Centaur – they're all come out too fine and spindly, and look oddly sterile somehow.  I'm clearly <a href="http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=12">not the only one to think so</a>.

I recently acquired a copy of "The Centaur Types", which is set in 16-point metal-type Centaur.  Using that as a guide, I began trying to something that captures the spirit of the text within its pages.  (I actually adapted my initial outlines from scans out of Meggs & Carter's “Typographic Specimens: The Great Typefaces”, supplemented by some unfortunately rather poor-quality images from an old 20th-century Monotype catalogue that I found on-line.  I then used the Rogers text as a guide for redrawing the outlines to the desired weight.)

I had to essentially invent a number of characters since the metal type (so far as I know) never included them.  I tried to be consistent with the style of metal Centaur, and that of other humanist types of similar origin.

For the time being, I've given my new Centaur revival the working name "Mythology".  Compared to other digital Centaurs, Mythology is both more substantial and less mechanically crisp in form.  It also has looser spacing.

This is my first attempt at a direct revival.  I'd be interested to know what others think, not just of the results but of the methods used to reach this point.  As well as more general critique, of course.  :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looks pretty great. A white star ornament doesn't serve as an asterisk, though. If you can't find a source to confirm what Monotype et al have done and want to make yours different, an asterisk of appropriate character might be made by pinwheeling the comma or a shape like the top of the exclamation point.</div>

Would a solid black star be better?  I've seen some 15th-century revivals do that (Bembo comes to mind).

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, in point of fact the 'shuriken' asterisk in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/93634#comment-529784">this post</a> was originally designed for Mythology.  I ended up deciding it worked better in Suzuran, though — and so I changed Mythology to use the star, which I thought looked rather interesting.

On a different note, I'm wondering if it'd be worth trying to do a 'handtooled' version of this font...

		<div class="commentbody">No knowledge, but you might be interested in [[http://benwhitmore.altervista.org/coelacanth-type-family/|this]], an open source digitisation with optical sizes, in alpha. Be warned: it's rough, especially the italic!

If you're planning to use it you'll want to disable the ligatures in italic, since the ligatures in place there are roman ones, and personally I think the heavy weight feels more for interpolation than as designs I'd consider using. But the basics are there, and having optical styles makes this an interesting project. I don't believe any digitisation of it has optical sizes, open source or not. [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/centaur/|Here]] and [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/|here]] are less idealistic but more practical releases.</div>

I'm hoping to do a similar treatment for Arrighi eventually. I probably won't have much chance to get back to either one before this summer, though (once my thesis defense is finished, hah). :)</div>
