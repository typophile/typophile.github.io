  body: "Looks alright to me. It's spaced wide, but the spacing seems fairly even.
    Then again, I've never done any work in Verlag.\r\n\r\nMaybe the D could stand
    to be closer to the E, but that might be pushing it. \r\n\r\nThe spacing between
    the A and the S is naturally tighter. You might try playing with that a bit. But
    really, it looks fine as it is. "

  body: Thanks Palatine. Verlag is pretty forgiving. I might just be being too picky!
