  body: It's okay. The "modern" leaf motif (your colored bit) is a bit overused by
    now though. And it kind of reads like a block with a spot of color in the upper
    right corner. I think more height differentiation between the letters (a real
    upper and lower case) would help it to scan better but you are probably constrained
    by your type. Because you didn't elaborate on what this design is for, I can't
    speak to how effective it is to the target audience. Hope this helps.

  body: "I think having an uppercase \"A\" and \"E\" would definitely help you getting
    a more balanced negative space but I have no idea how an uppercase \"T\" would
    look like. \r\n\r\nRight now I would really like to see \"t's\" arm beeing on
    the same vertical position as the one of \"f\". Maybe verticaly flip it and you
    would have a geometrical shape formed by the two initial letters. Allthough I'm
    not sure this is desired -- but at least it would be possible.\r\n\r\nI agree
    on bemerx25 that this kind of style is a bit overused but I think you've done
    a nice job on designing the type and that it has got something special to it."
