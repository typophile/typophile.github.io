body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI have developed a font that works in every Uniscribe application
  (and even some non-Uniscribe applications) that I've tried *except* for Microsoft
  Word. Even WordPad works. The font shows up in the font list (even with a correct
  preview) but Word does not let me switch to or type in that font. So, e.g., selecting
  all (ctrl-a) and choosing the new font does nothing.\r\n\r\nHave any of you run
  into this sort of thing before? What could the cause possibly be? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
