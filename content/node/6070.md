    if things are like they say, the Greek Gill Sans mentioned was designed by a colleague
    of Panos, Hector Haramboulos. <BR> <BR>And it would be pretty unfair to merely
    consider Cannibal &#34;an Athen-based agency&#34;. They did many good and some
    excellent Greek interpretations of many Monotype, FontFont and Emigre fonts, and
    they are the leading Greek label, I think. Although I&#39;m not so enthusiastic
    by Haramboulos&#39; Gill Hellenic &#40;I have a copy sent me by Panos and I have
    the Monotype version I bought as well&#41;, the design already existed. If there
    was someone to choose &#40;in Greece&#41; for the task, it could not have been
    none other than Cannibal, I suspect. <BR> <BR>If you wish to see better and subtler
    work by Cannibal, you may look at the great Greek version of Fedra &#40;developed
    by Panos Haratzopoulos with Peter Bilak&#41; or to the classic but unusual Apollonia,

    here on Typophile. Then Yves, Hrant, and Thomas pointed me toward his Autobiography,
    where he confesses his deeds. Aside from having it out of the horse&#39;s mouth,
    or hands, so to speak. If people like Erik Spiekermann believe it &#40;he posted
    a explanation last month on Speak Up&#41;, it is probably true. <BR> <BR>Again,
    I never said that people shouldn&#39;t use his types. Perpetua is my favorite

  body: 'Let me answer some of your questions regarding the Olympic font. <BR> <BR>First
    of all, the Olympic font -Gill Sans Hellenic- was designed by my colleague in
    Cannibal, Hector Haralambous and I thank Claudio for mentioning it. &#40;Hector
    among other things, has been designing fonts for more than 20 years&#41;  <BR>Some
    modifications that I did, do not remove any credit from Hector. <BR>This Greek
    version of Gill Sans is quite different than Gill Sans Dual Greek and is distributed
    under license of Agfa Monotype by Cannibal which is the name of our design studio.
    <BR>The reason why Athens 2004 used Gill Sans Hellenic is clearly quoted in Agfa
    Monotype&#39;s announcement. <BR>Now, if Eric Gill was a paidophile and a pervert
    is something irrelevant with this conversation and I agree with what Dan posted.
    <BR> <BR>RED Design Consultants, together with Wolff Olins are the designers of
    the olive wreath mark as Nathan correctly noticed. The font used for the ATHINA
    logo is Foundry Sans &#40;not Frutiger&#41; with some slight modifications &#40;ex.
    #2&#41;. Apart from the logo, nowhere else has any other font been used but Gill.
    <BR> <BR>And last, since it is Vincent&#39;s opening question, I am not aware
    of any assignment nor Gerry has ever mentioned, at least to me, something. Besides,
    Gill Sans Hellenic was decided as the Olympic font long before the year 2000 and
    at least anyone involved in our effort to organize the Games in Greece &#40;publishers,
    printers, designers, advertisers or licensors&#41; were well aware of that. <BR>

  body: 'My two [euro]cents:  <BR>Vince&#39;s query is not unfounded. There was indeed
    an early effort for a new Greek typeface, roundabout the time Miles did his work
    through W-O. The people then involved had a preference for Foundry Sans, therefore
    it made it into the logo. My involvement was before and shortly after the time
    of the logo; in the end it came to little, mostly for licensing reasons. No mention
    of Gill Sans was made at the time I was in the loop, but I&#39;ve been out of
    it for years.  <BR> <BR>Foundry Sans had the double benefit of a contemporary
    design, and the lack of association with the British typographical tradition;
    arguably desirable attributes in this case. Its drawback, in the context, was
    the slanted italic.  <BR> <BR>Being in Greece for the four weeks preceding the
    Games and taking in as much as I could, I can say that the whole identity thing
    clicks together pretty well. However, the <a href="http://www.athens2004.com/athens2004/page/nochildren?lang=en&amp;cid=c0a87ae4be659f00VgnVCMServer28130b0aRCRD#">

    no delay was registered with the identity, a substantial part of the works happened
    in the last few months -- so even less of an opportunity for give-and-take there...
    And, whatever you think of Phoevos &#40;which my sons like, but if they knew better
    would probably disagree with the decision to drop the proper diphthong&#41; you
    have to keep in mind that it costs just as much to get it right than to get it
