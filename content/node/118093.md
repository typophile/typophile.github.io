  body: "Good finds Dick.\r\nThe original font designer is unknown. Various digital
    fonts based on it were produced over the years under names such as Spoleto [Novel],
    OPTISport Script, and Aktuelle [Brendel].  After an earlier comparison of these
    fonts I concluded that the OPTISport Script is probably an original digitization.
    \r\nThe business card probably used one of these versions, unless it used a predigital
    source.\r\nThe [unauthorized] archive of fonts from the defunct OPTI company states
    that the pre-digital original is _Athletic Script_. This is the name the embroidery
    companies now use for this script, but I can find nothing on Athletic Script as
    a regular font. \r\nMark Bronkhorst's Mascot MVB [2012] is probably the best quality
    digital version.\r\nMike Yanega's Script Font ID Guide has a character set of
    Spoleto http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg14.html\r\nHere is a working link
    to AZ-Cut-Script https://creativemarket.com/Artistofdesign/1310-AZ-Cut-Script\r\nAs
    for the name of the font used in the card, might as well call it Athletic Script.\r\nDon\r\n"
