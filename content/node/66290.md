  with the face that's made me so comfortable with it, but what is really wrong with
  it? I don't mean Palatino Nova, but good old digital Palatino from Linotype. Last
  year I purchased a license for one of their Palatino family packs and I've been
  experimenting with it. \r\n\r\nIt seems to perform quite well at 11/13 points with
  with 10-12 words per line, printed at 1200dpi on somewhat thicker, creamy paper.
  The colour is nice and dark and the spacing seems fine. The italics in particular
  look great. It might not be designed especially for text but it seems to work. It's
  an amazingly readable face. At the very least, it doesn't seem to suffer from the
  problems characteristic of metal types translated to digital form. \r\n\r\nAm I
  missing something?"

  body: "Hrant:\r\n\r\nIdeological? How so?\r\n\r\nJames:\r\n\r\nWell I admit I do
    like the face for sentimental reasons. But perhaps that's because it worked so
    well to begin with. Perhaps I haven't read enough bad Palatino. The Linotron version
    used by Puffin Books in the mid-80s was quite charming and very sturdy. And in
    recent years digital Palatino has become even more useful (for those who want
    it) with the addition of some nice extras.\r\n\r\nWe know that Zapf didn't intend
    for Palatino to be used as a text face, but it seems to work. And although Aldus
    might be more suited to text at smaller sizes (below 10 points), it certainly
    lacks the charm and elegance of Palatino. \r\n\r\nI guess people have simply seen
    too much of it over the years."

    this be because the original designer not only oversaw the translation to digital,
    but continues to work on the typeface to this day?"

    not insignificant. Broader, more pronounced stokes, the missing bars on the E
    and F. Such an elegant lowercase f. Quite beautiful, actually.  "

    been a fan of (for non-ideological reasons). The \"p\" and \"q\" are also beauties,
    and I think I like the weird \"w\", too. The numerals are yummy, though osf \"6\"
    and \"9\" are plain wrong. I don't know what to think of the \"g\", though.\r\n\r\nEr,
    would it make me a criminal if I made a digital interpretation (no tracing, of
    course) of this? "
