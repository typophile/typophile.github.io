  body: I'm thinking it's some cut of Franklin Gothic (with the bottom of /G/ and
    /a/ cut off, of course) but I haven't found an exact match yet. Those (after-constructed)
    italics vary a great deal from version to version, mind.

  body: Yes, that is exactly what I have just been looking at. It's quite a heavy
    weight though, and I'm wondering whether it has been customized a bit?
