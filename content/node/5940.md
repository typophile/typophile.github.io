body: Hi! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a new user, seeking the font that corresponds to the Technics
  logotype. If it is of any use, I can say that Technics is an audio manufacturer,
  specializing in the best turntables ever known to humankind. Thank you for your
  help!

  body: 'Hi Flebert, Welcome to Typophile. It is helpful to us if you show us the
    type you want identified, so this time I found a Technics logo to post for you.
    It looks a bit like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/egyptian-505/egyptian505-bold/testdrive.html?s=Technics&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Egyptian 505 Bold</a> to me, or some similar slab serif: <BR><img

    out how to search the &#34;unsearchable&#34; archives of Typophile: Use Google&#39;s
    option to search within a specific domain instead of Typophile&#39;s built-in
    search. I wonder if this is how James Gareth does it?'
