  body: Alessandro has a good point - the logomark and the typographic elements compete
    with each other too much. my first thought was to see the brackets in a screen
    of black to push it back a little visually. But, When i see what Alessandro has
    done I think it works just fine without the brackets.&#60;/font&#62;

  body: Alessandro, you are right; the typographic elements, the logo, and the other
    graphics seemed to be at war with each other.  <BR>Mike, I am interested by what
    you said about the &#34;brackets behind a screen of black&#34;. Do you mean a
    black zone behind logo and bracket? <BR>Thanks for all of your help, A and M.

  body: Hey Adam, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this was mentioned, but you want all
    the important info to be on the front of the card, you can&#39;t really count
    on the recipient turning the card over.  <BR> <BR>By screening the brackets back,
    he meant turning down the opacity so they were a lighter tint.  <BR> <BR>Everything
    on the card could still be smaller, right now, the logo has alot of visual impact,
    but so does your name, which doesn&#39;t need to be that big. I do have a tendency
    to go towards smaller type, but large copy just looks bad.  <BR> <BR>Good luck.

  body: It looks great, but my comment would be to thin up the lines of the logo and
    brackets. They are way too heavy and that&#39;s one reason they compete with the
    text. The suggestion to screen them back would also help alot.

  body: That&#39;s right. I meant that you should try them at a percentage of 100%
    black. So, they would be more of a grey and not as powerful visually. <BR> <BR>Just
    a thought - not certain how it would look ...

  body: 'I want to keep the type animated on the card - so I have left the rotated
    info and tried to create some white space. Do you think that there is still a
    weakness in the layout? I am not sure but something in the composition still feels
    a bit awry.  <BR>Sorry for the small pic - I wanted to keep the resolution down
    and went a bit overboard. <BR>Dana, you are right, though: I liked the brackets
    and may try to introduce them on the screened background, as Mike suggested.'

  body: You now have a rather akward gap in the center of your card. Remember that
    a b-card also needs to be a piece of utilitarian design. Looking at your card,
    I wouldn&#39;t know which way to hold it. <BR> <BR>Also, have you considered reducing
    the logo? It&#39;s a very nice logo and I don&#39;t think it needs to be &#39;shouting&#39;.
