body: okay, maybe there&#39;s another forum that deals specificaly with OT development,
  but i haven&#39;t got hooked on it yet... so i&#39;ll post this one here untill
  i find a better place to post such questions. <BR> <BR>so my trouble is this...
  i&#39;m working on a blackletter that incorporates the long s into the design. what
  are the rules for using the long s? are they really hard and fast or were/are they
  up to the discression of the scribe/designer. if i understand correctly the only
  constant is that the small s is used at the end of words, which leads into my problem...
  <BR> <BR>is the best way to incorporate the long s simply to <BR><i>sub s by longs</i>
  in the hlig feature? i&#39;ve tried <i>sub s&#39; @classX by longs</i> where classX
  is any letter and this seems to work fine, but when there are two s&#39;s at the
  end of a word this doesn&#39;t work as it ends in long s followed by an s and it
  just looks goofy. <BR> <BR>anyhow, any help or suggestions would be helpful. thnx
  in advance.

  body: The long s substitution should be in hist, not hlig. <BR> <BR>hlig is really
    for ct and st ligs. You do however also need a &#34;long s &#43; s&#34; lig, as
    you have discovered. That might as well go in regular old liga, since if you&#39;ve
    already got the long s in there, you want it to be a default ligature. <BR> <BR>The
    long s &#43; s ligature is also the origin of the German double s character &#40;eszett&#41;.

  body: thnx again for your help, thom.  now i have more questions... <BR> <BR>what
    does the &#34;long s &#43; s&#34; lig actually look like/consist of? <BR>when
    is it used? <BR>I was actually aware of the origin of the eszett, but the long
    s followed by the short s looks funny in English. What i&#39;d like to happen
    is for the substitution to be ignored when two s&#39;s fall at the end of the
    word, is that where the &#34;long s &#43; s&#34; lig comes in? <BR> <BR>More about
    OT programming... what is the best way to get up to speed in learning some of
    the more complicated stuff? and learning about such tricks as special ligatures?
    is that all on the OT FDK forums? Are there any other resources on the web or
    in print that i can get my hands on? I&#39;m aware of Adobe&#39;s forum, that
    Microsoft has quite about about font development on their pages and that there
    is another forum for OT development on MSN... am i just not taking good enough
    advantage of these resources? is there something i&#39;m missing here? any insight/explanation
    of these resources &#40;and others i may have missed&#41; would help a lot. thanks
    again for your help. <BR> <BR>VOLT... that must be the MSN group i&#39;m thinking
    of...

  body: Hmmm. I&#39;m not sure I can describe it really easily. <BR> <BR>Huh. I just
    went to look at it in one of our glyph complement PDFs, and it seems that isn&#39;t
    a ligature in Adobe Jenson Pro &#40;although there are a ton of long s ligatures&#41;.
    I wonder if I am completely hallucinating this.... It isn&#39;t as if I&#39;ve
    done any work in this genre myself in the last 5-6 years. <BR> <BR>As for the
    OT programming aspect, this forum is pretty good. The FontLab forum on MSN is
    good. The OT mailing list is decent. The VOLT forum isn&#39;t bad. There are also
    occasional workshops and stuff at type conferences. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Paul,  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to incorporate contextual
    substitutions of the long-s. Depending on the language used, the rules were very
    different. So for English, the rules are fairly simple, but for example for German,
    they aren&#39;t. The short s is not only used at the end of words, but also, in
    compound words, the short s is used where a prefix or a stem ends. For example,
    in &#34;ansteigen&#34; &#40;because it&#39;s &#34;an|steigen&#34;&#41;, you would
    have a long s but in &#34;austrinken&#34; you would have a short s &#40;as it&#39;s
    &#34;aus|trinken&#34;&#41;. Similarly, there are special rules for French, or
    Polish, or other languages that used long s in the past.  <BR> <BR>Therefore,
    it&#39;s impossible to build a proper universal contextual substitution mechanism.
    IMVHO, it doesn&#39;t make sense to make rules that would only work in one language
    &#40;e.g. English&#41; but perhaps actually break other languages.  <BR> <BR>As
    for the correct form of a ligature long s &#43; short s, I do recommend to look
    at _well-designed_ sharp s &#40;

  body: hey adam, <BR>thanks for enlightening me further on the troubles with automated
    long s substitutions. but i thought with OT one could implement different rules
    for different languages? how does the hist feature work anyway? is it automatic?
    or does it work more like the salt function where the user has to select the long
    s from from a glyph palete? or is it sometimes automatic?

  body: 'Paul,  <BR> <BR>there is no such thing as &#34;how does the hist feature
    work anyway&#34; ;&#41; Application developers may choose several ways to implement
    the feature.  <BR> <BR>The OpenType specification:  <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist"
    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist</a>
    <BR>says that the feature should work as a GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. a simple substitution.
    This means that contextual substitutions should not be used.  <BR> <BR>Microsoft&#39;s
    Longhorn OpenType Layout implementation enumerates HinstoricalForms as &#34;boolean&#34;
    so it will be just an on/off function, just like ligatures in InDesign.  <BR><a
    href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx"
    target="_blank">http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx</a>
    <BR> <BR>AFAIK, Adobe InDesign doesn&#39;t currently support the &#34;hist&#34;
    feature other than by the Glyphs palette, but may add an &#34;on/off&#34; support
    in future.  <BR> <BR>It is possible to implement different substitutions rules
    for different languages. However, &#40;1&#41; the OpenType specification recommends
    using only GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. simple substitutions &#40;not contextual substitutions&#41;
    for the feature. &#40;2&#41; As I explained earlier, a properly working contextual
    &#34;hist&#34; feature for many languages would be simply impossible to build,
    just like a properly working contextual ligatures feature that would substitute
    &#34;fi&#34; or &#34;fl&#34; ligatures -- in German, you are allowed to put the
    &#34;fl&#34; ligature in &#34;anfliegen&#34; but not in &#34;auflegen&#34;, because
    the former is &#34;an|fliegen&#34; and the latter is &#34;auf|legen&#34;. You
    are not allowed to put ligatures between a prefix and a stem. Supporting this
    in an automatic way would require dictionary support so it&#39;s not really possible
    to solve it within a font.  <BR> <BR>Therefore, I recommend implementing the &#34;hist&#34;
    feature just using a simple substitution:  <BR> <BR>sub s by long <BR> <BR>and
    let the user turn it on and off locally where required.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

    <BR> <BR>i realised this as i thought about it a bit longer yesterday. thanks
    for taking your time to make sure i really understand this issue. anyway a simple
    &#34;sub s by long s&#34; is a lot easier to implement. <BR>and who needs a workshop
    when you&#39;ve got Adam T. to answer all your silly questions. ;^&#41; thanks
    again! <BR> <BR>and i&#39;ve got another question... is &#34;Longhorn&#34; the
    next generation of Windows? or did i get that wrong too?

  body: I do not know what the legit method of implementation is, but I got the ligature
    subsitutions to work the way I have see it most often done by programming a series
    of substitutions in the calt feature. &#40;I used calt because that is one that
    is easily accessible in InDesign.&#41; Of course, I am free to program this however
    I want since this font is only for personal use anyway, so my method might not
    be appropriate for you. Let me know if you want to see how I wrote the subs. <img
