  with no further ado we give you \u2013 <strong>Orbe</strong> designed by <strong>[[http://www.fountain.nu/designers/ruiabreu.asp|Rui
  Abreu]]</strong>.\r\n\r\nTake a peek at:\r\n[[http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe.asp]]\r\n\r\nRui
  has also made a nice promotion video:\r\n[[http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe_video.asp]]\r\n\r\nDownload
  PDF:\r\nhttp://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN_Orbe.pdf\r\n\r\nOrbe is a blackletter
  font intended to interpret the feel of Portuguese calligraphy. It's name, the portuguese
  for \"orb\" or \"globe\", evokes the enclosed beauty and consistency of shapes that
  naturally cohere in the calligraphic expression.\r\n\r\nWith a light and spontaneous
  feel, it's also exotic with it's flourished details, which makes it a very nice
  decorative and titling font. The glyphs are a mix of lowercases and uppercases,
  all aligned at same height, as if the uppercase forms of some letters evolved by
  speed of gesture to lowercase forms. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Fountain's first OpenType
  release and features a full CE supported character set, and fancy ligatures. \r\n\r\nAbout
  Fountain:\r\nFountain is an independent and friendly digital type foundry based
  in Malm\xF6, Sweden. We've been sending out nice typefaces to the world since 1993."
