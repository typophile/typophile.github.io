  body: "Avant Garde is riding the crest of a big comeback, after being relegated
    to unusable stack because of its heavy use back in the day. Herb Lubalin designed
    it for use by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant_Garde_(magazine)\">Avant
    Garde</a> magazine. Those alternates that Renko mentioned are crucial to making
    Avant Garde work, so make sure you license those as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and typically
    the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">Type ID boards</a> on Typophile
    are a better spot for type ID requests."
