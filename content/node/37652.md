  blog.\r\n\r\nHer blog is called 'fartings'. Apart from insisting on lowercase, all
  ideas have been left to myself, including font and colour choice. Point size is
  52 (Blue Highway) and 20 for the script (Dali), and is for Web only. I have not
  done any alternatives (yet!)\r\n\r\nThe blog is personal, with a fairly direct slant,
  without, hopefully, being offensive.\r\n\r\nI haven't shown her the results yet
  and  would be very grateful if I could have the benefit of some critique. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/fartings_6158.gif]"

  body: "Hi There.\r\nI like the contrast between the typefaces but I find the \"just
    read it\" hard to read. I am not sure how big it will be on the blog, but the
    thin parts of the letters seem to be getting lost. Could another hand-written
    like font be substituted, perhaps one that might perform on the screen a bit better?\r\n"

  body: "I chose Dali script for the 'just read it' subtitle because, to me, it suggests
    a quick, almost knee-jerk outpouring of thoughts and ideas, and supports the self
    deprecating blog-site title.  I felt it important to use a script which most closely
    mimics handwriting, rather than a script with separate characters and that the
    thin strokes in the text support the desired effect. It's quite possible I may
    be completely wrong. The size of the graphic will be the same size as is shown
    here.\r\n\r\nI have tried other, more legible script fonts such as Ginette or
    Georges, but they don't appear to match the 'take it or leave it' attitude the
    owner wishes to impart on the site, while, of course, ensuring the whole is constructed
    with the greatest care and belies the thoughtful, carefully-constructed writing
    in posts."
