  over but I quite like the form and would like to work on it and refine it further.Initally
  I had reversed the 2 to form the 7 but then the 7 looked a little odd so I had to
  crop a bit of its tail while extending it for the 2. So please tell me what I need
  to do to it. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/convo_4300.jpg]\r\n\r\nVinu
