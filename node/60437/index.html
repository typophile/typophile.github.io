  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Take a look at this new card, designed by Dimitri Scheblanov ( dimitrischeblanov.com )



Printed on Rives BFK 260gsm fine art paper (Arches Mill, France) with duotone offset litho for the watercolor wash, type is letterpress from photopolymer plates on the Heidelberg Windmill 10x15 (Red ball ca 1960)

The design is just gorgeous. I was concerned about the tiny type, but I'm always amazed by the polymer and the Heidelberg Windmill! 

There will always some minor variation through the print run, as I'm constantly tweaking the press (roller height, ink load) to make the best possible impression.

The trick with this 'mouse' type is to get enough ink on it without losing the definition. You can see below that the  [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/3769451684/in/set-72157621758713049/| '-'s around 'BASTA SURF' are about three half-tone dots long!]]

The ink is a very fine litho black with a hint of green added, and stiffened with magnesium carbonate. 
The "mag" is necessary to 'shorten' the ink. Litho ink is runny and would tend to blur the edges of the type. "Short" ink is stiffer, and sticks to the printing surface with slurring. Of course roller setting is absolutely critical in a job of this sort (well, any job really), since the extremely fine details will easily be slurred and mushed over by a low roller. The Heidelberg is the pinnacle of platen press evolution, and amongst other things, allows for extremely fine control over the roller height.

Also, a bit of business news:
Thanks to the credit crunch, we're facing a serious survival test. One of our banks is raising the minimum monthly payment from 2% to 5% of our total balance. That's 150% increase in the monthly payments. It's literally enough to sink us if something doesn't change, and fast!
So, please keep us in mind for exquisite letterpress printing. Our quality/price ratio is about as high as you'll find anywhere in the world these days ;-) 

"Slow Print, High Touch!"
Use it or lose it ;-)

By the way, we've been extremely gratified by Typophile.com readers, who have regularly spiked the slowprint.com site to 300-400% of our normal daily traffic!
Thanks for your support and consideration!

That tiny type is probably about 2-points high!

Where I'm discussing the additional of Mag Carbonate to the ink:

"The “mag” is necessary to ’shorten’ the ink. Litho ink is runny and would tend to blur the edges of the type. “Short” ink is stiffer, and sticks to the printing surface with slurring. "

should be "...withOUT slurring" ;-)
