    say almost all transitional typefaces will work well, so would modern bracketed
    ones with not too much stroke contrast like Century. Perhaps take a look at what
    Font Bureau is suggesting to be compatible with Benton on the right side here:

    shown here) lends itself to this kind of effect because, with no thinning at the
    joints (owing to the abrupt angle at which curves intersect with straights), it
    is very monolinear. Similarly, there must be no bracketing of the display didone
    serifs. Berthold Bodoni shown here. You have to get the relative sizes just right;
    for larger display type, use Bauer Bodoni."
