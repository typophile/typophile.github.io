  (the font is beautiful as well)! Alas, I cannot identify the font. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I see this guy popping up everywhere. Any clues?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elephant_5_012_6613.jpeg]"

  body: "Those are two different ampersands. \r\n\r\nThe first one is, I believe,
    set in Caslon. The ampersand likely from the italic version. \r\n\r\nThe second
    one, alas, has me stumped. "

  body: "Sorry, I was unclear, I know they are different ampersands. The first typeface
    does look similar to Caslon but it is wider, and the serifs on the \"S\" are different.
    Also, this ampersand is slightly more decorative than the italic Caslon ampersand.
    Thanks for the help though!\r\n\r\n"

  body: A closer photo might help. I am pretty sure the first one is one of the many
    Caslon incarnations.

  body: "I created an ampersand collage for a project about a week ago. In other words,
    I pretty much viewed every ampersand in my font library. \r\n\r\nWhile the examples
    below may not be an exact match to yours, they are certainly close. The first
    version of baskerville is a specific version copyrighted and trademarked by a
    large company. Never fear, I am not a pirate. These fonts were given to me by
    the company and their characters have never left the artboard of my computer screen
    (until now, right?)\r\n\r\nHow does that work? I guess if you own the copyright
    to a font/s, you can give them to whoever you wish, correct?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2011-10-25_21-47-39_5284.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah, my avatar is the bold italic ampersand from my [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]]. I don't know if Caslon was the first one to do this style. Probably
    not, and he certainly wasn't the last, but is the best known. The larger sizes
    are higher contrast and more curly. There isn't one single design, even in the
    originals of Caslon. The curves on mine were kind of inspired also by the old
    fashioned baby \"pram\" in England.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't identify the
    ones above.  "
