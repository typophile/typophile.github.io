  body: "Three different e's, three different n's, two different o's. Most likely
    not a font but real honest-to-paper-and-pen handwriting. While it's possible that
    it's an elaborate open-type font with dozens of dynamic and/or positional alternates,
    for this particular use I would find that possibility very remote.\r\n\r\n  -
