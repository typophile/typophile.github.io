body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for an opentype testsheet (indesign or worddoc?)
  with which I can check a font I\u2019m working on in various language settings and
  which shows the exotic characters (foreign languages, Math Characters etc) in real
  context. Probably as everyone else, I\u2019m having a hard time designing and spacing
  characters which I don\u2019t know their exact use.\r\nIs there something like this
  available?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n( I posted the same thing in \"Design\".
  Wasn't sure where it's best to ask)"

  body: "Nick's link is good, but some languages' text is presented as an image (e.g.
    <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/bng.htm\">Bengali</a>). Luckily, the
    [[UDHR in Unicode]] project is fixing that. Here's the link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/udhr/"

  body: I've also noticed that some of the Cyrillic texts at the UN cheat--i.e. they
    have some Latin letters (A, Y, P etc.) mixed in with the Cyrillic characters.
