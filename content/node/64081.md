  body: "You don't have enough Key letters in that sample, but if you have a more
    extensive sample including a, e, g, G, M, R and y you can try it yourself with
    the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans Serif ID Guide]]
    interactive version (beta). Just the a, e and y gave 184 choices, which was hard
    to narrow down. Could be Akzidenz Grotesk, perhaps, but more letters would help.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Hate to spoil it, but it doesn't look like Monotype Grotesque to me. It's
    similar though.

  body: Oh dear...it's very, very close, but I've just looked at some numerals and
    they seem slightly different to the numerals here http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/grotesque-mt/
    . Are there variants of this font which might explain the slight differences?

    magazine before 1985 posted. Thanks for all your help.
