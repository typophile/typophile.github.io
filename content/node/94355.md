body: "June 30, 2012\r\nI'm proud to announce the released of Corbeau Pro, my third
  typeface family. This typeface was created with the invaluable advice of Fred Smeijers
  and the support of Corina Cotorobai and Rudy Geeraerts from Ourtype Foundry.\r\n\r\nOurType
  Corbeau Pro, is a special addition to OurType\u2019s collection of sans serif typefaces.
  Integrating gentle curves into an overall programme of squarish forms. Corbeau was
  drawn on the lessons of predecessors such as Eurostile and FF Meta to arrive at
  fully contemporary design. The design is precise and approachable, and in keeping
  with the geometry of the roman, a slanted roman is partnered to it. The result is
  an open, uncomplicated typeface that is easy to use for everyday typography of all
  kinds. The generous range of weights and the proportions and details of its several
  widths give Corbeau an impressive efficiency in text settings and a commanding presence
  in display.\r\n\r\nThe Corbeau family consists of eight weights of roman and slanted
  italic designs, each in three widths: condensed, normal and extended. The character
  set includes small caps; lining, oldstyle and small cap figures (each in tabular
  and proportional widths); fractions; comprehensive scientific superiors and inferiors,
  numerators and denominators; case sensitive punctuation sets; mathematical and monetary
  symbols (in tabular and proportional widths); arrows; standard and discretionary
  ligatures; and a complete range of accents for all Western, Central and East European
  languages based on the Latin script.\r\n\r\nCorbeau was completed with Fred Smeijers,
  and produced and released by OurType in 2012. Available in OpenType PRO at https://ourtype.com/\r\n\r\nFinally,
  many thanks to my wife Constance and my daughter Jade. \u2014Andr\xE9 Simard\r\n\r\n<a
