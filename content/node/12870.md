  seem to work anymore.\r\n\r\nHowever, again I need your help finding a font for
  a football team. This time it's the german top club FC Bayern M\xFCnchen who have
  got a new lettering style along with their next seasons home kit. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time.\r\n"

    letters and they're not the same.\r\n\r\nDo you have any others idea?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: 'I think its an adaptation of Industria, so there is no font coming closer
    to it than Industria. Just like the current Nike numbers that look like - but
    are different from - DIN Engschrift, the Adidas numbers that are very close to
    Serpentine and he numbers in the FA Premier League that are based on Optima Black. '
