  body: I&#39;m still somewhat unsure if it&#39;s suposed to be a &#34;script&#34;
    font or not, hence the name. <BR> <BR>My plan is to use it for section titles
    on my website. I didn&#39;t spend too much time on kerning, because I felt that
    it would be easier to kern it by hand when applying it. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/580.gif"

  body: ' My impression is that you&#39;re going to need a good number of alternates
    to make this work as a script - but it&#39;s a great idea! <BR> <BR>BTW: <BR>1.
    I think your lc &#34;s&#34; can be confused for an &#34;8&#34; in some contexts.
    <BR>2. The lc &#34;g&#34; is descending an extra pixel. <BR>3. You might try making
    the lc &#34;f&#34; descend. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Jonathan,  <BR> <BR>I echo Hrant&#39;s comments. Looks like the &#39;f&#39;
    does <BR>descend, but try another pixel. I really enjoy <BR>the tapering terminals
    &#40;f, p, K, R&#41;. It gives <BR>the thing a nice blackletter feel without <BR>sacrificing
    legibility. Very nice start. <BR> <BR>One more idea: drop the script tails on
    the  <BR>numerals. I&#39;m not sure they need to be a part  <BR>of a connected
    line. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' I would agree with everything that&#39;s been posted so far. <BR> <BR>On
    the lc &#34;s&#34;, why not experiment with even more of a cursive form, dropping
    the upper loop altogether and widening the lower one? <BR> <BR>Regarding that
    lc &#34;g&#34;, I like the look of the elongated lower loop, but it does stand
    out from the other glyphs. I think Hrant&#39;s suggestion to vertically condense
    the lower loop by a pixel is a good one. <BR> <BR>The only other suggestion I
    have is to check the &#34;M&#34; and &#34;N&#34;, as well as the &#34;U&#34;,
    &#34;V&#34; and &#34;W&#34;. When set together, these characters seem to be running
    in to each other a bit, causing some legibility problems. Perhaps adjusting the
    script connectors somehow would help, or maybe a pixel of kerning added to these
    letter combinations.... <BR> <BR>It strikes me that these forms would make an
    interesting vector-based font as well. Nice work. '

  body: Fun. It reminds me of Matthew Bardram&#39;s  <BR>Scriptometer &#40;with a
    larger cap height?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I was skeptical of Scriptometer at first but  <BR>actually
    grew quite fond of it. &#40;In the  <BR><A HREF="http://typophile.com/articles/bardram"
    TARGET="_top">Bardram interview</A> here.&#41; <BR> <BR>As to Hrant&#39;s suggestion
    for alternates-- <BR>although it might add some depth to the face,  <BR>I&#39;m
    not convinced it&#39;s necessary. <BR> <BR>I agree with Stephen about the numerals.

    <BR>I especially like the idea of giving the lc &#34;s&#34; its cursive form.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try and work on it some tonight, and post the results tomorrow.

    &#40;with the connectors activated, anyway&#41; still read like one long piece
    of hard ribbon candy. &#40;Mmmmm, hard ribbon candy....!&#41; I guess it&#39;s
    sort of the point of the connectors, and I must admit, the connectors most probably
    wouldn&#39;t be used with this combination in the caps all that often, but it
    still might warrant one more look. <BR> <BR>And if that&#39;s the only criticism
    I can come up with on second draft, I&#39;d say you&#39;re on to something here.

  body: ' Thanks, Hrant, David - I really appreciate you taking the time to give me
    pointers and encouragement. I&#39;m relatively new to font making, so it&#39;s
    good to hear feedback from people who already know what they&#39;re doing. <BR>
    <BR>As for the &#34;U&#34;,&#34;V&#34; and &#34;W&#34; I&#39;ve tried several
    different ways of connecting them, but can&#39;t seem to avoid the appearance
    of them all running together. &#40;Yes, Mmmmmmm, ribbon candy!&#41; However, I
    agree that it is unlikely that this issue will come up very often in &#34;real
    life&#34;. <BR> <BR>In response to something you said in your first post - I originally
    created Vacillation as a vector based font &#40;.ttf for PC&#41;, so if you&#39;d
    like a copy of it I&#39;d be more than happy to email it to you. &#40;If you'
