  a customer can type in their printing information & see how it will look to view
  the different fonts we offer available for them to order.\r\n as like this showing\r\nhttp://www.typetester.org/\r\n\r\n
  I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me learn or know where to go for
  such a script to do this on my web site or if you offer this.\r\n\r\n Thank you
  for your time\r\n Edward\r\n"
