body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone could point me to any directions of stable
  type proportions? I have been printing out typefaces and tracing them and even trying
  to &#39;measure&#39; different parts of a face to try and understand the consistency
  of proportions of different faces but I don&#39;t really &#39;see&#39; it. Does
  this make sense? Or am I just diseased with the &#39;rationalize everything&#39;
  virus? <BR> <BR>

    useful web site refers to a German book by Peter Karow, &#39;Schriftstatistik&#39;
    &#40;URW Verlag, Hamburg 1992, which is full of detailed numbers on type proportions.  <BR>

    - referred to at Typographi.ca - is also very interesting.
