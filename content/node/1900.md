body: 'I am interested in design / type styles of the first two decades of the twentieth
  century: 1900-1919. What I&#39;m looking for, specifically, are designs that are
  not Arts &amp; Crafts or Art Nouveau, but more of a general commercial vernacular
  from this era &#40;advertisements, logos, signage, package designs, etc.&#41; <BR>
  <BR>It seems that the design history books I have are pretty thin on this period,
  especially regarding things that don&#39;t fit into a larger movement &#40;such
  as Arts &amp; Crafts, Deco--which I know came later, and so on&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  done a search on MyFonts.com, and found some good type examples, but I&#39;d also
  like to see more full-blown designs of type in use.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any
  suggestions of books or other resources I could try? <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help,
  <BR> <BR>Troy'

    2 mil.&#41; we have a number of stores that trade and sell old magazines, comic-books,
    paper ephemera. And a sub-culture of collectors and dealers, with bi-annual &#34;Old
    Paper Show and Sale&#34;. Antique stores often have old magazines. The magazines
    are not expensive. <BR> <BR>I would imagine that things are the same in most big
    cities. <BR> <BR>So I would recommend rummaging, with a copy of McGrew&#39;s &#34;American
    Metal typefaces of the Twentieth century&#34; &#40;Oak Knoll&#41; to identify
    the faces in the publications.

    journals &#40;on printing&#41; that were available at about this time: Inland
    Printer, British Printer, The Graphic Arts, The American Printer, etc. Most major
    University library collections would carry these. <BR> <BR>These are very useful
    in seeing how things changed from decade to decade, especially in regard to typeface
    offerings. The late 20s and the early 30s are the heydays typographically,but
    some very interesting, and unsual, typeface entries can be found from the late
    1890s up into the 20s. <BR> <BR>Gerald'
