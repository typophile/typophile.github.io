  body: "There still are subtle differences, some of which could be due to a sort
    of emboldening/shadowing (depth of counters on |R|, |N|, and |W|, for example),
    or modifications (|A|\u2019s crossbar, maybe |P|\u2019s bowl height, and |M|\u2019s
    bottom vertex).\r\nDepending on the origin of the sample, it could be a non-digital
    cut of the typeface."

  body: "Yes, the embossed effect makes it difficult to determine the precise outline
    of the letters to which it was applied. Could be a narrow letter that was thickened
    or a thicker one that was narrowed. \r\nHelvetica Ultra Condensed is a fair fit,
    but is not the only possible source. There grotesques from the 19th century that
    are not all that different.\r\nThis could also be pure lettering and not a font
    as such. This would be consistent with the craft ethos of this company. http://nydistilling.com/about/

  body: 'Can''t find a perfect match for this one with such /K but as Don said, probably
    a customization based on /R. More alternatives, possibly closer than Helvetica
