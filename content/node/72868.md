  body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nI was looking for a font that is similar to Adobe Clean
    because of Adobe Clean is not available to purchase. Few minutes ago I found it,
    downloaded and now using. (Yes, a bit illegal)\r\n\r\nSo, there is no need to
    find similars of Adobe Clean for me.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIf anybody wants to use similar
    of Adobe Clean, he should try \"Aller\" and \"Dax\".\r\n\r\nBtw, thanks @sii."

    seriously. Adobe Clean is the property of Adobe Systems, for its private use.
    It doesn't matter if you want/need it for private use or anything else.\r\n\r\nNote
    that you're in a forum populated by professional font creators and you're talking
    about stealing fonts. Smileys don't help."

    constitutes the unlawful or fraudulent removal of another\u2019s property without
    the owner\u2019s consent.\r\n\r\nthis is not the case with software \u201Cpiracy,\u201D
    where the proprietors still have unrestricted access to their property (read:
    the software or the original copies). it would rather be unauthorized use due
    to the lack of a valid license.\r\n\r\nillegal yes, but a different offense."

  body: "Hello everybody. I just saw this post. And I think that Adobe Clean resembles
    many features of Corisande. I am not sure if directly tweaked from it (specially
    considering identical corpus sizes, shape sizes, the striking similarities of
    i.e. l, c and o, that is always difficult to assure) but no doubt it is highly
    related. Probably not as dramatic as Frutiger and Myriad :-) \r\nA similar but
    clearly divergent option is Aller. Or, of course, Etelka, Phoenica, Accord Alt
    or Beau Sans\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cats-crop_5834.jpg]"

  body: "<em>\"A 'bit illegal' is like being 'a bit pregnant,' right?\"</em>\r\n\r\nIs
    a rolling stop at an intersection with no other cars around totally illegal or
    just a bit illegal? I think we are overloaded with lawyers, courts, judges, and
    juries because a bit illegal is more like a bit overweight \u2014 purely in the
    eye of the beholder. \r\n\r\nNo blood, no foul. How much blood has this petty
    unauthorized usage drawn from Adobe? Yes it's illegal, but only in the most trivial
    way.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I'm not sure why anyone would bother to swipe Clean in the
    first place. Sure, Arno Pro is worthy, but Clean? Seriously?\r\n\r\n\u2014 F.

    similar enough to recommend the former in place of the latter, do you think that
    similarity was a coincidence?\r\n\r\nBTW the two threads you've participated in
    are both by nenasilniye*, who's been inactive for about 2.5 years. And in one
    of those threads your post seems to have gone missing. No pressure (note that
    I'm not a moderator or anything like that) but it would be nice if you could explain.\r\n\r\n*
