  body: I love the hidden arrow in the fedex logo.  Kind of reminds me of the W/H
    combination in the old <a href="http://sjsharkie.dagnabit.org/images/hartford_whalers_1996.gif">Hartford
    Whalers logo</a>.

  body: I didn&#39;t mean you, I meant Landor &#40;or whoever&#41;. Thinking the arrow
    is cool ain&#39;t so bad, but realizing it should be prominent enough for non-designers
    to actually notice it is better. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re right, it was Landor. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s wrong
    with being subtle, adding a little more than can be understood at a glance?  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only designers that notice it.

  body: I agree Graham. Mystery and discovery are nice. We need more of it. <BR> <BR>People
    love the logo because they think they were the first to discover it &#40;the arrow&#41;.
    I think it promotes brand loyalty. <BR> <BR>smc

  body: Do you think that they had the arrow in mind when they were re-working the
    brand id &#40;or&#41; did they see it in some of the comps and tried to find a
    typeface that would <b>really</b> show the arrow?

  body: 'The best comment regarding the FedEx logo, posted  <BR>here a year ago: <BR>
    <BR>&#34;As for the &#34;hidden arrow&#34; in the FedEx logo, I&#39;ve always  <BR>thought
    this smelled of aftermarket rationale. Personally  <BR>I wished they&#39;d noticed
    that between the &#39;e&#39; and &#39;d&#39; is a  <BR>hidden butter knife.&#34;

  body: 'When I saw the recently redone Hilton logo for the first time, I didn&#39;t
    think much of it. Some time later, while I was watching some sports event on television,
    I saw an animated version of the logo, as Hilton was a sponsor of the game. At
    first it was just the two vertical bars, and then the swirl came in and the whole
    thing became the H-mark. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/4508.gif"
    alt="hilton logo"> <BR> <BR>Suddenly I was really impressed because I now understood
    that the vertical bars actually stood for the &#34;pause&#34; symbol, and I thought
    it was a very clever visual joke about what one does when one stays at a hotel:
    it&#39;s a pause in someone&#39;s life. <BR> <BR>I wrote to the designers to express
    my appreciation. They responded that it had never occurred to them. <BR> <BR>I
    do recall, however, that the Landor arrow thing was intentional. <BR>'

  body: Wow -- I&#39;d always assumed it was some version of Futura. Now that I&#39;ve
    tried to set the letters myself, I guess they did do some tweaking to the letterforms.
    But there&#39;s no doubt in my mind as to what they started from.

  body: FedEx - I am still aghast at how many designers believe this <BR>mark was
    an accident. The arrow is planned, it is perfect, <BR>and I think the end result
    is very smart. I&#39;m with Hicks. <BR> <BR>Hilton - I have yet to find a national
    hotel chain thinks that <BR>deeply about design, but I applaud Cheshey&#39;s effort
    to give  <BR>them credit nonetheless. Hehe. That&#39;s a great story.
