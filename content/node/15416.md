  body: "No, it's something in between! Like Helv it has a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108076.0.11&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=EMERGENCY&sampleSize=48\">bearded
    G</a>, but like Arial the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.6.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=EMERGENCY&sampleSize=48\">C
    terminals</a> are angled. Hmm.\r\n\r\nClosest to Helv tho. Maybe a weird signmaker's
    variation."

  body: "I think you were right the first time about EMERGENCY being Helvetica. The
    apparent slight angles on the C and G could just be due to the low resolution
    of the sample, which is not quite straight.\r\n\r\nHelp Wanted is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/compacta_bold/?sample_text=Help%20Wanted&sample_size=96\">Compacta</a>"
