body: 'Calling all Typophiles, I need your help. <BR> <BR>The company I work for is
  currently examining its style guide &#40;or lack thereof&#41;, which is opening
  up possibilities for changes. <BR> <BR>Currently we use ::shudder:: Condensed Helveticas
  for titling/ display and Times/ TNR for text. The Helveticas aren&#39;t up for debate,
  but the text face is. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re a Dutch company, so I&#39;m thinking that
  along with all of the obvious arguments against Times, I&#39;d use the origin of
  the type/ designer as secondary leverage and a way to narrow the field a bit. <BR>
  <BR>So, I know some of the foundries, such as DTL and TEFF, and some designers such
  as Majoor and Smeihjers, but I don&#39;t have a voluminous knowledge of Dutch Foundries,
  designers, and serif faces. What I need is a list to start examining examples from
  so I can hit them with a list of options that I&#39;ve culled from a greater one.
  Any help is very, very much appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks for any suggestions. <BR>
  <BR>PS: Wim Crouwel might be a bit too avante garde for our needs.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Yeah, I saw it mentioned on one of sites and it looks fascinating, particularly
    since I&#39;m growing more and more fond of Dutch type &#40;especially after today&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Do you have it? If so, what&#39;s the content like?

  body: Thanks for the link, Stephen. Before today, I was sure that the House Industries
    book &#43; fonts package was what I was going to force my wife to buy for my birthday
    next month. After looking at the Dutch type book, though, I&#39;m not so sure.
    Beautiful!

  body: This satisfied consumer thinks that the Dutch Type book is fantastic! I just
    picked it up last week in New York and I&#39;ve been singing its praises to all
    my designer friends ever since. It&#39;s got the rare combination of a substantial
    amount of text &#40;that is actually interesting to read&#41; and a ton of great
    images. It&#39;s so good, it made me consider going to a grad program in the Netherlands.
    Or that might just be the current economy. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
