  body: I think they shouldn't hold their breath waiting on the cease and desist letter
    from Paramount. They may have received a trademark from the USPTO. But I don't
    think it has a chance of standing up to an appeal from Paramount. Beyond the trademark
    problem is the problem of copyright. Even if they win the trademark case, I think
    their use of this as a logo will be destroyed as a blatant violation of copyright.

    than this one. Since your client has no concern for ethics, appeal to his wallet:
    Help him realize that by using a stolen logo he is in jeopardy. He''ll spend a
    lot of money producing stuff with this logo, and quite likely if Paramount sees
    it they''re going to make him throw it all away. His silly trademark "registration"
    means nothing. You are not ethically out of line for trying to get him to do an
    original logo; quite the opposite. Would you be ethically out of line to anonymously
    send a copy of his ripoff to Paramount legal and let them convince him what to
    do? Probably. But it sure would be fun.'

    a professional logo designer was invovled with it. "

    design issued by the Navy? Certainly the Navy isn't going to sue Paramount for
    adapting a (non-copyrighted, Government-created) logo for their brilliant bit
    of marketing / propaganda, so why would Paramount care if someone else ripped

  body: "I searched the USPTO site and you are right. It looks like the Department
    of the Navy has registered that trademark. My guess would be that Paramount actually
    created the mark and it has been given to the Navy as part of the many dealings
    that go into producing and marketing a movie like that. Either way I'm certain
    there is a legal deal established for licensing the rights to use that mark by
    Paramount. Just like there had to be a mountain of legal documents covering the
    use of all of the Navy jets, ships, personel and property used to film the movie.\r\n\r\nSo
    maybe you are right and we are making unfounded assumptions. Just like I assume
    that a corporation like Paramount has negotiated usage rights for that registered
    trademark, maybe the company printninja mentions has licensed the usage of that
    mark too."

    of a friend who knows computers\" design this for them.  I'd eat my cordless mouse
    if they hired a pro, or got permission from the Navy.  \r\n\r\nI really don't
    care if this company gets sued.  I was just trying to give them a bit if friendly
    advice, because at one time they were looking to build a motorsports complex in
    our County. \r\n\r\nAs a professional designer, I feel tempted to \"drop the dime\"
    on them, because this stuff really ticks me off, but at the same time I have no
    need of enemies. \r\n\r\nI'm sure they'll get noticed, eventually."

    He (Tom Cruise) lost a bit of weight for his last movie. I saw him on the TV just
    the past couple of weeks. Wish I could lose weight AND not have any ill effects.\r\n\r\nA
    few years ago, there was a robber who wore a 'TOP GUN' hat when he did his heists.
    Wonder if Paramount could prosecute him for Trademark infringement? (Of course,
    I believe HE REALLY had a working gun). Don't know if he'll get that hat back
    after serving time.\r\n\r\nOf course its an obvious infringement. Call Paramount
    and see how much they would pay you to tell them about someone infringing copyright.
    I wouldn't point it out to them without compensation.\r\n\r\n"
