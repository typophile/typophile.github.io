<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi Everyone.
My name is Jesse and I currently work as a CNC Operator in an engraving shop. I have a font dilemma, I am currently working a project for a customer and need to find out what font is used for the 2006 Liberty Silver Dollar. I have searched high and low and am not able to find it. Is this a special font used by the Tresury Dept? I would appreciate any help.
Thank you for your time and assistance.
Jesse </div>

<div class=commentbody>The typeface used on a '2006 Liberty Silver Dollar'? I am pretty sure that that one would be custom. <em>( I dont think noone ever used existing, available type for money and currencies. )</em> Anyway, If you could post a sample image, someone may actually be able to help you with alternate typeface suggestions.

<div class=commentbody>I didn't think any coins used type, either -- I figured the lettering was always designed by the sculptor who designed the coin. But you're right! They used both Univers and Arial. What a disgrace. The Arial doesn't even curve evenly: the type is too big for the arc it's sitting on. Shame! They spent about $2 Canadian to design the coin.
I bet Robt. Bringhurst won't even carry those coins in his pocket.
As for the US dollar coin, since it's a reissue of a design from the 1920's [assuming I am thinking of the same coin you are] the letters are hand-drawn. Those were the good old days: in 1907, Teddy Roosevelt chose Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a famous American sculptor, to design some coins for the US Mint, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the coultry's coinage.
According to Wikipedia, the dollar coin was designed by medalist Anthony de Francisci, a naturalized immigrant from Italy.
Font Bureau's Grand Central has some of the flavor of public lettering of the early 20th century...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've got a $2 coin from 1996 and one from 2005 here, and both use Helvetica instead of Arial. I wonder why they switched to Arial in 2000... unless the one in the picture is counterfeit.

Forger #1 "OK, now let's see what the type is."
Forger #2 "Errr... dunno. Looks familiar tho."
Forger #1 "Maybe we should post this on the Type ID Board at Typophile."
Forger #2 "Are you freakin' <em>NUTS!?</em> They'll be on to us! They'll probably alarm the Feds or sumptin'!"
Forger #1 "OK OK Don't get your knickers in a knot. What do you propose then, smartass?"
Forger #2 "Know what, let me start up my PC. Maybe it's in the font list."
Forger #2 "Aachen? Nope. Andale Mono? Nope. Arial? ..."
Forger #1 "HOLD IT! I think that's the one! Yeah, that's it, we've got it! Rock'n'roll!"
