  body: "Looks like another old gravestone. Again not a font, but rather the stonecutter's
    idea of good lettering. \r\nThe stonecutter was probably familiar with wooden
    type grotesque typefaces such as the one revived as Times Gothic Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesGothicBoldAsDAISY_4335.gif]
    https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/times-gothic/\r\nThe _S_ has flared
    angled terminals as were found in various circa 1900 fonts such as Inland Edwards
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/inland-edwards-nf/ and Valjean http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/valjean/\r\nAgree
    with Ryuk that the _G_ is similar to Eagle.\r\nDon"
