  regularly contribute to discussion on typographic blogs and forums like [[Typographica]]
  and [[Typophile]]. \r\n\r\nFirst recorded usage 22 September 2003 by [[Grant Hutchinson]]...\r\n\"It'd
  be sorta nice to share the month of March with typorati such as Mr Goudy (March
  8th), Mr Bernhard (March 15th) and Ms Gladstone (March 19th).\"\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/1525
  \r\n\r\n\"Veer is in New York this week hanging out at [[TypeCon]] and rubbing serifs
  with the typorati.\"\r\nhttp://blog.veer.com/archives/000797.html\r\n\r\n\"For an
  interesting Friday read, try this enlightening thread where the typorati discuss
  why are we so passionate?\"\r\nhttp://blog.veer.com/archives/000942.html\r\n\r\n2.
  Typographic ephemera and collectable material\r\n\r\n\"Collectable Typorati - Nothing
