  body: "I first designed the bitmaps for the phone displays, then drew some outlines
    over these. Ole Sch\xE4fer then drew testwords for text weights which i made into
    complete alphabets, but not complete character sets. I supplied more sketches
    and weights, and Monotype then finished my rough data, interpolated the hell out
    of the fonts and delivered production data."

  body: Erik -- posting images in an already existing thread isn't yet activated in
    the new Typophile. Best option is to link to the image on another site, like your
    blog.

    Steve. I finally opened a new thread with the illustration, no pdf either. Putting
    it on my blog means writing copy, properly uploading it, etc. Too much trouble
    at times. But every week I swear to do better. Like my teachers always wrote in
    my reports: <em>Could do better.</em>. "
