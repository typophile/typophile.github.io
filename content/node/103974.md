    hand-drawn from scratch to me (and not so hard to reproduce), a perfect candidate
    for [[http://fontstruct.com|Fontstruct]]. More option for customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadrussia/red-square|Red

  body: "Well Vic, I didn't recognize this as a font off hand so I started a check
    of the usual sources. I suggest that the font was made by eroding a monoline slab
    serif like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/rockwell/fonts/\">Rockwell,
    Nexa Slab, Brix Slab, Stafford Serial, </a> or something else.\r\nThe main problem
    is an eroded font has no particular style, and when it is tagged for sale by vendors
    such as MyFonts it could be tagged as any of the following: eroded, antique, vintage,
    rough, distressed, grunge, or something else. Also many typewriter fonts receive
    a destructive treatment and some end up looking similar to _net_.\r\nSearching
    tags at MyFonts, and similar themes at dafont and elsewhere, yields quite a few
    similar fonts but nothing identical that I was aple to ID as an exact match.\r\nMagazines
    sometimes commission a font for exclusive use, and may release it for public sale
    by the designer after a period of years.  For example, Martha Stewart commissioned
    the polar opposite of this logo when it bought a severe geometric sans serif now
    sold as Benton. You can still see the font in use in the magazine logo and throughout
    the magazine. For the second time today, I can say \"it's a good thing!\"\r\nThe
    _net_ logo lettering seems not to be in use elsewhere in the magazine, which makes
    it unlikely that it is a special font.\r\nBut I have been wrong before.\r\nIn
    any event you can produce something similar from the victim font of your choice
    by various techniques. Here is a link to one: http://fontfeed.com/archives/tip-the-wornweatheredstamped-look/\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    sooner. Unfortunately maybe my post wasn't very clear because it's the not the
    font used for '.net' but the one used for 'responsive' that I was trying to detect.
    Do you think you could help me with that one too please?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nVic"

  body: "Again mcfee, I don't know if its a font or artwork. The are a number of similar
    fonts, which are commonly described as angled/angular and beveled/faceted. Google
    will pop them up for you. Allen R. Walden's Beveled of 1993 and Rick Mueller's
    Angles Octagon of 1992 are cleanly executed. I believe they are  original but
    I am not certain. So no links. Most angular/breveled are heavier in weight than
    the net magazine version and, so far, the only one I have found with a similar
    v is, <a href=\"http://www.hypefortype.com/browse-fonts/font-categories/experimental/bd-emerald.html\">BD
    Emerald</a>.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don, I don't believe that Walden did anything original - although I can't
    find the source of Beveled just now. Rick Mueller did only a few original fonts.
    Both were amongst the earliest digital revivalists.\r\n\r\nRegarding Octagon,
    see <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/octagon-french/' target='_blank'>Intellecta's
    version</a> - which includes some historical info. Jordan Davies created <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/octagon/'
    target='_blank'>a version</a> as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and these font are also known
    as prismatic, I believe. A search on that word will yield lots of such fonts.
    You don't see many narrow, modern prismatic fonts, but The Fontry offers a couple
    in its <a href='http://www.thefontry.com/racepak1b' target='_blank'>Race Pak</a>."

  body: "Thanks Mike, for the info on Walden & Mueller. As for Octagon, Herriet patented
    it on April 10, 1883 and it was sold through Connor. Marder Luse & others had
    their own versions.\r\nDon"

title: Modern chiseled font - used on cover of .net magazine? Is it custom or a typeface.
