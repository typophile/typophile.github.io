<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Dear typophiles,
for a special project I am currently looking for a contemporary [[Georgian]] (=Mkhedruli) font.
Are there any professional (maybe even screen optimized) font famlies out there, that offer different thicknesses or "caps"? Alternatively, is there any family or cut of a solid "western" font (like Helvetica, Meta, Frutiger...) that includes letters of this exotic alphabet?
Thanks in advance!
Thomas

I don't think so. Few free fonts have Georgian. The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu_fonts>DejaVu</a> fonts do; here is a picture that gives a very rough idea of their coverage

<div class=commentbody>I looked at a few <a href=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Georgian.html>Unicode Georgian fonts</a> and some may be closer to your spec but I realize that in the demo file for the XeLaTeX polyglossia package (pre release version), georgian was commented out, maybe because some appropriate font was not found.
Here is from the <a href=http://www.geocities.com/bpgfonts/files/>bpg fonts</a>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/georgian_3924.jpg]
There are also non unicode Georgian fonts around. The paratype fonts did not fit your needs?

<div class=commentbody>Hi all,
Thats very good to finally found the guys who is suppling Georgian fonts to apple. The problem is, those fonts are so so ugly and very useless. We all Georgian mac users deleting two fonts: Arial Uni and this new one Menlo because almost 10 years we using our own very nice and very beautiful fonts from Mr. Reno Siradze. He is a professional and working on macs almost 25 year.
We are almost 100 mac users and have our georgian mac community and if you all believe me, we are using fonts from Reno Siradze and many years asking apple to builtin georgian fonts in the Mac OS X but nobody cares or even listens.
Please people if you have any power or ways to contact apple, ask them favour from georgian mac users to change fonts. The best fonts with georgian keybord drive are there: http://forum.ge/?f=98&showtopic=33965267  screenshot also can find in this link.
Kind regards
David</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all,
it turned out that after some research we still didn't find any font that was working for us at all. So, loosely based on Eurostyle, and on our requirements – it had to be bold, striking and compatible with a western font – we comissioned a custom-built typeface for the client, including three weights and Italics.
It was primarily used in news graphics, channel programming and on-air menus, but soon found it's way to the website, you can see some examples here: http://www.1tv.ge
Unfortunately the font is used exclusively in-house and not out there, as far as I know.
We hired a native speaker/reader and tried our best to judge the effort, but if there are any mother-tongue readers out there, it would be interesting to hear their opinion about it!
Keeping my fingers crossed for more good fonts in that alphabet,
Thomas

<div class=commentbody>Doing a custom commission is highly commendable! But it would have been very helpful to: search for a developer* here on Typophile; and get some feedback on the progress/results before committing - I do see some problems in this design. But, again, it's very nice to see somebody who's picky enough to reject off-the-shelf stuff.
* May I ask who did the work?

<div class=commentbody>Hm. The request was, "if there are any mother-tongue readers out there, it would be interesting to hear their opinion about it". A vague "some problems" and "May I ask who did the work?" and suggestion to better "search for a developer here on Typophile" is not an appropriate answer. The right answer would have been to tell what the problems are. And why do you recommend searching for a "developer" if these are "problems in this design"?
You make me curious, especially since I see Georgian for the first time (shame on me).</div>

<div class=commentbody>1) I'm not an expert, so not the best person to give feedback. I have however made two Georgian fonts (one a "progressive" display face*, the other a run-of-the-mill text face), and as a non-native I appreciate what sorts of issues can go ignored (I was lucky to have the help of a semi-native professor at UCLA, as well as a native reader) and I see some of that here.
2) A native reader helps a lot when you're lacking a native type designer, but it's not enough by itself.
3) Most of all: it's too late. Any feedback at this point is largely academic. Certainly not a total waste, and it's nice to see a post-factum request for feedback, but I'd rather spend my own (inadequately managed) energies on things that can make a difference to a lot of people.

<div class=commentbody>As to the native speaker part, for sure. My mom is German and speaks German but better don't ask her to evaluate typefaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)

<div class=commentbody>Well, you're right there with me Hrant. Usually if the project's deadline allows it, I naturally prefer a discussion during the progress. Since my team initially didn't plan to create a custom font, we didn't have the time to develop the font with the help of expert eyes and the broader discussion as we have it here.
Given the enormously short development time, I'm really happy with the results, as is the client. But I'm sure that the font is imperfect. Meticulous analysis would be disproportionate - it's too late after all. However, if some native reader or native designer stumbles upon this discussion thread, I'd still be very interested to hear which impression it left on them.
Through a partnering company in Russia, we got in contact with Merab K. Getsadze who is the type designer. He is as far as I know Georgian or of Georgian descent.

Because it's never too late for the future! Thomas seems to be a discriminating person, so if he's ever in a similar position, hopefully he can feel more confident that we can help, and more than just by providing a casual, academic critique. Even though I think he's ahead of the game (simply because he cares), everybody can benefit from help.
