body: Hihi, I&#39;m a graphic design student from Canada and I was wondering if anyone
  else had ever come accross with the problem of bilingual forms. <BR> <BR>Recently,
  for my typographic grid class my teacher assigned us with a very horrible looking
  form from a nearby university. Basically there are two copies of this form, one
  is in english and the other one in french. Our job is to redesign this form so that
  a&#41; it&#39;s only one page and b&#41; it&#39;s much more attractive than the
  previous one. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, forms already tend to be packed with lots
  of information so it&#39;s kinda hard to keep in legible and <b>bilingual</b> on
  one page ... <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?

    problems. On your own and in your own unique way. Your assignment sounds like
    a wonderful opportunity to get your hands dirty. Why start off by asking around
    here? Go and do the job.

    trashed both. So now I&#39;m sorta &#34;stuck&#34; ... <BR> <BR>Also it doesn&#39;t
    help that each demo takes 3 hours to do ... I kind of wanted to kill my teacher
    .... &#42;very frustated&#42;

    form needs to be bilingual, assume that the reader is competent enough in one
    language to be able to sort out the meaning from a combination of languages. If
    nothing else, you&#39;ll amuse yourself and perhaps win points for lateral thinking.'

  body: 'I really don&#39;t see how Shannon is whining. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I think
    there are two possible strategies: make the two languages visually as close as
    possible; or apply some cultural sensitivity and risk the wrath of the cross-eyed
    Modernists. <BR> <BR>The first option is pretty easy. But it might result in the
    functional quicksand like in Emil Ruder&#39;s monolithic &#40;in contentually
    great&#41; textbook. <BR> <BR>The second option might benefit from using totally
    different fonts for each language. Ladislas Mandel for example insists that French
    type needs to have a smaller x-height. This would actually help in the technical
    realm too, since French will generally run longer &#40;like Nick says&#41;. You
    could also be more conservative and simply apply width &#40;friendliness versus
    elegance&#41; by using an MM font with a width axis, and making the French font
    slightly narrower, which would also help with balancing the space usage. Note
    however that smaller x-heights and narrowness will make the French have a smaller
    apparent size, and some people might interpret this as &#34;less important&#34;
    &#40;although others might see it as &#34;discrete&#34;, which fortunately happens
    to be in cultural character&#41;. One thing you could do to counter this is put
    the French first, like on the left or on top. You could also use a bit more leading
    to make it seem &#34;larger&#34; in a different way. <BR> <BR>BTW, there are some
    great articles in old issues of the journal Visible Language about multilingual
    typography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    is that generally a translation is longer than the original language. This makes
    sense as the writer, if he or she is good, will use the resources of the original

  body: Although [literal] translation adds about 10-15%, some languages are still
    more verbose than others. English is generally very terse, while Latin languages
    &#40;except Latin itself!&#41; are more verbose. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s rare to find
    good benchmarks of language economy, but a handy one is Zhukov and Sadek&#39;s
    &#34;Typographia polyglotta&#34;, which shows official, very tight, but <i>non-literal</i>
    versions of the UN Charter in 20&#43; languages. It shows that the main Latin
    languages run about 10-15% longer than English. So when you couple that to sloppy
    translation you can get a huge expansion. When Jorge de Buen translated my &#34;Improving
    the Tool&#34; essay &#40;~2,500 words&#41; into Spanish and got a gain of only
    14%, that was pretty impressive - the UN Charter is 17% longer. <BR> <BR>BTW,

    Italic. I designated the styles according to  <BR>&#34;verbosity&#34;: German

    used  <BR>for English. By keeping identical positioning of the  <BR>languages

    the original&#34; piece the teacher gave you. Which is what my teacher had told
    me. So yeah ... I was frustated, but I wasn&#39;t trying to whine. I&#39;m sorry
