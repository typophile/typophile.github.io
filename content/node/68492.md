  900px x 200px image that should quickly explain what the site is about. \r\n\r\nThis
  is what I got so far, scaled down to fit typophile's 590px width:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner-1_5840.png]\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to understand if it is clear what the intro is about. Specifically, that it
  is meant to be read from left to right as a timeline. Or should I add some visual
  aids to help guiding the viewer through the flow?\r\n"

  body: "The design in itself does not make it evident that you have to read from
    left to right, jumping zigzag up and down. You need to read and understand the
    text in order to see that. Even with the visual aids you propose the question
    would arise why the zigzag up and down, and it's a bit late here (around midnight)
    to try and think about a reason.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Thanks, Andreas. \r\n\r\nI went on assumption that an English-speaking person
    was going to scan the image from left to right, and given the content of the messages,
    it will be easy to recognize them as a sequence. It looks like I need to test
    this assumption on more people.\r\n\r\nThe reason for zigzaging is to allow for
    a larger font size without crowding things too much.\r\n"

  body: 'apankrat - I think you could reduce this to 3 concepts/steps: Record, Present,
    Prove. this could help remove the zigzag confusion folks are experiencing. It
    also simplifies the information which can help in comprehension. And it may provide
    more room for you to expand the type size.'

  body: "Thanks, guys. I appreciate the feedback.\r\n\r\nBen, what I was trying to
    do was to show how the timestamping augmented and fit into a typical creative
    process flow. It is really a smaller part of the process, and I am concerned that
    putting it front and forward may assign it too much importance, and that would
    rub people the wrong way.\r\n\r\nI do agree with you that having whole five items
    to read through might be a bit too much for an average Internet Speedy Gonzales.
    I was considering employing an animation to reduce the number of simultaneous
    on-screen items, but then the animations are harder to get right than a static
    banner."

  body: 'Yeah that is a conundrum - how to make it read just right but not lose any
    important details! Maybe the three steps should be: Create, Record, Prove. Then
    you can get into more of the details/explanations of the workflow with text content
    below the image?'

    Darrel, I will give it another go. I had a version where there was a line waving
    up and down between the words, but it looked... erm... dorky... lol. Let me just
    put a simple straight line with five notches on it. It might just work.  \r\n\r\nThe
    arrows too I tried, to me it looks unbalanced:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner-2_6549.png]"

  body: "It looks complex, which I'm sure it shouldn't. And frankly I think those
    arrows add to the confusion.\r\n\r\nScribble some alternate arrangements? I'd
    try to put it on one horizontal line, but there are many possibilities. For instance
    since you say it's a small step in the process, I'm thinking you might try making
    the type smaller, and the type for \xABconceive\xBB very large, but use color/opacity
    and the background gradient magic you have to get the visual hierarchy right,
    and shift the visual focus onto the small step that your tool focuses on."

  body: "Kim, Nina, thanks for the comments. The version with arrows was an example
    of something that I tried and that didn't quite work. I should've been more clear
    about that.\r\n\r\nHere is a version with a timeline. I think it is actually starting
    to get there. The background and gradients still need work, but my main concern
    if the implied left-to-right progression needs to be hinted in some way.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/line-r1_4986.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/line-r2_6266.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like this new approach. I also like the visual suggestion of a timeline
    - that fits well with the service. I would remove the arrows now (as I think it
    reads well now and doesn't require the visual hints), keep the timeline visual
    element, and use the brighter white "Record" text on the bottom. Try that out
    and see how it looks.

  body: "Thanks, Ben. I agree regarding the arrows to a degree. Some sort of directionality
    hint appears to be needed, few people I polled noted that the timeline reference
    is not obvious. \r\n\r\nA simple animation would work, i.e. slide in Conceive,
    Implement, Record, Release and Assert from right to left in that order and assume
    the user is paying attention. Unfortunately for this option I just don't have
    time. So I have converged to the following version and this is what I will use
    for now:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/intro-2-4c_3490.png]\r\n\r\nLarger
    version is <a href=https://www.certtime.com>here</a> if anyone's interested."

    for its own good. The biggest problem was that it needed deciphering, it expected
    site visitors to <em>think</em>... lol.\r\n\r\nIn the end I converged to something
    far more simpler (not sure if the text is legible, but basically there's just
    a simple description of the site on the left and the invitation to join the beta
    on the right).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beta-banner_6741.jpg]"
