  body: "I read it as V I design., and to me the first logo has MUCH stronger typography
    than the second one.\r\n\r\njust my 2\xA2.\r\n\r\nI assume VW are your initials?\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if maybe you would somehow make it more 'W' it would help.\r\n\r\nI mean,
    I don't want it to read as 'v v' either, but here's a direction I think you could
    possibly explore.  I wonder where it will take you if you play with it\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vw_4637.png]"
