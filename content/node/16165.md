  accepted ...\r\n\r\nI have a Photoshop .psd file that needs Geneva font ... I have
  Windows ... is there a Geneva substitue?  Without the font, I can't view the file
  in a browser and see the behaviors.  \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "There is no 'official', legal version of Geneva for PC / Windows, because
    its a MAC system font.. But, Normally if you have a PhotoShop file you can still
    open and view the image, even without actually having the fonts installed, used
    throughout the document.. <em>( You only need them if you want to change some
    of the texts within the file.. Otherwise it should open just fine.. )</em>\r\n\r\nEdit-A-Bit.:
    And, I dont really get that part of your post.: <em>'..Without the font, I can\u2019t
    view the file in a browser and see the behaviors..'</em>\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\"

  body: Is there no way to update or change the font? If it is PSD, this implies that
    their is a type layer which means you should be able to change it or flatten it
    as you open it.

    to open a browser window and see the fades and all the actions the file has ...
    or is this not an option like Dreamweaver or Fireworks ... you can preview your
    work in the browser.\r\n"
