  body: "Norbert,\r\nMy wife's sister is the pianist for the Boston Ballet.  Every
    year she moans about doing hundreds of performances of the Nutcracker. She, her
    fellow musicians, and the dancers come up with inappropriate new names for the
    ballet to amuse themselves. Most of them would not make it through the Typophile
    filter. The tamest one I can remember is \"Ball Buster\".  They are all far worse
    than your Nutc Racker poster.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I have a friend who's a dancer and she loathes this ballet, has been in it
    and complains of the same things Chris's wife's sister seems to say. I have not
    seen this in real life, but I do get sick of the same songs from it being used
    over and over again...I can only imagine what it's like to be in it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes Norbert I did read it as you read it.... :("

    Hoefler's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/charset.html\" target=\"new\">Requiem</a>
    and looks like they used the small cap \"R\" alternate with a little bit of fudging.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    no prize to give you, but it was a very good catch."

  body: I love the music but if I was a musician I could get sick of it pretty quick
    but I'd still take the pay checks. In New York the Holiday Spetacular featuring
    the Rockettes blocked the musicians union for about a week using recored music
    instead. They settled there agreement but I bet the musicians took a bath.
