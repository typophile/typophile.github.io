body: "I just installed the latest upgrade to Linotype's FontExplorer X (version 1.2.1),
  and it seems like the character map no longer shows OpenType alt characters, small
  caps, etc... am I just imagining this?\r\n\r\nI often use FontExplorer to see all
  the characters in a font, but now it seems to be only showing a basic character
  set.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nOn a related note, it seems that they added the option
  to sort by import date, which is a great idea, but also doesn't seem to work."

  body: So now Linotype should add an option to preview chosen OTL features on sample
    text. To utilize the built-in OTL support in OS X should not be a difficult task
    after all.

  body: "g\xF6kdeniz: Thanks for the tip. I have used Font Agent Pro (and a ton of
    others\u2014I did my senior graphic design BFA <a href=http://www.nicksherman.com/degreeproject/index.html
    target=_blank>project</a> on font managers and navigators, etc), but still prefer
    Font Explorer X (especially after considering FAP's $100 price tag). If you haven't
    used it yet, you should check it out.\r\n\r\nkontrapunkt: Yes that would be nice.
    They do have an auto-ligatures checkbox, which is kinda a dumbed down version
    of what you suggested. Generally, if I'm getting that detailed with character
    selection and OpenType composition, I'd just as soon use InDesign anyway. For
    now I'd be happy to get back the OpenType glyphs in the character map :)"

    I was getting tired of being asked if I wanted to install it, wish I hadn't.

    it pronto. We should all use the report feature to report the problems.

    with ... Hmmmmmm ... So I wrote back and said the problem isn't with my fonts
    as I can still access all glyphs in CS3. I told them I'm not the only one with
    the problem and pointed them toward this thread.

  body: "@Miss Tiffany - hihi.... I did the same, i.e. pointed them towards this thread
    :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, I do understand the difficulty of fixing the problem if you
    cannot reproduce it because you lack the fonts the problem occurs with. \r\n\r\nI
    had a similar problem once: a font from Monotype was acting up in a software I
    was using, and the developers of this software asked me to send them the font
    so that they could check the problem. Since the license prohibited me to do so,
    I contacted Monotype, and they were quite nice, allowing me to do so in order
    to solve the problem. Turned out that this particular font had an entry in a table
    that was perfectly okay, but which the app could not handle. The app was fixed,
    and I was happy :-))\r\n\r\nBy the way, I would recommend using www.fontexplorerx-board.com
    - great community, and especially the Mac perople are usually very helpful :-)"

    to comb through it to see if there are any similar threads there (hopefully with
    some solutions).\r\n\r\nAs far as the \"difficulty of fixing the problem if you
    cannot reproduce it because you lack the fonts the problem occurs with\"... it
    happens with ALL of my fonts. This leads me to believe very strongly that it has
    little to do with the fonts themselves and more to do with the app."

  body: "No, that does not solve the problem. If I understood correctly, the problem
    runs like this:\r\n\r\nFontExplorer X has a problem with a font. All other apps
    do not. That, naturally, does NOT mean that the problem is with FontExplorer X
    - it might nevertheless be the font - but it is likely. Nevertheless, since all
    other fonts work fine in FontExplorer X, how would these developers find out why
    their app has this problem with this particular font? Therefore, they need it
    to test it in order to find out what is REALLY going on. Sending them another
    font would only work if this font shows the exact same erroneous behaviour. \r\n\r\nBelieve
    me, have been developing software for ages. If you do not have the exact same
    settings, you cannot reproduce. It is a nightmare, and guessing is terror :-))\r\n\r\nAnd
    I guess they ask for it because, the thing being a freeware, it is the user's
    job to provide the fonts they wish FontExplorer X to work with. I think it would
    be a little too much to ask Linotype to purchase every font out there which causes
    problems. Apart from that, I personally use a lot of free fonts they would probably
    have to search for ages to find them. :-))\r\n\r\nConcerning other foundries,
    if you really want it to work, send them an email and ask them if they would agree
    to help Linotype fix the problem. Like I wrote before, Monotype was quite helpful
    concerning a similar problem once, I don't think any one would object."

  body: "Oh, I'm definitely not encouraging sending a font that is not showing the
    problem. My point was only that since the problem seems to occur with EVERY font,
    it wouldn't really matter which font you sent. Thus, sending a Linotype font might
    ease some of the licensing worries that could arise otherwise.\r\n\r\nI also agree
    that it would be too much to ask Linotype to buy every font which is having problems
    in FontExplorer X, because (in this case) that would be thousands of fonts!\r\n\r\nI
    never got a response from my own bug report, but I might suggest to others that
    Zapfino would be a good font to send back to them. The bug causes FontExplorer
    X to only show 405 characters, but (as can be seen in the Mac character palette)
    Zapfino has more like 1,460.\r\n\r\nOn another note, is there anyone out there
    who is NOT seeing this bug?\r\n"

    Technically, because it is the version that comes with Mac OS X, it still might
    be a legal lapse to send them an actual font file. I'd be surprised if Apple had
    any problems with it though.\r\n\r\nBut all this legal banter is besides the point
    anyway. Judging by the consistency of the problem across all fonts, it doesn't
    really matter which version of which font you are looking at.\r\n\r\nThe latest
    update to FontExplorer X is the one with the bug: version 1.2.1 (as noted in the
    thread name)."
