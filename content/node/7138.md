body: Hey all, <BR> <BR>I trying to determine what font Downcome started as.  Downcome
  is a destroyed free font that kind of looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/cond-bold/testdrive.html?s=MATCHBOOK+ROMANCE&amp;p=60">FF
  DIN Condensed Bold</a>, but there are some mismatches, like the point of the M does
  not reach all the way to the bottom.  Any help you guys could give, I&#39;d appreciate.  I&#39;ve
  included a sample of Downcome. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51187.png"
