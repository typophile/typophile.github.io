body: "I'm looking for a symbol that would indicate \"extra weight,\" like a scale.
  But it needs to be a font and not a graphic. I have searched the Web extensively
  and haven't found anything. Does anyone know of such a thing? Someone on another
  site told me to look at the Signs Two font, but I couldn't see anything that fit
  that description. It seems crazy that with all these dingbats out there, a scale
  is hard to find (I did find the scales of justice, but that's not what I need.)
  Any help would be appreciated.\r\n"

    into font form</a> for a small fee.

    this task? I always found the predecessor to <a href=\"http://www.redstonepress.co.uk/abz.html\">ABZ
    \u2013 More Alphabets and Other Signs</a> which was called 101 Alphabets and Other
    Signs very useful. But this is a symbolic, not typographic train of thought; further
    research for signs & symbols <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dictionaries-of-Signs-and-Symbols/lm/3KJPPE6TOZJQL/ref=cm_lm_dtpa_fvlm_cfa_1/202-2667617-3758266\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nAlternatively
    you could set +lbs or +kg (depending where you are) in any font and have done
    with it."
