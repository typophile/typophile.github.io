  I think there many things more to learn and understand. \r\n\r\nI'll be glad to
  see some good recommndations from experienced and \"in-the-know\" people. \r\n\r\nI
  must say I've got some of the books you might recommend like Bringhurst's The Element
  of Typographic style, aslo 2 books from Timothy Samara. All very good but the first
  one I still find a little bit too general and hystorical, the other ones - too shallow.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  something in-depth and very practical at the same time is what I need most.\r\nI'm
  not interested in books or some kind of artsy typo posters which is often subject
  of such books.  I'm doing brochures, a short magazine, leaflets etc. \r\nHowever
  I'll find very interesting something more sophisticated dealing with the letters'
  elements and structure, fonts design - not that I'll start creating my own fonts,
  just quite interested how it's made \r\n\r\nthanks"

    great follow-up to the usual stuff we all read. Actually, the probably would have
    been better starters than a lot of the stuff I read as a sophomore that just confused
    me with variations on Vox classification and the details of different kinds of
    punctuation (which should be the job of the editors, not the damned designers!)."
