		<div class="commentbody"><p>Zeno, your taste in blackletter, at least as so far indicated in your posts here, seems solidly confined to Victorian display types. I suppose these have a particular charm of their own, and certainly evoke particular periods and styles of typography very well, but I wonder how deeply you have explored other and older branches of the blackletter family tree? There are, for example, whole styles of blackletter that were developed for continuous text and that more fully integrate straight and round forms, making for less stiffness.</p>
<p>And then there is this, which not many people have seen: the fraktur symbol glyphs from my Brill types, which I commissioned Karsten Luecke to design. This is not a fully functioning fraktur font, as the glyphs are encoded as math alphanumerics and spaced as symbols for use with roman text in <em>apparatus critici,</em> but I think it is a very fine design that I hope Karsten will complete and release as stand-alone fonts. It harmonises extremely well with the Brill roman, on account of mirroring the swelled stroke constuction, which is unusual in blackletter types although found in 18th Century German scribal exemplars.

Not readable… to whom? It is sure readable to me, and I am not German. In his <em><a href="http://bibliopolis.ch/xorista.php?nr=120503">Über Schönheit von Schrift und Druck</a>. Erfahrungen aus fünfzigjähriger Arbeit</em> (Frankfurt a.M.: Georg Schauer Verlag, 1949) Karl Klingspor makes a fairly convincing case for the superiority of <em>Fraktursatz</em> over <em>Antiqua-Typographie</em>. Incidentally, look how very<a href="http://www.oreos.de/lachenmann/Fraktur01.gif"> readable</a> the text of the book is. And speaking of the current designs. Is <a href="http://www.teff.nl/fonts/burgundica/pdf/burgundica_a3_print-600.pdf">Burgundica</a> easy enough for you?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, you seem in danger of arguing against yourself, since what readers find legible &lsquo;these days&rsquo; is a matter of familiarity, and if not necessarily of reading best what they read most, of reading well what they have learned to read. In my experience, learning to recognise the letters of a particular style in a writing system that you already know is one of the easiest of things. I don&rsquo;t think this is any kind of professional advantage that a &lsquo;layman&rsquo; lacks, but is rather a core human ability that we have harnessed to the purpose of reading for a very, very long time. True illegibility is only found when there is no consistency within the style.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, it&rsquo;s certainly possible to learn variant (and even totally new) structures - as you imply I&rsquo;m a big fan of that sort of thing. However it has to be done subtly/gradually and with intent - you can&rsquo;t throw a classical blackletter at a general readership and say &ldquo;deal with it&rdquo;. The good news is that the real value of blackletter doesn&rsquo;t depend on a handful of archaic structures.</p>
<blockquote>True illegibility is only found when there is no consistency within the style.</blockquote>
<p>To me that&rsquo;s <em>unreadability</em>. In the terminology I use (which is pretty widespread) illegibility arises when an individual symbol is closer to some familiar character than it is to what it&rsquo;s supposed to be (or so far from the intended character that it&rsquo;s hopeless). For example the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rdquo; in Brill will be confused for &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;G&rdquo; respectively; probably not by people for whom the font was designed, but people in general. This idea is of course not my invention - it&rsquo;s presented quite explicitly in Bain &amp; Shaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blackletter: Type and National Identity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Confusability &ndash; when one letter is easily mistaken for another &ndash; is only one form of illegibility, and I doubt if many people would consider it the most obvious. The other form of illegibility is simply inability to identify the signs at all, and my point is that this occurs if the forms are inconsistent within a style such that the style cannot be learned. As long as letterforms are consistent, it is remarkably easy to learn to read a new style of writing or typography within a familiar script system; this is even the case where the system itself permits of what I would call consistent variation, e.g. Arabic. People do this to one degree or another all the time, often without even realising that they are learning something new (and notoriously, sometimes without even being conscious of the differences, as in the case of people who&rsquo;d never noticed &lsquo;the little feet&rsquo;).</p>
<p><em>&hellip;you can&rsquo;t throw a classical blackletter at a general readership and say &ldquo;deal with it&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I think this is a matter of will rather than ability. It isn&rsquo;t that general readers couldn&rsquo;t easily figure out the identities of the letters and become proficient in reading the style in short order, but that their reading experience had been shaped by a fairly narrow set of styles and they are not used to being asked to learn new things in the sphere of reading, so are likely to be unwilling to try. But in the area of text typography, I think this is almost as true for the kind of new blackletter you promote as for any of the traditional styles. If you set a book or a magazine in Fraktoer, the likelihood of a general readership accepting it, buying it and reading it seems to me about the same as if you set it in the Brill fraktur. This has nothing to do with readability, but only with convention and perceived effort.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, thanks for the Tulpe Fraktur link. Yes, it is consistent in the sense I meant, i.e. the form of each occurrence of a letter is easily identifiable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a display type, of course, and exhibits all sorts of things that are inconsistent with fraktur-proper, which is a particular historical text style of blackletter characterised by certain normative constructions and consistent variations. But that isn&rsquo;t the sense in which I used the term &lsquo;consistent&rsquo; in my exchange with Hrant.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>

<p>Accepting/buying it, possibly&hellip; unless they read some of it first, because: there&rsquo;s no way a font with unfamiliar <em>structures</em> (not the same thing as style) can be as efficient - some people will stop reading, and of those who do go through the trouble some will not appreciate having to make the extra effort (consciously or unconsciously). Fortunately as you wrote that&rsquo;s not what Brill&rsquo;s blackletter is for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok. Just to throw the proverbial spanner in the works. Although black letter would not be my favourite script, I can see the attraction in black letter as a pen-written script, but black letter as a typeface is always a failure for me.</p>
<p>Look at Gutenburg&rsquo;s black letter and there is clear evidence of it&rsquo;s pen-written origins. Having practised and studied calligraphy a little, I was always taught that, in black letter, the vertical spaces between the strokes should be visually equal to the strokes themselves; it is this basic vertical rhythm that gives it its name and its strength, its very blackness in fact.</p>
<p>I have yet to see (could be famous last words here I fear, but that&rsquo;s ok) a typeface that demonstrates this rhythm and pattern successfully. The fraktur example above almost gets there in the bold variant, but still, like all the rest, just fails for me; sorry John.</p>
<p>My absolute pet-hate in this area is the (usually) home-made signs, tee-shirts etc. using black letter, all caps. I feel I want to grab the offending person by the collar and shout in their face &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Can&rsquo;t you see it just doesn&rsquo;t work? Can&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s just UGLY?&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t because many of them are bikers and a lot bigger than me so I just let cowardice be the better part of valour.</p>
<p>Is there a black letter typeface that is true to the scripts origins?</p>

<p>This is typical of the textura style, but not of fraktur or other later blackletter styles that involve rounded forms and greater variation in letter width. It should also be noted that the term &lsquo;blackletter&rsquo; does not always imply blackness or heaviness, only that the styles in this category are related in their develoment to styles such as textura and rotunda in which blackness was a feature. There are numerous remarkably light fraktur styles, in both written and engraved exemplars as well as type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I just came across this old thread when it was revived yesterday.
Here are a few observations on aspects not raised in the discussion.
Fraktur &ndash; the most common typeface for books printed in blackletter before WWII &ndash; was incomprehensible to me when I started to learn it in 1990. Most of the lowercase was understandable although a few letters like <em>k</em> and <em>x</em> were a challenge. However much of the uppercase was impossible. It took months before I could confidently tell the difference between letters like <em>V</em> and <em>B</em>. As for the circularized <em>K</em> and broken backed <em>H</em>&hellip; I have no doubt that my experience is typical of the few people who have attempted to learn how to read Fraktur in recent decades.
For over a century type designers have reformulated blackletter to make it legible without a special course of instruction. Some of the best efforts were done before WW I, notably by people like Behrens &amp; Koch. 
The expressiveness of blackletter is a strong motivation for continued attempts to bridge the legibility gap.
I do notice a resurgence of blackletter in the most unexpected places. For many years non-German readers accepted blackletter in the context of religious texts. Then came rock music, particularly the heavy metal genre. Bikers. Tatoo aficionados. Today blackletter simplified Old English  is the signature of a Los Angeles street scene clothing created by a Latino company <em>Born + Raised</em>. Blackletter as the means of protest against the Man. Go figure!
