  for a client whose standard typefaces are Scala and Scala Sans (which don't support
  Cyrillic characters). At the moment it's looking like I'm going to have to make
  a list of all of the humanist faces and then check which have the necessary glyph
  support -- not an especially appealing prospect!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a suggestion
  of a better way to carry out my search -- or possibly even firsthand knowledge of
  a suitable font?"
