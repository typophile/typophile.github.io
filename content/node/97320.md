  if the page has a colored background,  the color shows in the center of the box.
  If I prefer that the center of the box be white I have to use an awkward workaround
  like pasting the box in place as an inline graphic (I'm using InDesign).\r\n\r\nIs
  there such a thing as a font in which the checkbox's center is white and knocks
  out the background?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkbox_4809.jpg]"

  body: In Arial, you can find two squares (Unicode 25A0 and 25A1). Choose them and
    color the first one white; set kerning to -600. Voila! Of course, you can add
    black stroke to make the shape look as you want.

  body: Use the solid square from Zapf Dingbats (or other square of your choice),
    set it to white, then apply a black stroke of your desired thickness. No messing
    about with kerning required!

  body: Don't use the kerning thing, it's a clunky solution. Simpler is better.

    all the suggestions but the single-square one sounds like the best method.\r\n"

  body: Then, of course, you make it a GREP style so that every time you type a box
    it automatically gets colored and stroked.

  body: And a two-colour vector image is a dumb solution?

  body: 'The problem with vector images is that normally in InDesign they don''t reflow
    if the text changes. If you''ve got an order form with 30 checkboxes as images
    and the leading changes, you''ve got to manually go back and reposition each one.  A
    workaround is to paste each image into the text as an inline image, and then it''ll
    reflow, but I''ve always found inline images to be tricky to work with, so if
    there''s a way to insert a checkbox as regular text it''s what I''d prefer to
    do. '

  body: The font [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/symbojet/regular/glyphs.html|Symbojet]]
    comes with some combining full-shape glyphs with a zero-width, made to fit exactly
    to the purpose you describe, in connection to other (frame-like) glyphs.

  body: "It's always best to do as much as possible natively in InDesign, so Joshua's
    GREP style suggestion above is a great one.\r\n\r\nAs long as you use a dingbats
    font common to Mac and PC there's no reason to start obtaining other fonts specifically
    for this. Which isn't good news for those selling fonts but your life will be
    considerably easier.\r\n\r\nI'm harping on about this I know, but you don't get
    any points for choosing more complex solutions, the reader just sees the box."
