  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I don&#39;t usually post this early in my project, but I&#39;ve got a serious issue that I need some help on. This is one for you intellectuals and ultra-business-minded communicators. <BR> <BR>I am struggling to even come up with a concept for my client because of the nature of his business direction &#40;which we need not spend time debating here&#41;. He has decided to make a career alteration which will include returning to practicing law &#40;mostly estate planning type stuff&#41; and real estate brokering. In my experience developing solutions for both of these types of professionals, I have discovered many dynamics that are unique to each type. I am not successfully thinking of a concept that will satisfy both. <BR> <BR>I know that there are some great minds out there, so I&#39;m hoping that some of you might have some stellar ideas on how to merge a legal practice and a real estate brokerage into one identity. Before I share any of my current considerations &#40;which are weak&#41; I will wait to hear your untainted response&#40;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan and Chris: <BR> <BR>I both hoped and expected to see posts from you. Thank you for the &#34;counsel&#34; &#40;this job has put me in lawer mode&#41;. After abandoning an ambulance as an image, I developed some directions that are somewhat in line with what you&#39;ve both suggested. I will create a primarily typographical logo which will probably, but not necessarily have some associated imagery that leans more toward the lawerly side. <BR> <BR>I spent a lot of time brainstorming to come up with an image, voice and communicated purpose for The Law Office of Gary Saunders. After a couple of hours of scribbling notes and sketches, I found a couple of directions that successfully merge these two business interests &#40;law / real estate&#41;. The first direction, and the one that I favor, focuses on &#34;commitment&#34; &#40;contracts, pen, ink, paper, etc.&#41;, with a visual emphasis on people and reliability. The second approach also focuses on &#34;agreement&#34;, with a visual emphasis on handshakes and good old fashioned trust. I prefer the first, because it is serious and believable and the visuals I am coming up with are lawerly; while the second seems like it could be perceived as too old fashioned &#40;handshakes are no longer trusted&#41; and clich</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, just make sure that the gold stamping is compadible with their lazer printers or you might have a problem. Also Scott you know you are making custom envelopes for this project. To achieve that effect they have to be printed then converted. Its more expensive and takes longer to get done. As long as the client is okay with that its a moot point. Are you going to print that color on the envelope &#40;Background&#41; or is it a stock color from a paper swatch.

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, nice work! &#40;I fell off the radar for a bit, so this is the first I&#39;m seeing of it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I agree with Tom and John, I like everything but the pen. Part of it is the fade on the pen. It makes it look like pre-fab stationary to me. For a law firm, I envision a crisp image, with defined edges. Essentially, I see it as grey &amp; fuzzy vs. sharp &amp; clean, and the latter wins. <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;m not anti-pen, but I&#39;m not feeling the execution. As it is, I think it&#39;d be stronger without than with. The fountain pen is a good choice for a law firm, so I&#39;d develop that. Perhaps make the body of the pen glossy, so you have reflections to work with in the mark to make it end cleanly? Not sure. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s definitely interesting that the firm wanted such a visually active stationary set, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprise if law firms start to open up their visual identities a bit, as the twentysomethings of today become the partners of tomorrow. Again, Scott, nice work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My opinion: &#40;for what it is worth&#41; <BR>If possibly to not use the pen, you are better off. <BR>It just seems to disctract and cheapen the image. <BR>It is so much stronger with out it. If the client has a gun to your head &#40;ie: his money, his project, his choice&#41; then go with the more illustrative pen. The more photographic, the cheaper it looks. <BR> <BR>Hildebant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It just looks like STOCK PHOTOGRAPHY. It feels that it brings down the rest of your work. I suggest using just type. <BR> <BR>&#34;Obviously, generic iconography, in and of itself, means different things to different people.&#34; <BR> <BR>The goal of an icon is to have recognition visually as to what you do. I am not saying that all icons are immediately recognized, but I feel that the pen is a mixed message. I don&#39;t think on every job there has to be an icon, especially if there isn&#39;t one that fits.  <BR> <BR>I know some of you argue that there is type that will be with the icon. But that backs up what many on here are saying- why have an icon at all. Why force something to work when it doesn&#39;t, especially when you have a classy clean type solution already. The pen will draw attention away from the foil stamp. <BR> <BR>Even with the pen, your work looks good as always Scott. Have a good weekend.</div>
