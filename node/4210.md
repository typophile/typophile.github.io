  body: Starting at MyFonts&#39; page for Torino, I found out that it was designed
    in 1908 for the <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/nebiolo/" TARGET="_top">Nebiolo
    foundry</A> in Turin, Italy &#40;in Italy the town is called Torino&#41; by Alessandro
    Butti, who later went on to design Eurostile with Aldo Novarese &#40;with a major
    step in between&#41;. I couldn&#39;t find much else in the way of useful information,
    save that Bitstream designed an equivalent in the form of Industrial 736. Hope
    this helps.

    established in the late 1800s. Type design started in the 1930s, first under the
    direction of painter Giulio da Milano, then from 1936 under Alessandro Butti,
    and from 1952 under the guidance of Aldo Novarese. It was Italy&#39;s premier
    foundry of the 20th century. It closed its typography department in 1975. Their
    most famous font families include Eurostile &#40;1962&#41;, Microgramma &#40;1952&#41;,
    Torino &#40;1908&#41; and Stop &#40;1971&#41;. <BR> <BR><B>Alessandro Butti</B>
