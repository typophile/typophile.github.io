  body: "Perhaps our typophiles are stumped because the logo is extensively edited.
    About all I can offer are a couple of thoughts on origin of the base font.\r\nThis
    is a thickened version of measured designs that can trace their lineage to Trafton,
    designed by Howard Trafton and cast by Bauer in1933; Coronet designed by R. H.
    Middleton for Ludlow in  1937; and Stylescript designed by Sol Hess in 1940 for
    the Lanston Monotype Company. Harold's Fonts has digitized Stylescrpt as <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/families/swizzle-script/styles/regular/?code=identifont\">Swizzle
    Script</a>. The logo in Swizzle Script:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SwizzleScript_4532.jpg]\r\nDon"
