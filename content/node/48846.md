  body: 'One word of caution to anyone using this font in print: Because of its very
    small relative size the dots are rendered by FontStruct as diagonal lumpy cardioids,
    instead of circles. Because the problems associated with relative size are a "<a
    href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/faq/fonts/why_do_i_have_to_use_such_a_huge_point_size">known
    issue</a>" we may be able to assume that the rendering will get better over time.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture6_4377.png]'

  body: You're welcome. I also recently realized you can drag a shape from the lower
    shape palette on top of the "used shapes" above and batch convert them. Make all
    your dots hexagons, etc. I played around with this with Pullchain a bit, but didn't
    find anything that worked better than your circles.
