  body: Unless you are looking for some sort of novelty font (like one with icycles
    hanging off of it) the font, itself, doesn't usually have that literal of a meaning.
    It's more to do with how you use it than the specific typeface.

    body: "Yeah, I don't want anything lame like icicles.  I'm making a logotype for
      a freezer company.  They just have a warehouse where they freeze things for
      people.  They wanted to advocate that they did things quickly, hence why I wanted
      a typeface that advocated frost and speed.\r\n\r\nI'm still not really sure
      what I want to do for the logo type. Any of the obvious stuff is taken by competitors.
      \ In fact, all of their competitors are some shade of blue, from teal to like
      navy blue.  They mentioned that they wanted some kind of stainless steel look,
      but even their largest competitors is already doing that.  So my main focus
      was to do something very different and unique for them.  Something to really
      set them apart from the rest of the competition.\r\n\r\nSome of their competitors
      use snow on top of the letters and it looks really, really gay.  Others have
      like snowmans and stuff.  It's just so unprofessional and ugly looking.\r\n\r\nPretty
      much the best competitor is this site:\r\nhttp://www.versacold.com/template.asp?pageID=5#warehouseserv"

    which could both hint at the idea of an ice cube or rather carved into ice?"

    ;o)\r\n\r\nAgain I don't think you'll find a specific typeface that 'says' fast
    or cold. In fact, I'm not sure if the logotype even needs to 'say' that. It really
    is just a mark to represent the company. The marketing and branding of the company
    should say that, with the logotype simply being the mark used to label all of
    that.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Creating a <cite>freezing quick</cite> logo using a typeface alone might
    not do it. What I mean is, there may be something potentially interesting in the
    actual letters used in spelling whatever the word or name is.\r\n\r\nWhen I create
    a logo I look at specific characters within what's being spelled, be it a word
    or initials. When you create a memorable and recognizable logo, you sometimes
    rely on the uniqueness of individual characters and not the whole typeface.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    replacing or modifying one of the characters makes it sing.\r\nMaybe instead of
    trying to look freezing it could look ultra futuristic giving it a super high-tech
    feel. Being literal is not always creative.\r\n\r\nJust for a trial reaction,
    spell the name out using the EPCOTT or DECOTECH fonts available on the Disney
    Experience site: http://www.disneyexperience.com/fonts.htm\r\n\r\nor SPACE AGE

  body: As well as the two previous suggestions, picking something somewhat angular
    could work well as it might speak to the crystaline nature of ice without having
    to be incredibly literal (icicles etc). i can't think of any examples however..

  body: "Ahh, cool.  I guess I never thought of that.  However, Windsor is still pretty
    generic and others probably have used that wind effect in the title (it's still
    an average size city).\r\n\r\nThey also wanted to convey \"clean\", \"fresh\"
    and maybe incorporate stainless steel (not my recommendation since competitors
    do it), blue water and \"white\"\r\n\r\nThey also suggested using an iceberg cracking
    into a sheet of ice water, but I'm not skilled enough to draw something like that,
    even if it just a simple 2-color line drawing in Macromedia Freehand.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you mean exactly by swashes and 'scenders?  I don't really know what you mean
    by that.  I'll play with your suggestions and see what I come up with.  Thanks!"

  body: Maybe an industrial font - Something chunky - or even a boldish UNIVERS -
    combined with a snowfake would work nicely. The rough & tough against the delicate.
    Then it could be a one color design - white knoock out text with a blue flake.
    my 2 cents.

    Not sure what you might find that seems cold enough, though. Upon reflection,
    your client probably wouldn't like my idea anyway.\r\n\r\nHow about Handel?"

    snowflake with Chunky type might be just the kind of sick predictable hybrid logo
    they LOVE. On the other hand it could be awesome in a designers republic sort
    of way.

  body: "Well, unfortunately speaking from experience, it is difficult to take the
    high road on things like this. That being said, there is a different aesthetic
    maybe to look for.\r\n\r\nIce can be delicate like a flake or hard and blocky.
    Some of the type suggested hits that blocky note. I know an ital Serpentine bold
    can work like that, but haven't we all seen enough of that. Solid and cold and
    fast maybe?\r\n\r\nAlso Officina Serif bold ital with some illustrative exageration
    can do what you need."

  body: how about http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/platthand/ ? A little work
    in illustrator and it can be made to look like lines and swirls in ice, for clarity
    you'd need to adjust the swashes and make the word itself appear darker. The for
    that industrial look something blocky with back turing serifs ... can't think
    of an example... totally different and should convey the concept.

    another photo. Frost can be incredibly varied in look and sometimes quite beautiful.
    If you have swash caps, the ends might turn into frost - like frozone! Sometimes
    the most obvious is best, if well executed. Another way is to have Windsor solid
    and Freezer outlined with the frost inside, in a fat face like FF Trademarker
    fat. \r\n\r\nI don't know, they may look awful, or great. You could try. "
