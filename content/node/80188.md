  start some of the characters in Ilustrator. I only have 7 characters to show you
  at this time. I'd like to know if anyone thinks its too similar to an existing font?\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys!\r\n\r\n"

    keep glyphing!\r\n\r\nAny idea on the licencing, yet?"

  body: "@Frank: I suppose Minion looks more like Times than this glyphs look like
    Sassoon... :)\r\n\r\n@nhood: Very nice, although /a/ will need a spur/terminal/tail
    to distinguish it from /o/. But otherwise these letters are very promising. Keep
    on drawing. But don't draw them too geometrically (look at /b/ for instance) but
    rather visually. /c/ for instance is pointing upwards even thou the top of it
    is probably geometrically level."

    exactly what that means for fonts. Do you mind giving me a summary of font licencing?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    top of the 'c' and 'b' down slightly?"

  body: "@nhood: Yes /c/ definitely because the stroke ends \"in the air\". /db/ don't
    have this issue (at least not to this extent.\r\n\r\n/b/ has the other issue where
    the curve touches the straight line. It doesn't look smooth but rather looks as
    if it had an edge. The same is true for /ad/ but it's not that obvious (at least
    to me)."

  body: "Don't start with \u201Cabcde\u201D. You're just playing with variations on
    one simple form of letter and not really pushing into a typeface. Move on to H,O,h,
    and o. Then move on to test words like SHOPS and hoggles. After that work on HANGLOVES/handgloves
    to fill out your basic forms. Once you finish that it's time to flesh out the
    alphabet."

  body: "@nhood : for fonts, licencing means defining area of uses for your typeface
    ; unless you target branding market, your licence should be as permissive as possible,
    because then your typeface is meant to convoy information and as you know information
    is everywhere, in print, in website, withing e-books, and people need typeface
    which allow embedding and great freedom of use (except of use, claiming the design
    as their own, and sell the typeface at your expense).\r\nmost typefaces are under
    restrictive licences for paranoid and/or outdated conception of what a typeface
    is supposed to be. \r\nBut with open source, Google Fonts & allii shouting around,
    type industry is shifting around. As a challenger, your advantage is be proactive
    relative to this aspect.\r\nSee linked file below (licencing policy compared across
    +40 type foundries, sorry, it's in French) :\r\nhttp://www.fadebiaye.com/type/comparatif_licences.pdf"

  body: "hi nhood, it's quite simple in fact. \r\n\r\n1. is it for branding or for
    text ? both is making things trickier\r\n\r\n2. if for branding, control-freak
    copyright and at best, sell it as an exclusive corporate typeface\r\n\r\n3. if
    for text, prepaid copyleft ; set a souscription and then release it under OFL
    licence ; do not run after piracy, it's a waste of time and money ; be sure to
    determine how much you want to earn, be paid and then release the tiger!\r\n\r\nMore

    selling it. I suppose i shouldn't concern myself with licensing until i'm finished."

  body: "Exclusivity can be one of the conditions of a special End User License Agreement.
    A client (in this case, usually a corporation that commissioned a custom typeface
    for their own branding use) may wish to acquire the exclusive right to use your
    font, thus denying your right to sell it to anyone else, either in perpetuity,
    or for a specified limited time, or conditional on other circumstances; in exchange
    for a substantial additional fee. Exclusivity can multiply the sale price of a
    font license many times above your usual retail price, since it would have to
    compensate you for all projected sales if you were able to sell it normally.\r\n\r\nBut
    that's more a question for the Release forum."
