  body: "There are several freeware blackletters that are a pretty close match for
    this. Take a look at [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Portcullion|Portcullion]]
    by Paul Lloyd at Font Squirrel, or Dieter Steffman's [[http://www.fontspace.com/dieter-steffmann/blackletter|Blackletter]]
    at the less reputable fontspace.com. For a commercial variant there is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/black-rose/|Black
    Rose]] by Michael Hagemann via myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nAny of these could be easily
    tweaked to match your sample pretty closely."

title: I have a customer switching screen printers.  All he has is this sample of
  the font and I need to identify it.
