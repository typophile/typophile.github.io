  text in a modern (as in contemporary, not as in Romantic) face? Would you see this
  as an unforgivable act of heresy?\r\n\r\nFor instance, suppose someone commissioned
  you to design a \"modern-looking\" edition of <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>.
  Some would argue that this text, originally published in 1865, should be set in
  an English (or at least British) face of about the same time. Among the more familiar
  faces, you would have Bell, Baskerville and Bulmer -- even though I believe they're
  all from the 1700s, not the 1800s.\r\n\r\nWould you consider \"modernizing\" Carroll's
  classic -- or any other classic -- through design a ludicrous proposition? If not,
  what would be your approach?"

    in on the original question: I don''t think typefaces have to come from the same
    time period or locale as where the text originated. I think the most important
    consideration is that the typeface "honors" the text. What would be really interesting
    to me (but maybe this is too Wizard of Oz) would be to have a more conservative
    typeface for Alice in the real world and something a bit more weird for when she
    crosses over into Wonderland. I would love to see Alice in a more impressionistic
    type, maybe something like <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=43">Serapion</a>
    or <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=11">Biblon</a>.'

      who are typophiles using period type would probably be lost on the reading audience.</code>\r\n\r\nAh...
      We were discussing something very similar over in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27323\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>About Minion</em></a>.\r\n\r\nI would go one step further
      and say, at the risk of being stoned to death right here, that most signs of
      typographic refinement are completely lost on the reading audience.\r\n\r\nI'm
      not suggesting we all just give up and start using nothing but Times New Roman.
      However, if we're going to be realistic, I think the cold truth is that the
      overwhelming majority of readers won't see anything wrong with The Hound of
      the Baskervilles set in a 17th-century French face.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my point
      is that there would be little or no room for typographic refinement if our only
      concern were those things that actually affect the majority of readers. (Determining
      what does affect readers would in turn require extensive research, which is
      even further off topic.)\r\n\r\nI quite like the idea of two different faces
      for AIW, with a wacky one for Wonderland.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>I think the most
      important consideration is that the typeface \"honors\" the text.</code>\r\n\r\nI
      completely agree, Paul. But I suspect that a typographer's concern with honouring
      content isn't always compatible with a publisher's idea of how a book should
      be \"packaged\" so that it cost as little as possible to produce and sell as
      much as possible."

    -- the first classic that crossed my mind -- but have since been intrigued by
    the idea of doing it as an exercise. Both the text and Tenniel's illustrations
    are in the public domain, so the financial investment would be minimal.\r\n\r\nSince
    I don't want to invest in new faces for this experimental project, I've been considering
    either Quadraat (pretty \"whimsical\", I would say) or Esprit, but wonder if the
    latter would be really suitable for a book -- or at least most of it, if I use
    a face for the real world and another for wonderland. Also, perhaps Esprit is
    too rococo for the text. (I tried asking about the use of Esprit for extended
    text in another topic but didn't get any replies, so I'm removing it.)\r\n\r\nRe.
    Tenniel's illustrations, as a child I used to find them rather spooky. Granted,
    AIW is hardly a book for modern children -- too long, for one thing. Still, in
    order to make the illustrations slightly less scary, I was thinking of perhaps
    \"illustratoring\" them a little to make them look more like paintings. Would
    that be an unforgivable desecration of Tenniel's work?"

  body: "i can hardly believe that any believe can stop the wheels of time.\r\nmodernizing
    is a question of quality. \r\n\r\nhow ever, modernizing can be a fade, a passing
    fashion. \r\ndid you happen to visit flee markets and see books from the 50's?
    sometimes are designed in a \"modern\" way,with a modern pattern and set in modern
    typography. and then it says \"shakespeare - macbeth\". and you just don't buy
    it (metaphorically speaking). however you may find designs that try to bridge
    past and present, using elements of both sides, trying to connect an old painting
    for the cover, with the inner book set in a clean design and typeface. that's
    just a free example. \r\n\r\nif the designer works on a story, it's his chance
    of making the piece good or bad. screaming \"herasy\" and burning eretics never
    made such donation to the world's benefit and progress. when you try something
    new, it's abet, not always you can succeed. we learn from mistakes and success.\r\nif
    someone would want to design a classic in a modern way, it has to be in a way
    that reflects the old spirit in it. shakespeare cannot really live and thrive
    inside an SMS. but there is a possibilty. i don't know how.\r\n\r\nalso i think
    that a traditional way should be made and exist along with the new way, so i can
    choose one of them.\r\n\r\npersonally, i like the traditional way. if i were to
    read alice for example in (exaggerate just to emphasise) a face like helvetica
    or futura, with a book that's designed using clean and modern design, i would
    lose something of that old feeling. old design goes through a process: first it's
    welcomed. then it's obsolete. then it's appreciated by those who can appreciate.
    i would give my boy in the future a book that preserves that feeling. i would
    five him a book that looks sort of 19th century, with the original illustrations.\r\n\r\nif
    they could sell something lik, err, harry potter (with a reasonable price) in
    a leather-bound book with all sorts of designs that link to the book design of
    the 19th century, they would do that. i gave this example for something that tries
    to look \"old\".\r\n\r\nit's that feel that accompanies old things that gives
    them the interest. that feel makes harry potter so designed and profitable. harry
    potter shows this tendancy to desire for the old and nostalgic, to enjoy it like
    an old wine."
