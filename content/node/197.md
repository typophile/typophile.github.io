  body: Just curious --- what is the difference between  <BR>Neue Helvetica &amp;
    Helvetica. This is the info at linotype <BR> <BR>&#34;Over the years, Helvetica
    was expanded to include many different weights, but these were not coordinated
    with each other.In 1983, D. Stempel AG redesigned and digitized the &#34;Neue
    Helvetica&#34; typeface for Linotype and made it a self-contained font family.
    Today, this family consists of 51 different font weights.&#34; <BR> <BR>Just curious
    why there is a nearly $250.00 price difference between the two packages.............
