  body: "Sorry, the text is too small and low res to positively ID (the letters need
    to be at least 100 px tall and a decent resolution to run through visual database
    search). The |J| is pretty distinctive (first line), and resembles Life (released
    in 1965):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/life/\r\n\r\nAnd you\u2019re
    right, Nimbus is close, but not quite. In fact, it\u2019s from the wrong era (1980s),
    and is actually just a clone of Times New Roman (but it was the closest hit on
    database searches). Given that your sample is from 1974, we\u2019re dealing with
    a metal or phototypesetting version of Times Bold Condensed that may have been
    distinctive to the European market. And that might never have been digitized.\r\n\r\nYou
    can find a similar |f| in Madison Antiqua (originally release in 1965) and its
    Bitstream version, Century 725, and in Romana:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madison-antiqua/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-725/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/romana/"

    to match fairly closely. Perhaps the Intertype version?"

  body: "Concorde is a good suggestion (great for the |f|), but it was released in
    1975 and the sample dates from 1974 (though that could only apply to the content,
    not the design or printing).\r\n\r\nDo you think the |t| in Concorde matches the
    sample? I thought where it connects to the crossbar was a fairly straight line
    on the sample, but I can\u2019t be sure...."

  body: The Encyclopaedia of Typefaces says Concorde was released in 1968. I think
    it was Concorde Nova that was released in 1975.

  body: "Good observation! The headline looks more like Times bold, but with that
    squashed \u2018f\u2019. Could there have been a cut of Times like that \u2013
    maybe for machine composition?\r\n\r\nAs observed <a href=\"https://medium.com/@adambanksdotcom/legos-letter-to-parents-and-how-not-to-tell-a-fake-when-you-dont-see-one-2ca9dfe586d7#7c13-10636e144c4b\">by
    Adam Banks elsewhere</a>, the body text doesn\u2019t seem to quite perfectly match
    the digital version of Concorde either. Anyone have a \u201970s specimen book
    for Berthold or Intertype?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the entire booklet (sadly at the
    same resolution) <a href=\"http://www.redshift.com/~shifflett/lego/German_catalog_1974/index.html\">has
    been scanned here</a>."

    from an Intertype specimen book showing Times Roman with Bold .\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0127_6629.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
    best guess for the body text is Intertype Concorde, but I haven\u2019t found a
    specimen of it so I can\u2019t confirm that."

    specimen? (I\u2019m assembling PDFs/scans of as many type specimens as I can get
    my hands on, but phototypesetting specimens have been harder to come by than older
    metal type specimens).\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this thread; I\u2019ve learned
    a great deal...."

  body: "The counter on the lowercase \"e\" is smaller than in Concorde (at least
    Dutch 809, supposed to be an imitation of Pilgrim and/or Concorde) but the weight
    of the typeface seems heavier than that of Life.\r\n\r\nAh, this is partly a pixel
    problem; Life seems to be a possible match, but the difference in the counters
    of the \"e\" between the two faces is less than I thought.\r\n\r\nThere is a special
    German version of Times Roman with somewhat lighter capitals, but it doesn't have
    a special J.\r\n\r\nLooking on Identifont, I encountered [[http://www.identifont.com/show?GII|Le
    Monde Livre]] which, although similar, does not seem to be a match. Also, Pilgrim
    as shown there is definitely not the same as either Dutch 809 or Concorde, and
    is not eligible for consideration (the J is quite different).\r\n\r\nBut the differences
    between Life BT, which is what I had, and EF Life and URW Life are sufficient
    that the face probably is one form of Life.\r\n\r\nEDIT: However, of the four
    forms of Life shown on Identifont, none of them have the pot-hook f characteristic
    of metal type under circumstances where absolutely no kerning is possible."
