<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I know I've learned a lot asking questions and surfing this site. Has anyone thought of helping to elevate the knowlege of DTP font junkies who don't know what they're downloading. My thought is to have someone that really knows what they are talking about take 1 or 2 of those free/shareware fonts per week and let those of us that can't see the little bump on the diagonal stroke of a K what's good or bad about that font. <br> <br>Of, course, I would recommend using the ones that weren't obviously bad. <br> <br>I realize that most of you that visit this site are type experts, but I've seen (and posted) some questions that indicate a lack of expertise in the fine points of type. A lot of "Susie/Sam" secretary types are being forced to produce things that they have absolutely no training for. Think about all those horrible websites you've visited with 50 different fonts and not a single headline kerned. UGH! <br> <br>Some of the free fonts appear to be really good in their photoshop rendition at the download but print awful when you use them. Maybe also include things like what's the difference between using a Bitstream font vs a Pizzadude font that look about the same. Maybe I'm the only font junkie who knows enough to be dangerous but not enough to know the difference between dentation and hinting. (Okay, I know the difference, but I looked it up). <br> <br>I know quite a bit on how to design with type, but maybe not why mixing a slab serif with grotesque is visually pleasing. Instead of trying every font in my repertoire which, believe me, can take hours; I, and possible others as well, might like to know why they work together. Therefore being able to make more informed type choices the next time they're asked to design work. <br> <br>It's just an idea to help raise the bar of good design and type usage. Any thoughts?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like this and it's getting the wheels turning. <br> <br>I recently 'decloaked' and feel like a rank amateur (though a dedicated one) in the presence of some highly skilled professionals. It would be really nice to have some kind of Good Font Bad Font clinic and maybe PDFs that go along with each. <br> <br>As for your closing idea about type selection maybe some of the professionals could outline their processes and they could all be published in one place, and people could see and try different selection methods. The Type Selection Advisor... <br> <br>I realize that any of this takes a lot of work and not a little co-ordination. Maybe these are two subjects for Typophile Courses? Maybe they are something else. <br> <br>What's dentation?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jon and Dawn...these are excellent ideas and not to <br>sidetrack from them... <br> <br>but in the interest of newbie learning, <br>I can point out a few sites that might have articles of interest. <br> <br><a href=http://www.typographi.ca/ target=_blank>www.typographi.ca/</a> <br> <br>Stewf and Joshua's typography journal is required reading <br>if you already don't go there. Also, follow some of the <br>links off to the right to explore more type sites. <br> <br>Nick Shinn has some great articles on his site <br>written for a graphic designer audience. <br> <br><a href=http://www.shinntype.com target=_blank>www.shinntype.com</a> <br> <br>Also, <br> <br><a href=http://www.creativepro.com target=_blank>www.creativepro.com</a> <br> <br>lots of writing about type by Jon Berry <br> <br><a href=http://www.underware.nl target=_blank>www.underware.nl</a> <br>Click on "type basics" <br> <br><a href=http://briem.ismennt.is/ target=_blank>http://briem.ismennt.is/</a> <br> <br>Gunnlaugur SE Briem of Iceland and his type design tutorials. <br> <br>at the bookstore... <br> <br>from the GD perspective, <br>books by Robin Williams. books by HOW. Pretty <br>much any of the Graphic Design books have something in <br>them to learn or typography to see. <br> <br>also, <br>Typophile has its own library <br> <br><a href=http://typophile.com/books/ target=_blank>http://typophile.com/books/</a> <br> <br>and its own librarian, Tiffany! <br> <br>Two books to seek out early on: <br>* The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst <br>* Type & Typography by Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam. <br> <br>X off some of those things and you'll have a decent starting point. <br> <br>I'm sure I've left some stuff out and put some stuff in <br>that doesn't belong. <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>bj, Thanks for the reading list! I'll add the ones that I haven't already read (gratifyingly few) to my list. typographi.ca is on my list and so is Briem. I have been using the Books section here as a checklist already. <br> <br> I think that I like Dawn's idea of Good Type Bad Type so much because (as I understand it) she's asking for very specific examples. The only example I have seen of a comparison between a Good Type and a rip-off is in <i>Branding With Type</i> from Adobe press and it has only a single example, useful but not detailed. I imagine comparisons of set text, and detailed close-ups on the parts of the letterforms as is regularly done in the Critiques forums. <br> <br>Bringhurst is the only one I have read so far that expresses his approach to type selection, not counting Tschihold's simple perscription in <i>The New Typography</i>. I know there will be more information about selecting type as I continue my research and education, but what do <i>you</i> do? <br> <br>Thanks again for your suggestions. <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>it sounds like you want someone to do all of the work <br>for you -- not that I wouldn't love that scenario as well. <br> <br>the difference between good and bad typographers is <br>the same as the difference between good and bad <br>type: commitment. you can't force someone to be <br>passionate about what they do, and you can't <br>compress volumes of typographic knowledge into a <br>quick how-to. for those who want to learn and will put <br>their learning to use, we can recommend some <br>invaluable resources for their professional growth. for <br>those who don't bother to search out those resources, <br>they will continue to be poor to mediocre typographers, <br>and none of us will fault them for that decision. <br> <br>in addition to bj's great suggestions, I would add the <br>following (by no means making the list complete): <br> <br>Haley, Allen. _Hot Designers Make Cool Fonts_ : a <br>terrible title, but a nice look into the designers behind <br>quality faces. <br> <br>Tschichold, Jan. _Form of the Book_ : the culmination of <br>years of intense research and practice -- nothing like <br>_The New Typograhy_. a collection of essays that are <br>short and to the point. don't attempt book typogaphy <br>without this one. <br> <br>Swanson, Gunnar. _Graphic Design and Reading_ : a <br>collection of essays that covers many of the debates <br>that we obsessives tend to get into. includes Warde's <br>classic Crystal Goblet illustration and a piece by <br>Typophile's very own Hrant Papazian on his wild and <br>crazy alphabet reform concept. I really enjoy reading <br>this one! <br> <br>Carter, Rob et al. _Typographic Design_. a superb <br>overview from the designer's perspective. <br> <br>Meggs, Phillip. _Type and Image_ : a more broad view <br>from the designer's perspective. as the title implies, this <br>gets into the whole visual package and even deals a bit <br>with semantics.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just yesterday Dawn, you asked which Barmeno you should <br>buy, the concensus seemed to be FF Sari. Over the years <br>there have been a good number of threads where someone <br>asks, "Which Bodoni?" or "Which Garamond?" Or where <br>people want to know the difference between Swiss and <br>Helvetica or Humanist and Gill Sans. <br> <br>It would take a bit of leg work, but not much else, to get a <br>jumpstart on that somewhat subjective (not definitive), but <br>helpful list of recommended versions of classic typefaces. <br> <br>Any volunteers to search the archives and start the thread?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> "Which Bodoni?" or "Which Garamond?" <br> <br>There's a book btw that tries to do that: <br>"Type: the best in digital classic text fonts" by Tom Carnase and Baruch Gorkin (Graphis, '95). <br> <br>It's mostly a glorified -and limited- specimen book, and might even be seen as too narrow in perspective (like you'd never see a Storm font in there), but it could still be useful. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> "Type: the best in digital classic text fonts" <br> <br>If that's the book I know, I wouldn't recommend it. Like Hrant said, it's limited. Very very limited. You'll see specimens of typefaces like Caslon, Cheltenham, Futura, Helvetica. But there are no comparisons between different versions or any explanatory texts. <br> <br>A better book about this, IMO, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1883915082/qid=1064512007/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/104-0187278-3339964?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" target=_blank> "Revival of The Fittest"</a>, edited by Philip Meggs and Roy McKelvey. It's a nice collection of articles about digital revivals of classical typefaces. Unlike Carnase's book, this one is full of illustrated comparisons and samples. This book is too colorful for my taste, but it may be a good reference anyway.</div>

<div class=commentbody>plain*clothes: First I would like to say thanks for the additional titles. I already own <i>Graphic Design and Reading</i>, and will be adding the others to my long (and hopefully interminable reading) list. <br> <br>I also want to say: No, I <b>never</b> said I want somebody to do all the work for me. <b>Never</b>. I don't want somebody to do all the work for me. I can do it, but sometimes I need to be shown how. I am sorry if that's the impression that you have come away with. I also don't think that you can compress volumes of typographic knowledge into a quick how-to. <br> <br>I do think that there are few examples that compare the deatils and results of using good quality type with rip-off type and would love to see more. I believe that asking after somebody's methodology and process in fact shows a sincere desire to develop skills, find best practices, and shows real dedication. <br> <br>I know myself enough to know that I take exception far too quickly to many fair minded suggestions. If you feel I have done so here, then accept my apologies in advance. <br> <br>Hrant: Thank you too for your suggestions. <br> <br>Joseph: An excellent idea. I will volunteer. I imagine a summation of those threads would be the most useful. No small amount of work but no way to do it but start. Look for my initial post with my plan soon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"I believe that asking after somebody's methodology <br>and process in fact shows a sincere desire to develop <br>skills, find best practices, and shows real dedication." <br> <br>I think my brief post sounded sharper than I intended. I <br>think you (and the rest of us here) are going about it <br>the proper way. by sharing our knowledge and asking <br>the basic questions, we can establish and challenge <br>foundations. <br> <br>I was attempting to say that you have to read some <br>essential typographic texts and really study their <br>implications. until you have done so, no comparative <br>discussion will be very effective -- you'll get the idea for <br>the faces compared, but you still won't understand the <br>underlying theories. that said, I think the list you have <br>generously volunteered to assemble will be a great <br>resource for those who want to investigate the <br>theories they have read about.</div>

<div class=commentbody>plain*clothes: I've never asked anyone to do all the work. I just want to be more informed. Not only do I work on a variety of non-prof work, I taught myself how to design 2 websites last summer with no help at all--which greatest compliment of all were basically ripped off and reused at a pro sport site, I also volunteer and do PC admin support at my child's school (which I learned how to do because my tech guys couldn't install my hardware in the 80s--real live tech support was great back them). I never charge a dime for anything I do and I've spent months with less than 1 hour of sleep to reach a deadline. <br> <br>That said, I'm a geek that likes to know every detail about what I'm working on and am perfectionist who wants the best job I can. I like to share my areas of expertise when I can and I also love to learn from those who are experts in their field. <br> <br>hhp: thanks for the great list. I already had several of them bookmarked and I added the rest. <br> <br>Technology moves so fast it's like going to college. You might take classes all over the campus and be exposed to a variety of things, but you don't major in everything. In my working as both tech support and graphic support for several large companies and schools, I've just found that the people who get thrust into these situations aren't truly equipped to do their jobs, nor do they know where to go. When I was first learning there weren't as many resources to get both good and bad info from. I'd like to have a place where I can refer myself and those I support to find out about type and how to really use it correctly, creatively, and ethically from people that know the best way. <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16689.html?1064504736 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16689.html?1064504736</a> is a thread of a college student trying to find out the impact of type. Type is no longer restricted to print, it is a myriad of multifaceted tentacles that reach everywhere. And many of us out here are one man bands. I design, program, write, self-train, purchase, install and support everything I do from my kitchen table. If you design in a workplace, you can go to the cubicle next to you and white board with the designer next to you. <br> <br>The value and the talent that is available at this site in incredible. The opportunity to learn from some of the best in the field is exciting and humbling. I'd love to be able to read every book on typography, web design, css, html programming, javascripting, network solutions, etc. to do my job properly, but if you check some of my postings, I really need that hour of sleep. I admit I understand type and have several books not just on typography but the history of type as well, but it's not MY area of expertise. In addition, I and others in my same situation just don't have the time to do our work and read every new book on the market and decide which book has good info and which one doesn't. Sometimes 20 min online can educate me as much as spend 2 days reading a huge book. Resources are the key to doing great design, and after 20 years of doing graphics and pc admin, these resources provide inspiration and an opportunity to learn no ways to improve my work! <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry for the delay, <br>it seems I've misplaced or mixed up the 242 with the 262. <br>Lord knows I have been a-searching. <br> <br>This scan is from a copy of display matrices, series 262 I made in London from a Monotype type sampler. <br>Unfortunately my recollections of its data are a bit too vague to share here. <br> <br>When I was searching in my drawers I also found a copy I made of the 353, the Gill sans poster type. <br>I'll see when I get time to upload it. It's kinda nice as well. <br> <br>About the upload: <br>The letters above are 60 pt, the ones below 72 pt. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Fredrik, thanks for taking the time and making the effort. This will deserve a little closer attention than I can pay at this time. Off the top I see the differences in the lc b and d between the first example from H</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Fredrik! It sure is fantastic to see these examples like this. Am I seeing that right: there's actually a point in the lower right of the counter in 9 in the 353 example? Those mumerals are kind of whacky with what appears to be a really narrow 3, an extremely wide 4, and an apparent decrease in bowl size from 5 to 6. <br> <br>Would anybody happen to have an example of output from a rip-off of Gill Sans or Humanist to compare to these lovely examples?</div>
