  it just me or does this face not have small caps/osf? That would be a disappointment,
  considering its lovely form.\r\n\r\nFurther, aside from the name, I don't see anything
  uniquely Spanish about it. "

    agree it's a nice font - I just used it for a cookbook."

    no less. Definitely more appealing than her other work (Ari*l).

    she's not credited for.

  body: "From the specimen that was issued when Columbus was released, I learn that
    Patricia Saunders joined the Monotype Type Drawing office in 1951, and that she
    worked on \"adapting Spectrum for Monotype composition and also on producing...Castellar....She
    has also been involved in making several adaptations...such as Bell, Centaur,
    Felix Titling, Waubaum and Van Dijck for digital typesetting.\"\r\n\r\nColumbus
    was issued in 1992, the quincentenary of, well, of 1492. The specimen tells me
    it was based on a type used by Jorge Coci, active in Saragossa in the early 1500's.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a shame the recent Ascender OpenType release of the face didn't include any of
    the goodies: no smallcaps, no OsFs, no ornaments or borders."
