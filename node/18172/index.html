================================

- NEW DEVICE FONTS COLLECTION 8: "ZEPHYRMEN"
Hot on the heels of Collection 7 ("Pagodaland") comes another 15 Device families released under the code name "Zephyrmen". As we've come to expect from Rian it's an extremely varied and versatile collection of type, ranging from distressed (Roadkill, Zond Diktat) to playful (Catseye, Custard), historical (Mulgrave is based on cast-iron Victorian street signs) to futuristic (Gentry, Gridlocker). The 7 weight "Ministry" typeface is a notable revival, created after viewing the Ministry of Transport signage designs in the National Archives in Kew. All new releases are magnificently detailed in the new Device book "Ten Year Itch" (see below).

- TEN YEAR ITCH: The definitive Device Fonts resource
Workaholic type designer and illustrator supreme, Rian Hughes celebrates ten years of font releases the only way he knows how, by sweating blood on a mammoth 160 page type specimen documenting the entire Device collection. Stuffed to the brim with samples, text settings, background info on each font and with a foreword by Erik Spiekermann this book is a visual feast for type fans. If you've admired Rian's work over the years the book will be indispensable. The softback version has fold out flaps featuring a cross section of logos designed for various clients and if you're really quick you may be able to purchase the extremely limited edition (only 150 exist) hardback volume with full colour dustjacket and a lime green embossed hard cover, signed and numbered by Rian. The book is officially unveiled in March but Fontworks have advance copies available to purchase now; e-mail sales@type.co.uk to place your order.
