  body: "From Roger Black\u2019s Blog:\r\n\r\n\u2014But in 2004, the Guardian decided
    to dramatically reduce the size of the paper to \"Berliner\" size, 47 x 32 cm,
    to better compete with The Times and the Independent, which had gone tabloid.
    Porter felt that more than size had to be changed, to help the paper deal with
    the competition\u2014particularly from the web. The news executives in London
    felt the pressure of circulation and advertising declines that are affecting newspapers
    all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian had played the Internet game very well.
    Neville Brody designed a brilliant web site, Guardian Unlimited. Yet, that was
    not enough. Porter wanted a complete typographical change, to signal the paper's
    currency and relevance just as strongly as the Hillman design had done in the
    '80s.\r\n\r\nHe called in Paul Barnes, who'd been an adviser during the previous
    round of typeface changes, and Barnes hired Christian Schwartz. (Disclosure: I
    worked with each of these guys at the beginning of their careers.)\r\n\r\nClearly,
    Porter wanted to make the same break with the old design as David Hillman had
    with the Old Labor. The Hillman legacy he thought had again begun to take on the
    dank odor of an old Manchester basement. Papers everywhere had changed, catching
    up with the design, and the Guardian had to break out of the pack.\r\n\r\nHe started
    with Gerard Unger's Gulliver, which had raised newsroom eyebrows when it was adopted
    by Richard Curtis at USA Today in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn Lisbon, Barnes and Schartz described
    a gruelingly long-run type development process. The Airbus 380 probably has had
    fewer design iterations. The team marched away from Gulliver, back through some
    Aster-like Old Styles, then did quite a great number variations to something they
    called \"Hacienda,\" only to abandon it all all in favor of an updated slab, that
    looks, uh, a bit like Gulliver. But, that's not all. They ran up some 50 different
    weights, and then made an sans serif set as well.\r\n\r\nWhat an effort! What
    a client!\r\n\r\nThe design got off the ground a year ago on schedule, unlike
    the great Euro double-decker, and to much designer applause (one of those fat
    pencils from the D&AD and \"world's best-designed newspaper\" award from the SND).\r\n\r\nPorter
    said the editor's, Alan Russbridger's brief for the redesign was for something
    \"modern\" and \"austere.\" He got both. But did he get the Guardian?\r\n\r\nDoes
    it make sense to to abandon the traditional forms of newspapers as much as possible,
    so that, for one thing, the younger generation doesn't attach the stigma they
    do to the traditional papers? Does it make sense to get rid of a modern classic
    (Helvetica) and a sweet 19th century revival type (Miller) and bet the farm on
    a contemporary, Unger-wannabe?\r\n\r\nMoreover, does it make sense to move so
    far away from a successful typographic design? (The layouts and spacing are still
    quite reminiscent of the Hillman style.) Do readers have any feelings about these
    things? I think they do.\u2014\r\n\r\nErgo: custom job."
