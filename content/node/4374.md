  body: Right. I just saw that some books had pages to look at while others didn&#39;t,
    and thought maybe some got lost along the way. Jared must be a busy guy, so I
    won&#39;t complain too much.

  body: 'Grant&#39;s recent inquiry into this has prodded me back into action on this
    project. I had three books destroyed by an irresponsible paper cutter and it really
    sunk my sails for a bit. But I&#39;m back in the saddle on it and hope to get
    the other books out before too long.  <BR> <BR>The short story on the project
    is this: One book disappeared the moment I gave it at TypeCon to an East Coast
    student, a second book has been to Russia &#40;and back? I&#39;ve lost this one
    as well, but heard it went to the last ATypI conference&#41; and the third one,
    our most prosperous, has been bouncing around Brazil for months. I have some images
    to post on that one. <BR> <BR>In the meantime I&#39;ve been building a new world-map
    flash engine to track each book and potential recipients in the vicinity, as a
    sizeable number of people would like to participate. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any
    sightings of the book&#40;s&#41; in question, please post it here. <BR> <BR>Last
    sightings: <BR>Book 18: Alexander Bohn &#40;East Coast&#41; / 23 July 2003 - &#40;email:
