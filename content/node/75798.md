  the old colonial Spanish cemeteries in St. Augustine, FL for his album cover. I
  couldn't come up with much when searching \"old Spanish font,\" and thought ya'll
  might be able to suggest some places to look. It would be especially awesome to
  find a free one! I attached the image that will accompany the text. Anyone have
  any suggestions?\r\n\r\nAlec"

  body: "Alec... the classification may lead you in many directions and there are
    not many true fonts listed on the standard sites, but look up Rotunda.\r\n\r\nMost
    of the foundries would not know it if bit them in the ass, they classify many
    of them wrong, so do some research. You may end up finding reference that you
    can use or \"old\" fonts that would help you draw/extrapolate your own."
