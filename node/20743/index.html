  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have found the perfect letter 'B' for a tribute tattoo. It is the elegant Schneidler by Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler, who is sometimes referred to as F. H. Schneidler. 

I can find little biographical informational about him in English. He seems to have been born and died in Germany, during the mid-century. Does anyone happen to know about his ties to the Third Reich. I just want to make sure that I don't commemorate my Jewish grandfather with an state-sponsored designer. Thank you for your assistance.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I suggest you avoid any German designer and make a 'B' on your own. You can't really trust the biographer, can you? What if it was a propaganda plan to fill the world with nazist B's so they wrote a fake biography just to fool people like you and me in the future? I hope you are young enough to learn how to make tattoos since you can never be sure the tattoo person is not a nazist. Good luck and send us a pic (not taken by Leica of course)</div>

I agree. Thus, the importance of knowing the designer's biography, to better understand her ideas and how they fit within a time and a place. So when you critique the value of a movie do you not consider the time in which it was created and how the director fit in to that time period? Seriously, please explain.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course you better understand her work by knowing the historical context. But I think you can't say "oh she did that work for Hitler so she is a bad artist." Many great people that lived in Germany at that period are now depreciated by questions like "what if she/he was a nazi". I don't try to be the smart one here but I think neither Leni Riefenstahl knew what was going on neither the Jews in Germany. That's why so many did not leave the country. I think that American Government is just a more elegant butcher. You can ask native americans, black people, the japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki about that. I am not saying the people of Afghanistan and Iraq since your government has not finished the holy job there yet.</div>

"Staatlich" is this sense means that the school was publicly-funded, but almost all German institutions of higher learning were/are funded by the state. In this case, the state is not the "State" (i.e., the national government in Berlin), but the "state" (i.e., the local province of Württemberg, now part of a larger post-war German state, Baden–Württemberg).

So the school got, and still gets, its funding from the state government, which was/is seated in Stuttgart. It wasn't a National school, just a state-funded one. Even the Bauhaus, when it was located in Weimar, had the word "staatlich" in its name (staatliches Bauhaus zu Weimar).

I don't know anything about Schneidler. I can't say what his politics were. And to try to make judgments based on three-line biographies is impossible and not really something to recommend. But, since he was employed by the state government from 1921–1948, it is probably safe to assume that, when the Nazis came into power in 1933, they did not have a problem with him. That doesn't mean that he was a Nazi, it just means that he wasn't Jewish/Handicapped/Openly-Gay/Gypsi/A Communist/A Trade-Union Supporter/anything else the Nazis didn't approve of. Maybe he was completely apolitical, or maybe he just kept his opinions to himself. Or maybe he loved Hitler and all that, but just kept teaching instead of joining the party or the SS. We can't know from just a few lines in a biography. He clearly did not become too involved in the Nazi way of being, because he wasn't fired after the war, but was able to keep working until retirement in 1948, it seems.

Oh, and just to stir up the pot: I think that Riefenstahl knew. Just because she denied knowing anything after the war doesn't mean that she should be believed at face value. She made a lot of pro-government propaganda. Whether she believed everything in it is less important than this glaring act. She tried to get other Germans to go along with it all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Your concern for the memory of your grandfather is touching. If you want to do more, learn more about Judaism. 

Tatooing is against Jewish tradition as it is explicitly prohibited in the Torah (Leviticus 19:18). It seems that the origin of the prohibition is that it was part of pagan practices--pagans would tatoo the names or symbols of the gods they worshipped on their bodies. Also there is a rabbinic prohibition against harming the body--unless for an important benefit, as in surgery--as one's body is created by God.

2. 'Kon', your comment about Leni Riefenstahl really stinks. She knew of Hitler's violently anti-Jewish views and admired him anyway. Also she  certainly later knew of the public support of attacks on Jews, and the laws dispossessing them of their homes and livelihoods. According to the Wikipedia article on her, she late in life--in 2002--falsely said that Gypsies in one of her movies all survived the war. She was sued by a Gypsy for holocaust denial--a crime in Germany now, I believe--and only was let off the hook by the judge because of withdrawing her claim and her extreme age.  

Your equation of the US and Hitler is also outrageously unfair, but I won't go there. </div>

In inquiring about Schneidler's biography, I simply wanted to know whether his work was commisioned by the government for propoganda purposes. Just because a man happened to be German during the war does not necessarily make him a criminal. But if he knew his work was being subsidised for nefarious purposes, that's another story.

I don't know whethere it's true or not but some things have been said about Gill for example. So if Dan Brown discovers and tells us at his next book his sexual preferences showing that the curves of the letters resemble curves of kids' bodies then we must stop liking the man and/or his art? And probably Microsoft will make cleartype fonts with a new name. What I said about Leni Riefenstahl was that she was a talented director for that period. I am not judging her ideas. 

[timd] I did not try to do a logical analysis. I was saying some thoughts. But I am happy you found it logical.

[William Berkson] When did I equate US with Hitler? I am talking about the American Government. If some american citizens want to identify themselves with the government then those americans too.

		<div class="commentbody">I actually think that it is OK to ask someone in a discussion like this if he is Jewish, at least if he is asking about something to help commemorate his Jewish grandfather. Understanding the "client" (or in this case, the member who posted the question!) is integral to giving the best advice/solution/answers.

I'm an American, although I don't live there at the moment. And while I don't share your belief that my government is made up of butchers, elegant ones or not, I respect your right to think that way, even though it makes me sad that you do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I guess the real issue is do we judge an artist based soley on the work or on a wider context. I don't know the answer or if their is one but I tend to think that while knowing intentions is not necessarily relevant, some understanding may in fact be important. Thoughts?  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well Dan, I would really prefer your truth than mine and I would pick it up If I could. But I just think that people killed at Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and who knows where next are not actors in a Hollywood movie. American soldiers killed in Iraq reached 2,500 and who knows what casualties the Iraqi people have suffered. Such evidence make me think so bad about your government.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What annoys me is that all of these seemingly ill intended remarks lack any resolution for the question at hand. Talking about it seems purposed only to stir debate, regaurdless if it has insofar been rather civil.

Worse yet is that if I respond in kind I will only further deviate from the topic. So I bite my tongue...bah.</div>
