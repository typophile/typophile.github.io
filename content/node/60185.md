body: I can't figure out what these two sans-serif typefaces are. The Art Canada one
  reminds me a bit of Avant Garde Gothic the way the R looks. I can't even guess at
  a similar font to WATERWORKS. Any ideas? You guys always seem to be helpful.

  body: "Yeah I can see some similarities. Maybe someone has something closer. I think
    Neutraface was based on some older building signage (kind made out of metal) and
    that's where I got this from and then cleaned it up. Perhaps it is from Richard
    Neutra's work though I don't know if it was widely available back then or just
    on the houses he designed.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tylorjreimer.com/\">Tylor
