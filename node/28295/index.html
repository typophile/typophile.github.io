<p>Only one problem.</p>
<p>Anyone have a copy of them? I&rsquo;ve been hunting all over for a good photograph or rubbing or book specimen or anything. No luck. I bet I could find something, maybe, at the Library, but they don&rsquo;t like me because I keep books for too long ;(</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a good book with specimens to look for? Or does anyone have available a high res image or images?</p>
<p>I appreciate it advance by the way. Anything you can do will help.</p>

<p>Otherwise try hunting through the libraries (you can get &lsquo;em back on time, honest) and secondhand bookshops near you. Almost all of the lettering books for commercial artists and signwriters from the first half of the 20thC contained at least one version of the authors&rsquo; take on the Trajan lettering. My own favourite would be p.29 of &lsquo;The Art of Lettering&rsquo; by Geoffrey Mott, but this material is very commonplace and for less than $20, cheap.</p>

It consists of loose-leaf prints of Trajan rubbings. It didn&rsquo;t seem worth the money to me, but it might be available in some university libraries. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be something you could checkout from a library though, since it isn&rsquo;t bound. The Goudy book is probably much, much more useful.</div>

<p>Daniel, if you make a Trajan, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having a &ldquo;V&rdquo; in place of the &ldquo;U&rdquo; (or if that&rsquo;s too much for you, do give the &ldquo;U&rdquo; the two full stems).</li>
<li>Putting that little triangle thing in the blank space.</li>
<li>Not including severely out-of-character characters, like the &ldquo;@&rdquo;. This would make the font less versatile, but that&rsquo;s the point: it would also make it hold its character better over time/usage. The fact that Adobe Trajan is too versatile causes it to be used by the likes of ISUZU, ruining its focus for everybody else.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">There would be two &ldquo;distress&rdquo; aspects to doing a font based on lapidary inscriptions.
First would be the original uneven execution of the letter carvings &ndash; they were painted on by brush first, with that process producing irregularity in form, as did the subsequent carving, which was interpretive (even if it was done by the same artist &ndash; which we will never know).
Secondly, the effect of centuries of weather (on outdoor inscriptions).</div>

<p>Many other books reproduce photos of the Victorian cast that resides in the British Museum. The BM cast has been modified in several ways from the Roman original. For example, a serif has been added to the inside of the right leg of the &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I strongly reccomend working from the Catich plates in &ldquo;Origin&rdquo;.</p>

<li>Having a “V” in place of the “U”.</li>

<li>Not including severely out-of-character characters, like the “@”.</li>

<li>Ligatures, and keep them coming.</li>

<p>It wd be gd to compile a std set of abbrev.s for Engl and code it in.
In Tim&rsquo;s sample, it lks like whenev. they forgot a letr they just went bk and put a line next door II where it shd have been.</p>
<p>We use Mr, etc. in the same way that IMP was used (Imperator) in Marc&rsquo;s example, but we don&rsquo;t put a &ldquo;macron&rdquo; over them.</p>
<p>But seriously&hellip;Roman inscriptions had lots of abbreviations, because Trajanus hisselfus had a heck of a title, for one reason, and it helped justification, for another. And made for less work for the carver (paid by the word?). If the same principle were applied and fontized, a model would perhaps be 18th or 19th century correspondence, where writers used a kind of shorthand to speed up writing &ndash; or when the end of a line is getting near and it doesn&rsquo;t look like all your words will fit. Another model would be texting today, but perhaps too anachronistic for a Trajan?</p>

You can make the decision to limit the versatility of a font (not out of hooliganism, but out of a hope of helping it maintain its focus) but you can still worry about how it might be used (which is still the point of a font, in the end).

<p>Of course there&rsquo;s a truth in that, but there&rsquo;s also a danger, the one that I mentioned: the more you facilitate some people&rsquo;s use of the font in a way contrary to its &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; character*, the more they&rsquo;ll ruin it for everybody, because the font&rsquo;s associations become diluted in the public eye. On the other hand, having neither a &ldquo;U&rdquo;, &ldquo;J&rdquo; nor a &ldquo;C&rdquo; could be said to be too puritanical, too limiting. So maybe a good compromise would be to default in the &ldquo;archaic spelling&rdquo; using OT and allow the user to revert to the &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; characters, but only proactively.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know this seems like a fascist attitude, and I&rsquo;m all for being nicely surprised by unexpected usage, but I think this really is essentially a matter of long-term functionality. The key thing to me is that we already have highly (too?) versatile Trajan-style fonts, and Dan would be contributing more by being different.</li>

Hi Hrant. Are you still of this opinion?
I agree on what you say (Paul Shaw thought also numerals were out of place in Trajan), but if everything &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is removed, we should not have accented characters as well, currency symbols et al.
It seems to me the crucial points among all the ones mentioned are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The [U], which could be kept as an alternative;</li>
<li>The addition politypes, where it&rsquo;s appropriate (not excessive, like you said);</li>
</ol>
<p><cite> * I know this seems like a fascist attitude. </cite>
What do you mean by &ldquo;fascist&rdquo;? As an Italian, I&rsquo;m so used to the word that I still can&rsquo;t get what&rsquo;s the dominant feelings associated with it. They are mostly negative, but this doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

I agree entirely on this, I think it can also be experienced and seen by anyone.</p>

No, it was a thing he told me when he visited me in Modena in 2002. I was accompanying him by car at the Train station, and we were still talking about why he did not like the excessively eterogeneous nature of my letter &ldquo;experiments&rdquo;, and what constituted a typeface&rsquo;s integrity.
But I don&rsquo;t think he would bother re-affirming it, it was not a negative criticism, he considers Carol Twombly&rsquo;s work very well done. A pity it&rsquo;s so widespread and unconsciosly used, I add…</p>
<p>Fascism: I would say &ldquo;forcing&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;telling&rdquo;. Telling it may be, and it generally is, for the good. This is not a correct use of the word to me, anway. Fascism, despite all its negativity in the dictatorial aspect, had good things going on. Anyway, I would use &ldquo;dictatorial&rdquo;, but this opens another linguistic problem… :P</p>

<p><em>&lt;irony&gt;</em>Since font users can’t be trusted to use historically-based fonts appropriately, more needs to be done than just to eliminate historically-inaccurate glyphs (such as U, J, and @). Clearly, users should not be allowed to use historically-based fonts for anachronistic text. For example, when using Imperivm (or similar Trajan based fonts) copy such as TRIVMPHAL ARCH should be allowed, but the open-type font software should screen for and block text such as IVICY FRVIT GVM.<em>&lt;/irony&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;deeper irony&gt;</em>On second thought, for true historical accuracy, the Imperivm font should only allow text in Latin. Any other language would clearly be anachronistic.<em>&lt;/deeper irony&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;serious comment&gt;</em>The advocates of historically-accurate font use, need to keep in mind that the users of Imperivm (and similar fonts) are NOT in ancient Rome craving the glyphs in stone &ndash; they are using them on paper and electronic devices worldwide in the 21st century, so there is already a built-in anachronism in the use of these fonts. Users should be permitted to use the fonts however they please (whether we like the results or not). All fonts ought to be available with the widest possible set of glyphs (including the dreaded @).<em>&lt;/serious comment&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;postscript&gt;</em>Dan, what’s the status of Imperivm? Any samples you could post? <em>&lt;/postscript&gt;</em>

If you allow me, that&rsquo;s my own decision as a designer. If I produce a work, I decide how it functions, and I reflect upon its use with my own choices as a designer and &ldquo;page planner&rdquo; in mind.
Whether people will use it according to the functions of its &ldquo;organism&rdquo;, it depends on how I (as its designer) decide to sell or make it available. It&rsquo;s clear that freedom is largely perceived in an absolute value, but we do not live on an absolute plane, since we have to deal with the sensibility of our fellow men.
So, you will agree that I may propose an intended usage out of assumed expectations, even if this exludes an &ldquo;@&rdquo; sign, if this is my cultural intention.</div>

<p>Adults help children do the right thing (because of their experience and knowledge), and everybody is childlike in some contexts.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Claudio and Hrant,</p>
<p>It may be a type designer&rsquo;s preference that certain glyphs not be available. After all, in the case of the @ glyph, the user could simply spell out the word “at,&quot; but you know what happens in the real world &ndash; if a glyph is not available, the user is likely to substitute one from another font instead. (If he or she wants an @, they will get one, one way or another.)</p>
<p>It seems better to me that type designers should control the design of <em>all</em> the glyphs that might be used in contemporary communication.</p>
<p>Glyphs are not only a design issue; they are also a content issue. Users should be allowed to say whatever they want, using a complete set of glyphs to choose from. Omitting glyphs because the type designer doesn&rsquo;t feel they are historically appropriate, results in a form of censorship: &ldquo;You can’t say that using my font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems better to me that type designers should control the design of all characters that might be used in communication, and also recognize the fact that their fonts are being used in the 21st Century (and hopefully beyond). If you create a font in the 21st Century, it should be capable of being fully used in contemporary documents; otherwise the font just becomes obsolete historical font, or worse a font where users mix in other fonts to add the missing glyphs.</p>
<p>In summary, type designers should not sit in judgment as to which of their glyphs may or may not be used once the font is released to the world, nor should they try control whether or not their fonts are used appropriately. (They, are of course, entitled to their own opinions, and are welcome to speak their minds, but they should not try to enforce those opinions on others by withholding glyphs they feel are inappropriate.)

<p>Well, I suppose we will have to agree to disagree.</p>
<p>As I said in my original post on this subject, people &ldquo;are NOT in ancient Rome craving the glyphs in stone — they are using them on paper and electronic devices worldwide in the 21st century, so there is already a built-in anachronism in the use of these fonts.&rdquo; If people want to use Trajan (or similar fonts) for e-mails, that should be their prerogative, not the type-designer&rsquo;s prerogative.</p>
<p>Should Caslon only be used for text about 18th Century England? Is it &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; to set an e-mail address in Calson? Should all historically-based fonts only be used for texts relating to time of their creation? I think not.</p>
<p>Glyphs should not be &ldquo;censored&rdquo; in any typeface for the sake of &ldquo;historical accuracy.&rdquo;

On the historical accuracy, the solution offered by Dan is effective.
I care about internal consistency, and conciliation of apparent rivalry, and if an alphabet design is based on a conceptual idea it could also propose censoring or altering, or the fostering of a constructive talk.</p>
<p>Probably we did not understand each other because you were thinking of normal typefaces which should address the expected uses, while I was talking more of an artistic approach with different degrees of functionality, since type design is always on a fascinating balance between art and technique, vision and analisys. I enjoy a constant confrontation between the two approaches, and of course my lapidary logic if modern would include an [@], if ancient, not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>piccic: I agree that we have probably been approaching the subject from different viewpoints. As you point out, a type designer must find a &ldquo;&hellip;balance between art and technique&hellip;&rdquo; In that sense, type design is similar to architecture and other crafts that mix art with utility, and there are no firm rules as to where and how that balance should be achieved.</p>
<p>My own feeling is that if type designer is creating a typeface for his own use (or has been commissioned to create a typeface for a private use), then, of course, the typeface need only contain the glyphs that are needed and desired for it&rsquo;s particular use. However, if the typeface is released for public use, then I believe that the typeface should contain all the glyphs that users might reasonably be expected to use.</p>
<p>I am aware that some feel it would be unreasonable to include, for example, a @ glyph in a historically-based typeface even when released for public use, but to return to the comparison with architecture &ndash; if one were to design a new public building in the style of a Greek temple, should the architect refuse to include rest rooms in the building, or air conditioning, since those items where not part of the original design vocabulary in ancient Greece?

<p>Ooo. Thanks for that hint! I&rsquo;ll start poking around.</p>
<p>Regarding some of the previous conversations, now past the 2 year mark, what would you as the head of major foundry and well respected in the industry say about another version of Trajan? Particularly, if some magazine were to come to you and say that they wanted their own Trajan, how would you approach it?</p>
<p>Obviously in that case the silliness of the opentype substitutions would be gone, and all of the requisite glyphs would need to be created, right?</p>

<p>Well, first I&rsquo;d make sure they were prepared for absolute authority, because that&rsquo;s what Trajan&rsquo;s about. Then &rsquo;d go about the usual specificational due diligence to end up with a few letters that fit the Imperial Roman ambitions of the spec. (why no silliness of the opentype substitutions?). Then, I&rsquo;d take a minute to check and see if I was still the head of major foundry and well respected in the industry and I&rsquo;d send them a bill. If they liked everything so far, I&rsquo;d finish the face. I could not say from this point of view, what the contrast would be nor the extension of the R&rsquo;s leg might be into the future.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

That&rsquo;s what I was thinking about, and to reply AtoZ: yes, I am generally motivated on a personal level. I guess I&rsquo;ll never be a type designer full-time doing large families: I like to use type as much as to design it, and I think all that had motivated me most is when I don&rsquo;t find what I am looking for among existing typefaces (I recall Jon Barnbrook wrote something similar once).</p>
<p>About the Trajan, what I wonder is if it&rsquo;s better to have more than one model, especially for Capitalis. After all, there are other notable inscriptions from the period, and examples, which may not be so refined as the Trajan column inscriptions, but nonethelss give material for a more comprehensive inclusion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>RE: Opentype
I meant only that the substitutional rhetoric would be done away with. The @ sign would be just that. Not &ldquo;AT&rdquo;.</p>
<p>RE: Absolute Authority
That&rsquo;s an interesting perspective that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about before. Why else would they have erected such columns, if not to boast about their military prowess.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why Trajan the typeface feels out of place on many movie posters, because it is used for the wrong reason, and without any thought to the attitude of the typeface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to look into that more.</p>

Hmm… I did not think about it in terms of &ldquo;military prowess&rdquo;.
What&rsquo;s that suggests you such an association?
The adjective &ldquo;authority&rdquo; comes from the &ldquo;author&rdquo;, which here is the designer (or stonecarver), the authoritative people which seriously and honestly study some matter, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;creator&rdquo;, anyone to which you could turn to if you need to grade your work and improve.</p>
<p>Negative associations with &ldquo;authority&rdquo; are more a modern phenomena, related to the apparent disillusion people nurture towards the conduction of a community, state et al. and towards the possibility of peace, refusing the idea of war, which is sometimes unavoidable.
It&rsquo;s a negative mood which sets a &ldquo;pessimistic&rdquo; view upon one&rsquo;s personal improvement and upon a charitative attitude which should be universal, and not just &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;.
Of course, the Roman model may not be the better to convey the inherently positive concept of &ldquo;authority&rdquo;, but the forms are beautiful, associated with strenghth and grace, and – at least to me – friendly and not intimidatory.</p>
