  body: "Excellent.  Nicely done.  It is indeed.  I found out it is called Sansa Lloyds.
    \ A custom font for Lloyd's of London.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.lloyds.com/NR/rdonlyres/72DEA2D9-4EDC-4D8B-9946-85201D7937A5/0/Lloyds_Corporation_brand_guidelines06.pdf\">Brand
    Guidelines for the Coorporation of Lloyd's\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI can not find this
    font commercially (or otherwise) available.  But since the numbers are all i need,
    Sansa Soft works perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks so much Atwe."
