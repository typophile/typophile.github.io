  they don't have a hi-res or vector file of their logo. So I'm trying to recreate
  it and would like to use the font that was originally used to create it. But I'm
  stumped.\r\n\r\nHere's the current logo: [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/khedaywi/1809370610/]]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas on the font??\r\n\r\nThanks!"
