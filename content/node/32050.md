  (The complete typographer), I really like this book !\r\n\r\nBut there's something
  I dont understand about the em, they said you take the caps M and the width (la
  chasse) is suppose to be the same as the height. I maked the test with Myriad, Garamond
  etc and there's nothing liked that. Did I misunderstanding someting ?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nM"

  body: "The cap M is only 1 em width in a very few fonts. Even fewer will have the
    cap N exactly 1 en in width.\r\n\r\nThe em is a horizontal dimension that varies
    with typesize. It is defined as being the same size as the pointsize of the face.
    Thus a em is 12 points wide in a 12 point font, but 24 points wide in a 24 point
    font. This makes it especially good for specifying paragraph indents, among other
    things.\r\n\r\n(Also, when you are measuring a font, remember that you must measure
    the ascender, body, and descender space, and even then there might be a small
    additional amount of \"side-bearing\" white space around the characters.)"

    Linecaster's -- which don't use an em system -- how wide an em-space was. \"Why,\"
    he said, \"the width of a capital 'M'\".\r\n\r\nPersonally, I just don't remember
    just what got put in the magazines . . . We've all been working with em-based
    systems for so long."

    used as a unit of type for CSS."

  body: "Marc, with 1000 units per em, Adobe Garamond's M is 912 units wide, and Adobe
    Caslon's M is 981 wide. \r\n\r\nTraditional seriffed M's did have approximately
    square bodies, hence the name for a body width space, which is square, is an 'em
    quad', and we continue to talk about the 'em' in digital type. For more than you
    ever wanted to know, see this thread: http://typophile.com/node/27742"

    there are software publishers, I think. Among other places, you will certainly
    find French language EULAs at the sites of French type founderies, such as <a

    one</a> from the Typofonderie of J-F Porchez. "
