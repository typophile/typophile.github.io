  i have got from my client.\r\n\r\nThis is what i got from my client.\r\nEach word/font
  is supposed to represent it\u2019s meaning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\xB7         Young - Your
  suggestion is appreciated \r\n\r\n\xB7         Dumb \u2013 Your suggestion is appreciated
  \r\n\r\nMy client wants word \"young\" & \"Dumb\" to be used in this design but
  he wants to use font that will represent its meaning. Is that anyone can help for
  this????\r\n\r\nOk if there is no font available in this world for this, then can
  anyone give me idea how can i design the  another font text so my client will happy
  with this????\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time i am really waiting for reply. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nCan

  body: "I think Kermit's advice is good. As another approach look at <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script12Pg1.html\">Part
    12 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> (Childish lettering) for 'Young\". 'Dumb' fonts
    might be in <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html\">Part
    14</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html\">Part 5</a>,
    but you're on your own for what you consider has a 'dumb' quality. \r\n\r\nIf
    I was to pick a 'dumb' font one choice I'd consider is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/doodlebug/\">Doodlebug</a>,
    but 'Dumb' means different things to different people. You may have to show your
    client some choices for that one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Frode, I guess this is a T-Shirt design? \r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n- the
    font for Young, doesn't look young to me\r\n- why the sexy lady?\r\n- arrangement
    of the words seems disconnected\r\n- why a comma (,) not an & or +\r\n- mirroring
    2 letters in Dumb might be to much and decrease legibility, try only the 'B' and
    maybe rotate each letter in Dumb slighty\r\n- also, a stacked version would look
    much better, since you are mixing fonts:\r\n\r\nYOUNG\r\n+DUMB"

    me.\r\n\r\nCan you sugest me the the font looks like young??\r\n\r\nyou said-
    why the sexy lady?\r\n\r\nIt is just the solid black patch of the young girl.
    I didnt found anything that will make me feel so hot & sexy. :P\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    said\r\n- arrangement of the words seems disconnected\r\n- why a comma (,) not
    an & or \r\n\r\nImage I uploaded was not the complete image. Complete image is

    said - mirroring 2 letters in Dumb might be to much and decrease legibility, try
    only the 'B' and maybe rotate each letter in Dumb slighty\r\n\r\nIt is just the
    diffrence of the thinking of 2 brains. I will sure pass your this message to my
    designer. Let me sea what she says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou said- - also, a stacked
    version would look much better, since you are mixing fonts:\r\n\r\nThis point
    might be clear when you see my new uploaded image.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thank you from
    the bottom of my heart for your feebback. This will help us to improve our self.
    I will sure discuss it with my designer."
