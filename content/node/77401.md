  I'm about to present my work to people who may potentially be interested in buying
  it.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if anyone would share: What is the best and most
  professional type of presentation to present your fonts in when submitting to a
  distributor company?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a visual example of such a presentation
  that they could point me to?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    at the PDF specimens that foundries make."

  body: Thanks for the advice Mr. Shinn. I've been bookmarking a lot of foundries
    and I should look at any of their pdf specimens that I can find.
