  much appreciate a critique of a business card I\u2019m designing for a violin maker.\r\nThe
  typography is loosely inspired by the stamps used to make violin labels in late
  17th, early 18th century Italy. Janson, Kis and the like didn't feel quite right
  so I treated myself to Lexicon, so far this is the only irrevocable decision.\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/A_7.jpg\">\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/B_16.jpg\">\r\n\r\nThe
  frontside of the business cards would be letterpress\u2019d from polymere plates
  (the tryouts I made look fairly good). Everything inked except the f-hole which
  would only be embossed. The backside printed with varnish on a paper similar to
  Royal Print containing wood so it gets colored by daylight rather quickly.\r\n\r\n<img

  feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

  body: "Kentlew's suggestion of die cutting the f-hole is a nice idea. (I might make
    it bigger than you have it, though.) \r\n\r\nBut if you emboss it, you may want
    to print the f-hole in a very faint tint (like a tinted varnish) before embossing.
    A small embossing like that can just disappear under some lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nIs
    \"Luthier\" in a smaller point size? It looks smaller to me."

    be too pricey at this stage but adding a faint tint to the emboss sounds very
    good.\r\nThe word \u201CLuthier\u201D is set in the same point size (and as I
    remember x-height) as the rest, this seems to be the italic's design, but maybe
    in this case I could adjust it?\r\n\r\nI was mostly afraid the composition looked
    dull and not very tight somehow."

    because he says it's unclear to some what \"luthier\" means. I'd rather make something
    that only relies on the ageing of varnish (some abstract riddle-ish pattern) and
    let the typography be the only token but it's difficult to convince him that this
    could be clear enough.\r\n\r\nJohan,\r\nI agree, the one the violin maker sent
    me is from an Amati cello, it looks great at display size but if using one I should
    look for a text cut, from a 1/2 violin or something.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://darntonviolins.com/images2/amati-f.jpg\">\r\n<img

  body: "Or: have a black background and make <em>only the f-hole</em> a wood texture!\r\n\r\nBTW,
    that particular f-hole design has an interesting abrupt angle at the ends of the
    inside curves (I'm guessing to reduce the risk of breakage). More suitable than
    Lexicon might be a font that exhibits that characteristic. Maybe something by
    Menhart, or Dwiggins.\r\n\r\nIf an f-hole glyph needs to be made, the integral
    sign is a great place to start (assuming it's not merely a generic math dump-in,
    like many type designers do). And the Florin might be an alternative, depending.\r\n\r\nOh,

  body: "- Especially now that I see the tagline in the French, I think \"improving
    with age\" would be better (and would avoid the US/UK spelling conflict).\r\n\r\n-
    It strikes me that that wood grain looks like curtains... as in: musical performance.
    Don't know what you could do with that though - maybe some kind of red velvet
    tint, or transition?\r\n\r\n- Those long phone number strings look uncomfortable,
    messy; I think their \"wordspace\" is too loose compared to the letterspace. Try
    tightening each pair of numbers. And the parentheses are too high.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and not too appropriate for a business card.\r\n- I agree, this is a quick photoshop

    2 points less than the luthier's name line of text.\r\n- I would increase a little,
    in general, the word spacing (around +10%)\r\n- by my point of view, the motto
    (\"bonifie avec l'age\") should stand on its own, either on top or on the recto
    of the card.\r\n\r\nIf you find a printer able to letterpress it - using a clich\xE9

    nice paper with letters pressed on one size and varnish on the other. I think
    Neil Caldwell's \"trivial tokens\" comment was right on point, every graphic translation
    of a violin's top plate into printed matter will somehow look ridiculous next
    to an instrument, where the cards will be exchanged most of the time.\r\n\r\nI
    tried something without the f-hole, clearer lines of text and a less literal translation
    of the wood's texture but it could maybe still be simpler."
