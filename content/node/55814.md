  unfortunately have to work on a project.\r\nReally sucks but that's life. I am working
  from my parents home in Australia with limited internet and really miss my studio
  back home back in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nI was told by my client who provided me with
  this logo that this is definitely Helvetica, but when I typed it out the G, E is
  different.\r\n\r\nAnyone know what font this is?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_6204.jpg]"
