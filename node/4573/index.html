It could be thought of as a separate design, except that without Helvetica, it would not exist or have any reason to exist.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Something I just discovered about URW's Nimbus Sans: it's actually closer to the display version of Helvetica, which Mark brought up in an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->old thread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, than either the original Linotype digitization or Lino's Helvetica Neue. Notice how the bold weight is slightly lighter and how, partially as a consequence of this, the counters on the 'a' seem wider. (This is more like the version of Helvetica you see on things like NYC subway entrances and old Lego boxes from the '70s and '80s.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I didnt realise this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am currently trying to obtain type specimen sheets of the phototype clones of Helvetica. So far I have been able to find Megaron, but no luck on the others. Do any of you know particularly where I could obtain them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the things I observed is that URW's Nimbus Sans D has a smaller x-height, as a result it has a lighter tonal weight to it.

		<div class="commentbody">URW seems to have digitized at least 4 (!) different optical sizes of Helvetica, along with Helvetica Neue. (Here I'm talking about the Bold, since that's the weight I can remember seeing most in display type.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nimbus Sans T: This one is more like the Linotype digitizations I posted here, with heavier stroke weight and more dramatic curves on the 'R' and 'a'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nimbus Sans D: Intended for display &ndash; this is what I used to make the sample. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nimbus Sans P: The P is for Poster. Intended for even larger sizes! Looks like the glyphs are thinner still, and spaced more closely together by default. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nimbus Sans L: Not sure what this is meant for, but it seems to resemble the text faces more than the display faces. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think these are all based on the pre-Helvetica Neue designs, because in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->addition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to this, URW also has many of the same optical variations of &quot;Nimbus Sans Novus&quot;, which presumably is a digitization of Helvetica Neue (and has SC/OsF!?!). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Though I don't have a type designer's eye to tell you if these faces are well-digitized*, I am really liking the robustness of the Nimbus Sans family. Has any other foundry done this with their Helvetica equivalent? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* One weird thing with URW fonts, is that URW will (or at least would, at a time) provide the outlines to different licensees in their Ikarus format, and they can do things like alter the curves (maybe), metrics, kerning, hinting, etc. (definitely) in the process of generating T1's, so not all URW digital fonts you get are equal, especially if they came bundled with something else!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Metadox, thanks for pointing out the various versions of Nimbus Sans. I had not looked at it very closely before, assuming it to be similar to the rest. I'm especially surprised to see that URW did the display versions, which match the old display versions of Helvetica.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you point out, the display versions of Helvetica were distinctly different from the text versions (which are what nearly all of the digital versions&ndash;clones or not&ndash;are based on). It's too bad Linotype has not released such a version. Helvetica Neue is fine, but the old display version has some merits, especially for anyone trying to capture the look that made it so popular in the '60s and '70s. The text versions (or even Neue) don't do it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've often wondered why Linotype has never done a display version of Helvetica, and now I think I know why. In metal, the display version was only available from Haas, and all the &quot;cold&quot; display type (film fonts, rub downs, etc.) got their Helvetica from Haas, not Linotype. Linotype was traditionally a machine composition system used mainly for text even when they went to phototype. Linofilm Helvetica only went up to 36 point. Looking at it in one of my old specimen books, it looks exactly like Linotype's digital version. The Linotype metal version only went up to 14 point. So, that may be why Linotype has never released the display version&ndash;they never had it in the first place.</div>

It was first published in the '70s. The list I compiled (above) is mainly from this book, which has several pages of specimens set from different manufacturers' equipment.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One caveat: The book has been updated, and the copy I have is one of the older editions. I don't know for sure if this section is in the current edition (after all, nobody uses phototypesetting machines anymore). Perhaps someone else here can confirm this. Otherwise, I would recommend getting it from a bookstore or library so you can examine the book and make sure the specimen pages are in it.</div>
