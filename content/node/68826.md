  body: I think it would read better as a J if you put a cross-bar on top.  Whenever
    I have to do a monogram I just use Bickham script, type the letters and a few
    ornaments, expand them and try and join them together somehow.  Some letters are
    easier than others - J is one of the hard ones!

  body: That's more attractive, but I don't think I'd ever get "JD" out of it. :-(
    Almost looks like "LS" to me.

  body: "The last one is the only one that, to my eyes, doesn't comprise a S.\r\nBut,
    unfortunately, J still has lot of T about it.\r\nWith a tricky letter such J,
    I think you should clearly show the descender, instead of trying to incorporate
    it.\r\nHave you tried to modify your 6.46am one transforming the leftmost curl
    in the J's descender?\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Riccardo, I tried that, but it completely throws off the balance.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes,
    I supposed that. But maybe going for a more upright style?\r\nAs for your last
    version, I think it could work with a crossbar."

  body: I think the tail of the J needs to drop down below the D - also perhaps vertically
    flip the top of the J that you had earlier, the three versions that you had tried,
    so that the curl is facing down instead of up.

  body: "I don't think you suck at this, your forms look good to me. I did this sketch
    to show how you might want to heavy up your shades (thick parts of the letters).
    Heavier shades will define the letters more and differentiate from swashes.\r\n\r\nI
    know you're trying to combine the two letters so it's all one continual stroke,
    but that may be what is preventing the J from really standing out. If you want
    the design to be all one stroke, make sure that the transition from one character
    to the next is thin... any thickness will be confusing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've made
    the J stem and the D share the same double stroke... why not let them really echo
    each other?  Like they're dancing... let them hold each other close. Just my two
    cents for what it's worth. I know you'll end up with a great design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JD_4120.jpg]"

  body: "I agree with TypeSEtit, you need to add weight to your where your stems would
    be. Also, I would consider experimenting with a cursive \"J\", one with an upper
    and lower loop. I think you could make some nice vertical rhythm. Even for the
    fanciest of uses, such as wedding invites, I think there is room for completely
    straight portions, it adds a degree of variety that just makes the whole thing
    look more elegant when balanced nicely. Imho a fully curved monogram tends to
    be too flourishy, too decorative.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the rough comps, just trying
    to provide my train of though.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jd_6520.png]"
