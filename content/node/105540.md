  of two different fonts but I'm not sure it may just be the weight of the characters
  themselves that make it look like it's two different fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso some of
  the terminals seem to have a slight serif almost like a Cooper black terminal only
  not so extreme.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DekaLogo_3671.jpg]"

    was done by hand...

    body: I'm not sure, the bowls of the D and A are almost the same and the curved
      terminals of the A and the E are close in curvature. The only thing that looks
      clumsy to me is the K with it's weird leg.
