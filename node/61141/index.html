  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am considering removing the following glyphs from the character sets of fonts that I produce in the future (or not designing them at all for fonts I design in the future):</p>
<ol>
<li>Aringacute (U+01FA)</li>
<li>AEacute (U+01FC)</li>
<li>Oslashacute (U+01FE)</li>
<li>aringacute (U+01FB)</li>
<li>aeacute (U+01FD)</li>
<li>oslashacute (U+01FF)</li>
<li>dotlessj (U+0237)</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the dotlessj, I had heard that the other glyphs were for Danish, but that they are not used in contemporary, written Danish. Can anyone point to references where they are used?</p>
<p>Are any of these glyphs used in any other languages? If not, I do not feel that it is necessary to include them in standard character sets any further, as least as far as fonts that I produce go. I am not sure if their being in older character sets or in other fonts' character sets (from e.g., Microsoft? Adobe?) is a convincing enough argument. What do you think?</p>

I tried to get to the bottom of this one some years ago. The thing is that you have to call The Danish Language Council to get the info. The woman that was present at a conference in Iceland many years ago, where these lists were made, works there. The list I&rsquo;m talking about is the one from Evertype [[http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/danish.pdf]]. When I called she was on vacation, and then I moved out of the country. Try calling them and ask on +45 35 32 89 90. Office hours are mon-thur 10-12, and Friday 9.30-12.30. Let me know what they say. I have a feeling that those characters are redundant in Danish. I can&rsquo;t find any references of use in the Danish corpus [[http://ordnet.dk/ods/]].</div>

But I do think that some of these oddball characters raise an important issue that keeps coming up in conversations: font bloat. Why are font designers creating so many fonts with huge character sets to support languages we know nothing about? Are native speakers in northern, central, and eastern Europe using fonts from the US and Western Europe, or do they laugh at our wacky diacriticals and odd spacing?</div>

<p>Note: positioning of combining diacritics over bases is a GPOS anchor attachment lookup, not kerning. Kerning affects the position of all subsequent glyphs, while anchor attachment is mark-specific.</p>
<p>The value of supporting dotless variants of soft-dotted letters and combining marks depends on the target languages. There are lots of languages in the world that rely on such mechanisms, because Unicode only includes precomposed diacritic letters for backwards compatibility. In effect, this means that only major languages that were supported in pre-Unicode charsets get precomposed diacritics: everyone else relies on combining marks.</p>
<p>My clients request such things, but then they tend to be either involved in internationalisation or in scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>One thing I do strongly recommend is to include Unicode combining mark character support for any accents used in precomposed glyphs in your font, not just the subset spacing accents (which are also backwards compatibility characters) and use the combining mark glyphs as components in composites. This has two benefits: it means that all your diacritic components can have shared x,y coordinates, rather than having different offsets with some components based on spacing diacritics and some on non-spacing, and it means that if you do decide to add GPOS anchor attachments you can use the component offsets to give you a head start.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; typesetter, yes, you need the base glyphs. All a typesetter can do is to laboriously make up the needed characters &ndash;  much as had to be done with a macron accent in the type 1 days.</p>
<p>At our shop, unless the occurrence of such characters is only once or twice in the job, we&rsquo;ll decline it if the designer insists on using a font where the EULA forbids modification. For fonts we can modify, our rule of thumb is the comps (both of them) are expected to make up such accented characters if they occur once or twice, otherwise, I&rsquo;ll make up the needed characters in the font, and write a ccmp feature if needed. It&rsquo;s all about what is fastest without leaving any little encoding or character lies in the final files.</p>

Since the ANSI Latin 1 &ndash; or a related codepage such as Windows CP 1252 &ndash; is the first building block of pretty much any Latin script font, this character should be included in most fonts.</p>
<p>If you want to be discretionary in your support of characters that are not part of 8-bit codepages, and disagree with e.g. some inclusions in the WGL4 list (which deliberately errs on the side of inclusion), that&rsquo;s fine. But I recommend against cutting characters that are part of 8-bit codepages, if your font is going to claim support of those codepages in the OS/2 table.</p>

Written Icelandic is virtually indistinguishable from Old Norse, though the pronunciation is quite different and the vocabulary is vastly increased, almost exclusively building on Norse roots, not by importing loanwords. There is a huge body of literature written in Old Norse, the Kings' sagas (including the great works of Snorri Sturluson) and the Icelanders' sagas probably the most read today. These are still printed in their original language or in bilingual versions. I own several of them. 
Old Norse is still taught in the Norwegian equivalent of high school (at least, it was when I attended).
There are several web pages containing Old Norse texts, most of them suffer for lack of proper glyph support.</p>

<p>I beg to differ with James: it can consume significant time to add a character to a typeface: upper case, lower case, small caps, all the weights, roman and italic&ndash;it adds up.</p>

<p>James (Puckett), I hear your pain! But CE and Eastern European language support is essential. Really, Cyrillic is too. These are languages and countries that cannot be ignored. The comparison with Old Norse is not apt. Of course, official Norwegian, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish, etc., are 100% essential to support. As are the official languages of all other European countries. But archaic, unofficial languages are another matter. Of course, we&rsquo;d be happy to build in special support to any of our fonts if a customer would commission that. But I don&rsquo;t think that Old Norse (sorry, I don&rsquo;t want to pick on this language too much!) publishers represent a significant portion of our customer base.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just licensing to customers in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Russia, etc. It is licensing to companies down the street in Frankfurt who sell their products to consumers in those countries or do business there otherwise. I know that it might be a little different in New York, but we are long past the discussion-phase as far as these languages go. One can still decide not to support them at their peril, though.</p>

<p>In these the first six of your glyphs are relegated to the AL5 glyph set. The dotless j belongs to AL4 set, which is used for families with extensive language support on the scale of Arno &amp; Hypatia.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would approach the relevant linguistic institutes of larger universities, the more prestigious, the better, and tell them I can solve their transcription problems once and for all. Make a highbrow-looking type specimen, with complex texts set in languages relevant to them. Send it by ordinary mail. Give them a telephone call subsequently. If you at all can stand being a salesman.</p>
<p>When some prestigious language institutes all of a sudden starts publishing much better looking papers, word-of-mouth and academic envy will work its magic. Possibly.</p>

<p>The scholars generally won&rsquo;t buy them; they&rsquo;ll use Gentium. But the publishers do buy fonts, and they do take glyph coverage into account, as long as someone who knows typesetting has any say in the matter. For example, one publisher I&rsquo;ve worked for a fair amount chose Minion Pro for their house style several years ago, specifically because they need a well-integrated polytonic Greek for a lot of their books. The same logic applies to Scotch Modern, but it&rsquo;s also more distinctive.</p>

<p>Nick, yes, the Brill types will have full smallcaps, plus a range of different numeral styles, symbols for critical apparatus, fraktur, and a pile of other stuff either already used in Brill publications or anticipated. Also GPOS mark-to-base and mark-to-mark positioning for arbitrary diacritics.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be an optical size for footnotes, because the budget wasn&rsquo;t available, but Brill&rsquo;s standard footnote size is not very small. Their standard text is 11 cicero points and their notes and captions are 9 cicero points. So I&rsquo;m designing the type to work well at both sizes.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the scholastic market!
The primary (potential) scholastic market for fonts is not publishers, but educational institutions, and the scholars are faculty and students, who could buy (licence) the fonts they use, just as they or their institution buy the books they use.
A non-commercial licence of Brill fonts for students and faculty (assuming faculty are &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo;) would make Brill books a first-choice for mandatory text-books, but wouldn&rsquo;t Brill be ignoring a profit-centre in not charging for fonts?</p>
<p>This is difficult to think all the way through, but one would assume that other publishers will develop their own 6000-character non-commercial scholastic fonts, to stay in the game. If their fonts aren&rsquo;t as good as the Brill fonts, or are &ldquo;similar to&rdquo;, then scholars (and institutions) who haven&rsquo;t bought Brill books will be able to use superior quality Brill fonts and not buy Brill books.</p>
<p>How about bundling &ldquo;fonts on CD with book purchase&rdquo;? That would consolidate everyone&rsquo;s understanding of the fonts' dual function in textbook and in student work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I&rsquo;ll mention all these ideas as options when I meet with the Brill people later this year. Brill&rsquo;s idea in making fonts available to scholars would be a) to aid scholarship, something that they&rsquo;ve been doing in various ways for 325 years and b) to attract scholars to publish with Brill. Fonts on CD with book purchase adds a cost for Brill, and restricts legitimate use of the fonts in a way that Brill might not see as beneficial. Anyway, I think all ideas are on the table at this stage.</div>

<p>Actually, the Brill fonts prove the opposite. We (SIL) have a number of freely available fonts (Gentium and others) that do a reasonable job of meeting most scholars' need for linguistic Latin fonts. Brill took a good look at them, and decided that there were particular publishing needs that our fonts did not attempt to meet. So Brill decided to spend good money to hire an expert designer to spend months creating a new type family, and make them available to the publishing community. The existence of free fonts did not harm the market, but rather stimulated more commissioned work to fill in the existing gaps.</p>
<p>This is a benefit for everyone. Scholars get a wider variety of &lsquo;standard&rsquo; fonts to use for research and publishing. Brill gets great PR and goodwill, and very likely a richer base of authors. Typographers may get better-quality fonts to use when typesetting odd academic texts. Designers get more fonts to study as they try to figure out what rather odd letters are &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; to look like. Overall, the typographic quality of academic publications gets a boost.</p>
<p>Neither the Brill fonts, or ours, will meet all the needs. There will still be room for more work by professional designers. There may even be increased demand, as other publishers want to get into the game, and as the academic community grows in their appreciation for fine typography and fine type design.</p>
<p>I never used to spend money on beer - a result of growing up around mediocre American stuff. I didn&rsquo;t even like it when it was free at a party. After a few friends here in England bought me pints of English Real Ale, I got used to how good a beer could get, and now find myself making special visits to my favourite brewery. A free bit of the Good Stuff can develop a habit of paying for more of it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>The existence of free fonts did not harm the market, but rather stimulated more commissioned work to fill in the existing gaps.</em></p>
<p>I was referring to the market for fonts, not commissioned work.</p>
<p>The idea that flooding potential consumers with free product somehow stimulates the market is erroneous: while a small percentage of users may be interested enough to go out and buy something different than the bulk of their peers, it&rsquo;s a minority sale achieved at the cost of surrendering the bulk of the market. This situation may seem to benefit consumers, but it impoverishes content production in general, channelling it into the hands of a small group of commissioned workers who may be well paid, but undermining the potential greater income to be made from creative work by spreading it around. After all, you can&rsquo;t make money from something you don&rsquo;t own. The real money is in the mass market.</p>
<p>Do consumers benefit from the situation where content producers are not making mass sales? No, because they still have to pay for media, whether it be digital devices or internet access. So &ldquo;free&rdquo; digital product just shifts profit from the creative sector to the hardware sector (and that includes Internet access).</p>
<p>And ultimately, all consumers are content creators. So if, as a consumer, you play the game where you get free creative content, you are endorsing a system that restricts your ability to derive income from creative work.</p>
<p>Beyond that, creative work gets redefined, stripping its value, becoming craft and production work that is bought outright by manufacturers, rather than warranting &ldquo;points&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Those involved in scholarly publishing have been hearing that the sky is falling so long now that we cannot help but take new threats with a certain equanimity.  As for &ldquo;cheap and cutthroat&rdquo; competition, the usual strategy is to offer something better.  Of course, one of the things we all appreciate about the font John Hudson is working on is that it isn&rsquo;t cheap (assuming he isn&rsquo;t some weirdo &ldquo;ragged-trousered philanthropist&rdquo;).</p>
<p>As for John&rsquo;s work ever becoming a &ldquo;profit center&rdquo; for Brill, I have my doubts.  It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to suppose that Brill commissioned the font to simplify their production of scholarly material covering a very wide range of subject areas and languages (more subtle is the need control licensing for use in their on-line publications).  Limiting the font&rsquo;s free distribution to published authors isn&rsquo;t practical: authors of books and articles not yet written are just as deserving &ndash; and one hopes there will be sufficient scholarly &ldquo;competition&rdquo; so that poorer mss. can be rejected.  Bert Vanderveen has already referred to Brill&rsquo;s prices as limiting readership, and many with access to an institutional subscription forego a personal purchase, especially when on-line is so convenient: does Brill want to look like they&rsquo;re trying to squeeze something extra out of individuals already accustomed to reading for free?  I suspect they&rsquo;d rather enjoy the gratitude of having made a tool developed for their own benefit available to anyone interested (where most of that category is both a prospective customer and makes library recommendations).</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the current economic situation.  But even here, beer offers us hope: according to this morning&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112164683">National Public Radio</a>, here in the U.S. craft beer (less than 2 million barrels per annum) is doing better despite the downturn.  Anheuser-Busch may control much of the market, but there is room for competition based on quality.</p>

<p>There are plenty of economic benefits to a company like Brill commissioning its own typeface at this time, in terms of simplifying the author-editor-production workflow, standardising on Unicode text processing, etc. The new type is also more space efficient than the Baskerville they have been using for a long time, and based on testing to date we gain a line or two per page, which over the length of a book, size of a print run and number of books they publish every year will reduce their paper costs per annum. I suspect the folks at Brill who approved the project have a pretty good idea of how long it will take to pay for itself.</p>

<p>This seems to assume that the retail font licensing market is naturally the central business of type, and hence something that marginalises this market is a distortion. I&rsquo;d counter that the retail market as we know it is a recent phenomenon, invented in the latter 20th century during the phototype period. Prior to that, the manufacturing costs led to a closer balance of custom and off-the-shelf type purchase, with even the latter necessarily calculated as an investment cost for most customers. I make my living designing custom typefaces. I don&rsquo;t engage in the retail market at all, and I make no apologies about that: I reject the notion that there is something normal or preferred in the retailing of fonts, or that this market deserves some kind of protection.</p>

<p>I was comparing revenue from the volume retail sale of pre-designed fonts with revenue from custom work for single clients.
In that sense, font retailing has been going on a long time, as founders sold their type to printers in the days of letterpress.</p>
<p><em>I reject the notion that there is something normal or preferred in the retailing of fonts, </em></p>
<p>I agree, I don&rsquo;t think either custom or retail work is more normal or preferred. BTW, I make a significant part of my living from custom work.</p>

<p>Plenty of fonts suitable for English text are available free or bundled, and that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have killed the market for retail font licensing. The market is relatively small, but then it always has been: the people who actually spend money on fonts are professional designers, typographers and publishers. Personally, I think cross-licensing and the subsequent commodification of retail <em>pricing</em> had a much greater impact than bundling. Small foundries are not competing in the retail market against the availability of free and bundled non-retail fonts: they&rsquo;re competing against companies with large libraries flogging each others fonts for peanuts.</p>
<p>Is there a viable scholarly market for retail font licensing, i.e. is there a sufficient paying market to cover the costs of developing specialised fonts? I&rsquo;m not sure that there is. Certainly, a company like Brill &ndash; which is hardly a ‘large corportation’, Nick &ndash; finds itself in need of commissioning custom types precisely because no off-the-shelf fonts support everything that they need to support. Having made the decision to invest a large sum of money in custom font development, you can hardly blame them for looking at ways in which to maximise the benefits of that investment. That said, I&rsquo;m happy to raise your concerns when I go to Leiden in November and discuss plans for the fonts with Brill&rsquo;s director.</p>

<p>As someone who works with classical scholars, I think I can say that the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. There might be an odd individual here or there who has enough publishing or design background to care about fonts, but for the most part if Gentium or Cardo is out there for free, they see no reason to pay for Arno Pro or the Modern Suite. They use Word, not InDesign, and they use whatever fonts came installed on their system, except when they need special glyphs (thus Cardo, for example). Classical scholars, and university departments of classics, and especially classics students, tend not to have very much money. They&rsquo;ll spend it on books first, and considering how much books from Brill cost, there won&rsquo;t be any money left over for fonts ;)</p>
