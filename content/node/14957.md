  body: I don't know, but the fact that the two e's are different suggests that it
    isn't font at all.

    font \"e\" and that the whole thing was slightly skewed and manipulated (Photoshop?).
    \ That might account for the differing cap sizes between the \"D\" and \"S\"...
    just a guess.\r\n"
