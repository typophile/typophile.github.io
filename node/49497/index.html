  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>Desperate is not a strong enough word to describe my present situation. With all the projects I should be working on, the last thing I wanted was to spend my morning trying to locate my fonts!</p>
<p>So here is what happened. I while ago I installed FontExplorerX for Windows (I run XP). I figured it would help me finally organize my fonts. So I ran the program and it seemed to &ldquo;index&rdquo; all my fonts from my default font folder (in the Control Panel). It created a folder for each (!) font file and placed them in a larger folder. Now, when you look in  the Control Panel font folder, all the fonts appear to be shortcuts to the new location of the font file.</p>
<p>Anyway, the program would not install properly. It would jam during the installation. I tried to repeat the process, but the same happened. What I&rsquo;m trying to do right now is simply move all my font files back to the default folder, because I&rsquo;ve been noticing that some fonts appear to be missing. Today I opened up a file I was working on yesterday and a missing font window appeared! Everything was fine yesterday!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering what to do next. The only way I can think of is copy all the font files from the FontExplorerX folder (this means going through hundreds of folders) to a separate folder, deleting the shortcuts in my default font folder, and then pasting the copied files back to the default.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other solutions? Or is my solution flawed? Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I&rsquo;d really appreciate your help. Thank you.</p>
<p>Dan</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The same thing happened to me. I was really keen to try/use FontExplorerX (because I&rsquo;m really quite desperately in need of some way to manage fonts, and the consensus seems to be that this will be the best option). The installation seemed to work, but in the same way that you describe, the program itself wouldn&rsquo;t run. To get my fonts back, I had to go through all those folders and copy everything back manually; there are few that still seem to be missing, but I replace things as I find out about them.</p>
<p>That answer&rsquo;s not much help, I realise, unless it&rsquo;s any consolation to know you&rsquo;re not alone..</p>

<p>FontExplorer X for Windows was a public beta. Unlike some public betas, it was really not ready for general use.</p>
<p>ATM Deluxe has a pretty primitive UI, and not a lot of features. But it is really very stable. As long as you don&rsquo;t object to using an unsupported product, and to turning off User Account Control if you&rsquo;re on Vista&hellip;.</p>

Should you do so, everything in your font list from that folder and below will disappear. The only way to fix the problem is to delete the font database and start over. This was a lesson I learned the hard way.</p>
<p>That being said, the program is indeed rock-solid and I use it to this day on my Windows machines.</p>

I had never heard of ATM. I will give it a try (after I recover all my fonts!).</p>
<p>@Thomas
As you point out it was &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and I understood the risk. But crashing repeatedly in during the installation? I did not expect that. Maybe a short word of caution for should have been included on the download page. I read their &ldquo;known issues&rdquo; file, but could not find anything relevant to my situation.</p>

Thanks for your instructions and advice.</p>
