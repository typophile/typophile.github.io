body: The &#34;Playa Linda&#34; portion of this image is the font in question. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ve tried WhatTheFont and Identifont, but since there&#39;s not much to
  go by, the results were poop.  Any pointers are greatly appreciated.  Thanks! <BR>

  body: That font gives freeware a bad name. Its worse than bad. Contact the client
    and offer a redesign proposal and use professionally designed fonts.
