  some fonts that are similar to Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk and Myriad Pro. \r\n\r\nBasically
  I need to pair a sans serif with a serif typeface... similar to what RealSimple
  magazine does.. they paired a sans serif with Caecilia.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/homepage/flash/0,23022,,00.shtml"

  body: ">similar to Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk\r\nLinotype offers \xBBBasic Commercial\xAB
    as a similar. Okay, less weights etc.\r\nMaybe you find a Bitstream Knock-Off
    of AG \u2026 search Corel Draw for that:)\r\n\r\n>Myriad Pro\r\nTake Myriad Pro
    ;)\r\n\r\n>they paired a (sans) serif with \u2026\r\nif you want that \xBBworking
    within the same line\xAB check:\r\nx-height, weight(s), the form of the glyphs,
    spacing, the \xBBvibe\xAB \u2026 and more\r\n\r\nBTW I saw PMN Caecilia working
    good together with FF DIN \u2026\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n"
