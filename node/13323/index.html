  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was just reading Designing Typefaces by David Earls. In the preface, he mentions how "Social issues continue to affect typography" and he mentions the case of "wholesale replacement of alphabets, as seen in recent years in Azerbaijan". I was curious about this information (and uninformed) so I went and did some research. (Now I realize, there may be an old thread on this since this is an old topic). But I was suprised to learn that the Azerbaijani alphabet has been entirely altered four times: from Arabic to Latin to Cyrillic and now back to Latin again. Each of these changes was politically motivated. 

If we consider that each alphabet has its roots in its own specific culture, is born from social and economic change, then how can such a distinct and culture be forced to use another culture's alphabet system? (Now, I do realize that one of the criticisms of the original Arabic letters was that they did not fully represent all of the vowels sounds, and maybe I am being naive here, but shouldn't a culture be allowed to express itself with its own proper alphabet?)

Comments please!</div>

The short answer?
<em>If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent
    the enemy from engaging us even though the lines
    of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. 
    All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable
    in his way.</em>

I believe politicos preaching what is right and proper has more to do with domination than advancing a culture.

		<div class="commentbody">Most of the people on the planet use 'someone else's writing system'. The number of writing systems on the planet is considerably smaller than the number of linguistic and ethnic communities. Peoples borrow, adapt and share writing systems across language and cultural boundaries. Only a small number of cultures have the privilege to still be using an indigenous writing system. Of course, many peoples have been using an adopted writing system for so many centuries that it has become part of their own culture in a real sense. They have made it their own through their literature, calligraphy, epigraphy, etc.

Azeri has the same historical issues with writing systems as the other Turkic languages. The earliest and only indigenous Turkic writing system was the Central Asian runic script, which was replaced by the Arabic script when the Turks converted to Islam. So the Arabic script is no more 'authentic' for the Turkic languages than the Cyrillic or Latin, except insofar as religion is less transitory than politics and more deeply embedded in most cultures.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I mostly agree with John. I would however offer these elaborations:
1) A script change can be forced from the outside, or it can be homegrown. I think we can agree that the former is usually bad, and the latter usually OK. On the other hand, it's certainly possible -as is the case with the latest Azeri switch in fact- for a change to be motivated by misguided intentions, and badly carried out.
2) Some cultures put more value on their script. It's probable that Azeris don't mind switching nearly as much as Armenians for example would, since for us it's a very strong part of our identity. The Soviets didn't even have the balls to mess with it (although they <strong>did</strong> mess with our spelling).
3) Languages and scripts have varying degrees of compatibility. It can be argued that Latin is a better fit for Altaic languages than Arabic is.

		<div class="commentbody">In reference to Hrant first point:

I think the most recent Azeri script switch needs to be seen in two contexts: the immediate political context, to which Hrant alludes, of wising to build stronger ties with Turkey and, through Turkey, with 'the West', but also in the historical context of the 1920s Latin script adoption which was, by all accounts, popular. This historical context is really the more interesting one, because it has to do with an internal historical dialogue: the re-emergence of Azerbaijani national identity in the post-Soviet period is explicitly linked to the brief period between the end of Ottoman domination and the enforced use of the Cyrillic script under Stalin. So the period in which they first adopted the Latin alphabet -- along with other Turkic peoples --, in the 1920s, is seen as the period of the birth of the modern nation of Azerbaijan. I think this internal motivation is probably much stronger than the contemporary political agenda, although they are obviously linked through the much longer political orientation that began with Ataturk's adoption of the Latin script and the development of the pan-Turkic alphabet in the 1920s.</div>
