body: "My dream is to be a lettering artist for Hallmark Cards. Unfortunatly that
  is all that it will be. Just a dream. My family does not want to relocate to Kansas
  and I am not even sure if Hallmark would even hire me. So I guess I will have to
  go after more realistic goals which is to become a fulltime lettering artist and
  Typeface designer. I designed this new typeface called \u201CEnchanted\u201D which
  is my tip of the hat to all of the lettering artists past and present at Hallmark.
  I sent it out to FontBros, myfonts.com, Veer and also Fonts.com. Hopefully Fontshop
  will pick it up also. I talked with Stuart Sandler and he should have it maybe up
  by tomorrow at FontBros.com :) It has seven alternates also. The word \u201CThanksgiving\u201D
  in the samples shows the alternate k and g.\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays\r\n\r\n-Charles

    prospect! i'm sure you know of Mary Englebreit, she always wanted to be a card
    designer and just wouldn't take no for an answer: now she runs a small media empire
    (nothing near MS, mind you, but she's not doing so bad for herself, i'm sure)."

  body: "Charles,\r\n\r\nHave you contacted Hallmark at all, to inquire about employment?
    I don't think you can assume out of hand that they would require you to relocate.
    Better to make the inquiry; there is a lot of work that is done remotely, since
    high-quality scans, bezier versions and fonts are all easily transferred digitally.
    \r\n\r\nI ask this because your work is excellent, and there is no reason you
    should not be considered seriously by Hallmark, or by other greetings companies.\r\n\r\nWhich
    would leave you with more regret: never trying to realize your dream, or realizing
    it? "

    agree with Carl \u2014 nothing ventured, nothing gained.\r\n\r\nPretty sure Stuart
    has a few connections with a few former Hallmark people, too.\r\nIt's worth asking.
