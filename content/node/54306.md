  looking for a friendly sans for display purposes. I will be using it at fairly large
  sizes with sIFR. \r\n\r\nTwo typefaces I like are Bree (Type-together) and Bryant
  Condensed (Process). \r\n\r\nHere are a couple of other requirements:\r\n-Romanian
  language support\r\n-Affordable (no budget, my expense)\r\n-Open-type (if possible,
  not that important)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nDan"

    dated and overused. I also don't know if it has the language support you need.\r\n\r\n"

    think Bree is a very nice, open sans. Very friendly looking. Is this a camp for
    youths?"

    I''m a little hesitant. I''m afraid it''s a bit too "happy". '

  body: 'I need it to harmonize with the design I planned for the website. It will
    be sitting next to different illustrations and set in large sizes, so if it has
    too much character, I think it might attract to much attention. '

  body: Try Capricorn Combi from Fontshop. The uppercase-only could look great for
    display titling. The font is very manly looking, but with some great attactive
    flair.

    informality but overall its not an overpowering display face. [[http://www.pack3153.org|Here''s
    an example]] where I  used it for my local cub scouts. '

    As for Knockout, H&FJ don''t seem to offer single weights. '
