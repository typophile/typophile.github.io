  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all

I don't know if I will express myself well about this.

The question is, I'm using image/text placeholders on masters pages, that I used to place contents in the document pages. I supposed this way I would be able to move the contents later using that frames placed in the masters. Until now is working fine and I can move things around controlling them from the master pages frames.

The problem comes when I add or move pages in the document, and the links between the page contents and master frames get broken.
I'm using facing pages layout, and it seems to me that if i had started working with single pages layout this problem wouldn't occur.

I've been reading some tutorials but couldn't find any answer on this.

Hope someone understands what I'm saying

Any help will be much appreciated
Regards

Sorry, that is not a question. :-D

What is it, a book/brochure? In that case, facing pages is definitely the way to go.
You can also have facing <strong>master</strong> pages, with different settings for the left and right page. Is that what you’re loking for?

Not sure,

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, kiko, I'm not sure I understand... However, I do know that the facing pages option can cause problems when you add pages to your document. It's probably better to turn that option off for the job you're working on.

Maybe you can modify your current master pages so that you don't lose the work you've done so far.</div>

ups, maybe should have said "the thing is..." or "what's happening is..", Sorry ;)

It's a catalog with around 80 pages with images.
Yes, I'm using facing pages, and facing masters too, which only differ on the left and right header title. I placed graphic frame placeholders in both left and right pages of a master, that I used to place content (images) in the document pages. All works fine and I can move things on that master with exact results in the pages assign by it. The problem comes when I move or add another page, then the page graphics (images) get detached from the master frame placeholders, and I'm no longer able to control them from the masters.

Sorry, sometimes its hard to explain something (when for someone, sometimes it's not even a problem) when not speaking my mother language.

Thanks for trying to help

		<div class="commentbody">Kiko, I think I understand the problem, but I'm not sure I have the solution. The frames on pages lose the links to their corresponding Master frames when the page moves, due to adding or moving pages. 

I believe it only happens if, in the process of adjusting pages, any given page moves from being a Right to being a Left (or vice versa), even if only for a moment while other pages are being moved or added. Are you moving/adding in complete spreads only?

I think the solution may have to do with *disabling* the Allow Pages to Shuffle command in the Pages palette. This makes it so that Right cannot become Left or vice-versa. And I think it will prevent your problem from happening. Just be sure you don't end up with single, floating pages in the middle of your booklet.

On the other hand, if you're changing a Right to a Left, or a Left to a Right, on purpose, then there's no solution, as it will then always break from the Master.

<cite>Are you moving/adding in complete spreads only?</cite>

If i understand what you're asking, no, I'm moving/adding pages individually not in complete spreads.

<cite>I believe it only happens if, in the process of adjusting pages, any given page moves from being a Right to being a Left (or vice versa)</cite>

It seemed to my this was exactly what was causing the lose links.

Yes, it makes sense. I believe that is what was happening here. I'll definitely try out your tip on disabling the "Allow Pages to Shuffle command". 
Unfortunately, I'm not in my computer right now, so I'll have to try it out latter.

Thanks a lot for your help, and patience on trying to understand my problem.

Best regards </div>

Apparently there are only two ways for managing this: one is adding pages in pairs only or moving complete spreads, the other way is disabling the "allow pages to shuffle" with the disadvantages of risking to get single pages floating in the document, as you said.
