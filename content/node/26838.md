body: Just a reminder, in case you don&#39;t already know. The San Francisco Center
  for the Book is presenting a symposium at CCA this Saturday, Sept. 20, to coincide
  with its current exhibition of French design legend Massin&#39;s work. <BR> <BR>I
  posted a press release here on Typophile in the News &amp; Events section. Starts
  at 2pm at CCA. Reception at SFCB to follow the talks. Free event, open to the public.  <BR>
  <BR>SOTA&#39;s a proud sponsor <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I won&#39;t be able to make it, but I hope to hear reports
  from any locals who can attend. Should be another great event. Go to the SFCB website
  at <a href="http://www.sfcb.org" target="_blank">http://www.sfcb.org</a> to get
  more details.
