body: "I have recently seen several references to grids involved with t-shirts and
  magazines layout. I know there is an option for grids in Photoshop, but never really
  heard how they are used. I have always composed by eyeballing it (and this may be
  obvious to grid afficianados).\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a resource that would explaing
  the basic use of grids in design?\r\n\r\nAnd when composing inside an image where
  the image dictates where some things have to go, are grids still useful?\r\nThanks."

    in the usefulness of this book. And the link showed what other books were bought
    by people who also bought that book. This led to a couple other interesting books,
    including one by Bringhurst, which I keep seeing people cite from.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking
    With Type\" looks good too. Maybe one of these days I can say \"I kinda know what
    I'm doing\"\r\n"

    used for images and image manipulation. For design, especially something like
    a magazine, you should be using Quark or Indesign, not photoshop.\r\n\r\nYou should
    also familiarize yourself with guides so you don't have to be eyeballing anything.
    This applies to p-shop and Illustrator as well as Quark and Indy."

    Kind of like magic. \r\n\r\nAll I ever design are fontplays. The magazines I do
    are just imaginary ones to display a font. It doesn't seem worth buying and learning
    all the expensive programs real designers use. "

  body: "> How do you test your fonts without real software :(\r\n\r\nWith some fonts,
    you don't have to do much to find out they are screwed up. Sometimes I consider
    it a challenge to make it display nicely (faking real quotes, or maybe kerning
    a little bit). But if it is too bad, it gets the boot. There are plenty more where
    they came from.\r\n\r\n> If you are serious about working with fonts you really
    need to work with design software.\r\n\r\nMaybe someday. I suppose it would be
    nice if I got good enough that foundries would start sending me some of their
    fonts to play with and feature on my site. A three relatively small ones already
    do, although I was a customer first. Someday I will probably start a commercial
    section, so I can play with more fonts that have fewer surprises.\r\n\r\nRight
    now I have almost 20,000 IP addresses making over 4,500,000 hits a month, mostly
    for the free photos. At some point I am hoping I have enough traffic that someone
    that sells fonts and images, will also let me feature their images for a link
    to their site. I see some pretty cool photos in some of the magazines that somehow
    find their way to me in the mail. (I think Adobe may give away addresses).\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I'm an old dog, but I can still learn a new trick if I'm dragged kicking and screaming.\r\n:
