  body: Will have to try that next time, thanks. What happened to the search by keyword
    feature on Fontshop? I thought I used it but now it&#39;s not there anymore.

  body: 'Plus Sans and relay are the closest match so far but not the type i need.
    Look for the pointed A&#39;s. <BR> <BR>James Gareth, Plus Sans is almost there
    if we look at the P&#39;s and R&#39;s but again it doesn&#39;t have the right
    A&#39;s. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not customized, it&#39;s not only a logo
    it&#39;s also the title type they use throughout the newspaper, and i doubt La
    Presse would have gone for a custon font. <BR> <BR>thanks for the input keep checking
    if you can spare the time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: How about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/mercury/bold/testdrive.html?s=LA+PRESSE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Mercury Bold</a>, with a stroke added, and possibly extended a
    bit? <BR> <BR>If you compare its characters to both the La Presse headliner as
    well as the sample newspage on the left side of your website, it matches up pretty
    well.

    But it is not an exact match. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=LL51818"

  body: Ugo, many companies have custom logos or have customized commercially available
    fonts for corporate use, I don&#39;t see why La Presse woundn&#39;t. Customizing
    the &#34;A&#34; and the &#34;S&#34;es of Plus Sans can be done in no time. I&#39;m
    not saying that there isn&#39;t a font that exactly matches out there, I&#39;m
    simply suggesting that&#39;s what could have been done and often is in the corporate
    world.

    I really appreciate! <BR> <BR>James i have no clue why i thought that they probably
    dont have a custom font with the results you all presented, i believe you must
    definately be right. <BR> <BR>If i get to find the exact font i&#39;ll let you
    know <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
