  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello to all members. <BR>My first post here. Discovered this forum just a week ago and I&#39;m already hooked to it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been asked to design a magazine for a local newspaper. The content of this special issue will be about companies that have succeeded in business through the added value of design in their products. &#40;Mainly industrial design, but also graphic, packaging, etc&#41; <BR>My intention is to show also that the use of good typography can improve a lot the readability and the user experience. <BR>I need a good combination of fonts for body text and headlines. Till now I&#39;ve been using Rotis Semiserif for headlines and Univers Condensed for body text &#40;I know is a bit weird but they give me always a LOT of text to fit in every page, and is the only way to deal with that&#41; <BR>I don&#39;t want to do like other &#34;design&#34; magazines that put unreadable microtext in futuristic fonts. I want to use some modern looking fonts but they must be readable... and affordable for a small studio too :-&#41;  so please don&#39;t say the one that I&#39;d love to try but I cannot afford. <BR>If I find a nice combination that reflects this, it&#39;s even possible that we can write an article explaining that to illustrate the whole process. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your kind answers, <BR>Vicente</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice icon. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s great that you&#39;re concerned a lot with readability, but remember that this special issue is specifically about Design - so I think your display font at least should be &#34;self-conscious&#34; in this respect. The trick will be finding a text font that has &#34;attitude&#34; but remains very readable. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m partial to wedge-serif fonts, and the other day I saw a magazine cover using Alias&#39;s Key really well. For a text companion to that you could choose a bunch of things, like Swift or FF Olson. Whitman might be nice too although I think it&#39;s a bit too &#34;soft-spoken&#34; for this, I think. <BR> <BR>BTW, narrowness isn&#39;t always more economical, because a wider font can be set smaller while looking the same size as a larger narrow font. It depends a lot on your column width and frequency of linebreaks. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the info Hrant! <BR> <BR>Finally found Key in Veers webpage. Seems a nice choice, only concern would be about its width. Do you think it can be a problem? <BR> <BR>Swift it&#39;s a nice font. But too expensive for this project and maybe I&#39;d never take real benefit of it &#40;Hey, I&#39;m sure that it deserves its price&#41;. <BR> <BR>Following the style you suggested, I discovered Corel&#39;s Humanist 712 Slabserif BT in my vault. Do you think that can substitute Olsen? Or maybe it loses the &#34;swifted&#34; serifs that make Olsen better for this application? <BR> <BR>All the best <BR>Vicente <BR> <BR> <BR>PS Any chance you send me a scan of this cover magazine, so we can get inspired for using Key typeface?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; only concern would be about its width. <BR> <BR>I guess it can be a problem sometimes - but I have virtually no experience <i>using</i> fonts so I&#39;m not sure. Maybe James &#40;Montalbano&#41; can help. <BR> <BR>&#62;  Humanist 712 <BR> <BR>That might be a good compromise, although it&#39;s kind of a &#34;hybrid&#34; slab. Some people might feel its retro vibe, but that can be good too these days. But anyway, don&#39;t choose a slab/wedge font because <i><b>I</b></i> like it. If you decide to go with Key however it does make sense. <BR> <BR>&#62; send me a scan <BR> <BR>Hey, I try to limit my purchase of magazines that I&#39;m <i>interested</i> in, much less something that just has a nice cover! :-&#41;  But I&#39;ll try to find what magazine it was so you can track it down. I do remember that Key was used to set the name of the magazine, and it was a short name, with a &#34;k&#34; in it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
