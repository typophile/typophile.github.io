  in the image below is the correct one that had been used to write \"viz.\" before
  people started to substitute \"z\" for it? And if so, do you think using this archaic
  form would be a good idea (in a bit old-fashioned philosophical journal)? Or do
  you think it would just look weird? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/viz_6068.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nNolmendil\r\n"

    scribe -- and later, typefounder -- decided to render it. There is no one correct
    form. Long ago, I once spent an entire afternoon finding samples to show a client,
    who felt the one we used was somehow \"wrong\" (I used one with a descender).\r\n\r\nSee
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tironian_et  \r\n\r\nAs for using it in a philosophical
    journal in the context you suggest, yes, it would look weird. Not to mention causing
    the typesetter trouble... "

  body: I'm not certain that the form would be correct. Viz. is the standard abbreviation
    for <em>videlicitur</em>, "see also"; the word "and" isn't a part of the abbreviated
    word.

    body: It is the abbreviation of "videlicet", which means roughly "namely"; and
      the final glyph is tironian shorthand for the final "et", as an ending, not
      meaning "and" here. Some of these shorthnds were regularly used in print as
      long as 16th or even 17th century.
