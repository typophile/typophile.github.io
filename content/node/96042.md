body: There is the ITC Galliard that's sold by Adobe etc, and the Galliard BT from
  Bitstream....There are some kerning differences, for example in the ITC Galliard
  the small letter "rv" combo touch each other, where in the Bitstream "rv" lettering
  combo they do not....So i was curious which version is the "original"?

    was one of Bitstream's founders and probably supervised its digitization. The
    Linotype/Adobe version has also been criticized for the spacing in the italics.
    (I wish I could remember where I saw that, but it was a long time ago.)\r\n\r\nCarter
    & Cone (Carter's current company) also has a version. It's full-featured, but
    it lacks the bolder weights, and looks like it's only available in PostScript
    Type 1 format.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/carter_and_cone/itc_galliard_cc/"

    that I have from Adobe has an \u2018rv\u2019 kern pair of 53, pushing them clearly
    apart. In contrast, the ITC Galliard CC from Carter & Cone has an \u2018rv\u2019
    kern pair of -16, allowing them to touch. (Note: the native fitting is different
    between the two versions as well.) I don\u2019t have the Bitstream version, but
    I would expect it to reflect the thinking of the C&C version, for the reasons
    Mark explained.\r\n\r\nThe \u201Coriginal\u201D would actually be Mergenthaler
    Linotype Galliard for phototype composition, released in 1978, before ITC acquired
    the licensing rights (in 1981). \r\n\r\nBut, in terms of digitizations, the Bitstream
    and CC versions hew more closely to the original Mergenthaler drawings than the
    Adobe version, which contains some modifications done during the early days of
    Postscript. "

    body: I am sure about the rv kerning, at least for me....The top right of the
      r and the top left of the v touch for the ITC version, and they do not for the
      BT version.....I have to blow the letters up real large to see though.
