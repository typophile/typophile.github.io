body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently spotted an issue with kerning in FL.\r\nIn metrics window
  all kerning works fine but when i generate \"kern\" feature some pairs among classes
  are excluded. But it is only visible in OT preview and later in exported file. What
  interesting is, when I change the order of the code, e.g. I bring the missing pair
  to the top of the code, it works. Anyway the whole thing behave very random and
  I can't get the logic of this. I was searching the problem but didn't found the
  exact answer.  Putting extra \"subtable\" doesn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nHope it
  sounds clear.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRad."

      to find all overlapping glyphs in classes, or I have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nThanks"

        tricky that this issue also appears when same glyph is putted in one class
        twice, it can be missed while coping and pasting. \r\n\r\nThat problem was
        quite haunting me, so thanks a lot one more time."
