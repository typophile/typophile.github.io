body: When creating a webpage, I specify an OpenType font that contains lining, ranging,
  and tabular numerals.  How could I most easily take advantage of the extra numerals?  Is
  there an HTML/CSS command to toggle numerals, or would i have to carefully translate
  individual numerals into Unicode (either by hand or with a webauthoring tool)?

    You can't assume your reader will have that font installed, or indeed any font
    with those extended characters defined. If it's just an experiment, I'm pretty
    sure that referring to numeral styles is outside the current capabilities of CSS.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that you could copy extended characters from say InDesign to Dreamweaver.
    It's a long time since I've used DW but I recall that it would automatically use
    Unicode encodings where it needed to."

    \ In my particular case, everyone's using Longhorn beta 1.\r\n\r\nUnicode: this
    would get messy.  Seems there are designated Unicode ranges for monospace numerals,
    but no Unicode ranges for ranging versus lining numerals.  Looking at a variety
    of fonts that happen to contain both ranging and lining numerals, there is no
    methodology for organizing these numerals - all fonts seems to be organized differently.
    \ So, to use any extra numerals, one would have to manually write out glyph codes
    depending on the particular font.  This is sorta crazy.  Would be nice if the
    Unicode people created Unicode ranges for ranging/lining numerals.\r\n\r\nCSS:
    \ I can't find anything in CSS3 spec regarding numerals.  It's too bad {text-transform:
    uppercase | lowercase} doesn't make numerals uppercase or lowercase.  Would be
    elegant if it did, but that would require coordination among the Unicode people,
    CSS people, and the browser people.\r\n\r\nMathematical characters: It might work
    to use MathML and &lt;math&gt; tags, at least to turn off ranging numerals.  Haven't
    tested it with the fonts I like to use.\r\n\r\nSolution: Simplest workaround seems
    to be to duplicate and rearrange and rename the fontfiles, swapping numerals as
    desired.  Is there a better way?  Am i missing something?  I would think changing
    numerals would be a very basic thing."

  body: "Yes the easiest solution would be to have two fonts, embedded or installed
    on the client machine. One font could just contain the osf's (mapped to the regular
    fig code points) the other the complete font with the standard figs. Then use
    CSS to switch font when you need to use the OSF's. I think this is acceptable
    (providing the EULA lets you do this) and standards-compliant.\r\n\r\nCheers,
