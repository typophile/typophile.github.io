    Stehend</a>, but either there''s a version with Swashes that I don''t know, or

    Caslon Italic]], also with custom swashes -- which I'm very jealous of, I want
    a wedding invitation like that! ( Well, with different tail ends probably, but

  body: "The third one: \r\nI just met the type designer of the third one this week
    in New York. His name is Joe Finocchiaro, http://www.joefino.com/ He just showed
    me this work. The basic was a photocopy of an quite similar script face and he
    had to adapt it for this logo. He is a great type designer."
