body: "I have seen but cannot remember the name of a beautiful and interesting font
  distinguished and perhaps most identifiable by its letter \"f\".\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe
  font is or resembles a geometric, having an even, rounded stroke with no real axis,
  and no slope. The ascender and descender on the lowercase f are vertically symmetrical
  save the crossbar being slightly higher than the middle, and the descender extends
  beyond the baseline significantly to achieve this symmetry.\r\n\r\nIf I were to
  guess based on my now somewhat vague recollection, it resembles a Helvetia or Futura,
  but is quite likely to be a postmodern.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for thoughts
  about what this might be."

    I do admire the description. It would not be out of place in a 19th century font
