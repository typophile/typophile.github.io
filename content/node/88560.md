body: 'I just bought Glyphs and have just been working with it for the most basic
  things (no contextual alternates, ligatures, masters, etc.) and have already run
  into a handful of different error messages and a file turn "corrupted" for whatever
  reason. And while the developer makes an admirable effort to address everyone''s
  problems, it''s just a confusing mess so far. Is anyone else having issues with
  Glyphs?  '

  body: 'The corrupted file issue I ran into is just a misused autosaving mechanism
    of OS X Lion: You open a UFO package, the app internally converts it to its native
    Glyphs document, you then edit the font, the autosave triggers off and saves the
    Glyphs document over the UFO. If you change the extension of such a corrupted
    file from .ufo to .glyphs it will read as nothing had really happened. Before
    this gets fixed, you can restore pre-Lion saving behavior in the app''s preferences
    or just duplicate the opened UFO as a Glyphs file before making any edits to a
    font.'

  body: "You might also disarm the control freak portion of Lion that forces the damn
    versions thing on you.  There is a preference in Glyphs that will do this for
    you.\r\nAre you using the current version of Glyphs?  Since Georg posted the update,
    I have had far fewer problems."

    Scary. So it has to do with Lion. Seems I\u2019ll stick to Snow Leopard as much
    as I can."

  body: "Time Machine is terribly unreliable. It just stops working with no explanation,
    requiring users to run through a series of possible fixes until it works again.
    This is exacerbated by Apple\u2019s continued inability to produce a reliable
    automatic external disk mounting daemon, something every other UNIX vendor worked
    out in the 1990s. In worst case scenarios Time Machine stops recognizing the backups
    that it created, and will not back up anything else to the same disk partition
    until the old files are gone. \r\n\r\nOn top of the reliability issues, Time Machine\u2019s
    interface is an atrocity; breaking away from anything resembling Mac UI standards
    for some addled Star Trek themed nonsense, reliant on cheesy 3D effects that have
    never been optimized to run quickly. \r\n\r\nEvery single person responsible for
    Time Machine should have been run out of Apple and the entire design and codebase
    should have been strangled in its crib. "

  body: "I'm lagging behind, using OS 10.5. Would you say that upgrading is a necessity?\r\n\r\nThe
    errors run the gamut from freezing when just moving a node, to not being able
    to export with the autohinting turned on. And the true mess begins when getting
    into masters. Ugh."

  body: "Upgrading probably won\u2019t help, but a fresh install of Mac OS might.
    I had a lot of problems om Glyphs on my four-year-old laptop until I got a new
    computer this year. On the new computer Glyphs is very stable and responsive.
    I suspect that this is because Glyphs relies heavily on Apple\u2019s Cocoa API
    and Cocoa gets mucked up over years of upgrades."

    good things. (I do get "Cocoa" error messages) Thanks for the tip.
