I think that everything works except the 'd', especially in the connected version.

I'd suggest changing the 'T' to lowercase, and reversing the swing on the crossbar (I've attached a sketch to show what I mean).

The top is much better than the bottom. Bottom looks stagnant and forced. Top is so playful and organic. FUN.

I'm guessing it's a soft-serve ice cream/custard place. The dollop on the i successfully says it must be something sweet.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I have to be honest, when I first read it I immediately thought the "d" was actually an "l" so it read "twistel" to me until you said it was "twisted." The reason being that the "d" looked like an "l" because of the loop or bowl or counter of the d being so low to the baseline. It looks more like and script "l" with a fancy loop. Also just because one sees the first 3 to 4 letters being "Twis..." does not mean that everyone is going to know it actually says "Twisted." And also remember that the last letter of a word is very important for reasons we all know. 

However, that said, I think both have something good going and I like the script version as well as the second one and I think they both have this "festive" feel to it. I think there is something you can try with the "s" perhaps tilting it to the angle of the "w & e"? just to see what it looks like while sitting diagonally in the middle of the ambigram. Just a suggestion, not saying it will work but could be interesting.

I like the loops and the connections between loops but I think you should check your weights. Making some of the connections of a heavier stroke or weight could help improve the ambigram. It does not entirely bother me but I think some of those connections could be heavier and stronger since they look and feel a little flimsy and weak.

Also, maybe you could try something different with the "i." Maybe you could make more of a sleek or thinner tear drop or dot of the "i." I feel they work on the second one but for the script version they could be thinner or slicker or something, but I feel they are too narrow or wide. 

Its looking good and fun and it looks good in black to.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Froy - I hear you about the second half of the word being less strong than the first. However, I would argue that having read 'Twis..' there are only so many directions the word can go, and your brain almost fills in the rest for you. To addition, the more the second half of the word is rendered legible, the less the first half is! And I would argue that the first half is more important. 

The rationale behind the line weights is thus: the first version had bits such as the 's' with varying weights within the actual letter. To improve legibility (especially at a distance - go on, try it, it's actually more legible when you stand back!), the joining or decorative lines would become lighter, and the lines making up the letter would be heavier. Those lines which are part of the letter in one instance and then a joining line in the other would be a middle thickness.

One last question:

If you were to see this above a shop, I think we can all agree you wouldnt be able to read it as instantaneously as other logos. 

Therefore, would this mean that you:

a. Lose interest and walk away?
b. Stand there until you've worked it out? (and maybe tell someone about it?)
c. Enter the shop to ask about it?
