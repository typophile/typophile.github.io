    Lights is distributed by Dafont, which usually does a passable job in checking
    for pirate versions. But it is the same, point for point, as A. Carr's Quicksilver,
    which may have been created earlier. I don't know which is the legitimate one.
    Also, there is the possibility there was another digitization used to make them.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"
