  body: "Your image is part of an alphabet, so that begs the question what is the
    source (often a help in these queries)?\r\n\r\nVery close is Patrick Broderick's
    <a href='http://www.rotodesign.com/fonts/' target='_blank'>Castaway</a> - a recreation,
    it would seem, of a typeface that appears in the predigital Solotype Catalog as
    'Confucius'. Your image, though, contains some differences in detail."

    to three years ago - and our moderator has not clued us into ..."

  body: In my folder labeled Bamboo fonts I have five - one named Bamboo2 is the one
    you are looking for - no credits when examined in FontLab info. The five all came
    from free sites, check Dafont and AbstractFonts.
