body: 'Hi i&#39;m working on a typography assignment for a university paper in New
  Zealand. The Assignment is &#34;Use the type from a non-alcoholic beverage and container
  to design your own perception. The inherent challenge being not to design an endorsement
  of the beverage, but to express  ametaphor or interpretation of it&#34;. <BR> <BR>The
  beverage i have choosen is a fruit juice beverage called Simply Squeezed. Since
  starting this project i have been  made aware of the turth, Simple Squeezed Juice
  has had preservatives, water, sugar added and the juices is made from concentrate.  <BR>
  <BR>I was trying to create the feeling that the type is under pressure, being crushed.
  The reasn i have made the type so hard to read is because the name &#34;Simply Squeezed&#34;
  is misleading when additives are used to make the juice. <BR> <BR>I have a question
  to ask: <BR>How would i make the type look under pressure compressed? <BR> <BR>Any
  feed back is much appreciated. <BR>thanks for your time <BR><!--attachment: Typography_assignment-34833.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/tiff*456.8*Typography+Assignment+development*Typography+assignment%2etif

    is gibberish. Jpeg or Gif will work for me.

  body: Nathan, if I read &#39;interpret&#39; rather than &#39;endorse&#39; correctly,
    this doesn&#39;t have to have any commercial feel to it

  body: Quite a beautiful form you have created.  It is more the look of pulp from
    squeezing rather than feeling squeezed. I think the difference is that you have
    created a texture by using so many letterforms.  You might try using far fewer
    words to make your point.  To show squeezing, you may need to have a visual comparison
    to anti-squeezing.  Maybe the word&#34;Simple&#34; is spaced normally and the
    word &#34;Squeezed&#34; uses progressively tightened letterspacing to the point
    of overlap.  The Yin makes the Yang apparent by juxtaposition.   <BR> <BR>ChrisL
