body: "Hi, I have a font that I'm using over and over again for a long running job
  I'm doing. It's a stylised, letterpress type font, and the baseline is uneven throughout.
  I'm having to adjust the baseline on each letter every time which is eating my time.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for somebody who can quickly edit the font so each letter sits on the same
  baseline (0), export it and send it back to me ready to use.\r\n\r\nI'm willing
  to pay if the price is very reasonable!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\n"
