  which involved the evolution of type/language.....\r\n\r\ni cant get into my photoshop
  at the mo... but ive started it off in latin/greek and ended up finishing off with
  chatroom lingo... just wanted to know if anyone else has, made anything similar
  which theyd care to show?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Do you mean info-aesthetically showing the progression, like with graphics
    and type aiding the information given? It would make a interesting short film/flash
    presentation.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, there have been a few books written about the
    evolution of type and visual language. I am reading one right now called 'Lettering'. "

  body: "I did this for a year during my MA. I mapped the British museum collection,
    cataloguing the pieces that had writing on them. I then divided them according
    to scripts and made a little book.\r\n\r\nIt would help me know what exactly you're
    talking about if you posted an example. But yeah, it sounds interesting!"

    some time to do the pdf's and stuff. It might not be a great idea, as I (shamefully)
    don't have a website to call my own. I'll come up with something.\r\n\r\nOh, and
    by \"little\" I meant BIG...I was trying to be sarcastic ;)"

  body: and i'd start off earlier than greek (which i believe came before latin),
    but with lasceaux, pictographs, and phoenician alphabets.

  body: "As far as I know (or believe) it went like this:\r\n- Proto-writing\r\n-
    Cuneiform\r\n- Hieroglyphs\r\n- Linear Scripts (A and B)\r\n- Greek\r\n- Cypriot\r\n-
    Etruscan\r\n- Latin\r\n- Western Alphabet\r\n\r\nWith some scripts coming and
    going in different directions:\r\n- Chinese\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Cyrillic\r\n- Mesoamerican
    scripts\r\n- Ogham\r\n- Runes\r\n\r\nI'd start in Proto-writing because that's
    the first time ideas (as opposed to objects) are expressed with pictures.\r\n\r\nI
    could go on and on and on and on about this, so I better stop now....\r\n"

    like this for individual letters and shorter periods of history, as does Jubert\u2019s
    <em>Typography and Graphic Design History</em>. Neither one is worth purchasing
    just for the diagrams\u2014especially the latter\u2014, but the former can be
    found on Google books as it has passed into the public domain. \r\n\r\nAnd Antonio,
    I would love to see your book as well :)"

    a PDF of it tonight. It will be of a five letter version of it; one I sent some
    people I admire in the design industry. I also have to post one to my tutor, who
    helped a lot during the MA.\r\n\r\nSpeak to you soon"

    get my lovely wife a birthday present, stopping to finally buy a comic book I've
    been looking for, getting home, editing my InDesign file and exporting it, I'm

    Anyone care to assist me on this? *keeps fingers crossed*\r\n\r\n*edit: I'll post
