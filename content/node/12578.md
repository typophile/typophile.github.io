    this:\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://journal.aiga.org/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nI
    thought the article had some interesting points but was overall kind of weak.
    It seemed to be focused on two interwoven threads that it persisted, to its detriment,
    in seeing as the same thing. On the one hand, there were typefaces that were experimental
    in <em>design</em>, such as the [[Emigre]] typefaces of the late 80s and early
    90s. On the other hand, there were the ones that used novel <em>technology</em>,
    like the Multiple Masters, fonts digitized using Ikarus, and the like. I was surprised
    that Wim Crouwel's Neu Alphabet, designed for use on CRTs, was omitted, but Adobe
    Garamond, a truly conservative typeface dressed up in new technological clothing,
    was included.\r\n\r\nMore to the point, is it really fair to say that the era
    of experimentation in digital type is over? It seems to me that the recent experiments
    with the new features in TrueType AAT and then OpenType presage a new era in experimentation.
    I think it's more that people's attention has moved on to other things (like rich
    media (again), and maybe consolidating what we've learned in the last 20 years).
    Still, there's lots of interesting historical nuggets in there."

  body: "I just got [[Doyald Young]]'s two books ([[Fonts and Logos]] and [[Logotypes
    and Letterforms]]), and he likes to use the word \"classy\" a whole bunch. Every
    time he does, I flash on Paul Fussell's <cite><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671792288\">BAD,
    or the Dumbing of America</a></cite> and its vision of faux-tasteful suburban
    country-club restaurants with rich Corinthian leather tasseled menus as far as
    the eye can see. In other words, every time Young describes something as \"classy\",
    my instant ingrained reaction is that it's kind of tacky and campy. This could
    also have to do with so much of Young's work being done in LA for the entertainment
    industry, and shouldn't be interpreted as a knock on Young's work itself, which
    is of course both magnificent and totally beyond my abilities.\r\n\r\nPresumably
    this isn't what you meant, but I guess I don't know what you did mean. Hooliganism?
    Who were the hooligans?"

    see somebody breaking a window and you ask him why and he says because he doesn't

  body: "Well, I'd agree that \u2013 and maybe this is a sign of the times, when a
    sense of post-iron-curtain-optimism, economic growth (even if it was a dotcom-bubble)
    and moderate,liberal political stances (even the wars fought, such as the US-intervention
    in Kosovo  at least *seemed* to be well-intended) has made room for less optimistic
    times, a more cynical approach to life. Most of the Western Hemisphere faces economic
    stagnation, we're in a pointless war against \xABterrorism\xBB, and everyday life
    feels more and more like something out of a Terry-Gilliam-movie. I see in my everyday
    work how clients become more conservative, how saving money has become a central
    theme and so on, how there is an \xABAngst\xBB, a fear that a bold design might
    actually drive customers away. It never ever does, in actuality, but my clients
    are terribly afraid of that and a large part of my job has become to work against
    that fear. The times that clients actually asked for braver designs, actually
    PUSHED me forwards...  seem to have gone, I'm afraid. I see how my students focus
    less on freedom, on experiment, on art and are more worried about getting a job
    in this whole design/advertising-business-shebang and on how to survive without
    compromising TOO much. There's a new generation of neo-designers growing up that
    actually WANTS to work for the big advertising companies, for the Ogilvies and
    BBDOs, something that wasn't as much of a trend in the 80s/90s, when everybody
    wanted to be the next Saville or Garrett or Carson or Oliver. Nowadays it's more
    about the money. \r\n\r\nSo the lack of experimentation in type is maybe (as always,
    with typography) a symptom. FUSE was a child of its time and so was Emigre. And,
    for that, so was Tschicholds Neue Typographie in the roraring 20s, to be followed
    by the fraktur reaction of the Third Reich. Design always moves in a sinus-curve-like
    fashion, it seems. Ornamentalism and Minimalism, Experimentation and more conservative
    times, retrospective and innovation...\r\n\r\nWe're in a phase where Helvetica
    seems to be a sexy font again, where even companies like Emigre produce legible
    and \xABsellable\xBB fonts, where revivals are de rigeur, and this maybe is kind
    of logical after an extended period of (sometimes garish) experimentation and
    even more so given the circumstances the western system of capitalism offers us
    right now. With 5.2 million unemployed people in germany, who wants to be experimental?
    (Now, personally, I'd think this would be an EXCELLENT TIME for more experimentation,
    but maybe that will come later...)\r\n \r\nMaybe it is also the fact that in the
    80s and 90s the tools were new and thus you tended to be more experimental with
    them. Much of what VanderLans and Licko did came from the fact that they HAD to
    build their own bitmap-fonts, because there was no other ready-made option, because
    they didn't have the choice of about a million fonts to be downloaded directly
    from the web. They wanted to do digital artwork, they HAD to be inventive, because
    it was the pre-Fontshop days. This was kinda like making music with the first
    MOOG synth. You had to work hard to make that little sucker sound good. I remember
    that Ultravox, whileproducing in Cologne, used guitar-amps to give their synths
    a distinctive sound. And think of Kraftwerk, making tehir own equipment, because...
    well, there was no Native Instruments Reactor to be downloaded back then. Now..
    now we have midi and absurdely good software samplers and synths for very very
    modest prices (god I wish, I had these toys when I was 18 and had the time to
    actually play with them :-D...) ... and yet, experimentation in music has gone
    down these days, there was more weird stuff happening in the early 80s, when the
    technology was fresh and young and NOT PERFECT. I remember, when I homerecorded
    in the 1980s, we had to play with both arms and with our feet and actually the
    teeth as well, to make it work. Effects were homemade and crude and awful... but
    damn, it was FUN figuring out how to make your cheap flanger make even weirder
    sounds, you now? \r\n\r\nI think, now that we have more perfected tools (and at
    the same time tools that aren't as easy to modify as the old Boss-Flangers, that
    aren't as simple and flexible), we tend to make well... more perfect and thus
    more boring work. When music-making-technology was crude and awful, the musicians
    came up with some of their greatest, most original work. Now that we have hyperglossysupertechnified
    HDD-recording music studios.... the mainstream-music has this warmed-up, been-there
    quality to it. And look.. most of what we have in the charts is the 80s warmed
    over. Music from an era when there was no MIDI or 24-but-sampling to speak of.
    Strange, eh? \r\n\r\nSame with the movies. Ray Harryhausen made very very crude
    animations, but damn... wasn't it more exciting than what we have today in all
    it's CGI perfection? wasn't Star Wars I and II better, because it was more imperfect,
    had more heart? And so on. We'll see hat part of the magic in the first Donner-Superman
    was that it WAS NOT CGI. The Bryan-Singer-Superman will be CGI and it will be
    dead boring (after Matrix III) to see a man fly. It will not be special anymore,
    it will be a mundane experience. The thrill is gone. \r\n\r\nDigital Typography,
    as it is, has cooled down. The Technology has advanced to the point that nowadays
    every student can work on a font on his laptop during courses, and maybe... just
    maybe... that makes it less sexy. Less cutting edge. Less the kinda stuff experimental
    souls would like to look into, do their thing with. Look at Sagmeister. When he
    did his sabbatical, what did he do typography with? Trees , toilet paper, sausages.
    NOT digital tools. The kick is in the primitive, the analogue direct feedback.
    Maybe these kind of experimental people interested in the digital realm now dab
    in video, interactivity, programming, RFID, in all kinds of intelli\u200Egent
    system and on how to us them for arts. There's always experimentation going on,
    but it has a certain \xABWanderlust\xBB, is mostly at the tipping point of emerging
    technologies, looking for the next wave to surf on. \r\nHD Schellnack"

  body: "Yeah! You damn kids in your suits get offa my lawn!\r\n\r\nI think you have
    a point, but maybe the point I think you have is different than the point you
    think you have. It seems to me that we do have much slicker tools for typeface
    design (although, sadly, there's nothing analogous to Reaktor or Rebirth or even
    Processing for typeface development). And, like in electronic music, the tools
    available to us are much more powerful and varied. There's very few arbitrary
    limits placed on our imagination as artists; if we can envision it, and we have
    the skills with our (complex, powerful, horribly documented) tools, we can realize
    anything we can imagine.\r\n\r\nI think that kind of freedom can be crippling,
    and at the same time it comes at the tail end of a long period of people exploring
    the new borderlands and mapping uncharted terrain. I'd disagree that music is
    less experimental now than it was 20 years ago; the Neptunes and Timbaland are
    still producing \"slicked-up pop music\" that would have made Autechre look tame
    10 years ago, and Autechre are making music that... well... actually, I don't
    pretend to understand what Autechre are doing anymore. They lost me with <cite>Confield</cite>.
    But there's plenty of stuff going on that's incredibly bizarre and forward-thinking,
    it's just that there's so much music being made by so many people that it's nearly
    impossible to keep track of what's going on, and what's called \"popular music\"
    is heard by such a relatively small group of people (as genres fragment into subgenres
    fragment into Audioscrobbler playlists) that it's unfair to judge the state of
    music by what makes it onto the charts.\r\n\r\nI think there's an analogy to the
    type biz in there somewhere. The technology has matured quite a bit (although
    I think we're all still wrapping our heads around OpenType, and will be doing
    so for quite some time -- and who knows what comes next after that), and for all
    the misty-eyed reminiscence of the good old days with Fontographer, FontLab is
    a much more powerful tool. Compared to when Emigre started, the tools we have
    now are mind-warpingly powerful -- too much so, in fact.\r\n\r\nAnyone subscribed
    to MyFonts' RSS feed for new font releases knows that new fonts are being released
    daily. Most of them suck, but most of them have always sucked, and it seems to
    me now that the means of producing high-quality fonts are as cheap, in historical
    terms, as they've ever been, the volume of quality typefaces being produced has
    exploded. Some of them are bound to be innovative.\r\n\r\nWhat does seem to me
    to be going on is one of those occasional periods of consolidation common in typographic
    history. Like classical music's obsession with \"period instruments\", contemporary
    typefounders are obsessed with making their revivals as faithful to the original
    as possible. OpenType has made it much easier to include things like swashes,
    small caps, and stylistic alternates (not to mention a wealth of figure types),
    so typographers can follow style manuals like the [[Elements of Typographic Style]]
    without tearing their hair out dealing with expert fonts. Enough crap has flooded
    the market over the last 10 years that selling halfassed script faces, or grunge
    faces, or remix faces is nowhere near as easy as it was when Chank was pretty
    much the only guy selling quirky fonts on the web. Typography is returning to
    its deeply conservative center of gravity, but what's conservative now was pretty
    radical not too long ago.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not like innovation has stopped. The
    Dutch crew and Veer and [[Jeremy Tankard]] and venerable old [[Hermann Zapf]]
    continue to surprise us all. It may be a more rarefied form of experimentation
    than once upon a time, but there's still a deep current of innovation flowing
    through typography. I think a number of people here (including me, I hope) may
    still have some tricks up our sleeves as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, this may be a sore
    spot for a lot of typophiles at the moment, but I didn't like the original <cite>Star
    Wars</cite> more because it was quantifiably better than the new movies. I liked
    it more because I was five years old when it came out, and Lucas got lucky in
    casting Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher before they got too famous to care about
    his boneheaded directing. I forget who said it (Robert Heinlein? Isaac Asimov?),
    but a famous science fiction author once said the Golden Age of science fiction
    was when the reader was 12 years old. It's easy to romanticize Ultravox now, but
    don't forget that even though they were once new and radical, eventually they
    started churning out crap worse than even most of Britney's recent output."

  body: "There are still experimental typefaces, but the experiments are more sophisticated
    than 15 years ago. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is not much of a retail market for experimental
    fonts.\r\nArt directors and graphic designers are more interested in treatments
    (faux, dimensional, transparency) than letterforms per se, and retro (kitsch,
    ironic, whatever) is much in demand.\r\n\r\nIf you look at retail font sales info
    from Veer, Myfonts, Fonts.com, etc., the big online retailers, you will see that
    the demand is for classic mid-20th century sans serif designs, and for retro scripts.\r\n\r\nA
    good market for foundries -- publications. Custom work, and multi-user licensing
    makes this attractive, and this ultra-conservative market is enticing foundries
    away from experimental work.\r\n\r\nSome enlightened corporate commissions produce
    experimental work, for instance the Foundry's face for NatWest bank, and Jason
