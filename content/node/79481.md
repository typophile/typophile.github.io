body: "Hi, I've been asked to quote on creating a fully functioning font from a series
  of characters in TIF format.\r\nThing is, I've never actually done this before!\r\n\r\n:/\r\n\r\nI'm
  in luck as there are only 40 or so characters in the set, and they are a loosely
  drawn display font. Hence this is not a complex project requiring the full functionality
  of professional high-end software.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the process is essentially
  to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 auto-trace the characters (they are in a loose style already -
  mostly straight edges, as if cut out by paper)\r\n\u2022 tidy up a little in Illustrator\r\n\u2022
  then import each character into a font program\r\n\u2022 apply some auto-kerning/optical
  kerning value\r\n\u2022 print out sample specimens, spot awkward kerning combinations
  and adjust as necessary\r\n\u2022 output as PostScript + True Type\r\n\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nCan
  you please recommend a simple program that will enable me to do this, without the
  full-blown feature set or complexity of a super high-end font program? Many, many
  thanks in advance!"

    you might give [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/|TypeTool]] a try!\r\n\r\nYour
    workflow sounds pretty reasonable, [[http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/working-with-illustrator-and-fontlab-studio-updated-for-illustrator-cs5-t7596.0.html|here]]
