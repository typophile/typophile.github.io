body: "I'm interested in creating a typeface for the [[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/vine.htm|Vine
  alphabet]], if only because it creates such an appealing look.  (Also, since I'm
  not enlightened in traditional type, I suppose critiques on experiments will be
  less deriding. ;)  However, it's a very peculiar script, and I'm not familiar with
  all of the capabilities of OpenType, so I'd like to know if the following things,
  among others, are possible, and in what circumstances:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Vertical
  text in left-to-right columns</li>\r\n<li>Vowels as diacritics (or maybe just fancy
  kerning)</li>\r\n<li>Arbitrary ligatures, e.g. 'zz', 'sc', 'pph'</li>\r\n<li>Marking
  the start of a line/sentence (or maybe just captials)</li>\r\n<li>Forcing line break
  at end of sentence</li>\r\n<li>Continuing hypenation on a new line</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIf
  too many of these capabilities end up to be dependent on the typesetting tool rather
  than OpenType, I may just turn this into an SVG/EMCA script.  Thanks for any tips
  in advance.\r\n\r\nEDIT: attached the graphical description of the alphabet.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vine_3871.gif]"

  body: "1) nothing to do with OpenType per se, although OpenType certainly has functionality
    helpful in supporting vertical text.\r\n\r\n2) If you want Latin vowels to turn
    into diacritics, that would take some thought. Probably.\r\n\r\n3) Yes, and it's
    quite easy.\r\n\r\n4) Not exactly. You could simulate these half-decently with
    contextual functionality, though.\r\n\r\n5) That would definitely be a function
    of the typesetting tool.\r\n\r\n6) Not quite sure what that means, but probably
    not, if I'm guessing right.\r\n\r\nSo, your second and fourth items would be tricky.\r\n"

  body: "Hmm, right down the middle, nice.  I suppose I could try both.\r\n\r\nBy
    continuing the hyphen, I mean having a contextual marker at the start of the continued
    line.  I've attached the Vine alphabet reference image to the root post to show
    what I mean.  I can guess that it could be simulated as well, though, due to the
    nature of the script (no word breaks)."

  body: "One thing to keep in mind is that classical Mongolian descends from the Arabic
    abjad, but written from top to bottom instead of left to right. You\u2019re going
    to have to deal with many things that cause problems in Arabic design, so if you
    find no explanations for classical Mongolian (not surprising, there\u2019s not
    much computer support yet), look to what\u2019s been done for Arabic.\r\n\r\nYour
    requirement for split hyphenation, where a hyphen appears on both the end of one
    line and the beginning of another, will be a typesetting problem and not easily
    solvable through OpenType. I think the old German orthography problem of duplicating
    a letter on the following line (e.g. \xBBSchiff-/fahrt\xAB for \xBBSchiffahrt\xAB)
    is basically similar. Marking the start of a line or sentence is also better done
    in typesetting, since it will often need to be adjusted by hand. Fighting with
    a font\u2019s automatic behavior is a losing battle.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let any
    of this dissuade you from trying to make the font work rather than going with
    SVG or something. You can do most of what you want in OpenType, and having done
    so you\u2019ll end up with many more intellectual rewards. The result will also
    have a much broader potential audience."
