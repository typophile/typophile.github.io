  Vinne or Devinne. They all have serifs but that is where any similarity ends. So,
  back to the question, what is De Vinne relative to fonts - history, definition,
  etc.?  If someone would care to be enlightening, that would be awesome. \r\n\r\nJames"

    ad, Saturday Evening Post, 1906.\r\nFonts: De Vinne by G. Schroeder, 1893; Numbered
    Oldstyle. Anon.\r\nTypical of the Progressive Era, during which the rate of infant
    mortality was halved, this ad promotes a gender neutral exercise machine for children.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere
    is part of a text I\u2019ve been working on, which describes the \uFB01rst De
    Vinne typeface (shown above):\r\n\r\nElzevir, originally designed in the late
    18th century, was revived in France in the 1880s and enjoyed a return to popularity
    in the USA, inspiring Gustav Schroeder's \u201CDe Vinne\u201D of 1893 (Elzevir
    Bold, really), which became the most popular typeface of the 1890s. It was named
    after Theodore De Vinne, the leading figure in American typography. He was a printer
    in the wide sense of the term as it was then employed, a publisher of books and
    magazines, instigator of coated paper, co-founder of the Grolier Club for bibliophiles,
    and an authority on typography who wrote extensively on the subject. Of the eponymous
    face, De Vinne said, \u201CThis face is the outcome of correspondence (1888-90)
    between the senior of the De Vinne Press [meaning himself] and Mr. J. A. St. John
    of the Central Type Foundry of St. Louis, concerning the need of plainer types
    of display, to replace the profusely ornamented types in fashion, of which the
    printers of that time had a surfeit. The DeVinne Press suggested a return to the
    simplicity of the true old-style character, but with the added features of thicker
    lines and adjusted proportion in shapes of letters. Mr. St. John approved, but
    insisted on grotesques to some capital letters in the belief that they would meet
    a general desire for more quaintness. Mr. Werner of the Central Type Foundry was
    instructed to draw and cut the proposed face in all sizes from 6- to 72-point,
    which task he executed with great ability. The name given to this face by Mr.
    St. John is purely complimentary, for no member of the De Vinne Press has any
    claim on the style as inventor or designer. Its merits are largely due to Mr.
    Werner; its few faults of uncouth capitals show a desire to please eccentric tastes
    and to conform to old usage. The new face found welcome here and abroad; no advertising
    face of recent production had a greater sale.\u201D\r\nThe De Vinne typeface was
    a successful compromise between two established forces competing for the soul
    of the popular magazine. \r\nThe foundry man claimed it for commercial interest,
    as a business venture captivating the consumer with visual spectacle, in the manner
    of brash job-printed flyers and bills larded with exotically dimensionalized fonts,
    or lithographed posters with even more ornately flourished lettering. St. John
    recognized the need for something new and eye-catching, and Schroeder's (not Werner,
    as De Vinne had mistakenly believed) adaptation provided that, with the quiet
    personality which the features of Elzevier possessed as a light text type becoming
    quite loud in the guise of a bold display face, the upper case features going
    so far as to impress DeVinne as \"grotesques\". It was a marriage of Parisian
    cachet with Yankee brashness. Such commercial interest found its foothold in the
    advertising of mass magazines, which during the 1890s became an experimental laboratory
    for marketing communication.\r\nDe Vinne claimed the magazine for typography and
    idealism, the editorial well his stronghold, calling for fonts of dignity and
    simplicity used in the understated manner of quality book and traditional magazine
    printing; but while he railed against the usual late Victorian suspect of profuse
    ornament, he too needed something new, for there were plenty of beautiful, simple,
    functional Victorian faces he could have turned to, but they had been around awhile,
    and their virtues had palled.\r\nAlthough Mr De Vinne was not entirely satisfied,
    he couldn't argue with the instant and immediate success of his eponymous face.
    A year later (1894) he began working more closely with a typefounder, Linn Boyd
    Benton, on a commission for the Century magazine, of which he was publisher. The
    strict demeanour of the resulting Century Roman was more to his taste, and the
    heft of its hairlines more to his ease (he was 66 at the time); the face would
    not become popular, although its descendants would. The Century family branched
    out with Century Expanded (1900), Century Oldstyle (1906), and Century Schoolbook
    (1918). \r\nIn Devinne and Century, there is a gradual movement away from the
    refined detail of the Scotch Modern, which had been the favored style of everyday
    text type in the US for 60 years, and the more recent but similar in effect Old
    Style, towards a heavier impression, matching the tenor of the times which found
    its most forceful expression in William Morris. Like De Vinne, Morris was in his
    sixties in the nineties, so their beef with fine type may well have been age-related. "

  body: "Nice commentary, Nick. Looking forward to your book! \r\n\r\nDeVinne was
    a great and unique character in the history of printing and type, being both the
    leading American printer and scholar of printing and type history in his day.
    \ His [[http://archive.org/details/historicprinting00devirich|Historic Printing
    Types]] is a great book and thankfully it's on line\u2014the link goes to it.
    He has an superb eye, and his critiques are extremely insightful and not dated
    at all, which is pretty astonishing. \r\n\r\nI consulted it in doing my article
    about the 19th century revival of Old Style types, and Caslon in particular, for
    July 2011 edition of <em>Printing History</em>. There is also a first rate series
    of historical articles by Ovink, called '19th Century Reactions against the Didone
    Type Model' which includes the history of the French old styles. I consulted these
    also, thanks to the tip by William Peterson, then editor of Printing History.
    Nick, you might want to consult those, if you don't know them already. \r\n\r\nI
    think the 'grotesque' display 'DeVinne' is not worthy of his name, though he may
    not have had a problem with it. His legacy in type design is really the Century
    series, which bears the stamp of his ideas, even though the Bentons drew it. There
    is also a Linotype DeVinne in metal, which is a Scotch style, without the thickened
    thin strokes of Century. It was very widely used, especially in scientific texts,
    I believe, though I may have it wrong; Bitstream did a revival of it, as Nick
    notes. DeVinne himself constantly used a lot of Scotch style types as a printer,
    as Nick's illustration shows, even though his Century was intended to improve
    on the style. "
