  body: No, not quite right on.  It's VF Sans, a private typeface designed for Vanity
    Fair magazine by Terminal Design, Brooklyn.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VF

  body: ok well then do either of you know where i can get one of these for free,
    neutraface is a house industry font which probs cost more than i have and the
    vf sans was somehow used by that designer for the identity, let me know, thanks!

  body: "Ask the designers at House Industries or James Montalbano of Terminal Design.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    What I'm saying is that asking for fonts that obviously aren't free is wrong.
    Please don't do it here (or anywhere else, for that matter). Some of these designers
    are active participants of these forums. \r\n\r\nNow maybe we could suggest free
    or system fonts to replace the paid ones. You could try Futura or TW Century.
    They're not free, but they might already be installed on your machine. I'll try
    to think of some others. "
