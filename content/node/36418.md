  rather dimly lit. each panel will only have a few sentences at most and so far i''m
  looking at sans serif typefaces that will be at least 36 pt - any suggestions on
  something that could possibly work reversed out or is it ridiculous to even consider
  light text on a dark background under not awesome lighting? '

    systems. FFInfo, Frutiger, Clearview, and plenty of other fonts could work just
    fine. You might also think about printing on some kind of reflective paper, or
    maybe even getting a sign shop to help you out with these if you have the budget."

    used in reverse. [[http://clearviewhwy.com/TypefaceDisplay/index.php|see here]]\r\n\r\nYou
    also might need to add a thin hairline around the letters, to compensate for the
    visual effect of the stem weights creeping in. \r\n\r\nOf course the most important
    thing is to make a test sample(s) and try it in the actual space, or as close
    an approximation as you can find.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "In dim lighting it may be prudent to use dark letters on light backgrounds.
    What is confusingly referred to as Negative Contrast. The light background of
    the panel, especially if they are lighter than the wall color, may help readability.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    to size, I believe ADA guidelines specify 1 inch of cap height for every 50 ft
    of viewing distance.(I know this is what FHWA has built their spec on). Also remember
    not to go too bold. A maximum stem weight of 1:5 stroke width to height ratio
    is the boldest you should go. (also the boldest allowed in the ADA spec)\r\n\r\nThat
    1 inch cap height spec refers to all caps settings. IF you use mixed case you
    should go larger.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "[[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm|ADA site here]]\r\nHowever as
    I understand the ADA law, the requirements apply to signs identifying permanent
    spaces in buildings. I'm guessing that the signs in question would be supplying
    information about an exhibit, for instance identifying an artwork's title and
    artist. In a circumstance like that, the informational sign is not required to
    adhere to the ADA standard, although the sign identifying the name of the exhibit
    room (as well as Men's room, etc), would be required to comply.\r\n\r\nAs James
    mentions, even if the law doesn't require these signs to comply, the spec is still
    a useful guideline for any signs to ensure your signs can be read by a broad section
    of the population.\r\n\r\nJason C"
