  1' x 5'. I'm toying with the idea of putting an inset quote into the face of it
  using laser-cut core 10.\r\n\r\nI really like James' Recovery revival (and this
  would be a fun excuse to buy it):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=NzQ5\r\n\r\nSo
  I made a (really) quick mock-up. I didn't do any letterspacing and just used the
  online typesetter for now. \r\n\r\nThe house was built in 1927, so I think it's
  roughly the same era as the typeface references. It's also a nice fat face so would
  be easier to inset into the concrete. It is latin, so perhaps that's a bit of conflict
  with the era of the language.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/recovery_5980.jpg]"

    depth extremely slight - almost invisible. Anything more and you will tire of
    it soon enough, and start hating it, and hence the entire house.\r\n\r\nThe font
    choice is cool, I would just worry about that \"G\", especially in a foreign language.
    I might try out Penumbra too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I would make the font choice based on the architecture of the entire room as opposed
    to the material of the hearth. \r\n\r\nAnd FWIW, a concrete fireplace is *so*
    sweet. "

  body: "I was assuming you will engrave the text into the concrete, but now I think
    I understand that the letters will be brass or something, and laid in flat. That
    sound good too, but in that case I would use a silvery but low-sheen metal. My
    point is it should not grab the eye, even though it's cool - it should be a subtle
    element in your whole.\r\n\r\nBTW, concerning your desire for historical accuracy:
    all things being equal that's certainly a good thing, but fair-faced concrete*
    certainly isn't period to the 1920s, so your choice of font can be much more free,
    to match the overall atmosphere.\r\n\r\n* My dad, an engineer, calls it that -
    is that what you guys call it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "1927... what kind of home? craftsman? mission? foursquare? I'd think that
    would drive your decision. This feels deco to me, not arts & crafts ala ITC Rene
    Mackintosh P22 Dard Hunter etc. But then, a concrete fireplace in an old house
    says you may not want a period look as Hrant noted. Post us some photos or more
    info. Cool project. I've got a mantle to do at my house (1938) \"before christmas.\"\r\n\r\nBTW
    Hrant, board formed concrete indoors is the rage.. that's my guess."

  body: "hrant...ah...yes it'd be flush with the surface. I was thinking stainless
    originally, but was afraid of not having any contrast against the gray of the
    concrete.\r\n\r\nRandy...as for as true authenticity, that's already been thrown
    out the door a while ago. It's a 1927 quasi tudor/quasi arts and crafts. It has
    elements of both but doesn't scream either. First floor formal rooms are original.
    Bath is modern. Kitchen is 'contemporary (remodelled by previous owners) and this
    mantle is going in our finished basement against an existing massive brick fireplace.
    The basement is maybe 'loft styled' with stained concrete floors. So, yea, it's
    a mix, so not too worried about the neighborhood architectural board knocking
    at the door. ;0)\r\n\r\nI'd agree with the deco vibe, but Mackintosh, as much
    as I love that, would be too over the top in this house, IMHO. At least in the
    basement it would be.\r\n\r\nJames...good point! I look forward to working with
    that typeface! \r\n\r\nGranted all this is predicated on being able to actually
    afford laser cut letters, so we'll see if I can get over that first hurdle. "

  body: "Interesting. Ah.. I see you're in twin cities, land of excellent old houses
    -- Curious to see what a quasi-tudor-ac looks like. I say go with your original
    thought. It has a streamlined golden age of industry feel that seems like it would
    fit the mood you're creating in the basement.\r\n\r\nOnly other thought I had
    is to go completely ornate in a move toward contrast and also to inject some humor
    into the quote: \"it is pleasant to do nothing.\" By ornate, I mean Marian Bantjes-esque

    love Marian's work and I get what you're saying (and think it's a good idea).
    Alas, that would be more of a fabrication issue in this case. \r\n\r\nI found
    out that one can water-cut copper, so I think I'm aiming for copper now over the
    core10. Waiting patiently for the price estimates..."

    using an em dash and just having it all on one line. Did I mention I love this

  body: "Tiffany...were you thinking smaller or bigger in proportion to the hearth?\r\n\r\nI
    was originally thinking of going smaller, and actually justifying it lower-right.
    More of a 'oh! There's a quote there' surprise. \r\n\r\nThat said, if I do go
    with copper, the center would maybe offer some interesting reflections from the
    fire.\r\n\r\n"
