  type:\r\n\r\nPresident's choice packaging (it is replacing the over-used Trajan
  they previously had on their labels): http://www.presidentschoice.ca/\r\n\r\nSci-fi
  channel website: http://www.scifi.com/onair/index.php?id=0\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  what fonts are similar to this and have a similar feel.  So far I've discovered:\r\n\r\n-Futura\r\n-Century
  Gothic\r\n\r\nwhat else is like those?\r\n"

  body: "It would be great to have an updated opentype version of Futura, with all
    the alts and osf that Renner originally designed. \r\nIn saying that Neutraface-2
    is ridiculously useable (more for text than Futura I would say) and although a
    different beast, it is in similar vein (ish)"
