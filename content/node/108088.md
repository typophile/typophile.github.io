  we are finally getting a server and some proper font management for the entire studio!
  Very exciting. I just wanted to ask about your favorite options, programs, and if
  you had any tips on making the transition.\r\n\r\n<em>Fonts stored on the server
  vs. fonts stored locally...</em> Is it a good idea to have all the designers using
  fonts off of a server? Does this slow down font performance at all?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n"

    the server be read-only to all clients so they can't add or delete font files
    on the server; it is the server Admin's job to keep it organized properly and
    maintain good DRM.\r\n\r\nSlowdown? Nothing noticeable."

    well. As George said you need someone to manage it properly. \r\n\r\nBut if you
    have any office laptops that are used away from the network they'll need to have
    the fonts installed."

  body: UTS Universal Type Server is probably a good place to look for a start. It's
    by Extensis. They used to have Font Reserve and that was not so great with lots
    of issues, but UTS seems pretty reliable. I think they have plug-ins specific
    to Adobe Illustrator, but I don't remember the details on that.

  body: "Universal Type Server has app-specific plug-ins for InDesign, Photoshop,
    Illustrator and QuarkXPress.\r\n\r\nExtensis had two previous server-based font
    management apps (its own Suitcase Server and the acquired Font Reserve Server),
    and then started over again with a new codebase for UTS to rectify a variety of
    architectural errors. That was quite some years back; UTS is now on version 4.\r\n\r\nThe
    Universal Type Client is based on the same code as Suitcase Fusion."

  body: Does Universal Type Server allow users to see what fonts look like without
    downloading the entire server library to their local machine? Part of the reason
    we're looking for a server solution is to allow users to more easily preview and
    utilize the fonts we already own. But we're currently running a trial of FontExplorer
    Server and it requires users to either download each font off the server individually
    or download the entire collection off the server before they can see what any
    of the fonts actually look like.

  body: "My recollection is, UTS can preview select fonts without downloading all
    of them, yes.\r\n\r\nBetter, the speed for synchronizing fonts with the server
    has just gone up immensely in the new release. \u201CUp to 27x faster\u201D it
    says."
