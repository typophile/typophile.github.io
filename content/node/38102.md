  AUCTION?\r\n[[http://www.artandauction.com]]\r\nIt's similar to a number of undigitised
  Grotesks, such as Berthold Standard or Stephenson Blake's Adonis, but is different.
  \r\nI think it's available as a digitised font (as opposed to a custom design) because
  it looks like the font is used quite extensively for cover lines.\r\nIf you can
  identify it for me I'd be happy to send you the finished catalogue (on rare 20th
  century photography books) that I'm planning to use it for. \r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    too to ITC Blair.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's used throughout the mag doesn't mean
    it isn't custom."

  body: "Thanks Patty\r\n\r\nSimilar indeed, but not the same. The circular shapes
    aren't so extended. The 'C' and 'O' are much nearer round here, which is why I
    like this font. The way the 'C' is cut is more in keeping with the more 'Germanic'
    Grotesks, say Neuzeit or Nobel, but they're a different style font altogether.
    It seems to be some kind of hybrid of the two styles. \r\n\r\nGotham is getting
    close. Might do the trick. I'd really like to know what this one is though! Dammit\r\n"

  body: "you're right, it is different, thanks stephen. Guess it could well be a custom
    then. \r\nIt seems Sackers is basically an engravers font without the line-ended
    serifs? it still has that feel about it.\r\n\r\nGotham is a great font. Tobias
    has done a great job. I'm tempted to straighten his legs a bit though\r\n\r\n"
