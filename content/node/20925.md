    there doesn't seem to be an oblique... may have been done manually - is this just
    on a jacket or is it throughout the book?"

  body: On Fontbureau's web site it says "additional styles available" which might
    mean the italic/oblique, but why wouldn't they show that. Beats me. It would be
    a lot of work to manually oblique it throughout an entire book.

  body: Not many slabs as square as Dispatch, but you could consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.120977.0.0">PMN
    Caecilia</a> an alternative.

  body: "<em>i like pmn caecilia, but it takes up quite a bit of space when setting
    body copy</em>\r\n\r\nRemember that economy isn't just about width. It also involves
    less-obvious aspects like counters, aperture, and x-height. Caecilia can be set
    smaller than other faces. It's still quite readable at 7-9 pt.\r\n\r\n<em>how
    does thesis serif compare to ceacilia? it looks pretty similar to me.</em>\r\n\r\nBoth
    are excellent. The extra variations in TheSerif are helpful, but I prefer Caecilia's
    larger counters and more upright italic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caecilia-theserif_3869.gif]"

    Dispatch.\r\n\r\nAnd another Dutch designer!"

  body: I know its an old standby, but i feel like Dispatch is a updated/modern version
    of Berthold City - and that has obliques. not necessarily the prettiest thing
    in the world, but it works for the squared of slab serifs.

  body: I hope you don't mind I disagree on the Berthold City similarity, Justin.
    But I <em>do</em> agree that obliques are not necessarily the prettiest thing
    in the world, yet sometimes they work indeed, even incredibly well in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11681.0.13">specific
    cases</a>.
