  he said that we should <strong>never</strong> use justified text because it causes
  too many rivers. Period. Oh, and nobody did justifed type until this century.  \r\n\r\nWhen
  I countered that Gutenberg used justifed text, he kinda brushed me off saying, \"yeah,

    typographer and he's to ignorant to learn the software. I can't believe that.
    That is rediculous.\r\n\r\nHe's never heard of H & J's? He's never seen a gorgeous
    book from Hartley and Marks? Or Hyphen? Or David R. Godine? Does he use Bringhursts
    Elements? Has he ever seen a book? Has he ever seen a piece of classical literature?\r\n\r\nI
    feel brilliant compared to this guy. Well, your homework should be easy right.
    Just wipe with a couple pieces of paper, bind them together and put them on his
    desk, he'll probably praise you as a genius.\r\n\r\nThis just makes me angry.
    I've had a few teachers that talk like they know about things they actually dont,
    but this guy takes the cake.\r\n\r\nIf you'd be so kind to your classmates and
    recommend to them, James Felici's [[Complete Manual of Typography]] and regard
    anything he says with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n*When you're done with him for good,
    file a formal complaint with the school, and include TP threads to back you up.

    so funny, because that is EXACTLY what I did for one of his classes! He teaches
    the web design class at my school, but I had a feeling he was teaching web design
    circa 1998. I asked him if you could design an entire web page NOT using tables,
    and he responded, \"Why would you want to do that?\"\r\n\r\nSo I went and found
    the greatest book on web design I've ever seen, the Head First Guide to XHTML,
    sat down at Barnes and Nobles for about 8 hours reading almost the whole book,
    then proceded to prove him wrong by creating a thoroughly modern webpage sans
    tables.\r\n\r\n8 hours at Barnes and Nobles Vs. A Quarter of Web Design? Should

    and to just buy Classroom in a Book instead. \r\n\r\nOn a related note, last semester
    I had a web design class by a first-rate designer/web developer/UI developer.
    Unfortunately the curriculum he had to teach us had not been updated since HTML
    4.0, so most lectures went something like this:\r\n\r\n\u201COk, open up Dreamweaver
    and create an X by X table. Now stick the images into it. Now go through the image
    map tutorial. Once you've finished this, remember to never, ever design a web
    site like this. God I hate this curriculum. Whoever put this class together was
    an idiot.\u201D\r\n\r\n"

    a table etc. This brings totally confusing markup. If a beginner tries to keep
    the layout neat... there are not much problems with css. Especially if a teacher
    with profund knowledge in semantic markup and css is on his side.\r\n\r\nPS. \r\nBeginners

    you what to do, it tells you WHY you need to do it. Purely semantic mark-up using
    XHTML Strict and CSS. Oh, and it teaches you to use TextEdit for all of your coding.\r\n\r\nIt
    makes more sense for me as a designer, honestly. I can rough out the entire page
    by hand in picas like any other design, then the coding is purely spec'ing everything
    out in ems. It's like what I suppose designers had to do way back in the day when
    they didn't do their own typesetting.\r\n\r\nIt allows me to focus on what I want

    This is why I expect Flash to eventually surpass XHTML/CSS: Macromedia was already
    doing a lot of great stuff with stylesheets, dynamic content, and database connectivity.
