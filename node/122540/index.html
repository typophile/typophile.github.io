  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone,

Pardon my amateurism. 
I am looking for sources (books, articles, researchers,..) on the geometric analysis of letter shapes. All typography books and sites I have seen are concerned on type design aesthetically and historically, but do not address its geometric, non-artistic and non-aesthetic foundations:
 - decomposition of letters in sub-shapes, structure of sub-shapes and comparison of letters' super-structures
 - mathematical definitions of distance between shapes and letters, geometric definition of legibility
 - analysis of 1D (no width) versus 2D (with width), geometric analysis of fonts
 - geometric analysis and comparisons (and critiques) of fonts, of alphabets
 - conceptualisation of new letters
 - ....etc.

Does it even exist? Who in the world and history of typography has written about these fundamental topics?

Thank you,
Pierre

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Riccard0,

Thank you for your answers. I agree there always has been artistic choice in the definition of letters since the very beginnings, but I believe you understood what I was referring to: a viewpoint on letter design that puts this aspect away for a moment and concentrate on the geometry.
The works you mentioned are fascinating, and the majesty of roman capitals hasn't lost its grandeur. I wonder if something like this was made in modern times for lower cases, do you know?

After all, modern typesetting tools are extremely mathematical, as they define every typeface via vectorial settings of coordinates, bezier curves,..etc. - most of it being used only graphically, not mathematically.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Romain du Roi, beautiful work designed by 4 scientists under the order of the king Louis XIV, however is not yet what I am after. It defines a typeface, but I am after the common underlying structure that can define that an "h" is an "h" and not a "k", in any typeface. I am after the definition of the nature of "x" and "o". Just like in music the convention of note pitches evolved to what it is today, I am wondering if there has been modern (by which I probably mean 20th/21st century) attempts to define our unspoken conventions for Type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting question. Most  times a computer displays a letter or prints it it is implementing a scheme to reduce the geometry of the bezier curves defining the outline to pixel positions - it is all very mathematical. Thankfully the designer only tweaks the vector handles and need not bother with the maths.

If what you are seeking is the simplest mathematical way to represent letters, analytic geometry can do that. For example  a very thin san-serif I 10 units high is represented by  x=0 , With y more than zero and less than 10. I tried typing more than with its symbol the tilted v, but the html thinks it is the end of the paragraph and deletes the rest! Representing a generic O  is in the form x^2+(y-5)^2=26 (which adds an optical adjustment of half a unit!) where ^ represents "to the power". An x needs two lines one of which is x=y  between zero and 10 for both x and y, and so on. Graphic plotters would use some such representations in the software programs. Hope I got all this right!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Vladimir,

I agree the maths of computer displays must be very complex, taking colours, zones of pixels and pixels themselves all into account to refine, simplify or break the original bezier curves and shape contours. Thankfully I am not interested in this, but in the definition of the letter "templates", the mental geometric constructs that our brain create early on in our lives that make us recognise each letter.

Your second paragraph is a part of the answer: yes the simple template for an "I" is a vertical line, the template for an "O" or "o" is a vertical ellipse, and "x" and "X" are made of intersecting lines.
Those are the simplest letters, the simplest structures and if we calculate an average of those letters in every typeface, we can expect the deviation to be small. Some letters may have higher deviations, for instance the "a", "g", "z".. Those averages and deviations can be calculated, and from this work a convention can emerge.
I am looking for people and resources who worked on this.</div>

You seek, or will become a Linnaeus of typography! He is the botanist who created a taxonomy of biology classifying species according to their attributes. One way to classify letters and glyphs is topological - how many counters do they have? I,r,s etc= zero.
R,p,q etc= one. B,g= two.  Or perhaps you are seeking to define  a generic shape, the Platonic ideal for every letter?  In my AlQuds font I did something like that for Arabic when I decided on the simplest most recognizable shape of a letter, given the many fancy calligraphic forms it could take. I did that instinctively and not in the systematic analytical  way you may want for Latin.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Vladimir, 
Thank you for the comparison. Getting to a classification is not my objective, however could be an outcome of the ability to compare and measure in an objective way. From this ability, the ability to create an average, which might or not might be identical to a "platonic" ideal - this would be an interesting discussion: it might be the case that an average "g" isn't as pretty, simple, or recognisable as it could be, hence the ability to optimise templates. But one cannot form an ideal without being able to assess the present. Right now, every typographer has his/her own representation and judgements of types, and his/her own ideals, without an objective way to contrast and compare, as it typography was pure design/art, and not also a social communication tool which implies requiring a convention.
I cannot judge your AlQuds font as I am entirely ignorant of this, but the way you described makes me believe you understand my aim. 

Hi Nick:
Thank you very much. I have ordered the book, and am reading about Panose and will probably contact its creator, Ben Bauermeister, to find out the recent evolutions. His work is a part of the solution, as it introduced measures of several font characteristics. I'd be curious to see what/if it has been used to measure individual letters, to see if his work has been ported in Fontlab modules...etc. I'll ask him.

		<div class="commentbody">While I’m happy to help and discuss this topic, I disagree that geometric analysis addresses what is  fundamental to typography. 

People have been trying to reduce typography to scientiﬁc analysis and management since Dürer, but it seems to me that most geometry in glyph shapes stems from the peculiarities of different technologies—both those used to design, punch or draw the type, and those used to render typography. 

Where the style is a script, the technology is a brush and paper, and the rendering is (hand-spaced) phototypositor, there is no geometry, and yet is this not type? Therefore, geometry is not fundamental.

In the ﬁrst 25 years of digital type, prior to high-res Retina screens, the discipline of hinting, concerning alignment zones and stem widths, has encouraged neatness and regularity in type design—eminently measurable—but at the same time there has been a parallel track of grunge, deconstruction, distress and skeuomorphic imitation of rough, hand-rendered lettering of analog media. And this too is type! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes Riccard0 thats the idea.  Playing with the concept lePierre suggested is fun but I rather agree with Nick. Fonts evolve and whatever is currently most used/liked is the acceptable shape of the letter. Cultural influences play a large part.. for example when Arabic numerals  were introduced to Europe they were very close to the Arabic script in style. Since then they have evolved to match Latin  letters serifs and all. Some misguided literary people in Beirut in the 1950s 'discovered' these Westernized  numerals and adopted them as the original Arabic numerals! Now they are the norm sticking out like sore thumbs between the Arabic type, while the traditional Arabic numerals (Indic) languish for non-use. Similar outrages are now plaguing Arabic fonts whereby one of the Google web fonts all but unreadable is being adopted for its novelty. Glyphs  change.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Vladimir: your remark on the evolution of numerals is fascinating, I would love to read about it.

@riccard0: the averia is interesting, eerie and familiar. Thank you.

@eliason: there is plenty of luck to have here already! But I concur that the recognition of letterforms impose to ability to compare, and the 'knowledge' of templates, so I should investigate. In addition to a geometric analysis, I would also like to see reflexions on the nature of letter forms, semio/socio/psycho-logic aspects, poetic too, something like what Bachelard did for elements (space, fire, dreams) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Bachelard and such a reflection, I think, should come from a combination of art and science. A conceptual foundation for typography that would feed into/explain the choices designers make daily in their choices: why egyptian slabs on the word 'God'? Why should the official printout of the european constitution have high ascenders?..etc.

@Nick: in what I have seen, most analysis of type is done of the "external" side of type. Let's define the "internal" side of type as the conceptual/abstract definition of letter forms, the "templates": e.g. an "o" is a circle, or vertical ellipse.  The "external" aspect of type is about the surrounding aspects: counter size, ellipse direction, overhang dimension, natural/grunge aspects as you mention them,..etc. It's the internal aspects I'm interested about. I agree with you and the others that a geometric analysis of the external aspects doesn't lead far.

@DTY: very interesting, however I would ask an Artificial Intelligence team to go further: let's assume we have a group of A.I. beings, who are communicating orally with a basic language, then let's make them mute but let's give them the ability to draw.. what sort of shapes would they draw in order to communicate? In other words, what are the cognitive factors at play in the construction of a written language?

There are templates, but there is ZERO evidence that they are significantly geometric, and as Riccard0 says, all attempts to invoke pure geometric analysis have been failed post-hoc rationalizations.

Also, this discussion seems to be very western-centric. Note that there are plenty of writing systems (e.g. Chinese and Japanese) where this geometric fixation would be simply laughable, nobody could take it seriously, but there are also likely other writing systems where it would actually apply.

Yes - add Arabic to the scripts where it would be difficult to impose a geometric straight jacket to define *the* ideal shape of a given letter. Various scripts do have their rules - for example the height of the aleph in thuluth script is defined by so many dots aligned beside it (picture)  but this applies only to that script. In my AlQuds sans serif I instinctively tried to find the ideal generic shape for each letter, distilled from the most commonly used traditional scripts, but no geometrical template was used.

		<div class="commentbody">@Thomas: By template, I mean a visual template, a sort of abstract 2D wireframe, or a cloud made of the series of acceptable/recognisable shapes for a letter, so by 'template' I mean a geometric one so I'm not sure what you understood by templates not being geometric. And it's not necessarily about defining things with exact precision, but saying: a lowercase "c" is basically a left-side ellipse, has _those_ relations between the "i" and the "o", has _these_ characteristics compared to a "g".. and why does it need a terminal and/or a finial instead of being clear-cut at its center? For reasons of history or legibility? Is the "c" the easiest letter to write by hand, as it looks like it's part of a group of letters that don't need much ink/pixels? (hence: definition of letter "mass": does this exist?).. Amusing fact: the first word of the bible in yiddish is "Bereishit": בְּרֵאשִׁית which starts with a בְּ because, from what someone told me, it has an opening shape, like a uppercase "C"..
As you can imagine, those questions or reflections are not related to particular (western) types, but to the abstract form of a letter, I'm just wandering who has written what about this kind of things.
And I agree it's completely western-centric, as I have no familiarity with other alphabets. One does with what one has. 
But whatever the origin, an alphabet implies the ability to recognise a letter, visually (= geometrically), so the concept would still apply. 

@Vladimir: thank you again, and it's a beautiful image that you've added. If you have sources for ignorant westerners to understand arabic scripts/alphabets, I'd be happy to look at them.

@rs_donsata: I have a book, "the Art of Hand Lettering" by Helm Wotzkow, published in 1952, which is very humbling: imagine having to do draw by hand, and by hand only, perpetrating those school exercises every day in your professional life..</div>

Following this, this is not very geometric:
<img src="http://www.vangoghexhibition.com/wp-content/themes/vangogh/img/intro_before.med.jpg"></img>
In comparison, all alphabets are very geometric. 
Maybe you thought of one of the more reduced views of the word, geometry as opposed to the emotional characters of a sign, as in the sense of a 'geometric font' like Futura, geometric in the sense of cold and symmetric. 
Again my point of view is basic, abstract. All alphabets are made of sign, each written sign needs to be both clearly different from other signs ('u' is not 'v') and clearly identifiable as an instance of an abstract sign ('u' is a 'u' and not just a curve). There are tensions of different amplitudes, symmetries, exclusions,..etc between shapes that exist beyond the particulars of a type design...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a cognitive issue. You need to dig into perception, pattern recognition, and even language development. Typography is at it's root a system of marks that are symbols, and the "apprehensibility" of those marks, from a "mark qua letterform" perspective is largely a function of their relationship to other marks of similar form or style, with your brain doing the required processing to "decode" them into language. That's why a single "g" from a highly stylized font might look like nothing (and not adhere to any usual or customary definition) but be recognizable as a "g" in the context of words so similarly styled.

It's related in a way to why you can read this:

Here are three solutions of how to convert digital text into typography, each of which required, and constitutes, a “geometric analysis of letters”. 

<strong>PostScript Type 1</strong>
This elucidated many geometric qualities of letters, in particular in the way that the invention of hinting—using nominal stem widths and alignment zones to control shape—was required to address the problem of coarse pixel screens. https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF

<strong>Metafont</strong>
Lines and splines.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont

<strong>Bitmap</strong>
A simpler approach to geometrizing the alphabet.
https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/call

I have also heard that the Bentons developed algorithms for optically scaling typefaces, at ATF in the early 20th century.

Not necessarily.  Reading that, an image of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs came to mind and in fact someone has made such a font

Yes typographically the numerals in Latin fonts today needed to be redesigned to match Arabic fonts, but historically I see that it was in the West that the numerals have retained their essential forms over a millinium, while they evolved to match the Arabic script in the Arab/Islamic world!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Suijin: There are cognitive aspects to what I am looking for, and a reflection on letter shapes alone needs a complement of psychological studies (as you mentioned: pattern recognition, language development) if we were to make a proposition to alter our alphabet or language structure. Look at the example you gave: a study showing our capacity to understand words in which the orders of letters is randomised: it's an interesting study, but doesn't it feel that we're only at the beginning of something? Taking my personal interest and point of view: are there psychological studies on our capacity of recognition of specific abstract shapes, e.g. do we better recognise a series of circles, points, or segments? What are the pros and cons or using a stylised 'g' (a complex form) versus a simple one? Do we better recognise the 'g' (which I think is the most complex letter - geometrically speaking) or a 'o' or 'i'? 
Many aspects, related but distinct from typography as we usually see it.

@Nick: thank you again for those references. Being a software engineer myself, I'll read them a bit more, however they all are concerned with the exercise of rendering letters digitally, which I don't find very fascinating. Solutions based on restricted technology get always quickly outdated. I wonder for instance how the latest screen technologies (e.g. Apple Retina) changed the techniques of hinting or antialiasing, but it's not very exciting. 

@Vladimir: yesssss for colored animated 3d types, and at first, dynamic intelligent ligatures, smart poly-angular italics, poly-size bold, colors that detect and adapt to background. I want to type "Here beginneth the story of..." and I want my text editor to draw me something like:

		<div class="commentbody">@Nick: Readability is the ease with which a written text can be understood by a reader. It refers to entire words, sentences, and paragraphs, and encompass a wide variety of factors such as the text content, the language,..etc. Legibility is closer to may aim, as it is the degree to which individual characters in text are understandable or recognisable based on appearance. Readability is influenced, among other factors, by font choice, point size, kerning, tracking, line length, leading, and justification. However, I would be interested in a degree below entire letters: I want to know the brain reaction to basic geometric elements: circle, vertical segment, horizontal,..etc. I want to tie this analysis to a semantic analysis: history of signs/shapes, psychology, sociology,..etc. I want the beginning of an awareness of a vision of what an "|" provokes, how well it is recognised, and why "–" should or should not be used and why. I want to say "the letter A should be drawn like ∆ because.. and ∫ should replace s because...

@Vladimir: I'm not looking to create a font, or a software to create fonts, but a I'd like a tool that lets me do geometric calculations I need, I'm just not sure what to use... I could try FontLab and develop my extensions in Python, but there might be tools better suited for this. Do you know? I could perhaps use FontLab to extract path points, or even calculate wireframes out of existing fonts, but I'm not sure.

		<div class="commentbody">@Nick: you may not think glyphs matter, I believe they do. I believe recognising a glyph, any glyph, into a letter, is only the tip of an iceberg. I'd like at least to convince you that each glyph has a poetic substance, is a fantastic source for childhood imagination, a monument to be celebrate. It shouldn't be hard, for a visual audience such as yours. So here are some random thoughts: Haven't you ever felt that the uppercase P or F were in danger of falling? Do you sense the majesty of the A, Eiffel tower, star of the alphabet. The B is so fat it's not even funny. One can't spell slim, thin, and lean with it. Glyphs have friends: p,q,d,b make a gang, x and o conspire in secret. Who will write the eternal beauty of an H, ladder to Heaven? Who will say there's simply something wrong and awkward with k, r and Q? 
More seriously, is our alphabet geometrically sound? In the sense of: is there a geometric balance between all letters or are some letters very different from each other while some are very (too) similar to each other? I am surprised by the purity of x and o and their opposition, and I wonder if the resemblance of m and n and u may be a (hidden, taboo) legibility issue. What shapes does our alphabet ignore? The tree letters c, u, n have open counters going right, up, down, but why not (suspending our anthropocentric judgement) a letter with a left one, like a b without a stem? 
(I'm not trying to be clear - just throwing a few thoughts to express why I care about those abstract shapes.)

In one episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, an alien language is displayed on an interactive screen as images of rotating balls with colored patterns on them.

<cite>The objection to using these forms entirely unchanged - ie without being redesigned typographically to adapt to the style weight, serif or sans etc., of the Arabic or Hindu or whatever font it is used in- still stands.</cite>

One certainly could borrow the numerals from any number of Latin typefaces designed to simulate Arabic or Chinese, or even just from a calligraphic typeface.

I can think, though, of a number of reasons this option was rejected.

Since Arabic does have its own set of digits, it may have been thought that the foreign ones <em>should</em> stand out, so that people don't get too comfortble with them. And an attempt to stylistically Orientalize the Western digits could well have been perceived as patronizing and so on. Or, in a more pragmatic vein, since those weren't the forms people were taught from childhood to recognize, if they don't stand out as alien, they have the potential to cause confusion and slow reading.

When English texts include words in Greek, Hebrew, Chinese, or some other language with a different script, ordinary typefaces for those scripts are used - often, the equivalent of Century Expanded for the Latin script: the plainest and most standard typeface one can find.

In the hot metal era, that would simply be all that the printer would have on hand. (For Greek, there is a particular convention, known as Porson Greek, with its own history.)

There is no temptation to handle those scripts with a hyper-Latinized typeface so that they will "fit in" visually with the surrounding text.

If a paragraph suddenly contained, say, a word or phrase in heavily Latinized Gujarati... say (and the Gujarati script happens to lend itself to such treatment, with relatively simple forms and no Devanagari overbar - and I've seen it done too for display typography in that language)... unless context were to indicate the language likely to be used, the reader would likely be utterly perplexed as to what language these strange symbols might belong.

Come to think of it, this is an indictment of the "unified" sans-serif typefaces currently being designed for mobile devices, which are the subject of another recent thread: they may be great for their intended purpose in user interfaces, but they are probably <strong>not recommended</strong> for (the kind of) scholarly publication (that includes interspersed quotes from different languages).</div>

I DIDN’T SAY THAT!!!!!

This is what I said:
“I don’t think that the shape of individual glyphs is particularly important, we are very adept at decoding symbols. What is important in type design is how the glyphs combine.”

The way it is, it doesn’t matter WTF individual glyphs look like (as long as they bear a passing resemblance to the alphabet and are fairly consistent), the horizontal metrics can make “good” glyphs work poorly, or “bad” glyphs work well. I’m surprised that, as a type designer, you didn’t know that :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Nick: The "how the glyphs combine" part is always affected by the shape of individual glyphs, e.g. there is no way to combine a "I" (uppercase i) with a "l" (lowercase L) intelligently without altering the shape of each glyph (picking a font with the right serifs, width,..etc) and this is due to the alphabetic mistake of having two identical abstract shapes. As a graphic designer making a poster, you'll amend your font choice, as a type designer, you'll work on I and l, and in my particular goal - as a.. glyph analyst - you'll think hard about why two completely different sounds should be represented with the same shape, why it has been this way, what it means, where the little dot on the i (so cute) comes form and why is it lost in uppercase and why not keeping it, and couldn't we keep the lower stem "_" of "L" in the lowercase form...etc. I totally concur my goal has less immediate application that traditional typography, just like every other analytics exercise, it's about observing something that looks unessential, and trying new things, like tasting sea salt, or rock salt, or pickling salt, and making dishes with each (http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/cooking/six-types-salt). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">LePierre, it doesn’t matter that I and l are the same character shape, context will usually disambiguate them.

They were different shapes prior to typography, but ironically, from your perspective, type design has brought them closer together, because of both the recognition of textual context for providing meaning, and typography’s ability to nuance the basic shapes with details that relate to how the bicameral (upper and lower case) system has evolved, namely stem thickness, relative height, and serif treatment.

So the identicality of I and l is not a bug, but a feature that contributes to the overall readability of typography—although not of course individual glyph legibility.

I would argue that, assessing the pros and cons of the simple vertical line as a glyph shape for two separate characters, the economy and simplicity of this shape is so powerful that the efficiency (both in execution and recognition) obtained by using it outweighs the drawbacks. This is what design is, a compromise (or transcendent raprochement) between competing criteria, in this instance legibility and readability.

The same principal has allowed us to identicalize the character forms of O, o, zero, degree and ring, distinguishing them with subtle, typographically meaningful transformations of the basic round shape, without resorting to making any of them heart-shaped.</div>

I could not disagree more strongly, and I would say the research significantly contradicts the first half of your statement.

As for the second part, although it is *also* important how the glyphs combine, to the extent that the relative contributions to legibility have been specifically studied, it appears to be quite a lot less important than the individual glyph shapes. If you're talking relative importance, you have it backwards.

Sorry I don't remember the specific study right now. It's the last one mentioned in the relevant chapter of Sofie Beier's book on legibility. I think it was 2011, an Italian sounding name starting with an R perhaps. But I just loaned out my copy of the book last night.  :(

I should also say that any discussion of the relevant contributions and importance of two variables is dependent on the population variability of each variable. So for example, if you create a font by taking glyphs from a totally random or unrelated set of fonts, you'll suddenly "discover" that how the glyphs combine makes a huge difference. But within the norms of type design, according to the one study on the topic, it was more like 3:1 for individual glyphs over any higher-level effects.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you have misinterpreted what I meant by “combine”; perhaps I should have said “are configured to form a coherent system”.

I attempted to explain this with the example of the straight line (I, l and 1, and for that matter hyphen, dashes, macron and underscore) and circle/oval (O, o, zero, degree and ring).

As individual symbols, the circles are identical, and easy to categorize and identify as such. That is legibility. But which character does this shape, once discerned, signify? For the type designer, the circularity is a given, and the important task, for disambiguation, is both to make sure they are not confused, and also to harmonize their treatment stylistically. 

In a typeface comprised entirely out of straight lines, these nominally circular or oval characters become quadrilateral, yet this conceit is taken in stride by the reader. Again, it is the type designer’s task to make sure that a particular shape is recognized as a specific character, and this is done by typographic means, in relation to the typeface as a whole.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if you want to say that the shapes of the other glyphs in a font affect one's ability to decode a glyph, of course I agree. The reason that a nearly-closed "C" shape is a problem is that it generally looks like an "O."

Another consideration is that the norms matter, as well as the actual other shapes in the font. You can make a U that looks a lot like a V, and even if the actual V in that particular font is different and distinctive, it is still a legibility issue.</div>

Contradict how? I certainly believe that the alternate a is significantly less legible than the default one. The alternate g slightly so. But those are alternates, not the default forms, and Hypatia Sans is primarily a display face anyway. Although I certainly was interested in making it reasonably legible, <em>maximum</em> legibility was definitely not part of the design brief. (Not that there was a formal written design brief.)

Also I suppose it depends on your definition of “not particularly important.” Agreed that people are capable of decoding some pretty extreme things in letterforms. Not to mention a lot of variation that we consider within the normal range, including the “C” and “689” from Helvetica and the single-story a in countless fonts. But “capable of decoding” letterforms, even  relatively quickly and easily in small amounts when context provides adequate clues, does not mean that it works in all situations or that it would be a great choice for extensive body text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I remember the Hebrew proverb that truth stands more firmly than falsehood, based on the shapes of the letters in the two words - the letters in "truth" (emeth, or אמת ) being like n, and the letters in "falsehood" (sheker, or שקר ) being like r. (From a Google search for the actual Hebrew words involved, I now know where I remember that <em>from</em>: David Kahn's book <em>The Codebreakers</em>; I really am not deeply versed in such matters.) I don't think it is valuable, or anything more than an idle amusement, to assign <em>that</em> kind of significance to the shapes of individual letters.

Not being able to easily distinguish between zero and the letter O, or the numeral one, lower-case L, and upper-case i, at least in isolation, certainly <em>can</em> be a problem.

		<div class="commentbody">And Nick: "Il lit Lillit, murmure un mime." is a French sentence I amused myself to create (as Quadibloc said, it is amusing to play with shapes) containing repetitions of similar shapes. Fonts can make those shapes appear different as you noted, but is this constraint, this requirement of typographers to draw similarly-looking shapes differently, an absolute constraint, immanent in whatever alphabet we would have? In other words, is the set of our letter shapes sufficiently geometrically balanced and sound that we are not forcing on ourselves some completely arbitrary and absurd restriction? I'm only wondering if we can measure this. You're saying that our capability to recognise glyphs, supported by their context, is enough. I'm not so sure. Nobody created the alphabet saying that it was good, well founded, sensible: it's just a limited set of arbitrary shapes that typographers are forced to play with. 
Imagine an alphabet only made of different "o" shapes, this would be a rather stupid one, and typographers would have quite a constraint there. The other extreme would be an alphabet made of shapes structurally the most different from one another as possible (something like "|, o, X, %, €"). Who has invented imaginary alphabets?

Yes, but the alphabet very slowly and gradually developed over time.

Some of the developments are hard to understand. The ancient Phoenician alphabet seems, to modern eyes accustomed to the Latin alphabet, to be quite legible - and it developed into the Greek alphabet and then the Latin one, legible as well by that standard.

But other descendants include the Hebrew square script, which has several glyph pairs that are hard to distinguish, Arabic script, with multiple glyphs distinguished only by added dots, and the elaborate offspring of the Brahmi script, itself plain and legible.

The explanation for the Arabic script, at least, is obvious - ease of writing, as with, say, Pitman shorthand. Some Indic scripts are also explicable, like one constrained by the need to write on palm leaves. But it's hard to justify what, for example, the Siamese have inflicted on themselves.

How could such a script have developed, with each incremental step being "better" than the one before? Of course, part of the issue is that the question "better for what purpose" may be missed. If mass literacy is not the goal, but a dignified presentation of traditional religious texts, an elaborate script is not an issue.</div>

Arbitrary, perhaps, if “ghoti” can spell “ﬁsh”.
But not in the sense that the shapes of the Latin alphabet have evolved based on vertical, horizontal and diagonal straight lines, and curves, with the lower case derived from shapes that have a certain amount of efficiency and ﬂow when written cursive.

Alphabets are constructs of the hive mind, with some exceptions.
Cyrillic, and perhaps Korean.
More *logical* phonetic alphabets, such as the Shavian and ITA alphabets, those are hard to implement.
The alphabet does change though, when the individual initiatives go viral.
Trissino’s advocacy of adding /v and /j caught on, if not /ω.
And more recently, the sans serif has been responsible for single bowl /a and /g becoming acceptable.
And even more recently, we ﬁnd lower case /l with a tail.

Always options: for instance /W with crossing centre strokes, or /y based on /u with a tail.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for mentioning Trissino; because of your post, I searched for more information, and was ultimately able to find this

[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=jcVKAAAAcAAJ]]

on the web - the book in which he suggested several augmentations to the alphabet, of which only J and V were accepted.

EDIT: I trusted Wikipedia a bit too much; the new alphabet was used in this book about the nature of the Italian language, but the reformed spelling was actually proposed and advocated in <em>this</em> book:

or perhaps this

is a more complete copy.

Here are the five additional letters he proposed to add to the alphabet:

These letters were taken from two different spots in the work, one which gave the upper-case forms of the new letters, and another which gave the whole new alphabet in lower case.

Also, I have retouched them. In the case of the upper-case omega, I took off a burr probably caused by sticky dry ink or whatever; in the case of the lower-case j, I filled in a break caused by a lack of ink.

But in the case of the lowercase alternate z, I was more shameless - I stretched the bottom of the letter (by one pixel) so as to separate the two pieces of the letter that were touching at the top, so that what I believed to be its actual shape could be clearly seen.

EDIT: On reviewing the document, I found I misidentified the glyph that was the lowercase counterpart of the alternate z; in fact, that pair of glyphs should be:

However, Trissino is not the inventor of the letter ç - in fact, the Wikipedia article on the cedilla notes that the accent originated as the tail of a cursive Z, and so Trissino simply borrowed the older form, somewhere between the Visigoths and his Iberian contemporaries.</div>
