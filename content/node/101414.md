  the following article on the Internet: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/10/31/2521315/the-forgotten-golden-age-of-mixed-martial-arts-part-iv-ultimate\r\n\r\nIf
  you scroll down a little you'll see the attached image. \r\n\r\nTo me, it looks
  like it was an image of a subheads from an old newspaper articles and then integrated
  into the design of the page for a faux aged effect. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrestler_v_boxer_3825.png]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
