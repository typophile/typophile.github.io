<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I need oppinions if it's a good choice of style, since I want to go a little <em>vintage</em> on his one.
The play is about hippies and all that crap. I have the concept for the poster already, I just need to execute the idea, and this is the one thing that I'm not sure about. The poster is inspired by blotter art, and will essentially <strong>be</strong> a sheet of blotter with this logotype underneath the blotter (I am planning to take out the pieces of the actuall blotter so you can see the logotype, like a puzzle).
Oh, and the play is called "The Grateful Alive", yeah as in "The Grateful Dead". :)
I need (with your help I hope) yet to figure out the placement for the "The" and the "Alive". I'm thinking: "The"--top left, "Alive"--bottom right. But I'm not sure about the style.
Any help appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>I kinda like the look but would look at a Capital G. That era you didn't need graphics to balance in terms of shape, you only had to make them fit.
I was actually at the original Woodstock</div>

Whooohoo, really?! That had to be really cool experience. So do you remember any of it? (Just kidding :))
I have considered a capital G myself, but this is just the first draft, as you can see I didn't even bother to fit it to the sheet of paper. :)
I will post a followup the day after tomorrow, I won't have internet access for about 24hrs.
I was kinda thikning to throw in a fat outline (not too fat though) and adding a "3D"--graffiti like 3D, to go aroud 3-4cm to the south. Also some shading on it.
I'm just typing what I'm thinking right now, we'll see ...
Thanx for taking the time to respond.

<div class=commentbody>Hi people, I apologise for resurecting an old topic, but I just wanted to report an update to my project.
Here's the preview of the yet unfinished poster. I am interested in comments on the logotype itself as I think this is it, and also advices for the typeface for the "misc. information" (sorry, I don't know the rigth term, names of the actors and such).
As you can see it is in the bottom right now in Helvetica bold, but I don't plan on leaving it in Helvetica.
Suggestions anyone?

<div class=commentbody>I like it but substitute the v symbol with a hand holding a daisy. The v symbol was used in that era but it was also used as the victory symbol by Churchill in WWII. The daisy was a pacifist symbol for peace.
Now on the type "The would never be on a straight line It would follow the curve of the characters below. The h would drop and tuck under the t and get larger and the e would follow the curve and become larger (filling the space). These posters were hand drawn and they took liberties to fake spacing. The second l in gratefull looks like a t. Once again make Alive fill the shape and follow the curve. Destortion is a good thing for 60s a look. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanx for your reply Dan, I completely agree on the distortion comments. The minute I posted it here I thought to myself: "Man, this has to flow better.". :)
As far as I know, "grateful" is spelled with one L, or have I just made myself the biggest ass on the forum? :)
PS
The comment for the v symbol stands as well. You know so much about this Dan, I have surely learned a lot, so thanx once again, you've been really helpfull.
The whole logotype was actually hand-drawn and then hand-traced, so I might look into the freehand option as well.

<div class=commentbody>The and Alive and the G are much more of the genre you are trying to recreate, your first post is more along the right lines, your other characters are a little bit blackletter meets art nouveau. The swash on the bottom of the t is hindering recognition, you could look at bringing the f down to link to the swash and have the t as a more recognisable character, btw your a & e counters look white rather than the background pattern
You are right about the spelling of Grateful.
As for the v sign (although it wouldn't be ideal for the UK*) I think, given the context and style of the poster, you can use it if it doesn't have any local cultural connotations beyond peace.
Tim
*I first thought you were telling the Grateful Alive to go forth and multiply (or rather a more Anglo-Saxon term)</div>

<div class=commentbody>FYI-
Just from an historic point of view, here are two of the only "Grateful Dead" posters I could spot that used a forms somewhat similar to your treatment.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grateful_Dead1.jpg]For New Year's Concert Dec. 31, 1991
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grateful_Dead1b.jpg]1967. Artist -- Robert Fried
Most of the "Dead Heads" relate these styles of lettering classic Greatful Dead as used in these posters of mid-sixties.

That's exactly what my professor said when he saw the initial sketch, but I have never seen those posters, although I was going for that kind of "look and feel". Anyhow those posters are incredible!
