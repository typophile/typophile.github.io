    falls to the floor.  A silhouette takes shape, cut out of bright daylight outside.\r\n\r\nBoots.
    \ Gun.  Hat.  The Sheriff takes a few well-placed heavy steps, hand placed on
    his holster as a warning.  The townsfolk can't decide whether the proper reaction
    should be silence or chatter.\r\n\r\nSii, the sheriff, quickly draws his gun of
    sarcasm, pulls the hammer back with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\"I hear talk you're asking
    folk here for free typefaces\" he says, before spitting on the floor, \"what do
    you call yourself stranger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm saratyp,\" says the stranger in a bold
    comic sans voice, \"I don't see what the problem is, I wasn't going to hurt nobody....\"\r\n\r\n"
