body: I was searching around for a typeface to use in a magazine I am creating for
  my final advanced type project. <BR> <BR><a href="http://tinyurl.com/42556">AUTO
  by Underware</a> <BR> <BR>AUTO was the one I found that seemed the best suited to
  what I was doing with my project. The magazine is focused on design and indie music,
  discussing packaging - posters - old vinyl - ephemera - etc. <BR> <BR>The price
  tag for AUTO is WAY to high for a personal/student project so I wondered if you
  great typophiles had some suggestions for body type that was in the same vein and
  feel as AUTO - but in a much lower price range, or &#40;yeah right&#41; free. <BR>
  <BR>THANKS guys and gals <BR> <BR>shawn
