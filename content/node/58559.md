  body: 'Good list from aaronbell. One of my suggestions is from that list "Type:
    The Secret History of Letters" and the bibel of typography "The Elements of Typographic
    Style" but that''s a bit heavy to begin with. But at first focus on the historical
    part of type, and buy a "good" book on caligraphy or stonecut letters "origin
    of the serif" from Edward Catich maybe. Studying the history of type lays a solid
    foundation because thats where it started, with glyphs and typefaces.'

  body: "Your question is pretty vast, Alex. Are you trying to learn about fonts because
    you plan to be a graphic designer, or because you want to design typefaces, or
    because ... [insert alternate option here]? Depending on your answer to that question,
    you might get different recommendations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you are just starting
    out as a user of fonts or typefaces, you might want to begin with the latest edition
    of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Essential-Guide-Typography/dp/0823014134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1244087699&sr=1-1\"><em>Designing
    with Type: The Essential Guide to Typography</em></a>, by James Craig, or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Stealing-Sheep-Find-Works/dp/0201703394/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1244087992&sr=1-1\"><em>Stop
    Stealing Sheep & find out how type works</em></a>, by Erik Spiekermann and E.M.
