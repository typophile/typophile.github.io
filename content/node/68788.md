  countries. I just wondered what the best solution is around fonts displaying and
  printing in various languages. Should most typefaces from somewhere such as linotype
  support this? What should I look for?\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: It all depends <em>which</em> languages. If your client is thinking of French
    and German then yes, most typefaces will support this. If your client is thinking
    of Japanese and Urdu, then no, most typefaces will not.

    FontShop newsletter</a>. It shows which languages are covered (European at least)
    by most font versions.

    Nick: there are a lot of Latin-script using languages that are not covered by
    those fonts, which focus on European languages and only accidentally support some
    other languages. Yes, these fonts are a big improvement on those that only supported
    major Western European languages, but it's a big world with a lot of Latin-script
    alphabets and diacritic letters to account for."

  body: "Giles,\r\n\r\nJohn H is right, it is a big world out there for latin script
    languages. And while most of us are trying to include as large a character set
    as is economically feasible, there is some latin-script language support that
    is not complete in an off-the-shelf-font. My advice would be to identify the fonts
    you desire and see if those font developers are interested in adding any missing
    glyphs you may need. It doesn't hurt to ask.\r\n\r\nJames M"

    European</em> Latin-script using languages\".\r\nThat seems to be the situation
    with most foundries that offer fonts with extended Latin-script language support.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it all depends on the scope of languages / scripts you require. Andron
    Mega currently covers about 300 languages, both extinct and major/minor recent
    ones. At least for the Latin-related and Cyrillic-related languages you\u2019ll
    find an utmost comprehensive coverage provided. Please check [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=280&changelang=2|this
    alphabetical list of languages]]. (I still need to update it with the most recent
    UDHR samples.) "
