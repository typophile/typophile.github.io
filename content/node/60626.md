  body: "The \"Normandie\" part is close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic/|Garage
    Gothic]],\r\nthe other text looks Futura/Neutraface-ish, the latter even has the
    unique Q."

  body: "Hi Lathen,\r\n\r\nno fonts involved, this was all done by hand.\r\nCheck
    out [[Mark Simonson]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostranuova.html\">Mostra
    Nuova</a>. It has a number of alternates, including the circular \u2018G\u2019
    with horizontal bar, and the \u2018Q\u2019 with the centered vertical cauda.\r\nFor
    \u2018Normandie\u2019, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster_collection/block_gothic_bold_condensed/?&sample_text=NORMANDIE\">Block
    Gothic</a> is the closest font I could find.\r\nF"
