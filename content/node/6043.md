  of ordinals. Any help would be appreciated.

  body: Hmmm. Hold everything, then. <BR>Are you using a small point size? If so,
    are you using the correct optical master? Because if you&#39;re setting a small
    size with an optical master for larger sizes&#42; that would explain InDesign&#39;s
    optical spacing using up a lot more room than the Metric setting, but that would
    also mean it&#39;s preferable. <BR> <BR>&#42; Does the setting look cramped and
    anemic? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: You&#39;re applying ordinals globally, which you shouldn&#39;t be. Only format
    as ordinals the specific bits of text you want to have ordinals. &#40;Same holds
    true for fractions, btw.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

  body: Don&#39;t apply discretionary ligatures to ordinals... that&#39;s the problem
    with 1st. I&#39;m not sure if Adobe could have built the fonts features in such
    a way as to avoid this, but it&#39;s easy to work around it. <BR> <BR>As to &#34;Notification&#34;,
    I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s happening. Check what Opentype features you have
    active, and deselect them until it&#39;s ok.

  body: Thanks John and Thomas. <BR> <BR>Ordinals are definitely the problem. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s going to take a while finding all the ordinals to apply on a case
    by case basis with about 160pp. Any ideas on doing this? Is find and replace a
    good way to find the characters I&#39;ll need to change? <BR> <BR>Thomas - If
    I took off discretionary ligatures would it be possible to apply the ordinals
    globally? <BR> <BR>Thanks again everyone.

  body: Nope. You&#39;d still have the problem with &#34;Notification.&#34; That&#39;s
    the &#34;numero&#34; kicking in. <BR> <BR>By the way, the problem with the discretionary
    ligatures overriding the ordinals is a font bug, and could have been avoided by
    better feature construction. I filed the bug against the font, and hope to get
    it fixed in some future revision. Sorry about that. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
