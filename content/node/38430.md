  body: "Do some google searching on OU's website--most schools are pretty careful
    nowadays about describing the precise nature of their logos because it is regarded
    as their brand. Often, you'll even find the schools telling you how to replicate
    the logo in terms of font, size, color and usage in some detail.\r\n"

  body: Or better yet, if you need the logo, download something with it, like say,
    a sports schedule, and open the PDF in Illustrator, and voila, you have your logo,
    90% of the time.
