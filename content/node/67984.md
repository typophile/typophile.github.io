body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the identity of a font that was used for maintenance
  markings on German aircraft during WW2. I've tried seeing if the font is any of
  the DIN (Deutsche Industrie Norm, [German Industrial Standard]) set of typefaces
  but to no avail. I also checked it against the original Futura although very close
  it appears to be in between a condensed and a regular version of the typeface. Could
  it be a custom typeface designed for the Messerschmitt factory? My knowledge of
  Typography is slightly limited and I was wondering if any of you guys could assist?
  I've posted below some samples of the typeface taken from original factory documents.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nWarm Regards\r\n\r\nClint Mitchell\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your prompt replies. I did check it against Futura by Neufville
    Digital. Apparently they completely digitized the typeface from the original sources
    of the Bauersche Giesserei, now held by FT Bauer in Barcelona. I had my suspicions
    that it was Futura but it is slightly wider than the condensed version but not
    as wide as the regular. Is there an inbetween version?\r\n\r\nThanks Again.\r\n\r\nClint"

    Appears wider in the factory versions.\r\n\r\nClint"
