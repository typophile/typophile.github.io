  be, we all know what a 'h' looks like).\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend any good books
  that give a through grounding in type design?  I have a copy on Fontlab Studio but
  I'm eager to at least find out what hinting means before I absently start drawing
  glyphs."

  body: "Hi Paul,\r\n\r\nI'm just starting out with type design too, so I'm sure others
    will offer recommendations and opinions from more \"expert\" perspectives; that
    said, I'd like to recommend two books that have been helping me a lot along the
    way of designing my first typeface.\r\n\r\nDesign-wise, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231351070&sr=8-1\">Designing
    Type</a> by Karen Cheng is quite a thorough walk-through through sans & serif
    upper- and lowercase letters as well as numerals. She presents the letters in
    different typefaces, and points out design concerns relevant to them, how to approach
    them and what to keep in mind. I've found it quite helpful (especially when complemented
    by looking at, and analyzing, existing typefaces oneself).\r\n\r\nOn the more
    technical side, I think the universally accepted best introduction to FontLab
    is Leslie Cabarga's <a href=\"http://www.logofontandlettering.com/\">Learn FontLab
    Fast</a>, which on a side note, looks quite cramped, but works very well in introducing
    the workflow and tools available in FontLab.\r\n\r\nHave fun. :-)"

    jobs ?\r\nWell, sure if you are one of those people who are (or wants to be) assertive
    (or challenging) about software, you should build your own hardware."

  body: "Nina, thanks for those suggestions, I'll certainly check out those books.\r\n\r\nAlessandro,
    various type libraries have kept me interested and (hopefully) creative in the
    ten years I've been working as a graphic designer, and I've now formed strong
    opinions on what I like and dislike.  It was for this reason that I started to
    think about designing my own type, it seemed the next logical step.\r\n\r\nJelmar,
    rest assured.  I\u2019m not that arrogant!\r\n"
