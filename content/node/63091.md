  piece..\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com/storage/Final-Zapf-Layout.pdf\">HERMANN
  ZAPF LAYOUT PDF</a>\r\n\r\nHere is the criteria for the assignment:\r\n+ Format
  (7.5 by 10.5 inches)\r\n+ It all must fit on a spread\r\n+ About six images (I have
  5)\r\n+ It should represent a possible layout for an entire textbook about typography/type
  designers/type history\r\n\r\nWhat I would like feedback on:\r\n+ Use of negative/white
  space (is there enough? Is it interesting?\r\n+ Type color (and I am not talking
  about the red)\r\n+ Relevance and arrangement of images\r\n+ Use of footnotes, image
  captions and other secondary test\r\n+ Hierarchy\r\n+ General typographic style/following
  rules, appropriate glyphs, etc\r\n\r\nSome info about my design:\r\n+ its on a 5
  column grid.\r\n+ Text is set 9/13 x 13p4 (strange measure, I know) Scala and Scala
  Sans\r\n\r\nOh, and I have thick skin. Please don't hold back. Prompt feedback would
  be excellent. (Sorry about the second thread, I just need some feedback quickly)"

  body: i think it looks decent, I just had a little trouble with the captions, if
    you're going to put them all on one page maybe you should number the images so
    people can find the caption just a little bit quicker.

  body: Overall nice work. I think you need more space between the deck and the body
    copy, right now it runs together. Not sure about the flush right alignment on
    the captions, it gives the impression of being jammed in there next to the body
    copy, how did it look flush left? I think the 2 images on the right hand page
    are too large, they are running awfully close to the page edge. The body copy
    seems a bit tight in places, maybe those 2 columns should be slightly wider?
