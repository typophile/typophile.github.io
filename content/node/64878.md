body: "Disclaimer: I really don't know anything about typography. I'm just getting
  really OCD about the manuscript of the story I'm writing (\"writing\" being code
  for <em>toiling through</em>).\r\n\r\nIf you're in the en dash camp as opposed to
  the em dash (with regard to parenthetical thoughts, abrupt stops, etc.): How do
  you handle a dash at the end of a paragraph? It looks like books that use spaced
  en dashes mid-sentence opt for unspaced em dashes at the end of the paragraph. (The
  spaced en dash looks too airy to me in this situation.)\r\n\r\nYeah, succinctly
  wording written questions has never been my forte. Which of these examples are correct,
  if any?\r\n\r\nJohn said, \"Hi, I'm looking for\u2014\"\r\nvs.\r\nJohn said, \"Hi,
  I'm looking for \u2013\"\r\n\r\nJohn was looking for\u2014\r\nvs.\r\nJohn was looking
  for \u2013\r\n\r\nAlso (and I know the answer to this is blindingly obvious, but
  Google has failed me time and time again to the point where I'm ready to smash my
  forehead through my computer screen), how do you format an ellipsis followed immediately
  by closed quotation marks? Unless my memory is failing me, Bringhurst says the space
  in front of the ellipsis should be removed if the ellipsis is followed by other
  punctuation. Quotation marks?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nEdit:
  Bleh. For the project I'm working on, I may just chicken out and dot-space-dot-space-dot
  my ellipses. I'm using Bookman Old Style and I'm not sure I like the look of tiny
  dot-dot-dot next to those big, waddling, page-swallowing characters, and I can't
  be bothered to switch fonts for a larger ellipsis or whatever. (See? I have no idea
  what I'm doing.)"

  body: "My <cite>Penguin Guide to Punctuation</cite> says only this:\r\n\r\n<cite>\_\_\_In
    the rare case in which a sentence is broken off abruptly without being \_\_\_completed...the
    dash is written solid next to the unfinished piece-of-a-word \_\_\_which precedes
    it.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis rather makes me wonder whether your first example suggests
    the word for\u2014 has been cut short, whilst your second example suggests the
    following word has been stopped short. \r\n\r\nAlso, the first one looks to me
    like a faster interruption, whilst the second could indicate John was pausing
    slightly before listing what he was looking for, and was interrupted in his pause."

  body: Ah, thanks. I think the em is what I want then. I always assumed the dash
    just symbolizes that the word before it is the last out of the character's mouth.
    Regardless.
