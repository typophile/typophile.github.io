  I have no idea what this typeface could be, yet at the same time I'm certain I've
  seen it before. Obviously the colorful artifacts are added by the designer, still
  I recognize the typeface as it is -- without any proof that it does actually exist.\r\n\r\nI've
  chosen not to rotate the attached source image, due to respect for the designer
  (Kouglof, France). Most thankful for any input,\r\n\r\nJocke"
