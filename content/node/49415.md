body: Hi. I'm Diego Sanz Salas. I'm 24 years old peruvian designer. My first font
  is Sencilla. I'm working it at fontstruct.fontshop.com . You can download it at
  [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/4701]] . Now it has 1254 characters
  for Latin Extended, Greek Polytonic, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew and Arabic. I'm
  working now on Thai. I want to fix all the mistakes you could found. Please leave
  your commentaries here [[http://typophile.com/node/49355]] or in the fonstruct site.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sencilla_6726.gif]
