  and a question was raised as to whether we could use an AD ligature (as in A.D.
  or Anno Domini) in the text. I had never seen one and was curious to find out more
  about it.\r\n\r\nA quick search revealed <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/senorton/528084746/\">this
  Flickr photo</a> of the ligature on a bell in Boston. The quality of the photograph
  is terrible and that's all I was able to find.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone here is
  more familiar with this ligature and can point me to some other examples of it."

  body: I think it would feel strange in running text. I would use small caps instead.
