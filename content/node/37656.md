  project to do titled 'Difference'. I felt the subject was ideal for a forum discussion
  and figured posting it would generate good views on the subject from others.\r\n\r\nProject
  Brief:\r\nProduce a logo, 8 page exhibition brouchure and three panels for an exhibition
  in the Campus foyer which looks at the conflicting views of designers reguarding
  the use of personal style in the generation of communication design work. The debte
  was very much in evidence in the early 1980's with the increasing use of technology
  in creative production but it has been an underlying issue in the way designers
  have always worked. Your approach should be objective in illustrating the philosophies
  of both camps but stimulating enough to interest those who may not be aware of the
  difference in approach. As a major element of the exhibition is concerned with the
  role of type in design the final pieces should focus upon the application of type
  as an expressive medium with imagery forming an effective complement. \r\n\r\nI'm
  not so much looking for ideas for my outcome but was more interested in others views
  on the debate topic. If your not too aware of the debate here's a link to an article
  about it, though its from more of a web design point of view but the idea is still
  there www.adobe.com/designcenter/dialogbox/stylevsdesign . I was hoping by posting
  on this forum  I would be able to get perspectives from more of a typography stand
  point (I figured this forum would be a good source of views of typographers with
  much better experience/knowledge than myself). I look forward to any replies. Thanks"

  body: "I don't really see it as pretentious. The purpose of the project is to put
    forward the views of two sides of a debate. The idea is not to say that one side
    is correct over another - or to demean the way any designer operates. Its more
    about stimulating a healthy discussion about a topic within the design community.\r\nAlso
    to your point Nick - the sentence reads:\r\n\"The debate was very much in evidence
    in the early 1980\u2019s with <em>the increasing use of technology in creative
    production</em><strong> but it has been an underlying issue in the way designers
    have always worked.</strong>\r\nThe point about technology is only an aspect of
    it - a catalyst within the issue.\r\nAnyway, here is another article which I thought
    was an interesting read... see what ya think. www.alistapart.com/articles/bathingape/"

  body: "I think the two links I posted are a good read to get a better idea of the
    debate. I'm new to the issue myself and thats why I initially posted, to see others
    opinions so I'm not completely knowledgeable on the subject myself yet. In summary
    though, the issue is about designers using popular style in their designs or aesthetic
    appeal over the fundamental teachings of communication design. By fundamental
    teachings I mean proper font choice and usage, grid systems and hierarchies. A
    good example would be Josef Muller-Brockmann\u2019s seminal book \u201CGrid Systems
    In Graphic Design,\u201D. It speaks about the mathematical aspects of good communication
    design - how grid systems are essential in visual communication. Are designers
    forgetting about these aspects of design? - Its all well and good to create a
    piece that looks great, but if the message is lost then surely it makes it bad
    design.\r\nOn the other side of the coin you can argue that the designers style
    and aesthetic appeal is more important. If the design uses devices that relate
    to popular culture is that more important? An good example of this would be to
    look at raygun magazine. Its a magazine from the 80's 90's and had a different
    look for every spread - an interview was even printed in dingbats in one issue
    - obviously totally unreadable but in keeping with the style of the magazine.
    \r\nI don't know if this helps, maybe I'm not communicating the issue correctly.
    If anyone has any views on this though Id love to hear them. "

    and that is not to say that they are mutually exclusive.  Systems can be expanded
    upon, new systems can be created and they can be purposely ignored/abandoned.\r\n\r\nFoundations
    and general laws of what works or what has worked are important, as design is
    about connecting and communicating to a wider audience, but one shouldn't be suffocated
    by rules, and usually new ideas are introduced from those who aren't classically
    versed / haven't had their minds polluted with what is 'right' or 'wrong'.  Knowing
    the rules has value so long as personal intuition isn't lost.\r\n\r\nA lot of
    design application comes down to what needs to be said and who it's being said
    to.\r\n"

    what's the debate? Design is design, style is style. They're pretty well defined
    terms in the world of design. \r\n\r\nBoth of those articles aren't debating anything...they're
    just defining, yet again, the two terms.\r\n\r\n\"I don\u2019t know if this helps,
    maybe I\u2019m not communicating the issue correctly.\"\r\n\r\nI think you are...just
    that it's a rather vapid assignment, IMHO. Not your fault, of course. It seems
    more akin to pundit fodder than any sort of meaningful debate.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    I always like architecture analogies:\r\n\r\ndesign = space planning, the studs,
    the foundation, pipes, wiring, etc.\r\n\r\nstyle = aesthetic decisions for the
    walls, floors, fixtures, paints, art, furniture\r\n\r\nBoth are important for
    the success of the project. When one should have more emphasis than the other
    is entirely Dependant on the particular project/client goals/needs.\r\n"

  body: "I'm surprised by the resistance I'm reading in this thread. I don't know
    if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I'd expect more people to jump in.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    I agree that the \"project brief\" is badly written. I don't know how it was decided
    that there were exactly two opposing camps on the subject (and it doesn't even
    clearly state what the two camps believe, although I can guess).\r\n\r\nBut anyway,
    I do think this is a subject that can be, and has been, discussed. Personally,
    I don't think the discussion has much real-world value. One can worry about the
    correct amount of \"style\" to apply to one's design, but in the real world, it
    seems to me, there is a client, and audience, money, deadlines, ego, and all of
    that, which completely overrule any idea of what might be purely correct or proper.
    Design in the real world is part of a very complicated system, which in turn determines
    what is right and wrong.\r\n\r\nI mean, if one is a designer with a distinctive
    style, one will find that style is either a success or failure in the real world.
    The client/customer will like it or not. They will be willing to pay for it or
    not. It will be seen -- or not. It might successfully communicate (something),
    but if nobody ever sees it, then who cares?\r\n\r\nA designer can attempt to strip
    all distinctive style from their design, but it still has to get through that
    client firewall. It might communicate, but it might be dull.\r\n\r\nNow, as far
    as the purely academic question goes -- does a preponderance of style help or
    hinder effective communication? -- it depends, doesn't it? To some extent, the
    brain will respond to something it finds appealing, whether or not it is pure
    information or some stylistic artifice. Again, it's complicated. The real world
    decides."

    Graphic Design be taught in the Art College, or the Business College.\r\n\r\nI,
    like most (all?) graphic designers went to art school. But isn't Graphic Design
    really more about business communication? \r\n\r\nPerhaps that's the crux of the
    perceived debate...is graphic design 'art' or 'design'? It is, of course, both,
    but that's hardly a debate.\r\n\r\nI've always liked the term 'commercial artist'.
    Perhaps it's nostalgia, but it seems to better define what most of us do day-in/day-out
    to make a living."

    more thoughts. Good valid points made - the ideas behind the debate mentioned
    in the brief has been a stumbling block for me, it would have been nice if the
    debate was clarified in the brief. Last week I found it hard to start my design
    work as I didn't have a good idea of the information that I was supposed to be
    communicating (got slated by the tutor too about it). It still seems a bit of
    a grey subject area - not as black and white as the brief made out.\r\nI did read
    another article since the initial post that I found helpful - rather insightful
    and an interesting read. It focuses around the points made in the last few posts
    of art vs design. Here's the URL if you fancy a read - www.aiga.org/content.cfm/art-vs-design
    - It has a forum after the article too but I'd love to hear any thoughts about
    it in this forum. I was also wondering if anybody had any typographic views around
    the issue - Its a typographic project so I have to use type to try to convey the
    two sides of the debate - maybe there aren't any real typographic issues around
    the idea of style vs design but I thought I'd ask in case, and typophile seems
    to be the best place to do it."
