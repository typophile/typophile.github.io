body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI need your help to discover the font-family of the
  image i've enclosed. I don't know for sure if the font is custom made or not. I've
  tried to discover the font-family through font identifying websites, but they don't
  completely match. One looks like it pretty similar: Earthman Ext BB Bold Italic
  from Blambot Earthman BB.\r\n\r\nIf i don't discover the font-family, does anyone
  have good suggestions of software i can use to customize the font above?\r\n\r\nAll
  help is well appreciated..\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !\r\n"
