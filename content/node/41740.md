  stuff I've seen by Wijdeveld, but all the references I can find in my books point
  to something close but not similar... I've also seen stuff like it, much closer,
  at the NAi too, but obviously cannot just call them up :(\r\n\r\nAny help? (thanks
  for reading!!)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wij_4420.jpg]"

  body: Sure, tangram is close... what else? Like I said, this feels like a something
    from Wijdeveld, but has anyone else seen stuff like this? Modular geometry-like
    faces in any way close to it? I'm sure I've seen it elsewhere... might have to
    check the ILL...
