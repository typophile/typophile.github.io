    forum, where font ID requests are not favored-- as it says on the forum description
    page...\r\n\r\nInstead, you want the FontID page. Shortcuts to that are reversed
    out in white in the black banner at the top of every page, and also in the right
    column,  in red, second one after the display of  your user name...\r\n\r\nThat
    will take you to the right spot."
