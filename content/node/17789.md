  the program. I only get a kind of bitmap translation of the outlines instead of
  smooth outlines. I have two postscript laserprinters and both have the same problems.
  I do have a G5 and a G4 PowerBook and on both machines I have the same problem.
  Does someone have/had the same problems?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nPieter\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bitmapinsteadofsmooth.gif]"

  body: "The underlying source code of FontLab Fontographer 4.7 is largely the same
    as of the older Macromedia Fontographer 4.1. The program code has been \"carbonized\",
    i.e. adapted from the Classic runtime environment to the OS X-compatible Carbon
    runtime environment. Within the short time that Fontlab Ltd. had to prepare Fontographer
    4.7, our developers made Fontographer 4.7 run on OS X. However, as our developers
    report, the printing methods used in Fontographer are altogether not up-to-date
    and could not be easily leveraged to produce good printing quality under Mac OS
    X. To make Fontographer print properly, all its printing procedures would need
    to be completely re-written. This would have significantly delayed the release
    of Fontographer 4.7. So unfortunately, it is not an easy thing to fix. As we announced
    several times, Fontlab Ltd. has plans to continue development of Fontographer
    and fully revamp the product. But the goal of version 4.7 was, simply speaking,
    making the \"old FOG\" run under OS X. The current printing quality is an unfortunate
    compromise we had to take. It looks that for reasonable printing, one needs to
    (1) open the .fog in Fontographer 4.1 for Classic and print from there, (2) use
    FogLamp to convert the .fog to .vfb and print from FontLab Studio 5 (even the
    demo version of FontLab Studio 5 should do!), (3) generate the font from Fontographer
    into Type 1 format and print usinng some other methods (e.g. open it in FontLab
    Studio 5 and print from there or install the font on the system and print from
    the application of your choice). I\u2019m sorry this is not entirely the response
    you\u2019d be expecting. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd."
