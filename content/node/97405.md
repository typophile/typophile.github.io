  body: "The capitals look very close to <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/belfast-serial/|Belfast
    Serial Light]]</strong> (or extra light) by SoftMaker but I have no clue about
    the lowercase\r\n"

  body: Thanks. I don't think that's it though as the M and W are wrong. So are the
    numerals. It's very similar to Cochin. Garamond, Goudy etc, but nome of them are
    quite right...

    to be Pabst Roman done for ATF, not digitized.\r\nGoudy later licensed Pabst Oldstyle
