body: I've read in <em>Elements</em> that the dotless i is actually a Turkish character
  and also used with floating accents. Is it fair game to use it as a sort of alternate
  in words like "With" where a tightly kerned Wi may cause problems with the dot?

    i -- just wanted to confirm that I wasn't outside standard practice.\r\n\r\nAnd
    my fi and fl ligatures are always in play...\r\n\r\nThanks, guys (and gals)."

  body: Not sure if word processing or DTP software will be inteligent enough to sort
    and search properly if you use this. If document searching is important to you
    you might want to check.
