  body: "According to [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/people_for_water_for_people.php|Under
    Consideration]], it is a new logo designed by Duffy & Partners.\r\n\r\n\"The typography
    is simple \u2014 I believe it\u2019s a combination of various styles of Chalet
    \u2014 and it could be overlooked easily but the \u201Cw\u201D stands out more
    than it needs with its custom curves and the fact that it is, or at least it looks,
    lighter than the rest of the letters.\""
