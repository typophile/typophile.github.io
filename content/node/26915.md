  name: anonymous
body: ' I am trying to find, or at least identify, certain fonts related to baseball
  teams. The NY Giants and the NY Mets. <BR> <BR>The early Giants used the Victorian,
  or Western, typeface resembling Urwood, or Fanciful in a Mac font, I have seen it
  as an embrodery font called Tiffany...There are scalloped serifs with the inward
  points very pointy &#40;Western and MAD blunts them, cuts the points off&#41;, and
  the indentation on the outside. The fonts mentioned above and the early trypeface
  the Giants used also have/had the points in the middle of the vertical and diagonal
  elements of the typeface&#39;s characters. OK, I have found this style. <BR> <BR>The
  Giants in the 1930s, and the early Mets in the 1960s used this typeface but with
  smooth verticals, the central diamonds, the triangular points are gone....In my
  typeface printing catalogs there are fancy, decorative versions of this, names for
  the typeface are Davison&#39;s Carousel, Baroque....but these fonts or the simpler
  example I can&#39;t find in a computer font. <BR>Does anyone both understand what
  I am asking and know what and where this font may be?  SO far the best I can do
  is to use the Urwood and Saloon as .bmp files and shave those elements off myself...
  <BR> <BR>A related font is the later version; by the 1950&#39;s the Giants were
  using a modernized version of that font...The serifs were now solid trapezoid shape
  the wide part inward; the Mets use this one today for their &#34;NEW YORK&#34;,
  highly outlined and inlined on their jackets.  With stylized central points as well....This
  font I have no clue as to a name, having seen it in no catalog and no font page....anyone
  know of it? <BR> <BR>Lastly would be the large size script style the Mets use in
  their logo. <BR> <BR> <BR>Any help or condilences about these three or so fonts
  I am asking about would be great and finely appreciated. <BR>Paul '
