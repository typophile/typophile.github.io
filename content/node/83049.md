  all would suggest. Diotima and Mrs Eaves are the only ones i have found that i love.
  But i can't afford Mrs Eaves and I'v used Diotima on several past projects. I would
  like to explore a new font of this elegants. Any suggestions? And please, NO script
  fonts. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n- TO  \r\n"
