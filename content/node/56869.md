  ITC Avant Garde... and my instructor and class critique agree it is good but...
  I don't know.  I need help deciding what subtext and body copy to use in the design
  manual.  I decided on Verdana because the organization is an internet forum.  I've
  thought about using Rockwell Light for subheadings, possible for the body in the
  manual.  PLEASE HELPPP... so stuck.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cyan_4618.jpg]\r\n\r\nOh,
  poweredgreen.org is a forum which is supposed to attract technically minded and
  creative individuals with ideas for improving life on this planet with new alternative
  energy sources and other products.   Wants to get government funding to make good
  ideas a reality and spread the technology at little cost if not free to individuals
  around the world who would benefit from it."

  body: This is pretty cool, actually. My only real crit is that the icon feels a
    bit overbearing relative to the wordmark. But AG works well with the icon; if
    you choose a different family, though, you should probably stay within the geometric
    style (Futura, Gotham, Avant-Garde, etc) because of the icon. But AG works. What
    about that choice makes you so uncertain?

  body: the weight is overpowering... i guess there is nothing wrong with the font
    so much as the balance... any ideas for subhead and body that works with AV? ill
    put it in smaller... maybe that feels better[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cyan_4705.jpg]

    blue? or is it vice-a-versa? Anyway...\r\n\r\nOther things: the IO doens't really
    match bigger arcs; type probably too close to symbol; type almost certainly too
    small for this symbol; IO doesn't look centrally positioned (it may be geometrically,
    but it's not visually)\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "Agree with litera and Will...you definitely need to lower the text, leave
    about 1.5 times the size of the text itself in between the symbol and the text.
    Also, as litera said, make the symbol smaller. And nudge until it looks visually
    centered.\r\n\r\nAs for body text, Gill sans will work good. Frutiger will also
    work. If its mostly web, go with the safe choices, Verdana and Georgia :)\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: 'well I made it blue to avoid cliche green for "green organizations" but,
    you got me with the standby symbol.  It is tech oriented but far too late to go
    back on it.  Making the symbol smaller would definitely help with the balance
    but then, I feel uncomfortable with the type being so extended.  It isn''t measure
    centered, when it was it looked off when it was... now it''s not but it looks
    off to you >_<.  I had tried stacking "powered" on "green.org" but was told it
    didn''t make the address flow... perhaps i should just leave out the "org" but
    then, it could get lost with the ".com"- you think?... oh you meant the power
    symbol itself, I could try moving that back to the original place with even spacing
    but people said it made the whole shape oblong...  I''ll try some of your suggestions
    and repost later.   '

- body: "The scale is still way off, IMO. Break out of the tunnel vision and REALLY
    shake up the relationship! In my experience, in order to find something that works,
    you must to completely let go of what doesn't work. In other words: stop forcing
    it. \r\n\r\nIf it were me, I'd search for a font with more weight -- right now,
    it looks like the mark could lose steam, fall, pulverize the type and roll off
    without even noticing. The type actually looks scared of the mark, all clustered
    together and cowering below. They aren't visual peers.\r\n\r\nThe logotype needs
    the most work; as it is now, the kerning needs attention and the tracking is too
    tight. Have you considered capitalization (PoweredGreen.org) or using different
    tones/colors for each word?  With only one ascender and all those round letters,
    \"poweredgreen.org\" is kinda one, long muddy worm."

  body: "I tend to agree with \"litera\" the colors are off. I also agree with \"epsilicon\"
    the power symbol icon is over killed.\r\n\r\nMy opinion: if you develop a symbol,
    similar to what you already have (without the \"power\" icon symbol), reduce its
    size, keep the text in AG, but set it in demi instead (a little heavier), adjust
    the kerning (a little open), and play with 2 different greens. Aqua or teal and
    warm green. So, you have a symbol w/ 2 color greens. For the text (use 2 same
    color greens): Powered (in Aqua/teal; Green (in warm green). \".org\" could be
    med. grey. Then place the new symbol in front of the text (but don't overpower
    it).\r\n\r\nsal\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Another thought: if you set the text \"poweredGreen.org\" in AG demi (all
    in one color green)... you'll notice the \"G\" it has a similar construction as
    the power symbol icon. Then you can repeat the same circles design in a very light
    green and place them behind the \"G\".... it would look like a subliminal power
    symbol icon.\r\n\r\n\r\nsal "

  body: "I don't know if this is what 'having font' meant, but, after considering
    the comments, maybe try rotating the power symbol 90 degrees clockwise so it resembles
    a \"G\" for green. Then you can maybe try to abstract it a little so it has a
    unique treatment.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: I got the power symbol from the Avant Garde "G" literally why I went with
    it.  I've gotten a lot of suggestions and tried this out.  Back to slight gradient.  I
    was already using AG demi btw...  it just wasnt working. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2cyan_6236.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/12cyan_5034.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/11cyan_4981.jpg]....
    I dont think the 2color word works because it splits the singele web address...
    someone suggested myriad pro condensed.
