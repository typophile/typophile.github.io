body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oo_6346.png]\r\n\r\nI'm drawing an uppercase
  C, and I want to cut the curve at 40\xB0. With a perfect circle (yellow) it's easily
  done by rotating the guidelines 40\xB0, but with an ellipsis (blue) I won't get
  the cut straight: The guidelines needs to be nudged up/down just a little. My question
  is: Is there some way to calculate exactly how much?\r\n\r\nForgive my poor terminology.\r\n\r\nf"
