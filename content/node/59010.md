  body: yup, that could be a problem. maybe if you reverse the colors, if you're lucky,
    that might help. this is a completely subjective question, i got with E

    try reversing the colors and it just looks weird. \r\n\r\nWhat I really want to
    know if the overall design is appealing, and if so which version you guys like
    the best."

    I do see: public transport, or maybe construction equipment. \r\nThey have a strong
    heavy duty / industrial feel. Is that intended?\r\nThen again, I'm pretty sure
    such perceptions are culture-specific, \r\nso maybe this doesn't matter at all,
    dunno."

    isn't for anything specific right now.  Certainly if I was trying to appeal to
    a certain demographic I might consider a different style."

  body: "I quite like 'em & I think you chose the right one for your avatar.\r\nHave
    you tried making the horizontal bars of the E equal in length or perhaps cutting
    them diagonally, parallel with the Y)? It kind of bothers me in the bigger versions
    although it works well in the smaller ones... So it probably depends on what you're
    planning to use this for.\r\nAnother problem with the bigger versions could be
    the selected use of rounded corners. I'm not sure they do it justice. They might
    help to take the edge off a bit, but if that's you're intention, I think it needs
    more. Right now, there's too much contrast with the diagonally cuts that way (very
    clearly visible in the Y).  Maybe try intergrating Altaire's interpretation of
    a transport logo & make it more aerodynamic. It might even be nice to see a slanted
    version of this.\r\nI wouldn't use it on a black background by the way, that really
    doesn't work for me.\r\nOverall, nice work that just needs a little finetuning
    depending on your plans for it."
