    you don\u2019t need to include them. Sometimes a smallcap double s is designed
    to replace the \xDF.\r\n\r\nPieter"

    cap versions of \uFB01 (U+FB01) and \uFB02 (U+FB02). They are necessary in the
    font because the text might contain these Unicode ligatures (instead of f+i and
    f+l), and you'd want the glyphs to change to a small cap form when the user applies
    the 'smcp' OT feature.\r\n\r\ngermandbls.sc is a small cap version of \xDF (U+00DF).
    If you don't include this small cap glyph in your fonts, when the user applies
    the 'smcp' OT feature to the word \"stra\xDFe\" he'll be left with a lowercase
    letterform among small caps."

  body: Some applications (only InDesign as far as I know) will make the conversion
    to small caps if you type "fi" or "fl" ligatures directly (shift-opt-5 and shift-opt-6
    on Macs), but other applications (Quark, Illustrator) won't unless you include
    them in your <code>smcp</code> feature.

    cannot be letterspaced.\r\nA better solution would be to 'break' these ligatures
    into their parts in smcp (or maybe even in ccmp and then re-ligate them in liga
    to get a clean character string). But this is theory because one-to-many substitution
    is not supported by AFDKO yet nor in most applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;:("

  body: "The only reason why there's the need for smallcap versions of fi and fl is
    because they are characters, i.e. they have their own Unicode codepoints. In addition,
    these two characters are included in the MacRoman encoding and can be easily accessed
    from the keyboard, so there's a high chance to find them in texts.\r\n\r\nI should
    recall that the current best practice to handle these two glyphs is:\r\n1. Name
    them fi and fl, and assign them the codepoints U+FB01 and U+FB02, respectively;\r\n2.
    Make duplicate glyphs of fi and fl, and name them f_i and f_l (these should NOT
    be assigned any Unicode values as they are ligatures);\r\n3. Make fi.sc and fl.sc
    glyphs (which are smallcap versions of fi and fl, NOT smallcap versions of f_i
    and f_l);\r\n4. Handle fi.sc and fl.sc in 'smcp' and f_i and f_l in 'liga' as
    shown below.\r\n\r\n<code>feature smcp {\r\nsub fi by fi.sc;\r\nsub fl by fl.sc;\r\n}
    smcp;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub f i by f_i;\r\nsub f l by f_l;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    bottom line is, fi/fl are different from f_i/f_l. The first are \"characters\"
    and the latter are \"alternates\".\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "The introduction of ligatures began with the casting of metal type. The \"f\"
    ligatures appeared because in the case of the \"fi\"the overhang of the f would
    bump against the dot on the \"i\" and so on with other letters of the \"f\" combination.
    The french made cliches or what we call glyphs in order to save time in the handsetting
    of type by casting most used combinations together on one piece of type. The use
    of ligatures have become a note of elegance in typography\u2014just like \"smart

  body: In the past, we were not very good at applying this approach to our fonts
    consistently, so you will probably see different results depending on the typeface.
    Some fonts have 'f_i.sc' (that's bad), or perhaps no smallcap version at all (better,
    maybe). Our (Adobe's) policy of preserving codepoints through a "character + feature"
    model continued to evolve after our first OpenType font releases, unfortunately...

    are good -- they're small cap alternates of specific characters. These are \"bad\":\r\n\r\nf_i.sc\r\nf_l.sc\r\ns_s.sc\r\n\r\n...because
    they're not necessary. As was explained earlier, it's best to do the small cap
    substitutions before 'liga'. And, likewise, i_j.sc is an unnecessary alternate
    of a ligature. What you'd maybe want is ij.sc; ij is a legitimate Unicode character,
    like germandbls."
