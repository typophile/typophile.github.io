  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This typeface looks a lot like Caslon. However, the capital T, and the heavier weight of the thin strokes seems to eliminate that possibility (as well as the possibility of a Binney and Robinson Oldstyle or the faces closely derived from that). The T has the flaring of a Caslon, but reduced to about 1/3 the normal value.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon1_6614.jpg]</p>
<p>The type sample is from &ldquo;Memories of a Blue Jacket&rdquo; by Patrick Riley, published in 1928. This first specimen shows some of the italic.</p>
<p>This second sample shows the upper-case J, which definitely is like that of Caslon:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon2_4241.jpg]</p>
<p>And this image, blurry on the right side, unfortunately, shows the capital Q, which is one of the possible shapes for Caslon.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-caslon3_5680.jpg]</p>
<p>This may be so nondescript a typeface as to be difficult to identify, or in such common use that I should not have needed to ask; I cannot tell.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking through some older specimen books, in particular that from the Keystone foundry, has led me to the conclusion that this face does not lie outside the limits of what could have been sold under the name of Caslon Old Style, even though I have not found an exact match yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it&rsquo;s Imprint, a regularized Caslon, with shorter extenders, from Monotype (1913). Quite a good type. Edward Johnston was one of those involved in this revival. The digital versions, as usual, look a bit anemic compared to the letter press print.</p>
<p>There are digital versions both from [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/SearchPage.htm?kid=imprint|Monotype]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/imprint-urw/|from URW]].</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you&rsquo;re right. Looking at the digital version, the specific peculiarities of the Q and the T are exactly matched. And this isn&rsquo;t due to ink spreading (the printing being much too recent for that), but due to the face being digitized at a large size - corresponding to a discussion about Caslon Oldstyle on a Linotype web page involving Gerald Giampa.</p>
<p>I had noticed that this face still had long extenders - at least compared to Caslon 540, but I had missed the fact that they are shorter than those of real Caslon.</p>
<p>I was also going to mention one thing I had forgotten: the book&rsquo;s publisher is Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co. Ltd, and more importantly, it notes that it is &ldquo;Printed in Great Britain by Purnell and Sons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In looking for an ex-copyright book from that printer on Google Books - I couldn&rsquo;t find one - I found that they printed one of the early editions of H. Rider Haggard&rsquo;s She: A History of Adventure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">On 540 and other Caslons. The ATF Caslon 540 was an interpretation of the larger sizes of Caslon, which do have shorter extenders. The different sizes of the originals have different designs, especially the largest sizes. The extenders are shortest at small sizes, then increase up to a heading size of 18 pt (Great Primer), where they are quite generous, and at largest sizes are quite short again. I&rsquo;m not sure at what point above 81 pt they get smaller, as I haven&rsquo;t measured it. I think the Imprint extenders are a bit shorter than Caslon&rsquo;s in the 10-12 pt range.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Incidentally, I found that the Q and the T do match on one form of Caslon Old Style, as well as with Imprint. The illustration of the Caslon Old Style of the Stephenson Blake foundry in &ldquo;Anatomy of a Typeface&rdquo; shows the same Q and T. So this could have been the inspiration for that characteristic of Imprint. (The italic F seen in the book is a non-swash design, which I think confirms that this book is set in Imprint apart from the descender height, though, so I&rsquo;m not holding out Stephenson Blake Caslon Old Style as another possibility.)</div>
