  always been under the impression that when sending files to printer/engraver, it
  was always best to provide the native files, with images sized in Photoshop, placed
  in a document layout program, font files and any cure adjustment files necessary.\r\n\r\nThe
  question has been floating around our office over some business cards. They want
  to send out the files with the type outlined in Illustrator. I was taught this is
  a no no.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: Most font EULAs allow embedding of fonts in PDFs and many, if not most, printers
    nowadays have a PDF workflow. Outlining type in illustrator seems to create a
    bit of thickening, which is particularly noticeable in small sizes.

  body: "Yes, the hinting is lost -- so, particularly on screen, the type looks horribly.
    Fortunately, it's nigh on invisible on the output of a high-resolution machine.
    But try to convince your client of that.\r\n\r\nThe practice of outlining type
    was generally advised because of missing fonts, back in \"the day\" when PDFs
    were not around. Nowadays, proper software should embed all used fonts (or a subset
    thereof) in a PDF. All Adobe programs will do that. And sending a PDF to your
    printer is the recommended way, over sending original files.\r\n\r\nThere are
    a few rare occasions in which you'd really want to outline everything, and these
    guys tend to prefer EPS as well, rather than PDF. (Screen print? Cutters? Maybe
    engravers as well?) They may use old software to drive their rare machines for
    their niche markets, rather than up-to-date PDF rasterizers."
