    I am sorry but just noticed how arrogant the first post seems, it was not meant
    to. <BR> <BR>This font wont be changed because it is finished, and I do not like
    or desire going back to a font I have completed &#40;in my eyes&#41;. I take any
    advice about a completed font and use this to improve future ones. <BR>

    am not going to change it rather than picking the faults with it. <BR> <BR>

    I even see value in critiquing fonts by dead people. <BR> <BR>That said, if there&#39;s
    enough wrong with this font, Graham should consider releasing a replacement later
    on. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I like the font actually, but what Randy Jones said about contructed fonts
    is probably right.  <BR> <BR>With some extra work a new level of elegance &amp;
    life could be coaxed into this font. The feisar font linked to above has some
    of that - but I would like a more humanist application for this font.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Jonathan
    - I think this about your font too.&#41; <BR> <BR>Actually, with the spacing Graham
    has it feels alittle bit Gil Sans-ish to me.

    it up in illustrator from some old work laying about. I am not doing a font like
    this, nor changing it to resemble it either.

  body: Graham, your &#34;This is the type of corrections you wanted, aren&#39;t they?&#34;
    post came off, at least to me, as a pre-emptive attack. It sounds more like you
    don&#39;t really want to hear what we might have to say. <BR> <BR>There may be
    a value in critiquing a dead designer&#39;s work, but the designer himself gains
    no insight by it. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe Mr. Meade will learn anything here.

  body: Excuse me, Mr. Rigby, but I feel that remark is totally uncalled for. I posted
    the second image as it had some of the types of corrections, such as spine of
    S, length of decenders, The 5 and 6 sizes, etc. It was an enquiry to see if this
    the style of the corrections, as well as the proportions that Randy Jones was
    suggesting and not some form of attack. <BR> <BR>With the &#39;helpful assistance&#39;
    you are imparting, it is obvious I will not learn anything. Would you prefer it
    if I didn&#39;t post stuff here, or ask questions ? Would you like me to carry
    on muddling along, teaching myself ?

  body: 'Take it easy, boys. <BR>I think Graham&#39;s tone could be seen as offensive,
    but note that he did start off with &#34;You can rip into the criticism straight
    away&#34;, so I don&#39;t think his point was &#34;please admire my perfect baby&#34;.
    I think he does want to hear what we think of the font. On the other hand, again:
    I hope Graham is open to making a fixed one if he comes to feel that there&#39;s
    enough wrong with it as it stands - otherwise it&#39;s just Art. But font development/release
    is a matter of thresholds, not absolutes: there is always a point beyond which
    it&#39;s really not worth fixing a font. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant, there is a heap wrong with it, and further reflections with the suggestions
    have lead me to believe I should implement these changes. It will still only end
    up my interpretation of the font, and still carrying errors, but it will end up
    the best I could do at this time. <BR> <BR>I am not the best speaker/writer, so
    any assumptions I may be insulting, or rude, will be incorrect. Mr Rigby, While
    you probably felt what you said was right, I feel the remark about living designers
    and critique to be wrong. We do gain insight, well I do. I also believe others
    posting their work here also gain insight from remarks made about the work. Otherwise
    why bother posting ? <BR>

  body: I have changed the characters in regard to the critique given by Randy. The
    K bottom has been slightly more rounded to try to enhance the shape a bit more.
    There are still a few lines that need cleaning up. The change to the S seems to
    give it a slight odd shape. <BR> <BR>Should I lower the Middle bar in the G a
    bit ? It seems a bit high. Or should I shave a bit off the end curve on the top
    of it to open up the gap instead. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28640.gif"

  body: What an impressive typeface &#40;Puckey&#39;s work too&#41;! <BR>I would be
    interested to see how it looks bolder, because the strokes are simply too fine
    for my personal taste... :&#62; <BR>Also I would very much like alternates for
    the &#34;Q&#34;, there could be some very cool options for it, since this font
    is so keen on this &#34;top-rightwardness&#34;!
