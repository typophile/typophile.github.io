  that pic looked like me driving south from Florence.. on the Autostrada..lights
  on or no lights?? found out YES.. on motorways and non-city roads new law... and
  John boy did I miss the Audi S3 and the 1.8T 215BHP... I had a Renault Clio..1.2
  which had lots of trouble getting up the Tuscan hills ... I found a hint.. turn
  off the air conditioning. and a bit confused about how to get it into reverse. but
  all sorted HAD TO HAVE MY GIRLFRIEND SHOW ME!!! there you go Tiff... there is your
  mention for Alphabetty. Woman are good about the details.. she&#39;s a lousy driver....
  believe me. Only odd thing that happened was a friend who is a new driver and comedy
  writer hit my back bumper at the Tuscan villa on the Clio and the plastic thing
  in the bumper fell out and the bumper almost fell off. I had to fix it a bit so
  it looked like it wasn&#39;t hit. I couldn&#39;t tell if he did all the damage or
  some of it was from the no parking sign I knocked over in Florence near the hotel
  doing a U-turn in the street. '

  body: '&#62; turn off the air conditioning <BR> <BR>Yeah, in smaller cars it feels
    like you&#39;re doubling the horse power! Last summer in Halkidiki&#42; I was
    trying to find this little monastery on a hill in the middle of nowhere, dirt
    trails and all, in a little Hyundai. The first day we were four adults and a kid,
    and we couldn&#39;t find it, but we did get over a pretty steep uphill with some
    proper clutch work. The next day we tried again with three adults and a kid &#40;my
    dad refused to come along that time&#41;, but when we got to the strong uphill
    part the car refused to go. Thinking &#34;this can&#39;t be right&#34;, I tried
    a hunch and turned off the AC, and there it went! It turned out we had the AC
    off the previous time. There really is something pretty sick about AC, if you
    ask me - at least in a car. <BR> <BR>&#42; After the Thessaloniki conference,
    which is happening again next year, and I recommend both the conference and the
    tourism there very highly. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Tiffany, men and women are good at different things. There&#39;s nothing
    wrong with accepting that, as long as you don&#39;t use it unfairly. Generally,
    it&#39;s good to know the truth. <BR> <BR>And the difference isn&#39;t just anecdotal:
    the &#34;wiring&#34; between the brain&#39;s two hemispheres is different in men
    and women. I don&#39;t pretend to know what that implies &#40;and I think few
    scientists have even tried to get any grasp of it either, yet - maybe due to the
    social phobia that Vincent described elsewhere&#41;, except for this simple and
    safe conclusion: there is a difference. And by god does that make me happy - homogeneity
    is death. <BR> <BR>I honestly don&#39;t know about driving &#40;I think it&#39;s
    mostly a cultural thing - like there are only two female tow truck drivers in
    the entire state of California, and such a low proportion can&#39;t be due [mostly]
    to physiology&#41;, but for example women do make better astronauts, apparently.
    Sadly, such distinctions are often ignored by people in power who are psychologically
    weak: <BR> <BR><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3042836.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3042836.stm</a>
    <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t shoot for &#34;as good as&#34; - relish the diversity, and
    conquer your own glorious mountains. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>You know what&#39;s
    really funny? Much faster that the &#34;mother&#34; thread &#40;pardon the pun&#41;,
    this thread went from being about cars to being about women... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    I added the wink to let Vince know that I was teasing him.

    the Pepsi Max, not so much the Robbie Williams. ;^&#41;

    Knebworth and it was on TV. Unfortunately Kylie didn&#39;t sing with him.  <BR>
    <BR>Robbie did have some fit dancing girls for the boys, as he said. I think the
    men there were all dragged there since it was full of singing girls.. my friend
    from Manchester went.. she&#39;s a screaming girl too. '
