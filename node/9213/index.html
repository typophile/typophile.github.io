  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello. I'm doing a report on how technology and the digitalization of the publishing industry has affected the quality (typographic and otherwise) of published work. I noticed that quite a few people here are typographers and book designers, and that some have been in the industry since the days of the Linotype and Monotype machines (Gerald Giampa and Jim Rimmer?). I was wondering if I could get someone else's opinion on this topic, as many of you are most likely much more knowledgable about the issue than I. <BR> <BR>Currently, I'm leaning towards the opinion that the reduced learning curve and investment involved in using today's technology compared to technology before the digital era has led to a lower overall standard of quality. Of course, the issue is more complicated than that (I seem to remember Gerald Giampa once saying that bad type can be set using any technology), but it's a start. <BR> <BR>Can anyone help, share their opinion, or point me to any relevant books or articles? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Andrew</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The cheapness of today's tools means that it is both much easier to produce top-quality work as well as much easier to turn out crap. <BR> <BR>Going digital is a minor issue in the overall story of publishing quality. The big question is one of economics: will publishers invest a little more time and money into quality, or will they heed the imperative of cost minimization as a way to maximize profits? <BR> <BR>It used to be that you <i>had</i> to invest some serious labor to get a book typeset, no choice. These days, you can run off the Microsoft Word manuscript on a high quality laser printer, and get results that many people would not be easily able to distinguish from quality typesetting. <BR> <BR>I'm also not sure how much sense it makes to talk of an overall standard of quality. There's always a range. I savor the experience of encountering fine book from a hundred or more years ago, but a lot of books from back then were no better typographically than run-of-the-mill books today.</div>

I've produced some OpenType CE versions of some of my fonts, but haven't got around to releasing them on the general market. I think the OpenType format will drive this, but it's early days yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, something Nick and I actually agree on, more or less. <BR> <BR>Charles, the very latest versions of Minion Pro and Myriad Pro do indeed have Vietnamese support. This was added last year. <BR> <BR>Although many, many languages can each be done with &quot;a few extra glyphs,&quot; all those extra glyphs do add up to quite a bit of work. Especially if one is going to consider kerning, and small cap versions, and so on. <BR> <BR>If one is a stickler for design quality, any of the diacritics which actually attaches to a character is yet more work, because additional optical adjustments must be made. You can't just remove overlap and get a nice result. The ogonek and the Vietnamese hook are both good examples of this. <BR> <BR>The typeface I'm working on right now would be a lot closer to done if I hadn't kept on saying things like &quot;I'll just throw in Vietnamese, too&quot; (or the extra Latin for the delta between CE and WGL4, or whatever). &quot;It won't be that much more work.&quot; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

I really don't believe that there is a market for any of my typefaces for setting Vietnamese or Persian (Why isn't that, like, Iran?). <BR>Everything to do with an independent foundry is incremental, not very significant considered in isolation, but one has to prioritize. Everything is competing for attention, including yakking on Typophile (except when it's down). <BR> <BR>One of my next hurdles is getting out OT versions of my back catalogue, possibly with CE encoding. I'd prefer to add the typographic extras rather than extra language encoding. It's a real dilemma of what to do, for a small foundry: new fonts get the marketing exposure, but all the old ones need to be updated to CE and OT. And I don't consider myself to be overly &quot;Anglo-centric&quot;, after all, I am an Anglo. However, I do find many of the CE diacritics fascinating: did you know that the slash on the l-slash goes at the top of the ascender in scripts? <BR> <BR>I think every foundry should have one face that is a multi-lingual workhorse. Maybe two, a sans and a sans serif. I'm working on one at the moment, but my loyalty is divided, I'm also spending time on developing fonts which utilize contextual alternates &ndash; the aesthetic imperative of OpenType, rather than the linguistic one.</div>
