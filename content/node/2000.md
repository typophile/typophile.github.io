body: Hi, <BR> <BR>When I have my scetches ready to be put into Fontographer, how
  do I best calculate the metrics &#40;descender, ascender room&#41;? <BR>Normally
  the &#34;interlining&#34; &#40;space between the descenders and ascenders of the
  next line&#41; is set to 10/12. I would like to calculate the room between the lines
  and wonder if there is a default rule to follow here.  <BR>I know it also depends
  on the wishes of the designer, but is there something like a golden rule? How to
  calculate the metrics so that they reference 10/12? <BR> <BR>I hope this makes any
  sence. My english has some major holes in this technical area. <BR> <BR>Any tips?
  <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren

    <BR> <BR>Hmm, don&#39;t think of type in milimeters, or inches. <BR>Think about
    &#39;units&#39;. Usually, Postscript fonts  <BR>have a total height of 1000 units.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; How much room do I leave in between the lines so <BR>&#62; that
    it looks and feels good?  <BR> <BR>It depends on a lot of things: body size,  <BR>line-length,
    language, aesthetic preferences, etc. <BR>That&#39;s why the leading &#40;the
    &#39;room between the  <BR>lines&#39;&#41; is defined by the graphic designer,
    the  <BR>person using your typeface. <BR> <BR>Edit: there&#39;s a small amount
    of leading that  <BR>should be defined by the type designer &#40;see  <BR>below&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s impossible to achieve a 10/12 leaded font.  <BR>You can&#39;t
    change leading on Fontographer. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest you this.
    You have: <BR>Descender &#40;2x&#41; &#43; xHeight &#40;6x&#41; &#43; Ascender
    &#40;3x&#41; = Total &#40;11x&#41; <BR> <BR>Change &#39;x&#39; for 70 units. You&#39;ll
    have: <BR>Descender &#40;140&#41; &#43; xHeight &#40;420&#41; &#43; Ascender &#40;210&#41;
    = Total &#40;770&#41; <BR> <BR>Considering this is a Postscript Type-1 font,  <BR>you&#39;ll
    still have a &#39;residual leading&#39;, 230 units. <BR>Try this in Fontographer,
    and compare the result <BR>to an existing font. This is hard to explain <BR>through
    words... :-|'

  body: Rene, I guess you mean the &#34;internal leading&#34; &#40;also called &#34;talus&#34;&#41;,
    the empty space below the descenders plus above the ascenders? For the former,
    usually it&#39;s about 10% &#40;20% is too much&#41;, although it does vary depending
    on intended usage and x-height size. <BR> <BR>&#62; don&#39;t think of type in
    milimeters, or inches. <BR> <BR>True - unless you&#39;re designing for an exact
    size!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Using Eduardo&#39;s method, I&#39;d use 80-85 instead
    of 70. <BR>Also, you should put most of the talus above the ascender height &#40;for
    cap accents&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: hhp, I take it you mean 10% of the body height?  <BR> <BR>But that&#39;s what
    I&#39;m looking for, the internal leading. Now I know how to call that space;
    talus. Funny word... <BR> <BR>Sorry about my bad technical English. I never studies
    type design. Everything I know I know from learning by doing and over the internet.
    I would like to get some more knowledge on the technical background of type design
    and get some more tricks on how to make a type more consistent. Now I&#39;m working
    like a monk to get my types in balance. I&#39;m a perfectionist, therefor it works.
    But some background information, that you might get in the first lesson of type
    design, I might not know.  <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren

    &#34;Internal leading&#34; is more common, but it&#39;s still rare. Some people
    call it &#34;shoulder&#34;, alluding to metal type, but I think that&#39;s misleading
    because the shoulder and the neck&#42;&#42; combined made up the talus. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    I got it from Javal, but have seen it only one other place. I like it because
    it&#39;s short and sounds nice. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;  The inclined part going up

    a large amount of work from analogue artwork, but almost everyone I know now designs
    directly on computer. If they make drawings on paper, they are more likely to
    scan these and use ScanFont to create initial outlines, or to do what I do: prop
    up the drawing beside the computer screen and &#39;eye-ball&#39; it in FontLab.'

  body: Eduardo <BR> <BR>I have heard that Ikarus is being used less and less, but
    I am not really on an inside track regarding computers, so I don&#39;t know how
    popular it is. I would guess not very widespread. It is the first thing that I
    came across when Gerald Giampa started his font company here in the Vancouver
    area in the mid eighties. <BR> <BR>I like it that Ikarus is attuned to working
    right on top of your drawings rather than on scans. I realize that it is old technology,
    but I&#39;ve gotten very comfortable with it, and once you get on to what it can
    do, it&#39;s FAST! <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I had a student from an art college
    come here to my workshop, and he wanted to learn Fontographer which I also use,
    and he like it a lot, since he was working from scans of Victor Hammer&#39;s American
    Uncial. Once he had done all the outlines, I taught him the process and he cut
    it in 14 point metal. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to take a shot at Fontlab. I saw it
    used here at the ATypI bash, and thought it looked very refined, although for
    me Ikarus would be quicker and with so much manual control. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: Although it is mighty interesting to discuss over and over the advantages
    of this program for font production over that program, the most interesting thing
    at the end is what you want to achieve. I assume that for type designers the main
    goal is to convert the idea into perfect contour descriptions. The font producer
    wants to have the most solid conversion of the outline data into the current font
    formats. The end user is normally only interested in the quality of the design
    and he wants to be sure that the fonts function fine technically. Which program&#40;s&#41;
    were used for the font production is not important at all for the end user. Also,
    in time the only thing that will last is the design itself. Beside some technicians
    and historians, in the future nobody will be interested in the current technology
    used for the creation of the type. If the design is good, it will last and otherwise
    it will be forgotten no matter how interesting we now consider the way the technology
    was used. And then for the font producer there is the long term technology, the
    digital contour description, and short term technology that preserves the best
    conversion to limited apparatus, like delta hints. On the &#40;relatively&#41;
    long term only the contours will be the constant factor and the short term technology
    will change constantly. <BR> <BR>So, the type designer will use the program that
    fits his purposes best to create the outlines. This can be done in Illustrator,
    Fontographer, FontLab, BezierMaster, IkarusMaster, etc. The method used depends
    on the basic material. If there is analog material, the decision on which method
    is the best for conversion into digital outlines will be based on the quality
    of the drawings. For sketches normally the use of an auto tracing program is most
    likely but for high quality working drawings Ikarus is the most appropriate application.
    It makes no sense to scan a perfect contour, subsequently to auto trace this and
    then to end up with reworking the contours again. This is a waist of time and
    probably also of quality.  <BR>The fact that the Ikarus algorithms are more than
    25 years old does not mean it is old technology. It would be archaic in case there
    was a better alternative for converting working drawings into digital contours
    but there is none. For this reason the next generation of IkarusMaster will support
    the Wacom CAD tablets. <BR> <BR>If it is true that most designers don&#39;t make
    working drawings anymore, then this worries me somewhat. The design itself should
    determine the most preferable production. Almost for all DTL typefaces we start&#40;ed&#41;
    with drawings which are manually digitized. Revivals like DTL Fleischmann, DTL
    Fell and DTL VandenKeere were completely made on paper and afterwards manually
    digitized to preserve as much detail as possible. The basic sets of DTL Romulus
    were also digitized in Ikarus. Again, the technology is only a means to help the
    type designer to convert his ideas. In our case DTL FontMaster fits our purposes,
    of course, but it is fully understandable that other designers/font producers
    stick to FontLab or any other &#40;combination of&#41; programs.  <BR> <BR>Concerning
    the internal leading in the em square I would like to add that first of all you
    should make use as much as possible of the resolution. By reserving a large part
    of the em for the leading there could be a lost of accuracy because you end up
    with less resolution for the contours themselves. Besides this, normally the lengths
    of the descenders will change in case of the bolder versions of a type face. Because
    of the increasing x-height of the bolder versions the relation between the lenght
    of the ascenders and the descenders will change and it is quite common to make
    the descenders somewhat shorter. <BR>

    the neck plus the shoulder equals the ankle bone. Good one. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>
    <BR>On a historical note &#40;you all knew I had one, right&#41;, typefaces designed
    for production as Linotype matrices were required, for mechanical reasons, to
    leave a small amount of space at the top and bottom of the design. &#40;For sizes
    5 and 6 pt, this was .002&#34;; for 7 to 12 pt, .003&#34;; 14 pt, .004&#34;; and
    16 to 24, .005&#34;.&#41;  <BR> <BR>So, for example, a 12-point design, with a
    slug of 0.166&#34;, could only be 0.160&#34; tall. Translated to Postscript units
    &#40;1000 unit em&#41;, this is equivalent to 964 units on the body. This was
    a maximum; the designer could, if he wanted, make the face smaller. <BR> <BR>The
    proportions of ascenders and descenders were dictated by a standard line placement
    for every size. On occasion, there were ways of working around these. <BR> <BR>I
    spent some time at one point examining a number of current Postscript fonts and
    observing various proportions. The size of designs, from top of ascender to bottom
    of descender, varies widely -- from designs like PMN Caecilia, MT Albertina, or
    Iowan Old Style which extend beyond the em square by a couple units to smallish
    designs like MT Fournier, MT Ehrhardt, or MT Walbaum which come in around 850
    - 900 units or so. The average over 40 designs that I looked at was around 960
    units -- on par with the Linotype 12-pt standard. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'
