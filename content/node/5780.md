body: i&#39;m looking for some good block-type fonts, such as the one used in the
  <a href="http://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/~cris/pix/2898/spaceneedle-starbucks-067.3.jpeg">Starbucks</a>
  logo. <BR> <BR>and also, the font used on the new Fall Out Boy CD, <a href="http://www.interpunk.com/itemimages2/23899.jpg">Take
  This To Your Grave</a>, is pretty close also. <BR> <BR>any help you guys could give
  me on those two, or any good block kinda fonts &#40;preferably free!&#41; would
  be awesome.

  body: I dont know exactly what you are looking for but anyway I think the knockout
    series are really versatile. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/series_a.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/series_a.html</a> <BR>
    <BR>You could also try some of the Font Bureau sans, like Bureau Grotesque, Rhode,
    Nobel, Berlin Sans and the famous Eagle.

    <BR> <BR>I was under the impression that Starbucks <BR>was set in Franklin Gothic,
    but I haven&#39;t <BR>confirmed it. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Futura Extra Bold, Gill Sans Extra Bold, Avenir Black, TheSans black, Today
    Ultra are all good choices. I am too lazy to provide links for all of them.

  body: I always thought <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-stone-sans-2/stone-sans-itc-bold/testdrive.html?s=STARBUCKS%2BCOFFEE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> ITC Stone Sans Bold</a> was a better approximation of the Starbucks
    Logo font &#40;which I think is a custom font&#41;. The other suggestions are
    fine for the CD lettering, because it&#39;s a different font.
