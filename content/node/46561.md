  the Arabic words 'halal' and 'haraam'. I do not speak or write the language, but
  appreciate the beauty of the script. Unfortunately I cannot seem find to any examples
  of these words written by hand on the internet, and I would much rather use a hand-written
  type specimen rather than a digitally typeset one because I feel it conveys the
  beauty and fluidity of the language far better.\r\n\r\nI was hoping someone could
  point me in the right direction of some specimens, or even if someone knew Arabic
  themselves it would be amazingly generous if they could provide a basic specimen
  and be showered in thanks for the rest of eternity?\r\n\r\nHuge thanks,\r\n\r\nRafe"

  body: "I don't really know much about Arabic calligraphy, but which (if any) would
    be the correct form of the word \"\u1E25al\u0101l\"? I am guessing, the difference
    is that one of the examples is written left-to-right.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arabic_3601.jpg]\r\n___________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "Top appears to read <em>haram</em> -- and yes, that's right to left!\r\n\r\nI
    just looked up the characters in the Windows Character map :-) I can clearly identify
    the Initial Hah; the Medial Reh is a bit more curved in Times New Roman. Next
    one -- the 3rd from the <em>right</em>, that is -- seems to be an alef, ending
    with a Final form Meem.\r\n\r\nThen again, I wouldn't take Times New Roman as
    the norm. There is a dedicated [[http://www.typophile.com/forum/366|Arabic Typesetting
    forum]] elsewhere on this site. Perhaps better moved over there."
