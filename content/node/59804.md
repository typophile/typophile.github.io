    I look at the form, I see CENPARMI in the header. A little google search leads
    <a href=\"http://www.cenparmi.concordia.ca/\">here</a> where CENPARMI means \"Center
    for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence\"  (and in the list of M.Sc.
    students, there is someone called Shima Nikfal). "

  body: "I agree that they won't go away, but why? Any reasonably intelligent person
    should be able to figure out that this survey is completely useless. Its basic
    idea is flawed. It's incomplete at minimum. The person who designed it obviously
    spends more time with computers than people. \r\nAny findings will be worse than
    useless. So, what is the point?\r\n\r\nOf course this comment is also useless.

  body: Controlling your population of participants (Ss) <em>might</em> increase statistical
    power. However, this would require demographic data collection which raises issues
    of anonymity.

    perhaps someone should create an online survey looking into the personality traits
