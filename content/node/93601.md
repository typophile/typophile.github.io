  Author\" from Sterling Hayden's \"The Wanderer\" book published by Knopf in 1963.\r\n\r\nIt
  looks to have been done by a Linotype machine from the justification, but not sure
  what typeface it is exactly. \r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3677.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3754.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6427.jpg]"

  body: "You have a couple of different things going on here. The first sample is,
    most likely, from the original 1963 edition and looks closest to Linotype\u2019s
    Antique No. 1, which included oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nThe contents is, obviously,
    from later: the listings may still be Antique No. 1, but the heading and the type
    on the cover appear to be Times Roman, New or otherwise."

  body: Actually, I think the text is not Antique No. 1, but Primer. The only digital
    version I know of is Bitstream's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/">Century
    751</a>, which appears to be based on a larger cut and lacks small caps and old
    style figures, unfortunately.

  body: "Mark,\r\n\r\nPrimer isn\u2019t in my undated 1,200+ page Linotype Faces catalog\u2014whenever
    it was published, two small cans of Dunker\u2019s Wax Beans cost 13\xA2. Was Primer
    an earlier release that was discontinued, or a later release than this catalog
    (I\u2019m guessing 1950s)?"

  body: Linotype released it in 1953 as an improvement over Century Schoolbook. More
    info in the McGrew book (p. 258). I couldn't find it in the Lino books I have,
    but I only have a few.
