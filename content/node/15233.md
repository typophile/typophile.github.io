  body: "From what I understood from ITC - they no longer have the rights to make
    or sell it. There seems to be a legal hassle behind it, one they wouldn't tell
    me about.\r\n\r\nIn the past both Image Club Graphics and Bitstream had digitized
    and sold it, but sorry, ICG is long gone and Bitstream no longer sells it.\r\n\r\nThere
    use to be a copy for the taking online - but even that has been removed.\r\n\r\nThis
    would be a wonderful time for a 1/1 since neither wdpartnerdesign nor gilles have
    email/website or send messages....\r\n\r\nIf you need something typeset - just
    ask."
