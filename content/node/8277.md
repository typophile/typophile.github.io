  body: 'Spreads normally have their own pastboards in InDesign. But somehow you&#39;ve
    changed the default vertical spacing. <BR> <BR>To get it back to the default,
    go to InDesign&#62;Preferences&#62;Guides &amp; Pasteboard... . At the bottom
    of the window, there is an option called &#34;Pasteboard Options: Minimum Vertical
    Offset&#34;. Setting the value to 6p0 will give you the default setting.'

  body: Why is my print quality so much better from Pagemaker than from Indesign?
    I am using OSX and a HP laser printer.
