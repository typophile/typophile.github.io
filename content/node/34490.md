  body: "Thanks! Spread the word, if you please. I will be adding material and links
    every night this week.\r\n\r\nI feel the way to really get this mark to endure
    is to make it as easy on everyone, from the laymen to the pros, to have it. Of
    course, full page ads are nice, too, but I'm not springing for them. Also, I don't
    think it should feel like it is coming from the top down.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A report from a lively Finnish forum, where there are several subjects on
    the go any given time. The irony mark didn't excite them half as much as I expected,
    response was somewhat cool or sarcastic (sic!)\r\n\r\nHere's some samples loosely
    translated:\r\n\r\nA: \" Can't see any use for it, the current smileys haven't
    reduced misunderstandings in the internet discussions ;)\"\r\n\r\nB: \"Of course
    it should be used, I've been told there's plenty of sarcasm in the internet. Attatched
    to the sign there should be an explanation of its meaning and whether it's there
    for sarcasm or irony + good reasons for choosing the mentioned style. After all,
    the limitations of the traditional glyphs are infuriatingly limited.\r\n\r\nStrongly
    in context, whatever happened to the Swatch internet time?\"\r\n\r\nC (to B):
    What about the cultural differences? The American word for sarcasm has a bit more
    sarcastic meaning than the Finnish one, how should that be marked?\r\n.~ (us)
    \r\n.~ (fi) \r\n\r\n\r\n.~ (:p)\"\r\n\r\nD: \"A brilliant idea .~\"\r\n\r\nE:

  body: "The most logical thing I can imagine is that if the snark follows Finnish
    words, it portrays whatever tone of irony would be most natural to that language.
    Most of the classic English punctuation seems to have come about as intonation
    marks first, so I have been pursuing that approach in explaining \"the right time\"
    for using the snark: If the irony is \"silent\" the mark is not needed, but where
    one uses a dry monotone, a sneer, mock-officiousness, extended vowels or other
    audible devices to make it clear, the snark is the text proxy. Since I only speak
    English well enough to mention, I am making a lot of assumptions with this premise.
    Perhaps, there are different, but analogous cues in other languages.\r\n\r\nThe
    failure of Swatch Internet Time is interesting to consider, in context. I am suspect
    that not only was Swatch time not a useful-enough technology, when compared to
    existing solutions, such as UTC, but that people don't a \"brand\" of time, and
    the connotations that it implies. I am a devotee to the snark, but it is an amalgam
    of many people's ideas, and not owned or branded.\r\n\r\nD -E: I think that those
    comments are an inevitable side affect of public written discussion of a mark
    that can be used for sarcasm (amongst other things). I like to consider the posters
    \"early adopters\"."

  body: "The primary reason why I don't anticipate the snark catching on is that sarcasm
    (in it's many lovely hues*) is something that only a small part of the world's
    population engage in regularly. I have read that it's strongest use is in the
    UK & Ireland for some reason. The only demographic that correlates with that oddly
    enough is a similarly higher rate of Schidzophrenia. Now I am not saying that
    the snark or sarcasm cause Schidzophrenia... But I am saying that for a mark to
    really catch on it has to be cool so that people go out of their way to use it
    - in which case you had better get on facebook or whatever is the trendy thing
    just now, or it has to be seen as really useful to not everybody; but a big enough
    group that the others cave in or become innured to the new thing. Another idea
    would be to focus on the UK & or Ireland. They are likelier to find a 'need' for
    it - and then maybe it will go on from there.\r\n\r\n* I mean that! "

  body: "\"...is something that only a small part of the world\u2019s population engage
    in regularly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have yet to find a good resource on global views
    on sarcasm. My anecdotal evidence suggests that figurative language that functions
    like verbal irony, is not a novel concept to English-as-a-second language speakers
    from a broad number of countries. Having formerly lived ion the California coast,
    my daily activities crossed paths with a much broader mix of national, educational
    and social class origins of non-native English speakers. Those with the most rudimentary
    English skills seem to readily understand intoned sarcasm or hyperbole instantly,
    often with more facility than the actual words. Sarcasm appeared to be used effortlessly
    and sometimes heavily by Russians, Indians, Pakistani, Czechs  Latinos and others
    of moderate to medium mastery. This suggests to me that the art of meaning one
    thing with the words, and another with the way they are said, is a very pandemic
    habit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I understand the weakness of personal impressions,
    and would like to hear from anyone with figures and facts. For the most part,
    I offer little opinion on if it is appropriate or even sensible for other languages.
    I just know that it keeps getting brought up in English, and makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nEvidently
    Ethiopia has an established parallel mark already, and France occasionally flirts
    with one. Are the French more sarcastic than the British? And Ethiopians the zen
    masters of the witticism?\r\n\r\nI do not even know if a portion of the US is
    more sarcastic than another, or if anyone has even explored that previously. The
    cultural mores in my current home discourage progressive behavior and uncivil
    personal expression. This affects many things and it is likely we will never be
    known as the home of the snark. But is it the same culture in Boston? Compton?
    London? Perhaps a bloke out of Dublin will call tomorrow and pledge a million
    to fund snark awareness, but then - there might be an kid in Milan spraypainting
    snarks on security cameras today. Till then, just keep playing with it when brainstorming
    typefaces, if you like. If anything interesting develops, I will blog it you-know-where."

    Even though The impression I have is as I have written above - this is just an
    impression. What we need is a linguist/anthropologist to sort us out.\r\n\r\nEven
    though I am a sort of doubter - I am fond of sarcasm in it's many forms/dilutions.
    And therefore fond of the snark if merely for association with sarcasm."
