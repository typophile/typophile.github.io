  body: GetInfo will change one file but "change all" reverts the default application
    back to Font Book. Default App has FontLab Studio as the associated application,
    though that's no help. Even if I delete Font Book altogether, the system wants
    to use either FontThing or Lemkesoft's FontBook. "Change all" and "always open
    with" don't seem to override the new association for FFIL files.

  body: "I'm using FontExplorer X in 10.4.6 (not upgraded to 10.4.7) but there, you
    set the preferences WITHIN FontExplorer, under Advanced. There's a box you can

    might want to see if FontLab has a similar option."

  body: I wonder of "get info" and choosing the always used app would make a difference.
    I had this problem with EPS files and fixed it. I'll try and remember what I did.
