  (like macron marks). These signify long vowel sounds and are used in the Hepbern
  romanisation of Japanese Language called Romaji.\r\n\r\nLooking at a  Japanese \"Pro\"
  Font:\r\nUnicodes seem to match glyphs for tilde diacritic characters\r\ncid reference
  codes do not seem to work?\r\n\r\nIs there any way to make Romaji work in a font
  without doing a special function OT feature?"

    for upper and lowercase macroned vowels at CIDs 9361 through 9370, and they're
    encoded at U+0100/U+0101 (\u0100\u0101), U+0112/U+0113 (\u0112\u0113), U+012A/U+012B
    (\u012A\u012B), U+014C/U+014D (\u014C\u014D), and U+016A/U+016B (\u016A\u016B).
    You don't need any special OpenType feature to access these glyphs. You simply
    need to use the appropriate Unicode code points."
