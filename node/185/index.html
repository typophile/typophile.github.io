<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, <br> <br>here's another logo I've been working and will present it to the client next week. This is tricky one. The name of the company is called GRUPO REPOLHO. It's the portuguese name for "cabbage group" where repolho is the family name of the owners. The company is a big group of transportation, construction, machine rental and landscape/nature recovery related. <br> <br>On my first ideas I realized the logo needed a "motion" look like a wheel (machine rental also added this wheel idea). Now the name REPOLHO (cabbage) was also a starting point, altough it's a kind of strange name for a company like this. <br> <br>So the task was to do a cabbage brand that has some motion and that looks cool. I came out with a logo that I personally like a lot, and I'm showing it here for your advises on the type/font i should use along it. <br> <br> <br>1. Here's a photo of a repolho <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10990.jpg alt> <br> <br>2. Here's what I got after several sketches. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10991.gif alt> <br> <br>3. A preview on the cards, I'm thinking on having the logo "embossed" on the papper, so the back of the card has the brand on papper with the negative emboss simmulated by the tint color... <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10992.gif alt> <br> <br>The font I used is Adobe Myriad Pro which falls under the "Overused fonts". Anyone has a suggestion on a typeface that match the mood of the brand/icon? Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>very good adriano <br> <br>i find the sinthesis of the repolho is great(and kinf of machinery), but i would be carefull with the blank spaces on the perimeter leaves, y think is too thin and at small sizes specially embossed it wont have the definition that requires. <br> <br>well done <br>CG</div>

<div class=commentbody>very nice Adriano!!:-) <br> <br>as I can imagine this being used on everything from business cards to large trucks or billboards, you may have to create different versions for use at different sizes and for different printing methods which is okay IMHO.

<div class=commentbody>Hi again. Jean P., could you please write the words repolho on your Le Monde font so that I could see the result? No need for a big quality gif, just for visual reference. Those fonts are not on any testdrive I know and so it's difficult to see how they will work out. Thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>The company is a big group of transportation, construction, machine rental and landscape/nature recovery related.</i> <br> <br>Unless the client really wants to stress the latter aspects of their business, your logo might be a bit too organic looking. Perhaps you could try the same shape only more regularised? Or, perhaps you could provide two versions of the same form, for use by different businesses within the Grupo Repolho: so they could have a more mechanical looking version for their transport and machine rental and a more organic version for use with their more environmental businesses.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nuts are hexagonal, but plants and other natural formations most often display symmetry based on integers in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... this is the reason so many flowers have five or eight petals. It also applies to artichokes, pineapples, and general branching rules in plants. <br> <br>I also think the cabbage logo is fine as it is. In fact, I'd say it's brilliant. <br> <br>I would also go with a serif font instead (but I must confess I generally dislike any sans.) Perhaps you should consider a family with an incised weight to harmonize with the "incised" highlights on the outer cabbage leaves. Either way, something more organic-looking. <br> <br>Perhaps something by <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/product.asp?nCo=AFMT&st=keyword&sk=kobayashi">Akira Kobayashi</a> would do. Or <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&sku=ITC9118">Highlander</a> or <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&sku=ITC9104">Kallos</a>. For some reason I'm too lazy to look beyond recent ITC stuff right now, but those are solid designs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's a nice idea, Tiffany, but I think the addition of italic type adds a "third dynamic" - I'm not sure how else to describe it - that weakens the design overall. <br> <br>Even having Grupo and Repolho in different colours threatens to do this, but the larger Repolho in green helps balance the design. <br> <br>Adriano's original design at the top seems to have the most poise (type choices aside). It reminds me a lot of the BP logo. The business cards are perfect, too, with the olive colour keeping the emphasis on the logo. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes. It isn't crisp and sharp enough, at least not to match the mark. <br> <br>Looking at it again Adriano. The mark has such strong possibilities.

<div class=commentbody>Hello Adriano, <br> <br>First of all I would like to say I like the logo. <br>But second I have to say I agree with John Hudson. The logo works for me too much as 'healthy', 'reform', 'nature', etc. <br>You can use the gag of designing the logo for a mechanical company like that in a very 'nature shop'-kind of way. But if you do that, the typography is very important. <br>You have to remember that it is a mechanical company. Maybe a straight forward kind of typo is better. Helvetica sounds good to me. <br> <br>Perhaps changing the colour is a help. You could do that for the differtent specialities within the company, thereby creating sub-logos. At least you take the edge of the 'nature-look'. <br> <br>Regards, <br>Ren</div>
