    on?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, note that there is a diagonal from the upper left corner
    to the lower right corner of the page.\r\n\r\nThen, a line going from the upper
    right corner crosses that main diagonal <em>at a 90 degree angle</em> to indicate
    that point.\r\n\r\nThat means that that point marks where you could draw a horizontal
    line to create a rectangle, made from the top of the page above the line, which
    has the same proportions as the page as a whole - because its diagonal makes the
    same angle, except rotated by 90 degrees, as the diagonal of the whole page.\r\n\r\nThis
    rectangle is then the basis on which the three horizontal lines you do see drawn
    are constructed.\r\n\r\nFirst, the point where the rotated shrunk page diagonal
    crosses the main diagonal defines the bottom-most of those three lines.\r\n\r\nThen,
    a diagonal is made for the left half of the rotated page image, and where that
    crosses the main diagonal defines the second line.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bottom-most
    of the three lines is used to define a new thinner rectangle; where its diagonal
    crosses the main diagonal indicates where the top line is to be drawn.\r\n\r\nAh:
    <em>this</em> might help:\r\n\r\n[[http://ministryoftype.co.uk/words/article/constructing_the_grid/]]"

  body: "One isn't necessary for the purpose of constructing the lines.\r\n\r\nIt
    should be noted, though, that you are right in being suspicious of this construction.
    It doesn't really embody some fundamental aesthetic principles. If the aspect
    ratio of the page were different, following the same steps would create a radically
    different, and thus presumably not necessarily attractive, layout. (And I presume
    that the existing aspect ratio is not exactly the golden ratio, even if it approximates
    it.)\r\n\r\nSo it is just that starting from the page as it is, following these
    particular steps happens to put the horizontal divisions in places that could
    have easily just been specified as numerical fractions of the page height."

    I've included some examples above, based on grids derived from root rectangles."
