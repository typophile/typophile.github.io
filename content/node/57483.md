    but I can't see enough letters at TypOasis. It may also be at Dafont.This is a
    revival of an old Art Nouveau-era design, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Scriptorium's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/blackthorn/|Blackthorn]]
    is quite similar, but not identical. David Nalle's description of its influences
    mentions circus and old west styles, as well as Art Nouveau and Alfonse Mucha,
    so who knows what other fonts may have had similar inspirations.\r\n\r\n- Mike
