  somewhere in the late 1990's or early 2000's, but I am quite sure I have seen this
  \"specific\" version as far back as at least the 1970's.\r\n\r\nThis clearly falls
  in the Blackletter Category, but does anyone know the font name and foundary that
  matches exactly this letter set?"

      for posting it to see if any typofile experts could identify this precise sample.\r\n\r\nIf

      the help."
