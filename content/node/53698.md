  recognize it and the other programs don't show the OpenType features that are supposed
  to be included. \r\n\r\nThe seller was Fontshop, I asked for help there but nobody
  answered. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody know how a font buyer can protect himself from non-working
  fonts? Is there any list of trustable sites that sell fonts and support their clients?\r\n\r\nthank
  you\r\nMila"

  body: Hi Mila, having licensed from FS many times and knowing some of the staff
    I have to guess that there has been a hiccup. Or at least I hope so. I've emailed
    Stephen Coles, Type Director at FS, to get him here ASAP.

  body: Mila - FontShop normally answers very promptly on business days. Unfortunately,
    the American office isn't open today because it's a holiday. Feel free to contact
    me at coles@fontshop.com and I'll see what I can do. Short of that, our expert
    tech folks will get back to you first thing tomorrow morning.
