  I have to choose new fonts. I am using a blackletter face but \r\nfor the other
  subheader text, I need to pair the blackletter with\r\nsomething which complements
  or contrasts it and not sure outside\r\nof a geometric typeface what will work with
  the blackletter. I have\r\nyet to choose which blackletter typeface I will use.
  Right now, \r\nthe client needs to have several choices. \r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nBonnie"

    combination can work, if different enough.\r\n\r\nExtremes compliment each other.\r\n\r\nSimple
    geometric fonts work great as a contrast to blackletter.\r\n\r\nEven a really
    fancy script can work in combinations.\r\n\r\nRemember, the more extreme and different
    the two, the better.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
