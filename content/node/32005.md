  every single node of each character is inside the em square, Microsoft Word chops
  off my diacritic charcters a little bit below the top, no matter what the leading
  value is. The most strange thing, however, is that in some sizes (namely 22pt and
  24) it doesn't happen! Since the leading is scaled proportionally, I expected the
  same thing to happen in every size. I wonder wheter it's a Word bug or my font has
  a problem. If that is the case, can anyone help me solve it? The export em sq size
  is set to 1000 in fontlab 5, and in the other apps I ran it, it worked just fine
  (Adobe CS2, Apple TextEdit). Man, how frustrating it can be to generate fonts! I'm
  not even getting to the name issues I'm facing \u2014 the whole cross platform shit
  and such. It's an even worse feeling than that of designing a website and then (try
  to) do the coding in action script. Curiously, every problem I had so far occured
  under microsoft software or others run in Windows... *sight* Oh boy... Anyway, thanks!"

  body: "Yeah, except for the TT specific ones you mention, since I'm outputting it
    exclusively in OTF PS. Should I check it anyway?\r\nBut a funny thing happened.
    Trying to find a way out from the naming mess (I did everything every single post
    I found said to, including the ones from FL developers, and it just wouldn't work),
    I outputted each of the two styles of my font as two separate families with one
    regular style each. It not only solved the naming issue, as apparently now MS
    Word displays my font perfectly. Since it were the only app on my Mac not to recognize
    both styles when they were part of a single family, I'm guessing it had something
    to with the name thing. Go figure... Anyway, thanks a lot for your concern!"
