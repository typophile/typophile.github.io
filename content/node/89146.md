    go with this splendid 'g'?]\r\n\r\nThis year, I'll be at the RIT 'Reading Digital
    Symposium' later this month, and at ISType in Istanbul. Probably also at TypeCon,
    but that's not confirmed yet. Possibly at the Unicode conference in the autumn."

      I think it works best as it''s own icon. I did try to make some matching glyphs
      but it proved rather difficult. Maybe some time I will try again.]'
