body: "When in FontLab a user applies the \"autohint\" function, in the font window
  there will invariably be two horizontal hints ... one at the top of the glyph and
  one at the bottom. These hints are different visually in that one of the lines is
  pink while the other is green.\r\n\r\nHowever when I resize that hint, the pink
  line changes to green. Also if you set a hint on or near the baseline, right click
  the hint and choose \"reverse,\" you'll get the hint with the different color lines;
  and with an arrow on the far right pointing up (which is the direction of the hint).
  I have yet to get this to work in the other direction, however, at the top with
  the arrow pointing down.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering what if anything that pink line
  means, and/or anything else relevant to this scenario. Any insight would be appreciated."

  body: Actually, I think I've solved this. I don't think the pink color of the line
    means anything other than being an indicator of the direction of the hint. I think
    it performs the same function as an ordinary hint with two green lines. This is
    the best I can gather so far, anyway.
