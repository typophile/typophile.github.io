  name: Greater Albion Typefounders
body: "Greater Albion has just launched it's latest to families (one one family and
  one standalone face) on Myfonts.\r\n\r\nMerrivale is an ideal example of the benefits
  of keeping ones eyes open- it was inspired by the gilt-finished raised lettering
  on a late Victorian shopsign in Melbourne, Australia. The family of seven faces
  include upper and lower case forms, small capitals, all capital forms, and flamboyant
  display forms.  Extensive Opentype features are incorporated. All faces are offered
  in incised forms inspired by the original lettering as well as in solid black filled
  forms.  Thsee typefaces are wonderful for signage where either a period air or a
  dignified but legible feel are required.  They also lend themselves to other display
  uses such as posters, book covers and so forth and are ideal for the title lines
  of certificates.\r\n\r\nColiseo is a lively and fun Art Nouveau inspired typeface,
  inspired by stone lettering seen on facade of the Coliseum Theatre in London.  It's
  beautifully characterful let legible making it ideal for poster work or anything
  where it's useful to combine Roman display faces with a feeling of life and energy.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a small sampler showing both families:\r\nhttp://gatf.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/typophile.png\r\n\r\n\r\n"
