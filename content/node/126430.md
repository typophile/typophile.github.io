body: "I couldn't find any forum that was dedicated to user introductions, so I figure
  a forum with the word \"general\" in its name would be a good place to start.  Having
  said that...\r\n\r\nMy name is John Isles.  I'm a lifelong resident of Lancaster,
  California, a city you've likely never heard of, that situated in the Mojave Desert
  roughly 75 miles (or 120 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.  That means if the rumors
  of Los Angeles traffic are consistently true, that's about a five-hour drive on
  a good day.\r\n\r\nI've always been fascinated by typography.  In my younger days,
  I would often look around and say to myself, \"Hey, the font on that speedometer
  is the same one as the one in that Mario instruction booklet\", despite not know
  what the font's name was.  In recent years, I've been looking into getting into
  selling my own typefaces, and I join Typophile so I can help educate myself on the
  finer points of type design through community discussion.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do
  have <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/202044/qxz\" target=\"_blank\">a
  page on Fontstruct</a>, though most of what I have published is recreations of printer,
  computer, and video game fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(P.S.:  If I have happened to place this
  in an incorrect forum, my apologies.)"
