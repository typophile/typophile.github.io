  body: "If you read the magazine http://issuu.com/aurevoirmagazine/docs/aurevoir_n1_single
    you will note that this lettering is used only for the title. The body text is
    in something more conventional.\r\nThe models are also conventional -- starved
    waifs.\r\nAs for the lettering, I suggest that Larish Neue is the closest. It
    has the distinctive serif treatment and a similar look and feel.\r\nDon"
