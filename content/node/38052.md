  two fonts are.  The first one is from the new SMALLVILLE Opening Credit sequence
  and the second is the font used in the SUEPRMAN RETURNS Opening Credit sequence.
  \ The SR font is an outline font.  Here are two screen grabs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Smallville-2005-Opening-08_5090.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superman-2006-Opening_6134.jpg]\r\n\r\nEmail
  me if you know, I'd greatly appreciate some feedback.\r\n\r\nadam.hlavac@gmail.com"

    free, and you won't find the illegal ways here. Many of the members of this board
    make their living designing fonts, so it's probably not a good idea to imply that
    their hard work is not worth paying for.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    you think that? To me they look like two beautiful, carefully designed typefaces.
    I think the people designing them put some serious effort in them. They might
    want to be compensated for their creativity, their skill, the time they put in.
    Doesn't that seem logical to you?"

    free fonts online so i thought it'd be one of them.  i don't look research fonts
    or anything, just try wanted to know what it was.
