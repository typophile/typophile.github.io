  <BR> <BR>New display type, 22 pixel high &#40;2 for ascenders, 4 for descenders&#41;
  <BR>Some international characters miss. <BR>Also started a version anti-aliased
  by hand but it looks crappy. <BR>Let me know what you think.

  body: I really like this. A bitmap font that has some <B>heft</B>. Ymmy! Okay so
    maybe it <I>is</I> more of the display variety, but this is really nice even still.
    Do you plan on designing other weights?

  body: Nice Greg! Bagel was a great name, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s taken. <BR>Reminds
    me of Rundschrift &#40;VAG Rounded&#41;. You  <BR>could derive something from
    that. Rundpixel? Rundbit? <BR> <BR>The &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; are wonderful.
    <BR> <BR>The accented caps are a bit blurry. They may need to <BR>get a bit shorter
    to accommodate the marks. <BR> <BR>This is right up <A HREF="http://www.fountain.nu"
    TARGET="_top">Fountain</A>&#39;s alley. You should bug them <BR>about selling
    it. <BR> <BR>Stephen

    but if i have to choose for a cute-rouded font for flash suppors ..bagel its maybe
    more a display one cause it lost the pixel style feeling of the minifonts&#40;you
    know what i mean&#41;. <BR> But is only a comment, bagel style rules! &#40;please
    make an outline version of bagel!!&#41; <BR> <BR>A Good &amp; Fine Job, <BR> <BR>Miguel '

    you keep it that heavy while low-res and still legible. I dig the fractions. '
