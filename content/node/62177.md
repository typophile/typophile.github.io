  is planing to launch a new set of \u2019Indian Language TypeSet\u2019 soon, which
  will be user friendly by keeping the Indian language authenticity intact. We are
  looking forward for modern Indian typefaces by maintaining the localness in it.
  I hope, we will get the genuine feedback on our work. :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhiteCrow-Sarang-Kulkarni_5912.gif]"
