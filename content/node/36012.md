body: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nI am currently working on the redesign of a magazine about skiing
  and other winter sports and can't seem to find the right font \u2013 since I started
  hanging out in here there's just too many options.\r\n\r\nFor the cover I need a
  clean, modern sans serif with some personality. I really like [[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/
  | Apex New]], but have been using that for other project so I want something new.
  I have also really liked the kinda sporty look of [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik_bold.html
  | Gridnik]] but feel that that maybe that font have been used to much for it's own
  good. The simpler version [[http://www.die-gestalten.de/fonts/detail/?id=be0db8100e54be5e010e5a7b56500004
  | Blender]] is maybe a better option. \r\n\r\nI came across these covers from ESPN
  and must say that I like them.  Does anyone know these fonts? I can recognize Bello
  for the \"don't feed the bears\" script but the others I dont know other than that
  the serif in \"tough town tough race\" that looks a bit like a wider version of
  Base Serif.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BDD_JB_ESPN_mag_5553.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BearsCover_5711.jpg]"

    is used on Cover #1, with Interstate on #2."

    pretty close to Caecilia except for the capital A that has the seme left pointing
    top like Lubalin. (The sans looks like Apex New)\r\n\r\nhttp://staircasewit.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/bobcatssquawk.jpg"
