    some dedication in the OT tables. I've actually become more and more interested
    in Eastern Orthodoxy the past couple of years, and now that I discover Slavonic
    has its own typographical system ... well, shucks! This is just incredible."

  body: "That reminds me a lot of the (still at times used, at least at a lot of Universities)
    Latin script.  Especially the shrinking and squashing of letters to fill in space
    and joining of bars.  It wouldn't just require dedication for OT it'd require
    insanity, sort of like doing Greek ligatures.\r\n\r\nAlso deserving of note is
    that cursive face used on some of the other pages in the book.  Now I'd like to
    see the cursive + ligature (kidding, of course).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

  body: This is very cool stuff indeed - I would love to see a latin font along these
    lines as well. It is strange how elegant & yet gawky it it is. I know that's like
    saying short but tall. But I can't think of another way of saying it.

    unfortunately no long text examples.  I'm looking up to see if I can find any
    Spanish or other language examples of this style.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es

  body: 'These tables show the commonest v''jaz ligature patterns, but they don''t
    show what can happen if two ligature patterns are adjacent and the bordering letters
    are also candidates for ligation: in that case the whole unit may be ligated.
    At that point, one is looking at flexible layout that isn''t really best handled
    with ligature glyphs per se, since it might require thousands of them. The situation
    is akin to that for nas''taliq Arabic shaping. One needs to analyse the joins
    and to break down the ligatures into components that can be contextually built
    up into dynamic shapes.'
