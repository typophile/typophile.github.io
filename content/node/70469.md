  body: I tried to use .BMP but it just didn't worked, since I don't have my laptop
    yet, i'm using a old windows, used paint to convert to .BMP and to convert to
    .TIFF tiff is natural that it did error since it has to be in B&W but BMP? Fontlab
    doesn't even "see" .BMP

  body: "Hello @sendoushi \r\nI had same the problem like you, of course I forgotten
    its solution cause I solved it for myself in bef0re; but today I missed it again.
    So I tried to find a way to solve my problem. after thinking and test different
    ways I found it again.\r\n\r\nIf you open the image that you need for mapping
    in Fontlab in some applications like PS or everything else and copy the image
    to clipboard by selecting image(Ctrl+C), the image going to clipboard and then
    if you go to Fontlab studio and paste(Ctrl+V) buffered image; you get the result.
    also if it doesn't have good view in Fontlab in graphical app first mix it(change
    its mode to Grayscale or Black&White)\r\n\r\nI checked our friends solutions in
    these post but none of them had effect. Firstly I wrote this post for myself for
    when I forget this solution again.\r\n\r\nThanks admin for this forum.\r\nBless
    all of you"

  body: I don't even remember the error. Too long ago. I'm thinking once again to
    back to typeface design and I appreciate your time for the help. Now, if I have
    the same problem, I'll know what to do. :)
