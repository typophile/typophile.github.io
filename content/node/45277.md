    if you are talking about the ct-ligature in general, and the ampersand in general,
    they are not \"glyphs\" but \"characters.\" If you are talking about, say, the
    Garamond Premier Pro ct-ligature and ampersand, those are glyphs."

    thought they mixed it up with the ct-lig. However, for me that glyph (which is
    in that particular font indeed the ampersand) for me looks more like a ct-lig
    than a script-capital-e_t-ligature formed ampersand.\r\n\r\nStill nice to learn
    (and not to be scorned immediately for being in this case stupidly mistaken).

    lots of people would find distracting. '

    rarely used as an alternative. Even so i use it as much as possible, mainly when
    i write &c.\r\nI also must say that, personally, i don't see any problem when
    the et ligature is really obvious... but then again Portuguese words will always
    have a close connection to their Latin predecessors. Et works perfectly on French
    as well, so i can see why some designers are making this ligature more obvious.
    I do understand that in English reading \"et\" may come out confusing but then
    again, in my opinion, the & has it's own reading!\r\n\r\nSorry, if this post got

    think people have a problem with the evident E in the Caslon (and some other old

    is helpful. By the way, it was interesting to me that when I worked on my swash
    italic E, I couldn''t take it from the ampersand. I tried it and it wouldn''t
    work. I did use a curly E but had to change the form pretty completely. (Caslon
    himself never did a swash E. All those are Victorian and later.) '
