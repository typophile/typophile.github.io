  body: Not sure if the original was a typeface or lettering, but there is a digital
    font based on it called <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/AD10149.cfm">Merz</a>
    by Apply Design at FontHaus. I can't tell if an E with the tilted crossbar is
    included or not. Seems not.

  body: I guess I should draw my own, it's just for a single word, display anyhow.
    Thanks though.
