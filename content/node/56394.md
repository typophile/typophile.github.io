  And i could really use some type recommendation / suggestions. To get on with the
  design. The best thing i could find on my computer is Swift, and i like it. But
  i would like something that looks alittle bit more feminin maybe, round and clean.
  \r\n\r\nI have found these two examples to illustrate. The first one are made by
  e-types for the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, i believe it's called Erepublic.
  And the other one are Times Modern.\r\n\r\n Is there something that look alittle
  like these?\r\n\r\nThanks... "

    experience with newspaper design until now. But I think the suggestions of [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/applications/newspaper_text_modern_alternatives/|FONTSHOP]]
    aren't bad at all.\r\n\r\nAnd probably [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/amalia_professional/|AMALIA]]
    and [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text|GRETA]] match your examples a
    bit.\r\n\r\nBut I'm very interested in IDing your second example. I'm quite sure
    its name is not \"Times modern\" though I don't know what its called. I like it
    very much. I hope someone could help."

    Research Studios.\r\nSimilar would be Mercury from H&FJ or Farnham by Christian
