body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI am currently writing a dissertation on type technology,
  focused on developing a workflow for creating multiweight script/cursive families
  utilizing Multiple Master technology and some Metafont/Metapost techniques. To be
  more precise my objective is help the designer in creating calligraphy and brush
  scripts \u2013 of the kind which weight cannot be just changed without complete
  redrawing (you can\u2019t just move stems around). \r\n\r\nThe basic concept is
  to allow the artist to draw his characters in whatever software product he chooses,
  when he/she is satisfied with the result, he imports the centerlines in whatever
  font production software, activates the script, enters brush parameters and receives
  two masters with clean outlines minimum number of points and PS drawing standards
  compliant and etc. It sounds simple and it actually is \u2013 as I have managed
  to create a working model written in Python (proof of concept) and I am currently
  using it for font development. \r\n\r\nSo you all know having working model does
  not complete a dissertation. As I am currently writing the first chapter of my monograph
  I am struggling with the following problem: I cannot seem to find any other authors
  that worked on the same subject \u2013 mutiweight script/cursive families. I know
  that there must be at least couple of authors that have addressed the problem in
  the past. So could you please point me to some articles or books concerning the
  subject? \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\nVassil\r\n"

    that: http://www.kalliculator.com/about/researchpaper.pdf \r\n\r\nIt /was/ written
    as his project for his masters at Type]Media in The Hague's Royal Academy of Arts,
    maybe that's academic level?"

    is a one man company ran by Gustavo Ferreira, who is now a good friend after he
    took me in as an intern last summer and we got to work side by side. His work
    with generative and responsive fonts is really something, the links I put up there
    are from a recent article he wrote about his research, they're not as in depth
    as Frederik's research paper but they might do some good :)"
