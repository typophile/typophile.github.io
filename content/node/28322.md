body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nHere (in the attached file title.jpg) are the title, subtitle, and
  author name from the title page of a book published in 1983. I'm trying to help
  the publisher do a reprint by identifying this italic (probably bold italic) typeface
  for them, but I just can't figure out what it is. Can someone here please help me?\r\n\r\n(By
  the way, I just set up my account, and this is my first posting, so if I've done
  anything idiotic or otherwise totally embarrassing, please let me know!)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for everyone's time, knowledge, and help!\r\n\r\n--John"
