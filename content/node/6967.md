body: The only reason I&#39;m posting this is because there&#39;s been so much talk
  of it lately. I found it on an Italian web site, so don&#39;t get scared about the
  book being in Italian, it&#39;s in english. I don&#39;t want to be attacked personally
  for this. Like I said in one of my other posts, &#34;I feel like I&#39;m opening
  Pandora&#39;s box.&#34; <BR> <BR><a href="http://members.xoom.virgilio.it/dtp/papers/type_by_design/manuale.htm"

  body: Pandora was the coolest party chick. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s interesting that
    this isn&#39;t the same set of PDFs as last time &#40;which was from Brazil&#41;.
    I remember that the previous one had the text in the &#34;authentic&#34; Goudy
    Italian Old-Style, although not the specially modified one Moye used - I remember
    doing a test on the lc &#34;y&#34; to find out, since I was wondering if Moye
    had leaked the original docs, for some reason, maybe out of frustration at the
    dumbass publishers. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>And, with the emergence of FontLab and its OpenType capabilities, its
    not all that useful anymore.

  body: 'not to throw fuel on the fire, but i found type by design useful. i&#39;m
    very new to the field, and after reading it i feel much more confident. it&#39;s
    one of those books that should be required reading in the design schools. '

    basic but there are very important topics there like postcript drawing and spacing-kerning
    issues. '

    28 July 1998 <BR>Hamilton Books are offering Stephen Moye&#39;s Fontographer:

    Type 1 font production, at the price it represents good value for money. '

    my copy &#40;a few dog-earred pages, tiny creases on lower right corner of front

  body: Intriguing price, $1,348.00. Although I doubt they have a copy of the book,
    if they do then their price is mostly wishful thinking. Examination of their feedback
    doesn&#39;t reveal them to be a very upstanding vendor, overall.  <BR> <BR>A careful
    search for the book would probably turn up a very nice copy for substantially
    less money. A large number of libraries across the US show copies in their collections.
    <BR> <BR>My copy, though, is not for sale.

  body: I assume Steve is referring to the PDF sharing. As the link in the original
    post is dead anyway, I neither can check whether it contained illicitly shared
    copyrighted material, nor do I see the need to remove it.

  body: I just thought it was a strange comment, seeing as most of the discussion
    here is (and was, six years ago) about obtaining printed copies of the book.
