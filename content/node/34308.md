  I want to preview any glyph \u2014 I get empty window\r\n\r\n2. I need to type at

  body: "Thanks Alex.  Just read your email; problem solved. Thanks!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe
    problem & the solution:\r\n\r\n \"Both the \"preview problem\" and the\"lack of
    pixel squares\" are the result of one bug in BitFonter's export.\r\n\r\nTo repair
    FontLab Studio, open the Preferences > Glyph Window > \r\nDimensions page and
    change Visual ascender and descender fields to \r\ndefaults: 100 and -40. Then
    you will be able to use the Metrics window \r\nand others.\r\n\r\nBut if you export
    from BitFonter to FontLab Studio again then BitFonter \r\nwill change FontLab's
    preferences back to invalid values.\r\n\r\nBoth problems will be fixed in BitFonter
    3.0.1 release.\"\r\n\r\n---------"
