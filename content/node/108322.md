body: "I'm having a delimma where I'm trying to display quotes/testimonials in a slider.
  The content is dynamic, and varies in length. Most of the comments are approximately
  110 characters, the limit is 500 characters, and there are a fair amount over 200
  characters. It would be disruptive to accommodate the largest comment (500 characters),
  because for most of the comments it would be a huge area of wasted space. We'll
  probably based the amount of space around 250 characters, and then we need an option
  for the comments larger than 250. I can't think of anything that would work well
  in a slideshow because it's constantly rotating. If we just change the height then
  the site will be growing and shrinking a lot which looks weird.\r\n\r\nDo any of
  you know of any websites that handle this gracefully or have suggestions?"
