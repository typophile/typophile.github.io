  it soon becomes confusing:\r\n\r\n\u2018She said \u201CDon\u2019t use the same marks
  for quotation and elisions!\u201D three times.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by
  using the Unicode specified apostrophe mark ('). However I read on every webpage
  on the subject that it looks really unprofessional to use don't instead of don\u2019t.
  I have been suggested to use bold quotation marks. But I mean that looks goofy.\r\n\r\nWhat
  symbols to use?"

    with regional preferences.  Your example appears to fall in line with UK Engilsh
    usage, which is the opposite of the USA usage. I'm not sure what you do in Norway.\r\n\r\nAre
    you asking about the straight typewriter style marks as opposed to the curly quote
    and apostrophe marks one sees in typeset text?\r\n\r\nThe only time to use bold
    marks is when the whole of the enclosed text is also set bold. \r\n\r\nThere is
    some controversy as to whether to add extra spacing around quotation marks, particularly
    the singles so as to distinguish them from apostrophes.\r\n\r\nI'd go into more
    detail, but others can speak on this with more authority and I'm too tired, it
    being near 2 AM here."

    that we use informally in computer communications; these should not be used in

    then double quotes for quotations nested within them.\r\n\r\nUSA usage prefers
    double quotes, and then single quotes for quotations nested within them. It has
    also become popular to use single quotes for isolated terms of one or two words,
    e.g. above."

    is a Typophile thread.\r\n\r\nBritish usage is not \u201Cthe opposite of USA usage.\u201D
    Setting aside for a moment the fact that there is more than one usage in the U.K.
    (e.g., <cite>Monocle</cite> uses British English but double quotation marks at
    first instance), the differences are wider than that. British orthography places
    periods and commas inside quotation marks only for direct utterances and outside
    in other cases. U.S. (also Canadian) usage puts them inside quotation marks always.\r\n\r\nThere
    is no distinction in Unicode between an apostrophe and a closing single quotation
    mark. This is a serious defect, but it will never change. There is also no way
    to distinguish the usages of neutral opening quote, neutral closing quote, and
    neutral apostrophe; they\u2019re all one character.\r\n\r\nThe example in your
    fifth paragraph isn\u2019t realistic, because the whole sentence would probably
    not be quoted.\r\n\r\nIn any event, it is invariant that you alternate double-single
    or single-double when nesting quotes. The only variable is which one you start
    off with. British tends to use single; U.S. and Canadian always uses double.\r\n\r\nAll
    this is easily Googled or, better, looked up in Fowler\u2019s or Strunk and White
    or any English-usage book.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

    we have the MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE. I wonder if that would be the one Joe
    is missing\u2014and the one that would be appropriate for elisions. Even if it
    was, the keyboard accessibility of U+02BC doesn\u2019t go well with the frequency
    of the apostrophe in English language.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is the COMBINING
    COMMA ABOVE (<a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0313\">U+0313</a>) and
    the COMBINING GREEK KORONIS (<a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0343\">U+0343</a>),
    both for combining diacritical marks. They aren\u2019t used in English, however
    they (can) look like the others and shouldn\u2019t be confused."
