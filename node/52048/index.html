  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is another post in which I am asking about the techniques type designers in their own work. How do you determine letter widths and their relationships to each other? Do you plan it all out? Is it handled with reference, based on icons of the genre? Do you drop a grid or control letter in the mask layer or trace over one on paper? Do you just eyeball everything?</div>

Systems have their place if you have a set outcome you are trying to match. Since I am rarely trying to match a preconceived notion, there is no value in applying a system.

I'll go in and start drawing letters, and parts of these form the basis of other letters, but some of these new forms relate to previously drawn ones which must then be changed. This can go back and forth for quite a while.

Other designers have very different processes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The goal as far as widths is to have even color and good rhythm. This dictates a width relationship between the different letters, but it will vary with the design, so as Chris says your eyes have to tell you what is good. I think you have to design the letters adjacent to other letters, and test how well they space with other letters at the same time. And recursively. It makes life easier if you can stick with your control letters--n,o,H,O--and don't have to alter them, but you have to do whatever it takes to make it work well. 

Personally, I also think that the counters in the n,o, and in the H,O need to look visually equal, and the other letters follow suit. I think the divided letters--sae--and t require special care to get right. On the upper case you have more latitude, but some groups of letters need to relate. Eg, you can have a wide or narrow E with the same HO, but then FLT probably have to relate to the E. 

There is a video of Goudy drawing a letter, and he's doing it with two others adjacent. I think the punch cutters did this with smoke proofs also. I would be surprised if even Guttenberg didn't do it. Beyond the basic design idea, much of your design work is getting the letters to work well together. </div>

Not all planned out, usually, but a good sense of the desired result in terms of kind of face. I usually have some exemplars that represent the same basic qualities that I'm after and will refer to them in the process of development, not to duplicate per se, but to have some point of reference. No grid; sometimes a control character; sometimes sketches, if I've worked something out on paper that I'm attached to. 

But, in the end, it all gets adjusted according to eyeball -- 'til it "clicks" and I get the rhythm I'm looking for. (Yeah, I know Hrant hates that word.)

Bill mentions the time-honored control characters n, o, H, O. Logic would dictate that if you just concentrate on these and get them completely right first, then it will save fiddling later with all the derived characters. 

In practice, however, I find that it works better for me to just plow through a good chunk of basic characterss first so I can start judging more in words than in strings. So, more like h n m u r i l o e p b d . Then I can start getting some words going. This means more work when I make an adjustment that affects related chars, but I feel more confident in my decisions seeing them played out more broadly. I guess that's just how I roll. ;-)
