  body: According to the Character Viewer, the only font that comes installed with
    OS X 10.6 and that contains the character "DEVANAGARI LETTER A" is  the font "Devanagari
    MT". It is in the folder /Library/Fonts.

  body: "Another way to check is to install [[http://developer.apple.com/fonts/download/|Apple
    Font Tools]] and use the <code>ftxinstalledfonts -U</code> command that lists
    all installed fonts containing the unicode character given as a parameter. The
    letter DEVANAGARI LETTER A is 0x0905. Here is a trace on my system\r\n<code>\r\n%
    ftxinstalledfonts -U 0x0905 -f | grep YES\r\n111\t65655\tYES\tDevanagari MT\r\n112\t65656\tYES\tDevanagari
    MT Bold\r\n%\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n(with grep, I selected only the lines with YES
    as an answer). If you use <code>ftxinstalledfonts -U 0x0905 -f -l</code> you also
    get the full path of the font file. You can try yourself to see if you get more
    in India...\r\n\r\nEDIT The command will however also list all the fonts you installed
    yourself."

  body: "There are many indic fonts around but they are not interchangeable. The font
    \"Devanagari MT\" is a font with an AAT automaton and using it, Safari can display
    properly http://hi.wikipedia.org for instance. That font can also be used with
    textedit and with pages. So far as I understand, it cannot be used with inDesign
    (correct me if I am wrong). To edit texts with inDesign, you need a properly designed
    opentype font, and it is my understanding that inDesign also still needs a plug
    in to use those opentype flavored fonts. The only tool I know that can use correctly
    both types of fonts is XeTeX. If there is more, I'd like someone to tell. There
    are also other editing softwares that use other encodings. The main difficulty
    with indic fonts is that characters in words need to be reordered (an r can end
    up as an upper diacritic on the next or second next letter, etc.) The software
    needs to be able to handle that. To choose the proper font, you need first to
    consider what software you are going to use.\r\n\r\n"

    what to conclude from my test of which here is a grab. Devanagari MT seems to
    be a fallback font. Verdana contains no devanagari glyph. If I select Devanagari
    MT, the text is not properly formated, but if I choose Verdana, it is, and it
    seems to use glyphs from Devanagari MT. The fonts Sahadeva and Nakula contain
    no AAT functionality. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/devafonts_5483.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    found no documentation on the Inkscape site and I have no time to check. Does
    anyone know how this works?"

    of the most interesting fonts out there, as it makes use of extensive contextual
    alternatives to make the letters fit with their surrounding best. Shown here on
    the section on [[http://www.motaitalic.com/fonts/vesper/contextual-alternates|contextual
    alternatives of Vesper]]. The roman is inspired by Devanagari in the first place.
    I think this typeface family definitely deserves some more attention. "

    renderings are okay, but the source file of the first example (sakred-text.com
    website) has a few textual errors.\r\n\r\nA reliable typesetting example of the
    text chosen by you may be found here:\r\n\r\nwww.sanskritweb.net/rigveda/rv01-001.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    typesetting of this old Rigveda edition is historically interesting in that it
    used two so-called \"split\" PostScript Type 1 Devanagari fonts, because one single
    PS T1 font could not encompass all glyphs needed for rendering Vedic Sanskrit.\r\n"

  body: "Uli\r\n\r\nI was aware of the link you are giving me (and I used it to check
    that my outputs were not too bad). The advantage of a pdf file produced with xeLaTeX
    with an opentype font is that it is searchable with the Acrobat reader (you can
    use a Davanagari keyboard to type in the search window). Also, with the Acrobat
    reader, you can select some Sanskrit text in the pdf and paste it in TextEdit
    or into the LaTeX editing window. To me, that feels much more friendly than using
    itrans, ltrans or the like but I agree that with Velthuis fonts for example, a
    preprocessor and latex, it was possible to produce nice looking outputs; I tried
    that, years ago.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, you are
    no longer forced to work with a very limited number of glyphs."
