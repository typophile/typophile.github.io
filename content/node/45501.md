  - Gujarati)\r\nI opened \u201CGujarati MT\u201D in FontLab but didn\u2019t get any
  type of tables like open type table we see in an OTF font.\r\n\r\nCan any body guide
  me where the table is saved or based up on which information the ATSUI handles the
  proper display of glyphs in conjunct charters?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance\r\nHimanshu\r\n"

  body: Since you are a software developer, you could have a look at the <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/"
    target="_blank"><strong>Fontforge</strong></a> page on <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/gposgsub.html"
    target="_blank"><strong>Advanced Typography Tables</strong></a> which compares
    Opentype and AAT, in particular in what concerns indic scripts and gives hints
    on how to proceed with FontForge. I also noted <a href="http://anakin.ncst.ernet.in/~aparna/consolidated/">this
    link</a> which currently seems to be down. If you open "Gujarati MT" with Fontforge,  to
    see the tables, you select <code>Element > Font Info > Lookups > GSUB</code>.

    required for Indic fonts to work in Cocoa applications on Mac OS X), only OpenType
    Layout tables. Indeed, FontForge or the Apple FontTools package would be more
    appropriate for you. \r\n\r\nA."

    have 10.5 but I saw its handling of a Persian Nasta'liq OT/ttf font which is quite
    complex.\r\nYou may want to test an OT/ttf Gujarati font on Leopard and if satisfactory,
    keep your OT option open."

  body: "10.5 (and every other version of Mac OS) does not support the OpenType features
    needed to set Gujarati (or any other Indic script) properly. It can only do that
    with AAT-format fonts. If you want to make a Gujarati font that is OpenType, it
    will only be able to be used in Windows.\r\n"

  body: "In addition to Dan's post, I'll just add that none of the Adobe applications
    support Gujarati either (neither on Mac nor on Windows). So an OpenType Gujarati
    font can only be sensibly used in applications that use complex script-enabled
    OpenType Layout text engines such as Uniscribe (e.g. Word for Windows), ICU Layout
    (e.g. XeTeX) and, possibly, Pango (in some Linux applications). \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    Indic/Dravidian writing systems, it will be via the OpenType interface, not AAT.
    You can see this in the Flash Player 10 beta, for example....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
