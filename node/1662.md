  design. We&#39;re still missing a few who didn&#39;t convert their fonts to outlines.

  body: ' Yeah. I was down on Futura for a while, in favor of trendier or more obscure
    typefaces. Now I realize the error of my ways. <BR> <BR>Might also be nice in
    New Century Schoolbook, but Futura works for me '

  body: A classic, I agree wholeheartedly. &#40;Unlike Avant  <BR>Garde or Kabel which
    are definitely dated.&#41; But  <BR>Futura is sterile and bleached of any flavor
    --  <BR>which may make it perfect for a given job, but  <BR>perhaps, not this
    one. <BR> <BR>&#40;I had Novell &#40;the network software company&#41; as a client  <BR>once
    upon a time and set one too many words in  <BR>Futura. I need at least four years
    away from it before I  <BR>can look at it without twitching.&#41;
