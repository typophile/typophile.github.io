  body: "Is there some reason that it must be this exact hand-printing font? If not,
    there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of fonts done by amateurs. You
    can see a large sample of them included in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html|Part
    11 of my Script Font ID Guide]]. Five pretty similar fonts shown in the first
    5 or 6 pages are Valley HW, Wolf HW, Jeff HW, Beatty HW and Basha HW. All of these
    come from the ClickArt Handwritten Fonts collection which is now sold by Broderbund
    as part of their newest ClickArt Font collection (should mention '300 handwritten
    fonts').\r\n\r\nYou can also search Dafont.com for handwriting fonts and find
    many free ones.\r\n\r\n(I did look through hundreds of samples before deciding
    this was a better way to answer this question.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. I have also looked through a lot
    of similar fonts and understand that their are many similar alternatives. I really
    like some of the characters in this face and was just wondered if anyone happened
    to recognize it. I need it for a piece I am working on for a children's healthy
    eating campaign, I have tried quite a few alternatives but they all seem to look
    a bit cheap. I think this is really well done for this style of font.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for the links I shall check them out.\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n"
