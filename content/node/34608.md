body: "I don't think this really belong in the ID Forum as it's a source I'm after
  rather than an ID.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find a Windows font of the official Norwegian
  traffic sign font shown in this page from the sign design manual\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TRAFIKKALFABETET_5403.jpg]\r\nthere
  are further showings from page 39 onwards of this <a href=\"http://www.vegvesen.no/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urlpdf&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=SVVvedlegg&blobwhere=1174979504101&ssbinary=true\"
  target=\"new\">PDF</a>\r\n\r\nIt's very similar to various DIN type fonts, but is
  (of course) not the same.\r\n\r\nI found the sign designs (downloadable in a variety
  of formats), but with my non-existant Norwegian I can't find the font anywhere on
  the site.\r\n\r\nI have tried mailing the department, but I've not had a reply yet.\r\n\r\nAll
  help gratefully received.\r\n\r\nRichard"

    -- to the face used on US freeway signs. Check out a pretty good emulation of
    it here: http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Interstate'
