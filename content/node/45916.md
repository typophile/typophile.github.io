body: "I don't know why I didn't notice this before. The Fontlab \"Insert\" command
  is one of the most useful things I have discovered in a while. It's basically a
  paste command that will paste the points in the clipboard in the place of the points
  selected in the glyph window. Here is the use case: you have have drawn out your
  whole font, and all of the sudden you decide that you want to add another  subtle
  curve to each serif. You can:\r\n\r\nA. tweak them all by hand (could take years)\r\nB.
  Try the find/replace (also cool), but since there are likely to be a few points
  that got bumped here and there it won't work.\r\n\r\n[ or ]\r\n \r\nC. Copy the
  fixed serif, and Command+Shift+V insert paste the fixed version on top of each serif.
  Voila! All of your serifs are now updated.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple command, and I don't
  know why I didn't see it before, but I'm glad it found it. It's also great if you
  just want to make sure that all of your serifs are the same, and haven't wandered
  around too much."

    [[http://typophile.com/node/37262|a thread]] long while ago but didnt get many
    replies. Please add this shortcut to that thread so that later we can compile
    a pdf and float over.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it's a VERY handy thing. I've had projects where I used it a lot.\r\n\r\nI
    miss the old FontLab 2.5 subroutine library though. You could just keep something
    like a serif as a separate element and edit it once....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
