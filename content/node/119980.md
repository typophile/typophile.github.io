  - the OX TAIL SOUP typeface - I've looked at Copperplate, Penumbra, Miehle, Symbol,
  can't quite get it right...\r\nAny suggestions from the sleuths would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bbdffbdd_5586..jpeg]"

  body: "Discussed here a few years ago, albeit about more current packaging:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/93388\r\n\r\nConsensus
    seems to be that a proprietary face called TK Super Duper-BG2 is used, which was
    based on historical precedents like your label sample.\r\n\r\nYour sample is pretty
    small, but even when I sought out bigger samples from the same era, I didn't get
    any exact digital matches. \r\n\r\nIn addition to LHF Hensler, mentioned in the
    post above, here are a few others that might work (and, yes, I've included some
    Copperplates):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/ideal-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/44502/CopperplateGothic30BC-product.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/44498/copperplategothic30ab-font.html\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/memo/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/american-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsnerflake/itc_symbol_medium_ot/?affId=98220\r\n"
