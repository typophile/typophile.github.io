  body: "It does look like a font, rather than lettering, due to the repeat letters
    (K, N, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have no idea what typeface this is. Just wanted to say
    how much I like the work of <a href=\"http://www.nikkimcclure.com/\">Nikki McClure</a>.\r\n\r\nHere's
    <a href=\"http://www.buyolympia.com/q/Item=nikki08\">the rest of this calendar</a>,
    in case it helps others to identify the font."

    quite nicely. "

  body: "Josh... Your last comment inspired me to search Google by typing \"nikki
    mcclure font\"... It brought up an interview in which she is asked,\r\n\r\n<strong>And
    what are your thoughts on digital art?</strong>\r\n\r\nHer response: \r\n\r\n<em>Digital
    art? go for it. I use computer to make the printed versions of my pictures...<strong>but
    I also use handcut text in a font that we made</strong>. I want it to be handmade
    without computer text as much as possible. Just like in nature how nothing is
    perfect. There are always holes in leaves, torn edges, no solid color. It is getting
    harder to see these things.</em> [Bold highlighting is mine.]  \r\n\r\n:-)  I
    suppose she is talking about the font in the image you posted.\r\n\r\nThe full
    interview is <a href=\"http://siouxwire-annex.blogspot.com/2007/06/interview-nikki-mcclure.html\">here</a>."

  body: "Thanks for tracking that down Ricardo.\r\nHer work is very beautiful and
    it was very smart of her to create a custom typeface for it. In addition to tying
    in with nature and the subjects of her art, the imperfections in the cut paper
    letters add a level of warmth that a traditional geometric sans could not achieve.\r\nToo
    bad it\u2019s not available. Its very sweet.\r\nJ"
