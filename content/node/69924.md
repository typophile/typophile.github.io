  ornamental counterpart for DTL Fleichmann? I like the style of House Industries'
  Paperback - Etcetera font, but the jagged look of that doesn't work well with DTL
  Fleichmann. Does anybody know any other fonts that has ornaments similar to Paperback,
  but with a Fleichmann-esque look?\r\n\r\nPaperback Etcetera: http://www.houseind.com/fonts/paperback/illustrations\r\n\r\nDTL
