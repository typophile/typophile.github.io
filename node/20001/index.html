  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have in front of me a book called The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, published in 1805 by Cottom and Stewart, Alexandria, Virginia.  In its day, it was a popular book.</p>
<p>The paragraphs are justified. While not annoying, there is quite noticeable variation in spacing between words and spacing in relation to punctuation.</p>
<p>It seems clear that the text would flow better had the paragraphs been set ragged right.</p>
<p>Does anyone know whether obvious variation in spacing is common to &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; books of the 18th/19th century?</p>
<p>If so, why were such books set justified rather than ragged?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the book in question but if there&rsquo;s a noticeable variation in word spacing causing rivers and white blobs, then it wasn&rsquo;t set very well. Justified setting, if done well, should give the page a really nice &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; feel with even colour and I personally think it reads very well as there&rsquo;s no jarring rags to disrupt your reading patterns. I think FL/RR sometimes has an unpleasant texture on the page but this depends largely on the typeface.</p>
<p>Also, most type set in books in the past five centuries have been justified text, even the scribes justified their handwriting in the past.</p>
<p>Others with experience in designing books should be able to answer your other questions!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking at a facsimile of the first, 1896 edition of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook, which was immensely successful. Again, very generous spacing between sentences (I would call it exaggerated). Spacing between words has a somewhat more regular appearance than in the earlier book, but there are still lots of instances of quite noticeable variation.</p>
<p>The justification in both books is inferior, in terms of regularity, to what one sees in more modern books.  On the other hand, it has a certain &ldquo;character&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Style varies over time.
There are a number of things in the Homer page that would be done differently today.
Such as no space before colon and semi-colon, less space before a new sentence, and a tighter Y-e kern.
To my eye, the initial B hangs out too far, and the final period should fill out the measure: is this perception caused by a fault in the original, a difference in personal preference, or the way style changes over time? it&rsquo;s impossible to know.</p>
<p>19th century modern types require ample word spacing, due to the large size of the serifs, and the lack of kerning. Words like New, and You, with a big space between the first two letters, need to be preceeded by plenty of wordspace. Compare Scotch with Times
<img src="/images/old-images/TheNews_5937.jpg" alt="">
I don&rsquo;t think this is a fault of the Scotch (although today one would kern and space it slightly tighter), it&rsquo;s just that subsequently people have preferred a more even letterspacing over &ldquo;full&rdquo; lettershapes; the openness of the Times glyphs would have seemed improper to the Victorians, who found wide open apertures vulgar. In other words, Redge, they paid more attention to letter detail than &ldquo;flow&rdquo; &ndash; meticulous individual grooming being more important than social ease, for a socio-cultural interpretation.</p>

<p>Which begs the question. In the 1970s and 80s, they certainly put great store in spacing type, and to our eyes overdid it, so tight so smooth so grey and ultimately hard to read. Or perhaps they were better readers than we are :-)</p>

The value of anything, including cultural diversity,
depends on context. Do Armenians today gain anything
by using a smaller x-height than the standard approach
to non-Latin type design prescribes? Yes. Did 19th century
Brits gain anything from that loose &ldquo;Ne&rdquo;? If they somehow
did, it must have been microscopic, clearly less than what
they lost: cohesive spacing, leading to greater readability.
Remember that laymen don&rsquo;t deliberate on letterforms at
text sizes.</p>
<p>A designer can wilfully demote instances of good craft due
to whatever other factors, but the overall will remain good
craft only if the designer is aware of what he&rsquo;s sacrificing.
There are elements of good craft that don&rsquo;t change from one
time and people to another simply because of the physical
realities of humans, which now evolve at a pace quite close
to zero.</p>

<p>Your theory is at odds with the facts of history: the Scotch Modern was the main text type style in the US during the latter half of the 19th century, when reading went from being an elite activity to a mass cult of literacy &ndash; public education, libraries, reading clubs, mass circulation magazines and newspapers, Horatio Alger self-improvement. Did all that happen in spite of the type style of the day being so &ldquo;unreadable&rdquo;? Rather, wouldn&rsquo;t it be logical to assume that the type style was a major contributor to the phenomenon &ndash; and that the type style that kick-started mass literacy may well be be the most reader-friendly of all time?</p>

<p>First of all, I didn&rsquo;t say it was highly unreadable. What I said was simply that there&rsquo;s such a thing as Bad Spacing that transcends time and race (because all humans share certain physical traits, that pertain to reading for example), and that &ldquo;Ne&rdquo; suits the description. Second, <cite>of course</cite> the evolution of reading from an elite activity to a populist one could have come in spite of the typestyle. For one thing, aren&rsquo;t you the one always saying that the overall typography is always more relevant than the mere specific type? Not to mention that there are factors way more relevant to such a societal shift than typography. Lastly, Scotch could (and I think does) have other attributes that made up for that lousy spacing (which I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re correct in considering a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of the style).</p>

<p>Yes, and that means that everything that makes up the whole is important and indispensible.
So Scotch spacing is not good or bad against some absolute, it&rsquo;s the best spacing for the Scotch style, and for the kind of page layouts, printing, literature, etc., etc., that the Scotch was used for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, thanks Norbert.  I did a little searching. I was hoping to get &lsquo;lucky&rsquo;. I spent about 8 bucks on the chance. It happens you know. I&rsquo;m curious, Norbert. How did they edition then? Because even the page you posted above is different in &lsquo;my&rsquo; edition. It says &lsquo;copyright 1932 bruce rogers&rsquo; as well, if he copyrighted it, did he design/print it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of what I&rsquo;ve found listed by rare book appraisers:
<em>
Gilt roundel on title-page. 
10x6, full vermilion morocco, spine gilt-lettered with raised bands, top edge gilt. 
No. 9 of 34 copies, of which 25 are for sale. 
First American Edition.
Extremely rare first edition of Lawrence&rsquo;s translation of the Odyssey, published in the same year as the first English edition of 530 copies (priority not known). This American edition was published in a run of 34 copies; of which, according to O&rsquo;Brien, only 11 were bound in full morocco. The book was designed and commissioned by Bruce Rogers.</em></p>
<p>Which seems to indicate that the run of only 34 <em>First American Editions</em> (with gilt roundels) are the extremely rare ones. 530 <em>First English Editions</em> were also printed in 1932. Though the pic you show reads &ldquo;copyright 1932 Bruce Rogers&rdquo; and title page &ldquo;New York/Oxford University Press/1932&rdquo; it lacks the gilding of the <a href="http://www.pbagalleries.com/search/item_img.php?acq_no=157310" target="new">34 rare editions</a>.</p>
