body: 'Has anyone ever heard of B&amp;P Graphics? This font came from one of our sales
  reps and my boss wants to use it on the uniforms we manufacture. I have been trying
  to find out where it came from but I don&#39;t find B&amp;P Graphics or the name
  Stafford Extra bold on the MyFonts.com. <BR> <BR>It looks similar to Egyptienne
  and some others so I am a little wary. But it seems to vary in the details &#40;see
  lc &#39;x&#39;&#41;. But I don&#39;t have a copy of Egyptienne to readily compare
  it with up close. I&#39;ve attached a .swf so that you can examine the specimen
  more precisely. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR>Tom<!--attachment: stafford-6332.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*9.2*Stafford+Extra+Bold*stafford%2eswf

    but couldn&#39;t place it. <BR> <BR>Sigh, story of my life. <BR> <BR>

    version is different, much wider than the one in your sample. '

  body: I know about the UC &#39;X&#39;, Roger, that&#39;s why I wrote &#34;Looks
    like it&#34; ;&#41; Also, it&#39;s nice how the arms are offset in relation to
    each other. Tom, maybe try Rockwell Extra Bold from other foundries at MyFonts?
    Sometimes there are crucial details that are quite different between versions.  <BR>I
    did a quick research, and that&#39;s the closest I could get without spending
    too much time on this ID &#40;I&#39;m in the middle of two urgent newsletter redesigns&#41;.
    Stymie Black is also similar, but the lowercase is more off.  <BR>  <BR>Yaknow,
    Karen, I&#39;m actually desperately trying to get <i>off</i> that friggin&#39;
    roll. =D No, just kidding, I want to cram in as much fun as possible before I
    sign off at work &#40;in ten minutes or so&#41;, because after that I&#39;m pretty
    much out of the loop. I&#39;m not sitting at my computer all night too! I can
    only spend an hour or so with my kids before they&#39;re off to bed, and most
    of that time is spent cooking.

  body: Tom, If you want to use something like this, I recommend <BR>Frutiger&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/serifa/black/" target="_blank">Serifa</a>.
    It&#39;s much cleaner and more well-proportioned.  <BR>And why round dots on Rockwell?
    Senseless and ugly. <BR> <BR>Incidently, Serifa Black looks great at 72 dpi too.  <BR>See
    <a href="http://www.coudal.com/" target="_blank">Coudal Partners</a>.

  body: BTW, &#34;B&amp;P&#34; stands for &#34;Brendel &amp; Pabst&#34;. AKA &#34;Quick
    Brown <BR>Fox&#34;. AKA Brendel Informatik. AKA Type &amp; Workshop. <BR> <BR>You
    can see Stafford at their sorry <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank">website</a>
    in the &#34;SERIALS  <BR>typecollection&#34;. I think Yves is right, it&#39;s
    their own version  <BR>of Rockwell.

  body: I have to agree with the round dots on rockwell and stafford. Thanks to all
    for the id and alternative recommendations. Serifa looks like the best option.
