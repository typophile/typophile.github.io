  body: "You can find similar fonts searching at MyFonts (for example) with the term
    \"Solid\". I could not see any that were identical to these letters. The Solotype
    Catalog also showed some similar styles, like Theda Bara & Guggenheim (p.48),
    but these were not matches either.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that just these letters
    were made for this poster (?), using geometric solids, or simply drawing the shapes.\r\n\r\n-
