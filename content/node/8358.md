  body: Charles, this looks like hand lettering to me. I think the counters in the
    A&#39;s are not identical, and the S&#39;s also look slightly different.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d be happy to try to help find a similar font, or if you want to look
    for yourself, Part 6 or Part 5 of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide</a> would be where I would have collected
    similar styles.
