  me to Typophile in the first place: To make a characterful text font. My <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/91743\">first
  attempt</a> failed almost immediately, but I've learned a lot about type design
  in the meantime. \r\n\r\nI'd like to make <strong>Traction</strong> the female hiking
  boot of oldstyle fonts: Sturdy and functional, a grippy all-terrain profile, yet
  organic and human, and within the constraints of practicality as elegant and sexy
  as possible. The main \"bite\" should come from bold, almost exaggerated serifs,
  reminiscent of slab serifs, and broken strokes that reinforce the glyph where it
  is most needed.\r\n\r\nMy main inspirations are Quadraat, Marlene, and most importantly,
  Satyr. I'm avoiding looking at those typefaces now in order not to plagiarize them
  too much. Hopefully my own take will ultimately stand on its own rather than look
  like an obvious derivative.\r\n\r\nHere are my first two letters:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_3763.png]\r\n\r\nWhaddya

    'a' is a little tight in their southern junctions? That might be unproblematic
    at larger sizes, but I would have let in some air down there anyway. Personally,
    I'd open up the bottoms of 'n' et al too, but that is a matter of taste. \r\n\r\nIt
    is not a bad idea making the right leg of 'n' more similar to the back of the
    'a', I think. Don't worry about being derivative. All designers are inspired by
    other people's work. When I drew Satyr I had Mrs. Eaves (!) in mind. \r\n\r\nKeep

    serif on {n} a chance, but didn't like it. I feel like the glyph is tap-dancing
    (see below). Not at all what I'm going for...  I think I'll stick to my merely
    moderately unusual {n} for now.  ;o)\r\n\r\nAnd while I love ligatures, I'm not
    sure this it the right font for going crazy with them.  I'll certainly have some
    non-standard ones like {tt, Th, Qu} and the like, but apart from that? Do you
    have an example of what you're thinking about?\r\n\r\n@ Craig: I gave the top
    of the {t} just a little nudge upwards... wouldn't want to go farther than that;
    I'm a big fan of low and wide {t} designs.  Added weight to the bottoms of {e}
    and {c}; looks better indeed. \r\n\r\nYes, the top serif of {n m r} exemplifies
    this rubber sole grip feeling I'm trying to evoke. Added two units to the thickness
    of the top serif in ; tried more but it started to look out of place.\r\n\r\n@
    Sindre: I haven't really thought about the {s} yet; I'll see when I get there.
    \ ;o)  \r\n\r\nI made the {a} wider by 10 units and broke the foot away from the
    bowl. Yep, big improvement. {d} was a lot airier than my previous {a}, though,
    so I left it unchanged for now.\r\n\r\nI tried reducing the inside serifs on {n},
    but didn't like the resulting feel of {nn} sequences. Reducing serifs in a grippy
    font just seems off anyway.  ;o) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T4_5234.png]\r\n\r\nOh,

      of crazy?  ;o)  In any case, I'll ban it to .ss01.\r\n\r\nIt's tempting to keep
      the sort-of-binocular (sesquiocular?) {g}, but wouldn't it be at odds with the
      single-storey {a} then? Or should I try to come up with a more handsome monocular
      {g}?\r\n\r\nI've tried tinkering with the baseline serifs, but they immediately
      start looking too low to my eyes if I budge them...\r\n\r\n<em>Do you intend
      to force weights to the same advance width?</em> \u2014 Not really, it just
      came out that way in this quick-and-dirty tryout. Actually, weight change is
      something I've never really done successfully (I did it for Backstein, where
      it was much easier than usual, and still I didn't like the results much). I'm
      actually thinking of outsourcing the job.\r\n"

    amazing design so far. Are you still working on this? It reminds me of some of
    Brian Zick's unreleased work. Not distinctly, just the amount of innovation present.
    Not over the top, but still very refreshing, which I think is a perfect formula."

    not leaving me a lot of spare time. I have a more or less finished (or at least
    stabilized) complete weight with italics and smallcaps ready, and am collaborating
    with Mekkablue to expand that to a wider range of weights. \r\n\r\nYou can see
    a specimen of the current weight here:\r\nhttp://www.cinga.ch/type/Traction_specimen.pdf\r\n\r\nClearly,
    this weight is too heavy for body copy. It will probably end up as the Medium,
    with a lighter Regular and Book intended for body copy, as well as Light, Thin,
    Semibold, Bold, and Black for editorial work. I do see the Medium as sort of the
    default weight for branding, though."

    the capital version. The bump in the curve irritates me, and as a whole it looks
    a bit unbalanced to me (a bit top-heavy perhaps). I am no pro, just a type geek,
    and would like your perspective on this."

    glad to see that the \"chunkiness\" and \"gnarliness\" that the default weight

    interpolating down to lighter weights. I still think it needs to become a bit
    sleeker and lighter for comfortable reading, but for that I'm planning to widen
    the sidebearings. Maybe I should also tone down the fat terminals a bit in the
