  logo and can't remember what the name of the font is. I'm from Sweden (so is the
  company, if you're wondering) and the name reads; \"F\xD6RETAGSlabbet\", which in
  English should be something like \"COMPANYlab\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\nJocke,
  Sweden"

    that's the logo I was referring to (thank you p01ak).\r\n\r\nAnd big thanks to
    Jan for the heads up!"
