    you can download immediately after ordering.\r\nFonts are software which must
    be licensed. Period.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, ask the designer to prepare a new Illustrator
    file with fonts converted to outlines."

    I assume you do not work for free. Ask your designer for a PDF to get the job
    printed or buy the font so the type designer can get paid too. You will then have
    the use of it for hundreds of jobs.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    that is obviously <em>designed this well and maintained</em> is going to give
    you something for free? Hey, I work in a mine shaft...why don't I just give you
    that diamond I found there yesterday?\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can put a disclaimer
    on Typophile on the mainpage that says \"not for free fonts\" or something?"

    just no excuse for that kind of sloppiness in todays world; back in the day, the
    prepress people would make a phone call, send a bike and expect the missing font
    or a replacement .ai file by return \u2013 and they'd charge for the intervening
    time. Which rock has this 'designer' been living under for the last decade?"
