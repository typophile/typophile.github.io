  the engraving of coins breed the making of typefaces?\r\nIs there an economical

    B.C., with King Croesus of Lydia.\r\nTypecasting didn't happen for more than a
    thousand years thereafter."

    for punchcuttery. Seals, dating back to the mess in potamia were produced in limited
    editions for official use, until metal became less precious, and note they used
    one of the less precious metals once they started making type.\r\n\r\nBut minting,
    \ gun, and other weapon making, and  gold smithing, we know were all related to
    early famous type designers. Near the end of punch cutting, at least in the U.S.,
    founders were based in places where there were significant clusters of industrial
    engravers and machines were made, like Milwaukee, Chitown, St. Louis, and the
    industrial centers of the northeast. In Philly, NY, and Boston, they made coins
    too.\r\n\r\nAll these places and more, had people skilled enough, e.g. to make
    very tiny parts for early watches, and kinds of less tiny but still very small
    gears and nuts and bolts... You know parts, and every one of those parts, started
    on a drawing board, ended with a master drawing, and proceeded to production to
    tolerances reaching 1/10,000 of an inch by 1900 or so.\r\n\r\nBy then bridges,
    telegraphs lines, and a few inside inventions, made the Linotype machine go viral,
    and that changed a lot. Whether making coins breeds type, great great great grampa,
    I'm thinking."

  body: "The connection between coins and type is that the minting of coins was a
    pre-existing technology that used letter punches in the making of coin dies. Whoever
    introduced the use of letter punches and matrices into typefounding was probably
    inspired by the letter punches used in making coins, but it's worth noting that
    the styles used were different. Early type was usually bastarda or textura, whereas
    the letter punches used on fifteenth-century coins in Latin Europe were normally
    lombardic.\r\n\r\nIf Needham and Ag\xFCera are correct that Gutenberg wasn\u2019t
    using punches and matrices, then minting technology contributed to a subsequent
    improvement of Gutenberg\u2019s technology, not to its initial creation."

  body: "One web page giving an account of their research said \"The scholars said
    they discovered that individual letters differed in shape from one another in
    such a way that they could not have come from the same metal mould. For example,
    the \u2018A\u2019s, \u2018B\u2019s and so forth on any given page on Gutenberg\u2019s
    papal bull are not always exactly the same shape.\"\r\n\r\nI really hope this
    was garbled. Scholars of printing long knew that Gutenberg had two forms of each
    letter, to simulate the effect of a hand-produced manuscript with movable type.\r\n\r\nIf
    Needham and Ag\xFCera actually discovered that there were many more than two forms
    of each letter, so that Gutenberg really printed from, say, hand-carved wood blocks,
    contrary to popular belief, that would be a major discovery. If, on the other
    hand, they jumped to their conclusion because of the two forms of each letter
    that were already well known, because they put a magnifying glass to Gutenberg's
    Bible without doing a <strong>literature search</strong> beforehand...\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    A fuller account, at\r\n\r\n[[http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/history-science-technology-and-medicine/history-science/the-discovery-changed-our-view-gutenberg]]\r\n\r\nis
    now leading my thoughts in the direction labelled \"deliberate hoax\", rather
    than the previous conclusion of \"unutterable stupidity\".\r\n\r\nThis is because\r\n\r\n\"To
    their surprise each letter in its many reproductions on each page varied, even
    though they could find identical repetitions of that letter on other pages.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    either Gutenberg still made use of movable type, even if by cutting up his woodblocks
    into pieces to re-use the letters (one can't really say he invented it, of course,
    thanks to Pi Sheng)...\r\n\r\nor, instead, we are in error to think that Linn
    Boyd Benton originated the typographical use of the pantograph!!!!\r\n\r\nAnd
    if <em>that's</em> true, then all I've got to say is\r\n\r\n\u266B <em>God didn't
    make little green apples,/and it don't snow in Indianapolis/in the summertime</em>
    \u266B\r\n\r\nFor another musical selection, connected to cutting-edge research
    on the history of technology of apparently similar quality, go here:\r\n\r\n[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhwkdJfsAKg]]\r\n\r\nAt
    least the music was well done...\r\n\r\nOh, wait; I <em>am</em> being too harsh.
    If Gutenberg did invent/use movable type, but not punches and casting molds, then
    perhaps they were merely claiming that Gutenberg used individual hand-made movable
    types. That would explain no two letters on the same page ever being identical,
    which is what they claim to have seen.\r\n\r\nThe Press has been known to badly
    garble the results of research before. Or it is but my own failing in not reading
    the post mentioning them more carefully, which did speak but of punches and matrices,
    although the web articles I found spoke of movable type itself.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Searching
    for images of the pages of the 42-line Bible led me to this more conventional
    research,\r\n\r\n[[link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10032-010-0140-6#page-1]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    claims the use of multiple matrices for each letter as a <em>recent discovery</em>,
    rather than something that was long known. The paper dates from 2010, and I thought
    I had seen the alternate forms of Gutenberg in books on typography from the 1970s
    if not earlier."
