    say that I think most entries have been lame - but seeing as I haven&#39;t come
    up with anything myself then who am I to judge... '

    tee&#39;s me off more than threadless.com. 5inch and the lot of them <BR> <BR>not
    only is it spec-orama work, but it barely classifies as t-shirt design more like
    &#34;put anything on a shirt&#34;-&#34;for no apparent reason&#34; and have the
    public vote on how cool is it. <BR> <BR>Its the colouring book contest of this
    century, not design. there&#39;s no point to them. just stay within the lines.
    perhaps it keeps the kids off the streets but its not design! designers work for
    a client, purpose, with strategy. grrr '

    our muse...to see if we can persuade. <BR> <BR>the only people who target &#34;public&#34;
    in whole to become client are either a&#41; megacorps or b&#41; completely nieve
    &amp; have no business plan or goals. <BR> <BR>you may call threadless, 5inch
    submissions &#34;Art&#34; or illustrations but not design. I guess I just hate
    how freely the word is used nowadays

  body: ' I am a Designer but I secretly wish I was an Artist. I&#39;m a better programmer
    than painter. I dont draw I code. Designer has lost its meaning. To me to be a
    Designer means I arrange things in a pleasing fashion for client or public consummtion.
    But is Designer a dirty word these days. It seems so plain. SAme with web designer.
    Programmer actually sounds more offical. Anybody else have a feeling about what
    is Design and what it means to be a Designer in this day and age. '

    something i notice a lot in the web design community is the confusion between
    design and illustration - there is too much self-indulgent decoration and not
    enough communication. i know you need to push boundaries etc. but when everything
    has the same style applied regardless of the project surely that isn&#39;t &#39;design&#39; '
