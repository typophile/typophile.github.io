  body: Tiffany did you get U&amp;LC in the Herb Lubalin days? The lower case e&#39;s
    look stretched. Dan

  body: Yes, U&amp;lc is part of my &#34;library&#34; next door in storage. I have
    a bunch of them and want desparately for a proper place to keep them. -- I think
    the whole thing has been stretched a bit, good point.

  body: ITC Serif Gothic does in fact have some alternates, including the e, if I
    remember correctly. I&#39;ll see if I can find a visual reference when I get home
    tonight. I&#39;m pretty sure that the Phil&#39;s Fonts <i>Homage to the Alphabet</i>
    one-liner showed all of them.

  body: Cool BJ, do you know what happened when they digitalized serif gothic and
    avant guarde. Why didn&#39;t they diditalize the alternates. Someone mentions
    a Australian site for avant guarde alternatives but there is no way to buy them
    from that site. <BR>I love some of the alternate characters like the cap E.  <BR>Very
    cool post.

  body: As promised &#40;even though BJ beat me to the punch...&#41; here&#39;s a
    scan of two of the Serif Gothic weights from my Phil&#39;s Fonts book. There are
    also examples of the Light, Extra Bold, Heavy, Black, Bold Outline, Open Bold
    and Bold Shaded in the book. <BR> <BR>Ah, the seventies... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19031.gif"

  body: very interesting to see this stuff...thanks Grant. <BR> <BR>At a local bookstore,
    I found an old Compugraphics catalog <BR>&#40;circa 1985&#41;. For ITC Serif Gothic,
    it shows some more alternates not pictured in your sample.  <BR>The catalog calls
    them &#34;unique complement characters&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post a scan soon.
