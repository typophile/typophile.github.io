The client requested one direction to be particularly clean, modern, no gimmicks. Much like [[http://www.vertu.com/]], [[https://www.flyvictor.com/]] or [[http://www.bang-olufsen.com]]. 

Attached, two superposed versions. How does Frutiger hold up?  Knul in small caps looks a bit too playful to me, however it really works here  [[https://www.blackjet.com/]]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're right, Captain. I've considered dropping "yachts" (still do), then moved in another direction as I felt I was lacking "substance" just with the letters M-E-R-A. But then, it would be more memorable to integrate the idea of "more" or "beyond" into the logo, instead. 

Simplifying to one word, I believe the version using slab serif "Vitesse" would work well. Simple, solid, confident. Like Hermes, [[http://www.hermes.com/]]. Only disadvantage is one competitor using it already (not for their logo, though, but for headlines on their website). FF DIN could work as well, but less unique. 

Exploring a "handwritten" version was suggested by the client, inspired by the Bmw GranLusso logo. But I'll advise them not to proceed in this direction. It's out of context. 

What do you think?

		<div class="commentbody">Dropping "yachts" seems like a good idea. The photography & marketing will communicate what the product is.

Not sure about "If you can build yachts, why sit on the beach?" I'd assume that people buying a yacht are already into boating.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally I don't think I would choose a slab serif font; somehowdoesn't feel luxurious enough. The scriptish font (Mera Yachts) looks like it belongs on an outboard motor or a fishing reel. I don't think all lower caps is best for conveying luxury.

I like the one in the bottom right corner best, but with only four letters you could also do a custom design. You're not limited to pre-designed fonts. If I were doing this, I would explore the resemblance of the M to a trident. (I would expect "Mera" will make most people think of "mer" sooner than "mehr".) Or I would remove the crossbar from the A and make the M look like two A's stuck together.

Agree with JamesM. "If you can build yachts, why buy one from us?"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for your opinion, gentlemen. Brandon or Futura, bottom right, will be one of the versions. The trident is a nice idea, but I'd rather keep the concept more minimal. The crossbarless A is an option, though. I dropped the idea of using the slab serif (Vitesse) also because of a competitor using it extensively. It's uncommon for a premium brand, so you notice it even better. As for that sentence, I guess you're both right!
