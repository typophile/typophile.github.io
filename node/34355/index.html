  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fontdesigner by education, just a hobbyist who enjoys making his own fonts. Due to this fact, I&rsquo;m forced to educate myself by experimenting &amp; consulting forums such as Typophile.
My question to all you professional fontmakers out there is if there&rsquo;s a way to work with a pixel based grid in Fontographer (I&rsquo;m working with 4.1.4)? I usually draw my fonts in Illustrator &amp; import them into Fontographer, but somehow Fontographer seems to alter the proportions just a smidge. When making pixelfonts the problem arises that you&rsquo;re not actually basing the font on pixels, but on geometric calculations that are then recalculated by Fontographer &amp; for which I haven&rsquo;t found out yet how to control this (when importing EPS-files Fontographer automatically &ldquo;fits it into the character box&rdquo;). When typing with a homemade pixelfont, you can not enhance its legibility by adjusting the fontsize because of these recalculations (and when converting it to outlines, you discover the tiny adjustments Fontographer made (the proportions are no longer exact)).
Basically, I&rsquo;m wondering if you can use a grid in Fontographer to make pixelfonts by just &ldquo;mapping the pixels out&rdquo; on a grid-/bitmap. Any tips concerning pixelfonts will be much appreciated.
I&rsquo;m completely clueless to Fontographer (except for the things I&rsquo;ve figured out myself) &amp; any tips on how to adjust the leading for a font and such would also really be a great help to me at this point.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, you really want to do a pixelfont in the font editing app, not Illustrator. Whatever &ldquo;drawing comfort&rdquo; you might have with Illustrator is virtually irrelevant in a making a pixelfont. Second, you want to shoot for a point size of 8 (unless your font is very intricate/large) mostly because that&rsquo;s what pixelfont users expect (but also because it&rsquo;s possible to use the font in &ldquo;native&rdquo; Windows, at a size of 6). So in an Em space of 1000, you set your grid to 125 ems, since that&rsquo;s what 1000/8 is. The rest is just boxes. Although there is the issue of how the boxes should abut&hellip; A primitive solution can be found in Unibody - a free download - check it out. A more sophisticated solution is to offset the vertices by 1-2 ems to either get the boxes to merge slightly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I already knew that drawing the fonts in Illustrator was a bit of a detour, making things unnecessarely complicated, but since I&rsquo;m so used to Illustrator, I always end up drawing in them (it&rsquo;s like a sketchbook to me). Thanks to your tips, I might actually be able to do the &ldquo;executed&rdquo; drawings in the proper application now (I never figured out the whole relation between em-squares &amp; pixels on my own).
I&rsquo;ll make sure to check out that Unibody.
I also found a link to Minifonts that could prove helpful.
Thanks again for helping a stranger! ;-)</div>
