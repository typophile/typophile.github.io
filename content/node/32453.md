  body: I really like the logo, but the Bodoni isn't working for me. It just commands
    so much attention with all of its contrast and fanciness. I think Bodoni or Didot
    could work, but I'm not a fan of how you have set the type in relation to the
    mark. Right now, the type is competing with the logo. Perhaps the logotype is
    a sans face instead? Something to allow your logo more visual presence.

  body: "there is something a little too sharp and edgy in the upper example's serifs.
    \r\n\r\nsomething in the black color (real color, not typographic) isn't sensitive
    enough near that symbol. perhaps you might try toning down the black just a little
    so it would't threaten that lovely symbol you've designed.\r\n\r\noverall it's
    good, i really enjoy looking on it."

  body: "what's with the angel like shape? I don't mind the infinite loop and longevity,
    the colours, type choice and style of the '8' don't seem connected at all (in
    my opinion).\r\n\r\nAm I missing something about the 8th day? what's it a reference
    too? It's only wording I know but I also don't understand the use of \"organic
    wellness spa\" - sounds like simply throwing organic in there to make people think
    it's 'nicer'\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

    body: 'Paul, it''s simply a refernce to giving your self a whole "new" type of
      day, a new outlook, organically speaking. It''s not just an organic spa, but
      it preaches and teaches organic lifestyle. Hope that ties it together a little
      more. I''m not super happy with the way the logo ties into the typeface but
      at this point im exhausted, suggestions as to how to tie them together would
      be greatly appreciated. '

  body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI like the upper right one, feels like wellness. You might move
    the logo a bit down, it feels more compact when you look at it."
