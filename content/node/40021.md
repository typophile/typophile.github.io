  from Publix Super Markets. I tried identifont and WTF to no avail. Thought I'd serve
  it up to the experts... also, if no one knows the exact font I'd be interested in
  recommendations for similar fonts; I was really attracted to the lowered X height
  and the simplicity of the letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4656.jpg]"

  body: ah... yes, no wonder I was in the dark... so rarely have any money to purchase
    fonts around here. Thanks guys! Strange that identifont didn't hit on it?

    wouldn't get it - but if the person tried it would go to the general board and
    would have been nailed in under 4 minutes by any of the regulars.... Really. \r\n\r\nNeutraface
    is a very popular face!\r\n\r\nP.S. I removed Bogie's photo -- this one is of
    Ollie with Lauren. He's almost 9 months old.... they grow up fast.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.
    Dali137 - what name to you go by at WTF. I don't see you there..."

  body: "Identifont is not that useful, I find. They ask a million questions about
    characters you rarely use like Q and J and fail to ask some very basic questions
    about the type of font it is, that might narrow things down a lot further.\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont
    wouldn't get this either because MyFonts doesn't carry House Industries fonts.
    They only search their own database.\r\n\r\nI find Bowfin can be useful for this
    sort of thing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\r\n\r\n(edited,
    so will fall out of order...)"
