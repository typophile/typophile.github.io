body: Hi there, for the logo typeface of Anthropologie, my professor told me that
  it is Mrs. Eaves but with some typewriter fonts here and there. For what I see,
  all are Mrs Eaves except the letters "T, R, O, G, I and E", can anyone tell me if
  I'm correct? And what Typewriter fonts are used here? THANKS!
