  Book, a cute little P22 catalog and a FontShop 2004/2005 addendum.  Wait. 04.05
  ? Anyway.\r\n\r\nI need some advice in mocking something up. I attached a pdf of
  the page cover in question. I'd like to mock it up how I spec'd it for the project,
  colored paper with 3 colors on the front, one of which is white. When I turned it
  in before I did the whole photoquality epson matte paper on boards, but I have an
  interview (!) the week of the 22nd and would like to have it lookin' good. So the
  question is, without screen printing, is it possible to mock up a hit of white ink
  on colored paper ?   \r\n\r\nSee pdf.\r\n\r\nThx everyone"

    making the \"95\" superscript, with some mark under it. And can you make it $8?\r\n\r\nWill
    you be tweaking the spacing on the all-caps? It's all over the place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    tricky, but it might work... Stencil with spaces left out for letters... Liquid

  body: There are one-off printers that can do an opaque white. Call around. Many
    market themselves as doing high-end comps of packaging. The printers are ink-jets
    with a white cart.

    check the spacing, too. The different words have different spacing and there\u2019s
    variation inside them, too.\r\n\r\nHrant: Why wouldn\u2019t you use old style
    numerals? It is \u2018.75 times the H height\u2019 high numbers you are suggesting,
    right?"

    but in the context of the top two lines, and how the roman\r\nnumerals [need to]
    look, lining (yes, between the x-height and caps) seems to\r\nmake more sense.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm a little late to the game, and this has nothing to do with producing
    a mock-up with white, but - despite the simplicity of the design - does no one
    else find the typography busy? Or the blackletter a closed fist to the face?\r\n\r\nThe
    latter is way too overbearing to my mind and is effectively screaming at me (sshhhhhh).
    At the very least I think I'd pull the tint back a bit.\r\n\r\nThe former has
    too many competing styles going on: the top italics, the middle caps, the bottom
    caption; each of these three units has a different personality, and they're jockying
    too much for distinction. Any reason that these three units aren't in the same
    type?\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weight issue with the small-cap/all-cap setting
    in the middle. Are those small-caps? Or just smaller caps?\r\n\r\n"

    for custom rubdown lettering, somewhere like this would suit for the frame (or
    if you get the whole lot made up into a composite rubdown you could then apply
    it to a sheet, get at least two though, because it can be tricky stuff if you're
    not used to it).\r\nhttp://www.allout-graphics.com/\r\n\r\nJust as an aside do
    you intend for the image to print in white as an overprint, if so you should be
    able to get an inkjet to print the 4 colour breakdown onto the coloured paper
    to simulate it.\r\n\r\nTim"
