body: "I\u2019m in the process of redesigning a newspaper, and I\u2019m wondering
  if there is a way I can more accurately print proofs. Crisp laser printouts are
  nice, but I want get a feel for how the design will work in its \u2018native\u2019
  media.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience putting newsprint through an inkjet printer?
  Can it be done effectively? I\u2019m pretty sure I can get some of the same paper
  the news is printed on.  \r\n\r\nMy other alternative is to experiment with type
  in a house/fill ad that runs in the actual newspaper. This is probably most accurate,
  but totally up to chance, and only available once a week.\r\n\r\nAny advice or information
  is most appreciated. Thanks."

  body: Hmmm...you don't think there is a chance of getting really close with newsprint
    in an inkjet? Or at least close enough to be worth the trouble? Thanks for the
    reply Nick.

  body: Inkjet ink and lithographic press printing ink are two different animals;
    even if you could feed newsprint through an inkjet printer (an iffy proposition,
    given how flimsy newsprint is), the inkjet ink may well bleed on the cheap paper...

  body: I don't think inkjet will be a accurate simulation, but if you want to test
    it then duplicate a small section from a previous issue -- same font, same point
    size, etc -- and compare the printed results.

    of the faces you are considering, here and there in their present publication."

  body: "A while back when I became curious what Patria would look like in a newspaper
    I tried just that. I bought \"newsprint\" paper and ran it through my inkjet.
    The bleed was out of control. So it's like people are saying here. And really,
    it's not too hard to swing some inclusion in an actual newspaper issue.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER,
    I can imagine a way, for somebody who needs quick iterative proofing showing something
    that comes close to the final product:\r\n\r\nGet the font your target newspaper
    is currently using, and instead of using newsprint in your inkjet find a paper
    stock that gives very close results to the real thing when printed on your inkjet.
    Then use that paper with your proposed font to proof away!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: When you are testing for a newspaper, you are testing the total combination
    of variables, not just paper.  There is no point in bothering with inkjet on newsprint,
    whatever it is, it is nothing like what the real thing will be.  You might try
    making some test words in your font with minor variables such as, ink traps, small
    weight changes, join angle.  That way, when you make your on-press test with the
    real magilla, you will be able to see what effect any or all of these minor changes
    make in print.  You go from just knowing it is a bit off to having a clue how
    to fix it.

  body: "My main thought with newsprint & inkjet printer was that I could pump out
    proofs whenever I wanted.\r\n\r\nBut as has been suggested I\u2019m better off
    getting a proof into an actual print run. This has the added benefit of being
    able to see how the design will perform on heavier-inked and lighter-inked sheets.
    I\u2019m liking the sound of this method more and more.\r\n\r\nThank you all for
    your responses, they are quite helpful."
