body: "Teeline Fonts is proud to announce the the arrival of Ambicase Fatface.\r\n\r\nAmbicase
  Fatface takes an inventive approach to unicase font design, offering not \"either/or\",
  but rather \"both/and\". Each letter in Ambicase Fatface is a combination of its
  traditional upper- and lowercase forms, in an extra-bold, high-contrast style. Its
  hybrid forms are a bolder take on those of its 2010 sibling typeface, Ambicase Modern.
  \r\n\r\nAmbicase Fatface stands out as a carefully crafted experimental font: its
  eccentric forms do not hinder its readability. It is suitable for high-style display
  settings. \r\n\r\nAmbicase Fatface offers a large character set and extensive OpenType
  features. Most notably, in modern OpenType-aware applications, Ambicase Fatface
  can be set in swash mode, which features sophisticated decorative flourishes that
  differ depending on whether the letter is at the beginning, middle, or end of a
  word. \r\n\r\nAmbicase Fatface is available in two optical sizes: Regular and Poster.
  At very large sizes, the Poster cut, with its finer details, is recommended. An
  attractively-priced set of both cuts is available.\r\n\r\nAmbicase Fatface is available
  in .otf or .ttf OpenType formats for purchase and download at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/teeline/ambicase-fatface/|MyFonts]]
  and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/teeline_fonts/ambicase_fatface_ot_set/|FontShop]]
