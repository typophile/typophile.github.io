  I'm using HF&J Whitney and forgot that I wouldn't be able to embed the font. Does
  anyone know of a typeface that looks similar to Whitney and would be able to be
  embedded? The goal is to allow the client to make edits/updates from their end.
  This might be a tough one. Maybe the easiest solution would be to have them purchase
  a license to Whitney.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: Sure. They are both based on the same model, inspired by News and Trade Gothics.  But
    their finishes are very different.
