body: "We have to typeset a book where the designer specified the font Warnock Pro
  (light) for the text. The book has a bibliography, and of course, in a bibliography
  where there are multiple books written by a single author, the second, third, etc.
  entries start with a dash three ems long (a three-em-dash) instead of repeating
  the author\u2019s name.\r\n\r\nThere is no threeemdash in Warnock Pro (light). And
  the emdash itself has sidebearings, so setting three dashes in a row also doesn\u2019t
  work. Nor were multiple dashes kerned in the foundry font.\r\n\r\nOK, In FontLab
  5, I can make a threeemdash and a twoemdash for the font, so named, with no Unicode
  index (I take U2015 to be something else).\r\n\r\nThen go into the features file
  and add:\r\n\r\n sub emdash emdash emdash by threeemdash;\r\n sub emdash emdash
  by twoemdash;\r\n\r\nright after the f_j ligature.\r\n\r\nDid this, recompiled,
  and went to the Preview panel:\r\n\r\nEverything appears fine, all the other ligatures
  still work, and three emdashes in a row give the \u201Cthreeemdash\u201D character.\r\n\r\nBUT:
  the ligaturing doesn\u2019t work in InDesign, either through using the three em
  dashes via the Glyph pallet, or by typing three Alt_shift_hyphens (where there is
  no intervening code). I can add the glyph directly via the glyph pallet of course,
  but that is a lot of work \u2013 first erase the existing dashes, then insert the
  \u201Cthreemdash,\u201D for every such entry in the bibliography.\r\n\r\nThere should
  be a way to take the existing three emdashes in the supplied MS Word file & wind
  up with a threeemdash in the InDesign file, right?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure this
  is due to some complexities in Warnock Pro, since we\u2019ve gotten this ligaturing
  feature (multiple em dashes to a single long dash) to work in fonts we\u2019ve created
  from scratch.\r\n\r\nAnybody know what\u2019s going on?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "Charles,\r\n\r\nI don't have a whole lot of time to open up FontLab right
    now and try and come up with a more dependable answer, so here are just a couple
    of quick thoughts:\r\n\r\n(a) In my experience, problems such as these are often
    due to silly little mistakes that are difficult to catch exactly because they're
    so minor. For instance, have you checked that the new glyph you created has exatcly
    the same name as the one you're using in the ligature substitution code?\r\n\r\n(b)
    If you decide that you've already spent too much time trying to solve the problem
    in FontLab, why not just set the whole book in InDesign, then run find/change
    and have the program replace all occurrences of three consecutive dashes with
    your new m-dash? I imagine you've had this idea before -- what's stopping you
    from using it?\r\n\r\nErik"

  body: Instead of customizing the font, I believe it'd be easier and more reliable
    to accomplish the task with InDesign, like Erik suggested. <strong>Nested Styles</strong>
    might do the trick; just google for it or read InDesign's own Help.

  body: "One could also simply apply a little tracking to the emdashes to eliminate
    the thin sidebearings. You could even do a search and replace so as to apply the
    tracking just once per document.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: As Eric, Miguel and Thomas have pointed out, this is simple to address in
    InDesign. I have to use 3-em dashes all the time for setting bibliographies, so
    I've just built a character style that I load into each new book project (with
    negative tracking built into it). From there I quickly run a find/replace for
    every instance of 3 em-dashes and the sidebearings problem is solved, without
    having to muck with the font. (In particular I'm not big on de- and re-compiling
    a font with as many OT features built into it as Warnock; I'm just not experienced
    enough with FL to know for sure that I'm not simply introducing errors in the
    process).

  body: "Thanks to all. We decided to put in the new three-em-dash via search and
    replace in InDesign tagged text files, then bring them back into InDesign. When
    we later make the XML files, we'll change he threeemdash back to three em dashes.
    There were various reasons for not using the other approaches.\r\n\r\nJason, I
    share your instincts, but I had to go into this font anyway, because in the text,
    there were about 850 instances of special characters for what the publisher calls
    \"Sanskrit\" -- actually, Sanscrit as rendered with the Latin alphabet with diacritics
    -- all Unicode characters, but not included in most fonts.\r\n\r\nCharles"
