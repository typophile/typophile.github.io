body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently rounding up a finished font and I want
  to do it the right way. I read somewhere that it&#39;s very important to check the
  counterpunch &#40;make the font white on a black background and check the curves
  again&#41;. <BR>Who does this, how do you do that and how important is it? <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ve seen that with my font I need to do that. What&#39;s the most efficient
  way to do that? <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren

  body: That no one answers meens that the question in propably to easy. Lets&#39;s
    higher the diffuculty level. <BR>Do you do this in FOG or FL, or do you do this
    in Freehand or Illustrator? Do you then convert the font to paths and check it
    on the laserwriter, or can you just check it on screen. <BR> <BR>I need to correct
    some curves on my Nordic and don&#39;t know what is the easiest way to do that.
    I don&#39;t want to be inefficient. <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Rene

  body: I find a good way to check the quality of illustrations and logos, and this
    method probably works for type too, is to view it upsidedown or in a mirror, generally
    as a runout &#40;because then I can make pencil notes/adjustments to it&#41;.

  body: hhp, I&#39;ll try to find out where I read about it, but it makes sence. I
    checked Nordic in reverse and then you see the &#39;mistakes&#39; that you wouldn&#39;t
    see normally. Exactly like you would do with logos this also works with type.
    The same is if you turn a logo upside down.  <BR> <BR>I did it and some characters
    show mistakes that I hadn&#39;t seen before, also not in magnified printing. The
    eye is so used to reading black on white, that with white on black it sees the
    mistakes.  <BR> <BR>At least I know I&#39;m not the only one that never heard
    about it before. I&#39;ll see if I can get some more info if you are interested.

  body: You can do that easily in your font editor software. Just cut &#40;ctrl&#43;x&#41;
    the outer contour of your glyph and use the preview mode. The countershape will
    be filled in black. Make any necessary adjustments and paste the other contour
    back. <BR> <BR>But I think you should also take a look at other fonts. Look at
    their curves, the BCPs... see what works and what doesn&#39;t.

  body: James, I personally don&#39;t think that&#39;s completely true. A lot depends
    upon HOW you look at it and what you EXPECT to see. If you see it upsidedown &#40;think
    about a brochure laying on a table&#41;, you&#39;ll be surprised about how it
    will look then. Then it might not &#39;look good&#39; anymore. Invert a character
    and you&#39;ll have the same effect. A lot of mistakes you will not see in small
    sizes. But use it big and you can be shocked. <BR> <BR>You expect to see a perfect
    font, so automatically I think the brain &#39;corrects&#39; the mistakes. It&#39;s
    the same with grammar mistakes. Some you don&#39;t see because your brain correctes
    them, but they are there.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s in the nature of fonts that there
    are a lot of ways on how to apply them. If a font contains some very small curve-mistakes
    that would mean that you limit the user in their creative application of it, because
    they could not use it bigger. That a font might have been optimized for small
    sizes does not mean that you can&#39;t use it big, or inverted, or vertical, or
    only the counterpunches, etc. I for myself do that very often in my work.  <BR>
    <BR>So for specific applications I agree with Dukes statement, but it seem to
    me to be only half of the truth. In this statement I miss the &#39;but...&#39;.

  body: How you look at something and what you expect to see are all problems and
    experiences that make up the design process. My paraphrasing Duke here was in
    response to the original thrust of the thread that reversing your glyph would
    some how show you the countershape in a more critical environment. Personally
    I dont think any one enviroment is better than the other to evaluate a glyph shape,
    except for the environment that the type is designed to function in. <BR> <BR>I
    think a common mistake is evaluating a glyph at some monsterous size when the
    type face is suppose to function at 10-48 point. After drawing, proof at the size
    range of intended use. And then, if it looks good, it is good.

  body: Maybe I try to be too perfect, more than I should or have to be.  <BR>I think
    it&#39;s up to the designer how he want to proof his font. But if you can go the
    extra mile, why not?  <BR>Perhaps I judge the curve perfection only from my own
    point of view. I like to blow up, cut and past, abstract and invert fonts in my
    designs. It just looks cool. Perhaps out of my liking that I expect perfection,
    because at that level of closeup you see everything. You can even almost smell
    it. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>If pro&#39;s like Dwiggins and Briem do it, there must be
    something to it. I for myself feel it makes my curves even better. And then it
    makes me feel better. <BR> <BR>Ren

    pro&#39;s like Dwiggins and Briem do it, . . .</i> <BR> <BR>Ironically, it was
    just the opposite for WAD -- he drew large, but always proofed small. He would
    send off the drawings and wait a couple weeks for proofs of the actual type to
    come back so that he could finally judge his work at the size for which is was
    actually intended. As a shortcut, he would sometimes use a reducing glass &#40;opposite
    of a magnifying glass&#41; to try to get some impression of how the letters he
    was drawing would look in their final size.  <BR> <BR>But that was a different
    time and a different technology. The size that any given typeface gets used is
    no longer fixed. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    have merits. I agree with James that mainly what matters is the perceived result

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the &#39;in reverse&#39; test would tell you about a
    design intended for typical black on white use, other than that it probably isn&#39;t
    optimal for white on black. Luc&#40;as&#41; de Groot and Erik Spiekermann have
    both developed fonts that are specifically intended for white on black or backlit
    signage, and these designs are optimised for this purpose. In particular, if you
    have two signs side-by-side, one black on white and one white on black &#40;or
    similar high contrast colours&#41;, you need to make the letters in the white
    on black slightly heavier and sturdier in order for them to <i>look</i> the same
    weight as the black on white.

  body: In the development of ClearviewHwy our research showed that fonts for Negative
    Contrast applications &#40;Black letters on Light backgrounds&#41; had to be slightly
    heavier and a bit more tightly spaced than the those for Positive Contrast applications
    &#40;White letters on Dark backgrounds&#41; to appear the same. One of the problems
    with current regulatory signs in the US is that they use a set of fonts designed
    for Positive Contrast, in Negative Contrast applications, resulting in the type
    looking too light. <BR> <BR>I showed an example of this in my presentation at
    TypeCon. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll find the graphic and post it later.
