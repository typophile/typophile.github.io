  body: Stumped me so far... is it possible it&#39;s a 9? Where did the sample come
    from? <BR> <BR>&#40;You know, if all you&#39;re trying to do is torture us, you
    have to win a round of Type ID Pop Quiz first...!&#41;

  body: Hmm, I suppose it could be a 9... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what the source
    is. We&#39;re trying to match it for a customer of ours. This character is all
    that was sent to us, and the customer labelled the image as a &#39;square g&#39;.

    of the glyph shape. <BR> <BR>This is <a href="http://www.lineto.com/cont_cat_45.html"
    target="_blank"> similar to stuff</a> you might find at <a href="http://www.lineto.com/"
    target="_blank"> Lineto</a>,  <BR>tho their stuff is waaay better.

    something else</a> that&#39;s similar but not a match. The designer&#39;s site
    seems to be dead, though.
