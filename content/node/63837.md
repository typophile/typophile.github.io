body: Hello everyone, I've working on personal project. I'm attempting to create a
  logo for concept I have in mind. The idea is quite simple. You have talent in graphic
  design, copy writing, photography, art direction...etc. UC exist to help create
  a working live network for all creatives new and experienced. You create your network
  based on your desired goals. You create your own team of qualified professionals.
  The concept is in it's infant stage. Below is what I have in mind. The general idea
  is to create a sense of togetherness, workmanship, bonding, team. With that in mind,
  gloves off, bring it, but be constructive. Much appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unified_4706.jpg]

    lighter type.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the mark - I can see U in the ring-based
    marks, but I was also expecting to see C there as C's circular shape is begging
    to be utilized in the mark. Having said that, I really like the 1R/2R mark. It
    is very simple, nicely balanced and it would work great in a variety of color
    pairs."

    it'd be nice to see both C & U in the mark, and so I urge you to keep thinking
    about the mark and try to embed it with meaning; the typography selection can
    flow from there.. \r\n\r\nOutside of all this, I prefer the weight / font seen

    returned to the design before the ligature, and simply terminate the top of the
    f before it curves downward? If you really want a ligature there, you could also
    lift the ascenders one \"block\" up and link the crossbar of the f to the top

    I'm trying to understand if there's a system to using curved vs. straight inner

    are some straight ones sprinkled all over. I am guessing the straight corner is
    where two strokes meet (as opposed to a rounded corner where the stroke merely
    bends to change its path). But in this case E appears to consist of 4 strokes
    - L shaped one, two horizontals and one vertical... not sure if I am explaining

  body: Larger corner radius makes for more uniform (and predictable/boring) letter
    shapes. Or to put it differently - tighter corner radius creates visual contrast
    with the wider radius of U's bottom corners. FWIW I think such contrast is great
    because it adds character to the letters, so the top version for me.

  body: From a 10,000 ft. perspective (and I might be way off here) - I think the
    addition of "creative" makes logo look heavy and overdone. Just "unified" was
    excellent - it had a lot of character, and most importantly it was short and easy
    to digest visually. "Unified creative" on the other hand looks more like a typographic
    exercise rather than an identity.
