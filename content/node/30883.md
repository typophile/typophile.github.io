body: "This font started off as a few glyphs for a logo design. I thought it was interesting
  enough to flesh out the rest of the design in my spare time... but now I am to the
  point of pouring it into FontLab and starting the lighter and bolder weights. \r\n\r\nAnd
  I am beginning to wonder if it is worth all that work. I like a few of the glyphs
  a lot (like the \"g\"). But I am worried that this sort of simplified \"machined\"
  style has been done to death... \r\n\r\nDo you think Laconic is worth pursuing?
  Feel free to hit me hard. That will either convince me to turn my back on the font
  or finish it up out of pure stubbornness."

  body: 'Be stubborn, Robby, if that''s what it takes, but by all means pursue this
    project to whatever you believe is its logical end. With regard to pangs of "done
    to death" reluctance and such, the simplest answer may be, "So what?" Once finished,
    your take on this "style" (if indeed style it is) could well bridge a gap among
    similar but unequal niches, and could well be the typeface that designers point
    to and say, "There &mdash; now <em>that''s</em> the ticket!" In short, my humbly
    proffered advice is: carry on ... and please bring us back some updates as your
    project progresses.'

  body: "It looks to be a useful alternative to a face like Handel Gothic. Some of
    the upper case glyphs almost look slightly Art Deco-ish (A,B,R especially).\r\nOther
    observations/criticisms: Inconsistency in the counters of \"a\" and \"g\" compared
    to the rest of the set (i.e, they only have sharp corners), whereas the others
    tend to partially follow the outside contour (such as d, n and p). Watch the angle
    of glyphs like 7 and 4 since they do stand out from their lack of curves. They
    could be a bit steeper.\r\nOverall, a good start though :)\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: ' I like the way the laconic looks even if I have a few quibbles. That Cap
    R though... I think it''s worth thinking of a new one. So I would wait to go bold
    & light until you have resolved some issues with the basic design. I will provide
    more details later. Nice Icon BTW.'
