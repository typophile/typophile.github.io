    for the DS. Seriously, tho, I wonder if I could get some basic font creation software
    running on some open-source OS that\u2019s been ported to the DS. Fontforge isn\u2019t
    gonna happen, but I bet I get some simple bitmap font software running on there."

  body: "I got a sneak peak at some of the questions ahead of time (included at end
    of post).  I'm told that the drawing mode has several levels.  First you have
    to draw basic handwriting-like glyphs to make sure you know how to use the stylus
    .  Then the second level is drawing sans serifs, third level humanists, forth
    didots, fifth angle-weighted serifs, and the bonus round is fraktur.\r\n\r\nIt
    also has training modes for teaching sutterlin and charlamagne handwriting.  They
    plan on coming out with more editions for teaching other scripts, although when
    they do the Ge'ez version, they use a terrible font that looks like a Times being
    shoe-horned into it (or maybe it's the other way around) that's unreadable to
    everyone in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_typographic_minigames_4474.png]\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
