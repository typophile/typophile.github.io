  body: "Hi Premdeep,\r\n\r\nThis is almost certainly drawn by hand I'm afraid, children's
    textbooks often use skilled lettering artists to write ideal text for children
    to follow. This is to ensure steady quality and to make extra sure things like
    connections between letters are consistently correct.\r\n\r\nAlso, cursive writing
    systems tend to vary between contries. The standard letters used in the UK are
    not the same ones as in the US, not to mention Germany, Sweden or France. What
    system is used in Punjab I don't know. So when looking for a similar font, especially
    for educational purposes, make sure it's one that is \"correct\" for the educational
    setting it's designed for."
