body: Is there a specific reason, while testing kerning, that my typeface looks pretty
  decent at 12, 13, 15, 16 pts. and virtually all others, but looks absolutely terrible
  at 14 points ... in every program I use to test it? Currently I am using Microsoft
  Works' word processor, among others, for testing but it doesn't matter which one
  I use. I am confounded and at a loss - even when I alter pairs to compensate for
  the kerning disparity at 14 points, then it only looks correct at 14 points and
  no other sizes. Is it my computer or is there some obvious typographical rule I'm
  missing here?

  body: "Good question - actually, just on the screen. It's strange because I could
    have the word \"responsible,\" let's say, at 15 points and looking good. I change
    just the word to 13 points with the rest of the text staying at 15, and it still
    looks good. Change that same word to 14 points however, and not only does it then
    take on the characteristics of the famous \"HOLLYWOOD\" sign, the kerning looks
    like a parody. This is really just one of a million problems, but the most annoying.
    For example, when  at anything but 14 points, the lower-case \"s\" looks fine
    but at 14 points, it looks 85 percent as tall as the remaining lower-case letters.\r\n\r\nAre
    there any sure-fire programs to test these things on screen? Notepad doesn't apply
    kerning, nor does WordPad - at least not in my versions of them. I'm just hoping
    to find something a little reliable. One font I created looked good but when it
    got to the myfonts.com site its kerning was to typography was what the movie \"Airplane!\"
    was to the Oscars."

  body: For that matter, on occasion when I change the size of the text when testing,
    I'll even notice small variations in the kerning at different points, 12, 13,
    14, and so on. And not always between the same pairs. Sometimes the pair "hn"
    is in bed together at 14 points, a mile apart at 16 points, and lovers again at
    18 points. I'm far from being a kerning expert, but this doesn't add up mathematically,
    visually, or scientifically. The space should expand or decrease - seemingly -
    by some sort of ratio one way or the other in a consistent manner.

  body: This is probably a stupid question, but can hinting have such a dramatic effect
    on the kerning, especially when at different point sizes a pair can go from being
    way too close to what seems like miles away from each other?

  body: "I've had this problem periodically too. Sometimes it helps to change the
    size you are viewing it at. Not the point size, but hit command + or command -
    (in Adobe or Quark software - I don't know Microsoft Works).\r\n\r\nBut your printout
    should be the ultimate guide I think.\r\n\r\nDon't knock Airplane! It was way
    better than Titanic, Braveheart or Forrest Gump IMHO."

  body: Are you kidding? Nurse say she be back on the med-side. I LOVE Airplane, but
    unfortunately Oscar has different tastes. I have followed your advice regarding
    the change in viewing size, and it does make a difference for the good. However,
    my biggest difficulty is trying to figure out which view is the one most likely
    to be replicated to others, or on their screens. For example, will my font universally
    appear to others as it does to me on my screen at 13 points and 116 percent magnification?

  body: "I'd agree with Tiffany re hinting, also on-screen if you get four out of
    five sizes looking 'decent' I think you've got lucky. If 14pt is really important
    to you maybe scale the design, making the 13 the 14? Anyway visuals would help.\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"

  body: "\"if you get four out of five sizes looking \u2019decent\u2019 I think you\u2019ve
    got lucky.\"\r\n\r\nReally? If that's the case, is there a universal point-size
    most people attempt to make look good? Or does everyone just try to make all point
    sizes look as good as possible? \r\n\r\nI would love to provide visuals, but it's
    so erratic I don't think I could with any consistency..\r\n\r\nIf this helps:
    occasionally when I have the letters \"guild\" together and the kerning looks
    correct, I will do something like delete the letter \"i\" and the kerning between
    the g and u goes from correct to the letters practically being on top of each
    other. I must be missing some kind of setting or something, some output protocol
    I have either set or need to unset. Whatever the case, I can't imagine I'm having
    the same problems everyone's having or there'd be nothing but insane typographers
    everywhere ready to pull out their hair."
