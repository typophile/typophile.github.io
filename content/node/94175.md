  been using a specific font for my online published books on Amazon and the computer
  I designed the covers on is gone and with it went my fonts. I want to continue using
  the same font for my signature at the bottom of the cover but I cannot seem to find
  the font.\r\n\r\nI have been searching around and the font SAN MARCO is 99% identical
  to it, but the Capital Letters are the only thing that's different. I tried finding
  some variations but no luck.\r\n\r\nThe image website link  included is the picture
  of the font that I want to keep using and the font I want to know the name of :).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://infusionblue.com/misc/FontQuestion.png"
