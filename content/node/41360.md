    this is the wrongest possible place to ask something like that.\r\nLots of people
    around here (try to) make a living from designing type."

    \ I merely wanted to know if this was a free font for people to use, if it is
    something that has to be purchased, or if anyone knew of a similar font available.\r\n\r\nGuess
    I won't be coming to any of these forums anymore...I thought this was a friendly
    place...didn't know I'd be attacked for a simple question; you could have worded
    your response without being so rude.  Sorry I'm not font-smart like you but maybe
    that's a good thing because it seems to do something to one's ability to react
    kindly."

  body: Until I actually tried to make a font (when I was about 17) I thought it was
    ok to download fonts for free. Once I realised the tremendous amount of effort
    that it takes to perfect a single letter, I started buying fonts. To date, I've
    spent about $500 on MyFonts.com alone. Including ITC Giovanni. I see where you're
    coming from, but it's a great distance from anyone on this board.

    let alone \u2018attacking\u2019. It\u2019s rather your question that easily could
    be perceived as disrespectful here, though.\r\n\r\nYou might wanna check out Typophile\u2019s

  body: "I have to admit that I might have sounded rude to somebody so type-innocent.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like Janet\u2019s not gonna come back. I\u2019m sorry about that.\r\nI might have
    get carried away, due to the amount of posts asking for quality fonts for free.\r\n\r\nFor
    the record (and just in case Janet isn\u2019t gone):\r\nITC Giovanni is a typeface
    designed by Robert Slimbach, a type designer with a lot of reputation. I actually
    like it very much. Years of experience and a lot of work are necessary to produce
    a typeface like ITC Giovanni. That\u2019s why it has its price."
