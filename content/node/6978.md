  body: It&#39;s not your fault. This forum <i>always</i> gives me a server error
    when posting. I wonder whether a&#41; <i>anyone</i> can post <i>without</i> constantly
    getting this error and b&#41; whether this will ever be any different. <BR> <BR>Luckily,
    this doesn&#39;t have anything to say; postings don&#39;t get lost. After posting
    your message, just go back to the thread and reload it and you&#39;ll see your
    posting. <BR> <BR>jpg

  body: Typophile is by far the buggiest type forum I&#39;ve used. I personally don&#39;t
    mind the problems with making posts &#40;persistence is inherent to type design
    :-&#41; but when I never get emailed versions of other people&#39;s posts it&#39;s
    very disconcerting - sometimes I only discover an interesting post when somebody
    else quotes from it and I go fishing for the source. On the other hand, I guess
    the reason it&#39;s so frustrating is because Typophile has such great content!

  body: The forum software is buggy. Please be patient with it. I think of it as a
    daily reminder that I need more patience in my life. :^&#41;
