  I am working on. After multiple versions, we have now locked on the symbol but would
  like to take the typographical elements further. There are kerning issues but would
  really appreciate feedback on the letters together and general design. \r\n\r\nI
  ask that we not mention the client just for search engines.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid

  body: FWIW, the lowercase 'd' stands out as too bulky/heavy in its bottom-right
    corner. I realize that its composition is consistent with curved and straight
    elements from other letters, but visually there's just too much black in that
    particular part of the 'd'.

  body: "IMHO i think there is a problem with the 'e' the 'd' and the 'i'.\r\nthe
    width of the 'e' seems too large - and not the same style -  comparing other letter,
    i'm reffering to 'd' and 'g' \r\nfor the 'd' i don't know if it is too bold or
    some other letters like the 'c' who are too thin.  'Edg' seems to me the same
    boldness.\r\nand finally the 'i' is too square comaparing to other letters.\r\nbut
    that's just my 2 cents opinion, it is more visible in the big version of the typo,
    the small version, even if it the same,  looks great, as usual i would add. So
    maybe it's a problem of rasterisation."

    In the image below I have used the previously created 'd', I am still not sure
    if it works. The 'e' as you said was too large and is now more harmonious with
    the rest. I have zoomed in on the most changed letter forms as well below.\r\n\r\nHow
    do you guys feel about the update?\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is a disconnect
    created by the uppercase letters?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/de2_5918.png]"

  body: "Hello David,\r\n\r\nThe 'e' is a lot more better now. the first thing that
    came to me is that the top negative space inside of the 'e' is too small making
    the upper part of the  'e' bolder, i don't know if the problem come from the 'e'
    wich is too bold or the 'c' wich is too thin, because the 'e' looks okay with
    the width of the 'r' and 't'.\r\ni think i prefer the old 'c' but i'm not sure,
    and the old 'd' looked more stable. And still IMHO i think the thinner part of
    the 'r' and maybe also the 't' are too thin comparing to the thin part of the
    others caractders. But that's fine tuning and that's still my 2 cents advises,
    there are people here a lot more technical and better than me that could give
    you better advises. I just think that the thinnest part of the 'r,g,t' sould be
    equal to the thinnest part of the 'e' and 'c', but maybe it's just me. \"on ne
    m\xE9lange pas les go\xFBts et les couleurs\" like we said in french.\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    appreciated. The 'e' is certainly troublesome for me. I totally agree about how
    the 'r' and 't' should be more harmonious with the rest. \r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany,
    I really was curious as to how that would look. My original fear was that it may
    lose in character but the way it is turning out is certainly interesting. It is
    is really in how the 'e' is done that will make this work better but I haven't
    figured it out yet and had to add a different stroke weight. I think it looks
    a lot cleaner that said.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/de5_4817.png]"

  body: "good designer--i think i am. but a strong typographer? probably not so much.
    plus, i'm not so great with terminology (something i really need to fix). however,
    allow me a more intuitive response:\r\n\r\nmy feeling is that the logotype suffers
    from stressing the angle of each letter in too many directions.\r\n\r\nto me,
    the r & e seem as if they're stressed to the right. yet, the c and t lean towards
    the opposite direction. And finally, the counterspace on the d calls too much
    attention to itself for being too different.\r\n\r\nwhat bothers me about the
    letterforms sloping one way or the other is that having them do both is contrary
    to the name itself--a directed edge should have letterforms that all feel like
    they're going in the same direction.\r\n\r\n-evan\r\n\r\n"

    wondered if the uppercases letters being so angular created a disconnect and applied
    some curvature to them. I'm not too sure what I think about them yet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/de7_5263.png]"

  body: "I think you got it this time, look very nice. FWIW Have you tried a less
    rounded capital 'D' for starting, i like a lot the rounded capidal 'E', but not
    much the IMO 'over rounded' D. if i resume my opinion, the rounded 'E' fits better
    with the typo, the rounded 'D' look a bit strange, but it may be a good thing
    because it catch the eye.\r\n\r\nedit: the more i look a it the more i find the

  body: "If I wanted to play devil's advocate I'd ask: Think about *why* you make
    these letters by hand and don't use an existing font \u2013 and then try to give
    them a unique quality, a concept of your own, that can't be found in similar fonts
    out there. What's your vision, what's the \"feel\" you want this to have? That
    should make formal decisions like \"to round or not to round\" easier.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I think this has been improving quite rapidly. Here are some comments (take
    with salt, I'm not the most experienced type designer on the planet\u2026 :o)
    )\r\n\r\nI think the \"t\" is still falling to the left (although the shape of
    the \"c\" helps it) \u2013 its foot feels rather unstable. The \"g\" is somewhat
    off-balance too.\r\n\r\nLook at how you terminate strokes: \"r\", \"c\", \"t\",
    and \"g\" are all cut at different angles. Might be distracting.\r\n\r\nOh and,
    I think the dot on the \"i\" is too small, unless you're shooting for a deliberately
    postmodern look.\r\n\r\nThere are some curve details that look potentially problematic,
    but are hard to tell for sure without having a PDF: Things like the maybe slightly
    wonky stem-to-curve transition in the \"r\", or the join in the \"d\" that might
    want some thinning. \r\n\r\nAlso overall, look at your overshoots both on the
    x-line and the baseline (making the curved characters slightly reach over/under
    the lines: as it is now, the \"r\" looks shorter than the \"i\" at least to my
    eye \u2013 but it might just be a rasterization issue). "

    thank you for taking the time to look over this project. For the feel I am aiming
    for something that is modern yet with some character, interesting little visual
    twists here and there. I think all of your points are valid and thought provoking.
    I really appreciate you mentioning about the overshoots, something I have completely
    overlooked whilst working in a grid/geometric way. If increasing the size of 'i'
    dot will help readability I am definitely up for it.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a
    PDF of the latest 2 but as it is a work in progress I haven't cleaned up as much
    as I would like to as of yet. \r\n\r\n\u2022 [[http://drop.io/sm9nflw |PDF]]\r\n\r\nUp

    is that the G descender is quite long, and therefore grabs too much attention
    too this part of the wordmark, IMHO. Maybe look at Interstate's g or similar...
    Same goes for the ascender t... but maybe this is optical due to screen viewing.\r\n\r\nAlso
    I tend to think the capitals (D and E) are inconsistent in width in a uncomfortable
    way, aain IMHO.\r\n\r\nWith a grain of salt,\r\n\r\nMarco"

    and can definitely see what you mean. Making the 'g' descender shorter makes it
    all a bit tighter. I have also adjusted the 'D' and 'E' widths to make them more
    consistent. Below the before and after.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/de10_4692.png]\r\n\r\nAlex,
    thanks for the image and your thoughts. My favorite part seems to be what you

    to reflect on."

  body: "David, what I meant about the dot of the \"i\" is in this case simply a question
    of optical balance \u2013 it looks like it's the same width as the stem mathematically,
    so it looks smaller optically &ndash; which seems strange in an otherwise monoline
    treatment.\r\n\r\nI think this is much improved otherwise! The slight rounding
    seems quite nice.\r\nAgree the shorter descender is better; have you tried not
    making the \"t\" full-height? \r\nAnd I'm beginning to wonder about the \"e\",
    if it really needs *that* much contrast. I think the bolder parts of it might
    actually be a smidgeon too heavy, compared with other glyphs. You might try to
    balance it out a bit more\u2026 Try squinting: The \"e\"s jump out a bit now.
    Or maybe I need more coffee. :-)"

    top of the 't' could improve the composition as the shortening of the 'g' did
    it. The 't' maybe attract too much attention.\r\n"
