  body: I&#39;m pretty certain this is a custom logotype. I&#39;m sure the local font-hounds
    will let us know if I&#39;m wrong. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be willing to bet that it
    was strongly influenced by, if not derived directly from, Eric Gill&#39;s Joanna
    -- very popular with lifestyle magazines, especially after Martha picked it up
    &#40;although now MSL is no longer using Joanna&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: I sure couldn&#39;t find it. It looks so real, though. But, given that it
    doesn&#39;t appear anywhere else on the site or, it appears, anywhere else on
    the magazine cover, I&#39;m inclined to agree. Similar fonts include <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/jeunesse/">Jeunesse</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-stone-informal/">Stone
    Informal</a>.

  body: Custom job, and Kent is spot on about the Joanna influence. Rookledge&#39;s
    was no help, except in pointing out the similarities with Joanna in most of the
    characters. uc S is quite different, all lc characters except f and r can be customized
    quite easily starting from Joanna by chopping off serifs and flipping/mirroring
    parts. <BR> <BR>If you want a similar <i>feel</i> without having to go through
    the customizing, try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/rotis-semi-serif/"
    target="_blank"> Rotis Semiserif</a>.
