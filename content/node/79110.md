body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for two fonts used in logos. The first one
  comes from ROC La Voulte-Valence Rugby Union Club. Letters are quite \"square\",
  geometric ones with some \"holes\" on the upper part of the letters. As the hole
  structure is the same for a same letter, I imagine that it's specific to the font.\r\nThe
  second one is from DRU or Dannish Rugby Union Federation, it seems to be a condensed
  font.\r\nAs usual, images are attached.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n12HAL9000"
