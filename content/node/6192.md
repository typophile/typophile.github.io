body: Dear font lovers, <BR> <BR>hello I am TypeSmith and a German fontaddict,  <BR>I
  never saw a fonts &amp; typography chatroom so  <BR>I decided to create one for
  discussion about  <BR>font-design, typography and prepress stuff.  <BR> <BR>Would
  be glad to see somebody there ;-&#41;  <BR> <BR>You can go to the room by using
  your browser  <BR>via <A HREF="http://www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html</A>  <BR>or
  use an IRC client, host is &#34;webmaster.ca.us.webchat.org&#34;,  <BR>channel is
  &#34;#fonts&amp;typography&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Greetings from Germany  <BR>TypeSmith

  body: This is a great, TS. Thank you. <BR> <BR>Typophiles, please join us! I would
    suggest  <BR>using an IRC client rather than going through  <BR>the web/java door
    at  <BR><A HREF="http://www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html</A>.
    <BR>&#40;It&#39;s a bit buggy and slow.&#41; <BR> <BR>There are many free IRC
    clients for Mac and PC. <BR>Have a look at  <BR>http://www.versiontracker.com  <BR>or
    <BR><A HREF="http://www.windowstracker.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.windowstracker.com</A>
    <BR>or <BR><A HREF="http://www.download.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.download.com</A>
