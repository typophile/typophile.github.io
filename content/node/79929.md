  body: Hi Justin, thanks for the reply.  I am trying to duplicate this font as close
    as possible, but if I can get something close that is better than nothing!  The
    jagged edges may be a result of me blowing up the image to take the screen capture.  At
    normal size (10pt maybe) it is probably not even noticeable.

    an impact/thermal printer. These machines have their own proprietary typefaces
    which reside inside the hardware. So it\u2019s very unlikely you will be able
    to find an exact match. \r\nYou could search for bold monospaced fonts and for
    license plate fonts, which share some characteristics with the samples. You could
    also try to recreate it with Fontstruct (fontstruct.com)."
