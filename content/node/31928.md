  body: "The arrangement of the dates/names/tags is off. Dates are too tight to names
    compared to the names|tags spacing (partially due to the optical shift from thick
    to thin). Also, the date numbers and names are not optically aligned on the left;
    for example, look at the \"10\" above \"Julie.\" These two bits of text might
    be <em>metrically</em> aligned, but they look out of whack. To make them jive
    I think you need to hang the arm of the \"1\" ever so slightly to the left (same
    goes for the bottom 2 dates).\r\n\r\nAnd watch that accent over MEND\xC9Z.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments. What would you recommend on what I could do with
    the accent over MEND\xC9Z because if I increase the leading between the dates
    and the name then it wouldn't look as cohesive."

  body: "a few quick details: i agree with jason - dates are tight to names compared
    with other leading.\r\n\r\nalso: bullet between dates for michael gabellini is
    not centered as in all others.\r\n\r\nkerning in julie  b a rgman  is inconsistent
    - \r\n-other minor kerning tweaks needed in all names.\r\n\r\ncomma after cooper-hewitt
    on far left hits lower line - similar to accent problem in mendez. my self taught
    work around for those problems is to kern and letterspace like a madman until
    the offending commas or accents find comfortable homes.\r\n\r\nfun poster."

  body: Here's an updated version of the poster. I changed all the stuff that you
    guys mentioned and I also changed a couple of things.  Tell me what you guys think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dcnposter2_4679.jpg]

  body: "Those dates are still a problem, perhaps worse now as they're floating away
    from the names, mainly due to the fact that you're trying to make room for that
    accent in Rebeca's last name. I'd suggest bringing the size  of the dates down
    a bit so that the accent can fit under \"PM\" and then you can tighten up the
    leading between the dates & names.\r\n\r\nThe left-alignment of the dates & names
    still looks off as well. To totally solve this problem you might sheer the beaks
    off of the \"1\"s, although that's rather drastic.\r\n\r\nFinally, make sure that
    \"PM\" is top aligned with the numbers; at the moment they're super-scripted a
    bit too high for your purposes."
