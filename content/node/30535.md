  body: "This has a strong similarity to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/lucida-fax/\">Lucida
    Fax</a>, but looks like T was squooshed, and SC was simulated, if that's the font
    used. I looked at Lucida Bright, but the A shape was not as much like the posted
    sample. Basic Lucida has no middle serif on the E.\r\n\r\n[edit: Main reason for
    homing in on Lucida was the M. The 'crotch' doesn't reach the baseline, but comes
    closer than most other fonts with this sort of M.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
