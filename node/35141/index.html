<p>I often use FontExplorer to see all the characters in a font, but now it seems to be only showing a basic character set.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>On a related note, it seems that they added the option to sort by import date, which is a great idea, but also doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>

I have used Font Agent Pro (and a ton of others—I did my senior graphic design BFA <!-- raw HTML omitted -->project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on font managers and navigators, etc), but still prefer Font Explorer X (especially after considering FAP&rsquo;s $100 price tag). If you haven&rsquo;t used it yet, you should check it out.</p>
<p>kontrapunkt: Yes that would be nice. They do have an auto-ligatures checkbox, which is kinda a dumbed down version of what you suggested. Generally, if I&rsquo;m getting that detailed with character selection and OpenType composition, I&rsquo;d just as soon use InDesign anyway. For now I&rsquo;d be happy to get back the OpenType glyphs in the character map :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Miss Tiffany - hihi&hellip;. I did the same, i.e. pointed them towards this thread :-)</p>
<p>However, I do understand the difficulty of fixing the problem if you cannot reproduce it because you lack the fonts the problem occurs with.</p>
<p>I had a similar problem once: a font from Monotype was acting up in a software I was using, and the developers of this software asked me to send them the font so that they could check the problem. Since the license prohibited me to do so, I contacted Monotype, and they were quite nice, allowing me to do so in order to solve the problem. Turned out that this particular font had an entry in a table that was perfectly okay, but which the app could not handle. The app was fixed, and I was happy :-))</p>
<p>By the way, I would recommend using <a href="http://www.fontexplorerx-board.com">www.fontexplorerx-board.com</a> - great community, and especially the Mac perople are usually very helpful :-)</p>

<p>As far as the &ldquo;difficulty of fixing the problem if you cannot reproduce it because you lack the fonts the problem occurs with&rdquo;&hellip; it happens with ALL of my fonts. This leads me to believe very strongly that it has little to do with the fonts themselves and more to do with the app.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, that does not solve the problem. If I understood correctly, the problem runs like this:</p>
<p>FontExplorer X has a problem with a font. All other apps do not. That, naturally, does NOT mean that the problem is with FontExplorer X - it might nevertheless be the font - but it is likely. Nevertheless, since all other fonts work fine in FontExplorer X, how would these developers find out why their app has this problem with this particular font? Therefore, they need it to test it in order to find out what is REALLY going on. Sending them another font would only work if this font shows the exact same erroneous behaviour.</p>
<p>Believe me, have been developing software for ages. If you do not have the exact same settings, you cannot reproduce. It is a nightmare, and guessing is terror :-))</p>
<p>And I guess they ask for it because, the thing being a freeware, it is the user&rsquo;s job to provide the fonts they wish FontExplorer X to work with. I think it would be a little too much to ask Linotype to purchase every font out there which causes problems. Apart from that, I personally use a lot of free fonts they would probably have to search for ages to find them. :-))</p>
<p>Concerning other foundries, if you really want it to work, send them an email and ask them if they would agree to help Linotype fix the problem. Like I wrote before, Monotype was quite helpful concerning a similar problem once, I don&rsquo;t think any one would object.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh, I&rsquo;m definitely not encouraging sending a font that is not showing the problem. My point was only that since the problem seems to occur with EVERY font, it wouldn&rsquo;t really matter which font you sent. Thus, sending a Linotype font might ease some of the licensing worries that could arise otherwise.</p>
<p>I also agree that it would be too much to ask Linotype to buy every font which is having problems in FontExplorer X, because (in this case) that would be thousands of fonts!</p>
<p>I never got a response from my own bug report, but I might suggest to others that Zapfino would be a good font to send back to them. The bug causes FontExplorer X to only show 405 characters, but (as can be seen in the Mac character palette) Zapfino has more like 1,460.</p>
<p>On another note, is there anyone out there who is NOT seeing this bug?</p>

<p>But all this legal banter is besides the point anyway. Judging by the consistency of the problem across all fonts, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter which version of which font you are looking at.</p>
