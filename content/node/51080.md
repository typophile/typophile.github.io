body: In anyone's interested, Jonathan Hoefler's 'Requiem' is used in a new book,
  God's Crucible, by David Levering Lewis (Norton, 2008). I hadn't run across Requiem
  before except as an illustration in Bringhurst- I kept doing double-takes because
  it looks a lot like Centaur, and the italic looks a lot like Bembo's italic, Blado,
  but no, not Centaur, not Bembo, and the balance didn't indicate that someone had
  performed perverse operations on either of those fonts. I had to track it down.
  Requiem is very handsome, the italic especially so.

  body: I use Requiem a lot. I love the roman but am less wild about the italic. I
    find it a little spiky and condensed and not really of a piece with the roman,
    I'd rather have seen something more rounded and softer, more elegant.
