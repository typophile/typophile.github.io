  and one of the commenters suggested I would get more useful feedback here.\r\n\r\nI'm
  writing a Masters thesis on web typography and am creating a website as part of
  the project.\r\nIt's a work in progress, some sections need to be expanded, others
  edited down. I would appreciate any comments, criticisms or advice you might have.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.inkwell.ie/typography]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n[edit] I've corrected most, if not all of apocryphal apostrophes.\r\n\r\n[edit
  2] I should probably point out that this is a component of a taught Masters rather
  than a Research Masters. The website and paper only comprise 25% of the overall
  MA. \r\nI've  altered the opening paragraph to credit the Chinese and Koreans respectively.
  Thanks for all the comments so far."

    and discovered one factual error (Gutenberg didn't invent moveable type ... the
    Chinese did ... he reinvented it, or invented it for Latin languages) one sentence
    missing a verb, and a complete lack of apostrophes to indicate possessives. \r\n\r\nHaving
    the option to switch between serif and sans serif was nice, but the font size
    is bad, and in the sans the tracking is way too tight for the font. You could
    offer options for larger size, which is probably more important.\r\n\r\nDo proof-read
    your work. I find it unusual that a Master's project should be so lacking in basic
    English grammar. "

  body: "Hmm. I'm going to have to argue with your point on Gutenburg.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you said:\r\n<blockquote>I accept that the chinese had wooden blocks but in western
    culture Gutenberg is generally credited with the invention of the printing press
    so I'm inclined to let that stand. The point was to establish a timeline in the
    development of (latin) typography.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe printing press, sure.
    Gutenburg really helped standardise the process of printing press, ink, etc. but
    to say that he \"invented the first moveable type\" is overly simplistic. \r\n\r\nYou're
    working on an MA, so providing more information is a good thing! If I was writing
    a dissertation on the subject, I would probably say that he standardised the practice
    in the west, then include a footnote along the lines of \"technically moveable
    printing was first invented in China and there is some controversy over if Gutenburg
    was influenced by Chinese designs, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.\"
    Even if you don't plan to go into it, do explore it and give more context.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing you might want to consider. For a website dedicated to \"web typography\",
    and thus screen typography, your design speaks more to book design and feels old
    fashioned. I notice under \"Best Practices\" you talk extensively about Bringhurst
    and wonder if you're taking your design cues or direction from him. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"The
    book is aimed squarely at print typographers, devoting only two pages to the screen,
    nevertheless the fundamentals of typographic design are as valid for the web as
    for the printed page.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe fundamentals yes, but I wouldn't
    go so far as to say that one should design a webpage experience to replicate that
    of a book (Of course, I'm also one who believe's Bringhurst's book as more of
    guidelines than actual rules). Anyway, food for thought."

    body: "@ aaronbell\r\n\r\nThats a fair point re: Gutenberg, I might have to alter
      my *cough* entrenched position.  \r\n\r\nAs far as Bringhurst goes, the initial
      argument is that typography (in print) has had 550 years to evolve, culminating
      in (for many) Bringhurst's guidelines (I also treat them as such). I accept
      that the web is a different medium than the printed page, but my primary interest
      is in functional typography rather than aesthetic, expressive or deconstructed
      type."

    long before IIRC. The only reasons the Koreans used metal instead were the lack

  body: "Guttenberg did far more than standardize the process. He *invented* a process
    that was superior to anything before. Each element of the process, except for
    his invention of the the adjustable type mold, existed before. But he put them
    together: the wine press, oil-based ink, punch cutting and casting. He invented
    mass production printing, and changed the world. And they used his methods of
    the press and oil based ink in the far east as well, which shows its superiority.
    \r\n\r\nI believe the Koreans and Chinese used water-based inks, without a press.
    \r\n\r\nI'm no expert on this, but I believe those who are have no doubt of Guttenberg's
    importance. "

  body: "@inkwell Exactly, functional typography. I get that many feel Bringhurst's
    book is the pinnacle of all things, but functional typography on screen is actually
    different (in some ways) from functional typography in print. But there's room
    for differing opinions :)\r\n\r\n@Bill I'm not arguing that Gutenburg isn't important
    or that his work was eclipsed by the printers in the Far East, just that saying
    he \"invented the first moveable type\" is overly simplistic. As you said, the
    Korean and Chinese printers used water-based inks without a press, but it was
    still a technique capable of mass production. Disregarding their approach because
    Gutenburg's was superior is just as bad as saying Gutenburg's work wasn't that
    important!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as you said, folk were experimenting (in Europe)
    beforehand with all the different elements that Gutenburg brought together (except
    for the one). So yes, he did create something superior to all European methods,
    but part of inventing is also standardising, aka \"this press\" with \"this ink\"
    with \"this paper\" with \"these metal types\". Semantics, I know. \r\n\r\nFinally,
    yes Gutenburg's work was used in the Far East, but really only once the missionaries
    brought it over and said, \"this is what we use\". Ultimately it was superior
    to the existing systems, thus leading to the strength of the missionary presses
    in Japan and Korea, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the native process
    was still pretty dang impressive and was invented as early (I think) as 600AD
    for wood block and 1200AD for metal (according to some sources. Oldest extant
    metal type is 14th century). \r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a very roundabout way
    to say, yes, Gutenburg was important and his printing process changed the world,
    but that he didn't invent metal moveable type printing (since the first inventors
    of that were in Korea) as invent a <em>particular process</em> for metal moveable
    type printing, which then went on to change the world. For a MA, one should acknowledge
    that fact and not gloss over it. "
