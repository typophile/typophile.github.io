<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I understand that in order to fully enjoy OT characters that are beyond the default 256 I am used to, I need a program like In Design. I am curious does it have the same "save as" functions as PS, or do you have to import your layout back to PS to view things like results of .jpg compression choices?
What brought this on was after viewing Paul Hunt's new <strong><a target=_blank a href=http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html>ZANER SET</strong></a> and <strong><a target=_blank a href=http://p22.com/ihof/allyson.html>ALLYSON PRO</strong></a> fonts, I am burdened with an urgent feeling that I will soon need to start thinking up a series of excuses to explain to my wife why I need In Design. Not to mention the sale price of both sets. This will be one of my hardest sales ever, so any additional excuses, gladly accepted.

<div class=commentbody>If you plan on doing anything beyond image editing, Photoshop isn't the appropriate application to use. That should be the only excuse that you need, but I'm sure that people will be able to provide you with lots of good ones anyway. As for the first part of your question, I will leave that to someone that knows that they're talking about.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not quite sure what you're planning re:"results of jpeg compression"; using inDesign to create jpegs is kinda like banging on a screwdriver with a hammer to chisel out some wood; it works, but a chisel would do a much better job.
InDesign does have an export to jpeg function, but it's not very robust: I haven't found any way to make the export anything other than 72 dpi. If I need a bitmapped version of something I've done in InDy, I usually export it as a pdf, then I open the pdf with Photoshop. That way I get much more flexibility.
Illustrator does OT, and has stronger jpeg export functionality. (I think it's cheaper than InDy, too.) Depending on what you are intending to create, it might be something to look into.

<div class=commentbody>No. It must be CS or CS2. Same with Photoshop.
InDesign 2.0, however, will give you access to most OT features. And I have heard that some can even be reached in 1.5, but I've never tried that myself.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Upgrade Illustrator from 9 (it seems) to CS2 for $169 US. It's as OpenType savvy as InDesign.
Illustrator might be of much interest to you. The fonts you play with all live in an outline format; Illustrator is all about outlines, the same kind as those used in FontLab and Fontographer. So you might end up gaining a lot of functionality for a small investment.

<div class=commentbody>as said, photoshop is an image altering / creation software, NOT a software to set more than a few words in! it rasters type, and that is something you dont want if you want to print anything.
illustrator is to do create (i wrote "raster" here, which is totally wrong, as it is a vector-programm, didnt have much time when i posted) illustrations or documents with only one page.
indesign is to create documents with one or more pages, with great options and many time-saving things (like nested formats, etc..).
---
lets say it that way: setting text in photoshop is like reading disney-comics instead of a literature classic - it has a function, it works well, but its just not the same and shouldnt be used for the same things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>it all starts with a little casual font usage... and then you get a type addiction... and then you start feeling the need to access advanced typographic features... and all your $$$ starts going to designing software... and before you know it, you a full-fledged addict... it's a downward spiral. >^P
i was gifted my copy of Adobe CS by my mother, and i think she's got her money's worth out of it with all the posters, logos, programs and other paraphanelia i've designed for her. It's a great investment. You can always download trial versions of the software from Adobe.com and play with it for a month and see if it's something that you really need.</div>

Not entirely true. Photoshop 6/7 support a couple of OT features.
It is possible to know which features are supported on pre-CS versions by checking page 14 of Adobe's <a href=http://adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf>OT Guide</a> <em>(PDF file)</em>.</div>

Yes, InDesign 1.5 supported several OpenType layout features. Small caps, proportional oldstyle figures, and standard ligatures, IIRC. But ID 2 really added a lot of OT features.

Then maybe I could get a good friend from going on and on about the glories of his Mac every time we talk. (he went from Windows 98 to the current Mac OS, so you'd think he was talking about the benefits of eternal salvation)

That is very true. My employer is totally PC based, I work at home on a Mac. I can download InDesign files from work, edit them on them on my mac, then when I'm at work the next day I work on them using the PC. No problems at all.
