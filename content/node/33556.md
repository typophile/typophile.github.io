  has these W's with a little curly-cue in the middle.\r\n\r\nI feel like there are
  some very common fonts that have this characteristic, but I don't know what they
  are. Can somebody recommend some fonts with this little flourish?\r\n\r\nI'm using
  the font for some book captions.\r\n\r\nI feel like the captions for the New Yorker
  cartooons have these W's.....but they in fact don't.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nDavid"

    Premier Pro</a>. I bet that Minion Pro, Adobe Garamond Pro, and Adobe Jenson Pro
    would have it too, but I don't know offhand.

    for Caslon. You can see it in DTL Elzevir.

    to the 19th century French type called by that name, revived by Monotype, but
    to the 17th century types of Van Dijck that were used by the Dutch publishing
    house Elzevir and are the basis of DTL Elzevir. These types of are often cited
    as models for Caslon's work in the 18th century. They do bear a definite resemblence,
    though there are differences. "

    what you are saying is that the French movement against the Didone took up the
