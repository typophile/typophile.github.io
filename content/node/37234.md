body: "I have noticed that casual visitors to this site who come seeking the whereabouts
  of free fonts are generally rather coolly received. And, on occasions when the enquirer's
  na\xEFvet\xE9 and excessive fontlust is apparent, some forum members have felt compelled
  to lecture these cheapskates on the errors of their ways. It may well be that such
  exercises are gratifying for those delivering the lectures, but I really doubt they
  have much effect on the people receiving the lectures. On the other hand...\r\n\r\nA
  few days ago while web-browsing, I saw an ad for freefontlibrary.net, which promised
  thousands upon thousands of freebies. Idly curious, I clicked. The welcome page
  informed me that, in order to gain access to the goodies I sought, I would be obliged
  to complete a \"brief\" survey. After providing an email address (an old account
  I seldom use) and a lot of bogus personal information, I waded into what turned
  out to be page after page (I stopped counting after 25) of sign-up offers for \"free\"
  giveaways of one kind or another. The first eight pages or so, you could simply
  skip the offer to get to the next page; however, some pages which featured multiple
  offers would not let you advance until you clicked at least one of the offers. The
  bottom line is, after 20 minutes or so of furious clicking, I finally got to the
  end of the maze, only to find that the treasure trove was merely a laundry list
  of links to OTHER websites where free fonts could be found. I had to laugh...\r\n\r\nSo,
  I'm thinking, rather than lectures, maybe the next free-font seeker should be given
  a link...to freefontlibrary.net. Or not."

    and might have been one of those dropping in. A better approach than malicious
    intent on innocents (which can come back to bite you) would be a calm and rational
    explanation. \r\n\r\nIf people don't respond to logic, then at least you tried,
    but beyond that remember that because of Google, people will be seeing your response
    for a long time. Your patience could have the effect of convincing someone else
    down the road of respecting the rights of designers. It was someone like this
    who responded to something in a newsgroup that 'converted' me.\r\n\r\nOne Typophiler
    got a bad reputation for suggesting giving people corrupt fonts, and some people
    I know who spend a lot of money on fonts will never again buy any of his fonts
    because of it.\r\n\r\n"

    magazine about Free Fonts. Or even better, create an online repository of font
    production drawings, notes, videos of font designers at work, and so on, so that
    people might get it through their heads that good fonts take a tremendous amount
    of time and thought to produce. It seems like many people want free fonts not
    because they\u2019re on a tight budget, but because they\u2019re cheap and/or
    ignorant and see font designers as evil corporations gouging people for tiny computer
    programs. Enlightening them with a simple link is probably a good idea."
