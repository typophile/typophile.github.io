		<div class="commentbody">Interesting article, Steve! Although Nick's ideas are correct, I don't think that the typefaces he selected make a perfect group. But alot of that is subjective. Just because there would be almost no overlap between his list of the 22-must-have-fonts and mine (if I were to make a list) doesn't mean that his selection is incorrect in-and-of-itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aside from the article's being a tad stylistically and theoretically out of date, the one thing that requires re-evaluation is his comment about OpenType. Now, almost every major graphic application supports OpenType, or will support OpenType in the next version (Macromedia products being the exception). And, most type foundries seem committed to the idea of future OpenType development, including OpenType-only development, even if they aren't on that road yet. I think that it is same to bet that OpenType is the near and middle term future. In any event, OpenType isn't GX, and PostScript support will slowly soon disappear. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike, what is your definition of 80s crap?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i think rather than certain faces, it's more important to have certain types of faces. I mean the perfect set would be different for a newspaper than from a magazine or a design firm. But I think a solid set should include a serif family (or 2 or 3) with all the bells and whistles, an extensive sans family, and a handful of display faces incuding a formal script, a blackletter, and others as needed. I think Scala and Scala Sans are excelent choices and a solid foundation from which to build.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, that is a really great thread! I read it with great interest. I was also reading the thread as an artist in a garret using antiquated, but usable, hardware and software (ca 1998) to make creations, usually literary or literary-like. Especially fetching was Adam Twardoch's suggestion to get Corel Draw 9, with its &quot;incredible collection of fonts&quot;, including many from Bitstream and URW. It is available on eBay, currently, in a package called &quot;Essentials&quot;, though I'm not sure that includes all those fonts. Anyway, I'd love to hear any further recommendations or suggestions for the solo expressor of modest means.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Paul that it's a good idea to have a solid set of serif and sans serif typefaces in your collection. The typefaces you collect definitely depend on what you are using them for. In my collection, Goudy is a staple - it's a beautiful typeface. I also tend to like big families so I use Eurostile, Eras, Futura and Fenice quite regularly. This thread might work well as a question: &quot;If you were confined to a dessert island, which 5 fonts would you bring with you?&quot;</div>

<li>Frutiger preferable to Myriad, yes, but far too expensive. The full Myriad family was, at the time, way less expensive than any other of the full-family sans serif options. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. I recommended Times New Roman, as a better cut of Times than the default system font. About the Canon: my principle was to include examples of a full range of contemporary relevant genres for students to work with &ndash; Garamond, Times, and Century (aka Worldwide) were the classic serif faces. It would have been nice to also include a Didone, that is the biggest gap, I think, in the selection. Bear in mind that this is a working tools selection, not a type-history selection. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Zapfino and Hoefler Text: my principles state that in order not to confuse students, there should be a limited number of fonts, one example of each major genre, and not typefaces that are quite close. Snell is the fine classic script, and Adobe Garamond is the Garamond. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. You are agreeing with what I wrote: I did actually mention the 1920s hot-metal Baskerville revival, as well as the ITC. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. Mrs Eaves: as I said, Adobe Garamond was chosen as the classic small x-height face with all the bells and whistles.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. Do the math. The Myriad package was (at the time) by far the best deal for a full-family sans. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. The Myriad package was not MM &ndash; it was a collection of instances. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. Student discounts: things have changed, and much is negotiable. At the time, and working with FontShop Canada (no longer a franchise), there wasn't too much of a discount for colleges. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9. It's more important to give students the opportunity to work with fonts in a wide range of contemporary, relevant genres (including a few classic serifed faces), than it is to bore the pants off them with fancy theoretical distinctions between historical/national sub-genres (I've tried that, and it creates a very bad vibe &ndash; leave it for the MA!) BTW, I am no big fan of patriotism (I mentioned it somewhat tongue-in-cheek), but yes, supporting your local type designers is a worthy cause. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10. The Chalet styles: 60 does Helvetica/AG; 70 does Pump/Bauhaus; 80 does Avant Garde/Futura. In three weights, that's an excellent deal and a good way to cover the basics, the theme of this thread. Also, Chalet begs the Post-modern question of just how rational the modern movement was, and how much it was about cool, understated style: a good question to ask, especially in school. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11. Officina is more &quot;technical&quot; than Meta. Note letterforms of cap I and l, and the open fit. Perhaps DIN would be another choice to &quot;cover this base&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dan, you can pick away at the details of my selection, but I challenge you to produce your own &quot;Perfect Set&quot; under similar budgetary constraint.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding must-have fonts: the Berthold library, many of which were developed during the eighties and sold through Adobe in the 90's, are still widely used in a variety of compelling applications. These remarkably versatile gems include Berthold's Poppyl Pontifex, Waldbaum, Garamond, Concorde, Formata, City, Azkidenz Grotesk, and Baskerville Book. I would include all of these on a list of must-have typefaces, even with the plethora of outstanding faces that have been developed since. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other must-have faces would include Din, Meta, FF Bau, FF Unit, Copperplate Gothic, Sabon, Gil Sans, Jenson, Fairfield, Octavian, and Transit (originally developed for Berlin's public transportation system; too bad we don't see much of it in the U.S.). Remember, too, that Adobe's flagship fonts during the era of Multiple Master technology were Minion and Myriad, and these faces set the stage for further directions from a variety of talented sources. They are still widely used today, for good reason. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at the choices made by designers these days, I see a lot of intriguing new fonts from Dutch foundries (primarily used in Europe, unfortunately), and lots of well known faces who've survived the rigours of style, including Chapparal, Trade Gothic, Frutiger, and even Engravers. I know I'm omitting a thousand more, but these are being successfully applied in important work and deserve recognition, and inclusion, in a working library.</div>

It was a lot of work doing the research and writing and designing the article.
I stopped writing for magazines five years ago, and try and concentrate on making fonts these days.
I also had the advantage of advice from David Michaelides at FontShop Toronto, which is no more.
Now, I would have to pick someone else&rsquo;s brains.
But surely some educators somewhere have been tasked with doing something similar for their design schools?
How have they chosen the fonts their students get to set?</div>
