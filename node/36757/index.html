  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is the very first design for a business card for my friend who wants to start her own PR thing. I don&rsquo;t have other designs yet but I hope to develop different directions soon. There weren&rsquo;t very many specs to go from. She is elegant, likes pink and has a certain sophistication about her that I wanted to deliver through the design. I created the &ldquo;flourish&rdquo; out of an F and by adding to its curves. The little &ldquo;*&rdquo; is for the shine in the tagline. If just this design is too insufficient to critique, let me know.</p>
<p>I am also attaching my intention for the logo even though we never actually talked about creating one. She mostly wants a little BC for self promotion and I may not be the one doing the website.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Somehow this feels a little too &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; for a PR firm. From what I know about PR (admittedly not much), trust and stability might be as important to some clients as &ldquo;making a splash&rdquo; is for others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d increase the font size for contact info, put a physical address on the card, and balance your white space so it all feels grounded on the paper.</p>
<p>For a new business, I would even go so far as to list 2 or 3 of their key services on one side (this is especially helpful the morning after a party, when the recipient is sorting through 50 cards and trying to place names to faces).</p>
<p>I also worry that the light green and fuchsia might not have enough contrast for a logo with such thin lines.</p>
<p>As for the identity, the script of the logo and the italic of the name feel like they are coming from two aesthetic sensibilities which are just different enough to be disconcerting. Look at the details of the italic (ball terminals, strong contrast between vertical vs. horizontal strokes) and the script (more gradual changes in stroke width, no ball terminals, based on calligraphy).</p>
<p>I would think again about how you can convey elegance and sophistication. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean scripty fonts. You have other variables to speak with, including spacing, color choice, paper choice, etc.</p>
<p>hope that helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Like the simplicity in your stationary. I&rsquo;m not so sure you would want to list your services on a card, you may want to back it up with some other form of marketing. The color choice and font is very light and airy, which I like, but feel they don&rsquo;t come across as a PR company. I see more of a specialty boutique store. I think it&rsquo;s the color for that makes me feel that way. Anyway, great start.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree but disagree with Chris. I&rsquo;m in PR, and yes, the logo should reflect trust and professionalism, but with the changing industry, it also has to reflect change and modernity to show it is will be able to take their clients into the future.</p>
<p>That said, I like the logo. Maybe a little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too&lt;/em&lt; feminine for my tastes, but still reflects the trend in design: chic, clean, fun yet sophisticated. But I do agree with hola, I would have assumed it was a boutique store (as opposed to a boutique agency; which is what the company is, I&rsquo;m sure).</p>
<p>What would it look like without the asterisk?</p>
<p>Nice direction.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>after a long hiatus&hellip; (I was in a boat in the backwaters of kerala)!</p>
<p>I appreciate all the comments. I saw one too many badly done PR designs too and I wanted this one to own the personality of the person handing you the card. She happens to love* it. oops. but that can happen with bad designs too which I don&rsquo;t think this one is. but maybe not exactly cohesive enough (is what I pick up from chris&rsquo;s comments).</p>
<p>the comment about the boutique store is very intriguing to me because this PR firm/person could exude that sort of exclusive, dainty feel.</p>
<p>I am still itching to do a completely fresh, new, maybe even more modern (less flourishy) design.</p>
<p>I am also curious about sch2525&rsquo;s comments in terms of showing change and modernity and &ldquo;maybe a little too&hellip;&rdquo; ??? elaborate on that maybe?</p>
<p>did everyone have problems viewing the image?</p>
