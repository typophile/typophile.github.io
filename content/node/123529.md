    the custom tail on the |Q| and the striping were later additions?:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/hoefler-text/\r\n\r\nThe

    it is used on the website: http://www.arubanesque.ie/\r\nIn my opinion the striped

    They sell only the whole package, not individually.\r\n\r\nHow about the horizontal
    stripes? Other hoefler engraved fonts are in vertical stripes.\r\n\r\nThank you
    again."
