body: "Hey I am looking for a font similar to the one in the picture, or ways to recreate
  a similar feel to the typography. I need to make about 7 names for the doors inside
  of a day spa, the rooms are labeled \"Roma\" or \"Capri\" etc. So i need to recreate
  these names in the look of the attached picture. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMGP1081_4924.JPG]\r\n\r\nWe
  have a sign painter to paint the names on the door however he apparantly needs us
  to create the type exactly as he will paint them and can't for some reason do it
  himself.\r\n\r\nIf i can find a type face that matches close enough, or a good substitute
  with the same feel, that will be fine. Otherwise I might look into hiring a lettering
  artist to do it for me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Jesse"

    the same feel as a hand lettered sign. I Can't decide if i should just go with
    Quentin or find someone to hand letter these. Any sugguestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
