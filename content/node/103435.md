  body: "It looks like <strong>Columbus</strong> font of Solopedia catalog.\r\nAs
    you can find here:\r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-c.htm\r\nthere
    are many other digital versions of this font: \r\n<strong>Columbus</strong> (Sam
    Wang, Brendel/B&PGraphics), \r\n<strong>Wedgewood</strong> (Brendel), \r\n<strong>Deneane</strong>
    (FontBank), \r\n<strong>Cowan</strong> (Opti), \r\n<strong>C790 Deco</strong>
    (Softmaker), \r\n<strong>Tringle</strong> (WSI), \r\n<strong>Jazzy 50</strong>
    (Fantazia), \r\n<strong>Beaumarchais</strong> (Scriptorium)\r\n\r\n...and an interesting
    note:\r\n<blockquote>Tom Phinney is developing a high-quality version named Cristoforo.\r\nOriginal
    design is by Ihlenberg, 1892.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIs Tom Phinney actually completed
    his <strong>[[http://www.thomasphinney.com/2012/05/cristoforo-lives-kickstarter-ntern/|Cristoforo]]</strong>
    font?\r\nI really don't know..."
