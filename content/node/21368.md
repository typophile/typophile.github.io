body: "Some time ago I made a Open Type font family, regular, italic, bold and bold
  italic. When I export a pdf from InDesign CS2 everything looks ok on screen, but
  when I print the pdf with Acrobat 7.08 to our Canon C2620 color printer I get a
  strange mix-up of italic and regular glyphs. It\u2019s not in a random way, the
  scheme is as follows:\r\n<!--break--> \r\nFor Regular I get this:\r\nABCDEFGHIJK<em>LM</em>NOPQ<em>R</em>STUVWXYZ\r\n<em>abcde</em>fghij<em>klmno</em>pq<em>r</em>s<em>tu</em>vwxy<em>z</em>\r\n1234567890\r\n\r\nSame
  result with italic:\r\nABCDEFGHIJK<em>LM</em>NOPQ<em>R</em>STUVWXYZ\r\n<em>abcde</em>fghij<em>klmno</em>pq<em>r</em>s<em>tu</em>vwxy<em>z</em>\r\n1234567890\r\n\r\nBold
  behaves as it should:\r\n<strong>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</strong>\r\n<strong>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</strong>\r\n<strong>1234567890</strong>\r\n\r\nBold
  Italic behaves like regular and italic:\r\nABCDEFGHIJK<em>LM</em>NOPQ<em>R</em>STUVWXYZ\r\n<em>abcde</em>fghij<em>klmno</em>pq<em>r</em>s<em>tu</em>vwxy<em>z</em>\r\n1234567890\r\n\r\nOne
  of our printshops had similar results, that\u2019s the reason I jumped in and started
  to do some testing. I observed the following:\r\nPrinting the doc straight from
  Indesign CS2: OK, results as you should expect.\r\nExporting the doc from InDesign
  CS2 to pdf, and print that with Acrobat 7.08 to our Canon Color printer: NOT OK,
  see above.\r\nExporting the doc from InDesign CS2 to pdf, and print that with Acrobat
  7.08 to our Canon B/W non PS-printer: OK\r\nExporting a similar testdoc with InDesign
  CS and print that with Acrobat: OK\r\nDistilling the InDesing CS2 doc and print
  that with Acrobat: OK\r\nPrinting to pdf with Ghostscript: OK\r\n\r\n\r\nI changed
  the font subsetting from 100% to 0%, no effect. All four styles have unencoded glyphs
  in the private use area, but I can\u2019t see the relation with this strange behaviour.
  If I print to file with the canon printer and open the postscript dump, I can\u2019t
  see anything strange (I am not a PostScript expert however). This postscript file
  will distill perfectly. \r\nIt all hints at an encoding issue but I can\u2019t see
  why yet: the characters are in place, it\u2019s the glyphs that are mixed up. Maybe
  an internal naming issue? The fonts were originally created with Fontlab 4.6, generating
  again with Studio 5 gave the same results.\r\n\r\nAnybody any thoughts on this one?\r\n\r\nBest
  regards\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

  body: Paul, the issue sounds like one of encoding and Unicode indexing. First off,
    make sure that all of your glyphs have the correct Unicode index, and that all
    PUA-codepoint glyphs have the same index across all 4 fonts. Then, before generating,
    switch all fonts to Codepages view, and choose the MS Windows 1252 Western (ANSI)
    codepage. (After much trial-and-error, selecting this codepage results in correct
    behaviour on both Macs and Windows computers.)

  body: "Village:\r\nI usually apply Fontlab's default encoding, switching to ANSI
    doesn't change the erratic behaviour. regarding the use of PUA glyphs I believe
    there is some debate whether or not to apply them. In the original fonts, generated
    with FL 4.6 all PUA glyphs had PUA unicode entries, stripping them in Fontlab
    Studio 5 made no difference. Anyway, like I said, the characters are in place,
    there seems to be some strange interaction between the fontstyles. If there would
    be a real problem regarding encoding, it doesn't explain why all pdf files I create
    will print OK, <strong><em>except</em></strong> for the one I export with InDesign
    CS2. To add to the confusion, some further tests showed that point size also makes
    a difference in the kind of behaviour!\r\nTo be continued\r\nPaul "

    body: "Problem solved:\r\nIt appeared some of the fonts shared the same \"Type
      1 Unique ID number\". Those id's (remnants of the original Type 1 fonts) were
      originally unique for each font, but somehow they must have gotten mixed up
      in Fontlab, but how, I truly don't know. A slip of the (Wacom) pen I guess.\r\nAnyway,
      this is easy to fix, I just removed them (Adobe doesn't seem to use them as
      well). But why the described problem shows up under the given circumstances
      (exported CS2 pdf), that's what I'd like to know.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPaul"
