  body: Hello Zara, <BR>buon compleanno. And I would add nice to meet you, <BR>since
    I like birthdays but I don&#39;t know you. <BR>When I was living with my parents
    I had a small dog, <BR>Lachi, who, every now and again, used to meet up <BR>with
    a cute female dog called Zara on their pee strolls. <BR>Unfortunately I do not
    have any pics of her. <BR> <BR>Alessandro

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Thank you all so much! Though today was filled
    with some work and a little more work, it&#39;s a great start to what I know will
    be a very fine year.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>I&#39;m referring to a very depressing little story
    I once read about a boy named Zach who was always at the end of the line because
    of his &#39;Z&#39; name. Then all the children made fun of him and it was all
    very tragic. <BR> <BR>Yves, excellent use of those swashes! <BR> <BR>You all are
    so nice.

    long, for <i>whatever</i> you have planned in the recesses of your mind. Happy
