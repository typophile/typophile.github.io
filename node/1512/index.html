		<div class="commentbody">I agree. There are too many 'typed out' logos. I think <BR>there are a lot of designers out there who are too afraid of <BR>type design to try. I know a bunch who couldn't render a <BR>letter to save their lives. (Oh no, my beziers are lumpy!). <BR>Given, I am still trying to perfect this art, but I think there <BR>should be a little more emphasis on drawing type in design <BR>schools. I don't think people realize how powerfully unique <BR>letter forms establish identity. <BR> <BR>I always smile when people ask what font I used for a logo <BR>and I can say, 'No font, it's custom'. Sometimes even <BR>clients are impressed. If nothing else, it makes you feel <BR>macho in a nerdy designer kind of way. <BR> <BR>The worst are logos done in script fonts that are supposed <BR>to look handwritten. It's even worse when they repeat <BR>characters without using alternates or ligatures. I have a <BR>hard time justifying 'hand-written' fonts anyway, let alone <BR>in a logo. If you want to look like calligraphy, hire a <BR>calligrapher, or learn to draw yourself. <BR> <BR>It's true that it's easier to make deadlines and budgets <BR>with fonts, though. And we've all been there&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've been teaching a digital lettering course, and my students who all said they were &quot;very comfortable&quot; in Adobe Illustrator at the begininng of the course, are realizing that rendering original work with bezier tools is a lot different than what they are use to doing in AI.  <BR> <BR>bj states that every designer should know how to do this, and I agree, but not every design student has been taught how, so I wonder how many designers know how to handle a bezier.</div>
