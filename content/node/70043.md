  body: "It's not exactly the same, but <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/\">Avenir</a>
    is fairly close. The G, R and M are the same shapes, the S is about as closed,
    and even the Q is not too far off.\r\n\r\nI could not find an exact match.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I found similar results. That and Proxima Nova, but the forms remind me of
    an excercise of de-serifing Copperplate Gothic. I believe with some adjustments,
    it would get quite close.

  body: "That's a good observation Paul. The shapes are similar to CG, except that
    all the letters would have been compressed from the usual wide shapes, and the
    middle arm of the E is the same length as the others. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/\">Engraver's
    Gothic</a> and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/steelplate-gothic-rr/\">Steelplate
    Gothic</a> are two examples of these letterforms without serifs.\r\n\r\nLooking
    further, I see that <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/copperplate-gothic/\">Copperplate
    Gothic</a> comes in an assortment of widths and weights, so it could have been
    a reasonable starting point, as you suggested.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
