    about expressing one's Self). If Craft has gone down in value over the past century,
    it's because the Self has become too important. Let's right the balance by spending
    less on Art.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7615917.stm\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Hmmm...probably not much more than a hundred years ago the link between craft
    and the fine arts was taken for granted and one of them was both the same. The
    notion that somehow craft is separate, different or lacking in expression and
    that only art can express one''s self: that expression and craft are at odds,
    is pure ignorant folly. How quickly we forget our past and from what we have grown,
    if grown we have. The finest "artists" of the past whose work is regarded by many
    to be the bench mark of fine art were "mere craftsman" earning a living by working
    to commissions and serving the people. Their work did not lack craft, nor lack
    expression for the simple fact that one can not exist without the other. Craft
    is the crucial, the only link between intention and expression. Without craft
    there is only intention. Craft knowledge may be hard to define, but its not ineffable.'

    is somewhere between pure Craft and pure Art, but never at either extreme. Also,
    Craft is not devoid of expression; no human act is. The difference -as always-
    is Intent.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Craft is knowledge, and it has two heads. I would also ague that Intent is discovered
    through the process of making.\r\nThere is no difference between craft and intent
    for they are not separate concepts. No intent exists without craft for it is craft
    knowledge that gives birth to intent and vise versa. No doubt we could go on for
    ever about this, so I had better stop here or I will miss my deadline.\r\n\r\n"

    passion and emotional response to the world, the craft of designers produces their
    art.\r\n\r\n\"Art is a preishood which requires pure souls who belong to it entirely.\"
    - Paul Cezanne\r\n\r\n\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\" - Albert
    Einstein.\r\n\r\n\"The basic project of art is always to make the world whole
    and comprehensible, to restore it to us in all its glory and its occasional nastiness,
    not through argument but through feeling, and then to close the gap between you
    and everything that is not you, and in this way pass from feeling to meaning.
    It's not something that committees can do. It's not a task achieved by groups
    or by movements. It's done by individuals, each person mediating in some way between
    a sense of history and an experience of the world.\" - Robert Hughs, \"Shock of
    the New\", 1980\r\n\r\n\"Setting out to do what ultimately cannot be perfected
    is what makes art. The effort to do the impossible leads to creative work.\"\t
    - John Sloan\r\n\r\n \"The fact of the matter is that art is not a science and
    is not subject to any tangible law.\" - Otto Dix, 1958\r\n\r\n\"It is harder to
    see than it is to express. The whole of art rests in the artist's ability to see
    well into what is before him. Nothing will do but the most precise statement.
    He must not only bend technique to his will, but he must invent technique that
    will fit his need.\" - Robert Henri \"Art Spirit\"\r\n\r\n\"Content is not the
    same thing as subject matter: it is what the artist discovers in his subject.
    It is its content that makes any work of art dynamic. It is the content that the
    artist distills from life and which, through its influence on the spectator as
    she comprehends it, flows back into life\u2026\r\n\r\n\"The content of a work
    of art can only derive from definite, specific, particular experience. The artist
    cannot aim at such qualities directly. They will be achieved by the most faithfull
    insight into what it means to be a particular person in a particular situation.\"
    - John Berger \r\n\r\n\"It is empathy with the human condition and artistic freedom
    the ultimately produce the greatest work.\" - Justin Green\r\n\r\n\"When one follows
    nature, one obtains everything.\" - Auguste Rodin\r\n\r\n\"Genius  is only recognized
    in people who suceed.\" - William Merritt Chase\r\n\r\n\"Since bad art has a harmful
    effect on society it should never go unchallenged; but since the bad artist (like
    the good one) is an artist at all only because he claims he is, and has gotten
    at least one other person to believe him, how is he to be challenged? The only
    available rules are those of the gunfighter.\"  - John Gardner\r\n\r\n\"When a
    painter is unfaithful to his experience in order to meet the needs of a conventional
    demand of the period's taste, his talents are betrayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The function

    also inseparable from technique. Maybe I'm only engaging in semantic quibbling

  body: "Craft is skill, which implies both knowledge and ability. Specifically, it
    is the skill necessary to realise a thing (shape, give form, design, construct,
    make real). Art is that aspect of a thing that is extra-utile, i.e. that is not
    functional but is the focus of our aesthetic sense, our delight in beauty and
    ideas. Art as a class of object, refers to things whose character is wholly or
    almost wholly extra-utile. Such objects, like anything else we make, require craft
    to be effectively realised: it doesn't matter how clever the artist's idea or
    how beautiful his conception if he can't realise it. Just as art requires craft,
    everything that human beings consciously make is tinged with some degree of art,
    some extra-utile quality. Humans are aesthetic creatures, and when we make judgements
    about how to form a thing, no matter how dully functional the object in question,
    we include aesthetic criteria. Some objects leave little room for art, of course,
    because their function really does define their form, but seldom is an extra-utile
    component entirely absent.\r\n\r\nHrant's definitions of art and craft simply
    don't work. I am sympathetic to the criticism of individual expression contra
    making things for other people, but the use of 'art' and 'craft' to characterise
    the distinction doesn't make any sense and, worse, plays into an individualist
    and debased romantic view of art as 'self-expression' that is historically unjustifiable.
    As Bringhurst observed in a recent essay, if your self is the only thing your
    art expresses, it's not up to much as art. Art expresses the world and the experience
    of people living in the world, which is not merely individual experience. If art
    only expressed the individuality of the artist , why on earth would we -- would
    anyone -- consider it important or interesting?"
