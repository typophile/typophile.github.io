  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Having had the privilege of closely observing and analyzing the frenzied behavior of anonyrats, I predict a certain pattern of behavior: once the specimen becomes generally ostracized because of its rabid, irrational statements, it will quickly proceed to making seemingly rational statements (albeit rational only on a most simplistic, assumptive level), and manipulatively baiting people into resuming dialog. If you're tempted to defend yourself and your views, the specimen will quickly revert to gnawing mode. The specimen will do this until it is bored - there's nothing else to stop it. Furthermore, the specimen does this because anonymity causes the whole process to be an exercise in relieving frustration, as opposed to publicly working towards improvement (not even of the self). The more one humors the specimen through this cyclic process, the more frustration it relieves, so if you feel a humanitarian urge to help a psychologically unfit stranger, please do spend the time. <BR> <BR>But what if one wants it to stop? There is no magic bullet, so to speak, but ignoring the vermin often works wonderfully, with no active effort required, just some self-discipline. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Re. servicing members (sounds ruder than it is): <BR> <BR>In recent years, ATypI provided members with reasonably regular newsletters and a journal. Attendees of the Rome conference also received a complimentary copy of <i>Language Culture Type</i> (just one of many books that the association has published over the years). Our anonymous friend is correct to entail that such things entail some fixed and non-recoverable cost per member. He is incorrect to think that I am seriously hopeful of doubling the membership: I used the figures as an example of the economy of scale. I could easily have inverted the example and said that servicing half our membership would not be much cheaper than servicing the current total. Consider the newsletter or the journal for example: the only fixed cost is mailing, the production cost <i>per unit</i> goes down the more copies one produces. <BR> <BR>Now, as members have doubtless noted, it has been some time since any of us received a newsletter in the mail, and the last issue of journal was not printed but only available online via the member's section of the website. The simple fact is that ATypI cannot currently afford to service members with such printed material. It is an ineffiecient waste of scarce resources to print and mail a newsletter to all the members, when the news it contains is delivered in a more timely fashion via the Internet. Realising this, a small group of people within ATypI &ndash; among whom Mark Barratt deserves most thanks &ndash; put a huge effort into the new website. Members are only just beginning to realise and take advantage of the news and announcement sections of the website, and I have great hopes for it. <BR> <BR>Of course, there are bound to be some members who do not have regular Internet access, and I would like to have options for them to benefit from their membership, but given the limited resources priority must be given to the majority who can and do access the website. We are, if all goes well, at the beginning of a process of renewal, and it is going to take a while to get the association to where it should be, to where it can benefit all members equally and make serious contributions to the type industry as a whole.</div>

Everyone else seems to have understood this, and I've already explained to you once that it was not a proposal to double membership, any more than the same example citing a hypothetical 1500 members would be a proposal to triple membership. The amount of money one needs to spend on each member dimishes the more members one has: precise numbers are not important to understanding this basic concept, and I only picked 500 and one thousand as a simple example. At least, I thought it was simple. Perhaps I should have been more vague: if you have a big number of members, it will not cost much more per individual member if you have an even larger number. Understand the point now? <BR> <BR>I don't think for a minute that discounting fees for South Americans is going to double membership. I think some interesting and worthwhile people would join the association, who might not otherwise, and we would be helping our colleagues who are less fortunate than ourselves.

But everybody here would celebrate a $40 fee.  <BR>  <BR>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-  <BR>  <BR>One thing that I find very difficult of understand is why some ATypI members are more interested in the financial balances than in the possibility of new contribution and experiences from others countries.  <BR>  <BR>In the words of some contributors this debate is not only about rich and poor countries, it's about rich and poor designers.   <BR>So, why ATypI doesn't consider all we live in a unfair world and there are many good and talented designers that can't pay the annual ATypI fees?  <BR>  <BR>It's obvious that our arguments are not frecuent and this debate is a novelty for many persons. But we strongly consider that a global organization must take in consideration that not all designer are economically successful and this situation frecuently is not related with his capabilities.  <BR>  <BR>(Designers don't talk about his economic problems very frecuently. For many reasons they were educated to take part of the privileged part of society. It's funny but in Latin America many designer pretend to be successful artists being real blue collar workers&hellip;).  <BR>  <BR>When Mr. Porchez talks about the poor designers in the first world, I think two things:  <BR>  <BR>- Even the poor designers in Europe and EEUU have more oportunities and support than our &quot;rich&quot; designers (And I remember you that heres there are not such &quot;rich&quot; designers).  <BR>The person who talks about &quot;richs&quot; designers in Argentina is crazy or doesn't know this part of the world in any way.  <BR>  <BR>- And talking about poor designer living in the first world. Why ATypI doesn't have a fee politics for these persons?   <BR>  <BR>Now in Argentina there are a strong interest in type desgin. There are several causes for that, but at least 4 groups (&quot;Tipitos-Argentinos&quot;, &quot;Sud Tipos&quot;, &quot;SantoTipo&quot;, &quot;Letras Latinas&quot;, etc) are involved in font developing and learning to do it without almost any support, in difficult conditions and only based in his enthusiasm.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; One thing that I find very difficult of understand is why some ATypI members are more  <BR>&gt; interested in the financial balances than in the possibility of new contribution and  <BR>&gt; experiences from others countries.  <BR> <BR>I find this fairly shocking myself, Ramiro, but then a lot of people cant understand why I sometimes work for free by trying to organise meetings, writing documents etc.  <BR> <BR>I'm not about to change my vision of things and I don't think they are either. In the past, I've tried to convince people to come to meetings that would have been very good for them but they wanted to be paid and didn't show. If I live another 100 years I still won't understand their attitude and they, for their part, think I'm absolutely crazy and totally naive.  <BR> <BR>What can we do? Compromise? I'm not so sure that it's possible. <BR> <BR>I'll end with an anecdote I heard recently. Apparently, a few years back, Boris Yeltsin wanted to be paid for appearing in one of his own publicity campaigns. The PR people were all standing around in the snow in Red Square trying to explain to him by phone that he was actually paying them. In the end he refused to turn up and the PR crew went home. <BR> <BR>I reckon shooting yourself in the foot will be an Olympic sport soon enough. <BR> <BR>Matha. <BR> <BR>  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Latin Americans, perhaps they need to contact first their local Country delegate to see how they can built together something locally. The ATypI website say: <BR> <BR>ATypI Country Delegates produce an annual report on the state of type and typography in their country and facilitate communication and action with other ATypI members (*). They are currently: <BR> <BR>Argentina Ruben Fontana <BR>Brazil Claudio Rocha Franco <BR>Mexico Felix Beltran <BR> <BR>(*) I think, their role is not restricted to members only, locally. So, if they share information to give to ATypI members worldwide, they also have the function to do the reverse, bring locally ATypI Worldwide informations. This last way, is necessary open to non-members, to attrack them one day. <BR> <BR>If a group of 10 or more, rather than 2 or 3 guys here actually, built something locally with the approval of the country delegate, share info and so on, make a proposal to a lower fee for the complete group, its another possibility to find an good answer. <BR> <BR>I have a strange idea, but considering the urgent need, why not: What about if this group, share a same free email account, to read and post on the web, the ATypI list? <BR> <BR>Its better to think about new ideas ourself rather than complain to others who is always more easy. no? <BR> <BR>Last, but lot least, I thing that the language is a ALSO a strong problem to attrack more members than the just economical side. Its also another reason why their is more fluent English members than everything else.</div>

The &quot;two sides&quot; have been dueling intelligently and giving enlightening insights all around, and the protagonists involve people from all facets of type design, from Apple employees to Letterpress printers. I know why you left, but I think more perserverance and a better strategy could pay off for you; it's never too late to come back, and the list would be an even better place if you did. <BR> <BR>In comparison, the reaction to your <i>wonderful</i> question on the ATypI list concerning newspaper typography has been nothing short of pitiful, considering the extant potential. <BR> <BR>Trying to bring this back around: <BR>If we can get at least some of the experts on the ATypI list to share just a <i>trickle</i> of what they know, and actually reply to direct questions in some shape or form, you can be sure we would increase membership, since you need to be a member to ask something (as opposed to just listening to other people's questions). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
