  just one of several advancements Apple Inc. has planned for Safari 3.1, a small

  I'd post it for general edification/examination."

    Microsoft on this one. Laying down the gauntlet by sticking this functionality
    in a .X version browser with a minuscule market share isn\u2019t going to do much
    more than give people something to gripe about."

    is adhering to standards, I guess I can't complain.

  body: My own opinion is that this is good news. Apple can trial the feature and
    we'll see how iPhone and other Safari users react to the freeware fonts funneled
    down onto their favorite Web pages. Browsers on the side-lines can then decide
    if they want to jump on-board. Apple should get credit for having the balls to
    stick their head over the ramparts on this one.
