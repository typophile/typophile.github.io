    it on some share &amp; exchange Napster-like website, dude! A lot of hard work
    and personal money went indo recording that one, and nobody&#39;ll want to buy
    the CD if it&#39;s all over the web.  <BR>  <BR>So enjoy and be good!  <BR>  <BR>&#60;Removed
    the song as Adriano has downloaded his birthday present&#62;'

  body: No, I&#39;m not... I quit music 2 years ago, because I wanted to pursue a
    career in graphic/web design. Rehearsing 4 days a week wasn&#39;t helping much.

    never ever quit music! <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think of the song. And don&#39;t
    be affraid to be honest: my little brother for example doesn&#39;t like it one
    bit &#40;then again he&#39;s an orthodox hip hop/jazz head, so he generally doesn&#39;t
    like electric guitars ;&#41; &#41;.'

  body: You&#39;re very welcome, Adriano. I hope it will encourage you to pick up
    an instrument and start playing music again. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Joseph, I play drums
    and percussion. Manu, the man in the middle on the band picture, is the Brit-abroad
    who sings and writes the basic melodies and the lyrics. The band develops these
    into fully-fleshed songs. I sometimes sing backing vocals, but it&#39;s very hard
    to combine with drumming. &#39;:P <BR> <BR>Stephen, there is no such thing as
    &#34;Belgish&#34;, you daft hen! We talk French in Wallony, the southern part
    of Belgium and Flemish &#40;a sort of Dutch&#41; in Flanders. It would make sense
    if Manu was Belgian, but he&#39;s a Brit, so writing and singing in Flemish would
    be very awkward for him.
