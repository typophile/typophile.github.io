body: The date of this piece is 1856 and the round typeface stood out as being quite
  modern for the times. Just a curious typophile.

  body: "Hi Tommy\r\n\r\nI think you'll find that one (and maybe others like it) in
    Nicolette Gray's Nineteenth Century Ornamented Type Faces, although you might
    have to hit up your local library for a copy.\r\n\r\nOffhand I couldn't say which
    foundry was responsible; Caslon, Figgins, Thorne, Thorowgood, Stephenson Blake
    and others all showed 19th C display types that were ahead of their time.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're curious about it as a typo genre, there are excellent essays by Emily King
    (at typotheque) and Keith Tam (at typeculture) that go into a lot more detail
    about the 19th C.\r\n\r\n"
