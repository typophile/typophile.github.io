Christies is currently auctioning [[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?pos=2&intObjectID=5215215&sid=|this "1978" Sex Pistols flyer]]. But a closer look reveals what looks an awful lot like Comic Sans, released in 1994.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_01_5604.jpg]


So, is the flyer a fake? Or was Comic Sans drawn from an older face? And not to get all "Type I.D. Board" or anything, but do any other letters here seem out of place for 1978?

Though it looks exactly like Comic Sans, is it outside the realm of possibilities that the word "land" was snipped from from something Dave Gibbons lettered in the 70's? If another post-1978 typeface could be identified from the flyer, it'd be easier to call shenanigans. </div>

I would say so. The text is exactly like Comic Sans, even down to metrics--spacing and alignment! If it were taken from lettering, even by the source artist of Comic Sans, it's unlikely that any four letters would correspond exactly to how they ended up in the font.

Me, I'm going into typographically-correct document forgery. Beats looking for appearances of the word "land" in Gibbons' pre-1978 work:

When I was around ten, I was a serious University Roman geek. The E in Texas looks to me like it's University Roman regular of bold which has been emboldened by adding a stroke with square corners. The S in Sex Pistols looks like University Roman Bold but I think it's University Roman Regular slightly scaled with a fake bold effect . . . because it thickens in the wrong spots.</div>

It may have been a rush job, but Connare (i.e. the creator of Comic Sans) says, "I pretty much referenced the Watchman. And I was trying to copy the letter forms. And these are all hand drawn, so all the letters are different. I just drew them out very quickly." To me, that says "Comic Sans is based on the lettering in Watchmen." It's a valid statement, regardless of whether or not he did a good job at making a digital version of Gibbons' handwriting.

And maybe I'm just not a sufficiently discriminatory comic-book-lettering aficionado, but I looked at samples from Watchmen. I looked at Comic Sans. I believe the designer's story that he based Comic Sans on the lettering in Watchmen.

<em>Edit:</em> I think I may have misunderstood. It is absurd to say that the "LAND" in the flyer could be Dave Gibbons' lettering. It's a point-perfect specimen of Comic Sans. But I don't think it's absurd to say that Comic Sans is based on Dave Gibbons' lettering.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Natalie. When I saw the title of this post I was afraid I had to reevaluate my appreciation for the sex pistols (because I simply can't stand Comic Sans). Luckily for me the blame goes to some schmuck at Christies ;-)
I also like the idea of a 'Type scene investigation' force!
Interesting facts about copyright laws in Europe & the USA as well. Great read!</div>

I would have read this thread Thursday, but ironically I was busy that night looking at a (different) dubious document. Then travelling on the weekend. My case was much less interesting, though.

No, but don't tell me he doesn't sound like he's trying to validate his work citing it's inspiration. 

Right now, for me... sounds like that.

At least he's saying where he took his inspiration rather than just saying he created it from scratch or it being "completely original" or such. Whether or not the final piece is strong is irrelevant. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the record, Tom Orzechowski is my all time favorite comic book lettering artist. 

I first saw his work back in 1977 - in the official Star Wars comic book - incredible use of nibs, caught my eye even back then. And I saw his work few years back, updating and drawing text/sound FX for English translations of manga comics (strangely enough, it was a Manga version of Star Wars where he made these incredible SCREAMS for the Tie Fighters). 

His bio: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Orzechowski
and
his site: http://serifsup.com 

Just had to say so. (This is somewhat on topic, right?) ;)
