body: "I just wanted to say Thanks to all you wonderful people. I've found in the
  short time I've been here that most of you will go out of your way (I'd like to
  think atleast) to answers my distress calls for design help. Most of my queries
  aren't necessarily TYPE oriented and despite the fact that this is a Typographer's
  Forum I never get a cold shoulder or mean reply. I feel comfortable asking such
  questions because I trust in the sensibilties (and experiences) of our members.
  Not to mention there is a wonderful mixture of well established expert designers
  and novice youngblood designers to bounce these questions off of. I never feel like
  I have a stupid question. \r\n\r\nI subscribe to the RSS feed and get consistant
  updates thru out my busy workday. News, Informations, Questions on all manners of
  design and Answers, plus a pretty speedy reply network, make for a wonderfully rich
  web community and keeps me coming back.\r\n\r\nSo, Thanks again to all of you. Much
  love to the design community that is alive and thriving here at Typophile.com! "
