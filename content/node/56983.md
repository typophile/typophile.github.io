  body: "Thanks. A possibility. Thats probably a better choice than some of the othe
    cliche-ish ones I've looked at (Simran, Karolinger). Might give it a try. Was
    thinking of also trying something a bit more modern with it (at least as an option).
    \r\n\r\nAlso what do you think of Eidectic Serif or Sans. Maybe bold italic?"
