		<div class="commentbody"> Thanx! &#40;Hrant approval is gooood <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">&#41; <BR> <BR>Actually, the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height... So I guess I could make them cap height. Haven&#39;t tried. <BR>The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps... Hmmm. &#40;Starting to notice a pattern maybe...&#41; <BR> <BR>What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change, and if I took all in account, it would end up either like regular old-style or lining numerals. <BR> <BR>More questions: <BR> <BR>1. Being a newbie in &#40;serious&#41; type-design, I was wondering how many characters I should make, I don&#39;t really know how they all are supposed to look <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  <BR>&#40;I know the alphabet, of course, and the letters used in swedish, &aring;,&auml;,&ouml;, but I&#39;m having trouble with things like the difference in lenght between en dashes and em dashes and various other characters&#41; <BR>So, Is there any standard on how many &#40;and what&#41; characters there should be in a &#40;professional&#41; typeface. <BR> <BR>2. Distribution. <BR>I was thinking of making my bitmap faces &#40;designed mainly for flash use...&#41; available freely.  <BR>Is this a good/bad idea?  <BR>I invest quite alot of time in the tiny bitmapped stuff, but it feels like taking money for the typefaces wouldn&#39;t work. <BR>  <BR>Planned for this typeface for example is an extensive set of characters, small caps, different numeral sets and italics...oh yeah, and bitmap ornaments! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use?

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height <BR> <BR>! <BR>They look so much smaller... Maybe the tall &#34;Z&#34; next to the short zero exagerates the difference. OK, just ignore what I said.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#62; The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps. <BR> <BR>That makes sense, since the old-styles are x-height &#40;this time I actually measured to make sure...&#41;, and you want smallcaps to be a bit larger. <BR> <BR>&#62; What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t remember such suggestions... Anyway, here&#39;s the best on-line sample that I know of: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html</A> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve become conviced that -overall- the Carter numerals &#40;as I &#91;personally&#93; have now decided to call them&#41; offer the best balance in most situations. <BR> <BR>In your case I would make the &#34;x-height&#34; of the Carter numerals one pixel smaller than what you currently have for your linings, and extend the traditional old-style choices&#42; by two pixels. <BR> <BR>&#42; Except maybe make the &#34;2&#34; ascend - possibly by one pixel only. <BR> <BR>&#62;  I was wondering how many characters I should make <BR> <BR>Start with ASCII-8 &#40;for both platforms&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t really know how they all are supposed to look <BR> <BR>That&#39;s of course a major thing in type design. And sometimes designers will agree quite closely on things, other times not at all. And some designers worry a lot about the quality of such &#34;extra&#34; characters, while others just slap them together. <BR> <BR>Obviously, the more you look at precedents &#40;especially of course reputable ones&#41;, the better your results will be - as long as you don&#39;t &#42;mimic&#42; anybody - think things through yourself, and apply your conclusions. For example, the en/em issue raises all kinds of opposing opinions, so in that case it&#39;s better to simply look at what those characters are supposed to &#42;do&#42; in text, instead of copying some precedent. Another example: many people make the Florin upright, but I&#39;ve heard that the authentic form is slanted; this type of thing obviously deals with cultural preferences, so it&#39;s much harder to get right, as it can&#39;t really be &#34;thought through&#34; as much. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s this: <BR><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm</A> <BR> <BR>&#62; taking money for the typefaces wouldn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>For bitmap fonts it only works if you have a stellar reputation - like Matthew Bardram. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, consider doing this: <BR>Make outlines, and have two versions of the font: one bitmap-only, the other with both outlines and bitmaps. You give away the former, get people &#34;dependent&#34; on it, and sell the full version. <BR> <BR>&#62; Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? <BR> <BR>There are various schemes like that, but I think they&#39;re generally not flexible enough, and tend to be more complicated than people like. <BR> <BR>Consider this instead: <BR><A HREF="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082" TARGET="_top">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082</A> <BR> <BR>&#62; Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? <BR> <BR>Some of them are probably here listening, so wait and see. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I&#39;m fond of your small cap set. It&#39;s nice and  <BR>tight--the biggest requirement of bitmaps. <BR> <BR>Your new Ws are much nicer than the first round. I  <BR>guess the lesson is don&#39;t be afraid of varying  <BR>widths. <BR> <BR>Finally, regarding your distribution approach.  <BR>I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s not a bad idea to  <BR>distribute the bitmap for free and then sell the  <BR>outlines. You can see how it worked for Mr.  <BR>Gillespie with Mini 7. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I&#39;m also quite fond of the small cap set. It worked better than I thought it would.  <BR>As for the Ws, I guess I got blind working on them before. I took a needed vacation, and I saw what you were seeing when I came back. <BR> <BR>As for the distribution, I think it would be a financial hassle, as I would have to pay taxes, and probably register a company and so.  <BR>If I do not find a foundry that wants it, I&#39;m releasing it as some sort of share/freeware. <BR> <BR>Thanx. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hmmm. Would it be nice to have a &#34;Classified Ads&#34; section in Typophile? People could offer their fonts for licensing - it could even become an alternative to submitting to a font house: font houses would come here to see what&#39;s for &#34;sale&#34;. <BR> <BR>Or maybe make it a subsection of the Critique forum: finished faces could get an announcement there, citing the intentions of the designer. I think the News section wouldn&#39;t really work for this type of thing. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>
