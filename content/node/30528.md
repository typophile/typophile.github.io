body: "Maybe you've read my first attempt at dissecting a EULA, <a href=\"http://fontlab.wikidev.net/The_Case_for_a_User-Friendly_EULA\">The
  Case for User-friendly EULAs</a>. Within the article there is <a href=\"http://fontlab.wikidev.net/Image:Interrobang2-EULA-chart.gif\">a
  chart</a> which Nathan Matteson and myself compiled. This chart was the first stab*
  and I'd really like to, someday, make a more complete version. For today I'm only
  interested in foundries which do or do not allow modifications. If they do allow
  modification how do they define it? Also, if you can provide a link directly to
  their EULA or at least a PDF (please make note if it is a PDF). \r\n\r\nExample(s):\r\n\r\nFoundry:
  P22\r\nModifications: Not Allowed\r\n\r\nFoundry: Adobe\r\nModifications: Allowed\r\nStipulation:
  Format conversion only, Non-commercial or in-house only.\r\n\r\n\r\n*First stab
  meaning there are errors so please don't follow it like scripture."

    on the FontLab EULA wiki so that it can be more comprehensive and a greater resource
    when these types of questions come up.

    for Joe Smith\" vs \"Joeatino\" - most vendors who worry about modifications are
    concerned about trademark dilution. \r\n"

    you may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble,
    alter or otherwise copy the Emigre Font Software.</cite>\r\n\r\nNow... I can't
    find anything that explains \"as permitted herein\"\r\n\r\nand from the PDF embedding
    license:\r\n\r\n<cite>This PDF license is available as an extension to the Emigre
    Fonts User License Agreement. \r\n\r\nThe PDF license allows distribution of Non-Editable
    Adobe Acrobat PDF documents with embedded fonts, with the following restrictions.\r\n\r\n1.
    The fonts must be SUBSET embedded (only those characters necessary for displaying
    the document may be embedded.)\r\n\r\n2. The PDF must be set to View & Print only
    (the PDF must be set to no editing.)\r\n\r\nFor a flat annual fee of $150.00 a
    licensed user can distribute an unlimited number of subset embedded pdf files,
    with up to 30 fonts used, within a period of one year. For each additional font,
    add $5 per font annually.(I can't cite the text properly - this is the end of
    the text that should be italic)\r\n\r\nI ALWAYS set the pdf to no editing, but
    when a client wants a press-ready PDF instead of, say, a Quark or InDy file, am
    I not allowed to do this? Furthermore, was I to pay them $150 on top of the font
    purchase price just to make pdfs?\r\n\r\nThis is why I don't read EULAs. I need
    the font, I buy the font, I click \"I agree\" and use the font. Throw me in jail.\r\n\r\n"

    Embedding, that is another thread for another day. But yeah, pain!!!"
