They've requested something classy and sophisticated but fun. The name, as well as the spelling of &quot;enviting,&quot; is their idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Addison, <BR> <BR>just a couple of spontaneous thoughts as they come to my mind: <BR> <BR>1) First off, is that a comma after &quot;catering&quot;? <BR> <BR>2) Personally, I'm not too much fond of off the peg letters along curves (it's something different with handmade letters) and the combination with an cursive-all-caps-with-expert-T's setting doesn't tend to have me change my mind. To me, especially the cursives seem too much in combination with the arced text. The T's as such are nice. The curved text does look less serious than the straight one. <BR> <BR>3) I'm a bit undecided about whether the sharp, high-contrast letters (&quot;Enviting Events&quot;) go good together with the uniform stroke width and the sketchy freehand feeling of the graphic. They might, I think. I guess I'm just not too happy with the letters - for some reason I don't yet know how to elaborate. <BR> <BR>jpg</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That is a comma after catering, and I suppose I don't need it. Thanks. <BR> <BR>The serif type is Storm's Antique Moderne, and I was going for contrast between the type and the mark &ndash; kind of an eclectic feel I guess (and I'm a sucker for those swash Ts). Perhaps a type that relates better to the graphic will do the trick&hellip; I'll try some things. <BR> <BR>Sorry I didn't mention before &ndash; they specifically wanted to stay away from &quot;swirly and frilly.&quot; I've explored some options with the two Es and wasn't happy, but I'll revisit those sketches.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Addison <BR> <BR>I think the drawing is perfect and I would keep it. I also like the type choice (the second arrangement, not the type on a curve) and the contrast of styles between the casual graphic and the formal type. I think this works because the people planning these kind of events (your client's customers) are going for this combination of casual elegance in their parties. (Although that's just a guess because I'm definitely not part of that world.) <BR> <BR>Either element by itself would be either too casual or too formal, but combined they really play off each other nicely.  <BR> <BR>The graphic also has a soft, &quot;girly&quot; kind of vibe which I think would appeal to the kind of person planning parties like this. <BR> <BR>The frame around the outside of the whole thing &ndash; I don't see how it adds anything. I thought maybe that was to indicate the edge of a business card (is it?). <BR> <BR>The brackets around the second statement add an element of whimsy that I think works here. I might think about colors other than black and red. Maybe if the red wasn't so bright but more of a burgandy, which might look good paired with a gray (instead of the black). <BR> <BR>Overall I think you are very close to a really nice solution for your target audience. <BR> <BR>Rob <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Addison, If they want classy try getting them to make the logo printed as a pastel emboss or stamp. The contrast between the gloss of the logo and the  matte of the paper would be dramatic. Ask your local printer if he/she can get a sample to show your clients, also contact a paper company like Strathmore.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not that this matters, because you've eliminated the brackets, but I don't think they were necessary to begin with. The smaller size already implies the fact that it is describing what &quot;Enviting Events&quot; does. Brackets can be lovely and can also add to a design, but I think in this instance that were superfluous. <BR> <BR>Good choice on the type, and I also agree with Stephen's comments about needing a bolder version for smaller sizes. Your printer is going to have a coronary trying to get this type to print at small sizes. <BR> <BR>Does the apex on your envelope need further visual description?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, <BR> <BR>I do need to fine-tune the weights of the mark and the type &ndash; Eric Sans is very light, definitely a display type. I may use Gill Sans for the the &quot;Weddings, Catering &amp; Event Planning.&quot; Does anyone think it's possible to stroke the type to get the right weight and then finalize it in outlines? (Does that make sense?)  I'm hesitant to modify the points and curves &quot;manually&quot; because of the subtle tapers &ndash; I'm afraid of screwing it up. <BR> <BR>The apex of the envelope is pretty much a dot right now. Does it need some polishing? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison</div>
