body: "Many diacritic marks occupy two different unicode positions. One of which is
  the non-spacing, combining glyphs; the other being the standard spacing, non-combining
  glyphs. Are there reasons to include both in a font? If so, what are those reasons?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  when creating composite glyphs with diacritics, is it better to reference the combining
  glyphs as components or the non-combining equivalent glyphs? Or does it matter?\r\n\r\nAfter
  a few Google searches, I can't seem to find anything directly addressing these questions.
  The fonts I've opened in FontLab, are a bit inconsistent in all this."

  body: "Ha!!! Well, now I feel just a little more than bit stupid.\r\n\r\nThe answers
    given to my original question from a few months back went into greater depth than
    expected. It seems that I was unable to appreciate at the time that those replies
    also contained answers to future questions that I'd run into on the same subject.\r\n\r\nThanks.
    Now I'll crawl back into my hole. ;-)"
