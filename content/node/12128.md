body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Type and Lettering Styles]] : Blackletter</strong>\r\n\r\nTraditional
  style of type based on medieval scribal [[calligraphy]]. The earliest books printed
  with [[movable type]] were set in blackletter, including the famous bibles of [[Johannes
  Gutenberg]]. Blackletter type grew deep roots in the Germanic countries, developing
  its own vernacular form in [[fraktur]] type, a highly stylized script well-suited
  to economically setting German texts. It retained popularity as a decorative / ecumenical
  script in the English-speaking countries, predominantly as [[textura]] types, a
  role that survives today mostly in its traditional use on diplomas and wedding invitations.\r\n\r\nBlackletter
  type is strongly connected to [[German nationalism]], with Otto von Bismarck famously
  proclaiming, \"I do not read German books set in Latin letters.\" Latin typefaces
  did exist in Germany as \"[[Antiqua]]\" type and were used, but through the beginning
  of the 20th century played a subservient role to [[fraktur]]. Germans saw [[fraktur]]
  as an inherent part of their national identity. (cf. ref. Bain &amp; Shaw's <cite>Blackletter:
  Type and National Identity</cite>) \r\n\r\nYet an even \"greater\" German, J. W.
  Goethe, is reported to have disliked Fraktur, and wished that all his works would
  be printed in Antiqua. His mother implored him for decades in her letters not to
  allow his books to be set in foreign antiqua. She believed that, if people stopped
  reading \"German,\" they would soon stop speaking it. She feared that, if his books
  were printed in antiqua, only professors and intellectuals would know the works
  of Goethe, and his friend Schiller. Goethe and Schiller are still two of Germany's
  best-selling authors, almost 200 years past their deaths.\r\n\r\nDuring the rise
  of [[German nationalism]] that led to the Third Reich and World War II, blackletter
  type's totemic role as a token of national identity led to its adoption by the Nazis
  as part of their visual identity, particular in the form of the hybrid blackletter
  / latin forms known as [[Schaftstiefelgrotesk]], or \"jackboot Grotesques\". This
  has led some commentators to tie blackletter types inextricably to the Nazi party,
  arguing that this has made them somehow tainted, despite Hitler's 1941 proclamation
  banning [[fraktur]] (Schwabacher Gotisch, actually) as \"Judenlettern\", or \"Jewish
  type\". \"Grotesk/Grotesk\" actually denotes sans serif, in the same confusing sense
  that \"Gothic\" was misused by American foundries at the turn of the century. Hence
  a \"Schaftstiefelgrotesk\" denotes an angular sans design rather than a Blackletter,
  though their ducti mimic that of blackletter--and usually the less distinctly German
  <i>textura</i>, not true Fraktur.\r\n\r\nRegardless, at the end of World War II,
  Germans were interested more in repairing their shattered nation than untangling
  their complicated and now-tainted cultural heritage, and adopted the clean, modern
  types sweeping across the rest of Europe, and blackletter faded from view (interestingly,
  some forms of blackletter are still widely used in the Spanish-speaking nations,
  where they connote tradition and are valued for their interesting letterforms).
  Blackletter type has retained its connotation of medievalism, most ironically in
  use by heavy metal bands who use it for logos and album titles.\r\n\r\nOver the
  last 20 years, American and English designers have rediscovered a fascination with
  blackletter forms and produced experimental new interpretations such as [[Wexford
  Oakley]], [[Bastard]], [[Sabbath Black]], [[Gothic Gothic]] and [[Fakir]]. Meanwhile,
  a small number of German revivalists have started to go beyond the standard [[Fette
  Fraktur]] and [[Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch]] to revive a large number of traditional
  blackletter designs. Two of the most prominent of these are [[Dieter Steffmann]],
  a freeware designer, and [[Gerhard Helzel]], a German painter who is a sensitive
  and prolific revivalist of many of the early 20th century's greatest achievements
  in blackletter design. Many of the free downloads on the internet have inferior
  outline quality; these fonts should always be inspected careful before using them
  for a job which will be professionally output.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
