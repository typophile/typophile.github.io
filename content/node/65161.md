  so in love with this font - but I can't seem to find it anywhere!  Also the font
  for the other part of the logo would be fantastic as well (normal serif type) and
  the calligraphy type as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0301.jpg\r\nhttp://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0275.jpg"

    like the sample - which font comes with the Olicina Smooth?

    cap W is actually the swash M rotated 180 degrees with a bit of alteration. The
    other lower case are standard glyphs with ligatures activated.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    of the font. :)
