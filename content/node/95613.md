body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've been tasked with (re)designing a journal/magazine for Patent
  lawyers (the legal eagles who fight over copyright, trademarks, and intellectual
  properties). They're a fairly conservative bunch, but I think they could handle
  a contemporary makeover.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for suggestions for body copy and display
  faces. My initial thoughts are a slab perhaps Stag for headers, a neutral clean
  sans such as Whitney and a modern take on a serif for body - perhaps Chronicle.
  I'm aware these are all H&F fonts (but they are ones I'm well versed in using).
  The other school of thought is something a bit more retro a la Gotham or Neutraface,
  but to be honest I'm getting a little tired of those...\r\n\r\nSo can anyone suggest
  some alternatives? Bearing in mind as it's predominantly a journal there will be
  a lot of reading matter and not much imagery, so I need the fonts to vary and produce
  texture, but be complementary and not too edgy.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    think, setting the whole thing in a geometric typeface won\u2019t be readable
    enough. Better combine a serif for body text with something like Stag or Amplitude
    for headlines."

    the heading is going to be a slab, maybe something like FF Olson? But with a less
    hefty x-height.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Always depends on what typeface you combine the \u201Cold-fashioned\u201D
    fonts with. Stag seems anything but dusty to me. And in that regard, something
    retro like Neutraface is not the right direction to take either."

  body: "Equity looks nice, but for the price tag I'd need to use across multiple
    publications and I'm also wary of using a 'new' font. I do love amplitude and
    there's something a bit more fitting, so would think Farnham or Miller might work
    well as body and have a contemporary yet established feel - also a bit more sophisticated.
    They also work well alongside Stag.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has recommendations to alternatives
    feel free to add...\r\n\r\n"
