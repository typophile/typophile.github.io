  have seen these about a billion times- no make that a trillion times- but I just
  can't remember where I have seen them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/byrd_donald_blackjack_101b_5333.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xft1_4623.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  think 'blackjack' and 'XAVER' are the same... I think.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks guys for
  helping,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    Cover probably too, but this was done before digital type i presume, so there
    might be small differences to the various digitzed versions\u2026"

  body: Yeah I'm pretty sure it is pre-digital Compacta. There's only minor differences
    between the digitised Compacta and this sample. Blackjack... and Xaver... are
    the same face I'm sure.

  body: "> <em>Blackjack\u2026 and Xaver\u2026 are the same face I\u2019m sure.</em>\r\n\r\nNope,
    definitely not -- we're looking at two different faces here. Compacta, the face
    of the second sample, has a very recognisable <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.6757.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=blackjack+donald+byrd&sampleSize=60\">square
    structure</a>, while the <em>blackjack</em> face has unmistakably rounded tops
    (check the lc 'a' and 'c' for example).\r\n\r\nThe first one is pre-digital, so
    it could even be a different width of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=1&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=anzeigen&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=blackjack+donald+byrd\">Anzeigen
    Grotesk</a> that didn't end up being digitised. I don't think it's Helvetica Compressed
    as the ascenders extend higher and the typical awkward swoop at the top of the
    bowl of the lc 'a' is clearly different than your sample."

    Compacta, the face of the second sample, has a square structure, while the blackjack
    face has unmistakably rounded tops (check the lc \u2018a\u2019 for example.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right.  :^)\r\n\r\nThe descenders of j and y is also different but I just thought
    it might have been a characteristic of the \"pre-digital\" cut but I was wrong."

    turn your speaker up first)</a> \r\n\r\nWhen it was down to twelve on American
    Idol,  Elliot Yamin did a version of Moody's Mood for Love\" (done by K.P. with
    another personal favorite, Blossom Dearie singing a female response part), and
    did a very admirable job of it. It was a vocal transcription with words of a James
    Moody sax solo on a \"I'm In the Mood For Love\" recording that Eddie Jefferson
    made into lyrics. This was given the style name of \"vocalese\". Probably the
    best known in this category is Manhatten Transfer.\r\n\r\nBut in my mind the champs
    are a group from France in the '60s called the Swingle Singers. They did a bunch
    of Bach tunes with The Modern Jazz Quartet, some of which were quite complicated
    arrangements, that to this day still amaze me. Using mainly the syllables Dubba-dubba.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, one of my favorite lyrics in all music is from I'm in the Mood For Love:\r\n\r\n\"Funny
    Butt when you're with me, I'm in the mood for love.\"\r\n; )\r\nI also like the
    work of the A&M/CTI designers in the '70s that did things like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jobim_4244.jpg]\r\nAt
    that less jaded time, they were eye candy."
