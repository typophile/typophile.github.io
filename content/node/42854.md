    more with a restaurant than other businesses. Were I working on a restaurant I
    would check out every restaurant nearby and make sure that the type won\u2019t
    by confused with competitors. It\u2019s probably also good to make sure that the
    menu type does not clash with the food; I often eat at a place that serves a mix
    of flavorful American and French dishes and has a menu set in Helvetica, which
    just does not connect at all."

    A menu? \r\n\r\nJames has given you good advice, I'd just like to add if you are
    designing/working on the menu - find out what the age group will be frequenting
    the restaurant. Keep a style in mind for what their eyes can read...  Also, how
    is the lighting at the restaurant? Older folks need larger type... etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    if it's the right thing for a restaurant at all. Also blue is the most unappetizing
    color."

    are font snobs out there who will boycott your restaurant if you use Papyrus or
    similar. The font needs to be obscure and a bit quirky, and take more than 30
    seconds to be identified on the type ID board. '

  body: 'Do anything you want, but when it''s time to design the menus, remember a
    few things: restaurants often have very low and uneven lighting, and people of
    every age go out to eat. Use a clear, conventional typeface, at generous size
    (10-13 point), and take advantage of bold and italic for emphasis. Print it in
    dark ink on light paper (no brown kraft paper). Customers will appreciate it,
    and waiters will be happy they don''t have to read the whole menu to people. '

    If that's an oxymoron, there's some redundancy in your phrase :-)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    as a Typophile, the best menu I've ever come across was in 2005, Caffe Uno, an
    Italian restaurant in Norwich, England.\r\nWe're outside on the patio, under a
    tree in an old cobblestone market area (\"Tombland\"--not etymologically derived
    from graves, apparently) on a lovely summer evening, and the menu is tall and
    big, printed in letterpress Futura, on a laid card stock. Mmmmmm!"

  body: "Yes, \"clear, conventional\" could be redundant, but I want to emphasize
    the idea that everyone should be able to read it. You could indeed use Grotext,
    Sauna, Beaufort, Aichel, Mentor, Tyfa, Caliban, James Paul or any other legible
    face. \r\n\r\nLetterpress menus indeed sound sumptuous. Maybe the owner has a
    press in the basement. If I ever have a restaurant I'll do that. \r\n"

    snobs are generally considered a target audience. You'd lose, what, like two people?\r\n\r\nThat
    said, typeface choice is still important because of the subconscious connotations
    that different typefaces carry with them. When Michael Beirut was asked in an
    interview about campaign design whether the average person could appreciate that
    Gotham is a uniquely American typeface, he admitted that not many people would
    know that as a fact, but that the typeface still carries with it a strong American
    vernacular. Papyrus carries with it thoughts of The Crocodile Hunter."
