body: "My questions about Caslon the other night had me comparing various version
  of Caslon to one another, as well as to other fonts. I hadn't visited Mac Rhino
  (http://www.macrhino.com/) in a while, so I thought it might be time to look up
  a font that caught my eye earlier this year: Tarocco. \r\n\r\nI was impressed with
  the lovely .pdf specimen, and I determined that Tarocco's generous x-height and
  airy (but not disturbing) spacing would serve me well. I decided to throw Stefan
  Hattenbach a few bucks and purchased the font set. I must say, that .pdf really
  showcased the font beautifully. It was quite effective! Boy am I pleased. Seven
  weights, including sc/osf faces as well as some basic ligatuers. Although I would
  have liked a few more ligatures and some ornaments thrown in, I figured the former
  was due to the overall spirit of Swedish design (right?), and the latter due to
  keeping costs reasonable. What a great value. \r\n\r\nMy question is about the small
  caps: Maybe I should know better, but there is no Medium small caps set included.
  It's there for the Roman, however. I prefer to use the Medium for extended text
  work because (surprise, surprise!) it's a bit more meaty. I have to use the Roman
  small caps with the Medium. Is this a normal situation? The Roman (non-medium) small
  caps seem to work well with the Medium, but I still wanted to know whether this
  is usually a typographic no-no. Or is my eye still the best judge?   "

  body: "Christian,\r\n\r\nThanks for your positive thoughts of my typeface Tarocco.
    This was my first major text face and I've made more ligatures in my later ones
    (Delicato and Anziano). My intention was to keep it as an original text face for
    books. These usually don't carry small caps or italic ditto for other weights
    than the Roman/Regular one.\r\n\r\nGood news about Tarocco though. Very shortly
    I will have another \"set of Taroccos\" released at Psy/Ops Type Foundry. All
    weights will carry OSF (redesigned) and some newly designed ornaments.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    your question about mixing weights... I wouldn't say it's a total \"No No\", but
    maybe not \"normal procedure\". On the other hand if it looks good with your eyes.
    I would say it's ok. I'm sure there are many different perspectives on this one...
    let's see about other comments?"

  body: "Stefan,\r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you kindly for producing such a great typeface
    for the rest of us to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe Roman small caps seem to work fine with
    the Medium weight, although I realize it's meant for use with the Roman. And that's
    alright. The Roman looks great as well. I think the solution (to suit my particular
    tastes) would be to set the leading a little tighter when using the Roman. And
    I must admit, the finer details of the font show best when using the Roman, obviously.
    \   \r\n\r\nI look forward to your next set of Tarocco faces. Thanks again. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
