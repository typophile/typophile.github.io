body: Good day Typophiles, <BR> <BR>You may recognize pomegranate from a previous
  post. I&#39;m another designer working on the same identity.  We are trying to communicate
  the benefits of our integrated approach, in that the whole is greater then the sum
  of it&#39;s parts. I&#39;ve explored a variety of icons inherited from the pomegranate
  itself. We like the icon of the seed in that it&#39;s where everything starts, like
  an idea. Here is 1 approach I&#39;m considering for a signature and 2 versions of
  the wordmark. I&#39;m not sure about the ligature on the first kerned out version.
  What do you guys think? The 2 seeds represent our 2 core services and are positioned
  next to eachother to create an integration as well an invisible infinity symbol
  in the negative space. The pomegranate is a symbol of fertility and rebirth, so
  I thought infinity would be an appropriate symbol. Anyhow, this is my thought process,
  another perspective or any feedback would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img

  body: The seeds look remarkably close to the counterform of the clarendon a. As
    a bonus, &#34;pomegranate&#34; gives you two a&#39;s to work with... the counters
    could be slightly modified to look like the seeds &#40;a more subtle modification
    than the ligatures created in the previous example&#41;. Possibly the use of color
    could heighten this connection in certain applications.

    logo too,  and tried a few versions with a modified &#34;a&#34; unfortunately
    we still haven&#39;t hit the mark with it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26099.gif"

  body: Those versions are over the top. They just look like leaves. I perceive Angela&#39;s
    suggestion to be much more subtle. The letterform &#40;&#34;a&#34;&#41; would
    keep its outlining shape, while the counter assumes a seedlike shape. I can think
    of two ways to make the seed noticable <BR> <BR>1 exagerate the counter so its
    weight is uncomfortably thin, in contrast to the weight of the rest of the letter
    <BR> <BR>2 add a third color to the logotype within the counter, so the background
    color would be blue, gray, green or whatever, and the &#34;a&#34; counters/seeds
    would be red &#40;I guess it would really only be a two color logo, since the
    type is white/paper&#41; <BR> <BR>Another take on Hrant&#39;s idea would be to
    lose the link on the &#34;g&#34; and fill the lower loop, making it solid. This
    would make the top half of the &#34;g&#34; a pomegranate &#40;with a little tweaking&#41;
    and the lower half a shadow. I hope that suggestion doesn&#39;t break the rules
    of Typophile critique etiquette. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Yep, we agree that those versions just didn&#39;t work. I might try a few
    of your suggestions Scott, the second option sounds the most interesting. Thanks!
    <BR> <BR>Funny you should mention the stem over the &#34;o&#34; Hrant, as the
    original logo has that treatment. We felt this logo looked old and we had grown
    tired of the crown treatment but I&#39;m starting to wonder of it was just the
    typeface &#34;Rotis&#34; that we were tired of as it has received a lot of use
    over the last few years. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26192.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Maybe we should try the crown idea again with the new typeface?

    maybe a Preissig. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: It seems like you have, in the &#39;g&#39;, a ready-made &#34;fruit with leaf&#34;
    image that wouldn&#39;t take much effort to extend into an actual pomegranate
    &#40;with the spiky bit as the ear, the tail of the g becoming a leaf, etc.&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I agree that the new typeface is a serious improvement; the colour scheme
    is much stronger as well.
