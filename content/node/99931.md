body: Hi, we are currently working on a university project to create 2 contrasting
  ISTD journals on the typographic measurement debate, one issue being on points/picas
  and the other being on didots/ciceros. but issues must be contrasting and 32 pages
  long. However, we are struggling with research into this other than the obvious
  differences of size, nationality and age if anyone could point us in the right direction
  of some good articles discussions we would be very grateful.

  body: Sounds as useful and as topical as a debate contrasting the cubit/palm system
    to yards/feet/inches.

  body: My clients Brill, the academic publishers in the Netherlands, use didot points
    to spec type. The most obvious impact of this was that using integer type sizes
    and leading results in a different visual proportion of interline spacing than
    corresponding Anglo-American points. I made my initial specimens interpreting
    their spec using Anglo-American points, and found the interline spacing too tight,
    but when I revised it to use didot points (by redefining the point scale in InDesign
    preferences), the result was better.

  body: "The system proposed and introduced by Berthold (in the seventies, I think),
    and used by them for years until the demise of their photo-setting equipment business,
    was the most practical - based on SI-units: millimeters! \r\n\r\nToo bad it never
    got to DIN-status.\r\n\r\nAddendum: Or maybe it did. This article is not clear
    on this:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_typographic_units\r\nInteresting
    that Otl Aicher was involved.\r\n\r\nAnother addendum: Discovered that the Japanese
    Q stands for quarter millimeter. Smart! \r\nhttp://www.iol.ie/~sob/tm/index.xhtml\r\n\r\nQuestion
    that remains: did the Japanese go metric before the Germans?"

  body: A base 10 system is grand for measuring things, but a base 12 system makes
    much more sense for developing proportional relationships. Seriously, a system
    that cannot express divisions by thirds except as repeating decimals is severely
    hampered in terms of proportional relationships.
