  care who or what Punchcut is, or what its \u201Cgigs\u201D are? Here is what we
  should care about: \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Who are the real owners of Typophile?</li>\r\n\t<li>What
  are their names?</li>\r\n\t<li>How do we contact them?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nWhy
  are these facts not listed?"

    communication and education about typography. Your endless posts are quashing
    that dialogue and degrading the integrity of this site.

  body: "It's weird, but Joe is kind of right (about the missing details). I have
    utter respect for the work that Punchcut does in maintaining this resource - and
    for the community it fosters. It's truly invaluable to me. But the inner workings
    are unnecessarily mysterious - how does Typophile get funded? Can we really become
    members? I'd be happy to get a heart (or blood drop) - but how? Can I send Typophile
    money to keep it rolling?\r\n\r\nFor me, it's less about accountability than it
    is about ensuring continuity; see Zeldman's latest piece about the [[http://www.zeldman.com/2010/01/21/posthumous-hosting-and-digital-culture/
    | loss of content]] upon the loss of life.\r\n\r\nNow, back to my ampersand."

  body: "Typophile is funded through the generosity of community donations and through
    sponsorships. These sponsorships come in the form of banner advertising (as seen
    on the right of every page), Featured Face sponsorships (showcasing typefaces
    from various foundries and designers), and Typophile Film Festival sponsorships.\r\n\r\nOnce
    upon a time, Typophile had a membership model in which we offered various levels
    of memberships at set costs. During this time we offered goody bags and gifts
    to paying members and even restricted access to particular forums for our \"Uppercase\"
    users. As the Typophile community grew into the thousands (currently 50,000+),
    and as Punchcut grew as a company, we were no longer able to support the tasks
    necessary to keep this system running in the same manner. We eventually simplified
    the model and now offer \"badges\" that we hope the community will wear with pride
    if they have made donations.\r\n\r\nThere is a link in the nav at the top of the
    screen labeled \"Memberships\" (admittedly this language is out of date) where
    one can make donations to Typophile.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/membership\r\n\r\nIt
    has never been a secret that Typophile is run by Punchcut, and if anyone would
    like to learn more about who we are, you can click the link to our site in the
    footer (mentioned above) or read any of our bios in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typowiki\">TypoWiki</a>
    or individual user profiles, which have been public information since the conception
    of this site (which is turning 10 years old soon).\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, Joe, we
    have been through this before, on Typophile publicly and in private e-mails. If
    you would like to get to know us better, it might be helpful to show us your kinder
    side.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/moderators\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/typowiki\r\nhttp://www.punchcut.com"

  body: "Zara, you haven\u2019t solved the problem. All you\u2019ve done \u2013 yet
    again \u2013\_is bury an incomplete explanation of the <em>ownership</em> and
    management of Typophile in a comment thread. Gosh, that\u2019ll be easy to find
    later, or in a crisis.\r\n\r\nSeriously: Why isn\u2019t there a nice big About
    link on every page that explains who owns and operates Typophile, who owns which
    content, where <em>exactly</em> to go with any concerns (including a generic address
    for any on-duty admin)?\r\n\r\nWhy is that so hard?"
