body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nA while ago a famous Argentine cartoonist had an ilness that
  paralized his arm and did not allow it to draw anymore. So a good illustrator and
  friend draw the comics from him and to keep his characteristic handwriting style
  which was a signature some designers converted his calligraphy to regular fonts.
  The Anarosa Font. Here is the link\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tipo.net.ar/custom.html\r\n\r\nDo
  you know what software could i use to convert the handwriting of an architect that
  i know to a digital font? Is there any info in the web about how to do it. Besides,
  one of the great technical challenges i guess is to make a digital font that reflects
  the different preasure strokes that a good handwriting style sometimes have.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any info and cheers,\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"

    fonts. If you want something really high-end contact Comicraft or Blambot.

    does some people use the Illustrator to draw the scanned font one by one?\r\n"

  body: I've built custom symbol fonts using Illustrator and Fontographer. Each icon
    was saved as an individual EPS and imported. Setting your compound paths correctly
    in Illustrator takes a little practice so they display correctly in Fontagrapher.
    The same process could certainly be used to create a handwritten font.
