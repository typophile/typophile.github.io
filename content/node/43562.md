  body: "It looks an awful lot like ITC Leawood, only with slightly lower contrast.
    It's as if somebody took a lighter weight of that typeface and added a stroke
    to the text outlines.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://store2.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-UK&nr=0&event=displayFontPackage&code=1069&newsample=of+Silicon+Valley&view=View\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it's some other Les Usherwood design I don't know so well. He did a lot
    of typefaces along that line....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"
