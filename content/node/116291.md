  the thread if there is one. Anyway, does anyone know if the 'Nova magazine' masthead
  or 'Very' logotype is a font or is it custom drawn?\r\n\r\nAs both logotypes were
  done by different studios at different times (Nova first) i am assuming it is a
  font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nova Magazine _ Big Active_5010.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Very_

    unsolved but "everybody" agreed on whatever they are, they both are deeply rooted
