body: A quick font I did last night.. <BR>I have an interview at an art school tomorrow,
  so I thought it might be nice to do a last minute font to show them.. <BR>It&#39;s
  the second &#39;font&#39; I&#39;ve ever done, so all comments are very welcome.
  <BR>&#40;Note the missing v, crappy w, m, t and z.. :-&#41; &#41; <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'It looks like the x-height is off between the top and bottom lines &#40;note
    the e, f, and h compared to the p and r&#41;. The J is hard to read, also.  Overall,
    it looks like a twist of computer age with something out of the 70&#39;s, which
    is quite nice. '

  body: 'Thanks for the comments.. <BR> <BR>John, I might do a more eccentric varation
    of the font. Actually I kinda like the slight quirkiness of it at the moment..
    Don&#39;t want to overdo it. <BR> <BR>The interview went well, and I&#39;ve been
    invited to the entrance exams.. Which is good! Wish me luck <BR> <BR>I showed
    a bit of an updated version of the font with some very small alterations such
    as the x-height adjustments for the e, f and h. <BR> <BR>here it is: <BR><img

  body: I think the shifty baseline on the g and y don&#39;t help this.  <BR>Unless
    you do as John suggests and make it more eccentric. <BR> <BR>By the way, Moloko
    means milk, in Russian. Say it with me,  <BR>&#34;Vas moloko?&#34;

    up next thursday.. <BR> <BR>Moloko is milk in russian, yep! Actually most of the
    Nadsat street language in A Clockwork Orange is based on Russian words.. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m also working on another font at the moment.. <BR>But it&#39;s all
    over the place still.. All comments are welcome.. &#40;is it any good at all?
    i.e. worth showing at my interview?&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a screenshot: <BR>
