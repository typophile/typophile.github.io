body: "Hello. I was wondering if anyone could help me find a Chinese font, as well
  as Japanese, that could work well on promotional pieces such as a business card,
  letter head and so on. One that is legible. I realize that Japanese has about 3
  different alphabets and Chinese as well. I researched the subject but could only
  find out so much and was hoping someone could educate and inform me on this subject.
  I am not sure how to go about this problem and how to choose a typeface, since to
  me a lot of it looks interesting and I am intrigued by it (especially Japanese characters).
  Does anyone know about any good Japanese and Chinese Type firms?   \r\n\r\nAlso,
  are there any forums or blogs such as cardobserver.com, that display examples of
  business cards but in Asia or rather in the Chinese and Japanese languages? I need
  this to observe and study the layouts.\r\n\r\nI have researched Typophile and some
  of its posts regarding this subject but not all the answers I need are there.\r\n\r\nthank
  you,\r\nFroy"
