  body: "Sorry, obviously I hit the save button a bit to fast.\r\nHere is a picture
    of the 2013 edition. \r\nMade of 2000 and 13 keys.\r\nThe size is 70 x 100cm and
    reproduces the keys in original size.\r\nI hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nYou can back
    the project until October 31 on Kickstarter: \r\nhttp://kck.st/2000and13 (no shipping
    costs world wide)\r\n\r\nBeginning November prints are available from my Website:
    \r\nhttp://haraldgeisler.com (with shipping costs)\r\n\r\n<strong>Also I wanted
    to encourage you to share your typography inspired calendars, since this is obviously
    a topic that interests me.</strong>\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nHarald\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2013-Typographic-Wall-Calendar---by-Harald-Geisler---600px-wide_5773.jpg]"
