body: I&#39;ve heard about a very good essay about spacing by Andy Crewdson, where
  he talks about Walter Tracy methods, but it seems that it&#39;s no longer on the
  net. Does anybody know why?  I would like very much to read it.

  body: Andy closed his Lines &amp; Splines website in 2002 &#40;more <a href="http://typographi.com/000020.php">
    here</a> and <a href="http://typographi.com/000175.php"> here</a>&#41;. <BR> <BR>His
    article on spacing is, basically, a short version of Letters Of Credit&#39;s chapter
    10 &#40;&#34;Character Spacing&#34;, pages 70 to 80&#41;. Back then, Tracy&#39;s
    book was out of print. But it has been re-released recently, so I recommend you
    to get the book.
