body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m redesigning an identity for a european designer and
  manufacturer of memory products. &#40;<a href="http://www.ez-memory.com" target="_blank">http://www.ez-memory.com</a>&#41;  <BR>
  <BR>Well, the customer needs/wants a refreshment in both style and name so we&#39;ve
  changed it to Easymemory and added some dynamics and a fresh green color <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The font is Bliss regular... what do you think
  so far? <BR> <BR>Gracia! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33002.jpg"

  body: It&#39;s nice, though Ivan has a point. Perhaps it needs a simple mark to
    go with it? <BR> <BR>As it is now, the O is the focal point, obviously, but I&#39;m
    not sure why. Also, the S looks like it&#39;s about to tip over.

- body: Oooo.. what if.. you did something related to the synapses in the brain. The
    shape could be interesting, and the idea relates in both directions.. electronic
    hardware &#40;electronic impulses&#41; and memory.

  body: color combination is very nice. Reshaping &#34;R&#34; with larger lower bowl
    might be nice. Flattening out &#34;S&#34; at top and bottom and extending it may
    also be worth trying. <BR>top is same. bottom has changes &#40; these were done
    in Photoshop so they obviously need a bit on work&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33452.jpg"
