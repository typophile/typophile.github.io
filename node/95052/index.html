<p>The approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. My favorite rendering anywhere is with a minority of fonts under Windows DirectWrite ClearType. But to my eyes, the average font looks better in Apple&rsquo;s current Quartz rendering&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t know that it matters. In today&rsquo;s business section, the buzz is that the Apple is starting to spoil, which comes as no news to me. Why I think so is rather complex, but the point of the article is that investors are starting to get a little peeved with Apple&rsquo;s stinginess, because the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of the stock is basically all in the price per share, meaning Apple is a good investment as long as its market share and appeal are strong. Apple is worth a whole lot of dough, but the corporation doesn&rsquo;t like to share.</p>
<p>Or create American jobs. The big money is starting to see a less than rosy future…which, money being money and all, may well mean that Apple has peaked, and may be on the way down.</p>
<p>OS X becomes Classic Mac, or iPhone&rsquo;s become passé? I do not know: I do not have access to the big money crystal ball…yet.</p>
<p>Just kidding. I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s pertinent, but a lot of people who are banking on Apple&rsquo;s innovation &ldquo;edge&rdquo; are starting to get edgy themselves.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Old Nick, although I find analysis of Apple&rsquo;s stock price and its popularity both interesting, I don&rsquo;t get how they relate to the discussion at hand.</p>
<p>zeno333:</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s choice, ignoring built-in hints in favor of on-the-fly autohinting, seems to me to be based on the idea that people are going to have a wide variety of fonts, and wanting to make as many of them as possible look as good as possible.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s approach, relying on hinting in the font (though being less reliant in the newest rasterizers), seems to me to be based on the idea that it&rsquo;s important that the system fonts look as good as humanly possible, and that it be possible to make other fonts look really exceptional with some added work&hellip; even if that means that random other fonts are going to look worse.</p>
<p>Each company&rsquo;s choice on handling hinting plays fairly well in tandem with their choices on anti-aliasing and rendering. They have each made a host of different decisions, but all from a consistent philosophical place.</p>
<p>Because I am big on having a wide variety of fonts and such, I suppose I like Apple&rsquo;s approach a bit better than Microsoft&rsquo;s. Though I will admit the degree of fuzz on the anti-aliased text seems excessive, at least at old-fashioned resolutions. Once I have a 27+&quot; retina display on my desktop I won&rsquo;t care. Until then, I like Adobe&rsquo;s choices as far as anti-aliasing goes.</p>
