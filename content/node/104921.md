  secondary styles. now i am looking for hebrew type designs that create a set of
  styles (through structural change and within the same weight). i know about ismar
  david\u2019s david (and linotype\u2019s david hadash), henri friedlaender\u2019s
  (unreleased) attempt of hadassah cursive and ben nathan\u2019s days and nights.
  does one of you happen to know other examples / attempts that try to create a complementing
  style for highlighting within texts for continuous reading ?\r\nmany thanks in advance,
  nicole"

    styles for each weight. Narkisim has both left and right leaning obliques. \r\n\r\nBut
    maybe you mean by 'structural change' more than oblique versions, even though
    I'm pretty sure their outlines were adjusted by eye to look decent. "

  body: "hi mike, here are the examples i was talking about:\r\n\r\nhadassah cursive
    (henri friedlaender): it wasn\u2019t produced in the end because after the test
    that is shown in the picture below, henri friedlaender realized that there would
    need to be fundamental changes, such as a change of the whole rhythm. this would
    have been too much work and so, only the regular and the semibold were produced.

    for mentioning masterfont, i will have another look at their catalogue ! (but
    it is right that the masterfont\u2019s narkisim is masterfont\u2019s interpretation
    and not zvi narkis\u2019s narkisim?)\r\nyou were right that i am looking for more
    than oblique versions as i want to know how the inner structure of hebrew letters
    can change in a way that can be compared to the differences between a regular
    and a cursive style for the latin script (fluency, dynamic of strokes, change
    of terminals, etc.).\r\n\r\nthanks for your comments, nicole"

    cursive, called in Hebrew Ktav Yad (hand writing), which has its own tradition.
    There are many Hebrew fonts made in this style. \r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that
    Zvi Narkis had an agreement with Masterfont to publish his fonts. "

    distorted if viewed with Acrobat Reader (I think that is due to bad blue values

  body: "william,\r\nyes, i know about the hebrew cursive (what i didn\u2019t know
    was that it\u2019s called ktav yad \u2013 thanks ;-). \r\ni actually designed
    a text typeface that consists of three styles \u2013 an upright (hebrew square
    script), a cursive (like david\u2019s cursive) and a script (like the handwritten
    shapes) \u2013 for both latin and hebrew script.(http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2010/NicoleFally_MissInformed_specimen.pdf)\r\nso
    i am particularly looking for text types. i know only one example where the hebrew
    cursive was designed as a secondary style. it is from another reading student
    and was designed a couple of years ago. unfortunately, i don\u2019t know her name
    yet and only have this low quality photograph.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC03461_typophile_5680.jpg]\r\n\r\nyou
    write, the hebrew cursive has its own tradition. do you know where its shapes
    come from ? i could hardly find information about its origin. stephen lubell writes,
    \u2018The cursive script has been in daily use for several centuries amongst various
    Jewish populations and continues to be used in modern Israel. In contemporary
    Israeli display typography and lettering for advertisements, the cursive script
    has come to be used as an element of graphic differentiation, due to its distinctive
    forms and calligraphic feel.\u2019 (The Hebrew Typeface Designs of Zvi Narkis)\r\nbut
    that\u2019s more or less all i could find about it.\r\n\r\nmichel,\r\nthanks for
    the link and the example !\r\ni think, the rashi script is a possible variation.
    as far as i know, it was and is closely connected to religious usage and evokes
    religious associations. that\u2019s why i didn\u2019t consider it to be an option
    for the design of a style that is included in a text typeface that should be \u2018neutral\u2019.
    i might be wrong with that assumption !?\r\n\r\nmike,\r\nthanks ! \r\ni like these
    ligatures too and hadn\u2019t yet seen them.\r\n"

  body: Nicole, when I look at the various font shapes of the <a href="http://culmus.sourceforge.net/">Culmus
    Project</a>, I see nothing indeed that resembles Rashi (that is not even available
    as a postscript font in the <a href="http://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/fonts/">CTAN
    makor fonts directory</a>; all you can get there is the metafont sources).  Those
    shapes date from the 12th century. More recent shapes were first considered by
    Ben Nathan and discarded. They nevertheless belong to the history of Hebrew complementary
    typefaces.

    word, phrase or sentence in a page of regular may be instantly seen and stands
    out distinctly on the page.  This is not the same as 'emphasis' for which bold
    might do better.  Indeed the italic is often lighter on the page but is still
    very apparent.  \r\n\r\nThe image above with ktav yad amidst regular Hebrew text
    doesn't acheive this.\r\n\r\nI just looked at a few Hebrew novels and found on
