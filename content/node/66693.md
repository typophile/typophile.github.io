    You could combine <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/university-roman/regular/characters.html\">Letraset\u2019s
    University Roman</a>  (which has the swash alternates for r, g, y) and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/univrsty-roman/regular/characters.html\">Tilde\u2019s
    version</a> (which has a B that is closer to your sample), then lower the bars
    of A and E yourself, and you\u2019re almost there!\r\nF"
