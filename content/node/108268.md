  body: "This is a reverse weight font, i.e. the strokes are thicker at top & bottom
    than at the sides, with \"Detroit\" or \"Mansard\" serifs. A couple of fonts with
    a similar but wider design:\r\nRed Dog Saloon by Font Mesa:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/red-dog-saloon/\r\n57
    Rodeo by Baseline Fonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/57-rodeo/\r\nI
    trust that there is also an exact match, but I didn't come across it during my
    quick check.\r\nDon"

    digging though all the fonts called Tuscan, Western, cowboy etc.?\r\nDon"
