body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nSo I lost a font, and now I want to recreate the image I
  created with it, and I can't find it.\r\n\r\nI built a basic \"logo\" using some
  font that is remarkably similar to \"Grotesque\" and used it on a website.  Now
  that I want to use it again, BOTH remote .PSD files are corrupt AND my local .PSD
  is corrupt, so I can't access the file to determine what font it is.\r\n\r\nI have
  over 1500 fonts and I've spent about 2 hours looking through them and nothing fits.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached the ONLY sample text I have for it.  I know it's minimal, but maybe someone
  knows what it is.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n-rockerest\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nNotice
  the vertical bars on the parentheses.  I have not yet seen a font that has both
  these vertical bars (versus continuous curves) and the inward facing stroke ends
  on the parentheses (versus upwards or diagonal stroke ends)."

  body: "Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\nI made a huge mistake.  Those are brackets, not
    parentheses.  I can't believe I did that, and with that knowledge, I figured out
    that the bracket font is <a href=\"http://bayfonts.com/atilla-normal-p-170.html\">Atilla</a>,
    while the \"t\" font is Arial, as you said.\r\n\r\nI'm kicking myself hard about
    the bracket/parentheses thing.  Thanks again for your help.\r\n\r\n-rockerest"
