  do you buy it? :)\r\n\r\nI read that cotton paper may give clearer prints, however,
  finding a good source in London has not been easy for me. I feel that Epson charge
  far too much for their 100% cotton rag paper.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGlen"

  body: I agree cotton paper is expensive. I love the weight and feel of fax paper,
    its my favorite by far and is great for screen printing  :)
