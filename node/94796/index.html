  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We're looking to sub out the font in our academic legal journal, probably with a Caslon or Baskerville revival. 

Here's the main constraint: since we have to do all our typesetting in MS Word (don't ask--it can't be helped), we need something with immaculate kerning. Anything less, and our editors will end up spending hours fixing crashes. Right now we're using an old PS version of ITC New Baskerville. 

Thoughts?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Why Caslon or Baskerville?

What's the overall visual style of the journal?

How economical of space do you need the font to be?

What other technical typesetting requirements do you have?

BTW do you mean kerning or spacing? Because -at least in Word 2007- kerning is off by default.

Also Font Bureau will deliver TrueType versions if you want...

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant Sorry--I've been out of the game a while. I meant default metrics rather than kerning. Overall visual style of the journal is fairly conservative, and the biggest requirements are true SCs and superscripts. Economy isn't a huge deal, but Word doesn't offer great control over H&J settings, so I guess that would cut in favor of something narrower. 

We're leaning toward Caslon and Baskerville mostly out of a (probably misplaced) historical allusion. The school I'm at was founded by Ben Franklin, so a Baskerville or something colonial-era would be kind of neat. The journal itself was founded in the 1860s, but I'd rather stay away from higher-contrast modern types. I figured Baskerville might be a good compromise where that's concerned.  

@joshua In what way are Baskerville and Caslon opposites?

@William Right now Williams Caslon is at the top of our shortlist for Caslons. Thanks for the suggestion!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Giving the right historical flavor is certainly very relevant. And a Baskerville would actually be quite justified, since Franklin happened to be a big fan of it! And, as nice as Williams Caslon is, Franklin actually specifically preferred Baskerville over Caslon... See the text immediately following the second illustration here:
http://ilovetypography.com/2008/01/17/type-terms-transitional-type/

On other the other hand nobody could blame you for not being so historically literal; you could easily wade into conservative-but-not-Baskerville-or-Caslon territory, with something like FF Quadraat for example. It looks very old, but equally young at heart. Plus it has a very large number of components that cover a bewildering range of applications.

This is not the case. Caslon's letterforms, based on Dutch baroque models, and Baskerville's, based on the English roman style developed at the end of the 17th Century and beginning of the 18th by the writing masters John Seddon, John Ayres and George Shelley, follow completely different construction patterns and mimic the dynamics of different writing tools (broad nib and split nib, respectively).</div>

Fountain's Baskerville1757 is actually quite nice I think, but to me mostly because of the unapologetic "g" which might in fact be not too authentic... In any case it's certainly much more authentic than the ITC version with its inflated x-height.

* Avoid the free one, which is surely either a clone or just plain lousy.

BTW, the "a" is indeed an interesting "singularity" in Baskerville. I find it ugly, and I assume that's why so many revivals try to change it, but to me if it doesn't express some of that original ugliness, it's not a Baskerville.

		<div class="commentbody">Having spent a lot of time looking at actual Baskerville books, and even longer looking at the pen written models on which he based his types, I'm dissatisfied with all the digital revivals. I used Storm's display cut in the title slide for my ISType presentation, and I do think his italic is better than the Fountain one, but there's still some quality missing when one compares it to Baskerville's metal type.
