  by Christian Schwartz.\r\n\r\nSpecimen page: http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/NeueHaasGrotesk/\r\nMini-site:
  http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/\r\n\r\nLooks great, right? Well you better hope you
  work for an agency or something, because there's no 1-user license. The complete
  font of 22 styles starts at 2-5, for the low low price of $1232.  Even if you want
  to buy individual weights, you have to buy a 2-5 user license, so that's $80 each.\r\n\r\nCan
  somebody please explain to me why this update to Helvetica is worth that much? Especially
  when that $1200 could get me ...\r\n\r\nThis Air superfamily of 81 weights ($999):
  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/air/\r\nAll 64 weights of Gotham ($1196):
  http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008\r\nAll 32 weights
  of Knockout ($799): http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013\r\nALL
  FIVE FONT FAMILIES IN THIS LIST ($1277): http://www.myfonts.com/users/gikrs2alzi/albums/603578/\r\n\r\nI

    that it would seem more versatile than some of those other options. If you can
    use it in twice as many applications as you would use Knockout, then charging
    less than twice as much could be seen as a better deal.\r\n(There also might be
    differences in the EULA that should be part of the comparison.)\r\nBTW your myfonts
    gallery isn't set to be publicly viewable."

    with singles. \r\n\r\nAnd as you add more individual styles, the volume discounts
    start to kick in. One font starts at $40 for 1 computer. Three or more goes down
    to $35 each. I think there\u2019s at least one more tier. And the whole family
    works out to $28 per font (for a single user)."

  body: "If you update that cart with 1 computer selected, you'll be told: \r\n\r\nNeue
    Haas Grotesk is not available as a 1 computer license. Please select a different
    license.\r\n\r\nFontBureau confirmed that with me via Twitter, that their contract
    specifies no 1-user license.  I could handle $616 for one user, but forcing someone
    to pick the 2-5 user license is crazy.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess I don't see why these
    updates (or revivals, or whatever) are so expensive. Even if it took a ton of
    time to prepare it, you're still basing it off someone else's design that's readily
    available, even if the current versions are slightly imperfect. Plus, the high-end
    font market already has Activ Grotesk and other recent revivals. I fail to understand
    how this 22-weight family (especially considering 6 are just text versions of
    the display weights) could be considered more versatile or more valuable than
    some of the ones I listed above, or hundreds of other typefaces.\r\n\r\nI think
    they're assuming that people buying with a 1-user license will probably break
    that license and use it/share it with more computers. So they're just jacking
    up the starting price and using the 2-5 user license to justify it.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I updated that MyFonts list to show just how far $1232 could go for a freelancer
    like me. I prepared it pretty hastily, but the point is the same."

    of the same font. I guess that begs the question of why Font Bureau is selling
    it and promoting it like they are, but it doesn't matter really.\r\n\r\nAs for
    why I posted this? Well it's the sort of thing I'd like to buy, yeah. But I don't
    NEED it, as I've already got Helvetica Neue (plus the mac-native Helvetica).  So
    when I'm making another font purchase, I usually tend to get something that's
    going to broaden my palette a little bit.\r\n\r\nAnd even if I wanted to use it
    in a project and bill the client, it'd be hard to justify it to them... \"yes,
    I know you've got Arial and Helvetica on your computer, and they look practically
    identical to this, but it's really worth it for the alternate capital R.\"\r\n\r\nI
    think it's the forced 2-5 user license that bothers me about this. It's like they're
    explicitly saying that they're aiming at in-house designers and design agencies.
    Which is fine I guess, it just seems discriminatory.  That or they're trying to
    compensate for piracy somehow... but that's being declared guilty without a chance
    to prove your innocence.\r\n\r\nWhat if Adobe eleminiated the 1-user license and
    started their pricing at two copies of CS6... people would be PISSED.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"I guess I'm an idiot then, I didn't know Linotype sold single-user licenses

    and co-develops fonts from the Linotype library under agreement with Linotype,
    and with other type designers. This particular design and licensing development
    took some time to create, and I'm delighted to hear that you found the licensing
    you were originally looking for. \r\n\r\nAs for need for this family at all, I
    understand that most designers seek things extra-Helvetican to purchase their
    lifetime rights to. I hope you appreciate that there are others, from designers
    to large corporations, who seek the densest possible array of choices when it
    comes to this area of type designs.\r\n\r\nWhether this is the best of them or
    not is beyond my simple sheep-herding tongue, though I do remember being asked
    for it quite regularly since the release of Fontographer 1.0.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    on the need for text and display versions, a lot of people understand that a single
    version of some glyphs, like the bold M in this case, are doomed to mediocrity
    when only offered once for all sizes of use. "

      definitely makes more sense.\r\n\r\n"

    guess Neue Haas Grotesk is supposed to be sold for the same price on both websites.
    The basic end user license from Linotype is usually for 1\u20135 computers = $54
    for a standard font and $65 for the pro version. Font Bureau\u2019s webshop though
    is set-up for their own standard licensing model, which only knows licenses for
    either one computer at $40 or 2\u20135 as the next tier. They are probably not
    allowed to sell it under $54 a style, thus you cannot select the 1-only license
    but have to chose 2\u20135. I heard they are currently working on changing it
    so the price for 2\u20135 will be the same as 1\u20135 at Linotype. If you want
    the fonts urgently, maybe just give them a call."
