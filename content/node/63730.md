body: "Hi not sure if its ok to post two at same time. Any ideas on either would be
  great. Looking for an alternative to compacta or helvetica compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)
  BasimPastillen.png\r\n\r\nFirst reads \"Basim Pastillen\" from a book called \"Sans
  Serif: The Ultimate Sourcebook of Classic and Contemporary Sans Serif Typography\"
  \r\n\r\nIt is credited as being from a Berthold Foundry catalogue. Does not specify
  which face it is though.\r\n\r\n2) KunstHalle.png\r\n\r\nFrom book about Swiss Graphic
  Design. The origins and growth of an international style. Page 214. Poster for Sculpture
  Exhibition by Armin Hoffman 1958.\r\n\r\nMight be Helvetica compressed or something
  but not quite sure.\r\n\r\nmany thanks \r\nsmallprint\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BasimPastillen_4193.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kunsthalle_4639.png]"

    case its Anzeigen. \r\nI am more interested in finding out what font the Basim
    Pastillen ad is as that actually came from a Berthold Foundry type specimen book.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."
