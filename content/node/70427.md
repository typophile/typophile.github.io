    British type designer David Quay designed Blackmoor in 1983. Based on an old English
    letter style, this textura-style Blackletter evokes a mediaeval character, expertly

    historical publications to horror movies, and comics.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\u2026

    futher narrowing of the intended user base from the another version of this typeface,
    which already has a narrow intended group of users.

  body: Nick's got it. Well done! Sassoon is a typeface designed by Dr. Rosemary Sassoon,
    a handwriting researcher and typographer, especially for children to read. Each
    letterform has been thoroughly researched with tests of actual children reading.
    It comes in four versions, of which the most recent, "infant", is for younger
    children and includes more handwriting-like glyphs.
