  body: I hunted through my Sans Font ID Guide, but couldn&#39;t find a match for
    the rather closed a &amp; e and rather open g.  I am hunting through the &#39;Dutch
    Type&#39; book in case this was done by a Dutch type designer.

  body: No luck in the &#34;Dutch Type&#39; book, although it somewhat resembled a
    typeface designed by Jan Tholenaar for large-print books called &#39;GLB-16&#39;.
    This was used between 1973 and 1974 for printing about 50 books for sight-impaired
    readers. It was one of the first Dutch digital typefaces.

    a caption for the covers in cyan.  <BR>It says &#34;Composer set in Classified
    News, enlarged&#34; <BR> <BR>If you jump back to page 22 you&#39;ll see mention
    <BR>of Karl setting his work with an IBM composer <BR>and then enlarging the result.
    Also on page <BR>18 there is a specimen of the face shown in a  <BR>few sizes
    with some rather raucous text settings. <BR> <BR>I love it. Clunky, loose and
    strangely charming.
