body: "I'm creating a logo for a bike shop named Bike Rx.  I've been using various
  pharmaceutical images and have somewhat settled with the pill. I've used mostly
  Helvetica for the text because of its presence on many prescription bottles and
  medications.  I plan to use the theme throughout the store with mock prescription
  forms for price tags and prescription bottles for business cards.  The logo is what
  I'm having trouble with.  Here are some examples.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logospillvariations_6038.jpg]"

  body: I like 12, but I would split the pill between "bike" and "RX", and increase
    the contrast between the 2 reds. The outline should probably be the darker red.

  body: "You don't have to centre the text within the pill - try option 3 from your
    last post but make the right side of the pill a little wider (not too wide or
    else you get a sausage!) Even if the line isn't in the exact centre of the pill,
    it'll probably look OK optically. Or maybe not.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: You can bring the right edge of the pill in, closer to "RX" on all these.
    There is too much air there. Also, maybe break the 2 reds with a white line as
    well? Of these 3, I think 1 is the closest.

    body: Brought the right side of the pill in and put in the white line as well.  I'm
      thinking maybe of using a less vertical "Rx" in order to take up more space
      and balance out the spacing.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whiteline_4484.jpg]

  body: Allright, I'm stripping this thing down to resolve the spacing issues.  If
    I create a thicker outline of the pill I reduce the space for the "Rx" to occupy.  What
    do you think?  thanks for the help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alternateoutline_5512.jpg]

  body: "These are looking very nice. I like the first two better than the last two
    - the weight of the outline matches the weight of the text better.\r\n\r\nOther
    than the colour, what is the difference between the first two? Is there something
    subtle that I'm missing?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    body: Just the color is different.  Would you stick with the same type for "Rx"
      or something with more width to it?
