  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this logo was a custom design for the company.
    The \"Brands of the World\" website has very little background info and states
    that the designer is unknown, but a scalable vector eps of the logo is downloadable
    from here:\r\nhttp://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/gola-0\r\n\r\nAs for an actual
    font that it may be based on, the only idea I can come up with is - maybe have
    a look at Koloss and any similar typefaces, available @ www.identifont.com.\r\n\r\nAs
    a customer, maybe you could even contact Gola direct via:\r\nhttp://www.gola.co.uk/"

  body: Agree with Doghouse. Definitely custom (and not a good one in my opinion,
    /a looks terrible). Koloss might be a good choice for a customization. You might
    also consider [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bodoni+poster|Bodoni Poster]]. /G
    could be created with /O, right cutting and adding a crossbar to it. The rest
    is really easy. Keep /o, a vertical bar as /l and recreate from scratch /a (basic
    geometric shapes), just needs to keep /o counter shape.
