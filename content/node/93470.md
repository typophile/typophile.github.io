  One project in particular, interests me. \r\n\r\nThe story involves a team of robots
  that are not your \"Transformer\" (mean, warlike) types but not \"Rollie Pollie
  Ollie\" either.   Everything from \"Iron Giant\", to \"Johnny 5-0\", to \"iRobot\"
  solve this challenge differently.\r\n\r\nAny faces the guru's here might add to
  a list of type-faces that frame this \"spectrum\" between, from warlike to infantile,
  first-shooter warrior villain robots to the ever-cuddly but futuristic Wall-e (and
  his girlfriend \u2013 way sexy and modernly futuristic)?  \r\n\r\nI hope I'm being
  helpful.  I think it could be a fun list to build top to bottom. I'd have to say
  even Pixar strikes me as a candidate, because that animated mascot Lamp is so lifelike
  \u2013 and thus, a robot of sorts.\r\n\r\nThanks :)"

    as a means of reduced labour, and this is implicit in the origin of the word.
    As such, FontStruct as a font creation engine is a prime example of robotic type
    design, automating and reducing elements of the design process while imposing
    restrictions and limiting factors on what can be achieved. Parametric type design
    systems can also reduce the labour of the font creator in similar ways but with
    very different and less limiting results. Of course the human engineering, programming
    and labour involved in creating these constructs to begin with is enormous."

    software, or in a layout app (InDesign\u2019s \u201COptical\u201D kerning) doesn\u2019t
    make the font robotic. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s different about OpenType fonts that
    perform contextual substitutions is that they respond to the text they\u2019re
    setting\u2014a feedback loop, a little AI, and it\u2019s that imitation of human
    decision-making behavior that we associate with robots.\r\n\r\nThis concerns the
