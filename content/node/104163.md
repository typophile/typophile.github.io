  Matrix Wide Oldstyle, but those have oldstyle fonts which this font doesn't have,
  and some letters are slightly different."

  body: "Image not detailed enough to say anything for certain. Here is a <a href=\"http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/11133/11500568_1.jpg?v=8CE7270437D3000\r\n\">another
    image</a>, which is still not the best quality. RMN died in 1994 so unless the
    card was used in his final years perhaps something other than Matrix was used.
    Digital Matrix was designed by Liko in the mid 1980's as a Mac font. In the late
    1980s and early 1990s, business cards were AFAIK printed in other ways. Perhaps
    another font with the Latin style serifs used in Liko's Matrix?\r\nDon"
