body: Excuse me for being dense, but there are certain fonts I can use in my Word
  application that I cannot find in my Fonts folder.  Specifically, Albertus, Antique
  Olive, Humans along with others.  Any suggestions on where these fonts are located
  or what file extension they may use?

  body: Yes, these fonts all have a printer icon next to them.  Does this mean these
    fonts are not on my computer, but part of the printer software?
