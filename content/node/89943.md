  iconic or well known typefaces (and one personal preference) This was based on how
  far the type had traveled from the earths sea level (and still was visible, so I
  did not include launch notes printed in comic sans!)\r\n\r\nI had to make a reprint
  this week, and this got me wondering. I went for the easy pickings: Typefaces many
  people know, and achievements/places many people know. But I'm sure there are many
  more interesting tales of type traveling out there, especially further in history.\r\n\r\nSo,
  does anyone have some nice stories?"

    are only understandable by having a clue in advance of what they <em>might</em>
    \ say.\r\n\r\n(The Dutch \"Rijksoverheid\" one is, as it stands, a bit enigmatic.
    Is this used in underground bunkers?)"

    Apollo lander, or Helvetica on the Space Shuttle.\r\n\r\nThe Rijksoverheid font
    is used for the corporate identity of the dutch government, and since most of
    the Netherlands is below sea level, it's a small joke ;)\r\n\r\nThe New Johnston
    is of course used in the London subway, Garamond is used for the corporate identity
    of Stena Line. But yeah the texts do add a tiny bit of information, the lo-res
    stuff doesn't help. Should have SVG'd it.\r\n\r\nSorry if I was unclear!"

    can say this if you like, but in London it is the underground railway (and Johnston\u2019s
    letter was called after it).\r\n\r\nFor the resonance of the name \u2018underground
    railway\u2019 (or \u2018railroad\u2019 if you prefer), the escape network to the
    north for slaves, see the good piece in Wikipedia. I've always wondered how far
    the popular name of the system in London was an unacknowledged link to the US
    idea."

  body: You could probably add whatever faces Boeing and Airbus use for cockpit labels
    at the 12km line. Deep sea diving equipment... no idea if any of that has a public
    or official face. Erm... there is one sub at least whose images are overlaid with
    Gill Sans.

  body: "Joshua>I haven't sold any, just made some for friends or other typefreaks
    as a gift, but if you would like one, give me a poke. Transport can be a mess
    though, even for it's smaller size (It's about 34x59cm) I'd like a bit larger,
    but then my own printing costs in combination with a nice stock, make it almost
    impossible.\r\n\r\nJames>True, but well, Bodoni and Garamond weren't the original
    names (if they even had those) of the types when they were used. The Garamond
    is (in most revivals) even combinations of letterforms inspired by him. So I sortof
    stuck with giving them the name on how they could be found today as a typeface.
    \r\n\r\nI actually never had linked the official name of the London underground
    to the escape network, but that probably has to do with English being a secondary
    language, and I usually used the word subway instead. But it's a fascinating nod.\r\n\r\n>Paragraph:
    You are right, I actually didn't recall about the type on the record itself, and
    originally focused on the Pioneer plaque. However, I must say that the image of
    the cover is the more iconic image connected to the record. But a good addition
    still!\r\n\r\n>Te: I included Cooper Black (Easyjet corporate identity) and Bodoni
    (United Airlines) My main reason for this is that there is of course always type
    going places, but I had to make a choice on how visible and recognizable the type
    would be. But additions are always good.\r\n\r\nI included the Frutiger for subs,
    since it's the corporate identity of the Royal Navy, although this is a tricky
    one, since I've only seen Frutiger stenciled on hulls in PR renders/fresh launches.\r\n\r\nMy
    first version also included various unnamed stencil type which is used on some
    bathyscapes. Actually I could include the Trieste (which reached a depth of about
    11km) I should try to ID the type used (which is probably custom) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trieste-lettering_5717.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the addiitons, I'll have a peek at the Gill sub!\r\n\r\nI have some more pictures
    on my Behance site (don't slag me! it's useful to spread the type around! ;))
    Which also includes various slanted pictures with a pretty DoF which actually
    doesn't add anything and makes the text unreadable. But hey, it's it trendy!\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Type-Distance-Records/3114413]]"
