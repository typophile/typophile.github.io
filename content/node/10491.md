  and Helvetica? I guess we sang the Requiem too soon.

  body: Helvetica and Times both significant glyph variations between the normal and
    bold weights; the former in particular glyphs most notably &#39;a&#39;, the latter
    in the entire oldstyle vs modern shape category. This kind of thing wreaks havoc
    with simple linear interpolation. It will be interesting to see how, ahem, Macromedia
    &#40;right?&#41; deals with this. <BR> <BR>Another possible interpretation &#40;cue
    spooky music&#41; is that putting renewed emphasis &#40;npi&#41; on MM fonts is
    a symbol of independence from Microsoft. My understanding is that MM is effectively
    an optional part of the OT spec, and that MS&#39;s renderer doesn&#39;t deal with
    it.

  body: MM technology is not an optional of the OT spec. It was removed from the spec
    over the objections of Adobe and most designers. <BR> <BR>MS&#39;s renderer doesn&#39;t
    deal with MMs? Just drop one into your Windows font folder and see the instances
    appear in your menu. <BR> <BR>I agree that it is unfruitful to MM-ify either Times
    or Helvetica unless they are substantially redesigned. Nevertheless, we will see
    someone&#39;s interpretation in a surprising place quite soon.
