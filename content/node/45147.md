  the layout of a typography book due to be released in France, Belgium, Switzerland
  and Canada at the end of september. I have a huge load of documents to include in
  it, but some things are still missing, so I might, once in a while, in the next
  few weeks post a request, asking for some of you to kindly provide me with what's
  missing, if you happen to have these docs. As for now, I am desperately in need
  of a decent picture of Evert Bloemsma.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated, and aknowledged
  in the book of course.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ndr"

    I would contact him and ask for the rights to use it. We here at FontShop have
    a hi-res file if he doesn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/evert-bloemsma_5963.jpg]"
