  body: "From [[http://typophile.com/node/36729|another thread]]: \r\n\r\nJames Puckett,
    quoting James Montalbano:\r\n\r\n>There is money to be made in type...Take yourselves
    seriously for crying out loud!\r\n\r\nJames, that would be a great topic for Typecon
    2008 :)\r\n\r\nJames Montalbano:\r\n\r\n>James, that would be a great topic for
    Typecon 2008 :)\r\n\r\nIts my feeling that the majority of TypeCon should address
    this issue. The business side of type always gets short-changed at TypeCon. 4
    hours of Dwiggins vs 45 minutes of Q&A with Frank Martinez.\r\n"

    is fine by me.\r\n\r\nAdditional suggestions and proposals are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, we have set up a flickr group for found lettering around the Buffalo

  body: "Two suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Audio record the talks and workshops. The recordings,
    combined in a package with slides from the speakers could be sold afterwards,
    or given to attendees and sold to others. I think that particularly technical
    workshops would sell, as people on Typophile who couldn't get to conferences has
    said so. \r\n\r\nThe speakers would need to number slides and identify them as
    they talk. This approach might be easier to pull off and cheaper than trying to
    film the presentations, which would cost more. Often speakers are in the dark
    anyway. \r\n\r\n2. Have a panel to discuss optical size and type design. How do
    different designers treat problems of optical size--x height, contrast, spacing
    etc.? Does it vary with the intended use: Does what is desirable hange with newspapers,
    magazines, books, the web? What is the recent history of this--Adobe, FontBureau,
    H&FJ, etc.? Are there trends? "
