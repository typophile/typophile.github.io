  am thinking about to buy one as a general purpose printer here for my home office.\r\nI've
  searched for reviews here and on the internet, but have nothing found informative
  so far.\r\nThanks."

    experience to give you any advice on the choice though.\r\n\r\nI don't want to
    hijack your thread, but I'm also interested in this. My office are thinking of
    leasing a new laser to print brochures, flyers and such."
