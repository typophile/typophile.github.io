body: "Excoffon\u2019s Calypso now free for download! \r\n\r\nDuring research for
  my book Letter Fountain many typefaces passed my eye. Most of them designed with
  meticulous precision and based on the knowledge of readability and technical perfection
  achieved in hundreds of years. But sometimes fascination strikes when a designer
  leaves the common path. Roger Excoffon was one of them and for me one of the most
  striking typefaces was Calypso, a typeface that has a terrible readability, and
  you can even ask yourself why it is made in the first place. Marcel Olive, owner
  of Fonderie Olive saw Excoffon experimenting with an enlarged print of a half-tone
  screen at Olive studio. He was rolling it up and looked through it like a kaleidoscope.
  A metal type with half-tone dots was not done before and a technical challenge to
  achieve. Marcel Olive saw the chance to profile the technical capabilities of his
  foundry and earn a worldwide reputation and gave Excoffon permission to execute
  the design proposal. \r\n\r\nAfter establishing the angle and size of the dots by
  Olive Studio each character was drawn dot by dot using a pair of compasses. According
  to Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida, who lead the team at the studio, Excoffon made sketches
  of the outlines of each character and in the studio shading was added by airbrush.
  The airbrush shading was converted to a dot-screen that went from deep black to
  white. It was quite a challenge to transfer the drawings with a pantograph and to
  scale this complex drawings in different type sizes to the matrices. Then it had
  to be milled, retouched and casted in lead reproducing all the dots of the dot-screen.
  Calypso was cast in four sizes: 20, 24, 30 and 36 pt and had 26 capitals, a period,
  an apostrophe (used a lot in French), and a hyphen.\r\n\r\nMost of the typefaces
  ever made have been digitized. Calypso was no exception. I found and downloaded
  Calypso Boy from Scootergraphics (Digitized by Marty Pfeiffer) and Calypso by Profonts
  (digitized by Ralph Michael Unger). Ralph Michael Unger has added numerals, a question
  mark, an exclamation mark, ligatures and a lot of other useful characters, making
  it a complete digital font. By comparing the capitals I saw that they where quite
  different and it seemed to me that they were based on the Calypso silkscreen-printed
  rub down Letraset version because the dots were not round like on the original drawings
  I had seen in several publications and advertising for this typeface.\r\n\r\nOf
  course the original drawings were also not exactly the same as the metal type. As
  earlier written the punches that were cut by the Benton pantograph were retouched
  and because of that there were differences compared with the original drawings.
  So the final design had to be found in the actual cast type. I went looking for
  this type and found the site of D. Stempel GmbH that got the original matrices of
  D. Stempel AG and all the takeovers Stempel made during their existence. One of
  them was Fonderie Olive. I ordered a set of newly cast type from the original Olive
  matrices and found out that it was indeed quite different from the digital fonts
  that I bought. At that time Marjolein Koper was working as an intern at our design
  studio Polka Design and I asked her to digitize Calypso. The result was better than
  the fonts I bought but still I was not satisfied. After she came back to work at
  our studio on a steady base we photographed the metal type with a Micro Nikkor on
  a D800 to get the sharpest enlargement we could get. With this pictures Marjolein
  established the exact angle of the grid and we decided to begin again from scratch.
  Although it still is not an exact reproduction of the original metal type it has
  more detail and it can match almost the big reproductions seen in the first advertising
  in the French printers\u2019 yearbook \u201CCaract\xE8re No\xEBl 1957\u201D and
  recent publications with original drawings. You can download the result of our effort
  free on our site as TrueType font for Mac and Windows: http://www.letterfountain.com/extras_e.html

    The yearbook of course was published also in 1958 but the work shown in the book
    should be dated 1957. Enclosed two pictures from the advert, one with a transparant

  body: "We did not scan it. I think that inking (or like they did it in earlier years
    blackening it with a candle) would not make a better image but I did not try it.
    We have corrected the pictures parallax and because we made a grid (look at our
    YouTube video) and the fact that this grid fitted on each character we presumed
    that we corrected the parallax. The Micro Nikkor we used is not a zoom lens so
    has not much deformation in the lenses so I think that it is quite accurate. The
    Nikon D800 has a 36 megapixel resolution and is by that almost a scanner (almost
    100MB files). You have to remember that the drawings by Almeida where of course
    made by hand and so was also the following of the contours on the pantograph done
    by hand. So in that stage there is also some inaccuracy. I think also that their
    goal the mechanical look was and not a handmade look. We considered to scan it
    on our Epson V750 Pro which is also a top scanner but also works with  lenses
    (deformation). My other consideration was that you can create shadow and a sharper
    difference between side and top of the metal letter with photography while a scanner
    does not create shadow because the light source is almost where the scan unit
    is.\r\n\r\nI think that Monotype has officially the rights after Olive, Haas,
    Stempel, Linotype and Heidelberg. But the Profonts Calypso was also not published
    by Monotype (and the Calypso Boy was also a private project). When Monotype makes
    a better one I will take it of the website of course. The only goal is to have
    a proper and usable Calypso."

  body: Don't get me wrong about the legal rights of intellectual property. All the
    fonts we use in our commercial projects of Polka Design and Fontana Publishers
    are bought and licenses are paid. The making of the Calypso is a tribute to Excoffon
    and has to be seen like that. The license holders have had more than twenty years
    to publish a good digital font but decided, I think on commercial grounds, that
    it was not interesting enough to do so. On the other hand I think that the legacy
    of Excoffon and Almeida is important to the typographical community and for young
    students that have to be confronted with the mind set of designers like Excoffon.

  body: "It is a complicated discussion about licenses and intellectual property.
    There are always two parties involved. One is the holder of the rights and one
    is the maker of the work and his or her heritage. Just like paintings and other
    art the common opinion among collectors and museums is that you may buy a work
    of Van Gogh for several millions but you never own it. You pass it through to
    the next generation and you even have the obligation to take good care of it.
    Some time ago a Japanese businessman had put in his will that he wanted to take
    his painting of Van Gogh with him in his grave. Legally it was not possible to
    do so because of the reason stated above. It was public heritage. I think that
    Excoffons work belongs to our graphic heritage and that it has to be excessible
    for study and use. Preferrable by the rights owner of course. \r\n\r\nYou are
    right John. There are still some design flaws in our Calypso. Anchor points can
    still be reduced and there are some overlaps. We will make the font better in
    the coming time but I think that this still is a big step from what we had. We
    tested it and we had no problems with it."

    Olive sold the casting machines, pantographs, matrices and 100 tons of typefaces
    to Haas. Until his death in 1990, Marcel Olive retained control over the rights
    of the typefaces. He granted several foundries the non-exclusive reproduction
    of typefaces. Among them: Bobst, Compugraphic, Itek, Mecanorma, Letraset, Hewlett
    Packard, Linotype, Agfa, Adobe and Scangraphic. This information is said to be
    found in the archives of Marcel Olive (as mentioned in this publication)."

      scale down? You can do an OpenType font with PS outlines and leave the PPEM
      at 2048. FF DIN Round has a ppem size of 2000 units/em. During testing it in
      2010 one of the PDF-Writers made a mistake because the programers had forgotten
      to look into the FontMatrix. They had simply assumed that TT-flavoured OTF is
      always 2048 and PS-flavoured OTF is 1000 units/em. Luckily they took notice
      of this and updated their PDF writer. AFAIK, FF DIN Round has never caused any
      trouble ever since. Adobe also produces Arabic OTFs with a ppem-size of 2048
      units, so there are at least two manufacturers which took care that the pavement
      has been cleaned. So my advice is to stay with PS outlines, remove the overlaps
      and avoid scaling trouble by sticking with the ppem-size of 2048 units/em. I
      think that users who import your outlines in Illustrator will appreciate that
      too."

    and the smallest visible feature in that sort on Flickr (which I think is the
    closed counter of the \"A\") is about 0.7% of the Em. If the Em there is 4mm that
    comes out to just over 1/1,000 inches. So twice the resolution that Giampa states
    in that other thread. But still much coarser than Joep's scanner or camera.\r\n\r\nNow,
    4mm is about 11pt - presumable it was actually 12pt. If they did go down to 6pt
    that doubles the resolution. However we don't know if things like the counter
    of the \"A\" survived at 6pt. And 2000 dpi is still less than half the resolution
    Joep is working with.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's possible they used an especially thin
    cutter for that project - so thin as to break too often to be practical for real
    work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    demos. I've never seen those and miss Benton's dearly. I'm sure it was the best

    how it's wrong, so we can learn. And -as Joep reminds us- the Olive foundry had
    a technical advantage over its competitors \"\r\n\r\nIs that required, no matter
    how ridiculous the guess, or how persistent the insistence?  and, is Joep \"reminding
    us\" of a fact, or a claim? \r\n\r\nSo, let me put it this way \u2014 the \"exactly
    the same way\" above means drawing negative (wrong reading), patterning positive
    (right reading), punch cutting negative, matricing positive, type casting negative,
    so one can be printing positive. \r\n\r\nThe first three steps, where a pantograph
    may be used without recklessly abandoning economic sense, are only constrained
    by the required result, not the tool. The Calypso producer had access to the final
    design, (per letter), in the drawing, the patterning, and the punch cutting. So,
    some letters might have been drawn exactly to the punch, and others you would
    only recognize completely as a punch. \r\n\r\nBut ultimately there is not restriction
    on what a skilled one with a hand tool and zoom capabilites could do to the punch.
    This has been discussed several times here. \r\n\r\nI think, you were suggesting
    that they drew Calypso positive, patterned negative, skipped punch cutting, and
    cut thousands of matrices directly via an undisclosed direct matrix cutting process
    that left the face clear? Is that it? Besides showing me the shape of the cutting
    head, Why? What would make a founder abandon a normally barely profitable process
    as it was, for a rare display face they could do the exact same way as everything
    else with no apparent problem? \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, Hrant, there is nothing
    unique in the history of type, to be found in Calypso except for Calypso itself.
    There is no little space, no little shape, and no mystery combination of them
    that had not been punch cut before, though in different combinations than those
    that yielded Calypso. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n"

    they're based on my years of listening to experts and my -limited- experience
    using a pantograph (at Rimmer's studio). Could I be wrong? Duh. But guessing is
    all I can do, and \"ridiculous\" is mean-spirited hyperbole. That said, I do appreciate
    you taking the time to explain your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI chose the word \"remind\"
    carefully. Do you think Chamaret, Gineste, Morlighem and Rault are all wrong to
    trust their sources? If not, what <em>was</em> that technical superiority?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>there
    is not restriction on what a skilled one with a hand tool and zoom capabilites
    could do to the punch.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the pantograph's cutter
    is a restriction. Did they not use one? If you're saying they cleaned up after
    the pantograph (like that one guy in the Tetterode photo at the end of that thread
    I linked to) wouldn't <em>time</em> be a restriction? There's a reason that guy
    ended up losing his job... And remember that Excoffon was all about speed, for
    example producing Banco in two months.\r\n\r\nUsing a pantograph to directly cut
    a matrix (without making punches) is not mysterious; it's something little ol'
    me has done under Rimmer's guidance:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4099731186/in/set-72157622668087871\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm suspecting is there was some kind of twist to the conventional production
    you describe in order to get Calypso's sharpness of both inside and outside corners.
    But I admit I haven't yet taken the time to fully wrap my head around that idea.
    Luckily being wrong in public is the fastest way to learn!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>cut
    thousands of matrices</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy thousands?\r\nAnd why would the
    punches be far fewer? It's not like any design element in Calypso can be reused.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>there
    is nothing unique in the history of type</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUnless we're using
    a contrived definition of \"unique\", I don't buy that at all. Even if we're limiting
    it to manufacturing technology, there have been periodic inventions that have
    qualitatively changed some aspect of the result. The invention of the pantograph
    is an obvious big example; it caused the demotion of optical scaling (no matter
    how hard the Bentons tried to educate people).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    http://www.p22.com/products/makingfaces.html\r\nWith the film comes a metal type
    of a 'k'. Its production can be seen on the DVD. Buy it! You can also see in the
    film the principle of working with a pantograph. I compiled some pictures (stills
    from the film) so you can see the process. In the first picture you can see the
    stages from hand drawn original to an outline made in Ikarus software, a cut out
    original for the pantograph, an engraved matrix half the size and a matrix (copper)
    that is again made from the first matrix that is fifteen times smaller. In that
    small matrix he has cast the 'k' that can be seen in the last picture photographed
    from the metal type that is supplied with the DVD. I have visualised some stages
    (not all) so you can see the process. In the second picture from below you can
    see on the left the guiding pin and on the right the engraving tool that is very
    sharp and  that can make very detailed engravings. However you can also see the
    toolmarks it leaves on the surface of the casted metal type below. When he had
    made a punch he could have smoothened the surface and the result had been smoother
    on top of the metal type. This is the 'lack of sharpness' due to the mechanical
    process I talked about before. It has also influence on the contours of course
    and not only on the surface.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JimRimmer_P22_6282.jpg]"

    genius, commissioned it not because of its aesthetic attributes but because at
    that time only the Olive foundry had the technical means necessary to create such
    a typeface with hatched surfaces, making it a global benchmark for such a venture.\"
    So no detailed explanation, but a pretty firm claim, especially coming directly
    from a straight-shooter like Excoffon. Marcel Olive, I would expect to \"embellish\"
    the facts for appearances - but not Excoffon.\r\n\r\n* For reference here's the
    original French: \"Marcel Olive, qui avait le g\xE9nie du commerce, me le commanda
    non pour ses qualit\xE9s esth\xE9tiques mais parce qu\u2019\xE0 cette \xE9poque,
    seule la fonderie Olive avait les moyens techniques n\xE9cessaires \xE0 la conception
    de ce type de caract\xE8re, avec ses surfaces tram\xE9es ; lequel devenait alors
    une r\xE9f\xE9rence mondiale pour son entreprise.\"\r\n\r\nIf the above is true,
    it goes beyond the simple \"design novelty\" that you're -understandably- speculating.
    Another reason it was probably not merely design novelty is that those foundries
    were notorious for copying each other's ideas: we would likely have seen something
    like Calypso produced by Olive's arch-rivals D&P soon afterwards, but there's
    nothing. So maybe Olive produced Calypso because it was beyond being copied.\r\n\r\nPantograph
    limits: From what I know its use in type was particular enough that I'm not sure
    I could trust any generic/official numbers. For example a manufacturer might say
    they have a 1/4000 inch cutter, without realizing/admitting that it would be too
    brittle (and maybe too labor-intensive) for type production; I remember breaking
    a not-particularly-small cutter at Rimmer's studio (although of course most of
    that was inexperience). Plus we're talking about pantographs 50+ years ago; I
    have to assume precision and materials have improved. So I think it remains that
    asking people here (and probably on ATypI) is a potentially fruitful avenue.\r\n\r\nMark,

    touch up a six-pattern, a punch, or ten punches, or all the hairlines of the U.C.
    \ patterns. In other versions of the process the router was twice the end, as
    the \"success\" of the process was judged by getting from one letter drawing to
    several sizes of patterns and or punches without any manual intervention other
    than adjustments to the pantograph, and following the drawing and  the pattern
    dutifully.\r\n\r\nThese latter fonts usually were not such great junk, but they
    were being used primarily for smaller size junk in more insideous mass media duping,
    like newspapers, magazines and other free press activities. But the longer a Merg-like
    junk producer had to futz with the process, the closer they could get to better
    junk like Benton's. So by the time of founding of the font in question on this
    thread, most big founders were capable of many different qualities of junk, using
    a variety of possible duping processes.\r\n\r\nClearly, underlying all of this
    is that we are discussing a founding period not far removed from a war France
    had begun as an horse-powered, fort-seeking, agricultural nation, and ended understanding
    that they had to be on the road to the high tech nation they are today, or get
    clobbered every 20 years by a gas-powered, blitzkrieging, industrial \"neighbor\".
    I think maybe there was no invention here other than there were few better ways
    to say, \"We're back\", than Calypso."

    activity (with everybody striking a different personal balance between them).\r\n\r\nYou
    might have reason to think Excoffon was lying; I instead suspect -that's all-
    that we are still missing a piece of the puzzle (which might simply involve a
    deficiency among Olive's competitors rather than an exceptional technology at
    Olive). The most practical way to reveal this potentially missing piece is what
    I've been doing.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The width of the smallest router used is the
    tool's limit, but not strictly the limit of the process.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    and that's something I've referred to (for example via that Tetterode photo) a
    few times here. However once people have started paddling down the pantograph
    river they have often given up on using their oars for small course corrections
    and simply gone with the flow, even when they could tell the output was being
    visibly degraded. So you could call it the \"spiritual limit\" of the process;
    and that's where the minimum -viable- size of the pantograph's cutter stands up
    from the crowd of other factors (when it comes to nailing down Joep's \"(lack
    of) sharpness of the casting\").\r\n\r\nAs for Calypso being a \"we're back\",
    I think by that time: the French had already rebuilt their confidence, and developed
    their -sometimes grating- \"we don't need to prove anything to other people, they
    need to prove it to us\" attitude; Mistral -and other designs- had already done
    all the necessary proving, with foreign font houses eagerly licensing it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    technical superiority that allowed the production of Calypso) and the limit there
    was the size of the cutter (which IIRC is on the order of 1/500 inches for the
    smallest one*). What's interesting here is that a pantograph's cutter is circular...
    a perfect fit for Calypso! No loss of \"resolution\" due to the size of the cutter,
    <em>if you cut directly into the matrix.</em> However I'm not sure how the \"shearing\"
    of the circles (by the swooping curves) would end up working in such an approach...
    Maybe there was another step (actually there might have had to be two, two back
    to \"negative\" after a \"positive\") before the matrix.\r\n\r\n* They used bigger

    on a theoretical level. On a \"spiritual\" (hence eventually practical) level,
    once the pantograph is saving you effort, it quickly starts seeming inefficient
    to combat what the pantograph \"wants\". This is something the Bentons quickly
    discovered: as much as they tried to educate the customers of their systems that
    having a large number of masters (each for a narrow size range) was important
    for quality, their customers preferred to save as much time/money as possible;
    after all, readers weren't complaining... Eventually even ATF itself gave in to
    that.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>loaded with a published article and a magnifying glass,

    Banco. And he was already an Olive employee (in fact one with a controlling interest).
    Plus AFAIK he never worked with any other foundry (except for his -aborted- final
    effort).\r\n\r\nMy point was that Excoffon was not a hermetic, insular designer;
    in fact he was highly active on all fronts of French type and graphic design.
    So John's \"How did he know?\" seems to have a highly probable answer: he was
    paying attention. This BTW is something Rault's book does better than the one

    the one from Haas). Henk Gianotten kindly send it to me with an explanation. It
    measures 10 pt with the Lords Prayer. The dutch version has 380 characters. So
    it is smaller and has more characters than the one from Haas. Tetterode made 13
    metal types for the smallest book in the world (in 1951) that contained 6 intro
    pages and the Lords Prayer in 7 languages. The page size was 5 x 5.3 mm. The engraving
    was done during the night because Tram line 3 in Amsterdam caused trembling during
    the day that could influence the engraving by the pantograph. The book and metal
    type is still available at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Many thanks to Henk

    of course produced from films. The production method may have gone through several
    stages, but at a certain stage, the films were produced from red masking films
    (such as Rubylith by Ulano) which were either cut by hand or by a plotting machine.
    I recall a small booklet which describes that production process, also colleagues
    reported this after having visited Letraset in England. Around 1983, Letraset
    switched from cutting by hand to Ikarus, which meant that the artwork was digitized
    and corrected and then output on the aforementioned plotter, typically an Aristo
    flat-bed plotter. Of course the film cutters tried to compete with the machine
    output for some time \u2026 In the case of Calypso I think that the film cutting
    part has been left out. I think the characters were printed on baryte paper, then
    photographically enlarged, retouched and then again films were used to create
    the master film from which the  films for the sheets were produced. Anyway, there
    is no reason why a former Letraset typeface should show screen outlines."

    \u2014 I should think that, in general, the degree to which evidence of the screen
    might remain would have a lot to do with the viscosity of the ink and the absorption
    of the paper/substrate. \r\n\r\nIn the case of Letraset sheets, this was certainly
    no ordinary ink (and probably plasticized). It needed to cover relatively thickly
    and remain somewhat flexible, and it was not absorbed into the substrate, obviously
    (otherwise, how would it transfer?). \r\n\r\nI can imagine \u2014 and this is
    pure speculation \u2014 that with enough viscosity, any effect from the screen
    could have disappeared as a result of surface tension after the screen was removed.\r\n\r\nWhereas,
    in an example like the postcard you showed, with thin ink and absorbent paper,
    edge effects from the interaction of the screen with the mask are more likely
    to remain evident as the ink sets almost as soon as applied. \r\n"

    pt and then enlarged with the repro-camera to 72 pt. That is why it isn't as sharp

    type designers in Germany. Like Excoffon he was very much interested in handwritten

    It has the same boldness and the gray parts are not translated to dots like Calypso,
    but are drawn as thin lines. Typical is also that Linotype did not make a digital
    font of it, maybe just as with Calypso for commercial reasons. So also there is
    a similarity. In 2007 P22 made a digital typeface based on the original drawings.

      more 'kerned' characters to improve the typographic quality.

    type (or maybe phototype?),</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPlease do not mix up design and
    production methods for artwork with the production methods for the Letraset dry
    transfer sheets. I did not mean to say that the sheets themselves have ever been
    produced from metal type. In some cases, the artwork for the typefaces was based
    on baryte prints from metal type. This method was not exclusive to Letraset though,
    the artwork for many typefaces from the photocomposition era was based on baryte
    prints, which were photographically enlarged and then retouched. Scangraphic has
    done some typefaces that way and late Bernd M\xF6llenstadt, the former type director
    of Berthold, told me a few months ago that the Berthold type studio also has been
    using this method. They even had to work this way for typefaces from their own
    library because in WWII the Berthold type foundry had been bombed and many (if
    not all) matrices had been destroyed. At the beginning of phototypesetting, the
    only access they had to many of their own typefaces was through printing offices
    that had Berthold typefaces in their type cases.\r\nConcerning phototype setting
    in the process from artwork to the sheets: I recall someone telling a story that
    (at least for some years) phototypesetting was used for the production of the
    films from which the screens for the sheets were produced. After the artwork for
    a typeface was completed, a 2,5 Inch film font was produced from the artwork with
    the use of a \u2018step-and-repeat\u2019 camera. The 2,5 Inch font was then used
    to manually phototypeset the artwork for the films (with a machine like the [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/8318050188/|Berthold
    Staromat]] or a [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/8596990195/|Dr.
    B\xF6ger Copytype]]) for the various screens. They had to produce about as much
    films/sheets as there were sizes to be made available. The production of the 2,5
    Inch font was an extra production step, but \u2018typesetting\u2019 the artwork
    (line-by-line) was faster than accurately mounting all letters individually."

    You can see in the table on the right that the tip diameter can be extremely small

    So I guess that for removing the biggest shunks they used a big cutter and for
    the detailed work where you had to remove less material a cutter with a small
    shaft. I think that the fact that you had to rework the punch or matrix was for
    a lot of German typefounders the reason why they began to use the pantograph engraver
    much later than in America. In America around 1893 and for instance Berthold began
    to use it in 1910. They had the idea that the letter got a mechanical look and
    you still had to finetune it after engraving. It was more the idea of craftsmanship
    that played a big role. It is the same as in around 1986 when typesetters and
    graphic designers had the idea that typesetting on the mac was not as good as
    the other (also digital) forms that where used on the Linotronic, Scangraphic

    than on a computer! Of course you can draw perfect dots in Illustrator (or Freehand)
    but in font software your grid only has 1000 pt in the normal situation. So the
    software forces anchorpoints on the available grid and almost no dot is round
    anymore. That is why I had to choose the 2048 pt grid that would create a much
    to heavy font for use in large text books for example. You maybe can't get it
    out of your printer or at least a lot slower. For a font like Calypso that is
    used only for headlines this should be not a big problem. However, also in this
    large version, when you would blow up the letter you will see deformation because
    it still forces the anchorpoints to the 2048 pt grid. With a normal typeface that
    has almost never perfect circles this is not a big problem but you will always
    have some lines slightly of your initial drawing.\r\nSo what is the nice conclusion
    of this, just because you have no restriction with a grid: MECHANICAL IS BETTER\r\n"

    we are not talking about a certain simplicity in construction that is mostly the
    case with metal work. I talk about the PostScript language that has to translate
    all information on a page in 1 and 0 digits to the printers were a limit is in
    memory and the deformation begins. I think that you also have had problems in
    the past when you made an Illustrator drawing with to many anchorpoints. When
    your printer has not enough memory to store the description of the PostScript
    file it will simply not print. I have had it several times and sometimes changing
    the printer brought some relief.\r\nAnd that has always been the heel of Achilles
    (I hope in English it is a good statement) of computer generated pages. And that
    is why the grid in font software is restricted to a certain amount of points.
    So you get a distorted letter like in my case with the Calypso on a 1000 pt grid.
    Because the mechanical method has no grid restriction it can be exacter than the
    digital font. Of course other things like worn bearings or shaking of the hand

    at Skyline type Foundry who took over the matrices of Typefounders of Phoenix
    as I wrote before. I thank Sky Shipley for his quick shipment and his efforts
    to find the 48 pt metal type he had and which was \u2018old stock\u2019 and was
    casted by Charles Broad when it was still Typefounders of Phoenix.\r\nAs you can
    see in the pictures below the 48 pt version of Dimension is actually the same
    as the Olive Calypso 36 pt, which was the biggest version Olive produced in metal
    type. The 24 pt version of Skyline is actually the 20 pt Olive version. So I prosume
    that the range 20, 24, 30 and 36 pt of Olive became 24, 30, 36 and 48 pt in the
    Dimension version. The 48 pt was not mentioned in the brochure I showed before.\r\nIt
    is not as strange as one can think. The Didot point used in Europe was 0,376 mm
    (0,0148 inch) and the Pica point used in the US was 0,351 mm (0,0138 inch). Not
    to confuse of course with the computer pica which is 1/72 of an inch. So the body
    of the metal type of 36 pt from Olive is 13,54 mm and the metal body of 36 pt
    in the US is 12,64 mm, So about 1 mm or 0,0394 inch less high. So the 36 pt does
    not fit on an American 36 pt metal body!\r\nAs you can see a part of the 48 pt
    metal body is not used. Also the Dimension \u2018N\u2019 is upside down. I placed
    it upside down to compare the form and dots better. As you can see the detail
    is a lot less than the one from the Calypso.\r\nThe second picture shows the \u2018A\u2019

    Calypso/Dimension in metal type available. On this sticker I placed a red dot
    at the characters that are flipped. In the digital version of the Profonts Calypso
    only one character is still flipped as mentioned also before in this thread. Note
    also that Unger made an alternative version for the zero. In the Skyline version
    it is the same as the \u2018O\u2019. The 1 is a flipped \u2018I\u2019 both with
    Skyline and Profonts. The 4 had no eye in the metal version of Skyline and looked
    quite dark because of that. Unger made it a better match. Also the 6 in Ungers
    version is better in my opinion than the metal version of Charles Broad (Skyline).
    Although I think these additions are not matching in even grayness with the alphabet
    Excoffon created at Olive. I think you can see that clearly on the box sticker
    of Skyline.\r\nThe shown version of Unger is not complete and has more signs and
    diacritics than I have shown in the picture below. A complete character set can
    be seen on http://www.linotype.com/search/Calypso#6abad67f4cff65a7aa3a8f0bf4f162c6\r\nIn
    have no full printout of the metal version of Olive Calypso so I could not complete
    the pictures below with that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Skyline_Calypso_S_6339.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ProFontsCalypso_CalypsoPF_S_4359.jpg]"

  body: "Although I closed this thread for myself a week ago I today received a specimen
    that I could not resist to place on this forum. It is called Mr. Antique Volume
    10, Ornate & Antique Type by Typefounders of Phoenix. I earlier showed a similar
    colored specimen by Los Angeles Type Founders that took over Calypso/Dimension
    matrices from Typefounders of Phoenix. \r\n\r\nThe type specimen shown here is
    probably from the early sixties. The information on page 2 says: 'These type faces
    are from the early 19th Century from the Old Type Foundries of ...' followed by
    a list of American type founders like Bruce, Barnhart, Dickinson etc. Olive is
    not mentioned in this list but beneath every specimen the former foundry is mentioned.\r\nAs
    you can see in the picture beneath the Dimension is written: 'A French Styling
    of the Late 19 Century'. As we know the Calypso was a new design by Excoffon from
    1958 so it was only a couple of years on the market when Typefounders of Phoenix
    made a copy. Together with the mirrored characters and the typo in the first line
    I think it is a gem and real 'camp' of the sixties.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MrAntique_S_3618.jpg]"

  body: "I mentioned earlier in my post http://typophile.com/node/103339 that I thought
    that Excoffon maybe got inspired by the 3D cartouches that were made in the nineteenth
    century. I have another clue that can support that. In Caract\xE8re No\xEBl 60
    the picture below can be found in the story about Excoffon. This cartouche did
    he make for an advertisement. The only thing that it is not dated and it could
    be made after he made the Calypso. But still the fact that he used a modern form
    of a cartouche in his type specimen of Calypso indicates that he had special interest
    for that art form.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CartoucheExcoffon_S_6714.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cartouche1_Calypso_S_6264.jpg]"

    consider it a roughly cigar-shaped enclosure for some text, but maybe that's too
    tight.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The first time cartouches were seen were in Egypt. The oval frames in the
    top picture. They are architectural frames. But you can even see them on the Rosetta
    stone, of course cut out in the stone! The map with sheets that contain drawings
    of cartouches I showed before in this thread were inspirational drawings for architects.
    So it were 2D drawings that were really meant as 3D examples for cartouches like
    you can see in the picture on the bottom. In this example it is made from wood
    but mostly they were carved in stone. You can find them all over Europe but mostly
    in France and Italy. The interesting thing is that, as you say, you can also find
    them on cigar bands and more luxury goods were they have also a blind embossing
    and are in fact also a 3D representation. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cartouche_Egypt_5602.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cartouche_Regnaudin_Amelot_de_Bisseuil_4131.jpg]"

  body: "The interesting thing however was that Excoffon turned it around. He made
    cartouches that looked like 3D but were meant as 2D. Just like he did with Calypso.
    In the picture below you see some more examples of how he was experimenting with
    that concept. But more to fool the eye than to make it too serious like the old
    cartouches we used on our postcards. It is a bit like M.C. Escher did. Do you
    really see what your brain tells you?\r\n\r\nIn fact, I read that the name cartouche
    comes from the Italian \u2018cartoccio\u2019 that means \u2018rolled paper\u2019.
    It was the form of rolled paper or leather that was carved in sand stone. It was
    used around a round window, as a frame for the founding year of a building and
    as a frame for text. During the years they became more extreme in form and appearance.
    Excoffon went with his cartouches and with his Calypso back to the early form
    of these cartouches, that of rolled paper.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Excoffon_3D_S_5201.jpg]"
