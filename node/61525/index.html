<p>«He showed some preliminary sketches for the script, which he cheerfully admitted were entirely bogus, saying, ‘Almost all of the preliminary sketches you ever see for a typeface are bogus, created after the fact because a reviewer asked to see them’.

<p>I can&rsquo;t leave this uncommented. How about other type designers here? It&rsquo;s frankly not true at all in my case. I don&rsquo;t start a new design with anything but ideas and pencil/paper. I&rsquo;m always sketching. Once an idea starts taking shape, there can be many, many re-drawings of key characters before any digitization takes place. It&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m most comfortable working because I have done a lot of drawing and lettering. And most of those pages don&rsquo;t look either neat or perfect. Is that what people really expect, or want, to see?</p>
<p>If publications want to see early stage material of a typeface, it is likely that the designer is reluctant to show them, because often the early drawings, and even several iterations of proofs, can look unflatteringly rough, half-baked and even unrecognizable. Carter has said that he doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable with the drawing stage and does very little drawing. It&rsquo;s just one way to work, and clearly it&rsquo;s a viable one. But I don&rsquo;t think a generalization can be made from that.</p>

<p>This is often how we work at Pangea design when making typefaces. It&rsquo;s an easy way of documenting small problems that you want to correct.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a difference between a corrections sheet and sketches. Personally I dont sketch much on paper, but Örjan on the other hand makes wonderfully drawn letters on paper. I guess it&rsquo;s personal.</p>

<p>No, because novels are already perceived as crafted, laborious and creative works of artists. Fonts, on the other hand, either ‘have always been around’, or are ‘spit out by some computer program, if you just hit the right button’.</p>
<p>The sketch is an icon, a piece of evidence for the tedious and sophisticated process of type design – and the human mind (even better: the human hand) that has been involved in it.</p>
<p>While novels might not be promoted with showings of edited manuscripts, their authors are very often depicted <a href="http://cubaa.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/cocktail-called-hemingway/">in the act of writing</a>, or with their tool – be it a <a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/design/files/2009/03/paul_auster.jpg">pen</a> or a <a href="http://quadri.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/much-ado-about-nothing-nihilism-and-modernist-literature-part-3-of-4/">typewriter</a>. I’d rather see some more (informative) correction sheets than those pictures of the type designer sitting in front of a screen, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-21891-4.html">working on the kerning</a>.

<p>Kent,
I think that this is truly the way he works. I remember him saying so at the New York TypeCon.  It is kind of like the art directors of his (and my) generation working with designers.  I don&rsquo;t think this method is used by type designers in general&ndash;Probably at Linotype with Zapf and Frutiger where there is really a staff. The exception is probably one type designer showing his work to another and asking for a second opinion from a friend.</p>

<p>Good point, Kent. However, if you show someone else’s comments you’d be saying: “Well, I am not that good, but fortunately an expert looked at my errors”. If the corrections are done by the type designer himself, I certainly perceive them as a sign of careful handcrafting.</p>
