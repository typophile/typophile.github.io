  body: Have you seen it used anywhere else? I think it is custom work. I can't imagine
    what some letters in a full alphabet of that would look like. I'm a big fan of
    scripts, both hand-lettered & digital, & I've got to say I find the lack of difference
    between the letters & the connectors here very wrong.

    Very 80s metal band.\r\n\r\nThe dress is nice, but reminds me reminds me of that
    special sheet used to consumate the marriage in \"Like Water for Chocolate\"\r\n\r\nDavid"

    I agree-I think it is wrong in the bridal dress format-but I love the font none-the-less.\r\n\r\n"
