  entries for Valentype in less than 48 hours</a> on the \"local\" blog Unzipped,
  and now we <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/valentype-2009-the-gallery/\">only
  have 40 on after a week or so</a>. -Did the number of type lovers dwindle so dramatically
  over the past year? ;^)\r\n\r\nWe need at least ten more. Get busy, or nobody wins
  anything. :^P\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/valentype-2009/\">Valentype
  | Testify and Win The FontFont or OurType Font You Love!</a>"

    back to work\u2026 :)\r\n\r\nBtw, Yves: How would one go about submitting two
    entries about the same font? \r\nIs it better to make the filenames the same,
    or to append a \"2\" or something?"

  body: Yes, def -- add a number or something. As long as the file name includes both
    your name and the name of the desired typeface you're good. :^)
