  body: This seems to be a script style I haven&#39;t collected yet. The closest I
    can find is Letraset&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/hand-drawn/hand-drawn/testdrive.html?s=THE+GINGERBREAD+MAN&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">&#39;Hand Drawn&#39;</a>. Flattening/widening would make it look
    closer, I think. <BR> <BR>This leads me to think this is either custom lettering
    &#40;easy &amp; cheap to do for handprinted styles&#41; or a freeware font that
    could come from anywhere.
