  body: "That looks like a typical Russian (Soviet) subway carriage, so you may want
    to look for \"Moscow Metro\" \"carriage signage font\" or something along these
    lines. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metro_systems#List|looked
    it up]] and you are right! Almost right :) Budapest' subway is the 4th oldest,
    built in 1896. I would have never suspected that."

  body: "Florian: How did you find Flat Top Threes? It's certainly there via your
    link, but it supposed to be listed under Genres, but when you click on Genres,
    it's not there!\r\n\r\nAbout the \"oldest\" subways/undergrounds: According to
    Wikipedia, by country: UK, 1863; US, 1870; Hungary, 1896. But if you count Metropolitan
    Railway and South London Railway separately...\r\n\r\nHowever, \"Atlantic Avenue
    Tunnel is officially the world's oldest subway tunnel. This tunnel was built in
    1844, under a Brooklyn Street.\" See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQuFTl7D4s "

  body: Indeed, Hungarians pride themselves on having had the first subway on the
    Continent. These pictures, however, were not taken on that particular line as
    they feature the (rather ugly) blue trains instead of the characteristic yellow
    ones of Line 1.
