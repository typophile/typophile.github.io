  body: "I'm having a hard time finding a category with anything like this style.
    I have checked MyFonts, Identifont, and Dafont, looking for any close styles.
    There have not been many, which surprised me. One font called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/imperfect/|Imperfect]]
    from T-26 was promising as a potential source of key words or similar fonts, but
    the results were not close. I also checked the Distressed/Strange Script fonts
    in my Guide, but not much was similar besides [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-farmhaus/|Farmhaus]].\r\n\r\nIf
    I were trying to describe it I would say \"irregular sans\", but searches along
    these lines were not helpful.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely to be a freebie, but I don't
    know where to look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
