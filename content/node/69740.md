body: "This font is used elsewhere on the product packaging so I'm guessing it's not
  a custom logotype \u2013 Swarfega doesn't strike me as the kind of brand to have
  commissioned a font. My first thought has Compacta because of the extremely high
  x-height and condensed weight but this is far more curved on the ascenders/descenders.
  Any help would be really useful. Thank you in advance for your help.\r\n"
