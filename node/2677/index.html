If you could tell me which characters seem inconsistent with others, that might help if there is an optical distortion that I don't see because I'm so close.  I'm taking a look at the P,B,G,and W.

		<div class="commentbody">I think what Chris means about the thickness is some of your diagonals: like the M, that is way off from the rest. It isn't really up to mathmatical precision of your stems, it is also things like the terminals and horiz/vert joins and the spaces around and within the glyphs. The size of the  'e',  for example, iseems larger and lighter than the 'd'. The hairlines in 'v' seem thinner than those of the 'y'. This is a good, fairly complete start! I reckon the next step is to make the glyphs a little more consistent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kris.</div>

I have about a thousand glyphs, including 50 ligatures so far, nearly complete Greek and Cyrillic glyphsets, IPA characters, and extended Latin characters.  The reason I put the simple Roman out is that I can use that information throughout the face.  The mistakes I've made here are ones I have probably made everywhere, and I've already started using these critiques throughout.</div>

This is a great first effort! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, what are the issues of structure and finish that you see being detrimental to the face as it currently stands?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Being a first effort, you've turned up many of the classic first time problems. Many of the issues turn up as a result of the constructed nature of your font (ie. you've borrowed the o to make the c, you've borrowed the c to make the n, youve borrowed the n to make the h, and I don't know why she swollowed the fly.) This is a very common way of doing things (even among accomplished designers). With time you will learn how the constructed letters need to be *fixed* to look correct. Aside from that, consider first the following font-wide problem: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stoke Modulation:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is the location and flow of the thicks and thins of your font. Kudos to you, the locations of thick and thin look pretty good, it's the consistent application of thick and thin that is a big issue here</div>
