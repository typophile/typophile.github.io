body: Hi, <BR>I am a software developer and need a lot of help! <BR> <BR>I think this
  is possibly a place to get some help with a project I am working on. <BR> <BR>I
  am working on an application to create PDF files from scratch. As I want to display
  various formatted text in the pdf file, I need to know about the font metrics to
  calculate lengths of strings I would write to the pdf file so I can present the
  text correctly. I have been reading about afm files to get these font metrics. I
  have also been reading about OS functions that could possibly return font metrics.
  <BR> <BR>I am looking for some experienced guidance. <BR> <BR>Where do I get AFM
  files? or font metrics? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your help!
