  body: "Your sample maybe from Castcrafts's OPTIFONTS - they use to have on typositor
    Caslon-Condensed. I know they digitized their Caslon-Bold Cond. - you'd have to
    call them to see if they still have the family - and if they could get you a sample.
    But it does seem to match up.\r\n\r\nThey are still around and can be reached:

  body: "That's [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/CaslonFB/charset|Jill Pichotta's Bold
    Condensed Caslon for Font Bureau]]. Here's the explanation from the Font Bureau
    site: \r\n\r\n\"Our familiar Caslon Bold headletters were invented around the
    turn of the twentieth century in the United States and were only loosely based
    on William Caslon\u2019s romans. The best of the Caslon Bolds originated at the
    Keystone Type Foundry of Philadelphia, whose Caslon Bold Condensed appeared about
    1905, probably drawn by R.F. Burfeind. Jill Pichotta revised his Bold Condensed
    & drew the Bold Extra Condensed; FB 1992\""
