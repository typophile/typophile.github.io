  body: "This style of lettering goes back to Rudolf Koch's Neuland of 1923.\r\nI
    didn't spot an exact match -- it might not be digitized -- but here a couple of
    fairly similar fonts: Xavier Sans Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/xavier/
    and  Aarde Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/aarde/\r\nAlso an assortment
    of somewhat similar fonts, including Lithos Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/lithos/
    but they don't seem as close as these two."
