  Chinese text to a font in this sort of style: http://www.identifont.com/similar?681\r\n\r\nAs
  it's going to be cut-out, counters/apertures need to be reinforced to as not to
  all out. I've been looking around, but I can't find anything (likely to be my total
  lack of understanding of Chinese/Chinese Alphabets!).\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    Macau) or Simplified Chinese (Mainland China, Singapore)? A Traditional Chinese
    typeface would be useless if you need to render a Simplifed Chinese text and vice
    versa.\r\n\r\nHow long is the text? If it is short enough, modifying an existing
    non-stencil typeface may be an option.\r\n\r\nIt feels like there ought to be
    a stencil typeface for Chinese, but I can't find one despite looking through several
    foundries' offerings. I'm not familiar with Chinese typefaces in general, though."
