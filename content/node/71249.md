  body: Spot on, Tamas. That's it exactly. Thanks, but argh! I went to Dafont, and
    even into the 'Sci-Fi' section, but after trawling through page after page I think
    I gave up around 'T'. It's always on the next page, hey? Thanks again.

  body: "Tomi, I'm not sure what you mean. It's definitely Usuzi. I installed the
    font and set the text in Photoshop over my original sample. You can see in the
    image below where I've coloured the text with 100% cyan and set the opacity at
    80%. There's no overlap; it's bang on.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DreamTeam_cyan_4072.jpg]"
