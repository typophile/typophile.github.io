  body: "I read the comments at Dafont regarding Androgyne including this accusation
    of piracy:\r\n\r\n----start quote---\r\nxDupre  Aug 02, 2010\r\nI don't know how
    long Mr. Bigelow spent to design TEXTILE but I know I spent more than one year
    to design FF TARTINE SCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThis Androgyne is an interpolation between
    these 2 fonts. I did this operation, we arrive to the same result in less than
    2 minutes. Then, you probably spent 1 or 2 hours to remove the inconsistencies...\r\n\r\nDimitri,
    if you want to mix Textile and FF Tartine Script, you can do it for your personal
    use BUT NOT sharing it on DAFONT.\r\n\r\nI invite users to use professionnal fonts
    to support designers who spend a lot of time designing typefaces.\r\nCheck out
    my website to discover food types like the real FF Tartine Script or the completely
    new FF MASALA!\r\n----end quote---\r\nI would be very hesitant to use this font
    for anything commercial.\r\nDon\r\n"
