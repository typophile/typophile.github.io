  body: "This is what we call \u201Covershot\u201D. Round and pointy shapes need to
    extended slightly above and below square shapes to look equal to our eyes. Put
    an H next to them, and you\u2019ll see that the A also extends."

  body: "While overshoots below the baseline and above the cap height for letters
    like \u2018O\u2019 are sort of universal in well-designed typefaces, there is
    more variability in letters like \u2018W\u2019 (below the baseline) or \u2018A\u2019
    (above the cap height). Checking some widely used serif typefaces, I found that
    about two thirds have an overshooting \u2018A\u2019 and somewhat fewer have an
    overshooting \u2018W\u2019. <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-Fbx1T5\">FF More</a>
    by \u0141ukasz Dziedzic is an example that has neither of the two; <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-6xkVON\">Utopia</a>
    by Robert Slimbach only has a very slightly overshooting \u2018A\u2019. Obviously,
    the presence of overshoots depends on the design: A typeface like <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-QRKKdJ\">Garamond
    Premier Pro</a>, also by Robert Slimbach, wouldn\u2019t work without considerable
    overshoots in both letters. In sans-serif typefaces, overshoots are a lot less
    common\u2014for a reason. As Frode said, overshoots are meant to optically compensate
    for round or pointy shapes, but the top of \u2018A\u2019 or the bottom of \u2018W\u2019
    are neither round nor pointy in many sans-serifs. Nothing to compensate for, thus.
    I think the designers of Gotham are overcompensating here. Mark Simonson would
    probably agree because in his <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-AwRoxQ\">Proxima
    Nova</a>, a typeface with a design quite similar to Gotham, \u2018A\u2019 and
    \u2018W\u2019 don\u2019t show any overshoots."

  body: "Thanks Guys for the great explanations. I have now learnt something i didn't
    even know about. Much appreciated. So with this logotype would you leave it as
    an overshoot or correct it?\r\nCheers B."

  body: If you are going to create size-specific adaptations of the wordmark, you
    could leave the overshoot in the smallest versions (where it may invisibly improve
    the perceived vertical position) and remove it from a certain size up (where it
    will be visible to the naked eye). As I said, I think it is an overcompensation
    in this typeface and weight (but the designers of Gotham might know better), so
    if you only have one version of your logo, I would remove the overshoot.
