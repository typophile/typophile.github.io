  my hand at some web/blog concepts. I have two web locations that need critique from
  qualified folks. Friends and fam are great, but they love and yes to death. After
  witnessing the hearty reviews typical of the Type Battles, I submit the following
  for appetites with sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n1) My Website -- [[http://www.benmyers.org]]
  \r\n(I know the portfolio link is dead)\r\n\r\n2) My Blog -- [[http://www.honeyedmouth.blogspot.com]]\r\n(I'm
  getting ready to consolidate and move this to my domain)\r\n\r\n3) A website I'm
  working on for a friend -- [[http://www.commonconstruction.com]] \r\n\r\n(This is
  my first time soliciting feedback. Anything you have to offer is appreciated)\r\n\r\nBen"

    ]]\r\n\r\n  won't be too happy that you didn't credit them.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might
    want to change the contact info into a form, and not just a blank page with your
    name and e-mail.\r\n\r\nYou also need to title your pages, and not leave them
    as \"blank document.\""

    is unfinished.\r\n\r\n#2 Can you modify it so that it wouldn\xB4t be so wide,
    hard to read?\r\n\r\n#3 Hard to click on the thin pages, I would try other kind
    of navigation."

  body: "@ Jim -- I will give Flash Village credit.\r\n\r\n@ Miro -- you're right
    about the content width. I'll make a reduction to the column size in the template.
    I'm also finding the pages difficult to navigate, and while the concept is cool,
    it's not user friendly.\r\n\r\nCheers!  "

    Also, I'm working on the contact page. Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nI'm also
    considering scrapping the flash village template all together. The navigation
    may discourage people from checking out all the content.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    hard to read on screen.\r\n\r\nAlso, I suggest again you to post these to www.conceptfeedback.com,
    you\xB4ll receive plenty of feedback in no time."

    Mechanical Turk and thus requires very specific questions to filter out random
    reviewers.
