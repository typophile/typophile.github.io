  and the words \"Est. 1893\".  I'm 99% sure this was hand-drawn, so I'm looking for
  something to match roughly - the first design had an era-appropriate serif, but
  apparently they want a script.  Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ebraun_5356.png]"

  body: "Benton's Typo Script has a similar \"&\", but the font doesn't match as well.
    Original Script at Fonts.com is a version of it, I believe.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
