  I can't stay at the hotel for a year, although it would be nice.\r\nSo if anyone
  can give me a tip or knows of a place that will be free in september, please, let
  me know.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nSeb"

    like to visit it sometime soon.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your best bet might be to talk
    to some of this year's students before the course ends in a few weeks. They might
    be able to give you some leads, or you might be able to move into an apartment
    that one of them would be moving out of.\r\n\r\nDo you speak Dutch? There must
    be plenty of student websites in the Hague where people place apartment rental
    notices.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDan"

    should be of use.\r\n\r\nAlso consider other cities for housing. The Hague isn't
    much of a university city, so temporary, affordable housing isn't big there. Consider
    Rotterdam, Delft, Utrecht and Amsterdam as alternatives at travel distance. More
    exciting cities as well.\r\n\r\nHousing in the Netherlands can be a bit of a nightmare,
    so best of luck.\r\n\r\n*EDIT* Just read about the anti-squat housing. This is
    a great option if you're on a budget and not as illegal/dodgy as it may sound.
    You can get very comfortable and very temporary living space for a very low price.
    You'll have to put up with an alternative crowd, but they're not as wild as the
    word squat might suggest."

  body: "\r\nHallo Seb,\r\n\r\nDo you know the recommendation from one type and media
    student?\r\n\r\n\"Even I already lived at several places, also abroad, I am having
    the most trouble with housing here in The Hague. That's why I place a few notes,
    helping people not making the same mistakes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, look for a place
    to stay very early in advance! This means also to subscribe to lists (student
    housing or housing pools), because the longer you are on the list and the further
    you live away the better the chances to get a room. Following a few addresses:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.duwo.nl
    - duwo is a student housing organisation with furnished or unfurnished appartments,
    rooms, studios\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kamernet.nl - kamernet is a housing platform
    where you have to subscribe to react to ads, it is worth doing it\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stroom.nl
    - stroom is an art organisation handling the anti-squat housing in the hague\r\n\r\nhttp://www.huisbel.nl
    - online mailing list for housing\r\n\r\nHousing agencies are also an option,
    they usually charge one month rent as commission fee. There is one around the
    Academy which you definetly should avoid. It is PR Housing who are fooling clients.
    One month security fee is common. Don't pay any rent upfront!\r\n\r\nIf you bring
    your car with you, in most streets you have to pay (sometimes till 24:00) and
    the fine is 45 Euros. You can get a parking license for 6 month for 48 Euros.
    Be aware of temporary no parking zones, the city will imediatly tow away your
    car (298 Euros). Keep the car empty and the glove box open.\"\r\n\r\nI guess we'll
    see us in September\r\nSlade"

  body: "Sebsan, congrats!\r\n\r\nSlade has made some good suggestions. When I was
    in The Hague I lived in a <a href=\"http://www.duwo.nl\">DuWo</a> building which
    was fun experience because I was living with 16 people from 10 countries, but
    it was a little bit too dormitory-ish and a little more than I wish I was paying
    for the size of the room. If I did it over again I would have tried to find a
    place through <a href=\"http://www.stroom.nl\">Stroom</a> or with another anti-squat
    organization. The city of The Hague has a website that gives students information
    on finding anti-kraakt housing but I can't find it right now, but that would be
    something to look for.\r\n\r\nAndy"

    but it doesn't offer much help so I'll try to track down some more information
