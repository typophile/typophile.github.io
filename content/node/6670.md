  kind of 19th century flavor to a project I am working on. I&#39;ve been looking
  for a while, not finding a heck of a lot, and I thought some designers here might
  know of some good CDs. <BR> <BR>&#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://www.missmary.com"

  though they don&#39;t seem to be very high-res. &#40;I&#39;m asking them by email.&#41;
  Here are some images that may give some idea of what I&#39;m looking for. &#40;I&#39;d
  use the CD these came from, but they are all pretty lo-res.&#41; <BR> <BR>Older
  art &#40;of evil spirits from Middle Ages, for example&#41; is okay too. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

    get printing blocks made. Fun stuff when you have a legitimate need for them.

  body: There is this book series that have great victorian clipart. It&#39;s called
    &#39;Scan this book&#39;. the clip art is printed on good quality coated stock
    so fine lines a printed pretty well as opposed to other books which are printed
    on low grade paper. The price is also very reasonable. <BR> <BR>IM
