    mention a source for the fonts.\r\n\r\n[[Nick Curtis]] has his version of Nubian
    called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/slam-bang-theater-nf/?refby=typographica\">Slam

    .pfb and .pfm based fonts to work on my newer machine with OSX using FontExplorer

  body: Oops. Those are Windows PostScript font files. Looks like Steffmann's <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/n/nubian.htm">Nubian</a>
    is PC-only.
