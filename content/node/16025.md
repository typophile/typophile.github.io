  drills, etc.) I'm thinking maybe Herb Lubalin did it... does this sound familiar
  to anyone and/or can you tell me where I could see a photo of it?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There were quite a few \"photo alphabets\" shown from time to time in older
    issues of <em>U&lc</em>, several of which were done by Herb Lubalin. But these
    were essentially pictures of found articles resembling letterforms. If I can find
    one of these articles I'll try to post samples. As for an actual typeface, I don't
    recall a font using photos of handtools.\r\n\r\nThere are a few type designs using
    tools such as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/toolbox/\" target=\"new\">Toolbox</a>
    by Brian Strysko. "

    saw your post. Do you have to be hammered to use that one? \r\nAh screw it, you
    can use it sober too:-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
