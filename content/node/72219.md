  an anonymous visitor for quite a while. Thank you, guys, for letting your awesome
  expertise be available to dilettantes like me! \r\n\r\nHere's my first question:\r\n\r\nDo
  any of you know any good examples of the use of Compacta. I recently used it for
  a project, after having researched which font to use for a few months, and can't
  entirely stop. Here's what triggered my use of the font, a cover I spotted while
  the camera trucked over a magazine rack in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Sympathy for the
  Devil\" (1968).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sympathy-for-the-devil-Jean-Luc-Goddard-590_5874.jpg]"

    uses Compacta for some caption headings. (June 2010)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vogue-latin-america_3710.jpg]

    Compacta, too, right?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coming of age in samoa

  body: "And then there's this book cover from 1965. The words \"Sexual Fetish\" is,
    I believe, Compacta.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the sexual fetish front_3821.jpg]\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, the \"Coming of Age In Samoa\" book cover above is from 1963, so it seems
    they put that typeface to work right away! As far as I'm able to research it,
    the typeface is from the same year.)\r\n\r\nI wonder if anybody has any more info
    (more than the little I can find online,) on the typeface designer Fred Lambert,
    and the original Letraset font.\r\n\r\n"
