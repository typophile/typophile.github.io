body: "This blog entry marks the first in what is planned to be a series of reports
  documenting the design of my first font. An internal grant at UST has supported
  this project, which I call <em>Researching by Doing: Designing a Humanist Sans Typeface</em>.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some excerpts from my grant proposal that help to explain the rationale and
  plan:\r\n\r\n<cite>The premise of this proposal is that there are insights about
  the process of type design that I can best obtain by undertaking that process myself.
  By designing a font and submitting my design for critique, I aim to develop a more
  sophisticated visual acumen for the evaluation of type design. Furthermore, by designing
  a font to meet the same demands met by the class of historical types I study (the
  twentieth-century class known as \u201Chumanist sans-serifs\u201D), I expect to
  discover some of the same design hurdles confronted by the designers of those types.
  I will acquire font-design software, learn its use, design a font, subject my design
  to evaluation from experts in the field, and revise my design. I will also keep
  a journal of biweekly reflections on my efforts. This journal will be published
  as a weblog (itself subject to expert commentary) and will culminate in a report
  on the insights into historical type designs that I have gleaned from the contemporary
  process of font design.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>There are four humanist sans types that
  form the foundation of this project. The humanist sans serif category of type may
  only have emerged by name as late as the 1980s, but these typefaces from earlier
  in the century are commonly regarded as key precedents in its establishment. In
  the late nineteen-twenties, English sculptor Eric Gill produced Gill Sans, which
  has become the most widely used of the humanist sans types. German designer and
  calligrapher Hermann Zapf produced Optima in 1952, inspired by Florentine Renaissance
  inscriptions. Swiss designer Adrian Frutiger developed his eponymous type in response
  to a 1968 commission for signage at the Charles De Gaulle International airport.
  That same year, Frutiger\u2019s countryman Hans Eduard Meier designed Syntax-Antiqua,
  inspired by his studies of writing. These four types, Gill Sans, Optima, Frutiger,
  and Syntax-Antiqua, varied in their inspiration and application, but all aimed at
  a similar overarching goal: to discard the serifs and marked contrast (difference
  between thick and thin strokes) of traditional seriffed letterforms while retaining
  a sense of comfort, refinement, and warmth that went missing in earlier so-called
  \u201Cgrotesque\u201D and \u201Cgeometric\u201D sans designs.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>I
  will begin the process by inventing a complete \u201Cdesign brief\u201D for the
  typeface that is based on what can be documented or inferred about the commissions
  for the great humanist sans serif types of the twentieth century: Gill Sans, Optima,
  Frutiger, and Syntax-Antiqua. This brief will provide the guiding parameters for
  my own design. Then I will set to work designing a single weight of a font, minimally
  upper- and lowercase letters, numerals, and common punctuation. I will regularly
  (at least biweekly) report my progress, concerns, and insights on a weblog hosted
  by typophile.com. At milestones of the design (all capital letters completed, for
  example) I will also post the design to typophile.com\u2019s critique forum and
  respond to any feedback provided by its members.</cite>\r\n\r\nStay tuned if you're
  interested in following my progress (if I can be so optimistic), and wish me luck!"
