  yall are. I am trying to find the right title for these designs. I found an example
  by dover press shows that it is victorian, but can anyone tell me what else it could
  be called. \r\n\r\nI am trying to find references of this old etching design, so
  any direction would we great. (clip art, books, what ever) \r\n\r\n"

    like "Victorian frame." They've got some nice illustrations there, available as
    editable EPS files and really cheap.

    post) rather than woodcuts. Line engraving, steel engraving, drypoint, etc. Try
    typing these names into Wikipedia for more info on each technique. \r\n\r\nIn

    target=\"_blank\">some Dover titles now come with a CD</a> containing image files
    which you can copy to your computer and use in your work.\r\n\r\nAnother great
    source for this type of art is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Encyclopedia-Illustration-J-G-Heck/dp/0517183404\"

    body: "many of the images in dover collections are victorian copies of older designs.
      the styles get reinterpreted in curious ways. some of them, for example, are
      pen and ink copies of what was originally an engraving, which in turn was a
      rendition of a sculptural element.\r\nothers appear to be originally engraved.
      it's a real grab-bag.\r\n\r\nperhaps there's a term for this translation phenomenon.
      multi-stylistic generation loss ?\r\nthe Heck book is a wonderful example; it's
      full of them. some are quaint, others horrendous, still others apparently more
      original.\r\n\r\nthese frames look like victorian renditions of baroque styles,
      perhaps not copied, but \"inspired-by\".\r\n\r\nif i was going to label them
      i would make up a hybrid: victorian baroque mock-engraved framing ornaments.
      yikes! a bit unwieldy..."
