  body: 'Well you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to draw n first -- unless your instructors
    require it -- but it is the usual starting place. The n establishes a number of
    things about the face: x-height, basic lowercase stem weight, contrast between
    thick and thin strokes, curve speed &#40;i.e. how gradually or quickly the curve
    joins the straight&#41; and, perhaps most importantly, provides a sound basis
    for spacing. The relationship between the internal space of the n and the space
    between two n&#39;s is the typical basis for spacing a Latin typeface. You should
    not only draw the n, you should then arrange several n&#39;s in a row and try
    to space them.'

  body: Matheus, <BR>Perhaps your teacher is just trying to find an organized way
    for all class members to compare their experiences and the letter&#34;n&#34; would
    then be the common ground for discussion.  I am sure there are many different
    ways to begin a font.  I start with the lower case e and a and the tinker with
    ascender and descender letters untill I figure out the ratio that I want to use.  This
    is always subject to change for me at least. <BR>I am not saying do it my way.  I
    think you should do as your teacher suggests and learn from him what you can.  Later,
    after you get more experience, you can figure out what works best for you. Just
    keep working at it and don&#39;t fear making changes, you only learn by them.  You
    can always save every variation and compare them.  This is a good learning tool.
    <BR> <BR>Keep at it! regards, <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Matheus, <BR> <BR>I trained under Nick Schwabe, a Swiss pressman who had worked
    with Jan Tschichold. I am not sure what to say about the Swiss. Nick was better
    than good, he was excellent. However the Swiss, at least he and Jan Tschichold,
    were very fixed with their opinions. About as flexible as a straight edge. <BR>
    <BR>Nick reminded me of my sister&#39;s husband. My sister&#39;s husband always
    insisted the correct way to bake a ham was to cut the ends off before putting
    it into the oven. His siblings did the same thing. My sister cut the ends off
    the ham before baking it under great protest because of the peer pressure upon
    her. Then one day her &#34;mother in law&#34; came over for dinner, yes, baked
    ham, and my sister asked her, &#34;why do you cut the ends off the &#34;ham&#34;
    before you bake it? Her &#34;mother in law&#34; told her she doesn&#39;t, she
    only did that when the &#34;ham was too big to fit into the oven&#34;. So don&#39;t
    be one of those &#34;automatic ham end cutters&#34;. The reason may not be as
    good as you think. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html</a> <BR> <BR>So, although
    I have experience with Swiss printers, I have no experience with Swiss type designers.
    Perhaps you may think about this. The Swiss style tends to be mechanical rather
    than humanistic. That comment is bound to raise the ire of many in this forum.
    In fact I am not entirely married to the idea because I have examples of the opposite.
    <BR> <BR>Swiss type cutters worked much differently than the English or the American.
    Hunter Middleton of Ludlow expressed to me that there were two basic schools of
    Swiss/German punchcutters. One would cut a <i>counter punch</i> with the expectations
    of <i>first cutting a perfect punch, second striking it with perfect results</i>.
    A serious challenge in craftsmanship for sure.The &#34;other Swiss/German school&#34;
    did not believe in the counter punch but preferred, &#40;wink, wink!&#41; to cut
    it with gravure. By this I mean a counter punch was never used. <BR> <BR>A common
    practic with American and British punchcutters would be to cut an undersized counter
    punch, strike it, then clean up the imperfections with a gravure. <BR> <BR><i>A
    counter punch was not struck when using a Benton Punchcutter, the counter, in
    name only was cut much as they were in the Swiss/German school.</i> <a href="http://lanstontype.com/BentonPantograph.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/BentonPantograph.html</a> <BR> <BR>So,
    like I say, as you have pointed out, if it is true, the Swiss are the Swiss. And
    then there are others. The question to ask, which are you going to be? John seems
    to have followed the Swiss, I would have thought him to have been more British.
    John by the way is very good. Follow your own instincts, find out what works for
    you. I think if you &#34;re-read Sol Hess&#34; you will understand his great wisdom.  <BR>
    <BR>That said, I must say I have never heard of this annal fixation with the letter
    n. <BR> <BR>So there is several schools of thought. One would be to buy a smaller
    ham, the other would be to cut the ends off the ham, the third would be to buy
    a bigger oven.

  body: In beginning the design of a new typeface, attacking the detailing of a lowercase
    n or any letter for that matter would be of little value to me. My approach is
    not so much methodical, but intuitive. I would leave the finiting of a letter
    like n to later on when I have developed something that is ready to be detailed.
    <BR> <BR>I favour lettering a short word or two in a loose but controlled manner
    until I come up with something that has possibilities. Rather than to carefully
    draft these first letters, my custom in most cases it to more or less &#34;write&#34;
    them using a flat sletch pencil sharpened to a calligraphic edge. That is not
    to say that I am in every case reaching for a calligraphic letter. A lead sharpened
    in this way gives me the form and proportions of the letters I choose to draw.
    <BR> <BR>I am not even certain that I select the same combinations of letters
    for each attempted type, but it seems to me that I make up the letter combinations
    that suit me ad the developing letterforms at the time. <BR>This might seem by
    some to be directionless, but it is the way I work, and it is what I have become
    comfortable with. There are times that I might start out with a lowercase t, and
    the resulting t then tells me what letter I want next to it. When a combinations
    of letters begin to work together, I can think about expanding it to a complete
    set of lowercase. <BR> <BR>I think for the most part in terms of text. It&#39;s
    not that I don&#39;t like to tackle display faces, but I just think of words and
    phrases in composition, and this method of writing forms gives me a direction.
    <BR> <BR>I can accept that my method is &#34;off the wall&#39;&#34; and not the
    best way for everyone to work. Neither is it valueless, because it works for what
    I want to achieve.  <BR> <BR>It is my curse that each time I attack a group of
    letters and it expands into a phrase; all the way through the process I am trying
    to see it under the effects of &#40;letterpress&#41; Impression. I guess you could
    say that I have channel vision, but on the other hand a face done in that way
    need not be focused toward letterpress alone. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa has mention
    the work of Sol Hess and Frederic Goudy, and that they both worked in an ecclectic
    manner. I have read a great deal about Goudy over more than fifty years of interest
    of getting type onto paper, and I can know that Goudy worked in a less than methodical
    way. &#40;if a person can manage it, there is a very comprehensive collection
    of FWG&#39;s work in the Special Collections Dept of the University of Washington
    in Seattle&#41; He could however design freely and quickly, and knew where he
    was going. In one of his writings he noted that he once took direction for a type
    he was going to draw from an ancient printed page, where on letter had a broken
    serif. Goudy saw value in that. It gave him direction. He has also written that
    he once got inspiration from the shape of an i. <BR> <BR>I have never heard of
    n being the first point of departure in the designing of a typeface, but who knows?
    If that works it would be no less bizarre than taking the dot of an i as an examplar.
    To me it seems somewhat rigid, and something that as Giampa has said would perhaps
    be better tackled later on in the process. <BR> <BR>My method is the result of
    forty years or so of comping layouts and designs in pencil, chalk, markers and
    gouache and brush. I do value this past experience for my own purposes. In Adrain
    Wilson&#39;s writings about book design he shows a good many examples of title
    page comping by the above mediums. I visited him some twenty years or more ago
    at this Press In Tuscany Alley in San Francisco, and he gave generously of his
    time an into the bargain, handed me his book as a gift to a visiting printer.
    <BR> <BR>Matheus should ask his typography instructor just why the n is the first
    letter to consider. I would like to know where the theory came from. <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: 'Gerald G: <i>. . .is speaking of final stages of type design. </i> <BR> <BR>I
    should perhaps clarify that I was talking about the <i>making</i> of a typeface,
    not the design of a typeface in more generative or creative phase. When it comes
    time to start making a font, there are benefits to starting with the lowercase
    n, for the reasons outlined above: it is a letter that establishes some common
    norms that can be built on. I agree that &#39;design&#39; precedes this.'
