body: "First actual font (and by that I mean the first one that has made it this far!)\r\n\r\nI
  started this font about three days ago from a sketch of the letter 'a' I did on
  Sunday. At the moment, only lowercase letters have been completed. It's not one
  of those fonts you would set a book in, but it might be useful for the occasional
  heading.\r\n\r\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "this would make a good italic of another font \u2013 something along the
    lines of Joanna and its accompanying italic.\r\n\r\nCouple of things for me: 1.
    the \"t\" crossbar so high really breaks the rhythm when you set it with other
    characters 2. the tilt on the top of the \"k\" & \"b\" have you thought about
    it being straight? "

  body: "Good work. At my own, I find the \u201Ce\u201D and the \u201Co\u201D should
    be less italic compare to the a and the c. I agreed the \u201Ct\u201D crossbar
    is too high"

  body: "Added the caps and some symbols.  \r\n\r\nLowercase looks okay (and I'd be
    happy with it if it was only lowercase), the caps still need a lot of work. I
    don't think they go to well with the lowercase... they almost look too flowery.
    \  \r\n\r\nI've lowered the \"t\" crossbar and adjusted the rotation on the \"o\"
    and the \"e\".\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Fanline2.png"

  body: 'It would be a better idea to post a pdf of your file. Some letters in the
    caps have to be fixed. The crossbar of the J is too large, it looks like the T
    wiht a bottom curve. The H is not wide enough. The top crossbar of the F should
    be more to the right than to the left, the F is almost [but not] an E without
    the bottom bar, the middle bar could be a bit lower than the E one to avoid to
    have a large white space under. I hope this will help you. '

  body: "Here's another revision. \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Fanline.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    have reworked the capitals and fixed some of the kerning. I'm still not liking
    the fact that some lowercase letters such as the \"g\" and the \"y\" clash with
    characters such as the \"h\" and the \"l\" on the line below, but hopefully there
    will be a way to fix that.\r\n\r\nIn the example, you can also see the \"ff\"
    ligature. This was just a bit of testing I was doing, and I forgot it was included
    when I built the font. "

  body: ff ligature is nice..but the kerning between the i & the ff is odd. I would
    watch the spaces..give it a little more room. Also, the dots on the i & j get
    lost in smaller sizes..something to look into maybe?
