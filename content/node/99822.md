    versatile. Mostly how it is now, I do not like myself, because as time passed
    and since then I have learned to make fonts much better. An interesting history
    of the appearance of his name: Cuprum is copper, not gold or silver. Copper is
    too noble, but it is much cheaper and copper is not used for medals \u2013 only

    you would take to heart that virtually nobody can come out of thin air, make something

  body: "Here's the genesis of the \"once\" above:\r\n- I found the numbers for scaling
    the \"n\" from Cuprum to the proportions of the \"n\" from Modena* by using the
    bounding rectangle (minus the top overshoot). For the benefit of anybody who hasn't
    used a font editor much: the horizontal scaling can be achieved with a quick global
    scaling; the vertical is even easier, requiring only a shift in the proportions
    of the Em.\r\n- I used the <em>same numbers</em> to scale all four glyphs.\r\n-
    I then placed each Cuprum glyph on top of the corresponding one from Modena, applying
    a transparency.\r\n\r\n* From the PDF here: http://typophile.com/node/45498\r\n\r\nThere
    really is <em>way</em> too much similarity.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would ask where the
    date of 2006 came from if Modena is from 2008 - and BTW the Dafont release date
    is towards the end of 2008...\r\n\r\nSo the most probable scenario is that you
    did do a good deal of work yourself, but you also did start from Modena's outlines*.
    Maybe to some people, like Jan (and possibly even Miles!) this moves far enough
    away from plagiarism and close enough to \"inspiration\" that it's OK. But when
    you factor in the effort and expertise required to get to Modena <em>first,</em>
    to me that's a convenient escapism.\r\n\r\n* Which you might have gotten not from
    the font but from a PDF... like the one on Typophile!\r\n\r\nAlso, frankly it
    really doesn't matter if you directly used the outlines from Modena. Even if you
    trace a scan/printout, <em>even if you just look at it and try to make a <strong>direct
    variant</strong>*,</em> that's still closer to plagiarism than inspiration in
    my book. And I think most designers of <em>original</em> fonts -the stuff that
    promotes cultural progress as opposed to merely making/saving money- agree with
    that stance.\r\n\r\n* BTW that's how I made my first outline font, Tasagan (although
    that was actually in a pretty generic classical Armenian genre). But at least
    now I admit it, and no longer distribute it.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, like I said,
    I'm concerned with the bigger picture (not merely Cuprum) and the deplorable total
    lack of <em>any</em> desire to protect the very things that give so much pleasure
    to the type ID crowd.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Democratica, which was a cut and paste design, and never felt comfortable about

    the character set, add more weights and gently update DIN-Mittelschrift and make

    original designer. It hasn't stopped others, and I accept that it is OK for them.
