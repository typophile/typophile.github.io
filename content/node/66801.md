  use one of these fonts with Burgues Script for a logo design. Any other ideas for
  fonts to go with this script would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3476.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4121.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5455.jpg]"

  body: "NATIONAL BUILDING.. looks like Engraver's Gothic. \r\n\r\nThe bottom sample
    doesn't come too close to any fonts I can find (the original was probably not
    a digital font, right?), but I though perhaps [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/|Geogrotesque]]
    might have enough weights to allow creating a faux shadow font by layering, and
    to replicate the plain sans type by using a little graphic manipulating to flatten
    or narrow, as needed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
