  have had before and I need help solving it. I can't find the problem on the web.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I copy my glyphs from Illustrator and paste them into FLS the shapes transforms
  from smooth rounded corners into just cornered. In Illustrator the anchor points
  is set to smooth. Why do FLS change my anchor points?\r\n\r\nMy English is to limited
  to explain the problem. Please see the attached images.\r\nThe black and grey image
  is in Illustrator and the white image with a black line is in FLS.\r\n\r\n/\r\nTheapbo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illustrator_CS6_6193.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontLab_Studio_5_4941.png]"

  body: Most likely caused by rounding errors. Make the glyph you're copying from
    illustrator is the same size in points as you want it to be in fontlab.

    neither move or scale the glyphs in FLS.\r\nOr do you mean something else?\r\n/\r\nTheapbo"

  body: How tall are the glyphs once in Fontlab? Can you show the second image again
    with node positions marked?

    in illustrator first, in order to be compatible.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s\r\nhttp://font.is/fontlab-using-illustrator-to-draw-fonts-for-importing-into-fontlab/"

    in Fontlab and in Illustrator.\r\nAfter reading the article and watching the movie
    I made some adjustments and everything looks much better. But not exactly like
    it does in Illustrator.\r\nI will in the future at least consider drawing the
    font directly in Fontlab. \r\n\r\n/\r\nTheapbo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab_dimensions_5679.png]"
