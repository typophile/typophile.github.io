body: "I've been rummaging around the net, in search of a listing of the original
  fonts Letraset published in their catalog back in the early 60s to no avail. Across
  typophile, I found a couple entries, both pointing to a quite useful link, although
  from what I gather, it's from the late 70's...\r\n\r\nAt any rate, and without wanting
