  body: "I searched in Part 14 (Distressed Scripts) of the Script Guide and found
    a few candidates for similar fonts to start with: [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/pious+henry/fonts/|Pious
    Henry]] is one, and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carumba/|Carumba]]
    is another. There were lots of possibilities, but I didn't see this exact font.
    It's hard to know how much massaging it got to end up like your sample.\r\n\r\n-
