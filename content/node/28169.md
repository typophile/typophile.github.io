body: "Hello\r\nI started working on this some time ago. Since I got quite a few of
  the lowercase character draws already in digital form, I really need some feedback
  on the overall characters I got and also on its stroke variations. I'm not sure
  if I still wanna keep the subtle \"uplift\" I got goin on the character \"o\", but
  it was the starting point for all the remaining character's curves.\r\nAnyway, what
  suggestions do you got?\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n"

  body: "Looks good. Can you set some text for us?\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\nc: terminals
    too angled. Either a more gentle curve, or more flat. Flipping the *a* will not
    do. \r\n\r\nr: angled terminal is out of character. Should be flat. Also, differentiate
    from the n. The r shouldn't be an amputated n.\r\n\r\no: to much angled stress
    for my taste. seems out of character.\r\n\r\nq: I'd give it the spike. You're
    going modular, why stop there?\r\n\r\nx: shift the bottom left leg to the left
    slightly. (the whole thing, not just the end)\r\n\r\ny: less gradual hook on the
    tail.\r\n\r\nproportion: a modularly constructed design is good, but you have
    to know where to break out. One place is proportion. m shouldn't = n+n it should
    be narrower. bdpq shouldn't be the same with as nhu etc. u should be a little
    wider than n. This is all with a grain of salt. It will add more *polish* to the
    look. If uber-constructed is what you're going for, ignore.\r\n\r\nGreat job BTW
    on achieving a monoline look by tapering the horizontals.\r\n\r\nRandy"

    body: "Thanks so much for the detailed answer Randy.\r\nI'm still rather new to
      drawing an entire typeface, so you must know how helpful all these comments
      are.\r\nAnyway, being that english isn't my main language I'm rather rusty on
      some more specific terms. \r\n\r\nc: I do agree with you here. It came out with
      such angled terminals mostly cause I was trying to keep the \"o\" curves. Anyway
      I'll review it.\r\n\r\nr: Yeah, you're right. Should I tweak it so that its
      terminal ends up vertical, similar to the lower case \"L\", but a little bit
      longer?\r\n\r\no: True, Im not that  satisfied with the \"o\". I still wanna
      keep the angled stress on it, but I'll probably try a very subtle one. As it
      is now its clearly not working well with some of the characters.\r\n\r\nx: only
      the left bottom leg? or should I move the right bottom leg a little bit to the
      right aswell?\r\n\r\nAnd what do you mean with \"tapering the horizontals\"
      ?\r\n\r\nI'll post some \"words\" later on as soon as I start digitalizing some
      of the upper case characters after I get all the lower case ones fixed and ready
      to go. :)\r\n \r\nBest Regards"

    the horizontals\u201D \r\nNow my english is rusty :-) It is another trick of the
    eye. If you draw a +, the \u2014 should be a little thinner than the | to look
    the same thickness. The same is true in a typeface that is \"monoline.\" all the
    horizontal parts need to be a little thinner. Your font does this very well!\r\n\r\nRandy"
