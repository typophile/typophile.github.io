body: "If you are just starting out designing type, I just picked up this great book
  called <strong>Designing Type</strong> by Karen Cheng. It explains the processes
  behind creating and designing type and provides detailed guidelines for creating
  serif and sans serif letters, numbers, punctuation, and accents. \r\n\r\n\"The book
  is illustrated with numerous diagrams that demonstrate visual principles and letter
  construction, ranging from informal progress sketches to final type designs and
  diagrams. A wide range of classic and modern typefaces is analyzed, including those
  from many premier contemporary type foundaries. Introductory essays and diagrams
  emphasize the history of type, the primary systems of typeface classification, the
  two main proportional systems for type, the parts of a letter, the effects of new
  technology on design methodology, the optical illusions that affect density and
  balance in letterforms, and the differences in form between basic serif typestyles.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/designingtype_5769.jpg]"

    What? She hasn''t published any typefaces? Oh. I guess it''s true what they say:
    Those who can, do. Those who can''t, teach. Those who can''t teach, write books.'
