  body: "I think TEA REVIVES YOU looks like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/toronto-gothic/\">Toronto
    Gothic</a>, a revival by Andrew Leman of what he says was probably Condensed Titling
    Gothic No. 11. He rounded the corners just like your sample, and so I think this
    is the font used. I think the two shorter words were 'squooshed' graphically to
    fit better, but I think they are the same font.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me that
    your second sample is the same font, but it is certainly a similar style. I found
    this one by searching with the terms 'woodtype sans-serif'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
