body: "This is a 'bout of trying to create a logo for my design business. Please,
  ignore the exceedingly stupid 'slogans' under the three ideas I have, they're in
  place for the purpose of taking up where a slogan will/could go.\r\n\r\nQuestions
  I have off the bat:\r\nAre any of them balanced?\r\nWould a different font be better?(I'm
  using PhrasticMedium right now)\r\nDoes it look elementary?\r\nToo cluttered/busy?\r\nWould
  different layouts all together be better to aim at?\r\nWould you(personally) even
  want to look into a business with any of these logos?"

  body: "Yikes! To be frank, the ones with the head look a bit like somebody getting
    the back of his head blown off.\r\nAnd yes, keep looking for a font--this one
    feels dated and, as riccard0 suggested, not playful enough. "

  body: I kind of like the name, but don't care for the way the head is drawn; looks
    too much like a skull. And you might see if it'll work with the head facing right
    instead of left. To me it's "looking" away from the rest of the logo; I'd have
    it facing the logo if possible.
