  says that Typecon 2006 in Boston, MA will be on August 9-13, 2006. \r\n\r\nAnybody

  body: I missed the evening activities this summer cause I wasn't 21 and was only
    volunteering. I know by the time next summer comes I'm going to want to just front
    the money and get the full experience, meet people too!

    I probably can't go in August.

  body: "I attended Typcon 2003 in Minneapolis and loved it. Missed Typcon 2004 as
    I traveled to Baku to celebrate my fiance's and my 2003 engagement with her family.
    Last summer we were busy with our American wedding (after a long two year wait
    for her residency requirement to expire and the immigration process to get her
    over here). Now we are expecting a daughter in mid to late May:)\r\n\r\nSo long
    story short, I don't think I will be at this year's Typcon. I look forward to
    when my wife and I can attend a Typcon together... we made a deal after Typcon
    2003 that the next Typcon I attend she would come with me:) "

    this great site. Just to say I will be travelling over to Typecon as well. really
    looking forward to it as I have not been before. hope to meet and make some friends
    as well as I am going over (I'm Irish) on my own. Should be good to meet people
    who are also self confessed typocondriacs as well:)
