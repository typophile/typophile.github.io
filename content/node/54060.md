  even how to google this topic, so I'm starting a fresh discussion. (If you can find
  an old one to point me to, I'd be glad to read that too) So here's the question:\r\n\r\nWhat
  is a better term (if any) for Non-Latin scripts without using 'non' or 'Latin' to
  qualify them? I typically think of 'other' scripts as 'exotic', but I feel that
  maybe even that is a bit ethnocentric. Is there a solution to this dilemma?"

    \"beyond Latin\", and as 99% of international fonts include basic Latin support,
    maybe \"Latin plus...\" or CP1252+?  \r\n\r\nAlso Adobe doesn't need a phrase
    for this. A cute little shaded icon set in Adobe Gauge is what's needed, right?

    rarely can is that type production and typographic education has been so Latin-centric.

    complain about Latin fonts that are made to look Russian for example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Because of the way in which I work, and the way in which Tiro is organised,
    I'm blessed not to have to worry about such terminology: we do multiscript type
    design, and Latin is just one of the scripts. The relative importance of one script
    over another is project-specific, not part of our general outlook. Sometimes,
    a client needs a typeface in which one script \u2018sets the tone\u2019, as it
    were, for harmonised companions, but we don't have a Latin type department and
    a Non-Latin type department. It is in the latter situation that I think the term
    originated. Traditionally, type manufacturers and typesetters alike, in Europe
    and the Americas, have distinguished between \u2018our typography\u2019 and \u2018everyone
    else's typography\u2019, with the latter sometimes referred to as non-Latin and
    sometimes as exotics.\r\n\r\nHrant, I don't think using the term non-Latin ever
    stopped anyone from Latinising a \u2018non-Latin\u2019 script. Rather, it maintains
    a status quo in which the identity of other writing systems are expressed relative
    to Latin.\r\n\r\nPaul, I would look at it this way: if you find yourself needing
    a term with which to refer to \u2018everyone else\u2019s typography\u2019 maybe
    you need to reorganise the way in which you work. When you lose the need for such
    a term, you can be fairly confident that you are treating the typographic citizens
    of the world as equals."

    characters, I decided to give it a try (not the bundling!)\r\nMy relationship
    with the Greek and Cyrillic scripts has become too intimate for me to think of
    them as \"non-\" anything, they are Greek and Cyrillic. \r\n\r\nAt the ATypI conference
    in St Petersburg, I realized on numerous occasions that many of the Russians I
    was speaking with about type knew far less about the \"exotica\" of Cyrillic than
    I had recently learned, for instance, its history, and non-Russian Cyrillic characters,
    such as the Big Yus that Maxim had persuaded me to include in my fonts--one fellow
    though it was a funny looking Zhe.\r\nAnother young designer thought the 19th
    century form of lower case \"p\", with its forked extenders, was unusable today:
    a good understanding for me to have, but I explained to him that an authentic
