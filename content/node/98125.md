  it, send it in, and get back a font. I think I paid a little for the service. Anyway,
  I've tried to clean it up, but it still looks like it's blotchy from a faulty fountain
  pen as the sizes change , and stroke thicknesses change out of proportion also.
  Any help on how to make this a useable font for personal correspondence is welcome.\r\n\r\nNotes:
  I do intend to use small caps as lower case. That's how i print. And a few glyphs
  may be borrowed since they were not in the form to write - they can be ignored,
  since they are placeholders and will be removed.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample of
  a larger test file. Thanks for any help."

    LC is different from the UC. I tried various optimizations or variations from
    several sample of my printing. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions where I could get some
    help welcome.\r\n\r\nldavidson"

    design corrections are necessary? Also, a better sample would help,as the one
    you uploaded is very low resolution which does not really let us see what the
    problems are up close. '
