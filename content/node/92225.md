body: "Hello. Majev Sans (named by adding vowels to my initials) is my first complete
  (but not completed!) family. It's meant to be an unserifed Aldine, but it came out
  as more of an Optima with an oblique pen angle. It has a prototype serif  \u2013
  Majev Avec \u2013 which I'm posting in the Serif forum.\r\n\r\n"
