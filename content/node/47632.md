  body: "Personally I do my best bits of writing randomly. Sentences come to my mind
    at the most bizarre times and hours. I jot down when they spring to mind, and
    then when I have enough to cover the bulk of what I wish to say, I assemble all
    the bits and start to construct the actual letter. \r\n\r\nThe warning was quite
    humorous. \r\n\r\nJon.  \r\n\r\nP.S. what was the sans serif font used in your
    PDF? For some reason Acrobat won\u2019t let me see the fonts used?!? \r\n"
