  typeface design.\r\nI looked in the wiki but couldn't get a clear idea. I'm looking
  for a book with information on how to start drawing type/typeface; something for
  beginners.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions more than welcome...\r\n\r\nThanks. Marco"

  body: "> Leslie Cabarga\u2019s book Learn FontLab Fast is essential if you are using
    FontLab, and his Logo, Font and Lettering Bible is also very informative. (from
    the referred thread).\r\n\r\nI have to vouch for these books. I just got them,
    and recently finished reading the latter, and have browsed the former extensively.
    They are absolutely the best resources I have seen for beginning type design.
    (Note: they expect you to have mastered Illustrator or another vector program
    first)."
