Things can be taken too far and perfected to please the in-crowd, but I think readability is mostly subliminal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just for example, a magazine I've seen for years did a slight redesign a few months back. There was just a little more leading in the body copy, same font, same point size. I noticed it because they had also changed the headline font and some rules along the sides of the body copy. I showed it to my wife and she said she had particularly enjoyed that issue and read it more thoroughly than usual, and felt it was easier reading somehow but couldn't put her finger on it. So small things can make a difference without being highly noticeable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's a short answer: obviously no one cares as evidenced by the amount of comic sans being used anywhere and everywhere.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interestingly, if you continue the WAD essay quoted by Kris, you'll find he goes on to say: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;By a remarkable paradox the one person who should not be called upon to perceive the fine qualities of the shapes of letters is the person who reads them. The person who reads printing should not be conscious that the page he reads is made up of letters. If any single character presents itself to his attention <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a single character, the process of reading is disturbed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The kind of letter to which a reader is accustomed is the best kind of letter for the reader. But this fact must not be allowed to limit the effort of the designer toward better design. If the reader is used to bad design, he must be led to accustom himself to better design. It is at this point that the printer enters the equation.[*] However little attention the reader needs to pay to the design of letters, it is obviously most necessary that the person who makes printing should be able to criticise and assess the qualities of letter forms.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Keep in mind that when this was written (1919), there wasn't yet a clearly distinct profession of &quot;graphic designer&quot; separate from the printer/compositor.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I guess in turn I could be misinterpreting Warde; but from what I gather the &quot;must not&quot; comes from the &quot;cannot&quot;: the supposition is that a text font that tries to be expressive is no longer a text font. In the superficial, conscious meaning of &quot;expressive&quot; I might actually agree, but I can't be so dismissive of the receptiveness of the subconscious to visual stimuli. For example, I believe the shapes of the serifs in Charter versus Times make a difference in the mood they convey, but certainly Warde and company would consider both text faces. In truth, to me Times is actually less of a text face! But Warde (and maybe even Morison) could never see that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there's the issue of whether a human being can totally avoid expressing himself - in whatever small way. Sure, formalizing the expression and making it explicit leads away from Craft and towards Art, but when the creator and the consumer of something are both human, how can expression not be an ingredient? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Pat, to add something to Kris and Hrant's earlier replies, I think not only does the average bear not notice the typography in a logo or product, but will deny that it's responsible for that good/bad change. I think you'll sooner get &quot;No, the colour is slightly different&quot; or &quot;The type is the same, they're just using nicer paper&quot; than &quot;Yeah, they really messed up by leading this solid.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Crystal Goblet. I always understood this meaning that for clear communication when setting type, make sure that it is relevant to the intrinsic inner logic of the 'text'. I never understood it as meaning &quot;plain = good&quot;, I just thought she was warning against making it stupid, like setting a verse of poetry in Sand. It is impossible to not not communicate, and I find that I agree with Hrant about the subtle mood that any type will convey, even if it is supposedly for &quot;text&quot;. Maybe I misunderstood Mrs Warde! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kris.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It is impossible to not not communicate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was scrolling down this page with these exact words bouncing around im my head. I only read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crystal Goblet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just now, despite lecturers continually going on about it (the general idea of the text, although valid, always seemed sort of pompous to me). Coming from more of a fine arts than a technical background, I always feel a bit disappointed and cheated when people describe designers as just a conduit for others' information. Personally I think it's impossible for me to design something without some form of creative self-expression.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I suppose since no-one ever really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thinks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about type, it's hard for someone out of the typographic loop to credit or blame type for a good or bad design.</div>
