body: "Ian Lyman and Craig Mod have ginned up a <a href=\"http://craigmod.com/journal/font-face/\">Webfonts
  test page</a> that uses genu-wine fonts from Underware. But very special fonts they
  are: \u201CAll of the type on this page was kindly licensed by Underware for specific
  use in this @font-face demo, as commissioned by the Mozilla foundation. With Underware's
  approval, we created glyph-limited editions of some of their typefaces for this
  one-time use only.\u201D One-offs seem to be inimical to the entire concept of Webfonts,
  but we\u2019re still at the demonstration-project stage, so I\u2019m not all that
  surprised.\r\n\r\nBut! What\u2019s the kicker? Everybody\u2019s favourite curmudgeon
  Mark Pilgrim, he of \u201C<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/04/21/f%75%63%6B-the-foundries\">Fornicate

  Delicious</a>): \u201C[Hundreds] of open-source fonts, and they go out of their
  way to license proprietary alternatives.\u201D Because typography, like information,
  wants to be free!"

    fonts, and despite the fact that the custom one-off solution won't scale, this
    move reinforces that fact.   "
