  body: "Isn't type important with EVERY type of propaganda?? Surely, the typeface
    needs to be supportive to what is written, i.e. it needs to support the message
    the propaganda is trying to get across.\r\n\r\nIn other words, an election poster
    of the NSDAP would not have worked, had they used something like Scriptina :-)
    But the same goes for the KPdSU. In fact, it goes for any kind of info."

    When a regime wants to suppress a group, one of the weapons it uses is banning
    that group''s cultural expressions (some examples are France''s ban of the burqa
    and Taliban-era Afghanistan''s ban of most secular music). Fraktur types were
    widely used in Germany until the Third Reich banned them in 1941 because it believed
    these faces had Jewish origins. '

    to learn about type?

    a new national typeface?

  body: "Nick, how can you say that when the Nazis explicitly endorsed blackletter,
    and then explicitly denounced it?\r\n\r\nWhy the attraction? Simple: rarely has
    type played such a big and explicit role in politics.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well, when you start from a style of printing, Fraktur, which everyone else
    finds very hard to read, you have to devote <em>some</em> attention to that to
    engage in propaganda activities, even if you devalue typography in general.

    I'm also surprised at the variety of colors used. I would have expected mostly
    red and black like the flag.\r\n\r\n> Fraktur types were widely used in Germany
    until the Third Reich \r\n> banned them in 1941 because it believed these faces
    had Jewish origins.\r\n\r\nThat was the reason given to the public, but Hitler
    had mentioned his dislike of Fraktur typeface several years before it was banned,
    stating that it looked outdated to him. "

    evidence that Hitler wasn't the only player. It's just convenient to demonize
    one person instead of seeing deeper problems. You can't run a war with a single
    sick looney.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "I would dare to disagree - there are a large number of wars where \"one
      sick looney\" was all it needed. Just think of the Conquest of England in 1066
      - William II was the one and only reason for all of it. Or think of the Napoleonic
      wars - it was Napoleon who caused it, and he was the one who gave the orders.
      And so on.\r\n\r\nYes, there are always \"supporters\", there are always those
      that follow the orders. But there is always this one charismatic person who
      is in command and in control. He is \"the cause\". All the others are those
      that either want to - or believe to have no choice (usually because of fear).\r\n\r\n"
