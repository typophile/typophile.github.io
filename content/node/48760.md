  Care'\r\nI thought that the top words looked like avenir but it wasn't fat enough
  and then I thought the tag underneath looked like syntax but the \"a's\" are different.
  \ Does anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThe second one is the american trucking
  company and i didnt have any ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know these aren't exciting
  but i just need to recreate them. Thanks."
