  body: It looks an awful lot like Aachen, but it has obviously been manipulated.
    I don't think the face comes in an outline form, but should be easy enough to
    do in Photoshop.

  body: "Egyptienne SB from Scangraphic seems pretty similar too.\r\n\r\n[Edit: Make
    that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/egyptienne-bq/\">Egyptienne
    BQ</a>. I think maybe the new FontBook had that font mislabeled. There doesn't
    seem to be a Scangraphic version I can find (at least at MyFonts), but the Berthold
    version looks like the sample shown on page Slab 15 in FontBook.]\r\n\r\n- Mike
