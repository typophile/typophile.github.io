body: "As a project, I'm putting together a sort of code scrapbook, a small bound
  book with interesting excerpts of code from my work and small bits of prose about
  the code. I've been looking for font families that could supply both a serif typeface
  for paragraphs of text, a sans for captions next to the code, and a monospace font
  for the code itself. As you might expect, the set of font families with a well built
  monospace cut are very few. In fact I've managed to track down just two:\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nQuadraat:\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.6180.1.5\">Serif</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&displayfontid=FF.10989.0.0\">Sans</a>,
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11188.1.5\">Monospace</a>\r\n\r\nThesis:\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/theserif/serif-.html\">Serif</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesans/sans-.html\">Sans</a>,
  and <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesansmo/sansmo-.html\">Monospace</a>\r\n\r\nQuadraat
  might be a bit too mannered for this project. Thesis might be a bit too femine.
  Ideally there would be a monospaced version of Freight Micro since the rest of the
  family feels just right. I'll probably end up using Quadraat since the monospace
  works better in my eyes than TheSans Mono, but I'm still interested to know if there
  are more families out there with a monospace cut. Anyone know?"

    body: Good call on Lucida. I'd seen the monospace cut but hadn't remembered it.
      I must have Lucida fatigue though from staring at it all day in OS X.

    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11162.1.10\">Sans</a>,

    href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_serif_a/\">Serif</a>, <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_sans/\">Sans</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_mono/\">Monospace</a>\r\n\r\nAll
    the settings I can see online of Eureka mono have the letterspacing cranked up
    which makes me think the wide setting is built into the font. This make me a little
    suspicious that it won't look so hot at a more normal letterspacing. Fedra looks
    more mature, as it should I suppose since it could reasonably be called Eureka
    2.0.\r\n\r\nWhat I haven't been able to find at all is a well executed monospace
    font derived from a serifed design. Every well done monospace typeface is at heart
    a sans."

    Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew character sets were redrawn by John Hudson; it may
    only have four weights, but they'll golden ;-)   )
