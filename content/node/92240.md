body: "On some sheet music that my orchestra is doing (we're including some film classics
  in this concert, we normally do completely classical... which I prefer, to be honest),
  I saw this nice type. I'm unsure of its origin, seeing the irregularities in the
  third and fourth \"As\" (left leg/crossbar junction, left crossbar tip) and the
  \"T\" and \"U\" (irregularities), so I'm wondering if this header was actually hand-drawn.
  Does anyone recognize it (it's quite possibly obvious to most of you awesome type
  pros!)\r\n\r\nThanks! -Joe"

  body: The title appears to have been made with a lettering template; in this particular
    instance, it appears that the pen nib or reservoir may have run out of ink during
    the tracing of a few characters.

    body: '@Oldnick Thanks, sort of a stencil? Part of it may be the age of the sheet
      music so the ink is distressed somewhat. If it''s not an actual typeface that
      you know of I may try to fill in the missing characters and make it one for
      the general good, it''s a pretty good-looking face in my opinion.'

    and turn it into a display font, for kicks, who knows.
