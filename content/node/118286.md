body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to do a repaint of different Qatar Airways' Boeing
  aircraft and each of these has got its own name. Being from Europe I am having a
  hard time getting those names written.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me getting the following
  name 'Alhuwalla' done properly, preferably  as an AI vector file or something similiar?
  Does someone recognize the font or has a font which looks pretty similiar?\r\n\r\nHere's
  an example image of what I am talking about:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/garretml/3458709918/sizes/o/in/photostream/\r\n\r\nIf
  possible I'd like to ask for further names to be done.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nChristian\r\n\r\n"

    to do it for free. I myself do believe in giving out ideas freely, but when it
    comes to producing something tangible I don't agree with freebies for peers (only

    the other hand that means I am creating something 'tangible' - not the best term
    you choose there - and I am not charging for it either.\r\n\r\nI was simply asking
    for a word written in a language I don't speak. If somebody would ask me to type
    the words 'Hello world' in Illustrator with Arial and create a file I wouldn't
    even start thinking about charging money for it.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up,  I don't
    share your attitude and the question about contacting you is solved!"

    levels.\r\n\r\nIt's not just about making a few dollars; I feel we each have a
    responsibility to others to maintain value in our respective fields.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious, what's your rationale for doing this work for free? Qatar Airways needs
    the money?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "These repaints are for a flight simulator add on and are normally offered
    for free to the community which is quite large. I bet most graphic artist would
    charge money for such work, quite a few people don't including me.\r\n\r\nI am
    not creating these repaints for Qatar Airways or any other airline. Nor am I affiliated
    with them. I am working on these in my free time and my real profession is a complete
    different one.\r\n\r\nI am trying to get as much detail into those repaints and
    would love to get those names right, I thought at least somebody could draw or
    set those letters who is more into the symbology than I am. It does't even need
    to be the exact same font or require much work. Just something which appears right
    at the first glance.\r\n\r\nSince you seem to have lots of expertise you probably
    can enlighten me why it's so much more work than simply writing 'Hello World'?\r\n\r\nIf
    I am taking completely wrong assumptions feel free to tell me where I am wrong
    so I can at least learn a bit and get my expectations right."

  body: "Thanks for the explanation.\r\n\r\nI myself don't have a lot of Arabic fonts
    installed, so finding just the right one would take time. If you're picky. I am.\r\n\r\nSome
    help I can provide freely: in that image it actually says \"lahweela\" (or \"lahuwayla\").
    If it's supposed to say \"alhuwalla\" (but where's the \"y\"?) the initial alef
    is missing; here are strings (the first without the alef, the second with) that
    you can copy-paste into software and try your luck:\r\n\r\n\u0644\u062D\u0648\uFEF3\uFEDF\uFE94\r\n\r\n\u0627\u0644\u062D\u0648\uFEF3\uFEDF\uFE94\r\n\r\nAnother
    bit of help: that genre of Arabic font is called \"kufi\".\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/HasanAbuAfash--HasanHiba-2007.jpg\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and your strings look absolutely fine in my eyes.  The kufi genre is a good direction
    to start.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. :-)"
