    broad. Perhaps focus on a particular period in time, country, designer or studio."

  body: I really think you should try to narrow your focus a bit. It's kind of like
    trying to write about the use, effect, and value of acting in movies. Maybe think
    of a particular era of graphic design that interests you, or a particular type
    of design (books, posters, something).

    advice for focusing research topics. See their book <em>The Craft of Research</em>,
    or their edition (7th) of Kate Turabian, <em>A Manual for Writers</em>. '

  body: "Graphic design without type suggests an approach.\r\nEither by removing type
    from various media (one artist has done that with street scenes), or \"beyond
    language\" infographics (eg airplane emergency instructions).\r\nThere are grey
    areas that may shed some light on the purpose of type in graphic design, on the
    border line between a text message and an icon--compare No.19 and 20 here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/001009.php\r\n\r\nAlso
    related, Adobe's switch from icons to letters for their Creative Suite GUI links,
    which appears to be bucking the trend.\r\nThere's some interesting theory behind
    the Apple interface, which I touched on in an article on OS X:\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/Writing/DeeperIn.pdf\r\n"

  body: 'yeah your topic is way too broad. think of some use of type that you find
    fascinating, think about why that is, and delve deeper. the narrower, the better.
    then you''ll find a context for it (broaden your scope), but you need to come
    to a narrower and more exciting (to you) topic first. '
