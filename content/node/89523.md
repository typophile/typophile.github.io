  body: "This should be included in the genre list at FontShop for 'curve-to-corner'
    soft sans, but unfortunately it is not. It's close to Foco from TypeTogether,
    but not the same. I'll keep looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Searching for 'soft sans-serif' at MyFonts came up with something pretty
    close: <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-6BxnsK\">Morabira Doomsday Base</a> from
    a Malaysian foundry. It's not exact, but if necessary, some tweaking would get
    you pretty close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
