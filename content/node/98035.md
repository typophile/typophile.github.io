body: "Could someone explain how the new Contour / Interpolate / Horizontal  in fl
  5.2 is supposed to work? I assume this is some sort of a stopgap for intermediate
  MM instances. In particular, I am trying to find a better way of doing mid ranged
  font instances in a MM font with a wide MM range.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJdooley"
