body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like to create a script \"font\", based on a really nice
  handwriting. \r\n\r\nThe pencil created a unique texture which I would like to keep.
  This, to my understanding, prevents me from using outline font formats.\r\nMonochrome
  bitmap fonts (e.g. bdf don't recreate that texture all to well, so I would like
  to know, <em>how could I create a grayscale bitmap font</em>, compatible with most
  applications.\r\n\r\nFontlab's <a href=\"http://www.photofont.com/\">Photofont</a>
  does what I want and more (e.g. full color), but it requires plugins, as it is a
  non-standard format.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse my ignorance. <em>Fontlab doesn't seem
  to support grayscale fonts</em> (only monochrome bitmaps), is that correct?\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\na typographic grasshopper"

  body: Fontforge does support grayscale bitmaps. However be prepared to encounter
    some bugs, as the feature seems to be rarely used, so that the developer doesn't
    pay very much attention to it.

  body: "When you add a bitmap strike to a fontforge file, you can specify the desired
    bit depth. For example, adding 19@8 to the list of strikes will produce a 19 pixels
    bitmap with 256 shades of gray.\r\n\r\nBTW fontforge allows to generate various
    bitmap formats, not just BDF. I actually think TTF with embedded bitmaps may be
    better for your purposes.\r\n"

    it may be as \"standard\" as anything related to bitmap fonts. If there was a
    better way, I think they would be doing it. What specific OS and OS version were
    you planning to use? What applications?"

  body: Grayscale bitmaps is a part of the standard TrueType/OpenType specification.
    If they meet someone's requirements, then there is just no need to look for something
    more special. I think Photofont is intended for more complicated tasks.

  body: "<strong>anagnost:</strong> so, i managed to get 8bit bdf's out of fontforge
    (yey!). Thing is, ttf's don't work (\"no glyphs were exported\"). Photofont, I
    agree, it's to fancy for this.\r\n\r\n<strong>canderson:</strong> the font is
    intended as a \"gift\" of sorts for a friend. It's his handwriting. It will be
    used mostly on macs, with as many apps as possible (i.e. not necessarily meant
    for print). I'd like to us it in Adobe Flash too (not sIFR).\r\n\r\nAt this point
    I'm really heading for vector."
