body: "My first post here. I had already graduated from college when I discovered
  graphic design. I've been trying to soak up as much information as possible on my
  own, and I would really appreciate feedback. Please destroy as much as you want.\r\n\r\nThese
  are ideas for cards for my business (an economics firm). They want a general thank
  you card, which would be used for our clients, primarily colleges and workforce
  boards. As a bit of explanation, the flourishes on the card with the thank you in
  the bottom left corner are supposed to be turning into wheatfields (my company is
  located in a very wheat-ish part of the country).\r\n\r\nPreferences? Do none of
  them work? What tweaking should I do? Oh, and I just noticed that I never fixed
  the serifs on the bottom of the Y in the calligraphic card. Heh.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    My favorite would have to be the second one (turquoise background) lovely Type
    treatment! :) Try to play around with that one some more \r\n-Take care. "

    subdued organic colors? And Can you extend the tail of the y?  I think this is
    wonderful. Just ignore me if you do not agree. Good job!\r\n\r\nEdit: No, great

  body: Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate your comments. I've been working on
    tweaking the first one by changing the bottom of the card to a soft brown, and
    the flourishes to white. When I'm happy with it, I'll post a revision.

  body: "I like both one and two.\r\n\r\nNumber one needs some work though. I like
    your idea about the brown bottom and reversed text. Right now it's a little too
    stark between the black the green and the gold color. Although, if you do color
    the bottom brown it may lose some of the charm that the letters forming the hills
    brings. What if you just made the text brown and changed the green and gold in
    the hills to be a little more natural looking? The green, at least is a little
    too bright and neon-like for me.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that bothers me about
    number one is the contrast between the sans-serif font and the swashes forming
    the hills. I'd suggest making the swashes start thicker from the letter forms
    and gradually thin as they go. I'd also suggest experimenting with some serif
    fonts like garamond or caslon to see if that would look any more natural with
    the swashes. Perhaps even taking similar letter forms from number two would work
    well here.\r\n\r\nTwo needs a little work on the letter forms - refining the swashes
    and serifs, etc. It's nice letter-work, though number one may fit the bill better
    for your company.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to see your revisions.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Alright, here's a revision on the first card. I ended up reworking the flourishes
    so that (hopefully) the card is simpler. When I tried a serif font, I agreed with
    you, pennANDink&#151;it looked much more appropriate. I also tried brightening
    up the colors...although I confess I have an inordinate fondness for unsaturated
    hues.\r\n\r\nTwo versions here, one with brown on the bottom and one without.
    I think I prefer the simplicity of the first card, and that the concept is more
    understandable, but I would love to hear feedback.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thankyou_card_6087.jpg]"

    maybe the bottom of the second one looks heavy as I look again.. Either one wins.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I did thicken up the lines on the bottom one so they would stand out more.
    Maybe I should tone that down a bit. I should probably print it off to make sure
    (major shortcoming of mine...I always forget to print things off until the last
    minute). Sweetness. I think I'm just about satisfied with this one.

  body: "Big improvement. I like either of them. \r\n\r\nThere is, however, still
    something funky with the swashes. They don't flow well out of the letter forms
    and the varying thickness around the top of the brown hills throws me off. Some
    of them also aren't a consistent size in relation to the white stroke over green
    or yellow hill they're forming. Work on continuity and flow and refining the shape
    of the swashes so they look more natural.\r\n\r\npenn\r\n\r\np.s. I didn't know
    kids were saying \"way cool\" again. "

  body: "Two and Three are my favorites. \r\n\r\nNumber 3  has a simple, but sophisticated
    feel associated with a more wealthy clientelle. I don't know if that's the type
    of impression you're going for though. Also in number 3 I would say the Bickham
    setting seems a bit weak for the space.\r\n\r\nI like the playful and more trendy
    look of 2. I would maybe play up some of the various elements a bit more. I would
    lower the crossbar of A some and fix the serif at the top to match other. The
    tapered strokes going on adds a nice touch and maybe worth exploring playing that
    up more. Also\u2026 since you are already mixing other styles in a bit as in your
    O and at least in parts elsewhere; you might try a version of N with thinner verticals
    so you can build up a better contrast where it shoots through the H. \r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "Thank so much for the help, everyone. I'll be working on revising the second
    and third versions soon. I've never done custom lettering before, so I might try
    starting off the second card with calligraphy (since I've dabbled in it for quite
    a while), and then vectorizing it (is that actually a word?). \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
    on things I should watch out for with the letters? I know my serifs are pitiful,
    so if there's a method for working out good ones, please enlighten me. Maybe I
    should warm up by creating an avatar so I don't look quite so...raw.\r\n\r\nGood
    thing I really like letters, because I have the strange feeling I'm going to be
    staring at them for mind-numbingly long periods of time in the near future.\r\n\r\nCheers."
