body: "Hi there.\r\n\r\nThe company I work for has recently chosen to use Officina
  in all branding.\r\n\r\nWe have purchased the standard family package but this didn't
  include a light weight. \r\n\r\nThe problem we have come across is that the only
  light version of Officina I can find is a Display cut which does differ from the
  original, especially the serif I which is important as this letter is in our name.
  \r\n\r\nIs there another light version out there which I have missed.\r\n\r\nThanks
  Jon "
