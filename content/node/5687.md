body: This is the font used by Virgin Mobile throughout their packaging &amp; identity.
  Any ideas on what this could be? I thought it might be Clarendon bold italic, but

    with <i>Look-Look</i> magazine, I think. Although it&#39;s a different typeface,
    their logotype features the same kind of giant slab faux 1960s faux 1890s L: <BR><a
