  body: "There are at least 2 fonts in your sample.\r\n\r\n\"ILUSTRADO DE ALAGOAS\"
    looks close to <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/erasmus-rr/|Erasmus
    Light]]</strong> (or Medium) by Pat Hickson (Red Rooster, 1993).\r\nMyFonts.com
    notes about this font:\r\n<blockquote>Based on the Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos design,
    Amsterdam Foundry circa 1923.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe rest of text looks close
    to <strong>[[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/claire-news/light|Claire
    News Light]]</strong>\r\nThe Monotype site says \"Design foundry Unknown\" but
    in other sites I see this font as:\r\n\"Claire News CG Light\" - Copyright (c)
    Miles Inc.,1992\r\nThe \"Claire News\" is also close to Clarendon (it actually
    looks like a \"primitive\" Clarendon).\r\n\r\nYour text looks as a pre-digital
    era sample, so if you can reveal more details about it (like publisher, year,
    etc) I'm sure there are people in here with much more knowledge than me to point
    you to the right direction."
