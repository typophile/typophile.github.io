body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've got a bit of time on my hands at the moment and am
  seriously considering giving type design another shot. My previous attempts (2 years
  ago) have resulted in nothing special, and the software I was using (fontforge)
  was frustrating to install and use. In particular, the lack of compatibility between
  Illustrator and fontforge got the better of me, and I came to the conclusion that
  it was just too much trouble to be worth it.\r\n\r\nI've been toying with the idea
  of giving either Glyphs or Typetool a shot (Typetool in particular seems a good
  cheap option, as I am a member of University faculty). \r\n\r\nHowever, the interface
  of Glyphs seems much more friendly, and, even though it is more expensive, seems
  more integrated with the Mac environment.\r\n\r\nI'm curious as to what people's
  thoughts are. Should I be giving fontforge another shot, or is it just too worrisome
  to deal with? Would Glyphs or Typetool be more appropriate for someone with no training
  in type design and someone who isn't going to pursue it professionally?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  your feedback would be appreciated!"

    be frustrating at times but it is a very powerful tool and working with it, against
    it and through it will ultimately teach you a lot in the process.\r\n\r\nI primarily
    use FontLab and FontForge to work on type. I have heard good things about Glyphs,
    but there are more detailed overviews elsewhere on this site. Personally I like
    working in FL, of which TypeTool is a basic version, so for straightforward type
    design it should give you everything you need."

    when you're developing software you have to start somewhere, and most people who
    pay for type design software (if not most people who design type) are on Macs,
    so it just makes business sense. If/when a software becomes successful enough,
    it ends up being ported; when you see a successful software that's only available
    on one platform, then you can start suspecting fascism.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Glyphs seems pretty successful to me.  Maybe that's just because of my point
    of view. I emailed the creator of glyphs and begged him to release it on PC.  He
    told me no, flat out.  Not maybe if/when, blah blah blah.  Just flat out no.

    type design software on a mac before I would release it for a PC."

    on the other hand, show some character flaws, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n"

    and inner workings of Glyphs lean heavily on Mac OS X native code libraries, and
    as such it's impossible to make a straightforward Windows \"build\".\r\nOther
    than, for example, FontForge -- a self contained package, as witnessed by yrs
    trly when I needed to download literally <em>hundreds</em> of \"supporting\" libraries
    just to be able to build it! (And then observe, \"gosh it's good but too fugly
    to work with\"...)\r\n\r\nSo I don't think Georg has a hidden agenda here; he's
    a great programmer of <em>Mac</em> software."

    a nice Fontforge package where one simply has to click through the installer,

    ported to another OS (sometimes by hiring other people to do it and/or rewriting

    of Glyphs is due to OS X's interface options. It's <em>possible</em> to emulate
    that from scratch for other OS'es, but certainly no mean task.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>..

    portion of the allocated budget would disappear just to get \"semi-transparant
    pop-up windows\", it's not commercially viable. Or else Windows users would complain
    their version costs more.\r\n\r\n(It's not a one-way problem, by the way. Software
    I wrote myself that utilize Windows' GUI needs so much re-writing that I'd better
    start them from scratch. But  these programs run just fine in VirtualBox on my
    Mac, so there is no need to.)"
