  have been taking interns in on a semi-regular basis now and one of the first things
  I try and teach them is how to make a handwritten typeface based on their writing
  style. It seems like a natural way to get someone into the craft. They start to
  notice why things like consistency plays a big part in making a font, etc.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0276|Dapper]]
  is one of those experiments by Peter Bekke. A very simple but well-drawn alphabet.
  \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0275|Memoriam]] is a typeface
  commissioned by the New York Times magazine. It is a headline script and is a solid
  font through and through. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0274|Inmate]]
  is a casual stencil font with the essence of Eurostile black. It comes with 2 styles.
  Inmate One is a more traditional style stencil, but Inmate Two is the look of future
  of space military styling. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0273|Michel]]
  is an experimental handset font designed by the random, untamed flow of ink carried
  by water across paper. The letters become removed from their traditional appearance
  and take on a surrealistic nature that makes each one its own unique form. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0271|Mousse
  Script]] is based on Glenmoy, a 1932 Stephenson Blake typeface. Improved and brought
  back by the amazing Alejandro Paul. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0270|Player]]
  is the official typeface of sports. You can't watch a sporting event without seeing
  this typeface being used in some way. Essential. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time and
  let us know if you have any suggestions or feedback! \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com\r\n"
