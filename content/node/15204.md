body: "There's something I've wondered aloud about for a while now, although\r\napparently
  never in the right place; but now that David Berlow seems\r\nto hang out here, this
  might be my best chance yet:\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the Poynter typeface
  a few years ago, FontBureau\r\napplied the idea of weight \"grading\", although
  they graciously credited past\r\ndesigners for the idea (too much credit deferred,
  as far as I'm concerned).\r\nThe idea is to provide very gentle weight variations
  to allow fine-tuning,\r\ndepending on printing conditions, specifically in terms
  of gain, which can\r\nhappen even within a single newspaper, for example when type
  is next to\r\nan image or not.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering about is how this idea
  relates to the \"traditional\"\r\nscaling of vertical & horizontal proportions within
  a family of weights,\r\nsince the intent is really different here. Most tellingly,
  at FB itself there\r\nseems to have been a bit of inconstance about this. Here are
  a couple of\r\noverlays, based on scans from their super specimen book:\r\n\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/poynter_1vs4.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/bureau_0vs4.gif\r\n\r\nNote
  how the height changes in one, but not the other.\r\nMy guess is that -since Bureau
  came later, and I think\r\nmore under the hand of Berlow as opposed to TFJ- the\r\nsecond
  attempt was an improvement. But all ears are\r\ntuned to the horse's mouth of course!

  body: "I don't think it's a bad idea to increase the x-height as a font gets bolder.
    I noticed a long time ago that some font families are designed this way and I've
    done it myself on some of mine.\r\n\r\nIt's one of those typographic optical illusions
    to compensate for, though it seems less universally done than, say, using the
    visual center or overshooting curves.\r\n\r\nAs you make a font bolder, the lowercase
    will appear smaller relative to the caps, probably because the counters get smaller
    faster in the lowercase than in the caps as you add weight. If you increase the
    x-height a little, you can compensate for this. The main drawback is if you want
    to set two lowercase characters of different weights right next to each other,
    and they don't line up. For this reason, I think it's up to the type designer
    to decided whether or not to do it, depending on how the font is expected to be
    used."

  body: "Grades started for me with the development of a Playboy Baskerville. There
    was a man there who wanted the type to look the same regardless of where the flesh
    lay, so to speak. I.E. they use offset for non-naked people pages and gravure
    for those rich skin tone we've all come to know and dismiss in favor of reading.
    When Poynter began, we had lots of discussions about grades and what they meant
    in execution. If you are combating weight gain or weight loss in the production
    process you could think to erode or accrete in all directions, including below
    the baseline. But tests showed this not to be effective. In the end, Tobias and
    I had two different approaches to x-height but they are not \"That\" different
    that either of us went too far, or not far enough. I decided to keep all the heights
    the same because that ht. makes such a huge impact, he allowed a slight rise...\r\n\r\nP.S.
    after 3-4 months of truly minute changes to PB Baskerville that did not seem to
    be making the hutch happy, I got a letter that said \"I'm sorry to take so long,
    but I finally realized the fonts are fine, I needed new glasses \u2014 Hef\""
