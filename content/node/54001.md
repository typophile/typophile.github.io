  body: The only thing that comes to mind is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/utopia_complete_virtual/|Utopia]].
    According to Christian's explanation the DB Serif is influenced by Garamond and
    Sabon, but the serifs are almost a slab serif, so it's a unique typeface.

  body: Although they aren't really that similar (particularly in x-height), Fournier
    approximates the "look and feel" of DB Serif Regular quite closely. The italic
    reminds me a bit of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/dante|Dante]]'s.
