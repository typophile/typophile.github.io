body: I am a typography student and my teacher has tasked me with identifying a font
  on a flash card (imaged attached). I used identifont.com and saw that it is very
  similar to ITC Honda which was created in the 1970s. My teacher said that the font
  on the flash card is a metal type and ITC Honda was probably based on it. Does anyone
  know what the name of the metal type on my flash card?  Thank you to whoever can
  help me identify it!!!! - Laura

    get close with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/honda/">ITC Honda</a>.

    would want you to be able to identify a metal face. I mean, coming up with the
    currently available alternative should be a satisfactory answer. \r\n\r\nI put
    the search for the original name into the \"wild goose chase\" category."

  body: It's probably way too late, Laura, but I may have caught that "wild goose".
    Whilst looking for something else, I came across a partial showing of an old metal
    type called Valiant. It matches up much closer that Honda. I don't think that
    a digital version exists and I can't find a showing online. Still, if it's NOT
    too late, see if the typeface name Valiant gets you a gold star in class.

    of the Twentieth Century' and this sample is exactly Valiant. It was designed
    in 1940 for Monotype by Edwin W. Shaar.\r\n\r\nGood eye Mike (once again)!\r\n\r\n-
