  was surprised to find very little information on-line.

  body: "If you're talking about 4 fonts only that are B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4?\r\n\r\nThese
    are Filmotype fonts that were given letters & numbers by VGC when they pirated
    a substantial number of them. Their original names were attached by someone going
    through a dictionary and just picking arbitrary words for Filmotype fonts that
    were initially just letters and numbers also. When and where I haven't the vaguest
    idea. But for Typositor operators there was always a haphazard list that you had
    to find out which was which when you bought from VGC. \r\n\r\nB-1 = Galaxy\r\nB-2
    = Gable\r\nB-3 = Garfield\r\nB-4 = Gamma\r\n\r\nThere is a complete listing of
    the VGC letter/numbers = Filmotype names in the Babel Press Type Index which I
    am still trying to print. \r\nI have found out that (digital) printers want to
    print so fast that the quality goes down. So far, I have been unable to get this
    straight."

  body: I just learned about the Bee series at <a href="http://www.posterwire.com/archives/2005/03/21/poster-credits-font/">Posterwire</a>,
    a site dedicated to movie poster design. I'm pretty sure they're different than
    the series of typefaces mentioned by philippedada. I too would like to know their
    history, and how close they come to challenging Univers's dominance.

    the Bee that we purchased. The version we bought is from URW. They have a pdf
    of Bee One at:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.urwpp.de/common/pdffiles/b040012t.pdf\">Bee
    One from URW</a>"

  body: FWIW, the URW Bee fonts do appear to match the ones listed in the Solotype
    catalog as Galaxy, Gable, Garfield, and Gamma.
