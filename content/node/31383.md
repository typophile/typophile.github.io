body: "Hi all-\r\nI'm trying to help a friend who adopted a system\r\nunfamiliar to
  them. They're having two similar problems.\r\n\r\nAn OpenType font they purchased
  is not working. They \r\nopen it in Font Book but they're getting some kind of \r\npostscript
  error when trying to print. As a test, I gave\r\nthem an alternate font to see if
  that worked and FontBook\r\nonly enables some but not all of the styles in that
  font.\r\nBoth work fine on my computer.\r\n\r\nI have been through everything: dumping
  other versions \r\nof it in other folders, repairing permissions, quitting apps\r\nbefore
  opening fonts, restarting. To no avail.\r\n\r\nThe ONE difference between us is
  that I'm on 10.4.3 because \r\nI heard there were font problems in 10.4.7. They
  are running\r\n.8. I suggested they re-install the original version of Tiger\r\nbut
  they're afraid to do it. They don't have an easy backup method.\r\nNeither are experienced
  Mac people.\r\n\r\nI've spent hours tech supporting them and I need to get this
  \r\nsolved so I can do my own work! : (\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\nThanks!\r\nJane"

    Illustrator or InDesign they could try putting the fonts in the \"fonts\" folder
    which is inside the applicaton folder for both apps.\r\n\r\nHow were the fonts
    installed into Font Book? Did you drag them into the user folder or did you open
    them and respond to the request to install them?"

  body: "Hi All.\r\n\r\nYes, they are being used in InDesign. I made sure they put
    the fonts into the Fonts folder in the Library for the User. I also had them do
    a search for other versions of the font and get rid of all of them except the
    one.\r\n\r\nShe's now getting fonts printing out strangely. Selecting Minion for
    example and it prints out really weird. I told her to try printing that font from
    another app first. Then also printing that same text in a new InDesign file, in
    case the current one is currupt....to at least see if it's an app problem or a
    font problem or a doc problem.\r\n\r\nI could try suggesting that they put  the
    fonts in the Apps folder. Still seems like there's something wrong. I know FontBook
    isn't that great. \r\n\r\nHas anyone heard about font issues with 10.4.7 or .8?
    A friend who upgraded to Tiger a while back did the .7 updater and had tons of
    font problems. She downgraded to .3 or something and all the font problems went
    away.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know about .8.\r\n\r\nOne last thing...is it possible
    anyone is using a printer these days that isn't postscript compatible? Seems she
    is getting errors that a font she has used isn't available when she goes to print
    OR make a pdf, even though the printer font is there in the folder, seems to be
    there in FontBook and doesn't get an error message when trying to choose the font
    in InDesign. This is nuts. I get an error message on selecting a font if the printer
    font isn't available...as it should be.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nJane"

    fonts. check your prefrences.\r\nWow what a mess...I would make sure all fonts
    are off and only load the new ones.\r\nAgain try suitcase or other font management
    software.\r\n\r\nI have not had these problems with all versions. all machines
    are unique. I would not keep upgrading and down grading.\r\n\r\ngood luck"
