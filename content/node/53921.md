    which one? Pixelfont means an outline\r\nfont that renders out as a bitmap at
    one size.\r\n\r\nBTW: http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\nThe 13 Regular
    looks a bit like Arial in some\r\nways, but in toto I hope Mana is much better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is good but not very close to the ones we are looking for.\r\n\r\nit is easy to
    get that effect in photoshop through turning off anti-aliasing... but we need
    that look in indesign or illustrator ;)"

  body: "Well, in an illustration/layout program a pixelfont will only look right
    at one size, which is not something one can ensure in such programs because of
    the ease and usefulness of zooming; in fact viewing scale is supposed to be irrelevant
    to the final look of the document. And if you output as PDF, even if you can start
    the document at 100% the user will reflexively change that. Not to mention the
    sort of scaling that a browser might do...\r\n\r\nNow, if you mean you want the
    pixel look to be obvious, all you have to do is use any pixelfont large.\r\n\r\n>
    it is easy to get that effect in photoshop through turning off anti-aliasing...
    \r\n\r\nActually for almost all fonts that ends up looking like junk.\r\nWhich
    is why people made pixelfonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
