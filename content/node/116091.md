body: "Hi everyone\r\nHaving used QuarkXPress for years, I'm still struggling when
  it comes to transfer my working habits into InDesign \u2014 you can't specify H&J
  parameters outside of a Paragraph Style Sheet, the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\"
  doesn't involve using the space key at all, etc.\r\nQuark also used to allow tweaking
  the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature which I've always found very
  handy (to adjust the space before and after the figure 1 in most classic sans serif
  typefaces like Univers or Akzidenz Grotesk, for instance). Does anybody know if
  InDesign includes a similar feature and, if so, where can it be found ?"
