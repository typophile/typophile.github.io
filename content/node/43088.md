body: "hello, \r\nafter 10.000 b.c., i wished to see a more accurate movie about the
  stone age,\r\nand ended up seeing one million years b.c. (supline: this is the way
  it was)^^\r\ni really enjoyed the movie, theres half-naked women, no dialogue at
  all,\r\nan harryhausens famous stopmotion animation.\r\n\r\ni also really liked
  the opening credits.\r\nthey used a very bold font, which i suppose is custom made,\r\nand
  also a more normal typeface, which is perhaps widely used,\r\nwell i couldn\u2019t
  identify.\r\n\r\nbut anyway i am more interested in the bold font.\r\ndoes anybody
  know anything about it, please let me know.\r\nor if you got anything else to say
  about this font and my taste,\r\nlet me know as well.\r\n\r\nps\r\n10.000 bc sucked.
  very much. but it was still fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omybc01_3751.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omybc02_4419.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omybc03_6644.jpg]"

  body: At the time these were probably still being hand-lettered so using the word
    knock-off seems a little strong.

  body: "i also think they were custom made (= hand lettered)\r\nthey are quite crude,
    notably the \"C\" feels hairy.\r\nso this could be a nice project to digitize
    those.\r\ni mean, if somebody thinks the are worth the effort.\r\n\r\n"
