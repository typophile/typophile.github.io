    <i>The Inuktitut langauge was developed in the 18th Century</i> <BR> <BR>The Inuktitut
    language&#40;s&#41; have been around a lot longer than that, while the Inuktitut
    writing system has only been around since the 19th century.'

  body: I think the fact checkers at the beeb should lose their bonus pay.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Browser
    settings on normal computers have not supported the language to date, but attavik.net
    has changed that.  <BR> <BR>Is that true for the Mac? I thought they&#39;d been
    shipping a suitable font for a while. At least that&#39;s what Ross told me when
    he sold me the font :-&#41; Maybe the BBC doesn&#39;t think of the Mac as a &#39;normal
    computer&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Si

    calling the kettle black&#34; &#40;apparently its racist!&#41;, so I&#39;ll stick
    to &#34;Fridge calling the washing machine white&#34; :P <BR> <BR>I find this
    script fascinating - it first came to my attention during our &#40;UK&#41; Queen&#39;s
    golden jubilee in 2002. Check out the STOP sign &#40;you&#39;ll need to scroll

    <BR> <BR>The font used is Ross Mills&#39; Euphemia, which we&#39;ve also licensed
    from Tiro.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si
