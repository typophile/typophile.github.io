body: "i'm working on a redesign of an alt weekly over here. our competitor uses [[http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/Amplitude|FB's
  Amplitude]] as a headline font so I'd like to stray as far away as possible from
  that. \r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm using Aaux Pro Medium for subheads, Aaux Pro Poster
  for section titles and I think I've settled on Melior for body copy, but a well
  balanced, possibly serif headline font is hard to find. A condensed option would
  be grand. Actually, my only real \"want\" is for the headline and the subhead to
  be opposite - one sans, and one serif. I'd like to achieve some balance and texture
  through those choices.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I'd greatly appreciate
  any ideas, or love/hate combinations, or general discussion.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch,
  I really enjoy reading these boards!\r\n\r\n "

  body: Pratt is gorgeous, but sadly a little dressy for us...I'm actually in LOVE
    with [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Antenna|FB's Antenna]] but at $1400 for the
    set, we can't afford it. Can anyone think of a comparable font that's significantly,
    significantly cheaper? We're just a small indie outfit, so large corporate backing
    isn't in the equation for delicious font purchases. $200, we could do. $1400?
    Not so much. Sigh!!

  body: "Yes, but do you neeeeed all 56 styles? Why not carefully select 6 styles
    of Antenna -- your choice -- for US $180?\r\n\r\nBut I'm not convinced Antenna
    is far enough away from Amplitude. What styles of Amplitude is your competition
    using -- wide or narrow, light or black?\r\n\r\nWhat would you be looking for
    in a serif headline (if Pratt is too \"dressy\")? Even bolder? Less contrast?
    More slabbish? More compact? \r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "oh but kent, don't we all NEED 56 styles of everything and always?! ha! good
    point --  but an even better point is that amplifier and antenna may not be dissimilar
    enough. the Other Guys are using what looks to be amplifier black wide. \r\n\r\nI
    still like the heaviness of a bold font with the headlines. something that's more
    slabbish, more punchy, less suit-and-tie, less conservative and more scrappy-underdog-we're
    thriving against all odds-plus-we're-cool kinda thing. What a tall order  - maybe
    it should be a sans, i can balance it out with a serif subhead (ie. Belizio or
    clarendon). \r\n\r\nOuf. How does one choose?! Where to start?!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dispatch is exactly the right idea, and I've looked at it as well, but I
    worry it's still too similar. It's like I need the exact opposite-yet-twin of
    that font (no, not Stainless, though).\r\n\r\nI'm obviously going to base body
    font off of the headline, though, so Melior's flexible.\r\n\r\nI was considering
    Gotham, but Obamarama has unfortunately made that option too cliched. And Giza's
    really fun, but I worry it's too swirly. At the moment I've got one template using
    Belizio Bold as the headline, that's not looking too bad.\r\n\r\nCan I eke one
    last final suggestion from you in the vein of the anti-Dispatch? I'd greatly appreciate
    it!"

    where to go with that. Can you say more about what would be anti-Dispatch for
    you?\r\n\r\nGotham . . . Giza . . . we're all over the map here ;-)\r\n\r\n--

  body: I'm not really sure what you after, either. Have you looked at anything from
    DSType, such as [[http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=59|Dobra]] or [[http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=55|Priva]]?
    Dobra in particular is really "cool", and it is hot off the shelf.
