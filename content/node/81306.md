  to license it for myself if it is available.\r\nAs for the font they have in their
  OneSource logo. This seems so very close to various fonts I already have but can't
  quite\r\nnail it down as it seems the O has a bit more complexity and shape to it
  over a standard circle or ellipse, the S is very open\r\nand the R is very geometric
  and wide compared to most fonts I looked that fit with the rest of the letter shapes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ONESOURCE_Reuters_combo_4168.jpg]"

  body: ' Yeah I figured there was properly a good chance a large company like Thomson
    Reuters would get something custom. As it turned out Interbrand and Eric Olson
    was a solid solution for the OneSource division. Thanks for your help identifying
    it. '

  body: "As previously noted, it is a custom typeface, however curiosity got to me.
    \r\nI shot them an email, and it turns out it One Source was actually based off
    of the font <em>Locator</em>.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator/\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
