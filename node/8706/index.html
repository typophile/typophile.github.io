		<div class="commentbody">It occurred to me that Keith asked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gill Sans - the typeface that first make me want to enquire further into typography. To be precise, the uppercase G. People say its overused. Never. Misused, perhaps. ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perpetua's proportions work so well with Gill Sans, and to my mind is a wonderful marriage. The italics are compact and beautiful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdana looks great on screen, both aliased and antialiased, and its all down to its spacing. If you must read on screen, there is no finer read than 11pt verdana on a 72dpi screen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sabon (and Sabon Next) are wonderfully legible and utterly handsome.

		<div class="commentbody">As likely the only person here who has the same birthday as Massimo, I feel entitled to say I think the whole notion of limiting oneself to five typefaces is utter nonsense. I am constantly amazed that more designers don't share my very strong feeling that the content ought to heavily influence the design. Now, it may be that Massimo simply doesn't take projects that don't scream out for one of his fraternal quintuplets, but then, that would be pretty lazy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I go through phases wherein I'm more inclined to try a particular couple of faces first (or, like playing too much with a new toy, I overuse cool new fonts I've just bought), but lordy &ndash; to restrict oneself like that just boggles my mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And finally, I will say that I appreciate John Hudson's comment about letterpress publishers. I can understand that a letterpress craftsperson could focus solely on one face, trying for all time to perfect the use of such face. Still, that is a radically different sort of design than what I and Massimo, my fellow birthday-boy, practice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, a list of top-five <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foundries<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the other hand&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dave, you nailed it on the head there, and I do share your very strong feeling that the content ought to heavily influence the design <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(cut and paste makes me type faster ;) )<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The work of David Carson amongst others made me realize that the first thing you need to do when starting a design is to analyze the cultural and other demographics of your target audience (whenever possible). The main reason why he got away with those difficult to read lay-outs is because his target audience was motivated. They didn't mind to put in the extra effort to decipher his pages because it just looked so friggin' good and they were interested in the content. I like to see that as &quot;tribal design&quot;, where a certain style with its specific codes, symbols etc. is recognized by its target audience as being &quot;authentic&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I fear this might not be entirely clear but my English is failing me here).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As how I try to imply this way of working: for example the design with 7 or 8 typefaces to a page I was talking about in the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Matchmaking&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thread was for an informative magazine aimed at parents with teenage kids, but it was implied in the brief that the magazine should be attractive and inviting to the teenagers as well so they would pick it up too. So my reader demographic was split into two definite chunks of teens and thirty-somethings. This made me approach the typography and colour scheme in a totally different way than the magazine for human resources managers that was entirely set in FF Info and FF Meta. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are the kind of challenges that make this graphic design thing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interesting. And I must say I can get sooo bored by these highbrow hotshot designers who persist in setting everything in Neue Helvetica 55 9/12. The quote I really like about Schmelvetica is &quot;When in doubt, set in Helvetica. You're never right, but at least you're never wrong.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and before y'all start yelling at me: I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> occasionally use Helvetica. All I need is a very, very good reason and a watertight rationale. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.S. Isaac I thought I noticed a hint of sarcasm in your first post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> And frankly, no, I didn't expect that funny bit about Comic Sans. LOL</div>
