body: Here is my latest brainstorm on the navigation metaphor that Reveleare has created.
  The three screens represent three hypothetical levels of the site, in the order
  they appear. <BR> <BR>The small logo on the second two levels fades-in once the
  root level is penetrated. This logo doubles as a quick navigation device and information
  bar. <BR> <BR>I like this encarnation of the MT site &#40; other versions are visible
  elsewhere on the boards &#41; because it actually integrates the logo presence with
  the form of the site. <BR> <BR>My main question to you is how well I&#39;ve succeeded
  in taking the color-coded, zooming grid navigation metaphor that Revelare has pioneered,
  and incorporated it into my own site in a unique fashion. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/23214.gif"

  body: '&#34;zooming grid navigation metaphor &#34; <BR> <BR>Is it really a metaphor?
    As far as I can tell, it is literally a zooming grid, no? <BR> <BR>I kind of said
    this last time...it&#39;s an interesting experiment in navigation, but it&#39;s
    been done before. Navigation is a rather practical element to a web site. While
    it&#39;s fun to come up with new ideas in interaction and then allow that interaction
    to really &#39;be&#39; the site, I don&#39;t think using what has already been
    done really works, since this is no longer &#39;new&#39; and therefore the &#39;hey,
    cool, check this out!&#39; factor is no longer there and you&#39;re just left
    with a rather unfamiliar navigation system. <BR> <BR>In otherwords, I&#39;d suggest
    coming up with something new as in completely different, or stick with some good
    tried-and-true navigation systems.  <BR> <BR>As for comments on what I see now,
    my only concern would be that the type is incredibly small. I can&#39;t imagine
    too many people would find it that readable on a high resolution monitor &#40;unless
    you are planning on making this a resizable flash piece, which may resolve some
    of the readability issues&#41;.'

  body: some good points, darrel <BR> <BR>additionally ... if i created a logo for
    myself that looked exactly like the coca-cola logo, except that i rotated it 45
    degrees .. i&#39;m still ripping off the coca-cola logo. <BR> <BR>the diamond
    shapes destroy the &#39;pixel metaphor&#39; that you mentioned in an earlier post,
    no?

  body: 'Darrel, yes, it literally is a zooming grid. Your points are well-made in
    regards the tried and true nav systems. However, I disagree with you on a few
    points. Everyone I have tested the site with has one reaction: the site is new,
    cool, and intuitive. They actually get excited as they discover how the site works
    by their own experimentation as the fun factor sinks in, they begin to focus on
    my products, and in that brief time of newfound fun, my products become real to
    them, and they like them. <BR> <BR>Not a bad way to present my products for sale,
    eh? As for those who have seen and used the zooming grid before, well, they already
    know how to use it. <BR> <BR>As for trying to be the world&#39;s most original
    designer. I&#39;ve said many times on these boards that this is not one of my
    goals with the site design. I just want a site that is going to reinforce my products
    as organically as possible. This zooming &#34;pixel&#34; navigation system does
    just that. Little pixels that grow large and relveal content over and over has
    the effect of transporting you into the world of the small, where pixel fonts
    traditionally reside. <BR> <BR>As for the font being small: these are pixel fonts
    after all. Many MT fonts are much larger than the one used in the diamond titling.
    However, upon closer examination of the design, each square is on a 4x zoom factor.
    That means that the small titles that represent the next &#34;tier&#34; of options
    are set at 8pt. The title of the section you&#39;re residing in is set at 32pt.
    To go from 8 to 16 at the bottom would mean 64pt up top. <BR> <BR>JH, it seems
    to me now that your intentions when replying to my posts are less motivated by
    a desire to contribute to the process of creation than a desire to tear down whatever
    enthusiasm/credibility I may have. <BR> <BR>I could be misenterpreting your latest
    reply, of course, but consder this: your whole argument on the original post centered
    around the fact that my previous MT design was the exact design of Revelare&#39;s
    because I used the same grid system they used. The graphics of the two sites were
    too similar, and that destroyed any argument I might have about a zooming grid
    not being a proprietary design. <BR> <BR>So now that I&#39;ve taken that GRAPHIC
    DESIGN and completely reinvented it, so that the site, its products and the zooming
    itself actually takes on the shape and body of the logo presence itself &#40;
    something that the logo design had to allow for, doubling the DESIGN requirements
    to pull such a thing off &#41;, you say I&#39;m still ripping off'

    and intuitive, but that credit should be given to the people who designed it.
    <BR> <BR>Your enthusiasm is the one thing about you that I do respect. What I
    desire is for you to just admit that you stole the relevare site, and stop pretending
    that you &#39;completely reinvented&#39; it. <BR> <BR>as far as the coca-cola
    logo example goes .. you completely misunderstood. The point I was making is that
    if you take someone else&#39;s design, and rotate it 45 degrees, it doesn&#39;t
    make it a new design. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve done with the Relevare site in
    this &#39;new&#39; version of your site. Apparently my illustration was unclear.
    I was not saying anything about your logo, which I have no problems with. <BR>
    <BR>I have realized that nothing i say will make you realize the offense you are
    committing by launching this site. So go for it. I simply hope that you give credit
    where credit is due, and provide a link to relevare, the designers of your site.

  body: '&#34;has one reaction: the site is new, cool, and intuitive&#34; <BR> <BR>Well,
    then I&#39;d say go for it.  <BR> <BR>Personally, I find whiz-bang navigation
    not to my liking, and tend to avoid sites that use it...especially sites trying
    to sell me something, but, like I said, that&#39;s just my own opinion.  <BR>
    <BR>As for JH&#39;s comments, he has a very valid point. You don&#39;t have to
    agree with it, but realize that a percentage of your target audience may agree
    with it. It&#39;s up to you to decide how big of an issue that is for you. A lot
    of people will say that your site is a clear knock-off, even though is may visually
    look a bit different...it&#39;s the actual site navigation that makes the site
    design. The visual look is secondary. I can&#39;t say how many people will make
    that connection, of course. '

  body: 'jh, <BR> <BR>First of all, let me say your work is very well done. I really
    like the quality and quantity of work. The client list on bigspaceship is very
    impressive as well. <BR> <BR>Now, I just want to clear a few things up. Apparently,
    you have in turn not understood my words. If you visit tyleryoungcreative and
    navigate to the section entitled mean tangerine, and read the text description
    of the screen shot there, you will see that I have never claimed to invent the
    Revelare zoom system. TYC is now one year old. My posts here are on average six
    months old. Not sure about that, but ballpark. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll say it again.
    I&#39;m not concerned with being the first one to invent the zooming grid. I never
    said I was its pioneer. I never will. <BR> <BR>In your peepshow piece, you use
    a mouse-sensitive mask with scrolling content behind it. Were you the first to
    invent that? I doubt it, as cool as it looks. Did you commit an offence by launching
    that site? I don&#39;t think you did. <BR> <BR>You are obviously an accomplished
    designer with many professional clients. At the very least, you are one member
    of a team of such designers. Don&#39;t you recognize what graphic design is? <BR>
    <BR>The latest generation of MT takes the zooming grid idea that Revelare has
    pioneered, true. It&#39;s graphic design, that is, the layout of content, its
    position and coloration is completely unique. <BR> <BR>The zooming squares are
    zooming squares. However, the beauty of zooming squares holding content for review
    is downright brilliant, just as a mouse and an iconic interface was in the past.
    I contend that a zooming grid of squares does not by itself constitute site design.
    Site design involves so much more! I suppose no one should ever use this elegant,
    intuitive system of organizing and presenting material for fear of not being the
    first one to build it? <BR> <BR>As for Revelare designing my site: I couldn&#39;t
    even get them to reply to my emails. <BR> <BR>As for me taking credit for the
    site being new, cool, and intuitive. Here again, you misinterpret my words. That
    is the audience&#39;s reaction. Not my assertion. Revisit every one of my long-winded
    replies and you will see that I freely give credit where credit is due. <BR> <BR>Darrel,
    thanks for your reply. I hear everything you say. Now, I disgree with you on some
    points, but that is not to say that your counterpoint is not valid. <BR> <BR>I
    do not think that the navigation system is the site design itself. Site design
    is a marriage of raw concept, product enhancement and image control. It is graphic
    design, content placement and description, typography, and other nuances that
    are much harder to define. As for the visual look being secondary, what about
    90% of all websites that use the same nav button down the left and html content
    in a grid down the middle with ads across the top and down the right? <BR> <BR>Graphical
    design is integral to the identity of a site. So that&#39;s my opinion, as briefly
    described as it is. <BR> <BR>Many, many arthouses, even the big-name ones, feed
    off of one another&#39;s designs, including navigation systems. To deny this seems
    to me a silly thing to do. <BR> <BR>Ideas build upon one another, no?'

  body: 'If I may just pipe in here: Zooming User Interfaces are not new, nor is Relevare
    the first to implement such a concept. They seem to have been first to implement
    it well in Flash with beautiful style and with excellent production value. <BR>
    <BR>There are more examples on the web just Google for Zooming User Interface.
    <BR> <BR>I have never seen an installation of Relevare&#39;s Web Index system.
    From the stale date of the press releases cited on the site I think that these
    guys are out of business. <a href="http://www.flashguru.co.uk/archives.php?page=15">Here&#39;s</a>
    kind of a confirmation of what I suspected. <BR> <BR>I think that the ZUI is an
    excellent match for MT&#39;s product. Too close to the original? Hmmm, I don&#39;t
    know. In the rest of computing a window and a menu bar and a scroll button look
    pretty similar from OS to OS, sometimes the colors are different, sometimes one
    looks 3D and one doesn&#39;t but it&#39;s still a button that does button things.
    A zoom box will pretty much look like I zoom box I suspect. A different colour,
    outline, label whatever but it will still do zoom box things. <BR> <BR>I am not
    a lawyer but if I was you Tyler, I think that you should be concerned if you borrowed
    code. Even if these guys are bankrupt the code is probably still owned or under
    copyright by somebody. Keep records of all your attempted contacts. <BR> <BR>I
    think that ZUIs have a far greater role to play in computing, wheter implemented
    in a grid system like this or in an infinitie space system like <a href="http://humane.sourceforge.net/the/zoom.html">this</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Tyler, as I have said before, I think a zooming grid and a pixel font
    house are a natural match. And if your presentation is separated from your content,
    you can always modify things and tweak things later. <BR> <BR>Good luck'
