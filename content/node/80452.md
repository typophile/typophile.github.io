body: I'm researching these for a class, and it's incredibly difficult to find books
  on the history of Cyrillic letterforms after the origins of the thing way back in
  the IX century. I'm specifically interested in Peter the Great's reforms, the 1917
  reforms, and anything on Ivan Fyodorov. Most of the things I have found so far are
  not in my university's library or don't help very much. One good article by Zhukov
  I've seen referenced is in Typographic Papers 1, but the library only has 2-7...
  It seems like the actual letterforms get ignored in favour of pretty much everything
  else. Does anyone know of some good resources on this topic?

  body: "The essay \u201CCivil Type\u201D by Vladimir Yefimov, published in the book
    <em>Language Culture Type</em> discusses the Petrine reforms and how the original
    Civil Type was produced. There\u2019s also some commentary about a contemporary
    Cyrillic by Yefimov.\r\n\r\nThe Zhukov article is a splash of historical information,
    some images highlighting common aspects of the typographic forms, and tables examining
    shape relationships across the Cyrillic, Green, and Latin alphabets. The last
    item is something that one can figure out by looking at a good multi-script font.
    There are two copies of the Zhukov article at libraries in New York, one at the
    public library and one at Columbia University\u2019s Butler library. Both are
    unfortunately in appointment-only rare books collections. The public library makes
    rare book access a huge PITA and won't let researchers make copies. Unless you\u2019re
    having a really hard time wrapping your head around Latin/Greek/Cyrillic type
    design it\u2019s probably not worth the effort it takes to access a copy."

  body: "<em>Language Culture Type</em> is only worth buying if you have a strong
    interest in the subject matter or find a cheap copy. Only about half the essays
    are especially good. Half the book is type specimens from the year 2000, a great
    deal of which are novelty fonts that time forgot (although there is a nice specimen
    of H&FJ\u2019s Retina, which isn\u2019t so easy to get in print). At $25 it\u2019s
    not a bad deal, at $50+ it\u2019s overpriced."

  body: "The 1918 spelling reform of the Soviet Government, however, could be deemed
    as much a typographical reform as the 1708 one by Peter the Great, because <em>both</em>
    of them removed several letters from the alphabet. Peter the Great went from the
    Old Slavonic alphabet to the Russian alphabet of 36 letters - and, in 1918, the
    Russian alphabet was deprived of \u0406, \u0462, \u0472 and \u0474."
