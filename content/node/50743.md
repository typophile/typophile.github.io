  from photoshop cs3 as tif, the main problem is the colour shift. I have designed
  a flyer using the pantone process uncoated swatches under cmyk mode, proofed colours
  selected and 8 bit mode. My colour settings in photoshop were set to 'monitor colour',
  so my working spaces was set to Monitor RGB - sRGB IEC61966-2.1 and cmyk was set
  to U,S, Web Coated (SWOB)v2. My problem is when I export as a TIF with the default
  export settings checked, I opened up the exported TIFF and the colour shift changed
  so much. The exported TIF didn't really look like what I was seeing in photoshop
  even though everything was colour proofed, etc in photoshop. On the other hand,
  if I check the box in the ''save as'' window under the colour setting there is an
  option when I can add a ICC Profile. It reads U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2, If I tick
  this box and then export, everything is looking fine in the exported file.\r\n\r\nThe
  reason why I have posted this is because I want to know if now what I see is what
  I can expect to see when my design is printed?? Also, can someone recommend the
  most accurate colour working spaces to work with? I am now using Abode RGB 1998
  and Uncoated FOGRA29 for cmyk and everything also seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\nHope
  you can shed a little light on this.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\ndahl\r\n"

    issues at play, but proofing CMYK on screen is really difficult (since your screen
    is displaying colors in RGB). To be able to get close, you need to calibrate your
    monitor, and you should also check with your printer to see what color profiles
    they use. I don't think the pantone swatches in any software are super accurate
    when compared to the paper swatch books, so you're going to be best off trying
    to calibrate your printer, and then printing stuff out.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll
    ask this before someone else does (and this doesn't really relate to your problem).
    Why are you designing a flyer in photoshop? Aside from the fact that photoshop
    really isn't the easiest environment to do something like that, you are not going
    to get clean text doing that."

  body: "If you are working for print, you should probably include an ICC profile
    anyway. So tick that box the next time if that increases your color accuracy.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I have my RGB set to Adobe RGB (1998) and my CMYK to Euroscale Coated V2. It is
    not a fool proof method, but as long as I keep it consistent (i.e. have <em>all</em>
    software set to the same profiles, as well as my monitor itself), the results
    are quite acceptable and predictable. \r\nBut it is important to keep all software
    on the same settings, so Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator, but also Acrobat
    Reader/Pro or anything else you might be using.\r\n\r\nAs to what you can expect
    to see when it gets to print, that depends completely on your printer. Most (professional)
    printers work with a color calibrated environment. If you want to know what the
    results will be, you will need to calibrate your monitor to their profiles and
    also use their ICC's when working. You will need to have a perfectly color calibrated
    workflow, which is quite if not very difficult. So since you will work with something
    like Adobe RGB and whatever CMYK profile is default in your region of the planet,
    there will always be a slight difference between what you see at your end and
    the printed result.\r\n\r\nAlso, you cannot accurately proof CMYK on screen, although
    a major color shift does indicate that something isn't right. The best way to
    judge the colors, without going down the calibrated workflow road, is to order
    a color proof from your printers, see what happens, and change things if it isn't
    to your liking."

    the designer to approve a proof from the printer.\r\nThen, when the job is run,
    the designer should do a press check to make sure that the finished product looks
    as good as, or better, than the proof.\r\nWhen you're looking at a press proof,
    don't make a snap decision.\r\nTake it away into a (relatively) quiet corner and

  body: ">so my working spaces was set to Monitor RGB\r\n\r\nProblem. Never set your
    working space to Monitor RGB. Adobe RGB is a usually pretty good choice, a larger
    gamut than sRGB and not as wide as ProPhoto. Your monitor profile is strictly
    for your video card.\r\n\r\nTheir advice to not add profiles is ludicrous. In
    color management a profile needs to be embedded for a good conversion to take
    place. The profile conversion needs to know what profile it's coming from in order
    to work correctly.\r\n\r\nNothing makes me madder than an image without an embedded
    profile. If that happens I first assign a profile based on what looks best and
    then convert to whatever is appropriate for the job.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nAll

    - I do now use adobe 1998 RGB because this is pretty much the standard. Yup, if
    you ask them they will say the same thing. Apparently their printers don't use
    ICC profiles either. I totally agree with what you are saying:-) So, is it ok
    to assign any profile to a document regardless of the use of your design? I pretty
    much liked the Japan newspaper profile, but wasn't sure if it would be ok to use."

    Don't use a profile different then the intended device you want your artwork shown

    use the Japanese newspaper profile! \r\n\r\nFinally, as for your printer who's
    telling you to not even bother with color profiles and won't give you a proof,
    I'd really consider using another printer. "

  body: ">> <em>I pretty much liked the Japan newspaper profile, but wasn\u2019t sure
    if it would be ok to use</em>\r\n\r\nYou should always use the default profile
    for your <em>region</em> if no profile is specified. Especially for color. Color
    profiles are generally made with sunlight intensity and color temperature on your
    area of the planet in mind. Lighting conditions in different places on the planet
    have a different effect on how printed colors look.\r\n\r\nI don't know the specifics,
    but <em>for example</em>: in Japan more yellow might be present in the light than
    in the UK. Or whatever color. So that will affect how colors look. That's one
    of the reasons why different areas have different ICC profiles; they take those
    differences into account.\r\n\r\nAlso, you should pretty much always ask for a
    proof, before the actual printing run is started. Most good printers either have
    a proofing press, or even just a good inkjet printer calibrated to mimic their
    actual production presses, on which they can make reasonably cheap color proofs.
    \r\nI cannot count how many times I had to change something to my designs when
    studying a color proof. If your printer doesn't use a color calibrated working
    environment, or can't make proofs... I would look for a different printer. :)"
