body: "This is a fairly popular slab serif.  The sample has been outlined, and only
  half of the letters filled.  Not looking for that exact treatment, but just what
  the base font may be.  Note the double serif at the top of the A, the downward curve
  of the crossbar on the A, the extreme and tilted serifs on the E, and the fairly
  high position on the middle arm of the E.   Thanks all!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text2_5560.png]"
