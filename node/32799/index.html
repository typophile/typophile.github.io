  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Good evening, all.

I'm a design student, about a year away from finishing my BFA in Graphic Design. As a graduation gift from my parents, i'm getting an all expenses paid trip to Europe. I'm looking for opinions on where exactly I should go. Preferably somewhere with good design to study and interesting sights to see. (A good nightlife wouldn't hurt, either). I was leaning toward Berlin, but I wanted to broaden my options by polling some of you who live in or have visited Europe before. 

To recap, my "checklist" of a good candidate:
1) Active, on-display design culture
2) Interesting sights
3) Good places to catch some live music
4) Just good to visit in general


Suggestions? :)

Thank you!
Eric</div>

I haven't been to Berlin before, but that's one place I'd love to go to someday. Amsterdam has some nice things too. I have to admit I wasn't a type fanatic before going to Europe in 1999, and I hadn't even taken a graphic design course yet, but I know if I went back now I'd just eat up all the design.

Maybe the best advice about (continental) Europe is that it's so small, you're always near something interesting. 

If you end up anywhere near Belgium (say, France, Germany, Netherlands) I strongly suggest a trip to Antwerp to see the <a href="http://museum.antwerpen.be/plantin_Moretus/index_eng.html">Plantin Moretus-Museum</a>. 

In fact, if you're under 25 and you own an international student card, many train trips will cost you half the regular rate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So many choices!

The Eurail Student Pass looks really cool. Also, I've never even been on a train before! 

A question:

We're (My girlfriend and I) looking very seriously at Berlin and surrounding areas.  (However, this is definitely subject to change, as I find all European places intensely interesting) How much German should I know while in the Berlin area? I want to make myself understood, but I also don't want to be so basic that I'm talking like a German caveman. 

<em>Zurich and Antwerp</em> are two other places we're interested in...The printing museum in Antwerp looks VERY interesting (for me, at least).  Is it feasible to stay in Berlin and visit these other cities?

<em>I've got 2 weeks, and I want to see a lot, but also be relatively low key as far as amount of time traveling.</em> 

Thank you all so much,

		<div class="commentbody">I speak German fluently, albeit with a horrendous Baltimore accent. However, one can get by as a tourist quite well in Germany with just English. In my experience, this has been a little more difficult in Italy and France. Here in Germany, though, many will immediately switch to English when they begin to hear me talk, which is not necessary, although I always appreciate that they are trying to be helpful.

If you stay in Berlin and want to go to Antwerp and Zurich, it would be best to take the train to one of them, and then stay in that city for a night or two (or longer!) and then return to Berlin. Zurich must be 8 hours away from Berlin, even via fast train. Maybe Antwerp can be reached in four? But don't forget Dessau and Weimar. These are easy day trips from Berlin.</div>

if you only have two weeks though, i'd hardly do more than 2 cities. for me 4 days is the smallest amount of time possible to get to know a city (a tiny little bit), and esp. with you having never been to europe, maybe one or two cities really would be the best.

in zurich you should easily be able to get by with english only, just the other day i helped two indonesian girls to find their way around the city. we're nice people ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My vote would go for Holland, as I'm also very impressed by the overal amount and quality of design in everything. There's also interesting modern architecture to see if you dig around. It's nice to rent a bike and drive around.. remember to visit other places than Amsterdam too.

For a two week trip it's worthwile to visit East Berlin, there's certainly a lot going on currently. 

EDIT: Just wanted to add as a human, not as a designer, that I'll rather travel around Eastern Europe, and not only because it's cheaper and the food is better. It's hard to explain, but I feel like the places are more alive. You also get along with a very slow english and making signs. Maybe a train trip like Prague-Krakow-Budapest-Kroatia? I've never been to Kroatia, but I think maybe this summer..</div>
