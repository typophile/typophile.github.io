<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Lately I've been pairing Eureka with Monotype Grotesque. In theory the pairing doesn't work–they're not remotely close historically, the x-heights differ obviously, and Eureka has a slight stress whereas MT Grot has none. But for some reason they just seem to work together, and nobody seems to mind. I realize that this is partly due to my only using it in situations where the typefaces are not use where they'll line up and the differences are noticeable, but there's more to it than that.
Is this just one of those odd exceptions to pairing conventions? Or is it common to come up with such couples that contrast well as long as they're not up against each other?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd love to hear thoughts on this. I did an untutored pairing of <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-lt/>Univers LT</a> and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/minion/>Minion Pro</a>, without realizing there were guidelines to pairing. So, although it's too late to change anything with that client, I can't wait to hear the insights brought on this subject.</div>

<div class=commentbody>jpad, i like making pairs with a strong contrast. i'd love to use fleischmann together with AG for example, or avant garde with bembo (altough i really cant imagine the latter looking good).
if the pairing makes sense for the design, i think "conventions" are unimportant. the eye decides whats right and whats wrong.
i mean i had to use imago with minion once in my internship, and it was boring. nothing happened on the pages, it was dead. they fit together pretty well of course, but i thought it looked boring. very boring.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The confirms what I usually say in response to requests for a good pair for ________. My answer is usually: "almost anything -- like any typeface choice, make your decision based on the subject matter and your audience."</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's not all that different from matching food and wine: there are basic rules (whites with fish, seafood, chicken, and pork: reds with beef and game), but the essence of good cuisine is knowing when to break those rules. ;-)
(This from the woman who serves good rosés with everything from salmon to pork....)</div>
