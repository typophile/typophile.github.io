  body: 'Too bad we can&#39;t have MM Leporello ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Overall, I like it,
    especially the lc g.  <BR> <BR>The entry stroke on lc b and lc thorn isn&#39;t
    working for me, although I like it on the lc i. Perhaps it&#39;s because I then
    expect it elsewhere, like on lc h, l, k, etc. Also, the counter in uc Thorn looks
    a bit small to me, especially next to the lc version. '

  body: Interesting stuff. <BR>There are some strong stylistic &#39;contradictions&#39;
    in this &#39;face &#40;see, for example, h versus n&#41;. I wonder what&#39;s
    the rationale behind such design conflicts. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad
    thing, per se, I just think that the contradictions are too strong/ evident here.
    The letters need a little more formal coherence, IMHO.

    treatments of individual letters, and still have the whole harmonize and balance.
    I think a PDF with text would help to see how well it harmonizes or fails to and
    contradicts itself. The few words you posted promise a nice harmony and balance.
    If it does harmonize it would be valuable, as you would have achieved a greater
    differentiation of letters, and possibily easier readability, than is usual in
    a sans. '

  body: OK, the PDF works now. <BR> <BR>Not surprisingly, this is a face that cannot
    be evaluated in the normal fashion - otherwise one would blindly conclude &#34;it&#39;s
    ugly&#34; and leave it at that. The relevance of such a design is tied to the
    existence of the &#34;dark half&#34; of reading, the half where a reader doesn&#39;t
    notice the details of the font, but is affected by it nonetheless. <BR> <BR>Evaluating
    such a font requires a very strong understanding of readability, and the deeper
    mechanisms of reading, for example to what extent familiarity matters, and what
    details readers notice. I don&#39;t know anybody who can do this. But I can try
    to share some of my own hazy insight. <BR> <BR>- I think the &#34;a&#34; needs
    its lower-right spur. <BR>- And the &#34;g&#34; needs its ear. <BR>- The &#34;k&#34;
    needs staggered arms, maybe one of them bowed. <BR>- The &#34;v&#34;/&#34;w&#34;/&#34;y&#34;
    are too static as a group. <BR>- I&#39;d make the &#34;J&#34; descending. <BR>-
    The &#34;@&#34; is too chirographic. <BR>- I&#39;d flatten the UC acutes/graves.
    <BR>- The BP is off. <BR>- That &#34;L&#34; in the Pilcrow is bril! <BR>- I don&#39;t
    think the Differential should lean. <BR>- The Florin should lean though. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, looking at the vertical proportions and color, it looks like a face that
    would work best at larger text sizes, like around 12 point. But for that the spacing
    is slightly loose. <BR> <BR>Whatever you do though, don&#39;t expect virtually
    anybody to understand what this is about - the Modernist age is not good at tolerating
    such extrapolation - it&#39;s just something you&#39;ll have to believe in, and
    apply in the best way you can. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; If that were not so,
    what would we strive for? <BR> <BR>I feel the same way. But some people like to
    celebrate more than strive. I guess they have more fun though. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    some of the letterform structures you used <BR>&#62; in your GIF look very Middle

    do this? And also the a seems too wide to me. The flag at the top of the b sticks

    good improvements.  <BR> <BR>Now I see your idea of great variation in the letters
    in your &#39;cloaked&#39; version. It think it is too much.  <BR> <BR>There is
    a balance between repetition and variation in any pattern to make it work aesthetically.
    I have heard, I forget where, that in music it is about 50-50. If the melody doesn&#39;t
    have some kind of repetition it doesn&#39;t come together as a melody, but just
    is a series of notes. Thus you have the typical establishment of the theme in
    four bars, the next four bars with variation of the theme, the third four a different
    variation, and return to the theme.  <BR> <BR>In other words with too much variation
    a melody just doesn&#39;t come together as a &#39;gestalt&#39; that the mind can
    wrap itself around. On the other hand, if there is too much repetition it becomes
    boring and annoying, like the infernal &#39;Doublemint&#39; jingle. <BR> <BR>I
    think that this kind of patterning principle also holds for readability. And I
    think you have gone too far in the variety direction. But if you figure a way
    to pull back - there are a lot of ways to do it because you have so much variation
    - you could end up with something that is balanced and innovative.  <BR> <BR>By
    the way, the narrowed top of the g works now for me, where it didn&#39;t before.

  body: 'I&#39;m just working on my first typeface, so be forewarned you are not getting
    the voice of experience here. <BR> <BR>The thing I like most about this now are
    your serifs at the top of the ascenders.  <BR> <BR>My suspicion is that if the
    n, h, and o were slightly narrower it would make for a better rhythm in the text.
    <BR> <BR>I wonder whether it would be better with the l with the serif on the
    ascender. The bl combination is a little jarring in the text. Having the d with
    no serif is more &#39;natural&#39; looking as the serif on the d in a serif face
    is sometimes different than all the other ascenders.  <BR> <BR>The bottom serif
    on the l - should the terminal be more similar to the ascender serifs?  <BR> <BR>The
    i serif. I think this needs to relate more to the ascender serif also - maybe
    just being shorter would work. Now, with the serif bending down, it think it should
    overshoot like the o; it looks short now. Also you could consider putting a stem
    on the r. As the Underware fellows explain <a href="http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&amp;id2=&amp;id3=&amp;id4=&amp;id5=&amp;idpic=17#pictloader"
    target="_blank">here</a> the r usually has more of a notch than the m,n. And that
    helps keep the rn from looking like an m. If you are going to have as serif on
    the i you might consider doing something on the j and r also. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    know what can work here, but I do think that the serifs on the ascenders are a
    success, and working the face to make it harmonize and work best with these is
    the way to go.   '

  body: 'Chris, you&#39;re not speaking to yourself - on my end I was saving the best
    for last. <BR> <BR>Few people can appreciate what you&#39;re doing - it&#39;s
    way out there - it requires a dedication to the dark depths of reading - something
    very rarely promoted. <BR> <BR>Know that most type designers who see this will
    think it&#39;s garbage &#40;and most of them won&#39;t have the balls to tell
    you&#41;. Some people will think it&#39;s &#34;cute&#34;. My advice is this: filter
    feedback based on context: learn to ignore certain specific kinds of advice from
    people who might be great conventional font designers but have no real idea of
    the dark currents sweeping to and fro in the recesses of the human brain. Or:
    Don&#39;t ask a poodle trainer to handle an anaconda. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    a good time to back up. <BR> <BR>What I think you should go for &#40;and you might
    already be doing this&#41; is a font that creates a texture &#40;at reading point
    sizes&#41; the layman won&#39;t reject, but diverge the forms as much as possible
    nonetheless. I think you&#39;re actually being slightly conservative! But it will
    make for a great test case. You will have to publish a booklet &#40;not related
    to typography&#41; that uses it, and ask laymen &#40;NOT other designers&#41;
    what they think - and ask them in the most indirect -even devious- ways - to see
    what&#39;s really going on. <BR> <BR>Some specifics: <BR>-Why are the caps and
    numerals so conventional? <BR>-I&#39;d make the eye of the &#34;e&#34; smaller.
    <BR>-I&#39;d make the &#34;s&#34; narrower and the &#34;y&#34; wider. <BR>-I think
    your accents are generally smallish. <BR>-Try making the blank space a hair bigger.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; There is a balance between repetition and <BR>&#62;
    variation in any pattern to make it work <BR>&#62; aesthetically. <BR> <BR>But
    there&#39;s a critical difference here between display and text, between deliberative
    and immersive reading. The threshold of harmony/discord depends on how deep into
    the subconscious you&#39;re aiming. <BR> <BR>What is seen as discord by our finicky
    -and subjective- conscious aesthetic appreciation is used by the subconscious
    to read more efficiently. <BR> <BR>&#62; the infernal &#39;Doublemint&#39; jingle.
    <BR> <BR>Tellingly in fact, a study has shown the more obnoxious a jingle the
    more memorable it is! What we think we like isn&#39;t necessarily what we really
    like. <BR> <BR>&#62; I never liked the stepped &#34;k&#34; <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s

    and away from dogma :-&#41;   <BR>I was never one who liked to adhere to fixed
    absolutes.   <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;-Why are the caps and numerals so conventional?  <BR>
    <BR>Because I figured caps rarely appear in text and didn&#39;t seem to be an
    issue--However, I have some ideas for the caps too and will try them out. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;-I&#39;d make the eye of the &#34;e&#34; smaller.  <BR> <BR>I just did,
    it is better now. You will see when I post the next PDF. <BR> <BR>&#62;-I&#39;d

    point with the &#34;s&#34; but I will have to be careful not to make it too dark;
    tinkering is 90% of this work.  <BR>The &#34;y&#34; has always bothered me, maybe
    it is something as simple as the width.  I kept thinking I needed to curve the
    right fork back. <BR> <BR>&#62;-I think your accents are generally smallish.  <BR>
    <BR>I just enlarged them. &#40;god, I sound like those awful SPAM emails&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62;-Try making the blank space a hair bigger. . . . <BR> <BR>I have
    this dilemma with the word space.  It seems to need more, as you say, at text
    sizes but a bit less when used larger.  I guess I should trust the user to track
    the larger sizes tighter. <BR> <BR>&#62;But it&#39;s less of an &#34;x&#34;. &#60;&#60;
    <BR> <BR>Yes it is but I am working on a somewhat different solution involving
    curves but not stepped.  I will post it when it is more resolved. <BR> <BR>I have
    been trying to push a solution &#40;probably too quickly&#41; just to have something
    for TypeGallery so I went conservative.  After I step back for a couple of weeks,
    I will have a more distant vision and be able &#34;see&#34; better.  Right now
    I am too close to the forest.  All of my less-than-typical attempts at this point
    look completely normal to me.  I don&#39;t see anything at all radical in what
    I have done.  Perhaps it comes of being too immersed. <BR> <BR>I hope you will
    review my next PDF as well, I need someone to keep me off the straight and narrow

    the o helped a lot. I don&#39;t quite know how to react to the typeface as it
    stands. It has polish, and a much more lively texture than most san serifs, which
    is all to the good. But to me it also looks excentric to a point that is a bit
    distracting.  <BR> <BR>It may be that Hrants view is right that the way to go
    is just all the way with the concept, and just make it as good looking as possible
    with its varied shape, or maybe even more varied shapes.  <BR> <BR>Emigre has
    done a lot of to me excentric stuff that has found a place in the type world,

    Of course, I think it too would benefit from a slight slant. The only characters
    that didn&#39;t quite look right are the &#40;double&#41; quotation marks. However,
    I&#39;m at a loss to describe what I would do differently, or even what exactly

  body: Chris, as I said early in the thread, I found this alphabet as having too
    much variation in it. Your black version has changed the bent stems effectively
    into serifs, which for me work much more harmoniously. My guess would be that
    if you worked backwards and did the lighter weights with a similar treatment,
    you would have a result that would be more harmonious, and have more use. Two
    things still stick out to me as awkward. The &#39;k&#39; having the serif go the
    opposite way from the b and h I don&#39;t see the visual logic in. Also the arm
    on the r seems too heavy or droopy or something.  <BR> <BR>A lot of successful
    faces, I have read, have started out very &#39;far out&#39;, and then the designers
    have pulled back into a more conventional direction, until they had a more conventional
    alphabet, but with a distinctive flavor.  <BR> <BR>Because type design is in my
    view by nature a very conservative field &#40;unlike science&#41;, I think this
    is the wiser way to go. But of course I am just one pair of eyes, and not professional
    ones at that.

    may take some getting used to for many type-savvy people.  I have gotten so used

  body: 'Chris,  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking at your Cyrillic. Well, it&#39;s a beginning,
    but you have to do a &#42;lot&#42; of work on it. I recommend that you take a
    look at ParaType&#39;s typefaces. Since your font is black, I&#39;d recommend
    taking a look at:  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8"

    <BR> <BR>The FreeSet shows you what you can do in a Cyrillic be to compensate
    the overly blackness &#40;reduce the bowl&#41;. Currently, your be looks rather
    weak. Your Cyrillic i is far too deeply cut-in, looks as if it will fall apart.
    Connect the slanted element more firmly with the stems. Remember that a Cyrillic
    I is nothing like a reversed Latin N. Compare:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28"

    <BR> <BR>Your Cyrillic ka and zhe are nice, although, since your typeface includes
    these strange curves like on the top of the Latin k, you might try to make the
    Cyrillic ka and zhe more curvy, as in the Black Grotesk or Bell Gothic examples:  <BR>
    <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7</a>

    <BR> <BR>Fine-tune your Cyrillic el and de -- the left stem of the de should really
    be slightly slanted. Your lowercase Cyrillic ef is too light, and you&#39;re not
    showing your uppercase ef, so it&#39;s hard do say. But you definitely should
    do some work on that.  <BR> <BR>The curvy teeth on ce and shcha work well, but
    they look awfully in the de -- you need to think of something better there. Remember
    that the teeth in de should &#42;never&#42; point outwards, this makes the letter
    look like an unskilled skater. The teeth should be either parallel, or they may
    point inwards -- you sure need some more solid work, and ideally an expert&#39;s
    advice on that.  <BR> <BR>For a start, your Cyrillic is adequate though. You managed
    to avoid the most horrific atrocities often found in first-timers&#39; Cyrillics.  <BR>
    <BR>You may want to simplify the dcaron, tcaron, lcaron -- refer to the diacritics

    is good but the Lslash is not. The slanted element in Lslash should be flatter
    &#40;i.e. slightly more towards horizontal&#41; and the right arm should be a
    bit longer. But principally, the Black is very handsome.  <BR> <BR>The junction
    of ogonek with the basic letter in the Bold cut is too thin, but in the Black,
    it&#39;s very good. In other words, in the Bold, it looks as if the ogonek is
    disconnected from the letter in a uglyish way.  <BR> <BR>As Robert already pointed
    out, the slanted element in the Light cut as shown in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf"
    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf</a>
    is just too thin. Also, it lslash, the slanted element is too wide, especially
    to the left. On the other hand, in Lslash, the slanted element is too short to
    the right, and too much pointing upwards &#40;should be flatter&#41;. Also, in
    the Light, it really looks as if the ogonek were not connected to the letter,
    which gives a strange effect. Rotate your &#34;p&#34; by 90 degree to the right
    and look at the connection between the bowl and the stem: it&#39;s much &#34;stronger&#34;
    than your connection between ogonek and &#34;a&#34;. I do appreciate your attempt
    to make a sort of an ink trap there, but it&#39;s just too much of an in-cut.  <BR>
    <BR>Finally, the figures: somehow they look like a plain rip off from Akzidenz
    Grotesk. They don&#39;t seem to follow the style of the letters. They&#39;re just
    too plain and too round <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    myself would offer this important alert: <BR>When a font is structurally &#34;pushy&#34;
    &#40;not mainstream&#41; like your Latin most certainly is, you have to be very
    careful about how you <i>cast</i> non-Latin extensions. Since a font is something
    useful and -hopefully- not just a formal exercise, the various script components
    of the family have to be useful <i>in the same way</i> for a user to be able to
    combine the components with a controllable effect. The non-Latin instances of
    Leporello should be equally pushy, and in the context of users of each script.
    This is very hard to do for a non-native... <BR> <BR>So for example when Adam
    writes &#34;since your typeface includes these strange curves like on the top

    more to the left &#40;some 7-10% of the glyph&#39;s width&#41;, now its placement
    is somewhat not harmonous with the other &#42;ogonek glyphs. Good work on the
    tcaron/dcaron/lcaron. I think your macrons are too weak and a bit too narrow.
    The slanted element in lslash is now a bit too bold, make it just as bold as the
    middle element of the lowercase &#34;a&#34;. But the boldness in the uppercase
    Lslash is OK. Actually, in this particular typeface, you could add a little curliness
    to your slanted element in Lslash/lslash, just like in Martin Majoor&#39;s Seria:  <BR><a

    mean that you&#39;d have to make the endings of the lslash slanted element not
    completely vertical, but having a slight slant to the left &#40;just as much as
    in the lower part of the t or l&#41;. The curliness wouldn&#39;t have to be much,
    too, but it would add some nice native flair. However, making the slanted element
    straight as you made it is also fine and looks good. The figures look more comfy

  body: Forrest, <BR>I very much appreciate your comments on the Cyrillic!  Thank
    you for your well thought out suggestions. Since I am not a Russian speaker, I
    was most cautious about my drawing of the Cyrillic.  I felt uneasy departing too
    far from what was in my limited exposure to slavic languages. I really wanted
    this font to be as open to language difference as possible so I felt Cyrillic
    was a requirement--and still do. I do want to push the Cyrillic more as you suggest.  I
    would like to take you up on your generous offer to send scans of Pushkin and
    whatever handwriting and calligraphy you can spare. Also, if you know of any other
    good sources in print or online, please let me know. My Google search didn

    negatively is that &#39;de&#39; and &#39;el&#39; have too much empty space in
    the upper-left corner. Look at the text and you&#39;ll see that every time &#39;de&#39;
    or &#39;el&#39; appears inside the word, it creates a huge gap with the previous
    symbol. <BR>Second: usually Russian &#39;e reversed&#39; and Ukrainian &#39;ye&#39;
    are created by taking &#39;es&#39;=c and putting a dash inside to create a mirrored
    bottom part of e. They should not be left so open. <BR>All the rest looks quite

  body: "Chris, I found Mathew Carter's critique of your typeface really interesting--it
    helped me too. He said of some feature--one of the bent ascenders I think--that
    you don't really notice it text size, and if you don't see it, then you should
    cut that variation. The idea I carried away that when you do some design feature,
    it should be done with confidence, and to make a difference. That idea of being
    very intentional about making a difference with a design feature gave me a better
    concept myself. \r\n\r\nFollowing this up, I wonder what Leporello 'Straight'
    would look like. You is so polished and extensive, and that variant might be more
    quickly welcomed and have strong merits of its own, along with the 'bent' versions.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought. \r\n"

    take a closer look at the bottom bowl of your \xE6 glyph compare to the a. The
