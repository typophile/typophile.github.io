  has some nice insights to make this more interesting for me?\r\n\r\nFor instance..
  why do you like Garamond..\r\n\r\nOr Imprint..?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes help me!\r\n\r\nxo\r\n\r\nMargot"

    in love with the italic h of some Garamond font, and I've liked old style fonts
    ever since.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't like them, maybe you can write about your
    dislike or indifference."

  body: "@MargotHoltman \r\n\r\nBecause Garamond is one of the most legible typefaces.
    But the differences between the digital versions are big. My favorites are Merlo
    (Feliciano Type Foundry) and Stempel Garamond, followed by Berthold Garamond.
    I feel better with these Garamonds than with Sabon or Sabon Next. (And although
    I cannot exactly explain why, I dislike Garamond Premier.)\r\n\r\nHowever, a worthy
    digital successor of the original Garamond doesn\u2019t seem to exist."

  body: "This is like saying why do you love someone: if you don\u2019t feel it, it
    is hard to understand. I just love old-style fonts. Why? Well, I don\u2019t know,
    but they are elegant and classic, and I like that. And they first appeared in
    the most beautiful books ever printed (IMO).\r\n\r\nAnother approach: the letters
    reflect the age in which they were born. And the old-style fonts were born in
    the Renaissance age, one of the most important and interesting periods in history:
    Gutenberg, the discovery of America, Venice (Aldus!), protestantism\u2026"
