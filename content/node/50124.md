  body: "You're welcome.\r\n\r\nLES JOCKEYS reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nobodoni/floridium-nb/|Floridium]]
    from No Bodoni, especially because of the serif shapes, but it says it is based
    on wood types from the 1800s. \r\n\r\nThis typeface does look old, also reminiscent
    of DeVinne ornamental, but I cannot find it in any of my books.\r\n\r\n- Mike
