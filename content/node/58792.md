body: "Hi,\r\nSorry for the confusing header but I'm in desperate need for a quick
  answer...\r\n\r\nI'm about to purchase a font which is unfortunately not yet available
  in OpenType format. The options are: Mac Postscript, Mac TrueType, PC Postscript,
  PC TrueType. I use a Mac of course, but need cross platform as an option. \r\n\r\nNow,
  I know that Postscript is limited when it comes to cross platform, but TrueType
  was considered somewhat inferior in regards to output. \r\n\r\nMy question than
  would be, is this notion (that PS is superior to TT) still true or was this relevant
  only a while ago when Postscript was mainly identified as Mac and TrueType was mainly
  identified as PC (while OpenType was still in parturition), but nowadays that Mac
  OSX streamlined TrueType it is practically in the same league as Postscript which
  would mean that I can confidently purchase the Mac TrueType version - which would
  probably work cross platform without incident, and output just as fine as PS would.\r\n\r\nAs
  much as I've read about Postscript vs. TrueType I can't seem to find an updated
  conclusion.\r\nPlease help."

    the early 1990s. \r\nTake the Windows TrueType. It will work as smoothly as an
    OpenType font \u2013\_it just doesn't have OpenType features. \r\n(Mac Postscript,
    Mac TrueType, PC Postscript will not work cross-plattform) "

    knew that (always thought that TT by definition is cross platform).\r\nThanks
    for the quick response."
