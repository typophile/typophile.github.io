  would be greatly apprecaited.\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\nDanny[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lonewolfpatch_5397.jpg]"

    there is no current design patent on the design.\r\nIn sum the lettering is a
    pretty generic rendition of some 19th century \"Tuscan\" designs with \"median
    spurs\" -- the pointy bulges on the sides of the vertical strokes. Google Tuscan
    and you will find plenty from which to choose.\r\nDiscussion of another spurred
    font for jackets\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/103278\r\nDon"

  body: It's close but this one is not the same as the one for the Hells Angels. It's
    [[http://www.dafont.com/bosox.font|Bosox]] by Lee Gordon, most probably a digitization
    attempt of MLB Boston Red Sox jersey font.
