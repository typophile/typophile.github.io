body: Hello--I&#39;m new to this forum. I&#39;ve used FontMonger on a Mac off and
  on for years to make OSF versions of typefaces for book projects, and add ligatures,
  etc. Now I&#39;m composing type for books that need more stuff, like macrons over
  Os, etc. . . and I&#39;m sure FontMonger is going to stop working someday. What
  is the current program of choice for this kind of combining/editing job?Is TypeTools
  enough? I don&#39;t design new fonts--just mix &amp; match. I still use KernEdit
  to do my kerning on OS 9.2

  body: I too would love to find a copy of FontChameleon! <BR>I actually have FC 1.5
    &#40;the starter version&#41; for the Mac. I am VERY interested in purchasing
    either the pro version &#40;with all the type descriptors&#41; for EITHER Mac
    or PC, OR the additional type pack&#40;s&#41; for the 1.5 Mac version. I am VERY
    motivated to find one or both! If you have ANY information relating to locating
    a copy of FontChameleon OR the additional type library, please contact me.  <BR>Thanks
    so much for your attention, and any help you may be able to offer! <BR>Ken Ryan

    it is great but, no true italics.\r\nHow many fonts did 1.5 come with? I know
    1.5 pro came with 220 or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nRodi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set
    you free"

  body: pfaedit is now known as [[http://fontforge.sf.net/|FontForge]]. It is free,
    open source software that runs quite nicely on Mac OS X (10.3-ish and up) with
    X11, once you get used to its non-Mac-ness. It's updated and improved continuously,
    with full rebuilds on a nearly monthly basis.
