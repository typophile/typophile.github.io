  has a strong social-political statement dealing with our difficult economic situation
  as designers. It's in a time like this, being resourceful and recycling resources
  is a common trend for designers. I am thinking going \"all the way\" with this political
  statement by typesetting this project in default system faces with Times New Roman
  and Arial. Knowing that this would be a huge challenge, since many folks would agree
  these two faces are the most difficult to work with (right up there with Comic Sans
  and Hobo...) \r\n\r\nCan somebody suggest what they think about this? Since the
  audience for this piece will be for the design industry. Also anybody tried to work
  with these two faces and come up with very good result? Tips on how to work around
  their physical limitations will be be also appreciated!\r\n\r\nI am thinking going
  a bit of an experimental route now... Thanks"

  body: "I wouldn't say that they're difficult to work with. They actually compliment
    each other fairly well. They're harder to make UNIQUE, of course, given their
    ubiquity. \r\n\r\nFor a super challenge, incorporate MS Word clip art. ;o)\r\n\r\nI'm
    stuck with Arial as our corporate face at my current gig. I've actually warmed
    up to it for use online. I spent some time at 3M which was Helvetica + Times and
    even though I griped and whined about it at the time (being a pretentious intern)
    in hindsight, they manage to do just fine with those two faces. "

  body: "Why not show some solidarity with your brother and sister (type) designers,
    and use new fonts from independent foundries, not ones designed many years ago
    and owned by corporations (Monotype and Microsoft). \r\n\r\nIf you take the idea
    of re-use to its logical conclusion, you will end up with default system design
    that puts yourself out of work, as clients will be quite happy to re-use old layouts
    and concepts, for instance templates that came bundled with their software, set
    in, uh, Arial and Times...."

    to work with\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nAnyone who considers TNR or Arial difficult to
    work with isn\u2019t worth listening to. TNR is a dead-simple text face, there
    is no reason it should be any harder to use than Adobe Caslon. Which is probably
    why it\u2019s still incredibly popular for paperback books. As for Arial, once
    one gets past the really deformed characters, Arial is a very usable sans available
    in five weights, three widths, with monospaced and rounded versions. If you have
    trouble using that one it\u2019s time to head back to Typography 101 and do the
    damned homework this time around.\r\n\r\nEnough with the Arial/Time bashing. You\u2019re
    a student, not a bitter old designer; you should be focusing on the better options!
    Your work will be more interesting and useful to others if you work with the Cleartype
    fonts that ship with Vista and MS Office (and can be obtained for other Windows
    for free by installing the latest Powerpoint viewer). Or you could cover good
    low-cost fonts, such as Museo and Museo Sans, or the $9 versions of Nick Shinn\u2019s
    paradigm family. Try being creative instead of just digging up the old Times/Arial
    dirt that everyone has already seen and heard a million times."

  body: Or buy single weights of typefaces. Usually they sell for something like 30
    euros or similar. Even a designer on a budget can buy that. :)
