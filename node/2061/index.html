As you said its alot of information for a poster. Could you make the logos at the bottom of the page smaller? All those different designs are visually disturbing.

		<div class="commentbody">That is a lovely illustration. <BR>I think the sans vs. serif is working out. <BR> <BR>I think the composers name and the title could be a bit smaller. 80% of what you have now. and perhaps following the grid a bit tighter. <BR> <BR>In general I'm looking for you to shrink things down so that you create more white space. <BR> <BR>Possibly smaller body type by about the same %, but I'd keep the line spacing. <BR> <BR>Also try de-emphasizing <i>from</i>. Maybe bring the top of the A in Alice up to the Bottom of the S in Songs. Then fit the from in the hole between the i and g? You might need to either go with a heavier weight for the &quot;from,&quot; or possibly go lighter (just so it doesn't look close, but wrong). <BR> <BR>Ok. Let's get nitpicky: <BR>- More line spacing between the Dates (sans) and the Days. <BR>- Info &amp; Tickets phone numbers should all be flush left. <BR>- Are you allowed to jam all the logos together on the bottom? <BR> <BR>I think the layout you have going is a nice safe layout. Try something wildly asymmetrical (maybe using alice's line of vision to empasize the title in the opposite corner of the page). <BR> <BR>Not crazy about the colors. I'm seeing earth tones. Maybe a yellow ochre. Maybe and olive with a touch more green. <BR> <BR>Well. I've been staring at alphabets all day so I could be totally off base. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy</div>

There isn't any, said the March Hare. Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily. It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.

Randy's  <BR>remark and Loren's tinkering convinced me otherwise,  <BR>so thank you both. Also Eduardo was spot on with the  <BR>grid remark. On the other hand, it's always been my firm  <BR>conviction that the grid only stays in as long as it helps.  <BR>If it starts to hinder, fook it, as Noel Gallagher 'd say.</div>

There is too much screaming for my attention here.  <BR> <BR>Just wondering: Why is there info and tickets with different phone numbers for every event, jeez, that is not really user-friendly :-).  <BR> <BR>I'm wondering if the day (vrijdag) isn't a bit too close to the date and if the date per se isn't to big. Mrs. Eaves is overused, but not a bad choice for this job. (The spacing of that IS a bitch, though &ndash; and a job like this is quite worth transferring to Indesign if it's not just that one time you work for the client.) <BR> <BR>If it IS contemporary classical music, though, I think you should aim for something less retro, cooler, more layered and modern. I don't know if a this kind of retro look sends the right kinda message, but then again I don't know what kind of music is played. This kind of look would be wrong for the likes of Sch</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt; the skew on the title doesn't agree with me&hellip; it  <BR>just looks out of place.</i> <BR><i>&gt; Wow, I really like the skewed title.</i> <BR>Uh guys, could you try to agree please? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif" border=0> <BR>IMO the big plus of this scenario is that it gives a sense  <BR>of purpose to the whole lay-out, as I explained to  <BR>Randy earlier on. It conveys the &quot;Through the Looking  <BR>Glass&quot; symbolically, it creates a narrative as Alice  <BR>actually looks at the title and it also parallels the  <BR>whole &quot;skewed reality&quot; concept without having to do  <BR>anything too literal. <BR> <BR><i>&gt; the text on the bottom looks really crowded now</i> <BR><i>&gt; I agree with Chris, though, that the text at the bottom  <BR>is too heavy. Would doing it only in the Mrs. Eaves,  <BR>with caps for months work?</i> <BR> <BR>Well you can't win them all: the text at the bottom  <BR>is organized in a calmer fashion (less type sizes,  <BR>everything flush left, see HD's remark) and most  <BR>importantly leaves a maximum of white space available  <BR>for the thing that really needs to catch the eye of  <BR>the people: the illustration and the title. Setting  <BR>the dates in Gothic No. 13 allows me to control the  <BR>focus points: what do people need to learn when they  <BR>look from a distance? What is going on and when. Once  <BR>they're interested they can come closer and read the  <BR>rest of the information. I think it's difficult to do  <BR>better than that on a small poster (40x60 cm). <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">HD, I really appreciated your remarks too, very insightful,  <BR>but I'm starting to get the impression I'm spending  <BR>more time on this thread than actually designing the  <BR>friggin' thing! In a quicky: <BR> <BR>Re: too much information, simplify <BR> <BR>I did the maximum I could, but unfortunately everything  <BR>needs to be on there: three dates, three different  <BR>cities, and no other promotional material where  <BR>interested parties can get their information. Can't  <BR>be helped. It's up to me to find a adequate solution. <BR> <BR>Re: Mrs Eaves is overused <BR> <BR>Nobody told it was going to be like that when I  <BR>initially bought the license. I use it sparsely, and  <BR>I'd still like to get some mileage out of that purchase. <BR>I really like her. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Re: your whole style analysis <BR> <BR>The composer is a classical contemporary classical  <BR>composer (if you catch my drift) and uses a lot of  <BR>citations. I thought using period elements and  <BR>recombining them in a modern way would convey that. <BR> <BR>Re: their homepage <BR> <BR>Heh. Horrible innit? That's next on my list&hellip; if they  <BR>can free up some budget. <BR> <BR>Re: close-not-touching-feeling Gothic No. 13 <BR> <BR>-30/1000 Em did the trick, but it got a bit lost when  <BR>I 3Ded the whole thing. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif" border=0></div>
