  body: Don't know the original name, probably a photo-type/film font never digitized.
    To me, it looks close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica|Helvetica]]
    Condensed Black, mainly re-working /M centre vertex. The closest ready-to-go alternative
    I have is [[http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=16|Eldon]] WF.
