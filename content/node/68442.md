    (where he previewed the Helvetica flick) is a trade conference, not a StarWars
    convention.\r\nHe's leveraging professional organizations, not \"monetizing fanbases\".\r\nBut
    that that sounds cooler, ennit."

  body: "The term 'fans' is used in the context of social media. You can 'fan' an
    entity on facebook. You can 'follow' an entity on twitter. Etc.\r\n\r\nSo the
    point is completely valid. It's niche marketing made easier with technology. \r\n"

    facebook and twitter. It was built on the typophiles, and the fan-base term (in
    the way the writer uses it) puts us in the same bucket as these guys... http://www.film.com/features/story/the-five-most-rabid-fanbases/22494925

    case, marketing.\r\n\r\nMonetize originally meant turning metal into money. Minting
    coins. I guess having 18,000 followers is pretty close to that concept.\r\n\r\npbc"
