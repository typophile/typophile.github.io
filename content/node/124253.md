body: Hi! I've been working on a face with as little white space as possible while
  keeping both the stroke width and the white space width constant. What do you think
  of the result?

  body: "Pretty neat. Surprisingly legible.\r\n\r\nThere may be some call for the
    option of a \"barred I\" for uses that want total monospacing, or for the isolated
    word \"I\".\r\n\r\nThe stroke weight across the bottom of the ampersand is unusually
    shallow.\r\n\r\nI might suggest differentiating the zero as a closed loop with
    an isolated stroke in the middle. And close the loops in the percent too, because
    really, what are you even hoping to do there.\r\n\r\nCyrillic \u041F is not likely
    to be recognized at all. You're better off inverting a U for that.\r\n\r\nGreek
    is begging for a lowercase omega. Also consider the advantages of a lowercase
    lambda.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi! Thank you for your time and your helpful advice. I utilized most of it
    as seen here:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bez\_tytu\u0142u_5470.png]\r\nI
    was actually thinking at times about the barred I, but I didn't get to it before.
    I know this one is a little creepy, but it's the only way I could think of.\r\nI'm
    a little unsure about the 'lowercase' omega and lambda. I like them on their own
    (esp. the omega) but since I don't know Greek I have no idea how they would work
    among other 'not-so-lowercasey' characters. I can only hope they'd do just like
    their Latin equivalents. One thing that could be done is further case diversification.\r\nI'm
    rather reluctant about the \u041F though. Do you find the Greek pi unrecognizable
    as well? Whenever a glyph needed an extra stroke to fill in the whites, I seeked
    inspiration in handwriting, despite the somewhat technical/industrial appearance
    of the face. I thought it worked well for these two. I'm aware I might be alone
    in this belief, but wouldn't basing the \u041F on an inverted U make it too easily
    confused with the capital lambda?"

  body: "Handwriting, glad you mentioned it. Cyrillic cursive and italic forms have
    a number of interesting peculiarities, and among them is that \"\u043F\" becomes
    \"n\". So I meant to flip your \"u\" as it is, and the resulting \"n\" with the
    stem preserved may be the clearest possible solution. What you had was really
    an \"\u043B\" with a swash, which is not unheard of. You may get a number of other
    useful ideas by studying Cyrillic handwriting, and also a thing called vyaz, which
    is a historic kind of decorative space-filling blackletter.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    Greek \"\u03C0\", it is decipherable, but consider squaring off the top, and perhaps
    even mirroring it entirely."
