body: "Hey!\r\nI need some help with a poster I'm doing at typography, uni. I'm supposed
  to create a poster from 1920's about a Jazz/Charleston dance festival. It's about
  making people of today getting involved and passionated. \r\n\r\nSo I'm looking
  for a good font that might be from that era or maybe inspired from it. Also if anyone's
  good with coming up with names, I would be very pleased with name suggestions of
  this festival.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n/Anna Maria"
