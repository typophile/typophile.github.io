body: "This is really more a \xABlearning Fontlab\xBB-project than a serious typeface
  attempt. I didn't have any clear idea or sketches before i started, i just sat down
  and started drawing beziers. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, there's no metrics or kerning
  to speak of yet, and the hinting is horrible, frankly because i don't know how to
  do that stuff yet! First of all i wanted to get some feedback on the character widths
  and the general design of letters. Are there any letters horribly out of sync with
  the rest, that are too skinny/thick, etc. \r\n\r\nIf you have anything else to add,
  go ahead! Any and all insights will help!\r\n\r\nOoh, also, would it be correct
  to label this a neo-grotesk? That's just my uneducated guess. :)"
