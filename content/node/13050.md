  body: "Shame on them for lack of courage to use the type as it was designed. I'm
    sure it's a revival of a much older design, as Harold Lohner, like Nick Curtis,
    is a big fan of old lettering books.\r\n\r\nI just checked and he says it's from
    a '30's Speedball lettering book by Ross F. George, and it was called Vertical
    Script. He said 'it needed a lot of work'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
