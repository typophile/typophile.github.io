  in those dont match the sample. Nor do some characters.\r\n\r\nmy questions is,
  does this typeface exist as a font someplace? Or do you have any other information?
  much thanks for any help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LHH_4624.jpg]"

    is close\r\n\r\nespecially given the movie is from 1973 and pre-dig."

    see any alternates in my old (1985) Letraset catalogue. I wonder where it came
    from.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: WOW! Thanks Patty and Lex!  Lex, the capitol E is is different as well...and
    even other capitols where the middle part of the letter is justified higher. And
    thanks for pointing out the lowercase "e" as well, here is a zoom of the lowercase
    e if you have any indication of where they got it from...but overall this is pretty
    darned close, thanks to you both.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_5148.jpg]

  body: The R is kind of different too. I just think it's an earlier Lino cut that
    wasn't digitized. I don't think you'll find anything closer. Since the font is
    kind of dated looking it  doesn't seem likely to me that there would be a lot
    of variations available.

  body: agreed, it probably isnt digitized in this exact way yet. I went ahead and
    bought it, and will most likely make the changes myself. Any ideas on the little
    "e"? Do you think it was part of that old set or borrowed from a different typeface?

  body: It's from the same font, it's so close to the 'c'.
