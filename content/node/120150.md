body: "Hey Folks,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post here at typophile. I've been working
  for a long time trying to create a new font for the Rocky Horror community to use
  for their advertising. There already exists one font, Double Feature, that emulates
  the Rocky Horror credits, but I have found that it gets a little stale as there
  is only one alternate for each letterform, or sometimes none at all. In the actual
  credits everything was hand drawn, so every single character is different. I wanted
  to create a font that has at least four alternates for each character and allows
  a designer to immediately cycle through them without having to individually alter
  settings for each. To accomplish this I used and abused ligatures. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
  Shot 2014-10-03 at 12_5056.08.33 AM.png]\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the screenshot,
  I have it set up so that upper and lowercase characters are identical. My ligatures
  are set up so that a letter just has to be tapped repeatedly to cycle though the
  alternate options. In the case that the designer actually needs to repeat a letter
  they would have to switch between upper and lower case for the characters. This
  is probably a crude way of doing things, but it is working out how I envisioned.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Specimen_6131.jpg]\r\n\r\nI have hit
  a problem though. I also created alternate characters for the numbers, and had imagined
  to use them the same way, so that tapping either 1 or ! would first cycle through
  the \"1\" options and then set an exclamation point. However when I write the ligature
  code and attempt to compile with either numbers or symbols I receive errors. Is
  there any way to make them work, or could someone recommend a different way of achieving
  this?\r\n\r\nAlso, as I was searching around the forums to see if anyone had tried
  anything similar I noticed that the recommendation for naming ligatures is to either
  put an underscore or a period between the characters. Is this vital? As you can
  see my ligatures currently are just named A2, A3, A4 etc., and I haven't yet noticed
  and complications but I'd like to change it now if it is necessary.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nShawn"

  body: "Your numbers and symbols aren't working because you've given them invalid
    names. Glyph names have to be alphanumeric and start with a letter. Refer to the
    names of the original characters. I think you should be able to get away with
    \"one5\" even though the recommended format for a ligature would be \"one_one_one_one_one\".\r\n\r\nThe
    other allowed symbol, the period, would be used if you were setting up your alternates
    properly (and I understand why you won't be doing that). For example, \"one.ss02\",
    accessed by Stylistic Set 2, would be truncated back to \"one\" upon copying out
    plaintext.\r\n\r\nAnother problem I see is that your substitution order is upside-down.
    Bigger ligatures should go first, because if X X is already swapped out, X X X
    won't happen."
