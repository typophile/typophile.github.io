    speaking. The man behind Editions 205 is [[http://www.bureau205.fr|Damien Gautier
    of Bureau 205]], some of his typefaces are [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Damien_Gautier|commercially
    available]]. This one may be a bespoke typeface he created for the occasion. He
    may have started for instance with his [[http://www.bureau205.fr/colonel_article_f.html|Colonel]]
    and created a light rounded weight, some sort of DIN rounded stencil light. Try
    asking him, he may answer.\r\nSome alternatives, out-of-the-box: <strong>[[http://www.hypefortype.com/browse-fonts/what-s-hot/argn.html|ARGN]]</strong>,
