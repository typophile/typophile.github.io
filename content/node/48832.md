    brother of Ruse.\r\nJust can't remember the name of it."

  body: "Sorry! Forget it!\r\nI see now that the font used inside is FF Tisa, but
    that the heading (my sample) is some strange variation on it, so probably not
    a font.\r\nMaybe even what Artur suggested.\r\nThanks!"

    you have more samples for us?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

    is the one I was looking for: Tret.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in what magazine did you
    find this? I have seen the typeface used in some books published by Van Oorschot,
    but as far as I know it is not (yet) commercially avaiable.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

  body: "Artur, that was a great catch. You must know that book pretty well (Dutch
    Type) to recall the font from the one sample it contains. I'd be interested to
    know if Tret and others by Noordzij shown in that chapter are starting to make
    it into commercial use.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike,\r\n\r\nActually I recognized the design from an earlier publication
    called [[http://www.farhill.nl/04_books/contents/halet.html|Haagse Letters]] which
    also contains a specimen of Gerrit Noordzij's designs. Also, I've seen it in use
    several times in books published by Van Oorschot for whom Noordzij did (does?)
    a lot of book design.\r\nI don't know about plans for commercially publishing
    Tret, but I guess [[whttp:www.teff.nl|TEFF]] would be the place where to look
    for it.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"
