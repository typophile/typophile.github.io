  Bold</a>, which, oddly, has no zero, and I doubt a font that uncommon was used for
  this clock.

    have noticed before.

  body: Oh, but you notice those numerals once you start using them. These are the
    numerals for [[Sibylle Hagmann]]'s <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PChoU.html"
    target="new">Cholla Unicase</a>. We licensed the complete Cholla family a year
    or two ago. They seem a teensy bit bolder on the clock tho, and there is no bold
    weight with x-height numerals.

    stroke was applied.
