body: "The previous Glyphs/Fontlab topic was informative but I'd like to ask a question
  pertinent to my situation. \r\n\r\nI've been toiling away with TypeTool for a while
  and want to upgrade to a more comprehensive tool. I had always thought that FontLab
  was the obvious next step, but seeing the demo for Glyphs, I really like the interface
  and to be honest, the price. Should I just hold out for FontLab? Will Glyphs be
  a satisfactory move up?"

    do without Fontlab) or need access to existing Fontlab macros, there really is
    not reason to stick with Fontlab at this point.

  body: "It is always difficult to predict when the cows will come home. I don't think
    it is a case of predicting \"the winner\" among the choices out there and on the
    way.  I do think the honest competition is very healthy.  FontLab has enjoyed
    being the only show in town long enough that they have been too slow to update
    with the needs of their users. When Glyphs and RoboFont came along, they gave
    FontLab a much needed kick in the tail to get serious about improvement. All practitioners
    in any field do not confine themselves to only one tool, neither should you.  My
    hope for all developers is that they adopt the very adaptable UFO format as standard,
    at least as an import and export seamless function.  This would allow anyone to
    work with any set of tools they choose and not have to be saddled waiting for
    that long-promised version update to finally arrive (and pray that it is bug free).
    We all know the arguments about type designers and beginners being financially
    strapped but so are fledgling software developers (who are also type designers,
    btw).  As much as I have moaned about how font prices are too low, I cannot fairly
    expect the developers of the tools I need to bear the bourdon for me.  I know
    I have to bite the bullet and borrow money in meager times to pay them enough
    to survive as well.\r\nNone of us can predict which tool or combination will end
    up best for you and which will BE AVAILABLE in a reasonable amount of time to
    do us any good.  Do you bet on the older pride leader who is slower yet now worried
    about competition or the new young Lions out there with self-imposed eagerness
    yet fewer resources? You can guess and pick one now or support them all and help
    them grow into a healthy competitive system."

    says, you can edit advanced values (meta, name etc) by yourself, but you have
    to know the keywords. It's quite simple and good documentations are available
    online. \r\nThe bigger limitation, in comparison with Fontlab, is you can't export
    true type fonts nor old postscripts, but I think they're dying formats; UFO export
    is always possible.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never used this feature but manual hinting
    is also available in Glyphs. You have to disable \"auto hinting\" before exporting
    to keep your own hints."

    speed is counted in CPM (characters per millennium). I am also a horrible spelling
    afflicted geezer. If that is not bad enough, this new keyboard on the new iMacs
    is just enough smaller than the old one that I often miss keys completely.  If
    you combine that with \"maybe I was just thinking about bourbon\" it might lead
    you to the answer to your question ;-) \r\n\r\nEither that, or there is this French-like

    Glyphs </em>\r\n\r\nA very small minority, I think, and mostly only from curiosity.
    It should be said that the debate between FontLab and other tools on the Mac isn't
    due to the fact that most of those other tools are Mac-only, but also because
    the Windows version of FontLab is so much more stable than the current Mac release
    version, and in a Windows-centric font production workflow, e.g. involving VOLT
    and/or VTT, is well integrated.\r\n\r\nMy personal choice for primary font development
    tool on the Mac is the Windows version of FontLab running in Parallels. I use
    the RoboFab and UFOcentral scripts to integrate this into a UFO workflow (Prepolator,
    UFOstretch) on the Mac."
