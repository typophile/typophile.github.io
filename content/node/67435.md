  It doesn't have to be the same but suggestions of fonts with a similar style would
  be great.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_shot_2_3711.png]"

    Bold</a> to me (I'd presume the treatment being custom).\r\nThe \"IN\" btw is
    also from Brothers (<a href=\"http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?PBroW.html\">Word
    Logos</a>)."

  body: "Hi Tyler,\r\nno offense, but these \u2018free fonts\u2019 look like rip-offs
    of (rather) well-known commercial typefaces to me.\r\nFurthermore, that \u2018#6\u2019
    isn\u2019t similar to Brothers at all. For the record: it is [[Aldo Novarese]]\u2019s
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/estro/?refby=mfde\">Estro</a>.\r\nF"

    Declaration]], in case anyone wondered about that.\r\n\r\nAnother font somewhat
    similar to the customized Brother, which I agree is the right answer, is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/abaton/|ITC
    Abaton]], which already has the lines on the letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
