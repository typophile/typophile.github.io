body: "Hi,\r\n\r\n   I am new to the forum and wanted some help from some of the veterans
  here :) I am involved in \"whitebox\" testing and want find out a way to find:\r\n\r\n1)
  The font size,color and style for a web page for the various fonts used on that
  page. \r\n2) The pixel count between two points on the screen. \r\n\r\n\r\n  I have
  found some pixel ruler but that does not look very user friendly, so pls let me
  know if there is some good tool available for both of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would
  also appreciate if anyone can suggest some way of doing such a testing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVeebhor"
