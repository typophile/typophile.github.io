    particular letters. The <a href=http://typedesign.com/logos/chicago.html>Tribune
    nameplate</a> is by Jim Parkinson, as are many other <a href=http://typedesign.com/contents.html>blackletter
    nameplates</a>. \r\n\r\nFor a classic textura (the variety of blackletter most
    of these nameplates are), my favorite is <a href=http://www.p22.com/lanston/goudytext.html>Goudy
