    Mike F]], original should \"appear in the Solotype Catalog (predigital) as Jason\".
    Digitizations: [[http://www.dafont.com/nite-club.font|Nite Club]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/nocturne|Nocturne]]
    (a bit different?)\r\nRESTAURANT & BAR: can't identify it positively at this size
    but I guess [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic|Century
    Gothic]] (probably this one) should do the job"
