  typeface.\r\nIs this available anywhere, and if not - is there anything close to
  it?\r\nMy sincerest thanks,\r\nElton\r\n"

    entered those letters of epson.gif supplied by you here:\r\n\r\nwww.linotype.com/de/22/fontidentifier.html\r\n\r\nBut
    this font identifier did not find a <strong>single</strong> matching font.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    it is very likely that Epson modified and mixed the letters of <strong>different</strong>
    existing fonts, for example the font \"Handel Gothic\", whose figures \"1\" and
    \"2\" and whose letter \"L\" are very similar.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Uli,\r\nThanks ever so much for taking the trouble.\r\nBy looking at it,
    I would have guessed that  it's something tailor-made for EPSON.\r\nAnd yes, it
    does have certain Handel Gothic allusions.\r\nAdditional pointers welcome, my
    type darlings!\r\nAlways yours, Elton"
