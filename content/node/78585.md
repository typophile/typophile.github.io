  I am running a web design business, but rarely venture out into logo design.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo should be as simple as possible, so as to not distract from the portfolio on
  my website. It shouldn't be too high either, so it fits neatly in the header of
  the website.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think that I am on the right track
  here or what could be improved.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6500.png]"

    can't spin! :)\r\nDon't take it the wrong way. but have you considered talking
    to a logo designer? Some of the guy are incredible at twisting their brains and
    conceptualizing... you said you wanted it memorable, in which case it really needs
    an outstanding concept on top of great execution. \r\n\r\nWhat I am getting at
    is that a pair of gears is not exactly memorable, it needs something else, an
    AHA moment. For example, quirky locked-up gears could actually work if the lock-up
    condition is emphasized (and coupled with a semi-humorous tag line), but then
    it becomes a perception issue of your company being great at design but ignorant
    of engineering details. Another idea to explore would be to try and build gears
    out of, say, ampersands... \r\n\r\nIn short - you need a better concept."

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. Yes, Alaskan is totally right. I have
    already redesigned this about five times already. Designing a logo for yourself
    can be quite tricky... I should really get a professional and pay him / her..."
