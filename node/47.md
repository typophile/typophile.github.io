body: This is a typeface I began after an inspiring tour of Iceland. Initially, I
  was only interested in spelling the name of the country, but I have continued to
  work with the letterforms and now find myself with a monocase alphabet and some
  rudimentary numbers. <BR> <BR>Again at this point I am wondering if it is worth
  filling in the gaps in this typeface and whether there is a market for a titling
  face like this in today&#39;s type market. <BR> <BR>your comments will be greatly
  appreciated. <BR> <BR>thanks, Nicholas. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1024.gif"

  body: ' Nicholas - This is nasty good stuff. And nice craft pulling it off. There
    should be more monocase fonts &#40;or unicase&#41; on the market. And there&#39;s
    not enough icelandic inline/gothic fonts out there either.<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Certainly t26 would be interested in something like this.
    Or IHOF. &#40;Look at James Grieshaber&#39;s excellent Gothic Gothic&#41;. I don&#39;t
    see it as short-lived &#40;Hrant do you mean here today, gone tomorrow?&#41;.
    I see it as a niche face in a more classical sense. For example, Downer&#39;s
    Ironmonger is a niche typeface that people would use when appropriate, but nobody
    is going to log on and buy it for run-of-the-mill work. <BR> <BR>Nice work. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>BTW, a member of this forum is Phil Foss&reg;. Maybe you can work out
    a royalty arrangement. <BR> <BR>Phil? <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' I guess Iceland have some extra characters u should take care of. This is
    nice to carve in wood I guess..or any other material. <BR> <BR>Try remove the
    thin inline and get an even nicer version, and try to take away everything except
    the thin inline and you get a third version of your font. This is a 3 in 1 package.
    I prefer the version where you remove the inline.  <BR> <BR>Sbo '

  body: 'thanks for all the input so far. I knew that if I posted my work I would
    get a great response from this community. <BR> <BR>Phil - I adopted the Icelandic
    word for waterfall &#40;Foss&#41; as the name for this face, as they were so prevalent
    and spectacular over there. It also didn&#39;t hurt that it was one of the few
    pronouncable words I found in Icelandic. <BR> <BR>If you are interested in a distraction,
    the photo gallery that this type was created for can be found here: <A HREF="http://feltron.com/island"
    TARGET="_top">http://feltron.com/island</A> <BR> <BR>I love the 3 in 1 suggestion,
    so I&#39;ve got a lot of work ahead, but the murmurs of approval are inspiring.
    <BR> <BR>thanks, nick.'
