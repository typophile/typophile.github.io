body: "hi everybody,\r\n\r\ntheses last weeks i've been in the exausting process of
  make the demand of a patent about a new way to interact with touch surfaces (wich
  includes touch screen devices like iphone)\r\n\r\nBasically, the technology create
  vectors who gives a direction and a amplitude. When you touch the screen a first
  coordinate is computed once and when you drag a second coordinate is computed and
  recomputed as long as you maintain the drag.\r\nThe vector is made from the two
  coordinates as long as you touch the screen.\r\n\r\nWith friends we made a brainstorming
  about the name and we got  Virtual Touch Technology. The patent will be eventually
  divide in two patent, one for Virtual touch Techology and one for Virtual Touch
  Pad (wich is a configuration of two vector for playing Doom like games or control
  planes)\r\n\r\ntheses are some illustrations comming with the patent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vtouchtech_6056.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  goal of the logo is to try as much as possible describe the technology and the origin
  of the patent, Switzerland.\r\nTheses are somes trial logos.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/virtualtouch_4918.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/virtualtouch01_6309.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/virtualtouch02_3877.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think (if you understand the technology) ?"

  body: "I know a thing or two about patents and what not, so a couple of off-topic
    comments if you don't mind. \r\n\r\n1. I assume you realize that you just made
    a \"public disclosure\" of the idea, meaning for example that you now have a year
    in the US/Canada to file for a patent.\r\n\r\n2. The idea itself is probably not
    patentable to begin with. This is because it does not include an \"inventive step\",
    i.e. something that makes the invention \"non-obvious to those skilled in art\".
    The model of control you are describing (if I understand it correctly) has been
    used before, both in games and professional apps. Specifically I am pretty sure
    the (click-hold-and-then-move-mouse-to-define-a-vector) controls were used in
    a game called Homeworld back in late 90s, early 00s.\r\n\r\n3. You may want to
    flip through Synaptics and Apple patent portfolios. Even if they don't have this
    specific idea patented, it might be easily added to one of their pending apps.
    This is a very nasty patent abuse practice called \"submarine patents\", and this
    is exactly why you shouldn't be making _any_ public disclosure of the idea before
    you file.\r\n\r\n"

    and was deposit in the US, i'm totally protected.\r\ni work with a patent Information
    Technology specialist company, we got through basical 800 patents including Apple.\r\nAs
    they were somes 3'500 patents about the subject, i'm not sure, and can't be because
    for patent there is a 18 month secret so\r\nanyway this process is a bit like
    poker. They may be patent about similar process, but i just give a glance of my
    invention it's more\r\ncomplex and more complete than it seems,it's hard to resume
    20 pages in few lines event the illustration i show are incomplete.\r\n\"innovative
    technology\" is the name of this kind of patent, the subcategory if you like.\r\nAnd
    i will use this patent in games since with friend we're in the process of making
    games for iphone, i'm not doing parking technology.\r\nThanks for your concern
    about public disclosure, but it's been a three month process in wich i have to
    shut my mouth, now i can talk about it the patent is file and have other person
    opinion about it. i had a shock past week end because a game was show with a similar
    tech, in finality it was just a drag & drop tech not a presistant movement like
    my tech.\r\n"

  body: "Ok, cool. Great to hear that you have things under control and the patent
    has more flesh to it that it seems from the first glance. Looking forward to reading
    it ;-)\r\n\r\nRegarding the mark - I think a Swiss Cross based icon is a way to
    go. That really binds the name, the domain and the logo together. The sticking
    out arrow though doesn't seem to be working, at least not in its current thin
    pointy form.\r\n\r\nRegarding the type - if words are capitalized, I don't think
    they need to have different weights. The trailing thin part with a dot in it kind
    of throws the type of the balance. Basically there's just too much going on in
    the right part of the type."

  body: "mmmhhh... i though that arrow was a good thing because this is the basic
    of the tech, while dragging your finger, you create a vector that indacte a contstant
    deplacement in a direction.\r\ni had tough (not tried yet) of a curvy line, more
    alive, more natural, but then i though that i'll separate the VirtualTou.ch (wich
    is the basics, and can be applied a thousand different manner) and the VirtualTouchPad
    (wich will be more for Games or navigating\r\nin a 3D space, like a 3d starmap).
    And considering that my though was to minimalize the VirtualTou.ch logo to the
    basic and make someting more lively for the VirtualTouchPad.\r\nBut i will reconsider
    all that considering your comments because it's really a natural way of manipulation
    3d, a can be very quick reacting for games (like quake or doom like, or 3rd person
    shooter like Gears of War) and have a very smart ways to substitute buttons like
    ie: maintaining triggers for shooting, or activating booster.\r\nBut my original
    idea (wich may be wrong) was to do a technical logo that (when you know the technology)
    helps remeber what is it about, and is targeted to technical people at big companies
    like EA or Nokia or HP for example, not gamers, and make something quite sober,
    then the idea of the .ch thing came and i choose to add color and make the cross
    bolder to match the Switzerland identity."

    Innovative look visually off-balance.

    on the cross make it look busy (that not even getting into it looking like a game
    console control buttons). They are a decoration that adds nothing to the logo,
    and creates scalability problems. The big arrow and cross combination feels forced
    and geometrically unbalanced. Rather than creating a feeling of something dynamic
    the arrow simply \"sticks out\". \r\n\r\nThe type looks foreign to the mark -
    the mark is bold and fleshy, and the type is anorexic. Also the black/white treatment
    is visually disturbing. The capitalization, the dot, the colors - there is just
    too much going on for a simple line of text.\r\n\r\nJust look at your own personal
    logo. It is head and shoulders above this one. Perhaps consider making just a
    wordmark and incorporating Swiss Cross into it ?\r\n"
