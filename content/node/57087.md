body: "I posted this in the teacher's original post, but decided to go ahead and post
  it on my personal blog as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTC_all_3843.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
  we began this assignment, our professor had us create letters with everyday household
  objects. My object happened to be pills, hence the name OTC for my typeface. I really
  enjoyed this project, and in the beginning thought it would be easier than it was.
  I could definitely spend months perfecting OTC, and have gained a new respect for
  typeface designers that can spend day after day, week after week, ect., looking
  at the same typeface.\r\n\r\nI knew that the basis of my typeface would be the oval
  pill shape. Creating such a bold typeface would limit OTC's usage to display only.
  During the creating process I knew that the overall shapes would create a typeface
  that had a futuristic feel. That's why I chose a passage from 1984 to illustrate
  different sizes and ways that OTC could be used. I chose the cool color palette
  to illustrate a technology/futuristic feel within the poster. I stuck with mostly
  type to present my typeface, because I felt that Orwell's words carried a certain
  power behind them that needed little imagery to push my concept. I did however put
  a vector image that I created with my original pill shape and circles to give the
  poster a slight added depth.\r\n\r\nOur professor had us create three stories for
  our typeface. The story we chose for mine was that it was created in the future
  to brand people's identities, and it evolved into the Orwell theme. I think it's
  interesting to think of how people will be identified in the future and what form
  our identities will take. We already are labeled  with numbers and letters, but
  what is our identity? That was the exciting part of creating the typeface was seeing
  the evolution of the letter's from their original form to the finished project.\r\n\r\nI
  am really happy with how my poster and typeface turned out, and would like to continue
  to work with it. (Maybe a summer project, eh?)  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTCPOSTERB_5270.png]"
