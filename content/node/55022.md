body: "I have tried tirelessly and cannot identify this font. My client has no files
  to do so. The printer who designed it and handled all of the files went bankrupt
  and is MIA. All I can tell is that it has similarities to Americana and certain
  versions of Palatino.\r\n\r\nThe \"Q\" is qhat throws me. I cannot find a match.
  Please help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
