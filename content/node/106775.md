  body: "Can't find a perfect match, none that could match /K, /R and digits at the
    same time. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-pro|Akzidenz
    Grotesk Condensed]] is the closest I've found but still mismatching on /K/R/digits
    and weight. I guess, part of providing better samples (more complete, bigger...)
    and the sample origin, your best chance is probably to find and directly contact
    the person in charge of this work.\r\nSome more similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/wearetrippin|WeAreTrippin]],
