body: "I have a client that is asking me to help identify this san serif typeface.
  I'm stumped. I've done all of the usual searches and gone through my own and my
  studios rather well-stocked type library and have come up empty handed. Notice the
  odd double-storey \"a\" and square dot on the \"i?\" Can anyone offer suggestions?
  Any help is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards, David"

  body: There's something funky going on down in the lower right hand corner of the
    "a". Makes me think that someone modified an existing typeface.

  body: "Exactly. With maybe a very small dash of Bell Gothic thrown in for good measure.
    I'm looking through Veer right now but not finding anything. I get the feeling
    that someone also horizontally scaled the font in; the \"u\" \"r\" \"t\" and \"o\"
    seem unnaturally narrow.\r\n\r\nGreat forums and site, btw. This place will be
    a daily visit.\r\n\r\nRegards, David"

  body: "The symmetrical form of the \"u\" is very unusual for lowercase. Jeremy Tankard's
    \"Corbel\" is the only such \"u\" which comes to my mind.\r\nAll of which to say:
    Looks like something someone hacked together from Myriad, to my eyes."

  body: "Thanks, Chester. I'm leaning towards a hacked version of Myriad Pro myself
    but there are so many little \"almost there\" things about this logo's specific
    type that are nagging at me. Just tiny little elements of lots of other modern
    san serif faces. I'll keep hunting and play a bit in Illustrator to see if I can
    match it somewhat.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help. Keep me posted if you stumble across
    anything else.\r\n\r\nRegards, David\r\n\r\nPS. Wasn't there a program back in
    the early 1990s that did what you mentioned earlier ... merged two typefaces to
    create a new one? I'm getting old and forgetting such things.\r\n\r\nPPS. I see
    what you mean about Corbel but the \"o\" is the wrong shape. Maybe Corbel + Dax
    + Myriad? :-)"

  body: Just about any font software will let you "blend" fonts. Which is how I -
    and many of my collegues - start interim weights of typefaces. If you blend a
    couple of existing fonts, you can get some very interesting fonts, but the results
    usually look mangled, but not like the sample you have posted. This was purposefully
    cut'n'pasted, either by a graphic designer or an amateur type designer.

  body: "Here's what I think happened to this font...\r\na _ the bottom right corner
    was completely cut up and altered.\r\nt _ the left \"serif\" was amputated, and
    the angle of the top may have been steepened.\r\nu _ the right side of the letter
    was deleted, and the left side was mirrored and joined."

  body: "I agree on the \"t\" and \"u\". It also seems to share some characteristics
    with Frutiger Bold Condensed of all things. I may be on a wild goose hunt here
    but maybe the \"a\" comes from another font altogther. The bowl of the \"a\" is
    just all wrong compared to the rest of the letters (to these old eyes, any way).\r\n\r\nI
    have Fontographer from way back (1997?) but haven't yet updated to the new OSX
    version. Soon, perhaps."

  body: "Got it! It is indeed Frutiger Bold Condensed, ever so slightly tweaked. I'm
    just working in Illustrator here and it matches with only a very few odd little
    modifications ... the main one being the \"a\".\r\n\r\nThanks for all the insight
    and help, Chester."

  body: "I agree as well.  It looked like a bastardized version of Frutiger to me,
    too. It was the vertical end to the top storey of the a that did it for me; Myriad's
    a would have had a forward-leaning angle.\r\n\r\n\r\nMike"
