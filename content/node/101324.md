  body: Hard to say, very few letters and not so distinctive. Something between Helvetica
    and DIN so may be [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat|Akkurat]].

  body: Already had a look to the website and that's why I said Akkurat. Have you
    even try it using their TypeWriter? Because, this is very close if not matching.
