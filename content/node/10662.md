  <BR>Are they all the same font being distributed by different foundries, or are
  they differing digital interpretations developed from the same pre-digital source?
  <BR> <BR>Some of my weights seem to be labeled Monotype, some seem to be labeled
  Adobe, and I am trying to get a client to buy the same fonts I have for a PC. <BR>
  <BR>Help!'

  body: You are spot on about the two possibilities. Here&#39;s where my FontShop
    background comes in handy. <BR> <BR>Monotype Grotesque was originally issued as
    a digital version by Monotype Typography themselves. As their version predates
    the Adobe release AND the Adobe version sports the MT appendix, I&#39;m led to
    believe that this is one of the type families where Adobe acquired the digital
    version from Monotype and included it in their own type library. For example the
    Adobe Gill Sans fonts are identical to the Monotype versions and can be mixed.
    Just as the Berthold fonts in the Adobe Type Library which were labeled BE were
    the actual Berthold outlines. <BR>Agfa on the other hand did nothing more than
    include the Adobe Type Foundry into their own type library, so there you would
    simply have Adobe versions of fonts packaged in Agfa boxes and floppy disks. <BR>
    <BR>That was the situation in the mid-nineties. The current situation with the
    merger of the Agfa and Monotype Type Libraries and the changed agreements between
    Adobe, Agfa and Monotype is not so clear, but I&#39;m quite positive that this
    story still holds true for Monotype Grotesque. I&#39;d suggest you stick to one
    library though.
