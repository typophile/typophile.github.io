body: "I apologize before hand if this isn't the right place for this question. I
  was asked by a friend to design a logo for his girlfriend's handmade jewelry company.
  The logo needs to reflect femininity, luxury and taste. But I also want it to have
  a slight whimsy to it as these are handmade pieces. I'm looking for a delicate,
  airy typeface (possibly a hand drawn style). I have a sample below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/miette_logo_3833.gif]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can suggest any typefaces or move this topic to the correct board, I would
  be most grateful."

    a symbol of Feminity and taste. However, it would quite interesting to know a
    bit more about the area where she is going to open this jewellery, the type of
    customers and jewellery that she is thinking to sell. This is just an observation.
