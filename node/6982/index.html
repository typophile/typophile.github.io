		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What are traps?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inktraps. This term originally referred to those parts of a letter in which there was a tendency for ink to build up. Tight angles, such as the inside of the bottom of the letter v can be inktraps. The problem is exacerbated in some printing processes, by ink consistency, and also by the heaviness of coverage; it is particularly problematic in heavy types such as black sans serifs. Nowadays, the term is often used, as Tiffany and Hrant are using it, in reference to the technique used to correct letterforms to avoid this problem. This typically involves taking a nick out of the ink trap area to compensate for the build up of ink, or otherwise lightening that part of the letter, e.g. by tapering stems as in the v shown above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Sans is a Multiple Master font that includes a weight axis from very light to extremely black. The inktrap correction becomes much more obvious as the weight increases.</div>

In the photo days they used to make really explicit ones - which made letterforms look like miniature devils! And actually if you look at the initial sketches of Meta (which can be seen in David Earls's new book), you'll see very sharp nicks all over. Even Optima can be said to have subtle nicks (although Optima Next has had them all shorn off). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* BTW, I prefer the term &quot;thorn&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Why would they make nicks in the photo days?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald, nicks were used in photofilm for essentially the same reason that &quot;ink traps&quot; were used in metal, only in reverse. If you project light through an open shape with an acute angle, the light will tend to make the corner round. My recollection of physics and optics is a little fuzzy, but I think the phenomenon is called &quot;diffraction&quot; (or is it &quot;diffusion&quot;?). This is basically the same principle that causes dappled light filtered through trees to appear as round, circular projections on the ground, even though the openings between leaves are random polygonal shapes. I believe the degree of rounding varies depending upon the thickness of the film substrate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can try this experiment: Take a piece of card stock (a 3x5 index card works well) and cut a square opening in it, say half and inch or so. Place the card on a piece of paper and shine a desk lamp directly over it. Now, lift the edge of the card just slightly so that you can peek under and see the projected square of light on the paper. You'll notice that the corners of the projected square are not sharp. The closer the card is to the paper the sharper the image, but there will still be slight rounding in the corners. Nicks were used to compensate for this rounding. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Karen, a &quot;nick&quot; &ndash; Hrant's &quot;thorn&quot; is a little more descriptive &ndash; is where an outside corner is exaggerated in its sharpness.  It's basically the negative image of the &quot;trap&quot; discussed above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope that's clear. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
