Any interesting stuff at all on Annlie would be gratefully recieved.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I came across this site whilst googling &lsquo;Fred Lambert&rsquo; to accompany my entry on Friends Reunited. Fred was a Typo teacher at the London School of Printing and Graphic Art at Back Hill in Clerkenwell when I was a student there in the 1950&rsquo;s. 
He designed Compacta to be used as a bold face in a narrow area. When I used it via Letraset you had to lift it of the sheet onto a screen by wetting it and then transfer it to the design. Fred was English and lived in west London I believe. The last time I saw him was in Heneky&rsquo;s pub in Old Brompton Road in West London in 1968 when he insisted on buying my wife and myself a &lsquo;wedding breakfast&rsquo; as we had recently married. Heneky&rsquo;s was a favourite watering hole for the upcoming design and art fraternity then, (and I think still is), and many now famous names passed through it&rsquo;s doors. Fred was a really nice guy and was very patient with all of our laboured attempts at hand lettering. He tended to smoke a lot and always wore a corduroy jacket. 
Harry Beck the designer of the modern London Underground map, and Tom Eckersley the poster designer also taught there at that time.</div>
