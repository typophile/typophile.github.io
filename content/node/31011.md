body: "In recent weeks, I've been doing some research on older typographic subjects
  and a thought popped into my head. We should have a all-inclusive online type museum
  with high quality scans of classical materials as well as a wiki-like setup. Think
  of the possibilities. We could cross reference all of the newer type revivals with
  the old stuff. It would also make finding rare type specimens a cinch. This would
  not only be beneficial to type designers or graphics people, but also the whole
  world in general. Need a font from the 1400's? look it up on the site. See how it
  was used. I think it could be brilliant.\r\n\r\nAnyone want to help?\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to get this going.\r\n\r\n"

    is some data in there, check out the pages on Gutenberg and Luca Pacioli.\r\n\r\nI'm
    hoping to get many more high quality images and information from people like you
    on there."

  body: This sounds like a cool idea, but wouldn't you run into the possibility of
    legal copyright issues? One of the reasons why some universities are hesitant
    to put their full collections online is because of copyright and estate issues...

  body: "No museum is ever complete... \r\n\r\nI do think it would be good to clear
    on emphasis. Would this be especially academic? For the novice? Mostly for designers?
    Mostly for type designers? Obviously no choice precludes the others but it could
    help with UI issues, the tone used in texts etc. \r\n\r\nAlthough I suppose that
    the wiki model does split the difference pretty effectively. \r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of which, why not just add to the Wikipedia?"

  body: "I'm sure there could be copyright issues, but not if the things inside the
    museum are in the public domain or donated from other online resources.\r\n\r\nSince
    I am in the business of designing type, I envision this can be a resource for
    type designers first, then students, the public etc. second.\r\n\r\nI just like
    the idea of a singular resource where it's not possible for links to images to
    be broken, tiny etc. Most of the historical type info out there is poorly scanned
    and tiny. I'm not sure but it seems like wikipedia mostly links to external sources
    where links are easily broken.\r\n"

    I bet.
