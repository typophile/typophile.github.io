  to identify this typeface - is it one typeface or has it been put together with

  body: "It's a single typeface: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=FontShop&ffam=Disturbance%20-%20Regular&fid=23ae0fa938ba4aa68b5b82ceeac9ad21&fsize=60&text=BURKE%20NIAZI&fit=1|FF
    Disturbance]]</strong> by Jeremy Tankard (FontFont, 1993)\r\nLower & Capital letters
    are the same for this font, so you can get this result by setting the text to
    \"burke niazi\", \"BURKE NIAZI\" or even \"BuRkE nIaZi\""
