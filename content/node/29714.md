    a T-26 hunch turned up empty too.\r\n\r\nThe 'arthritic knuckle' look of the 'm'
    is what seems most familiar, but I haven't been able to pick the right place to
    look. Something is telling me to check Veer, but I am having trouble getting the
    site to cooperate.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: ":^)  anyway, I did check Veer and nothing came of it. I also browsed Psy-Ops
    and a bunch of other foundries. I checked both Indie Font Books. I really think
    I've seen this before, but I'm running out of ideas for places to look.\r\n\r\nI
    hate these kinds of nagging ID quests. I wish someone would step in and put me
    out of my misery on this one. It's like hearing a bit of a tune that you can't
    think of the name of.\r\n\r\nToo bad sites don't let you search by 'rounded stroke'.
    This one would pop right up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    This one would pop right up.\r\n\r\nMany can do that now. One of the reasons that
    leads me to think this is not from a major reseller, if it exists as a font at
    all.\r\n\r\n> I hate these kinds of nagging ID quests.\r\n\r\nDitto. Aren't we
    sick?"
