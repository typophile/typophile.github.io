  turning up anything either.  I'm sure this has been covered some where in these
  forums, but for the life of me, I can't find it.  I'm a noob, and the resources
  I've found in books and on the Internet haven't been terribly explicit on this.
  \r\n\r\nShould [[bullet|bullets]] be hung in the gutter beyond all of the text,
  OR should they align with the header and body copy, OR should they be indented.
  In the latter two options the bullets would be hung beyond the bulleted text, but
  not the regular body copy.  The first one it would be hung all the way out into
  the gutter, beyond the grid. \r\n\r\nI'm being redundant because I'm trying to be
  clear.   \r\n\r\nMy first impression was that they should be hung all the way out
  the gutter, and the bulleted text should remain aligned with regular text, but now
  I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAlso, an en-dash between the bullet and the text?\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate the education I didn't receive in college. \r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n  "

  body: No. The bullets should not go into the gutter. You need that. What you do
    is indent the left margin in by the width of a bullet and a space, and then you
    hang the bullet and the space into the resulting indent. End the indent when the
    bulleting ends.

  body: "I tend to go with Option 1, indent and align. I think it makes the information
    easier to scan through. However, it does get confusing if you have multiple levels
    of indenture (I've had a document with 6 starting I. A. 1. a. i. 1.) ), so having
    hanging bullets/numbering does make things cleaner.\r\n\r\nI would consider this
    decision to be at the designer's discretion. Thought, if someone disagrees I'd
    be very interested in hearing the reasoning (for or against). I also didn't learn
    everything I probably should have while in school."

  body: "There is no rule. Each job will have different possibilities. As Dan says,
    if you have a wide enough gutter so the bullets will not get lost in the bind
    or trim, then they can hang. & that is a perfectly fine position for them, as
    long as the rest of the design, the design as a whole, supports this position.\r\n\r\nAn
    en space is a very good idea.\r\n\r\nAnother good idea is to use a center dot
    instead of a bullet. 99% of bullets are way too fat. Of course, for a lot of uses
    the center dot may be too small. In that case I like to scale the bullet down
    or the dot up to some middle weight. Or screen the bullet or run it as a softer
    color to lessen its impact.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Thanks for the responses. Very enlightening.  \r\nI've done it both ways
    in the past, and wasn't sure if either one was correct. I like Option 1 simply
    because it's easier to set, and won't get messed if there are content changes
    in the document later on down the line. \r\n\r\nWhen I did hang the bullets in
    the gutter in the past, I either put the bulleted text in a separate text box,
    and moved it's x-location to the left and then tabbed the bulleted text to line
    up with the rest, or I added each of the bullets manually in separate boxes.  Neither
    way was very ideal since the copy I get to begin with hasn't been finalized. It's
    a pain, but I do like the way it looks.  \r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks again everybody
    for the input.  This had been bugging me. \r\n\r\nKevin"

  body: "Two things to say here:\r\n\r\n#1:\r\nYES: the smaller bullet is also known
    as a centered period. & Yes: it is at shift+option+9 on a Macintosh. I don't know
    from Windows.\r\n\r\n#2:\r\nIf you get deeper into your program, and use a variety
    of indents, you will not need to drop the bullet list into a separate text box.
    Then you can keep all text in the same text flow, and as you make changes to text
    before the bullets, you'll not need to move that box by itself.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"
