		<div class="commentbody">Someone a little more knowledgeable about the format can probably correct me but, from what I understand, the LAB format was developed precisely to be an intermediary between the reflective (CMYK) and transmitted (RGB) color models. We have a Heidelberg Quickstep scanner at work (a poky, but very precise $25K number) that by default scans in LAB, evidently precisely for this reason: the finished product can be converted to either RGB or CMYK, and there won't be any noticeable color shift. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that, if LAB can go either way with minimal damage done, the best path from RGB to CMYK is through LAB. Or so GATF says...but it seems to work for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is truth in that, however inevitably there will be some colors which are achievable in CMYK & not RGB & some in RGB that cannon be reproduced in CMYK. This is true no matter what process is used. These process are there to help steer away from problem color values - at least in part. 

When you consider pantone or other inks alone or combined into CMYK the range of possible overlaps is bigger in both directions but that is getting *much* fancier. It is also true that many RGB colors can still not be made in Pantone or any ink & that many Pantone ink colors cannot be made in RGB.</div>

those non-cmyk colors will look dull in CMYK. Your biggest problem is lack of contrast, as those colors end up mid-tone in CMYK. So what looks like a nice electric green on a darker red background will come out with similar tones.

So either nip the problem in the bud and don't use those RGB-only colors in the first place for twin-media projects (familiarize yourself with those colors), or else add some trickery in the print job -- dropshadows and outlines -- for problematic juxtapositions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you try this yourself in Photoshop you can see the difference in the preview (not that I'm recommending soft proofing). What it does with the out-of-gamut colors depends on the "Rendering Intent" you have selected. Instead of just selecting "Image > Mode > CMYK," choose "Convert to Profile" and you can pick from 3 or 4 "Rendering Intents." 

Also, when you convert from RGB to CMYK in Photoshop, it actually goes RGB to LAB to CMYK. You don't see that step, though.

		<div class="commentbody">I have the most trouble with reds from a digital camera. I've often developed custom curves to alter a copy of the original RGB to get better conversion to CMYK.

You might see a super saturated RGB red go to a very dull CMYK red. If you bring that RGB red a little closer to a CMYK red in the RGB mode you can get a much better conversion.

You do need a calibrated system to attempt this sort of thing.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Marnie's right: Photoshop invisibly transforms the RGB file to L*a*b before reconverting it to CMYK, so converting to L*a*b yourself is redundant. The transform is also high-bit (I forget, but at least 16bpp. It might be 18 or 20).

So when you convert RGB->CMYK or do a profile->profile conversion, it goes:

RGB (8 or 16 bit) -> L*a*b (high-bit) -> CMYK (8 or 16 bit).

L*a*b, being a device-independent space, is effectively the middleman for any type of colour transform.

W/r/t to retaining out-of-gamut colours, there are various approaches. First of all there are the four built-in conversion methods (rendering intents):

- Relative colorimetric moves out-of-gamut colours into the new gamut and leaves in-gamut colours alone. It works well for most transforms and is my default setting. RelCol, unlike AbsCol, also remaps the white and black points of the old gamut to the new one.

- Perceptual compresses the entire colour gamut in order to pull in o-o-g colours, so there may be some overall loss of saturation. It works well for photographic-type images with an overall mid-grey colour average (ie lots of different colours). It also remaps white and black points. Try it if RelCol gives a poor result.

- Absolute Colorimetric clips o-o-g colours and represents old colour numbers from the viewpoint of the new gamut. Doesn't remap white/black points. It's used for soft-proofing on screen, for example. Never to be used for straightforward RGB->CMYK conversions.

- Saturation retains saturation information at the expense of hue and luminosity. Good for big areas of pure colour -- ie not photo-type images, but block-colour designs etc.

The bulldozer approach is to switch on Photoshop's gamut warning and work with the Hue/Saturation sliders until you can manually bring all colours within gamut. I've never managed to get great results doing this -- the built-in colour engine is a lot smarter than me :).

One other approach is to change your CMYK working space. There are various different flavours of SWOP and ISO working spaces that have slightly different colour gamuts and better or worse transforms. The Adobe SWOP v2 space is good, but I've always got the best results with the old Kodak SWOP Press profile and build all my custom profiles around that.

The last approach is to convert and then, post-conversion, work with the CMYK file to bring out the best possible balance of saturation and detail. This is what I generally end up doing if I have a problematic image to convert.

In the old days this wasn't a problem because you sent your trannies to a good drum scanner op and he sent you back ready-separated CMYK files. You never even saw the RGB images, so didn't latch on to the wider gamuts available in RGB spaces. These days a good 70% of images sent to me are originated digitally and arrive as RGB (often untagged -- ie, with no information about the colour space they're originated in).

You can read a lot more about this stuff at the Yahoo <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/colortheory/" target="_blank">Colour Theory group</a>. Or Google 'Dan Margulis makeready' for some fascinating colour-oriented articles.

		<div class="commentbody">You seem to confuse a device's gamut with the color-space that device use for calculations. 

RGB and CMYK can both span the same spectrum: the differenent monitor and printer gamut is due to the phosphors and inks used, which span different subsets of the visible spectrum, and thus a conversation is needed. 

L*a*b* is used as a middleman because it's perceptually uniform: that is, linear distances between colors agree with the visual perception of that distance (unlike in the XYZ/RGB color-spaces, e.g.), and thus simplify the math involved in the conversation, since when in L*a*b* we can match near colors using a linear metric.</div>
