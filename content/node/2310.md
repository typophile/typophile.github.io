body: Hello everyone! Itay K introduced me to these forums, and it&#39;s a real pleasure
  seeing such widely active discussions on type. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m uploading a sample
  of a typeface I&#39;ve been working on, it&#39;s a simple Hebrew font, stretched
  to fit three different &#34;x-heights&#34;. The basic letter shape is also my design.

  body: 'My Hebrew is poor, and my eye for it not good enough to really comment, but
    a lot of the &#39;sans&#39; style Hebrew fonts look very clunky to me, not having
    the subtle modeling that the best modern Roman sans do.  <BR> <BR>I was struck
    by the sign in back of the four security chiefs that appeared recently in the
    papers that the font was very well done in this respect. &#40;Yes I read the &#39;we
    are headed for catastrophy&#39; message - I was glad I could think about the font!&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Your font is more graceful than some other Hebrew sans I have seen. My only
    questions would be about your tet and tsadi sofit, which don&#39;t seem quite
    as balanced. But I don&#39;t know enough to comment further. '

  body: Thank you for your responce, William! <BR> <BR>You are right about the Tet,
    I made an alternative version of it, without a slanting line, it has much more
    inner white space. <BR> <BR>About the Tzadi Sofit, I also made an alternative
    shape that has a lower intersection point &#40;positioned on its baseline&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m including an image of the alternative letters compared with the
    originals. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21821.gif"

    say more. <BR>Good luck with it! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I like the alternates; they feel &#39;right&#39; and balanced to me.  <BR>
    <BR>You might consider what they call &#39;trapping&#39; - a widened, deeper &#39;v&#39;
    of white space on some of the narrow angle joins, such as on the narrower versions
    of the tzadi sofit, and on the middle arm of all the widths of shin. This will
    make it not &#39;close up&#39; with ink or on screen when it is small.  <BR> <BR>I
    think the numerals need some work, but I&#39;m not sure how. I know that Arabic
    numberals are handled different in Roman fonts than in Arabic ones. Are they handled
    yet again differently in Hebrew fonts, to harmonize with the Hebrew? <BR> <BR>In
    the big size I can see better what is going on, and I like the way you&#39;ve
    rounded the bottom of the tet, and rounded outside corners. This adds a finesse
    that I have sometimes found missing in Hebrew sans faces, as I said.  '
