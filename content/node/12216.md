  I'd love to get a look at something more substantive.

  body: I would be interested to see this also. It is intriguing, if nothing else,
    because of its air of secrecy. A 1995 interview with Slimbach in Adobe magazine
    mentions he had already begun the Garamond masters at that time. A font family
    ten years in the making ... I'm thinking just looking at its specimen book would
    reveal the secret of who shot JFK or grant eternal life or something spectacular.

    that this is, bar none, the most accomplished typeface you can get for complex
    Greek texts, on a number of levels. It also foregrounds with confidence an approach
    to re-interpretation of historical models that has been bubbling under the surface
    for at least ten years, and is long overdue some prime time. It will be a pleasure

      and I too would be curious about that.\r\n\r\nThe polytonic Greek (a special
      interest of mine, too) looks attractive, though I'd want to see a block of text
      set with it; as I teach Greek, my main criterion for Greek faces depends on
      how well elemnetary learners can apprehend and differentiate the letterforms,
      and that's harder to judge from just looking at the character set."

  body: "[Thanks to Clodosinde for hisher post, which brought this to my attention
    again; topics can fall \"below the fold\" too fast. For the somnolently challenged,
    I commented on the very same thing during my recent www.typeradio.org interview,
    so I'll try not to deviate too much from what I recall saying there. but this
    is one of those issues that on the MATD takes me a few hours with a cart-full
    of supporting visual material to explain sufficiently, so here I will have to
    be excused for shortcuts in my narrative and little in the way of justification.]\r\n\r\nIf
    you want the short version, jump to the eighties bit, where the *** are. \r\n\r\nOk,
    here goes: the development of the Greek script (like the Latin, but with different
    sources) is divergent in the two cases. But although the script precedes the Latin
    it does not have direct links in any of its cases to inscriptional forms. Instead,
    the roots of both Greek cases are in manuscripts of the Alexandrine and early
    Byzantine era, when people were writing on softer materials. The capitals maintained
    -- and, indeed amplified -- the presentational and theatrical elements, being
    used mostly for titling and ecclesiastical documents (read: a conservative context)
    and their echoes survive to this day in specific pockets of scribal and typographical
    documents, as well as hagiography. The lower case has its root in secular documents:
    records, transactions, literary works, and the like: written fast, on cheaper
    materials. The sack of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204 helped a flowering
    of Cretan letters; and the impressively timed second sack by the Ottomans in 1453
    (geddit?) sent a small army of Greek scribes to the Italian peninsula. They hit
    the ground in the middle of the Renaissance interest in all things Classical Greek
    (and especially Aristotle; see below). They took with them the fast, joined secular
    script they used in volume into their new jobs as editors, proofreaders, typesetters,
    printers, and teachers (importantly of the offspring of the well-to-do literati,
    who would grow with this script for their Greek notes). Note that there was, as
    you would expect, a range of styles within the genre of this secular Byzantine
    script. The first printers tried out the different styles, but it was Aldus' choice
    that edged out its competitors -- not on stylistic grounds, since other styles
    were equally well accepted, but primarily due to his typographic choices (cheaper,
    small format books) and editorial policy (good progress towards the works of Aristotle,
    whose were deemed the ultimate texts for scholars to contemplate. \r\n\r\nSo far,
    so good. But throw in professionals that are simultaneously very conservative
    and mindful of what the competition does, and you get exceptional continuity in
    the typographic style. By the end of the eighteenth century we have seen a simplification
    of the forms and the development of a more typographical script, but nothing like
    the top-to-bottom re-jigging of the Latin script. At the end of the nineteenth
    century there are essentially two \"old\" styles, one upright (French) and one
    inclined (German) plus an inclined style less than a century old. \r\n\r\nThen
    mechanical typesetting hits the horizon, and in the early years of the twentieth
    century Monotype single-handedly flips things on their head by fixing for Greek
    the upright=primary, inclined=secondary model, albeit not without exceptions (single-variant
    typefaces continue for many decades). Although there are now local foundries,
    their innovation tends to focus on display styles, and the parameters for text-setting
    are firmly set on the Monotype mould. This situation continues until after WW2
    and the Greek Civil War (1944\u201349). \r\n\r\nFirst signs of new ideas come
    in 1956\u201357 with Times New Roman Greek: this is a very strange beast, whose
    design echoes on one hand the rationalising tendencies of the International Style
    and on the other the primary/secondary style discussions Morison and van Krimpen
    were having. This distorted template set the tone for text typefaces for quite
    some time, breaking ranks with a 500-year history. Fast forward to the early seventies,
    when Linotype introduced a whole new raft of typefaces (most importantly Helvetica
    and Baskerville, but also Souvenir, CentSchoolbook, later Optima) for phototypesetting.
    Mike Parker recounted eloquently one aspect of this chapter during TypeCon, at
    the celebration for Matthew Carter. What he did not comment on was that at the
    time Greece was smack in the middle of a military dictatorship bent on distancing
    the country from the \"Soviet menace\". The sound-bite \"we belong to the West\"
    was often repeated then, and it is within this context that the Linotype typefaces
    were developed: explicitly eschewing \"traditional\" elements, and going for a
    more \"western\" texture. This was a radical stylistic re-appraisal of the Greek
    typographic script, perhaps equivalent to the adoption of the sans serifs for
    running text in the Latin script. Even within this very particular agenda, Linotype
    did a pretty good job of producing these typefaces: they \"just worked\" especially
    for the documents the emerging middle classes would be producing: magazines, advertising,
    ephemera, and so on. Combined with a very long gap in any significant typeface
    development by any manufacturer these Linotype typefaces set the tone for the
    whole of the seventies and eighties. (I recall when I started working in 1986
    that major service bureaux would get by simply with the basic Linotype set, relying
    for variety on the considerable range of compression/expansion of the forms their
    typesetting equipment would afford).  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAll this gives you a
    decent context for the eighties, which is much more complicated as a narrative
    by the switch to monotonic, the gradual change in equipment in small printers
    (small Heidelberg platens giving their place to A4 / A3 offest presses), the DTP
    thing which was essentially driven by new box-shifter companies with no design
    personnel, the implications of the ISO8857-9 encoding (and the related Win1253,
    and the really crappy MacOSGreek) for font piracy, the early nineties explosion
    in small bureaux, the complicated tertiary educational environment in design,
    and a few other things it normally takes me quite some time to go over. Fast forward
    to the mid/late nineties, when Adobe was working on Minion Pro, which -- correctly,
    for its time -- was pitched as a workhorse text family -- what Times should have
    been, in a sense. Shortly after followed Myriad Pro and Warnock Pro (the latter
    a bit more adventurous than Minion in the Greek). These typefaces updated the
    Greek canon and provided some useful tools: a good polytonic, substantial character
    sets, wide families, and unicode encoding. \r\n\r\nSince the mid nineties Greece
    is becoming increasingly more confident of its position and culture, with the
    zenith marked by the entry into the Eurozone (on cooked books, we now know) and
    the Olympics (don't get me started). Less observed, but equally important, was
    the proud welcoming of the Byzantine heritage, signified by the major \"Glory
    of Byzantium\" exhibition in the Metropolitan a few years earlier. In short, the
    not-so-clearly defined Byzantine character, which mixed influences, religions,
    languages, and traditions, was recognised as a full (and in my view the main)
    progenitor of the modern Greek society.\r\n\r\nSo, as Minion was reflective of
    the less confident nineties, needing to re-state the fairly old paradigms, Garamond
    Premiere Pro Super-Long Name Extra revisits the sixteenth century models for the
    Greek, and updates them for the current context, in a very twenty-first century
    interpretation. In many ways it would have been impossible for a major publisher
    to put out a typeface like this much earlier; but the time is ripe now, and similar
    approaches in less visible quarters echo this approach to re-interpreting Greek.
    So, if you want a kick-arse text typeface with all the bells and whistles, give
    it a go. I've used the main weights of the typeface a lot, but cannot show you
    anything because all I've got is beta fonts. \r\n\r\n(I should be writing more
    at this stage, but I got fed up. Please not more questions about Greek.) "
