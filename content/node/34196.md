  body: 'I actually started with scanned penwork. (edit: that looked calligraphic.)
    However, I found the original idea, while it looked nice an inch tall, scaled
    just horribly. The bottoms fade away as the size shrinks, making a drifting baseline.
    But I dont care for the flares as a compensation for that.'

  body: 'What size do you intend as the "design size"? If you intend it to be used
    big, then the flares are less an issue. I can''t see this looking good too small,
    though. '

  body: The flares hold it together at medium small sizes, but I think they look weak,
    detracting from the overall feel.

    it is toe, but it could be confusing.) \r\n\r\nI also wouldn't undershoot too
    much, else the overshooting characters like o and e look too low. (But I do like
    the way the o and the e look!)"

  body: "As I work on it, that issue comes and goes. Once the primary form is settled,
    I will re-tune the mid-ascender swash, again.\r\n\r\nDo the stronger stems read
    better? Neither of these sets of curves portrays the wispiness of the original
    sketches.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I was looking at undershooting the o and e, now
    they appear to drop below the line tho' they are flush with the stems' points.
    I will probably resolve that when developing the a and u."

  body: "Yes, I think the stronger stems read better.  As for the overshoot, now that
    the stems have an apex, they need to overshoot just like a v would. So, I wouldn't
    undershoot the o and e. \r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, what's your g look like?"

    still in the old style. It will not look like the s, in context or isolated. The
    s's descender is still being tweaked.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thistleplantrevisted_5211.png]"

  body: Thank you. It might sound a little too neurotic, but I've fought long and
    hard to make this 's' work. The 'k' is actually feeling like "trying too hard"
    to me. The hardest part is the 'p' and 'z' and other letters where I don't know
    what is too contrived or not anymore. This face is a battlefield...
