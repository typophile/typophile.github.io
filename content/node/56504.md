  \r\nI am currently working on the writing and design of a school assignement about
  OCR font.\r\n \r\nI have a problem with the last stage of my project which is to
  find examples of contemporary graphic design works using this font (OCR A, B or
  FF). My researches turn out unsuccessfull.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if someone
  knows works using this font (OCR A, B or FF). I would be extremelly appreciative
  if you be kind enough to send me informations.\r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n"
