  body: "Thanks for the heads-up, Craig.\r\n\r\n<em>The Origins of Graphic Design
    in America</em> by Ellen Mazur Thomson, 1997, is far and away the best \"cultural
    studies\" history of design I've come across. \r\n\r\nDue credit to Meggs though,
    he established a canon, which enhanced the status of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
