  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's the main weight of Patria, my first &quot;serious&quot; Latin text face. It's part of a larger system which contains &quot;counter-balanced&quot; Armenian fonts (it's a long story - as you might suspect). <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/plat_reg.swf" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/plat_reg.swf">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/plat_reg.swf</a></A> <BR> <BR>You'll need to do a fair amount of zooming, and please pardon the occasional outline infidelity that Flash introduces (like in the inner part of the lc &quot;j&quot;'s tail, the top-right of the numeral &quot;2&quot;, et alia). <BR> <BR>I'm daring to cast Patria as a next-generation newspaper face (or at least a face fit for magazines). Its x-height is somewhat small for this purpose, because I place more value on boumas (word shapes) than most designers. Also, it actually sets narrower than it looks, maybe because the open, generous forms increase its apparent size/width. <BR> <BR>I've tried to give Patria a full-bodied rigidity (read: masculinity) that seems to me to be lacking in the field of text face design. The Carolingian structures are generally very fluid/feminine, which is nice, except I feel there's too much of it now. Blackletter is very masculine, but it's not really usable any more (or at least not right now). The post-modern boys use a lot of rigidity, but they tend to apply it too literally to allow for immersive reading - I've tried to be more subtle. On the other hand, in certain places I've consciously sacrificed readability in order to reinforce the design's character (like in making the lc &quot;s&quot; somewhat wide). <BR> <BR>&mdash;- <BR> <BR>I hadn't looked at Patria for over two months, but now that I'm re-evaluating it, I can see a few things I'd like to change, pending feedback from you guys: <BR> <BR>1. I want to make the beaks that come off of horizontal bars (like in the UC &quot;F&quot;) much larger. <BR> <BR>2. I'm going to rethink the numerals. I'm considering making them Carter-style (&quot;hybrid&quot;) numerals, but the all-horizontal stress I really cherish. Any ideas? <BR> <BR>3. I'm also unhappy with a number of the non-alphabetic glyphs, but I'll wait for you to tell me which ones *you* don't like! And I guess that applies to the *alphabetic* glyphs too&hellip; <BR> <BR>4. I personally prefer the alternate UC &quot;U&quot;, but hesitate to place it as the primary form. <BR> <BR>5. Are the accents too small? <BR> <BR>6. In the Italics: even though I want it to be rigid like the Roman (in fact, I like it to be as close to the Roman as aesthetically and functionally possible), I think I'm going to make the beaks/terminals (like in the lc &quot;s&quot;) softer in contour. <BR> <BR>7. The spacing was a rush job - it needs to be redone. Also, I'm starting to think that it's too loose overall, unless I should account for severe ink bleed - in case my original target medium (newspapers) is reasonable. Lastly, I've yet to add any UC-UC kerning (there are just some manual tweaks right now). For this, I'm considering giving all UC pairs wide spacing, since it helps all-caps setting. Crazy? <BR> <BR>8. I'm considering making midcaps (like in Fenway). If I do, then I might implement that overall loose UC spacing I just mentioned for the midcaps, but not the regular &quot;full&quot; caps. <BR> <BR>9. I will eventually put trapping in the font - the degree of trapping depends very much on the best usage medium for this face. <BR> <BR>&mdash;- <BR> <BR>I have a lot of trouble evaluating my own work (especially something outside Armenian, my specialty), and have to constantly fight myself to find the right compromises, so any insight would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An impressive piece of work that is swimming in subtlety. It is very readable, from what I can tell of the small paragraph.  <BR> <BR>I can tell you what I don't like far easier than what I do, because I like the sum of the parts, but not neccessarily the parts themselves.  <BR> <BR>I don't like the numbers at all. I think you should go back to the drawing board with them. I don't think any newspaper designer would want to use these as they're more designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian. <BR> <BR>The italic is a little too subtly angled. The word &quot;system&quot; hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph. Also, given the overall aesthetic I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic version so similar in lettershape to the regular.  <BR> <BR>I cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font, unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and black versions. The individual letters are not pretty enough, at least not in this regular version, and at least not in my opinion.  <BR> <BR>The &quot;g&quot;: I would have thought that with a vertically stressed font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the lower bowl. Apart from the &quot;s&quot; this is the only letter that doesn't conform vertically.  <BR> <BR>That &quot;U&quot; works fine, like Stephen says. But apart from that one instance I can only say that I like the overall effect, but I can't point to anything specific as I think that for the most part you've successfully designed a font that works for word shapes and high readability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guys, thanks for all the feedback so far. <BR>It's proving even more valuable than I expected. <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR>&gt; the italic is very lovely <BR> <BR>Wow, thanks. I'm surprised to hear that. <BR> <BR>&gt; the overhangs on the 'f' and 'r' distract.  <BR> <BR>In the Italic, right? Well, I think I agree. <BR>Probably the paucity of serifs in the Italic <BR>is causing the beaks to stand out too much. <BR> <BR>&gt; The beaks bigger? A la Eureka?  <BR> <BR>(I assume you mean in the Roman only, <BR> and not the &quot;f&quot; or &quot;r&quot; in any case.) <BR> <BR>Eureka is a great design, and there's stuff in Patria (eg the <BR>serifs) that's pretty similar. Some of my beaks are larger, and <BR>some of them *need* to be larger, but I'll note one significant <BR>difference (which is also the case with Foundry's Form, as well <BR>as FF's new Zine, and Parkinson's Azuza): the beaks are abrupt, <BR>not adnate like mine. Formally, that's the way to do it, since <BR>they then match the structure of the serifs. And I almost went <BR>that way myself, except I realized that it makes the design too <BR>mechanical in a way. I wanted to express more depth in my design, <BR>so I'm going for a different level -or maybe flavor- of harmony, <BR>even though I'll surely get some flack for it. <BR> <BR>I might still change my mind, but some people have actually <BR>appreciated the duality, so I've kept it. But if I do change <BR>my mind, I'd soften the serifs instead of hardening the beaks. <BR> <BR>&gt; Why hesitate on the 'U'? <BR> <BR>Because many people hate it. My main reason for preferring it <BR>is authenticity: I think that's how the Romans would've made it. <BR> <BR>My &quot;d&quot; is in a similar vein, except I found a compromise <BR>between the pure structural form (like Gill used), versus <BR>the established one (which is way too homogenous with some <BR>other characters -most notably the &quot;b&quot;- for my taste). <BR> <BR>Oh, and there's some of my Alphabet Reform in there too&hellip;  :-) <BR> <BR>Martin: <BR>&gt; I don't think any newspaper designer would <BR>&gt; want to use [those numerals] as they're more <BR>&gt; designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian. <BR> <BR>You have a point. <BR> <BR>BTW, the best word I've encountered for <BR>what you're describing is &quot;mannered&quot;. <BR> <BR>&gt; The italic is a little too subtly angled. The word &quot;system&quot; <BR>&gt; hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph. <BR> <BR>&gt; I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic <BR>&gt; version so similar in lettershape to the regular. <BR> <BR>This is a complex issue, and I worry about getting too deeply <BR>into it here. I think I'll start another thread (eventually). <BR> <BR>For the moment, let me quickly state the following (hoping <BR>that it's not too cryptic): when it comes to text fonts, I <BR>think there's a huge difference between what we consiously <BR>see versus what we think we see when immersed. <BR> <BR>&gt; I cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font, <BR>&gt; unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and <BR>&gt; black versions. <BR> <BR>You're right. <BR>The display cuts would have to be much more regular. <BR>Note that my bold is a text bold, not a display bold. <BR>(But as with the italics, a full elaboration of the <BR> argument is certainly needed.) <BR> <BR>It's actually an interesting paradox, the text versus <BR>display conflict. Certainly, a text font can be made to <BR>look less ugly than it can get away with at small sizes, <BR>but I ponder the true limits of that. I have this hunch <BR>that any real -I mean really real- text font has to have <BR>a certain ugliness. If that sounds crazy, just look at <BR>some of Tracy's work. <BR> <BR>But maybe Patria could be less ugly. <BR> <BR>&gt; The &quot;g&quot;: I would have thought that with a vertically stressed <BR>&gt; font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the <BR>&gt; lower bowl. Apart from the &quot;s&quot; this is the only letter that <BR>&gt; doesn't conform vertically. <BR> <BR>Not surpisingly, I've thought long and deep about the &quot;g&quot;. <BR>My conclusions are somewhat unorthodox, but if I don't <BR>follow them I'd be hypocritical. More to come&hellip; <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR>&gt; I think they stand out *too* much, and only because the weight is <BR>&gt; too light. Even it up with the roman and keep the angle as it is. <BR> <BR>Note also that the x-height of the Italic is smaller. <BR> <BR>The weight calibration issue doesn't bother me, because everything is <BR>on an axis. I just need to do some real print runs from Lino output to <BR>decide the exact weight locations. What is increasingly worrying me, <BR>though, is the extremes: they might be too close, especially the Bold. <BR> <BR>Tiffany: <BR>&gt; maybe there is too much 'scotch' in [the numerals]? <BR> <BR>Now that's interesting. Do you mean that they're too <BR>curly or something? Or that they need to sober up?  :-) <BR> <BR>&gt; The '2', '4' and '6' seem the most in need a fewer curves?? <BR> <BR>(What about the &quot;9&quot;?) <BR>I agree on the &quot;2&quot;, but the &quot;4&quot; is my darling. <BR>As for the &quot;6&quot;/&quot;9&quot;, I'm probably going to change them <BR>completely, making them bowl-with-curved-diagonal-stick. <BR> <BR>(BTW, concerning the numerals, I'm sure you can tell that they're coming <BR> from that thread I once started about &quot;Latinized Arabic&quot; numerals.) <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR>&gt; [The 'f' and 'r' hang too much] in the roman as well. <BR> <BR>Remember my penchant for promoting boumas (word shapes). <BR> <BR>The Roman's &quot;f&quot; especially I'm pretty content with. <BR>But its &quot;r&quot; is admittedly more difficult to justify. <BR> <BR>&gt; Not fan of the 'g' either. <BR> <BR>:-( <BR> <BR>&gt; I'd buy. <BR> <BR>Cool. Just send me 500 Euro in advance, wire- <BR>transfer to my Cayman Islands account is fine. <BR> <BR>Ole: <BR>&gt; can you explain the design concepts of the fl and fi ligatures <BR> <BR>Well, Bob, I'm very happy you asked that question!  :-) <BR> <BR>Different fonts need different tactics for the f-ligatures, <BR>but for some reason most designers appear to be to shackled <BR>to some strange standards that were established who know how <BR>long ago and for what peculiar reasons (maybe for showmanship). <BR>My ligatures look like that because to me making a font work <BR>is more important than pleasing the establishment. If my x- <BR>height were smaller, I'd probably merge the &quot;f&quot;'s beak with <BR>the &quot;i&quot;'s dot in the &quot;fi&quot;. On the other hand, the conventional <BR>&quot;fl&quot; ligature in particular usually looks horrid; it's really <BR>a mannered display-font trick, not something text-worthy. <BR>I decided to chop off the el's top serif. <BR> <BR>Martin: <BR>&gt; there seems to me to be not enough difference in the weights. <BR> <BR>This is actually the same deal as with <BR>the Italic issue you were making above. <BR> <BR>&gt; looking at the screen is less than optimal <BR> <BR>It's difficult to over-emphasize that. The lack of <BR>congruence between the screen and the actual printed <BR>end-result is really staggering. Even a 1200 dpi laser <BR>doesn't cut it. <BR> <BR>&gt; it's of primary importance in designing a text family. <BR> <BR>Totally. <BR> <BR>Jacques: <BR>&gt; You are using more flat curves (Lc 's' e.g.) <BR>&gt; and very round ones (Lc 'c' e.g.). <BR> <BR>&gt; I would to try to make the 'flat' <BR>&gt; curves a little bit rounder. <BR> <BR>This opens up another interesting world! Remembering that my <BR>intention is to give Patria a certain rigid masculinity, let <BR>me ask: what's more rigid, a perfect circle, or an ellipse?&hellip; <BR> <BR>I totally agree that making the &quot;s&quot; more curvy would make <BR>things more harmonious, overall. But a very circular form is <BR>perhaps &quot;closer&quot; to a straight form in a more nebulous way. <BR>Also, a curvy &quot;s&quot; would make the font too feminine. Note the <BR>other important glyphs which have some unexpected straight <BR>segments: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;. <BR> <BR>&gt; Lc 'g': I would close his belly, <BR>&gt; or try to find a more subtle ending. <BR> <BR>Like I said above, I'll try to elaborate more <BR>in the future, but for now let me just say this: <BR>1. I believe that the closed-bowl bicameral &quot;g&quot; is a flawed <BR>   structure in terms of the nature of the Latin alphabet. <BR>2. The strong ending reinforces boumas. <BR> <BR>&gt; If this face is to become a face for newspaper, <BR>&gt; I wouldn't experiment too much with structure, <BR>&gt; as you did with Lc 'd'. <BR> <BR>That's a good point. Although I feel my structure <BR>is more readable, it might be going too strongly <BR>against expectations. Gill got away with a much <BR>more unconventional form&hellip; but that was Gill! <BR> <BR>&gt; the eye of the Lc 'e' is too big <BR> <BR>It's too big for optimal readability, true. But that's <BR>one place where I decided to sacrifice a little bit of <BR>readability for character. Some other places: <BR>1. The &quot;a&quot;'s middle bar is too rigid. <BR>2. The &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are all too wide, <BR>   and too big-headed (which are actually <BR>   structurally related things). <BR> <BR>BTW, check out this &quot;e&quot; (on the bottom-right): <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html">http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html</a></A> <BR>It's butt-ugly, but man, does it ever work like a charm! <BR> <BR>Anyway, I should consider making a more tame/readable version <BR>of Patria, but in any case the differences will be very subtle, <BR>at least on the surface. What to call it?&hellip; <BR> <BR>BTW, very much of these critiques here seems to me to be related <BR>to the display versus text issue. When I hesitate about some of <BR>the good points you all make, it's because I'm cautious in my <BR>hazy understanding of the feral wolf that is text face design, <BR>versus the domesticated hound that is display design. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patria Italic <BR> <BR>How exciting it is to see that the teachings of Father Catich are still being studied. Father's &quot;Petrarch Script&quot; was the foundation of his calligraphy courses at Saint Ambrose and it played an important role in the development of his ideas for new type designs: in particular the designs he made at the request of William A. Dwiggins for the Linotype machine. <BR> <BR>Patria Italic shows a slim departure from Petrarch in some details like the low horizontal bar of the e, the hook on the tail of the y, and the very popular Helvetica-style g, but the biggest differences seem to be related to its abandonment of typographic traits like the Aldine p and the descending f and its introduction of details like the terminals of c, f, s. <BR> <BR>In most other respects, Patria Italic has the very features prescribed by Father: mild slope (approximately 5 degrees), &quot;rounded parallelogram&quot; counters in the minuscules, and low contrast. For more information, please consult page 28 of &quot;Reed, Pen, &amp; Brush Alphabets&quot; by Edward M. Catich. Also, Father's 1964 book, &quot;Eric Gill: His Social and Artistic Roots&quot; is an excellent elucidation. It expounds on several of his highly influential theories. As a calligraphy student of one of Father's disciples, I marvel at how topical his teachings about the act of writing are in type design today. <BR> <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Teri White</div>

I've gotta check this stuff out - thank you! In the mean time, let me reveal something: Patria italics is derived *directly* (I mean Fontographer-directly, plus tweaks) from the Roman, mostly because I believe in Morison's sloped-roman ideas (in spirit if not details), his one good original (?&hellip;) idea, as far as I'm concerned. So that's where it's probably different than Catich's ideas (I hope&hellip;). <BR> <BR>Also, you could say that Patria has some Gill in it (like look at Joanna's italic), and that might tie in to Catich too. Patria has an inscriptional/lapidary flavor, so maybe that's another relation. BTW, I didn't realize that Catich had &quot;theorical&quot; leanings - I thought he was essentially a classicist. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Correction/Elaboration: <BR>The development of Patria was so strange that I get confused myself sometimes! The italic was *not* derived from the roman - they're more like sister and brother. The father being a third design code-named Harrier, which is essentially a pretty unorthodox semi-serif sloped roman. It's a stand-alone design, but it spawned both the roman and italic of Patria (in parallel). Now here's where it gets really strange. Harrier was inspired by Nour (Patria's Armenian counterpart) and subsequently became a Latin design subordinate to it*; Nour itself is [in part] based on the first Armenian type (made in Venice in the first quarter of the 16th century), which was the principal style of type until about a hundred years ago, and still gets a lot of use. And this first type itself was based on medieval manuscripts. <BR> <BR>* Patria eventually got a subordinate Armenian design - to balance everything out. But there is no Armenian italic - it is not really needed, thanks to a floating emphasis mark (that can be placed on any vowel). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're right, my wording was messy. What I meant by &quot;classicist&quot; was somebody who says &quot;this is the way it used to be done, so this is the way we should do it&quot;. With &quot;theory&quot; (and please don't waste anybody's time nitpicking about typos in such an informal place) I was indeed pretty hazy, but what I did mean was a process by which tradition is often refuted. This is also related to the eternal battle between theory and practice, between people who paint signs for hardware stores versus those who try to understand -and improve- the underlying structures. <BR> <BR>BTW, not dismiss; dislike, and only on a personal level. Which doesn't mean I don't respect Catich's *work* (just like so many people hated Jan van Krimpen, but admired his designs, and even thoughts). In fact, on my next trip to UCLA I will be checking out a copy of his &quot;Reed&hellip;&quot; book, to see what I can learn from it. <BR> <BR>Now, two questions (for now) to you: <BR>1.

		<div class="commentbody">Partly to clarify the development of Patria, but also hoping to spur others into providing glimpses into their work method, I thought to present a partial elaboration of Patria's development. BTW, it's pretty jet-set, so you might even enjoy it! <BR> <BR>Nour came first, and although it incorporates much of my thoughts on readability, it's based on the first style of Armenian type (which is still used, but is seen by many as being old-fashioned at best - I won't go there here/now). This first Armenian type was in turn was based on medieval Armenian manuscripts - a sample: <BR><A HREF="http://www.armsite.com/miniatures/mnshow.phtml?slide=3" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.armsite.com/miniatures/mnshow.phtml?slide=3">http://www.armsite.com/miniatures/mnshow.phtml?slide=3</a></A> <BR> <BR>Here's one of the six sheets of drawings I made for Nour, while I was in Yerevan (during the summer of 2000): <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/nour_yerevan.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour_yerevan.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour_yerevan.gif</a></A> <BR> <BR>Since I consider &quot;authentic&quot; Armenian writing to have a slant (noting again that Armenian doesn't really need italics), but weighing that against the bulk of current Armenian designs (which are upright), and furthermore minding readability, I decided to give the font a slight slant, specifically 1/16 = ~3.58 degrees. And this is actually where the slant of Harrier and Patria-italic comes from. <BR> <BR>Also, since I had plenty of time and no handy access to a computer, I went ahead and drew the letters as close to their (hopefully) final form as I could. It feels like I did more erasing than drawing, but as you can see I still made some small markings concerning adjustments. But in the end, only one letter (out of 38 x 2 characters) underwent a structural change. <BR> <BR>During ATypI's conference in Leipzig I realized that I simply *had* to make a Latin partner for Nour, and the evening after I went to a bar (called &quot;Letterman&quot;!), and over some Obsolut Mandarin I drew some rough stuff: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif</a></A> <BR>I with I could blame the vodka for the poor quality, but the truth is my freehand-drawing skills suck. <BR> <BR>A couple of days later I drew these at a sushi bar in Frankfurt: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif</a></A> <BR>It was over some Sapporo and a spider roll, so I guess that explains &quot;krab&quot;&hellip; <BR> <BR>The next day in Amsterdam, a few hours before boarding my plane back to LA, I was having some mint tea in a place called Goa, and I made a breakthrough: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif</a></A> <BR>I say breakthrough because I figured out exactly how to apply my beloved &quot;rigidity&quot;, and drew the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (a couple of *very* important characters) to satisfaction. You can also see the original &quot;g&quot;, which I saw as too rigid in the end. That &quot;g&quot; also had a &quot;rationalist&quot; stroke contrast distribution, but I decided to compromise it with what other type designers expected to see.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Back in LA, I started doing the &quot;scannable&quot; drawings, but since I then had much more time-pressure as well as easy access to a computer, I didn't bother to &quot;normalize&quot; the weight, slant, width, or even the proportions - since those can be done with software. I drew the structures, and experimented a bit too (note the &quot;k&quot;). <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/harrier_la.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_la.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_la.gif</a></A> <BR> <BR>After a pretty long, sporadic process, I ended up with the beta version of Harrier (around the spring of 2001): <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif</a></A> <BR> <BR>At this point, I decided to make a somewhat complex &quot;balanced&quot; typeface system which combines Armenian and Latin fonts in different ways to maximize versatility. Among other things, this included the creation of the weight extremes for each of the 5 master designs. Harrier changed a little and became the Latin style subordinate to Nour, and it also spawned Patria and its italic, in parallel. After that, Patria got a subordinate Armenian style - which looks a lot like most of those current Armenian designs I mention above! <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif</a></A> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;patria/dev/patria-italic.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/patria-italic.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/patria-italic.gif</a></A> <BR> <BR>Although different in proportions, &quot;serif-ness&quot;, terminals, and even some characters (like the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;), the two are structurally the same. As for the roman of Patria, it also comes from Harrier, but it required deeper changes, like in the arches of &quot;hmnu&quot;, the armature of the &quot;k&quot;, and other places. <BR> <BR>Patria's atypical provenance makes it admittedly somewhat unorthodox, but I hope I've applied everything with enough subtlety to avoid rejection. <BR> <BR>One last thing: I've decided to make some improvements to Patria, but one thing continues to escape resolution&hellip; Should I reconcile the abrupt serifs with the &quot;adnate&quot; (smooth) beaks (like in the lc &quot;s&quot;), or should I hope that they form a higher order of harmony (but maybe to the point of discord)? And if I reconcile them, should I make the serifs smooth (going towards early 20th century transitional designs, like Times), or should I make the beaks abrupt (like a lot of contemporary work - Eureka comes to mind)? Once I answer this line of questioning (hopefully with your help), I can start thinking about releasing this thing already! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the compliment. <BR>I know some things about type design, but I'm missing more than I know - and always will! <BR> <BR>For many years I was a typographic hermit, but for the past four years I've been discussing type with others and more importantly reading all the &quot;main&quot; books, as well as more &quot;exotic&quot; ones that appeal to me. The value of a good library (especially one with Inter-Library-Loan capability) cannot be overstated. Part of the reason for this is that -even if you're a submissive person, which I'm not- practically nobody will teach you too much these days unless you pay them. And since there's little money in type design now, this doesn't tend to work out&hellip; <BR> <BR>But even more important than reading and learning is *thinking* - on your own. I do that a lot, and it helps to guide my creativity too. One other thing: some people are better at learning through doing, others (like me) through thinking. You have to do both, of course, but it's important to take account of what kind of person you are - especially if you have a mentor (who might be incompatible with your &quot;style&quot;). And if you do have a mentor/teacher, always keep a core of doubt - see him as an equal, although you might have to keep that a secret from him. <BR> <BR>BTW, the Typophile boys *have* made a &quot;compilation&quot; (but just the first 50 fonts, so far): <BR><A HREF="http://typophile.com/gallery/index.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://typophile.com/gallery/index.html">http://typophile.com/gallery/index.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I don't recall the overall characteristics of Patria offhand, so I can't speak to which approach might be more appropriate stylistically.  <BR> <BR>My point is that without a descending tail, you're limited to how long you can make it, which means that it's going to be difficult to differentiate from the 'O', unless you also do something to distinguish it inside the counter. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

If you're spacing tight enough for the odd descender to interrupt, then you've probably got other problems as well. <BR> <BR>But, back to your Q. Okay, if a loop would be too cute, then do something different. My point is to change the shape of the counter. Maybe just take your tail and jab it up and in to the counter. That might be severe enough ;-) <BR> <BR>Your point is taken, though: perhaps this is not so important in a display cut. Still, a little more something seems to be required in your samples. <BR> <BR>If I had to pick one, I'd go with the last example. Since it's almost always going to be followed by a U, can you extend the tail just a little more? (What other languages use Q and what letters follow?)</div>

(1-12, left to right, top to bottom) The corners are subtle, but they help differentiate from the O. I'd still like to see the tail extended slightly beyond the right edge, maybe 15-20 units. I think the bottom concept works, but without seeing the rest of the caps I can't judge how it fits in. Among the four, I prefer number 12.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I thought the descenderless Q was for all-caps titling. <BR> <BR>Well, the descenderlessness (!) of the Display-cut &quot;Q&quot; is to ensure solid lines in case of all-caps setting, but the main usage is *still* mixed-case. I will have an alternate that descends (like the top-left one but a lot shorter), but this is for the main form. <BR> <BR>&gt; I think the bottom concept works <BR> <BR>Note that the &quot;serif&quot; form (on the outside) is the only such form in the font, which might be a problem. But anyway the only good reason I can think of to have a part on the inside is if otherwise it looks too much like an &quot;O&quot;. Since the inside part is a bit disruptive, and the top two rows contain plenty of designs that are sufficiently different than an &quot;O&quot; (especially for a Display cut; and especially the ones with a corner at the bottom-left, like you said), I think I won't go inside. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback! I've narrowed it down to like 4 choices, and I'll have those up soon. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

The shallow slant of the leg is spectacular. <BR> <BR>I'm having a hard time with the tail on the g. It kind of meanders without strength or direction. The concept is not that far off; as a matter of fact, I really like the g from harrier. I would recommend consulting harrier, but also drawing a bunch of quick, strong lineal versions of the character and consulting the curves that come from a bold stroke of the hand.

I thought that because my slant is very slight (1/16 = ~3.58 degrees), and because my serifs are small, I could avoid having to make optical corrections - but I was wrong. <BR> <BR>The structure of the &quot;k&quot; comes from my Alphabet Reform work. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I'm glad you like the italic - thanks! <BR> <BR>&gt; I'm having a hard time with the tail on the g. It kind of meanders without strength or direction. <BR> <BR>Well, I hope that the tail has &quot;inner strength&quot;: note the rigid section in the middle. But quite possibly the join is too soft - maybe something more angular (like in the cedilla?) would be better. One thing I won't do is make the top of the tail horizontal: that has no place in the Latin alphabet - sorry everybody. Also, I don't mind picturing what the/a hand might do in drawing a letter, but I don't actually draw forms by hand - just the outlines - otherwise it's not really type. The forms are in my head - the less things interfere in their eventual physical manifestation, the better. <BR> <BR>&gt; I really like the g from harrier. <BR> <BR>Interesting. <BR>Harrier's is the original, and Patria's was derived from it (mostly) my shortening things vertically.

I think it might be what Bilak is thinking with Fedra - people complain about its unruly postmodern streak too. Part of my belief is that vying for too much control backfires by limiting progress. That said, there's certainly room for improvement at the glyph level. The &quot;w&quot; for example used to be even wider! But maybe it still needs work. The &quot;s&quot; is light during deliberative observation, but its crowded structure means a lighter weight makes it look better for normal/small text - look at the &quot;s&quot; in Lexicon. The &quot;d&quot; I've had doubts about, but if I make it like the &quot;a&quot; that would go against my beliefs about reading. The &quot;g&quot; seems like it's never totally happy&hellip; The &quot;e&quot; might indeed be too big-headed; I thought it balanced with the &quot;a&quot; (both those, as well as &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, are too bulky for optimal readability, but that was actually a conscious design decision, to establish the face's character) but I'll try pulling the eye back a hair. The f-ligs need help, yes; they might have a bit too much ideology in them&hellip; BTW, the separate &quot;f&quot;+&quot;i&quot; don't touch - although Cambria's trick might indeed be an extra help. The abridged serifs on the &quot;m&quot; I'm unsure about: more than any readability issue (in fact the point was to pull it away from similar letters, and reduce clotting) I think it just might be too ugly. <BR> <BR>BTW, note the setting of the title of my article: it's a first jab at making a display cut, where things are much more regularized. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

You need to analyse letters in terms of their primary distinguishers, i.e. those features that make this letter a <i>d</i> and not some other letter, and this is basically true whether one is working with a letter recognition or bouma recognition model of reading (although the treatment of those distinguishers might differ in response to those models). The primary distinguishers of the letter <i>d</i> are the x-height bowl and the ascending stem on the right, these are the features that this letter has that no other letter has, and which are necessary to constitute this letter and to which any other features are secondary, stylistic, etc.. The lower termination of the ascending stem is not a primary distinguisher, so I don't see any reason for it to be different from similar terminations that are also secondary features of other letters such as <i>a</i> and <i>u</i>. <BR> <BR><i>The abridged serifs on the &quot;m&quot; I'm unsure about: more than any readability issue (in fact the point was to pull it away from similar letters, and reduce clotting) I think it just might be too ugly. </i> <BR> <BR>Well, there is that too. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  If you want to further distinguish the m from similar letters, then I think you need to look at things like overall proportions, the arch of the hairlines, etc.. If serifs benefit reading, then truncating these should be the last thing you do.</div>

However, especially deeper in the parafovea where letters break up to come together with other letter parts to form boumas, secondary features still matter.

My experience has been that some type designers hate it, some like it, and laymen don't notice anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">Sergej, you have a point, but I think it's more useful to think of it this way: the more character a font has (and I think it doesn't matter <i>whose</i> character it is) the harder it is to use well broadly, but the more it can shine in certain uses. In making Patria I didn't consciously try to put more or less of <i>myself</i>, but I did want to put &quot;character traits&quot; that I value into it (like sturdiness, via the serif style and those few overly-wide glyphs), and I guess that naturally means there's something of me in it - that's where the &quot;art&quot; in font design comes from, after all. While I think making a font to consiously express one's own character is a bad -or at least selfish- idea, I do think that &quot;unforced&quot; expression is natural and even desirable - you just have to be able to control it sufficiently (if never totally). So sometimes a font is usefully expressive, other times (like in the Baskerville I'm making) one has to be much more careful, more &quot;modest&quot;. So some fonts need to be more neutral than others, depending on how one would like to see them used. Most importantly there's room for both, and -as I think Paul is saying- there's not enough of the &quot;personal&quot; in most contemporary <i>text</i> faces - although there's <i>plenty</i> in the realm of display. And this is probably because text design relies incredibly on subtlety, and this includes the subtletly of (unforced) self-expression - knowing how much to weight it, knowing where/how to place the design in the spectrum of potential usage. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is very hard to decide to add character to a font like adding a spice to a dish.  Character comes about naturally and is inextricably part of the face if it is unconsciously part of the designer. When I first saw Patria in TYPO 13, I was distracted by it&ndash;not in a bad way but in a new-toy way.  Newness brings a certain thump to the senses which mellows with more exposure.  I think Patria works for me more after seeing it a few times.  There are some strange spacing issues with double t, double r, and double f in particular. Perhaps ligs would fix it but I think the right sidebearing of all 3 needs a shaving. <BR>It has a bit of a Benguiat flavor but without the calligraphic feel. <BR>Nice work Hrant&ndash;keep at it. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I'm right, Chris's experience is the desired outcome (at least for a letterform-aware, but open-minded person). Because Patria is &quot;pushy&quot;, not conformant to the conventions of contemporary mainstream type design, it must necessarily feel a bit different (if only as a &quot;tingle&quot; to the layman - which Chris is not). It is gradual familiarity which brings the reader back into the &quot;comfort zone&quot;, with the added -and otherwise unattainable- benefit of functional improvement (slightly better readability). It is my hope that this &quot;familiarity factor&quot; kicks in quickly enough, and sufficiently, for the initial discomfort to be worth suffering; my gambit is that the learning of better boumas isn't wasted. Paradoxically however, this can only be the case if there's more to readability then mere familiarity (and of course there is). I'm pretty confident about the bouma nature of reading, but the true nature and rate of familiarity is what still eludes me, and really everybody else it seems: the chirographers use it to justify the continued insecure clinging to the pen/hand/arm system, while the PoMo hooligans use it to justify whatever they happen to be feeling that afternoon - but nobody really knows. That's the next step, for me at least - and it can change [almost] everything. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>I'll take a close look at the funny spacing you've noticed - thanks! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't like Goudy's stuff either (although from what I know about the man I think I would have liked him as a person). But that's secondary (at most). The important thing is that a large number of <i>users</i> like his fonts, and that creates a responsability in a craftsman (if not an artiste). A lot of people love Helvetica - some of them because they think it's &quot;neutral&quot;, and they admire that. That might be fine for them (maybe), but certainly there's more to life than that. <BR> <BR>&gt; I think the only one learning will be you. <BR> <BR>That's not so bad. I certainly can't force other people to learn from it. But I think you're being a bit too negative. If I know that I for one can learn from the successes/mistakes of others, why wouldn't others be able to as well? All it takes is paying attention. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>In terms of familiarity, the questions are: exactly what are we gaining familiarity with when we &quot;learn&quot; a new font; and how fast does this happen? For example, if it takes 10 exposures of an &quot;o&quot; and 10 of an &quot;s&quot; to become comfortable -beyond a certain threshold of comfort, leading to &quot;full&quot; immersion- with a certain form of a &quot;g&quot;, then all this historical chirographic baggage is 100% pointless, it's purely a restriction; but if it takes tens of thousands of exposures of various kinds of &quot;g&quot;s that share something important (like &quot;proper&quot; ductus) to become truly comfortable with that class of &quot;g&quot;, that means a non-conformant &quot;g&quot; can almost never become sufficiently comfortable. The truth is probably somewhere in between these; I personally think closer to the former. But most of all: we don't know. Anybody who uses familiarity to justify his design ideology and/or strike down that of another is an escapist. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I still remember the huge envelopes you sent me years ago ;)  <BR> <BR>After I compared the printed version of the TYPO magazine (which has your essay set in Patria) with your Flash samples, I realized how *inappropriate* it is to judge type on screen. I recommend everybody ordering the printed copy of TYPO (<a href="http://www.magtypo.cz" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.magtypo.cz">http://www.magtypo.cz</a></a> ) or even better, subscribing to it!  <BR> <BR>Seriously, looking at the printed Patria in TYPO:  <BR> <BR>The italic is far more regular, better spaced and more pleasing to read than the roman.  <BR> <BR>Actually, Patria roman isn't pleasant to read. (To me.) I compare pages 7 and 15 in TYPO, i.e. I compare Patria with Charter, which is used to set Kevin Larson's article just two pages before. I know, it's aiming high since Charter is just damn good and comes from the world's best type designer (IMO).  <BR> <BR>In this comparison, Patria doesn't get away very well. Some letters space in a really awkward manner, and some letters produce truly awkward boumas. Look at the word &quot;little&quot; in &quot;there's little reason to doubt&quot;. The second &quot;t&quot; is surrounded by much more whitespace than the rest, truly jumps out of the line. Similar problem with &quot;c&quot;: &quot;difficult&quot; reads almost like &quot;diffi c ult&quot;. The &quot;f&quot; is also strangely spaced, e.g. &quot;refuses&quot; reads like &quot;ref uses&quot;. The &quot;e&quot; is much narrower than other letters would let presume. The &quot;z&quot; is much wider than I would like it to be. The quotes are strangely spaced in (or &quot;familiarity&quot;), the word space after &quot;or&quot; becomes invisible. The forms of &quot;s&quot; and especially &quot;w&quot; are very strange. I think the &quot;w&quot; will look even stranger in Polish which has many &quot;w&quot;s.  <BR> <BR>But above all: IMO, the roman is just too widely and unevenly spaced. You did a much better job on the italic so you know how to space. Trash the spacing of your roman and do it again. It really doesn't have to be that loose.  <BR> <BR>Finally, I just noticed that ParaType has just released Haverj, a new typeface by Manvel Shmavonyan based on Henrik Mnatsakanyan's lettering. It is obvious that Haverj and Patria draw from the same tradition, and that the Armenian influence cannot be overlooked.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, thanks for the candid review! <BR> <BR>&gt; I realized how *inappropriate* it is to judge type on screen. <BR> <BR>Especially a text font, especially in Flash! <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Patria (both the Roman and Italic) were derived from Harrier* (the Latin that's &quot;formally&quot; subordinate to the Armenian), which I think I spaced very well. The spacing of Patria was a retrofit (just to get it ready for Bukvaraz), and I guess the Italic is closer to Harrier than the Roman is, so maybe that's why it suffered less? I honestly don't know, because they both look &quot;adequately&quot; spaced to me: not extremely good, but better than average. For one thing, they're missing large chunks of kerning. And yeah, comparing it to Charter is either highly unfair or highly flattering.  :-) <BR> <BR>* Which is the font in that stunt you once helped me pull! But I don't remember the envelopes being huge&hellip; At least not in SUV country. <BR> <BR>So I admit, the spacing needs to be redone. And I'll look at your specific complaints before I do that. BTW, another issue is that the four weights of Patria are uniwidth. I used to think I could make this work, but then I realized that the Light would have to become too wide to avoid being too loose, while the Bold the opposite (the Regular and Demi are fine in this respect, I think). <BR> <BR>Also: <BR>&gt; The &quot;e&quot; is much narrower than other letters would let presume. <BR> <BR>I don't understand what you mean here. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; It is obvious that Haverj and Patria draw from <BR>&gt; the same tradition, and that the Armenian <BR>&gt; influence cannot be overlooked.  <BR> <BR>This is an interesting issue. <BR>First one must realize that very few Latin readers will have actually looked at Armenian text, so at most this might result in an &quot;alien&quot; feel, and I agree that's bad in a text face (when it's so consciously noticed). But the correct [small] amount of alien feel simply translates to originality and freshness I think, at least when people don't know to read &quot;Armenian-ness&quot; into it, so that wouldn't put a certain ethnic spin on the atmosphere of the font. <BR> <BR>Clearly, Patria is indeed derived from a classical Armenian style, but the question is, is this influence strong enough to make people uneasy reading it? I personally doubt it. For one thing, when I show it to laymen and ask for opinions, they usually get embarassed because they can't tell what about it is different than Times! As one typography researcher was told when testing Georgia against something-or-other: &quot;This Times is easier to read than that Times&quot;&hellip; <BR> <BR>But when it comes to Haverj, the &quot;j&quot; and &quot;f&quot; especially seem to put it further from the &quot;text epicenter&quot; than Patria, wouldn't you say? In any case though, it's an interesting and useful face*, and it does have some Armenian character, although it's more of the photofont era (and that &quot;K&quot;/&quot;R&quot; stuff is very Russian, or maybe 19th-century French, not at all Armenian). In contrast, Patria's Armenian character is from the Middle Ages, and applied more subtly (I hope). <BR> <BR>* Makes me think of an Armenian Priori (just shier). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have not seen Patria in print, but from the on-line showing I agree with Adam. I do like your Harrier italic, posted on typophile, so I have been puzzled by the awkwardness of Patria. My theory is that you have let your various theories, right and wrong, be the judge, instead of your own eye. In any case, other people's eyes are going to be final arbiter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1) Harrier has much more ideology in it (considering it's meant to be a full-on book face). <BR>2) Patria (Roman and Italic) are <i>mechanically</i> derived from Harrier: made upright, made narrower in the case of the Italic, vertical proportions shifted, serifs added/removed, terminals (and some body parts) tweaked. No structural differences (except the classic &quot;trick&quot; characters in the Italic). <BR> <BR>The reaction to Patria can be characterized thus: <BR>- Some type designers hate it because it doesn't follow their rules. <BR>- Some type designers think it's worth studying. <BR>- Most type designers don't understand where it's coming from (which is understandable). <BR>- Some graphic designers like it enough to pay for a beta. <BR>- Some graphic designers say they're waiting for it to be finished. <BR>- Most graphic designers think it's cool enough to use although they would have preferred some glyphs a bit different. <BR>- Virtually all laymen don't notice anything whatsoever, which means my readability strategy/tactics are free to do their thing. <BR> <BR>You can't please everybody, and I'm certainly incapable of pleasing people who don't like change - everybody likes different things. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant. Now I see Harrier is just a &quot;Label&quot; name for that slanted Latin version in the Patria/Nour system. I think it is way better than the Latin's Italic. <BR>And I found out you already sent me a PDF time ago and looked at it again. <BR>This brought a double question, connected to Segej's observation: <BR>1) In fact, besides the Armenian/Latin system, which is of course very interesting, why should you want to read SO fast? Just to get more crap in your brain from newspaper articles? A book does not need to be read so fast. Inversely, it calls for immersive reading of a meditative quality. <BR>2) Take this as a positive critique: after surpassing the initial &quot;itch&quot; I learned quickly to appreciate and understand your values and concerns. What I still think you should improve is merely the quality of drawn curves: OK for the overall functionality, but many of your glyphs (even the Armenian which I do not know) convey a sense of &quot;unfinished&quot;.</div>
