body: feels good to be back again. hi there :-&#41; <BR>I just finished a logotype
  that, oddly enough, was immediately accepted by the client. due to the tight turnaround
  time &#40;1 week only prior to the lunch of a new computer shop&#41;, it wasn&#39;t
  until now that I could take a step back and ask for some help as far as the result
  is concerned. I guess the work could well take in a great deal of finetuning, but
  I was mainly interested in the overall personality of the logotype. <BR> <BR>thanks
  a lot. <BR>george // cellsius <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28632.gif"

  body: Welcome back George! <BR> <BR>The overly round inside apex of the &#34;M&#34;
    bothers me a little bit, but most of all the &#34;I&#34; seems like it should
    be a really short &#34;L&#34; instead. As it stands the &#34;I&#34;s are fighting
    with the &#34;L&#34;/&#34;N&#34; &#40;which have somewhat too thick lower parts,
    btw&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The curved bottom of the lower stroke on the L and the E, should be mirrored
    by the top of the stroke, not necessarily parallel, an amount of upward movement
    could reduce the heaviness which Hrant comments on, I also feel that the middle
    stroke of the E should move up slightly to compensate for the curve. btw shouldn&#39;t
    that be millennium? <BR>Tim

  body: thanks, Hrant. I feel I should provide further details since there are no
    more takers around ... <BR>MILENIUM is a computer brand going national and they
    want a fresh ID system based on a logotype bold enough to be cast into plastic
    for computer panel usage. Besides this, I was free to come up with whatever I
    felt fit, within such a short period of time. My personal chioce went towards
    an &#34;indesit&#34; uppercase - lowercase lettering, modern and relevant. instead
    of taking the obvious way &#40;E, L uppercased and the rest lowercase&#41; <BR><img

    <BR>they chose to go with this unusual lowercase &#34;i&#34;. <BR>I fear it might
    lack that good obviousness that turns an obscure detail into a clever idea. <BR>

  body: Lower Design a bit trendy looking. Before proceeeding- The questions to ask
    would be where they are at but where they want to be in 5 years, 10 years, etc...,
    the branding they do now should be &#34;current&#34; looking in 5 years&#43;.
    Who is buying they equipment 30 year olds, gamers, execs, what is price point?
    <BR>Assuming it ie all somewhere in the middle I would say the  <BR>top type properly
    be best in say 5 years as well as cool enough for the current young audience..
    The bottom is nice but that trend is on it&#39;s way out in my opinion. Less legible.
    <BR>U, N and M&#39;s look nice. I works. The E needs work. L too.
