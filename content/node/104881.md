  body: Those are the typical type style of a letterpress serial numbering device's
    output, and while someone may have made a font that will match it, I have been
    unable to find it for you, but my comment may give you a better idea of what to
    look for.

  body: "Thanks George for the insight.\r\nThese numbers combine an \"over rounded\"
    geometric letter style -- somewhat similar to Helvetica -- with an open top 4;
    characteristics that are found in some 19th century fonts, but very rarely in
    modern digital fonts.\r\nThe closest I found were the numbers in a font designed
    by Steffen Sauerteig as a machine readable font using 1990s technology: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-typestar/\">Typestar</a>.\r\nDon"
