    but &#40;1885-2005&#41;? <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I like #4 and #6. I think #6 needs
    the same leading as #4. I like the oldstyle figures for the &#34;150&#34; and
    I think you should perhaps take away the capitals for the &#34;perito......2005&#41;&#34;.
    Keep it smallcaps, put make it all lower-case &#40;?&#41; small caps. <BR> <BR>-

  body: Sergio, very nice work. I like the last one before the college logo &#40;lower
    right&#41;. It has a nice balance of elements. I see you have a golden yellow
    color as the accent. How about exploring a colored metalic for the celebration.
    Just a thought

  body: I would go with top left of your original post, with all small caps and remove
    the parentheses from the dates and make the size equal the rest of the type, I
    would also investigate non-aligning numerals &#40;as the 150&#41;, however the
    5 has a very abrupt stop and the 1 needs its serifs. As for line breaks the lefthand
    second image posted - but not the letterspacing - make more sense. I would also
    redraw the crown with more detail and smoother lines, taking into account the
    sizes it might be reproduced as parts of it will not print at small sizes. You
    have a good composition and colours. <BR>Tim

  body: I&#39;m siding with Tim...the upper left. The last two you showed were quite
    nice, but I think you need the full ellipse to accent the &#39;crowness&#39; of
    the mark. <BR> <BR>Also, I don&#39;t get the periods in the dates...is that a
    regional thing?

  body: I assume the mille marks in the dates are some valued anachronism. Otherwise
    dump them. <BR> <BR>It would be nice if you could turn that long phrase into a
    sort of texture, not so explicit. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Sergio work on the spacing in the numbers on the first version, the 0 is floating
    a bit. The crown is better. I like you made the dates regular rather than bold.
    Nice work

  body: I&#39;d still like to see a bit more of an ellipse under the crown to really
    signify that that is what it is. <BR> <BR>The type on that last one is much improved.
    Very nice.

  body: The updated one is an improvement although the top of the 0 looks a bit flat
    on my screen. The image for the modern one is lovely, the blue could do with some
    gradation as well possibly, the text could use some work maybe moving away from
    centred to ranged, taking care it doesn&#39;t swamp the image use a lighter face/smaller
    size for the numerals. Reproduction could be a problem at small sizes.  <BR>Tim

  body: These are both wonderful. The logos are both very successful in their respective
    approaches. <BR> <BR>I agree with Tim, particularly about small reproduction being
    a problem. I also think the order of the text in the bottom logo is better. To
    me, the dates feel better at the bottom. <BR> <BR>Does the client want a more
    modern approach? I prefer the crown.
