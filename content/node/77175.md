body: "I'm gathering preliminary thoughts on what sort of type family to use for training
  materials (a collection of handouts, worksheets and resources for group activities).
  I am hoping to bring together what has previously been produced in MS Word into
  some kind of professionally designed and published workbook.\r\n\r\nThe subject
  matter will vary (there are several courses) but our brand values should be reflected
  throughout: high quality, people-centred, intelligent, clear, cutting-edge, practical.
  The people who will use the workbooks come from all around the world and work in
  international development.\r\n\r\nWe have previously used Myriad, but I'd rather
  like to explore less familiar options...any way to make things a bit more unique.
  Some sections will be presenting research/theory and other sections will be activities/questions
  so the different tones could be reflected with different fonts or styles. I'm thinking
  there could be a readable serif family with different weights, that sort of doesn't
  sparkle too attractively but at the same time feels pleasantly modern. Milo Serif
  just popped into my head but I fear the x-height may be too large."

  body: Oops, not sure how Praxis snuck in there. Not a serif, obviously.

  body: You could also stay sans, but go a little earthier and less geometric than
    Myriad. The American magazine Sunset used to set nearly the entire publication
    in Underware's Auto, to great effect.
