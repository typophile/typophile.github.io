    be a better place for this kind of question.]\r\n\r\nThat's the meter panel. First
    open FL options (Ctrl+F10 on Windows) and confirm that the \u2018Show meter panel
    when Meter tool is activated\u2019 option is checked in the Glyph Window pane.
    Then activate the \u2018Meter Mode\u2019 measuring tool in the Glyph window (Alt+4
    in Windows version), and this info panel will be displayed. It should then remain
    displayed even when you switch to other tools."

    bottom left corner of the glyph window, nestled between the padlock (keyboard
    input) and zoom menu. '
