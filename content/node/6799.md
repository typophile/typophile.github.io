body: I am currently researching a project where we will use data-driven type objects
  and data sets in Illustrator to create a map in a number of different languages.
  We wish to publish the place names in different languages and make this solution
  scalable as we enter new countries. <BR> <BR>This works great with roman languages
  but breaks down with Chinese and other languages where we need to use another font
  to get the job done. From what I can figure out, Illustrator won&#39;t let me change
  the font for my place names on a per data set basis. <BR> <BR>The problem is that
  corporate graphic standards require the use of one particular roman typeface and
  a different simplified Chinese typeface. It seems to me that to make this work we
  would have to create a custom font combining the roman face with the specific characters
  that we require from the Chinese face.  <BR> <BR>To add to the complication the
  roman face is Type 1 and the simplified Chinese is true type. <BR> <BR>Let me preface
  my question by saying I have never used a type creation/editing software tool such
  as Font Lab or Fontographer. <BR> <BR>1. Is this a realistic solution to my problem?
  <BR> <BR>2. What would be the best tool to allow me to attempt this on my Win2000
  PC? <BR> <BR>Thanks so much for considering my request.

  body: If your system supports Unicode, and you make a Unicode font by combining&#42;
    the Roman and Chinese fonts &#40;which can be done with Pyrus software&#41;, then
    you should be able to use that new single font for everything. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    You might need to get permission to modify the fonts. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;d like
    to outsource this, please consider my services - it sounds like an interesting
    project. <BR> <BR>hhp
