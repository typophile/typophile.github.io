  body: I&#39;m afraid not, James. I fear it might be custom designed. <BR>We&#39;re
    not giving up hope yet though.

  body: I&#39;m with Yves. It looks to me like they started with Helvetica Bold Oblique
    or Italic, built a new y out of a u, custom-designed the tails, and finally sat
    something heavy on it to squish it down.  <BR> <BR>I was surprised to see how
    few faces feature this kind of y, at least in my search. Sorry, James.
