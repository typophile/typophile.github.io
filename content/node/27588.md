body: "I know this topic has come up before, but I think my question is a little different.\r\n\r\nRobert
  Bringhurst says the default Th ligature in many Adobe OpenType fonts is \"misclassified
  as basic\". In order to get InDesign to apply all basic ligatures but not Th, one
  has to either edit every single Adobe OpenType font using a tool such as FontLab
  or use some sort of script to \"undo\" all Th ligatures but not the other basic
  ones.\r\n\r\nI can write a little script, of course, but maybe somebody already
  has one, or can offer another simple solution to the problem (besides <em>find/change</em>)?"

    designer and member of the Adobe font development team, where do you stand on
    the default (rather than discretionary) Th ligature?"

    that ligature doesn't bother me, so I'm fine with the type designer's decision
    of wanting it as default."

    the Th ligature has bothered me is in display settings. For text settings it works,
    unlike a lot of ct and st ligatures."

  body: "<code>Make a custom version of the font(s), using FontLab.</code>\r\n\r\nThat
    would be ideal, and I have edited some of my own fonts (the ones I use most).
    However, if you take the complete Minion Pro, Myriad Pro and Cronos Pro families,
    right there you have almost 150 files to edit. A few more Adobe Pro families (if
    you do work for a firm that has Portfolio 10) and you've become a full-time font
    patcher. And that's if the firm has FontLab.\r\n\r\nOf course you can patch only
    the fonts you need to use (if that's a possibility), but I was hoping to find
    a simpler, less time-consuming solution. I think the bottom line is that such
    a solution doesn't exist."

    believe you can dump the GSUB table, edit it, and replace the original table,
    without crack opening the font. But I can't think of a tool that you can use.
    Perhaps [[TTX]]."

  body: I'd like to thank everyone for your time. Nick, reading my previous post again,
    I realize it may have seemed as if I was dismissing your suggestion, which wasn't
    my intention. For now I'll go on using find/change in InDesign.

  body: "Erik, no worries. \r\nI did actually run through the process I suggested,
    and it took me less than a minute to make the modified font (renamed \"Munion\"),
    install it, and check it in InDesign."

    InDesign, I find it easier to just do a find/change and set the character style
    of all Th pairs to not allow ligatures."
