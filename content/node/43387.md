body: "hello everyone,\r\nI read you for few times, i learned lot of interesting things
  here and this is my first post.\r\n\r\nI'am looking for some infos about unicase
  typography and at the beginning with the bauhaus and new typography concept of the
  lowercase use.\r\nI learn that this bauhaus ideas comes from a book nammed \"sprache
  und schrift\" from 1920 by dr walter Porstmann, the guy who created the standard
  A4, A5 ... format of paper in the DIN organization.\r\nI would know if a translation
  of this book is avaiable. \r\nIf you have any information or texts about this concept,
  would you post it to me? \r\n\r\nI am also interested in unicase experimentation
  and looking for info on this subject and also on the alphabet 26 concept by bradbury
  thompson. \r\nThe main problem for me is that the bradbury thompson book \"The art
  of graphic design\" is sold out and that the few used avaiable are too expensive
  for me. If you have this book, could you say me if bradbury thompson speak or not
  about his alphabet 26 concept in this book. If so, could you please send me scans
  images from the selected parts of this books.\r\n\r\nI will write a thesis about
  unicase typography and typographic (utopian or restrictive) experimentations; so
  all links, infos, texts, images are welcome.\r\n\r\nSorry for my english, i am a
  french graphic design student. If i'm not clear, ask me more explanaition.\r\nI
  hope for answers\r\nthanks"
