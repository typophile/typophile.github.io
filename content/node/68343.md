body: "Hi, I am working on a project where the style and theme is to late 1800s, early
  1900s (hunting genre). We have chosen to use \"Cochin\" for titles... but found
  just out that there is no kerning settings. And that there is some problems with
  some ligatures like \"fj\" which is used quite a lot here in Norway. As an alternate
  we have found \"Engravers' Oldstyle 205\", which looks almost identical, but we
  don't know anything about the kerning. Anyone got another alternate tips or can
  confirm if there is any Cochin or Engravers' Oldstyle 205-variations that has ligatures
  and good kerning?\r\n\r\nAny help is deeply appreciated!"

    with OS X 10.3 Panther) has indeed zero kerning pairs.\r\nCochin v6.0d3e1 (shipped
    with OS X 10.5 Leopard), however, has 1,386 kerning pairs (in the Regular). It
    also has 192 newly added glyphs, incl. Cyrillics. And the ligatures (fi/fl) can
    now be automatically substituted.\r\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s still no kerning
    (nor ligature) for \u2018fj\u2019. Have you tried contacting the manufacturer,
    in this case, Linotype?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cochin_6187.png]\r\n\r\nF"

    with OS X Leopard. Will check my cds right now. What is the best way to add my
    own ligature? What software should I use to modify the original Cochin font? And
    is it possible?\r\n\r\nOnce again.. thank you so much!"

    Europe and Cyrillic, but still no Greek :-() Seems to be the same as Florian's
    v6.0d3e1, on a cursory glance.\r\n\r\nIt's supplied as TTC, and the favourite
    editor of this forum -- FontLab -- cannot handle these. FontForge can, and since
    it's free you might as well give it a go. At least, if the EULA allows it."
