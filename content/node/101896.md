  the OS typefaces and the ones that come with Adobe CS, are there other collections
  which are deemed \"must haves\" (either free or that can be purchased as a collection)?\r\n\r\n-
  I'm interested in learning the art of actually creating typefaces. What are considered
  the best learning material (books/online) and tools (Fontlab?)?\r\n\r\nThanks,"

    they are bought one font or family at a time \u2013 but you could start here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30047\r\n\r\nThere
    are no such things as must have fonts though, it all depends on what you do with
    them, what you like, and what\u2019s your budget. You could do searches on Typophile
    for threads on what people consider the best or essential typefaces. What you
    will see though is that these lists are different from person to person."

  body: "If you are a student, there are some additional options available to you
    for inexpensive font collections.\r\n\r\nRegarding books, currently I suggest
    the following as the optimal $100 type designer\u2019s starting library:\r\n\r\nFontographer:
    Type by Design by Stephen Moyes (out of print, used)\r\nThe Stroke by Gerrit Noordzij\r\nThe
    Elements of Typographic Style (4th edition) by Robert Bringhurst\r\nDesigning
    Type by Karen Cheng\r\nAnatomy of a Typeface by Alexander Lawson\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI
    would have Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy on the list, but it is not only out
    of print, but horribly expensive.\r\n\r\nThe Fontographer book may seem very software-specific,
    but it is actually a great general intro to how to work with bezier curves and
    the like.\r\n\r\nKaren Cheng\u2019s book is a bit polarizing for some folks, but
    most of us seem to think it is useful. Yes, you can do most of the same analysis
    on your own with a decent library of fonts and a font editing program, but it
    would take a bunch of work; somebody else doing that for you is helpful, IMO.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    other books may come into play depending on what font editing tool you use. The
    software manual itself may be of use...."
