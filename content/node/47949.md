  body: "It looks like it's somewhere between heavy and black, but it's been changed
    so much that you wouldn't know if there was a stroke around the whole thing. I'm
    not aware of any other typeface that looks like this so I'm almost certain this
    is actually Serif Gothic we're looking at. It has also been know to be a frequent
    target for 'type customisers' like you have in your pic. Other examples are Non-Format,
    who have used it a lot in their work : http://www.non-format.com/archive/channel-4/\r\nAs
    well as Serial Cut : http://www.serialcut.com/"
