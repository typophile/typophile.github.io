  body: "it's a reference point. it comes in handy when you're using the transformations
    panel, you can set this point where you want and then perform transformations
    that key off of this point.\r\n\r\nfor example, to draw a 5-lobed asterisk: draw
    one lobe, place the reference point toward the bottom of the lobe, copy the lobe
    and rotate 72 degrees, setting the center as the reference point, repeat until
    you have all 5 lobes..."

    if that's not what it is, i have no idea what it could be...

  body: "The whole story behind the typeface:\r\n\r\nA client asked me to make a typeface
    using the proportions of a typeface done by someone else. It was a truetype 2048
    UPM typeface (with very bad outlines). I scalled it to 1000 UPM, and stated working
    in the font, which is not smart, I know. When I generate the font it works fine
    but I like to remove the line and the \u2018strange thing\u2019.\r\nThe line and
    \u2018thing\u2019 are in the metrics layer. I can move the line, but can\u2019t
    remove it. Very strange\u2026\r\nOf course I can copy the outlines to a new font,
    but still I like to know what the \u2018thing\u2019 is! :)\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: "If your vfb data have the things in every glyph, I don't know the way to
    remove them at once, but try this method.\r\n\r\n1)Duplicate your vfb data (make
    A and B).\r\n2)Open the \"A\" vfb data and generate metrics data.\r\n3)Open the
    \"B\" vfb data and delete all glyphs. Select all glyph and do command Glyph>Create
    glyph If empty, then import outlines using command Mask>Assign Font Mask from
    the \"A\" vfb.\r\nSwap outline with Mask.\r\n4)Import the metrics data of the
    \"A\" vfb into the \"B\" vfb.\r\n\r\nI think it is a better and easy way than
    the way that you remove the \"thing\" in all glyph individually."

    OpenType & TrueType>OpenType PS(.otf)\r\nCheck off(inactive) Decompose all components\r\n\r\n2)Generate
    OTF(PS). (I could remove all \"things\" at this moment.)\r\n\r\n3)Open OTF font
    that you generated.\r\nAnd then you can copy and paste some glyphs that include
    a component into the original or import some data that you need such as metrics
    and class into this vfb.\r\n\r\nIn case your vfb have any MultipleMaster axis,
    once you copy and paste the glyph that include a component into the original,
    you can keep the component in every glyph.\r\nMemo: You need to copy and paste
    not in the Glyph window but in the Font window.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a simple
    way than the previous one.\r\nBut there might be any other problems.\r\n\r\nBest

    it didn't work every time. So I have to input the vertical glyph metrics values
