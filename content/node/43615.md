  \r\n\r\nI'll post samples later today. It's another face like Spiral & Bremmer's:
  metal & contextual.\r\n\r\nI have some additional cool stuff too that relates to
  Subiaco too c.15th century... more info when I have checked my facts a bit more."

    Schwenheym and Arnold Pannartz used in the books they printed at Subiaco in Italy
    in 1465. It was cut by Edward Prince. </cite> \r\n\r\nEdward would have cut it
    around 1902 or therabouts I think. My sample image ( i will post it soon) was
    printed in 1909.\r\n\r\nThanks Paul!"

    Type and later on worked on a roman for Count Harry Kessler's Cranach-Presse.
    The Subiaco type seems to have been used in the Ashendene Press edition of Dante\u2019s
    <cite>Inferno</cite> in 1902."

    is a sample. This is from a photo repro-specimen, not an original. So it is quite
    a soft image. Note the variety of \"a\" shapes maybe a total of 4. There are two
    \"t\" shapes as well. I am not sure I have found all the contextual variations
    yet.\r\n\r\nThe type that inspired this font is in fact from the 15th century
    - printed at Subiaco in Italy in 1465.\r\n\r\nI am looking for good images of
    those original types now as well as better images of the Ashendene type called
    Subaico.  This type is a transition from blackletter to roman. Conrad Schwenheym
    and Arnold Pannartz moved from Germany to Italy.\r\n\r\n\"Originally from near
    Mainz, Germany, Sweynheym with Arnold Pannartz established (c.1464) in the monastery
    of Subiaco the first known printing press in Italy. Sweynheym and Pannartz first
    used Greek type there in 1465. They moved to Rome in 1467.\"\r\n\r\nSome people
    think that that \"Sweinheim/Sweynheym worked at Eltville with Gutenberg in 1461-64.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    look! Tiff wrote about it too\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/34038\r\n"

  body: "A bit more background from Leeds:\r\n\r\n\"In 1901 Emery Walker and Sydney
    Cockerell designed the famous \u2018Subiaco\u2019 fount for the Press, which was
    based on the Sweynheym-Pannartz typeface that Morris had once used as a model
    for a typeface he never finished. The fount was eagerly received by Hornby, who
    had been greatly influenced by Morris\u2019s principles of good printing through
    an inspiring afternoon spent at the Kelmscott Press in 1895.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/side_private.htm\r\n"

  body: "Eben, I'm pretty sure the ra and ta combinations in the Ashendene Subiaco
    are ligatures, but that's just a practical method for implementing the shape variation
    relationship in the metal type; if Prince were working with OpenType, he might
    well choose to take the contextual alternates approach.\r\n\r\nRoss was very interested
    in both the original Sweynheym and Pannartz faces and the Ashendene version. I'll
    draw his attention to this thread."

  body: "<cite> I\u2019m pretty sure the ra and ta combinations in the Ashendene Subiaco

    this time period. It a book printed in 1469, by Johann ( and maybe Wendelin too
    \ - I am not 100% sure about that ) of Speyer (de Spira). It's not something I
    am sure about like this but I am reasonably confident. I will make separate thread
    for that.\r\n\r\nThere is also is slight possibility that there is a Jenson -
    which would be pretty wild I think. I am not holding my breath on that one but
    he was working at the same time and I seem to recall his sort of taking over the
    de Spira business or something. Anyway - there was I think a real relationship
    of some kind. That one has a thread already.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43627\r\n\r\nI
    would appreciate any help you guys can muster in finding better images for these
    3 examples!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    image BTW is from the book &quot;The Ashendene Press&quot; by Colin Franklin (1986).
    It's is a marvelous book in many many ways including it's cover binding etc. But
    my favorite aspect is the notes passed back & forth between Hornby & Prince during
    the development of the Ashendene revival."
