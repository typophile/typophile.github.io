  if anyone could tell me the minimal legible size for printed\r\nserif fonts and
  sansserif fonts. i know that it really depends on the typeface,  \r\nand it is extremely
  relative, but i need to put copyright (all rights reserved ......) \r\ninfo on a
  CD design (onto the actual CD - using AG Book Rounded, either Regular or Medium)
  and want \r\nit to be tiny but still legible..... is 2 points too small? maybe 3
  points?\r\n\r\nthx!!"

  body: i would say both are too small, especially given your typeface choice. i'd
    say minimum is 4 or even 5 pts.

  body: "The smallest I've ever printed on a cd face has been 6 pt Franklin Gothic.
    I think the limit is probably around 5 pt, I would be really nervous about going
    any smaller than that. From my experience, this is small enough if you put the
    copyright information around the outside rim.\r\nA serif font would need to be
    printed a little bigger because the thins tend to fill in. If you're knocking
    the text out it also needs to be bigger because of the ink spread. "

  body: "Minuscule. It's still legible in 3pt size due to the designer's awareness
    on inkspread and legibility issues. I've seen printed samples, i.e. Thomas Huot-Marchand
    has put together all 30-something pages of \"Physiologie de la lecture et de l'ecriture\"
    by Emile Javal on one DIN A4 sheet. \r\nMinuscule is still being fine tuned afaik.
    It will be available \"at the end of summer\" at <a href=\"http://www.256tm.com/\">http://www.256tm.com/</a>\r\nA
    sample of the 2pt \"Minuscule deux\" (or was that the 3pt? correct me if I am
    wrong) can be found <a href=\"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_b.gif\">here</a>."

  body: "I have a cd on my desk that has 5pt Helvetica Roman reversed out of black
    which is just readable but it is not very reader-friendly and my copy of Illustrator
    9 has what looks like 4pt in a condensed sans which is surprisingly good. I suppose
    the primary questions are how many colours you are printing, what print process
    you are using and what surface the cd has in the first place.\r\nTim"

    which in my past experience means relatively low resolution and lots of choking
    and bleeding. I would suggest \r\nconverting the final type to paths and make
    mods to compensate, ie. ink traps and opening the counters a bit.  "

  body: I'm sorry but you have a legal problem. If you set the copyright information
    below a certain point size then its considered deception and illeagal. Consult
    your companies attorney.

    end user. Yes there are leagal minumum point sizes. I'm sure you can understand
    this as an issue.

  body: "> there are leagal minumum point sizes.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying there aren't.
    But they can only mean something if \"point size\" is defined. Is the \"point
    size\" that number you choose in an application? Because you must understand that
    that has no real bearing on the actual size of the text that comes out... That's
    the problem I was alluding to.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
