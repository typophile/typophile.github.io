  body: "Argh!!! Dav, watch out! You used a trademarked name owned by <em>The Company
    With The Very Rich Lawyers Which Won't Be Named</em> in your post, most probably
    without acquiring the proper permission nor paying any royalties! (gasp!)\r\n\r\nYour
    arse is grass, dude. You can look forward to receiving a juicy <em>Cease and Desist</em>
    letter and facing the inevitable ensuing bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIt was fun knowing
    you and having you on the Type ID Board. I'll miss you ... :'^("
