body: "Can anybody shed any information on how to repair my fonts folder / strip it
  down to just the default fonts in Windows (XP)? I have been using Linotypes Font
  Explorer BETA and after a couple of installs / reinstalls/ uninstalls I seem to
  have corrupted things. A few of my fonts in the MS programs are not displaying correctly/wonrg
  fonts being used.\r\n\r\nAny ideas how to just revert to the defualt Windows fonts?
  Currently when looking at my fonts folder it just appears full of shortcuts rather
  than fonts. I don't think this is due to Suitcase which I am now using.\r\n\r\nAlso
  - on a side note - anyone know if Font Explorer will EVER see the light of day in
  a non beta version? I love it on the Mac but would love to have it workin properly
  on my PC at work as Suitcase kinda sucks....\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    have a list of the fonts supplied with the OS so I guess you could Find Files
    & Folders for these on your system to see if the program moved them, then move
    'em back to the Windows/Fonts/ directory manually. [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/winxp.htm]]\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I use [[http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html|High-Logic's MainType 2.1]] which
    works very well for $49. No install needed either so I can keep it on a flash
    drive."

    extract individual files from the XP install disc.\r\n\r\nIf you go down the route
    of a Windows refresh/install, can I suggest (from experience) that you make ('slipstream')
    a new disc with service packs, updates and machine specific drivers included -
    saves a lot of time and effort."

    another fontz folder.\r\n\r\nAccessing the fonts folder through the command prompt
    \r\nmight help solve the problem.\r\nJust give it a try with Flowers."

    usually works on Windows, btw.\r\n\r\nI share your frustration with the state
    of font management on Windows. Fwiw, several font management vendors are working
    on improved Windows products. The next year should be good in this regard.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
