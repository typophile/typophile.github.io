  body: Please keep in mind that this logo was most probably custom designed. The
    fact that the letter shapes are so simple makes this even more likely.

  body: Thanks tearsforsappho! That's almost the typeface, although I think there
    was just a condensed version of Venacti in use, or as you supposed just simply
    scaled. I think the combination with the FF Din (i think it is the Din) doesn't
    look bad. Below you can see the whole composition of the logo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burn3_4472.jpg]

    definitely, good call -- didn't want to sound as if I disapproved you giving close
    alternatives. ;^)"
