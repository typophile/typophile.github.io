  Forever'?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/5254/helveticaforeverbook.html\r\n\r\nHow
  does it compare to 'Helvetica: Homage to a typeface'?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: I love Homage, so i'll probably love this one too. I just didn't know if it
    was much different, i get the impression this one has a lot more text and it more
    about the history than just it's use.

  body: "Note: This book is not from Linotype, but rather about Linotype's typeface
    Helvetica.\r\n\r\nThe book was produced by an external publisher, and Linotype
    is sellling the book on its website. I'm sure that the publisher will find lots
    of other venues to sell the book, too. But as you can see, Linotype.com is taking
    orders now. So why wait for March?\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the book yet, since I've
    been out of Linotype's offices for a few months already. But I have a feeling
    that this is quite different to <em>Homage to a typeface</em>. I can't wait to
    see it!"

  body: "From what I've heard, this book is largely about the development of Helvetica,
    with lots of the original material from Haas, and the involvement of Alfred Hoffmann.
    In the movie, we showed a little bit of footage of material from Hoffmann's archive.
    And with M\xFCller publishing it, I'm sure it'll be well-designed. \r\n\r\nI'm
    totally sick of Helvetica, but I'm looking forward to this book!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary "

    \xBBHelvetica forever\xAB mentioned above is german only and, as earlier stated
    right, mainly on the history of the typeface, the time and taste of its development,
    predecessors, clones and influeces; with a lot of original material such as Hoffmann's
    notebook of that time with early smoke-proof f.e.\r\nAn english edition is/will
    be published late spring/early summer 2009.\r\n\r\nIndra Kupferschmid"
