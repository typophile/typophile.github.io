body: I really like Raleway, but the numbers are terrible. I need even numbers, not
  numbers that bounce up and down. I use a lot of model numbers on my forum such as
  6589 or 7500. And it makes the eyes go buggy. Is there any font you can recommend
  that looks like Raleway but displays numbers evenly?

  body: Raleway has a full set of lining numbers (that is, numbers that line up) as
    well as the ranging numbers (that is, numbers that are designed to fit with running
    text and thus "bounce up and down", also known as oldstyle numerals). If you're
    mainly using it on the web, you should be able to specify that you want lining
    figures using the font-feature-settings attribute in your CSS, specifying that
    you want "lnum" as one of them.

      like. I've googled it, but 'lnum css' turns up almost nothing.

  body: Strange, the latter looks fine to me. (I'm totally not an expert though.)
    How are your webfonts served? Some of the services will tend to strip out stuff
    like several sets of numerals for the sake of economy.

    lnum in the .otf. Or maybe it's not required to be in the .otf to use lnum?

  body: "Hi Damian, \r\nWebfonts served by Google Fonts and most other webfonts services
    are usually sub-setted (that means its optimized, and some glyphs are removed
    to make the file smaller so it loads faster).\r\n\r\nTo force Google to send you
    the entire full file (no subsetting) you have to specify \"subsetting=all\".\r\nHere
    is an example on how to do that for the lobster font: http://www.impallari.com/lobster#subsetting\r\nYou
    can do the same for Raleway or any other font.\r\n\r\nOnce you are getting the
    full font, in your CSS you need to add this code to activate the lnum feature
    in all browsers:\r\nfont-feature-settings: \"lnum\"\r\n-moz-font-feature-settings:
    \"lnum\"\r\n-webkit-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"\r\n-ms-font-feature-settings:
    \"lnum\"\r\n-o-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"\r\n\r\nBy the way, the latest Raleway
    release (v3) a few days ago, also include Italics and Cyrillics. Is available
    here: http://www.impallari.com/projects/update/100 and will also be available
    in Google Fonts pretty soon."

  body: "Yep, is strange. But web-developers are very strict about optimization. They
    optimize everything: css, javascript, etc... even small 1kb gifs icons making
    sprites files to save http requests. They want the fonts to be compressed in the
    same way, even if that means removing some glyphs and OT features.\r\n\r\nCurrently
    in Google Fonts there are more subsetting options:\r\n- Latin,\r\n- Latin Extended,\r\n-
    Cyrillic, \r\n- Cyrillic Extended, \r\n- Greek, \r\n- Greek Extended, \r\n- Khmer,
    \r\n- Vietnamese, \r\n- All (disable subsetting and get the full font).\r\n- Your
    can also roll your own custom subsets, using the \"text=xxxx\" parameter.\r\n\r\nBut
    they are mostly intended for language support, and not yet for OT features.\r\nAs
    you might know, not all OT features are currently supported by all browsers, but
    hopefully in the near future they will, and I also hope for the subsetting options
    to improve in all the webfonts services.\r\n\r\nTypeKit only offers 2 options:\r\n-
    Default (Latin)\r\n- All Characters (subsetting off)\r\n\r\nH&JF has done a great
    job in their service, in particular about the subsetting options. They have an
    \"easy to use\" and \"easy to understand\" interface for selecting which glyphs
    gets included and which ones gets removed, allowing the user to fine-tune the
    subsetting optimizations.\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/cloud/feature-tour/images/ft_characters_1x.png\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what are the subsetting options that the other services offer to their
    users. But still, all this webfonts thing is still in an early phase, and there
    is much to improve when looking at the future.\r\n\r\n"

    style-link 400 to 700 and not the other weights.\r\nAlso, it seems like a Microsoft's

    not break our fonts to support defective apps."

    the whole deal - template studio I have subscription with, started using it almost
    everywhere (most new templates), but I need to have Cyrillic in it - google fonts
    still doesn't have it in Cyrillic, and I don't know how to set the template up
    in such a way that it would use any other fonts provider. Could anybody help me
    please? I am quite new to this thing, but can learn quite fast... Thanks in advance.
