body: "How to check the smallcaps kerning in Fontlab metrics window? I have long strings
  of text i have checked the upper- and lowercase with, but is there a feature that
  can turn on the smallcaps feature in the metrics window (I have the opentype smcp
  feature set up) or do you know a way i can convert this text:\r\n\r\nAaAbAcAdAeAfAgAhAiAjAkAlAmAnAoApAqArAsAtAuAvAwAxyAzAAA\r\nBaBbBcBdBeBfBgBhBiBjBkBlBmBnBoBpBqBrBsBtBuBvBwBxyBzBBB
  ...etc\r\n\r\ninto something like this:\r\n\r\n/A /a.smcp /A /b.smcp /A /c.smcp
  /A ...etc\r\n\r\nSo that i can paste it to the metrics window from a text file.
  Handtyping this list isn't probably the most handy way to go here. Any ideas please?"

    it\u2019s called, but it\u2019s the first window you see when you open a font
    \u2014 an overview of all the glyphs) and click \u201CNew metrics window\u201D.
    Use command to select more than one, or shift to select glyphs in a row."

  body: "As far as converting the text goes..\r\n\r\nWhy not manually type one placeholder-string*
    and put it in a text program:\r\n\r\n/? /a.smcp /? /b.smcp /? /c.smcp /? /d.smcp
    /? /e.smcp /? /f.smcp /? /g.smcp /? /h.smcp /? /i.smcp /? /j.smcp /? /k.smcp /?

    to clipboard (command+c).\r\nSearch and replace ? by A.\r\nPaste string again
    (command+v).\r\nSearch and replace ? by B.\r\net cetera\r\n\r\nTakes just a few

    A with .smcp /? / and then manually editing the beginning and end once.\r\n"

    string something like the Leslie Cabarga's Kern King?

  body: "Just another advice: When making kerning of capitals/small letter and small
    caps/small letters \r\nI find better to set the kerning using words. If I used
    only pairs I tend to kern too close and later on text look too tight.\r\n\r\nAs
    example:\r\n\r\nCapital/Small letter\r\nAaron Abbey Accenture , etc\r\n\r\nSmall
    Caps/Small letter\r\nA/a.sc /r.sc/o.sc/n.sc  A/b.sc/b.sc/e.sc/y.sc  A/c.sc/c.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc

  body: "At least use control characters after your test character as in:\r\n\r\n/A/V.sc/H.sc/N.sc
    \ The V.sc is the test glyph being kerned with the A; The H and N give you a feeling
    of the normal rhythm of the smallcap glyphs"

  body: Yes, i would prefer setting the kerning using a real text or words. The trouble
    is in getting the text as smallcaps in to the metrics window. How do you do it?

  body: "The way I'd approach this is to have the string \r\n<code>/H.sc/H.sc/O.sc/O.sc/H.sc/H.sc
    @/H.sc/H.sc/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/N.sc</code>\r\nor\r\n<code>/A.sc @/B.sc @/C.sc @/D.sc
    @/E.sc...</code>\r\nin the preview window. The @ will dynamically update to the
    letter you're working on. When you spot one that needs adjustment you can type
    the pair into the metrics window manually and kern.\r\n\r\n>what if i wanted to
    test a text string something like the Leslie Cabarga's Kern King?\r\nI think you'd
    have to search and replace all glyphs with their small cap equivalents in a text
    editor. Long work, especially if you don't want the initial letters to be switched,
    but you'd only have to do it once to be able to use it again and again."

  body: Assuming you already have your .smcp feature in place, I guess you could also
    just put your original text string into the OpenType preview window, activate
    the ".smcp" feature, and copy the resulting output string (and paste it to the
    metrics/kerning window).
