  integrated Blackletter/Medieval/Gothic sensibilities into a fairly clear script
  font like \"English Script.\"\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMatt "

  body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nGreat suggestions all 'round. Very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI've
    looked through them all and have begun a hybridized approach to a sort of 'regularized'
    Voluta Script and a thinned out David Aubert as a means to reconcile them. This
    'new' thing I'm plugging into a similar but less swashy version altaira's \"jagged
    moss\" configuration. Just hand-sketched so far, but it's been surprisingly rewarding
    trying to bring the two styles/weights/epochs/etc together. Lots of complementary
    qualities. \r\n\r\nThanks again, very helpful and educational.\r\n\r\n-Matt"
