body: We've had great feedback on our printed annual report. Now the president of
  our small nonprofit wants us to enter the report in various design competitions.
  Any suggestions for where to submit? Thanks.

  body: "Since you are posting on typophile one hopes your annual report is just a
    stunning typographic masterpiece. If you think it is, you should enter it in the
    next TDC competition. \r\n\r\nWinning entries are published in the TDC annual,
    and travel the world in their many traveling exhibits.\r\n\r\nI'm shocked no one
    has suggested this to you before.\r\n\r\nhttp://tdc.org/"

  body: Or you could take your glorious annual reports and put them in envelopes with
    100-dollar bills and throw the envelopes out into the street. Design competitions
    are all a bunch of cons. You give them money and hope that the judges will pick
    your work to be put in some stupid book which sells for 50-dollars at Barns and
    Noble. But unless your best friends with the judges, your never going to get picked.

    as off the radar as you can get.
