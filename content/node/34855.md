  restriction on avatars? (As you can see, mine's chopped...)

  body: "I raised this issue previously and got no response. Maybe the programmers
    do read stuff on the bug list, but there aren't as many responses as there are
    bug reports, and so the same bugs get reported over and over.\r\n\r\nApparently
    the size limit is 60 x 60. I don't know if it was that size before or not; in
    any case an avatar still worked if it was slightly over. One of the benefits of
    the redesign is forced compliance (truncation). "

  body: "The flute player was Kokopelli.\r\n\r\nKokopelli is a figure commonly found
    in petroglyphs and pottery throughout the southwest. He Is regarded as the universal
    symbol of fertility for all life, be it crops, hopes, dreams, or love. The first
    known images of him appear on Hohokam pottery dated to sometime between AD 750
    and AD 850. He is also a trickster god and represents the spirit of music.\r\n\r\nSorry
    to let it go, but Kokopelli suffered severely by the new avatar size enforcement,
    and I tried reducing it to the required 60 x 60 but my results were too fuzzy
    and jaggy and weren't very clear. If I knew how to keep the resolution at a reduced
    size, I'd go back to using it again.\r\n\r\nMy new avatar is the logo I use on
    my newsletter <em><strong>&cetera</em></strong> and symbolizes my belief that
    heart-smart and head-smart both count, but heart-smart counts more. Thanks for
    noticing, Mili."

  body: Miss G, you're still only 60px tall. Mine, on the other hand (and <em>grrrrrrrr</em>
    to forced restrictions...), is screwed. We are typographers, right? Working quite
    often with book spreads, right? Squares. What the hell with the squares! Ah, but
    there is a spread in the square, of course, just a <em>really</em> small one...

    of the Drupal (Typophile's platform) upgrade. It wasn't manually enforced.

    tingly every time you see a sesquiocular 'g'. Why is that? Was there some moment
    of ecstatic joy in your childhood in which a Baskerville 'g' played a significant
    role?\r\n\r\nInquiring minds want to know.\r\n\r\nBeautiful new avatars, everybody,
    btw. It's time to redo mine. I did it as an understated visual pun around the
    time the first drupal redesign happened, but I think it has served its term. All
    these little patches of color are so happy, like a flower garden. I'll see if
    I find some inspiration soon."

  body: "No, I'm pretty sure it's the horns and tail that make me tingly. But if it's
    the 1.5 eyes, it still can't be due to Baskerville, I don't think. Was there a
    lot of Baskerville in late-70s Palo Alto? Because I'm pretty sure there wasn't
    in early-70s or 80s Beirut... Plus I don't even really like Baskerville's: it's
    too apologetic, too English.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think my avatar is surviving the reduction
    in the page footers quite well (I <em>do</em> have a thing for optical scaling
    after all :-) although I'm not happy about the glaring aliasing in my eyebrow.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "More: I think my love for the open-bottom binocular \"g\" (still easier to
    type out than \"sesquiocular\" :-) comes from a desire to shoot down convention;
    and replacing a stale convention with something better is a nice bonus. :-)  It's
    a supreme case of a subtle but significant improvement to what so many people
    blindly assume is the ideal form. When you think about it, the conventional binocular
    \"g\" is too complex to fit with the rest of the alphabet; it's almost like a
    Chinese logograph. We -and readers- might not notice a problem most of the time,
    but especially when it's doubled, it can jump out. The open-bottom one is a much
    more harmonious and functional solution. Danm shame most designers who use it
    do it merely for fashion though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
