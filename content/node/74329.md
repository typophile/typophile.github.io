body: "Hello. I've been a long time lurker, so I've finally decided to join in and
  get advice. I've been into fonts ever since I was a kid, especially those from logos.
  I design my own by shaping them on PowerPoint and transferring the glyphs to High-Logic's
  Font Creator Program.\r\n\r\nThus far I've done some modernized fonts based on the
  classic \"Press Your Luck\" logo; one is regular and the other is extended, but
  I have some fine-tuning to do (the corners of the letters are rounded or beveled,
  which I don't want). Ray Larabie is known for recreating fonts from logos, and though
  this is a parody in the same vein, do I need to seek legal permission before publishing
  the font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BigBox template_4539.png]"

  body: Oh wow! Okay, thanks for informing me. Rekord is a nice set and the characters
    are definitely too close for comfort. I do have some original sets in the work,
    and I'd appreciate everyone's critique in the near future.

  body: Usually a reference like that means "it's useful to see what others have done
    in this vein while you develop yours." Anybody who wants to say "this is too similar
    to another face to be worthwhile" will say so very explicitly. We can distinguish
    Helvetica from Aksidenz Grotesk around here, so apart from the odd troll it's
    very rare anyone expresses that conclusion. Maybe it's not super-original, but
    if you feel like doing it, let the market decide... You never know, someone could
    come in here tomorrow or years from now, like they do every day, and ask "I like
    Rekord and Orbitron but neither is quite what I need for what I'm doing; I want
    something <em>really really square.</em> What do you recommend?"

  body: Oh, no problem! Again, I appreciate the help and I will post more fonts (including
    updates on this one) for critique in the very near future.
