  is the balance between monotony and overindulgence.</strong>\r\n\r\nI don't know
  who said it, but I love the simplicity of it. It really gets to the heart of where
  design starts and ends. \r\n\r\nFollowing in the foot steps from this thread (http://typophile.com/node/13406)
  are there any design specific quotes that are inspiring, you'd like to share?"

  body: "\"Pushpin Studios brilliantly married conceptual imagery (both illustration
    and photography) with eclectic, often decorative typography. They did so to make
    a specific point or to tell a joke. It seemed to me to be the most generous form
    of design. It told you what you needed to know and entertained you at the same
    time.\" -- <strong>Paula Scher</strong>\r\n\r\n\"If I can't think it, I can't
    do it.\" -- <strong>George Orwell</strong>\r\n\r\n\"To maintain any creative longevity
    a designer today must reinvent his or her work every five years. This does not
    mean simply changing style. It means reassessing one's approach -- again, design
    is an art of planning -- and finding a way that is new yet still reflects on one's
    core ethic and aesthetic. This entails a reevaluation of one's visual vocabulary,
    new technologies, the cultural zeitgeist, and the scale on which one works. Reinvention
    is personal growth.\" -- <strong>Paula Scher</strong>"
