  body: "Mac PostScript font files contain no kerning. The kerning is in the suitcase
    file, which is part of the reason you need both when installing.\r\n\r\nWhen opening
    Mac PostScript fonts in FontLab, you should open the suitcase file, not the PostScript
    file. You may see more than one font listed as suitcases may contain more than
    one font. Just choose the one you want, FontLab will know to get the outlines
    from the corresponding PostScript font (which should be in the same folder)."

  body: "A couple other things:\r\n\r\nWith Mac PostScript fonts, most of the information
    about a font from the point of view of the system is contained within the suitcase
    file, which includes screen fonts (at least one), metrics, kerning, family links,
    the filename of the corresponding PostScript font, etc. The PostScript file mainly
    contains the outline data and hints. It also includes character widths, but the
    metrics information is limited to that. The PostScript file has no information
    about the suitcase file, so FontLab doesn't know where to look for the metrics
    data if you open the PostScript file."

  body: On OS 9, with OpenType fonts, you need to make sure you have ATM 4.6 or later
    installed. In general, support for OpenType fonts on OS 9 is more limited than
    in OS X. Some older versions of Suitcase do not recognize them at all. It may
    be best to place them into the Fonts folder in the System Folder. QuarkXPress
    also has limited support for OT fonts, on either OS 9 or OS X. You can only access
    the basic Mac character set. This situation will change with version 7.
