  body: If it were me I would tighten the space around the o a bit. It&#39;s drifting
    away from the p.

  body: Broadly speaking, it seems that the round-to-round combinations are too loose
    compared the the straight-to-straight combinations. <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s nigh-impossible
    to tell what&#39;s due to kerning, and what&#39;s due to spacing. It would be
    very helpful to see an unkerned sample of the exact same text right below the
    kerned sample. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Overall, the &#34;before&#34; seems a little better. <BR> <BR>Kerning is
    not about keeping a constant amount of space between the closest points of letters,
    but rather about maintaining a total envelope of space equal from one combination
    to the next, while avoiding confusing overlaps or merging of shapes. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    the &#34;rt&#34; were a little close together in the original, but if so, you
    could open them up about 1/3 what you did. <BR> <BR>The &#34;ts&#34; really didn&#39;t
    need any modification from the original. Although some parts of the letters &#40;at
    the top and bottom&#41; come closer to each other, that&#39;s made up for by the
    white space between them in the middle. When you move them apart, you&#39;re giving
    them more total white space in between than the other letter combinations. <BR>
    <BR>I hope that&#39;s of some help! <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T '
