body: "I'm curious if there is some easy way to delete glyphs properly in FontLab
  Studio. When I change the name of a glyph FL Studio asks if I would like to have
  it changed in all the classes and feature code. That's quick and easy. When I delete
  a glyph, however, all it allows is deleting that cell. Then I have to wade through
  feature code, kern classes, OT classes, kern feature and so forth to remove each
  occurrence of that glyph as well. That is time consuming. \r\n\r\nMy plan was to
  delete all of the swash caps in a font that I am restructuring for a client. Then
  I need to add in 4 sets of swash caps and ligatures with the swash caps for stylistic
  sets. I don't really want to spend a week just wading through all this stuff. Any
  ideas?"

    to deleted characters with TextWrangler. It has a \u201CProcess lines containing\u201D
    feature that can delete every line containing a word. Alternately you could run
    sed in a loop to just strip out all the lines in all the files at once."

    does not have any effect for me. Does anyone know what it''s for?'

  body: "Never used TextWrangler. Might have to check that out.\r\n\r\n@Tim I didn't
    think about the clean up classes. That would have saved me a lot of time. I think
    I have gotten them out of all classes manually for now, but I'm checking as I
    go along. I've been deleting them a few at a time so if there is something lurking
    about still in the kern feature or OT feature code its easier to find. I had one
    that took me nearly half an hour to find. Seems to be going quicker now though.
    Thanks for the tips."

  body: Not long ago, I asked Adam to make a feature in the upcoming rev that will
    delete a glyph and all class and ot references as well. We will see if it happened
    when rev 6 comes out.
