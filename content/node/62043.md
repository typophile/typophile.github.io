  body: A magazine edito, but I think Calson Italic w/ Swashes looks way too much
    like the font used in the French Vogue...

  body: Thank you! Yes, Noir is my own making. It's not 100% finished yet, but if
    you would like to purchase a beta license, I'd be happy to let you.

  body: By the way, what other typefaces are you using? Who's your audience? Knowing
    that would make it easier to suggest something.
