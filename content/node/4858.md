body: Hello, here is an alphabet that I&#39;m working on with another student in Offenbach.
  The design is still in its first stages, so the text that you see is just illustrator
  vectors, not a working font. <BR> <BR>A few letters are bothering us in particular;
  c, f, l, t, and x. As usual any of your comments would be appreciated! <BR> <BR><img

  body: Yes, Titus, I do! Do you have a suggestion for the letter &#34;j&#34;? <BR>
    <BR>Below is a diagram illustrating some thoughts I have about the letter &#34;a&#34;.
    Would it be good to <i>romanize</i> the form? This would allow the presnt &#34;a&#34;
    to be more different in the italic. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36567.gif"

  body: i prefer also the second a. but the diagonal seems a bit thick to me.  <BR>perhaps
    the j could be just a straight line &#40;readability isn&#39;t really a big issue
    with your font i suppose&#41;.

  body: Ok. I&#39;ve lightend up the diagonal stroke on the &#34;a&#34; and made a
    straight &#34;j&#34;. Also in the diagram below, I&#39;ve illustrated a possible
    top-terminal change. Good idea? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36570.gif"

  body: 'i&#39;d say you have to make a basic decision: <BR>wether you go in a more
    &#34;roman&#34; direction, or if you decide to make it really funky, then you&#39;d
    have to make it even more unconventional. <BR> <BR>hope i could make clear what
    came to my mind.'
