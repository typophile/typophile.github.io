  Anything I try, I just get results with colliding curves and stems, N with appendaged
  S, or way too dark overlapping versions.\r\n\r\nIs there a combination for this
  letters that isn't completely ugly?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSN"

  body: "I assume you have tried wrapping the S around the N, and found it doesn't
    work. How about not overlapping the letters at all? Design a nice logo incorporating
    the letters ... I don't think that overlapping is a requirement of monograms.\r\n\r\n(My
    initials are DNM or DNMC, and in either case they also fail to flow from one to
    another. I chose to use a portion of a lower case d for my forum logo, in a case
    for simplicity and recognition.)"

  body: "I feel your pain. I did this in 1997. As you say, it gets very heavy, which
    is why I put the inline in the letters for something of a traditional taenia effect,
    which mitigates the heavyness. I used it as the logo for my design firm, steel
    engraved in gold, ironically contrasting faux and real dimensionality. But it
    wasn't good for business as bling isn't really my thing, and a lot of potential
    clients thought it looked like a dollar and I was only in it for the money! Maybe
    if I'd gone after some hip-hop clients... My Typophile avatar is also an NS monogram,
    the conceit being that the letters are configured for touchy-touchy.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NS_3722.png]"
