  shapes and tips on designing them? I'm looking for something similar to \"Designing
  Type\" by Karen Cheng and the tips presented in http://typographica.org/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/
  (optical corrections, balance, and so on).\r\n\r\nBesides of the general knowledge
  I'll get by reading that kind of material, I'm hoping to find info to deal with
  a problem I'm facing: character \"w\" in small sizes looks black, heavy, like a
  dot in a sea of grey lines. I guess there should be some info around regarding this.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    fact (although some don't agree) a font for text <em>must</em> exhibit a certain

      is what I thought. So, at the stage I'm in the font design process, I could
      basically just forget about the smaller sizes and focus on getting consistency
      at the \"normal\" size? Or do type designers typically deal with this optical
      sizes along with the normal weight design process?"
