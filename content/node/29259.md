  after his shameless scare tactic posters series, right? Right?\r\n\r\nWell, here's
  your chance, ladies and gentlemen. Though I have to admit that mine, being hastily
  made at 12:30 am, neither have the proper visual substance nor word/sentence pun.\r\n\r\nYou
  know, actually this topic would be a nice chance to get a visual overview of the
  many faces that we all made, completed or not.\r\n\r\nOf course you are welcome,
  too, Chris. I was just kidding :)\r\n\r\nAllright, let's get grilling.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glasses_5125.png]"
