  in the font list even when other programs like MSWord does. Other recently installed
  Chinese fonts do work like ones from <a href=\"http://www.sinosplice.com/chinese/fonts/\">here</a>.
  Is there a way to fix this? :\\\r\n\r\nI have Windows XP with Window's own language

    name \u2014 \"By JOSSQ-DMF in BeiJing\" \u2014, which was displayed in Photoshop
    CS's font list. I'd say the fonts in the second link are of better technical quality.\r\n\r\nYou
    could try to \"fix\" the fonts by starting to change their names with a font editor,
    like [[FontLab]], for example. However, there might be additional problems with
    these fonts, as the Unicode values and glyph names seemed to be all over the place.\r\n\r\n(Disclamer:
    I know nothing about Chinese fonts)"
