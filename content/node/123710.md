body: I'm working on a website for a client where I've been sketching with Domaine
  Sans Display Light on large main titles. It says coming soon on Klim Type's website
  and I have been crossing my fingers, but the deadline is closing in and I will have
  to find an alternative. Does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative sans that
  has a similar combination of elegance and lightness?

    hinted, but it is so thin you should really only use it for big sizes.\r\n\r\n(Edit:
    My memory of the lightest Domaine weight didn\u2019t match reality. Vinter is
    too thin. I might have something up my sleeve though, if you contact me directly)"

    </cite>\r\n\r\nHave you asked the foundry about it? Just because the webfont licensing
    is not yet available as online store functionality doesn\u2019t necessarily mean
    that the foundry isn\u2019t willing or able to provide webfonts on request. "

  body: "Thank you for some really nice suggestions. Frode, I've actually already
    looked at vinter. It's a beautiful typeface. (I'll send you an e-mail) And Ralf,
    your suggestion is good but I've already been in contact with the foundry and
    they couldn't give me any estimated time of arrival. \r\n\r\nI'm currently testing
    out [[http://fatype.com|Beausite Grand]] which has some of the characteristics
    of Domaine Sans although less of that crazy flair. But please, if anyone has any
    suggestions to add, do let me know. \r\n"
