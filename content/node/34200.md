body: "We have a book in where the designer chose Bembo as the text font. This book
  has a spattering of Turkish words; both the dotted and undoted i are used. Language
  tags were NOT used by either author or editor.\r\n\r\nNow an obvious design solution
  for this sort of text is to use a font like Sabon, where not using the fi ligature
  causes no problem. Set everything without fi & ffi ligatures, no need to sort between
  Turkish & English. But that's not how current designers think; she picked Bembo.\r\n\r\nBembo
  without ligatures doesn't really solve the problem for Turkish; the terminal of
  the \"f\" half blots out the dot on the \"i\". You would have to positive kern the
  \"i\" quite a bit to make the dot clear, and the resulting space would give rise
  to a different confusion.\r\n\r\nFor Bembo anyway, it isn't that hard to make a
  special fi ligature where the dot over the \"i\" rides a bit lower, and the terminal
  of the \"f\" doesn't swoop down quite so far. The dot on the \"i\" clearly shows,
  so we can have a \"f_i.dotted\" and a regular \"f\" and undotted i, which solves
  the problem nicely, visually. The only wrinkle is that with the sequence fii, the
  dots on the two i's wouldn't be quite the same height.\r\n\r\nThe author or editor
  will have to mark affected words in proof & we can make the switch. \r\n\r\nWhat
  I wonder though, is whether or not this will appear odd to anyone who regularly
  reads Turkish -- will it still be seen as an error, or \"unfortunate\"?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "Well, my Bembo has been pretty heavily modified. When we were still running
    repro --early-mid 1990s, I took a look at a couple of books, one a fine-print
    book from Steinhour press, one an old Penguin paperback from college days, & got
    a feel for the range of how Bembo printed in metal. First thing you noticed is
    that whoever made the PostScript Type 1 (3?) font shortened all the ascenders
    & descenders. Second thing you noticed was the contrast of the letters was all
    wrong when printed offset. So our Bembo got one large adjustment when we were
    running repro, and a second adjustment when DTP became prominant.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know how to post a picture here. I can easily make a PDF, but most sites only
    allow you to post a gif or jpeg. Dunno how to do that with type.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I suppose the taller ascenders would help with your solution, but also allow my
    proposed solution. I guess to give an answer you'd have to <cite>see</cite> it.\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n"

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nthere are some occasions where the sequence fii becomes important.
    for example the turkish word fiil (http://www.pratiksozluk.com/sozluk.php?word=fiil&dictionary=1)
    could be used in the mentioned text and it would be very unhappy for your eye,
    if the two i-dots differ in there height. It would look like an error. Maybe it
    could work, if you only modify the stem/terminal of the f, so you won't have two
    different versions of the dotted i. I also want to mention that the ligature of
    f and the dotted i is looking like the combination of f and the undotted i for
    the the turkish eyes. The best solution however would be to use a different typeface,
    if possible ;-) \r\n\r\nderya\r\np.s. sorry for the bad english.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild2_4486.jpg]"

  body: "As I said, my Bembo is modified with rather higher ascenders. There is no
    problem with making a ligature having the i dotted (wish I could show it). But
    I hear you --if two i's appear together, they better have the same height dots.
    The difference in height is so small that it can't be noticed between different
    words, only if next to each other. I can fix that, too.\r\n\r\nThe Bembo Book
    you show gives back some of the needed weight & contrast reduction, but it lost
    something, too.\r\n\r\nIn my world, the comp only gets to set the font the designer
    picks."

    change the ascender measure in my example, I would not either, no need for a ligature

  body: "Charles -- congrats on successfully uploading an image ;-)\r\n\r\nIt seems
    to me that if you're going to go ahead and lower the tittle on the i in a special
    cut of Bembo, then you don't really need an f_i ligature of any kind, since the
    f and i will coexist just fine without one.\r\n\r\nOr are you thinking that you'll
    leave the i alone, and construct a special, contextual i.alt that will substitute
    after the f_i.turkish lig?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm following you.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: "Kent,\r\n\r\nIf you look closely, the terminal on the f in the ligature is
    different (shorter) as well -- shorter than the regular \"f\", and of course,
    quite a bit shorter than the f in the ligature. It is closer to a f.terminal that
    we use when the f is followed by a space. I'm reluctant to change the font (database)
    by lowering the dot on the i globally at this point; maybe later. There isn't
    <cite>that</cite> much Turkish in the book in question.\r\n\r\nBTW, below an image

  body: "I suspect that the *high* position of the tittle in faces such as Bembo came
    about for the following reason:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it would have been
    quite possible to set an f followed by an i -- the i having a normally positioned
    tittle, as per Charles' fix--with the arm of the f kerning over the body of the
    i. However, this would have resulted in a lot of breakage in the reuse of type,
    as the \"beard\" of the arm and the tittle are awfully close.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    an f_i ligature was designed, with the arm of the \"f\" covering the position
    where the tittle might be, so it didn't look as if it was missing, just obscured.\r\n\r\nExcept,
    the tittle was relatively low, and the arm had to bend way down to hide its supposed
    position, and that looked odd.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the tittle was moved up, to make
    the f_i ligature more convincing.\r\n\r\nJust a theory."
