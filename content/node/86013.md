body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nIs there a fontlab function or a macro to highlight the composites
  in a font. I'm using fontQA to validate a font and it reports that one weight has
  more composites than other weights.\r\nIt's not a critical problem but i would like
  to know where the extra composites came from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nttmt"

  body: "In case you don't feel comfortable with adjusting the script, <a href=\"http://kltf.de/stuff/CompareComponents.zip\">here
    is one</a> that I think does what you need. Open exactly two fonts and run it.
    It compares all glyphs and reports glyphs whose number of components differs.
    Glyphs are identified by name, so glyph names should match in both fonts.\r\n(I
    guess that one of your glyphs carries two identical and same-positioned components
    which easily goes unnoticed.)"

  body: You can also use the Find... command (Edit menu). A small "find" window comes
    up with pop-up menus where you can choose "Components" and "more than" and then
    type 0 (zero) in the field. If you click on the check mark button, they will all
    be highlighted in red.
