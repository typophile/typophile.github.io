  we have a lot of text, because the site publishes tales, so I'd like some help and
  advice in my choices.\r\n\r\nA text example is here: http://vitoregia.googlepages.com/cap2.html
  (it's all in Portuguese, but I think it won't be a problem).\r\n\r\nIn the site,
  i used Trebuchet MS, a line-height (or leading) of 1.7 em, a less than 50% of width
  column for the principal text and a dark gray color for the text (#696969).\r\n\r\nTahnk
  for the attention, folks!"

    the size of font isn't so important."

  body: Trebuchet isn't the most readable web font -- its quirks are distracting at
    screen resolution. The best 5 are Lucida Grande (Lucida Sans Unicode on Windows),
    Georgia, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica. Give them all a try in Maratz's <a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/">Typetester</a>.

    Well, I really love Trebuchet, but Typetester show that there's better fonts,
    so I'll think more about this question. Or I'll let set the font as user's default.\r\n
    \r\nI'll try what you said and I'll be back eith the result.\r\n\r\nThaks a lot!"

    a better handwriting than what that typeface shows ?\r\nThose yellow & green are
    too \"fluo/saturated\" in my opinion.\r\nI'd also suggest not to fake small caps."

  body: Trebuchet is actually  not horrible to read if you space it just a bit, as
    the default word-spacing is so large.

  body: "Alessandro, maybe the logo have a problem with colors, but the subtitle in
    red is supposed to have a ugly typeface (or else I would use Scriptina ^^). And
    what you mean with \"fake smallcaps\"? \r\n\r\nConor, do you have a widescreen
    display? Cause in my resolution the line lenght is more short than the one in
    your picture.\r\n\r\nWell, finally I've chosen Verdana for text font, and Trebuchet
    for everything else. Check the page again:  http://vitoregia.googlepages.com/cap2.html\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Yes, though that won't look as nice with an 'A' or 'V'. Bold for the first
    sentence would be best.
