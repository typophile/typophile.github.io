  post for Centinella logo. This is the following up post. The world \"Centinela\"
  means \"guard\", client like a shield or perhaps a symbol to protrait trust, confident.
  So I stick with 2 of my old design (I know some of you did not like them) and made
  a new one out of a trojan head. I have one more version that I'm working on and
  I will post on here as soon as I finish. So here it is agian. Thanks you guys.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/centinela_2_6476.jpg]"

  body: "I dislike the top one.\r\n\r\nI think my favorites are the bottom two. I
    like the new centurion helmet mark. I think it could be enlarged in relation to
    the text, perhaps somewhere (size-wise) between the top one and where it is now.
    Also, not a huge fan of the shiny button look. What would it look like without
    that effect on it?\r\n\r\npenn"

    should try to apply the helmet mark to the first two designs."

  body: "yes. lose the gloss/chrome looks - they're not adding anything.\r\n\r\nThe
    centurian is a nice direction but I don't think it's working quite as well as
    it could. Its placement in the box/diamond isn't great. The first one seems to
    have a slight rotation upward which in my impression doesn't create the authoritarian
    pose it 'should' ... i.e, not much confidence. The diamond version doesn't work
    at all in my opinion, but the idea is nice.\r\n\r\nI don't mind the first one,
    but it didn't work in one colour from memory. Also ... if it's a shield, does
    the idea of the shield having been pierced by a sharp object create any unwanted
    stories?\r\n\r\nForget the second one.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    clear, even from a distance. I didn''t recognize that some of the other logos
    had helmets in them. The forth logo was clear. '

  body: "I don't like the shield version because it's too wide compared to its height.
    Shields were normally differently dimensioned.\r\n\r\nSome sure things:\r\n1.
    Don't pursue any more in the #1 and #2\r\n2. Use the simple helmet as in the rest
    of logos.\r\n\r\nThe only concern I have is that this symbol has been used many
    times. It depends how wide is this trademark going to be seen.\r\n\r\nMy gut tells
    me to go with #3 with minor changes: Top of the symbol continues the light square.
    I'd make it rounded as the symbol goes. It looks very nice and strong. Type goes
    well with it and it will be capable of small size applications. But I don't know
    how are you going to make a BW version of it.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "One more thing about #3. It uses a rather unusual type positioning. Most
    logos have either left/center/right aligned type. A small percentage of logos
    do it differently. Like you did. And that is intriguing and your version is also
    well balanced.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
