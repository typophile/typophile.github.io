  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey Guys &amp; Girls, at the end of this year I will have finished my Bachelor of Design and will be looking for placement within an agency as an entry level designer.</p>
<p>CV questions</p>
<p>I have no previous full-time/part-time employment in the design industry should I put down freelance works I have done?</p>
<p>Should I display my past employment if its not design relevant?</p>
<p>Portfolio questions</p>
<p>My best work has always been done at university, so should I only use my university work or is it best to show some freelance work I&rsquo;ve done so that they can see what I do for actual clients?</p>
<p>Should I display a variety of work, or try and limit it to the scope of the agency I am applying for?</p>
<p>Any advice would be really appreciated</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>My advice is to include everything you&rsquo;ve ever done to show advancement, and having your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> URL (not university-provided space) is good to have onsite.</p>
<p>I have a blog of my time so far <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want a heads up of what to expect(ish).</p>
<p>Every piece of freelance is good stock, but University work is also good to have (especially if your personal work is lacking in amount).</p>
<p>Above all, wear a suit to every interview - it&rsquo;ll help make that essential first impression, and show how serious &amp; dedicated you are to your craft.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t list &ldquo;flipped burgers for a semester at BK&rdquo; but if the job is interesting, absolutely. Work experience is work experience. And definitely list your freelance works/talents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, wear a suit to every interview&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d agree with that. Scout out the firm first. If the principals are wearing t-shirts and flip-flops, a suit might be a bit overkill. Design firm dress code can run the gamut.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you have past employment that is not directly design-related, but you learned or demonstrated transferable skills, I would include it: No need to detail your job duties, but do talk about the skills you used to perform the duties.</p>
<p>So, for example, I worked for a few years as a sales person in a dressmaking supply shop. It was far from the work I do producing publications, but I was using and developing problem solving skills in a way which does relate to design &ndash; finding a solution within the customer&rsquo;s budget and which would complement the look of whatever they were making/repairing/sewing.</p>
<p>Skills are transferable. For example, timeliness, attention to detail, accuracy&hellip; You can list the skills a particular position required of you.</p>
<p>Also, any accomplishments &ndash; like improving a work process or signage or reorganizing something, increasing sales, developing a loyal clientele &hellip; in other words, a contribution other than your basic duties.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you have just finished your university degree, most employers are not going to be expecting a long list of fabulous jobs. I&rsquo;d advise summarizing your work experience briefly, as it&rsquo;s not design-related. You do want to show you&rsquo;ve had some work experience but you don&rsquo;t need to go into overkill explaining how skillfully you stocked those grocery shelves. In general I think descriptions of your jobs should be brief and to the point.</p>
<p>Yes, show both your school work and your completed jobs. Again, nobody is expecting you to have designed the iPhone interface.</p>
<p>But please please avoid the common student mistake of too many words on the CV. I can&rsquo;t stand lengthy &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; (your objective is to get a f**king job, innit?). Someone on this site posted a 6 page CV for critique where we had to page thru 5 pages of words words words before we even got to the actual resume. Something elegant and concise is vastly preferable. It should fit on a page. I have 20+ years work experience and my resume fits on a page.</p>
<p>As to wearing a suit? Seems a little much to me, but don&rsquo;t show up in jeans either. Black or grey pants, a simple button down (no tie) and a jacket should do the trick.</p>

<p>As for the portfolio, show only your best work &ndash; do not put anything in there that you will be apologizing for. It&rsquo;s better to have 3 or 4 very good samples than 8 or 10 that vary in quality or execution.</p>
<p>Also, do your homework about the firms you will be applying to, and if possible, tailor the contents of your portfolio to a particular studio&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>My rule is to always go a step above what the office is. If it is t-s and torn jeans, then a tie is overkill. But if it is dress shirts and slacks, then throw on a tie. And if they have on a tie, go up to a full suit. (The rule breaks down here &hellip; if they are in suits, a tux is a bit too much).</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t scope out the place on a Friday to see what the normal dress is &hellip; many places dress down that day.</p>

<p>I would, if ther is absolutely no other work experience. It tells at least that you were able to get to work on time, work with others, and haven&rsquo;t been living off Daddy&rsquo;s largesse all your life. It doesn&rsquo;t mean much, and I would drop it as soon as you get relevent experience, but it does mean something.</p>
