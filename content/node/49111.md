  used to set the text in Low Life (the wonderful book by Luc Sante). The closest
  I've gotten is Nick Shinn's Walburn, but that's not it. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n(Sorry the sample is so small, I'm not near a scanner at the
  moment and had to steal a screen grab from Amazon)"

    Caledonia</a> to me.

  body: Thanks for the response. It's not New Caledonia, but that got me on the right
    track. It's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bulmer/|Bulmer]].
