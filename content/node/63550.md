  in fortune magazine's title.\r\nI love the magazine's high end business appeal and
  am trying to achieve this look in some of my work.\r\nAny help would be awesome.\r\nAlso
  any suggestions of other type that have this mature financial feel would be awesome.\r\nThanks!"

    forum. However, if you are looking for something similar, Monotype's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/mentor/|Mentor]],
    by Michael Harvey, seems close, except that the stress on the O is not angled.\r\n\r\n-
