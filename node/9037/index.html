  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've just recieved an interesting project at Uni, to start we have to define 5 of each, ugly/boring and beautiful/cool typefaces. We then take one forward and produce A2 posters for each, advertising a type exhibition, and then we combine the two typefaces together to create the final poster&hellip; <BR> <BR>At the moment my choices for ugly / boring are typefaces I see everyday, books, magazines, newspapers&hellip; Garamond for example, I just need to find the correct one with a little intersting history, I'm hoping someone here, with a better understanding of type will know the seedy past of one of these sort of typefaces. Although, any typeface used in the correct fashion can be beautiful, and these typefaces are obviously well crafted&hellip; Its just you see them everyday, and they're made to disapear into the page rather than be 'interesting' in there own right. <BR> <BR>For my Beautiful typeface i'm looking at the moment to use woodblock type, I like the personality of it, however, its a method rather than a typeface, so I need to find the classic woodblock face, something along the lines of what 'Frost' use in a lot of there designs&hellip; Either that or i'll be looking at a battle between old and new, then using something like Design Shock&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Its a hard choice to make. We also have to find typefaces with an interesting history&hellip; which cuts a lot out of the equation&hellip; <BR> <BR>Any ideas, and what would your top 5's be?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Check out <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">MyFonts.com</a>. They have a keyword search of thousands of fonts. This should help you narrow down based on your general ideas (like &quot;wood type&quot;). <BR> <BR>As for boring, check out what the banks are using. 9 times out of 10 (at least here in the states) they are conservative and uninspired choices. Also, any business-to-business materials. You'll probably find more Rotis and Gill Sans than you can shake a stick at&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rob - did your proff offer a definition of what is ugly and what is beautiful? If not, I would start there. Create a set of criteria for each. I get the feeling that if you have a set rationale as to why you decided each was classified as either ugly or beautiful you will get a better grade. <BR> <BR>For instance, I am willing to wager that many here will see Garamond as beautiful - but for differing reasons. It is all so subjective. <BR> <BR>If you define your criteria - on paper - you will be able to show that you have thought out your choices and can defend them in a rational way. <BR> <BR>You proff will love you for that. Well, maybe. <BR> <BR>;) <BR> <BR>Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes I agree, Garamond on both points about the typface, I think it can be defined as both a beautiful and an ugly typface. <BR> <BR>The brief goes like this : and no the lecturer, suprisingly wants us to make our own decisions&hellip; <BR> <BR>Select a typefont that you consider ugly (boring, dull) and another you find beautiful (sexy, cool). Produce an A2 full colour poster for each font containing the following :  <BR> <BR>it then goes on to explain that we need to include an A - Z or an mnemonic showing the type family in 3 of its design weights. (Out of interst are there any other mnemonics apart from the 'Quick brown fox&hellip;' ) <BR> <BR>So.. at the moment, the words 'Boring &amp; Dull' are my main motives for choosing Garamond. But as you say Mike, a clearly defined criteria would help me choose, and get me more browny points. It seems I have a little developing to do. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Thanks for the info, i'll report back soon, and any more additional comments are appreciated. <BR> <BR>Rob.</div>
