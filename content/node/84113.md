  body: With these items, one simply has to be patient and keep checking back. And
    be prepared to spend around $250, unless you just happen upon an eBay listing
    by someone who isn't aware of the going rate for these catalogs.

  body: "For a complete overview of all the fonts produced by Photo-Lettering you
    only need these two catalogs:\r\n\r\n\u2022 <strong>Photo-Lettering's One Line
    Manual of Styles (1971)</strong>\r\n\r\nIndex to Alphabet Thesaurus vol. 3. 2
    and 1 plus new fonts never shown before by Photo-Lettering. For a long time I
    thought the One Line Manual was the last time \r\nPhoto-Lettering showed new fonts.
    In 2006 the late Bob Alonso, who worked for Photo-Lettering for over 33 years,
    wrote me in an e-mail: \r\n\u201CThe last publication Photo-Lettering put out
    showing new fonts was the supplement to the one liner (probably very hard to find).
    There was I believe a few more supplements put out after that but they were not
    showing any new fonts just trend setting Ideas and maybe some existing fonts that
    were digitized for the MAC.\u201D \r\n\r\n\u2022 <strong>Supplement to Photo-Lettering's
    One Line Manual of Styles (1974)</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nBooklet of 24 pages with
    22 pages showing new fonts. The lay out is exactly the same as the One Liner.
    Since Bob Alonso brought this book to my attention I\u2019ve been looking for
    it. Last january I finally managed to purchase a copy, so it took me 5 years to
    find one!\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if you already own copies of these books, but
    if not, I recommand to buy them if possible!\r\n"
