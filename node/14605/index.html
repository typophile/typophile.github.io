  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Jogging home from my morning coffee, I came up with a rather evil idea that combines two of my obsessions: type (scientific research thereof) and puzzles.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sudoku<!-- raw HTML omitted --> puzzles have swept the UK, and are just now gaining popularity in the states. In my experience, they&rsquo;re much like crosswords, but with much more emphasis on the logic and, of course, with no dependence on word knowledge. Among other things, my five year old son Max is starting get into them (he now does easy ones with me giving hints).</p>
<p>Being <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at Sudoku means doing very intense visual decoding work - scanning rows, columns, and boxes for the presence or absence of symbols. Any mistake can well be deadly. Thus, the shapes must be highly distinguishable. There is already some theorizing on optimum choices for the symbols. According to the &ldquo;Solving Sudoku&rdquo; document at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sudoku.org.uk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Sudoku is not a mathematical or arithmetical puzzle. It works just as well if the  numbers are substituted with letters or some other symbols, but numbers work best.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I suspect this may be because the brain tends to be well trained in picking out patterns in numbers.</p>
<p>Almost all published Sudoku puzzles I&rsquo;ve seen use simple Helvetica digits. Is this optimum in any sense, or just convention? Would a choice of other fonts make any difference at all? How much of an edge do numbers have over letters or other symbol sets. Would the addition of color, shading, or texture help or distract?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that it may be possible to answer all these questions by crafting an online research study. The central component of this study would be a friendly website that offers interactive Sudoku puzzles, then collects statistics on the time to complete, probability of success, number of &ldquo;undo&quot;s, etc. When the puzzle is served, the number image set is chosen randomly from a pool, then recorded in the stats for subsequent correlation with the success stats. Further, cookies could keep track of multiple puzzles by the same player, which might yield insight into the process of learning.</p>
<p>A very common problem in readability studies is poor aesthetic choices for fonts and setting. We could avoid that handily by soliciting contributions of number image sets from the extremely talented Typophile community. Creating an image set is a simple project, so I would expect a diverse range of creative and well-executed submissions. People with particular theories about readability (or legibility, or readerability, or whatever) would also have a chance to test out their ideas.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that this project would fly. The Sudoku form solves a number of problems common to this type of research, not least of which is recruiting subjects. A well-executed website would have almost guaranteed popularity. I can also imagine that the raw data would be useful to other researchers, including cognitive scientists.</p>
<p>Of course, being as busy as I am, there&rsquo;s no way I have time to set up such a project myself. I am intrigued enough, though, that I am open to collaborating with another person or two. I imagine I&rsquo;d take responsibility for the more rocket-science aspects, including wiring up an open-source Sudoku generator, probably doing the Javascript for the interactive puzzle, and overseeing the statistics, doing my best to make sure that the experimental design is valid. What I&rsquo;d expect a collaborator to do is primarily webmastery, doing the text and graphics for the site, promoting it in various forums, and coordinating the submission of image-sets. It would also be nice to have someone who was willing to help write up the results as a paper (very likely publishable).</p>
<p>Ideas? Interest? Expressions of derision at the sheer craziness of the idea?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t tried Sudoku, so at first, the notion seems a little complex to me. My main interested would be if there is a demonstratable benefit in decoding or building Sudoku puzzles for students of design, and particularly, typography.</p>
<p>A few of us are already exploring the possible uses of visual games and activities as potential tools for training/sensitizing young designers.  We hope to expand the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typographic Edumacators<!-- raw HTML omitted --> topic area with ideas, suggestions, experiments and proposals. Please feel free to expand on the topic of Sudoku.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, here is a link to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sugaku Font Series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Luc Devroye&rsquo;s site that might be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m old, but I&rsquo;m back in style!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The Minneapolis Star-Tribune just started running these, and I enjoy filling them out. I would think one type issue would be that the numbers must be easily copied by the puzzler, since the nature of the puzzle means that he or she is constantly scanning both printed and filled-in numbers together. That would be another factor besides readability/legibility that would come into play.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>eliason: Yeah, that occurred to me too. So shouldn&rsquo;t it be Comic Sans rather than Helvetica? (or Arial, as the case may be)</p>
<p>In any case, matching written numbers should only be relevant for dead-trees versions. To work a puzzle online, the full spectrum of fonts, colors, etc., are available.</p>
