  body: "Good find Kevin. Another interesting Art Deco style serifed font digitized
    during the first wave of making digital fonts [1991] by a font-maker -- Sterling
    Court Publishing -- who left no records as to provenance. I found nothing matching
    from other sources.\r\nNote some really unique letters, like the _J_ that looks
    identical to the _T_ but with a backwards facing tail.\r\nIf anyone wants more
    fonts from Sterling Court Publishing Luc Devroye's page  http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-36181.html
    has a font list. Unfortunately his link to a package download no longer works.
    See also http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-36183.html\r\n\r\n****\r\nUPDATE\r\nSome
    or all of the fonts by Jim Pearson as Sterling Court Publishing are here http://www.fontage.com/foundry/jpearson.html\r\nDon"

    touch.
