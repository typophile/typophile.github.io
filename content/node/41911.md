  friend of mine told me i shouldn't have the pink/blue on both the highlighted text
  and the background lines as the same colour. You guys agree?\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  time.\r\n\r\nDan."

  body: "It kinda looks muted instead of highlighted to me... Especially in the blue
    one... I'm not sure if that's due to the specific colors or if it's just that
    it's in the background element as well - but yeah, I'd look into alternatives
    if I were you...\r\n\r\nTry something in the same hue, but a little lighter on
    the background, or darker on the highlights, for instance, or try a different
    color alltogether... Or perhaps make the color a solid background to the highlighted
    words, with white text? (Though that may be a bit too much, as it's the same 'style'
    you've chosen for your main headlines..)"

  body: "Hi Dan\r\n\r\nYou are not insane :)\r\n\r\nTo me the black text seems a lot
    stronger than the highlight colors you have chosen. Using the same color in the
    background lessens the highlighting effect even more.\r\n\r\nI would have all
    text the same color, or emphasis words using a stronger weight rather than color.
    \r\n\r\nOr you could try using a dark grey for the secondary text and a stronger
    color for the highlighted words.\r\n\r\nI am thinking if this gets printed by
    a potential employer on a standard black and white printer, possibly photocopied
    and sent around the pale colors will be lost all together. \r\n\r\nI also think
    having you text set in one color increases the legibility. It does depend on the
    sort of job you are going for, you want your resume to make an impact visually
    but you also want it to be easily read.  \r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nZennie"

  body: "I think this design is insane.  The diagonal lines are extremely distracting;
    your resume would be *much* easier to read without them.  It would even be easier
    to read with vertical or horizontal lines -- diagonal lines are the worst.  The
    pink is especially visually assaulting. \r\n\r\nI think the diagonal lines contradict
    the line that says \"Skilled at communicating through considered typography.\"
    \r\n\r\nI assume you'll be submitting some sort of portfolio or collection of
    work with this resume -- let *that* speak for your design abilities and keep the
    resume simple and clean.\r\n\r\nIf you were to keep the stripes, which you shouldn't
    do, make them lighter, thinner, and increase the empty margins around the text.
    \r\n\r\nI don't mean to be overly negative, but I do think it's a bad choice. "

  body: I agree with glyph...a resume is one of those places to play it safe. Not
    that it can't be decorated, but, really, the text is what's key.

    a very particular type of 'client' so I think you were definitely in the right
    by 'prettying it up' a bit."
