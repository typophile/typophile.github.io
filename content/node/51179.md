body: "I exported my typeface in FontLab in roman and oblique. It worked fine for
  a while when I used it in Illustrator, previewing in the drop-down character menu
  in both regular and oblique. Once I tried selecting the typeface in Photoshop, the
  roman wouldn't work, just the oblique, and when I went back into Illustrator, it
  did the same. I don't know what to do, I think this is a mastering issue. Could
  someone please help? Thanks.\r\n\r\n "
