    concert, or if I were already at the concert, buy the poster as a memento.\r\n\r\nThose
    photos of Paul look so stock photography.\r\n\r\nWatch your alignments with different
    elements. Also, I would make the quote from \"The End\" ragged left instead of
    ragged right."

    quote. It actually started as pure typography and then the suits got involved
    and demanded photos. There goes the glory of the world\u2026\r\npeace"

  body: Those are truly awful pictures of a guy over 50 trying to look young. What
    I would suggest is using only one photo, make it large so you don't focus on the
    retouching, awful. Egos are larger than heros

    - you should see them full size - they are much scarier. I have no choice in this
    matter so I tried to minimize their impact by making them smaller and enclosing
    them in some kind of structure. \r\n\r\n- Egos are larger than heros -\r\nIn my
    position I'm stuck between the loved and the lovers. It's very hard to tell who

  body: "I wonder why the brown? I think I might like a stronger color to go with
    paul & the blue in the backgrounds of the photos. What about some sort of Fushia
    purple or red? It's hard to know if I am seeing the real color you intend of course...
    Photos-wise I think I like the blue backgrounds best. Any chance they could all
    be blue? In terms of layout the U bothers me a little because the bowl of the
    'u' isn't as plain as the openings in the other letters. Maybe the photo could
    blend into the background a bit towards the edge. Actually. Did you try black
    letters ( or deep grey ) & a white background? That might be sweet. What about
    breaking the thing into 4 rectangles like this:\r\n\r\nP    A\r\n\r\nU    L\r\n\r\nThat's
    what occurs to me at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Paul I have an idea. Take one of the pictures and make it black and white,
    colorize it and posterize it. Make the picture into a icon and use it as a background
    and insert small photos if needed.

  body: "Now we're rolling - so far I have played with Ebens ideas - the bowl of the
    u is slightly altered to appear a little more regular. I really like the blue
    background thing so I replaced the top and bottom photo backgrounds - the masking
    is down and dirty right now - nothing like masking hair! I like the white with
    black text - but unfortunately the suits seem to think that we have to get our
    moneys worth out of the ink we use - so white space here is generally a no no.
    We shall see. Perhaps Dans idea is the answer to this although in my mind it gets
    a little busy - you never know\u2026\r\n<a href=\"http://pages.sbcglobal.net/pbc1313/temp/temporary.html\">adverts</a>\r\nthanks

    have four squares with photos (b/w and halftone them), and then have one letter
    in every square, in full color, covering parts of the photos.  Plus one part tasteful

    can you retouch it and the cable out and centre the figure in the counter (if
    you are not allowed to retouch, by centering it you would make more sense of the
    amp). The picture in the U looks stretched horizontally and the quote doesn't
    appear to have a relationship with anything else, maybe by removing the picture
    in the U and using the counter for the quote it will tie in. The column of addresses
    is also looking out of kilter with the logo.\r\nTim"
