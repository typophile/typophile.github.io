body: "Dear Typophile Geniuses,\r\n\r\nI've been dabbling in freelance design for
  the last year and I've been a photographer for several years and finally decided
  to make a logo for myself... It's still a little rough, but I'd like some feedback/critique
  on the idea and the general icon. It's nothing too fancy, I am just using my Initials
  for the icon, the lettering is based off Didot. And the name is in Helvetica Neue
  (But I'm sure you all already knew that) :).\r\n\r\nThe leaves would represent \"Fresh
  Ideas\" I guess... (I didn't put a lot of thought in the symbolism). I had the idea
  that I could change the color of the leaves with the season if I wanted to, or have
  something growing out of the icon horizontally...\r\n\r\nThe one worry I have is
  that \"leaves\" don't necessarily = design and photography.\r\n\r\nYour comments
  are much appreciated!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rglogo_3422.jpg]"

  body: "I don't have any problem with the leaves=freshness symbolism. It also may
    generally relate to your photography (if you do landscapes and such (i don't know)).
    Really all that matters about meaning is if you're happy with it. I find that
    most people, when it comes to personal marketing endeavors, are willing to afford
    the artist a large amount of \"symbolic & thematic breathing room\" (if you will)
    in his branding. So, if you're happy, the client/visitor is happy.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem I have with this is with the blockiness of the lettering in relation to
    the fluidity of the leaves where they interact. The space with the leaves is quite
    beautiful, but then my eyes are attacked when they venture out into the spine
    of the \"R\" and both the top and bottom cleffs of the \"G\". I think if you refine
    those shapes and get more of a consistent fluidity flowing from the leaves it'll
    be much more cohesive. If it's not clear what I mean, let me know and I can do
    a quick example in illustrator (I'd do one now, but I'm in a bit of a rush).\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "RG/leaves is a great concept.  It would be good though to see some other
    type options there, perhaps something more freehand or casual.\r\n\r\nThe size
    of the 'graphic design...' text is so tiny compared to the RG I just don't know
    how practical you mark will be unless displayed at every large sizes.  How about
    stacking the text or finding a narrower font you can set at a larger size?\r\n\r\nFinally
    and this is very much just a personal opinion, I think you can find a more interesting
    face than Helvetica for your name."

  body: "Overall the logo could use a few tweeks:\r\n1. The upper lobe on the R seems
    too short, I would consider\r\nbringing the waist down a bit closer to the baseline.\r\n2.
    Line up the right edge of the upper serif on the G with the right edge of its
    throat\r\n3. The upper serif on the G doesn't work with the other serifs.\r\n\r\nOne
    final comment in terms of marketing... A basic principle of marketing is that
    divergence has more impact on consumers, and therefore more successful,than convergence.
    The description under your logo mentions both Graphic Design and Photography.
    You may want to taylor the focus on one area depending on the audience you are
    communicating too. In my own experience, what customers look for in a graphic
    designer differs from a photographer as they are really different mediums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMichael

    are the changes that I made to the logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/revisedlogo_6303.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    am alot happier with it, but i'm gonna keep playing around with it 'cause it still
    doesn't quite hve the right \"feel\" to it yet ;) (that's horribly ambiguous I
    know :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRick"

  body: "The star thing isn't really working I'm afraid. It just kind of floats there.\r\n\r\nYou
    should probably find a typeface with true small capitals or manually adjust the
    weights, because right now the G, D, and P on the bottom line look very dark compared
    to the rest of their words.\r\n\r\nThe modern serif face in your RG ligature and
    the older style in your name seem to clash.  I'd either choose more similar styles
    or go back to sans-serif.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal line is good.  \r\n\r\nHow about
    showing us the RG in a totally different font style? IMO the current rigidity
    does not lend itself to the natural motif."

  body: "This is a big step backwards. The serif face you now have for your name no
    longer matches your mark. The star means nothing and in no way relates to the
    rest of the mark. The top of the \"G\" looks unfinished.\r\n\r\nI liked the look
    of the Helvetica much better. To me, the serif face paired with the line reminds
    me of a law office logo.\r\n\r\nForgive the crudeness of the sketch, but here
    is what I meant before about smoothing the serifs on the \"R\" and \"G\" of the
    mark:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rglogo-serifs_4042.png]\r\n\r\nI
    just used a face that had more curve to its serifs, but you can modify yours to
    have a crisper didot-like finish. I'm just thinking that if you add a curve to
    the serifs it'll soften the hardness and blockiness that, right now, plagues the
    mark.\r\n\r\npenn"
