  of the WW2 German Enigma coding machines? I've been searching the web for Grotesk
  typefaces, but have yet to find one with correct Q, R and E characters. I'm wondering
  if it was a custom face?\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC=\"http://www.ilord.com/images/enigma/enigma-keyboard.jpg\"

    English-speaking world.\r\n\r\nThe letters appear to have been made using a Leroy
    lettering guide."

  body: "[[http://world.std.com/~jdostale/kbd/SpaceCadet2.jpeg|Here]] is an image
    of a computer keyboard which, while unusual in one way, is like many other typical
    old-style computer keyboards (before the IBM PC changed the normal design of keys
    on a computer keyboard) in having the lettering for the keys originally mastered
    using a Leroy lettering guide.\r\n\r\nThe letter G on both Enigmas pictured indeed
    doesn't match what is there; the Q on the first one does, and the other letters
    seem very similar to me. In Germany, the standard used for lettering in drafting
    is very different from what is normal in the United States; the same standard
    is used in Russia, and is visible in illustrations in many Russian-language technical
    books, at least of the Soviet era.\r\n\r\nThe Q in the second image resembles
    that seen on Enigmas with plastic keys rather than windowed metal keys."
