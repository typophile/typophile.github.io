  anything like this exist out there yet? \r\nhttp://www.salsen.com/alphabet.gif"

  body: "Koleslaw: There are lots of other \"hip-hop\" inspired fonts out there, none
    of which are very notable as of yet. I suggest you avoid looking at any of them
    for reference.\r\n\r\nThis one is an okay stab at it all, however I suggest a
    little more research on the topic of graffiti \"handstyles.\" You have some good
    weight going on here, but I think its overall shapes are too \"safe\" to be associated
    with hip-hop. I would love to see more contrast in the line weight. \r\n\r\nGraffiti
    has some distinct explorations in its glyphs; fueled by the tool, speed, individuality,
    influence, and lack of knowledge when it comes to traditional lettering (I feel
    this is a positive thing). A good hand came from refining your alphabet till its
    quirky characteristics matched stylistically, but not in a modular sense. \r\n\r\nTry
    holding your marker at a higher degree, maybe 45?\r\n\r\nThe \"S\" is a little
    troubling compared to the rest also.\r\n\r\nHope that helps \r\n"

  body: "Wes, I agree that this is a \"safe\" execution. It's intentional- hence,
    the \"hint\" of graffiti flavor. I want this first to be legible- unlike most
    of the existing graffiti fonts out there. Ironic, huh? I'm trying to push the
    limits- to keep just an ounce that spontaneous drawn quality and ride the fine
    line that keeps it close to traditional letterforms. In the end, it's more graffiti-inspired
    than graffiti itself.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this being used in print at small sizes,
    which is why i decided to go more monoweight with it.\r\n\r\nSo now, ignoring
    the mentioned graffiti aspect of this, and considering the attractiveness of the
    letterforms, any other critiques? Good point about the \"S.\" Thanks for your
    comments!\r\n"

  body: There is no precedent in the other letters for the points at the top of the
    M to be sharp. Either introduce the sharp somewhere else, or shave the tops off
    the M. I'd say that the S has more flavor than the other characters. Either calm
    down the S or make the other characters move a little more. By itself, the S is
    pretty cool. The top of the R needs to be different from the P. The C is beautiful.

  body: "i agree. as for graffiti type letters its not working. I would say they do
    look less cheesy then most that i have seen.\r\n\r\nbtw--i've been a graffiti
    writer since the early 80's \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: yes, less cheesy is a good way to explain it. (Thats a good thing)
