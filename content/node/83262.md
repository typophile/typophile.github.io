  or read about the release of Elementar by Typotheque:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://im.typotheque.com/blog/Elementar_225.png\"/>\r\n\r\nhttp://typotheque.com/blog/elementar\r\nhttp://typotheque.com/blog/elementar_app\r\n\r\nI
  have been working on Elementar for a long time, and Typophile was an important source
  of information for me in the beginning of the project.\r\n\r\nSo, to announce the
  release, thank Typophile & close the cycle, here is a transcript of a \u201Clive
  critique\u201D chat session from around October/November 2002:\r\n\r\nhttp://hipertipo.org/stuff/typophile-live-critique.html\r\n\r\nI
  am more excited than ever about this project and its future developments, and very
  curious to see what people will build with it. \r\n\r\nThe work continues...\r\n\r\nGreetings
  from Amsterdam,\r\nGustavo.\r\n"
