  body: "For the masthead my first thought was some version of Impact but that\u2019s
    not it. It\u2019s also similar to the Microsoft typeface Haettenschweiler, and
    Helvetica Ultra Compressed (slightly expanded), but not every detail matches. "

  body: "Yes, it's definitely Freight. Thanks, fvilanakis. There's same nice type
    in use photos in http://www.dardenstudio.com\r\n\r\nAnd the logo font question
    remains open. It's a nice font. Is there any chance that it's not a custom one?\r\n\r\n"

  body: My gut feeling is that it was customised to suit the taste of the designer/make
    it unique or whatever, although it is possible they just mixed glyphs from more
    than one face to do this.

  body: 'Really a very nice car magazine cover. It looks really beautiful with the
    two colorful cars. Car with the car operators in the picture and it is really
    quite perfect for the cover page of Car and Driver magazine.  '
