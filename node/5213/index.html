It appears to have a lot of fonts that attempt to simulate existing fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris L has obviously no idea what ot takes to produce a commercial font collection.  The Expresiv Series was introduced at a time when a reasonable font package cost $1,000.  The Ornate collection, and 3 of the 6 collections were value font packages.  No excuses made about quality either - though most were intended for desktop users, they were extensively reviewed and praised at the time.  The products are not currently available.  And, yes, I was the publisher!  Regards, Tim McGuinness, Ph.D. - McGuinnessDesigns.com</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My concern is for the original designers as well. Many of these fonts look very similar to existing fonts by other designers. I would like to know whether the original font designers &#40;or the current owners of the drawings&#41; were contacted or compensated in some way. <BR> <BR>I tracked down the person who originally purchased the Expresiv font disk. The sense she got was that large font collections such as Expresiv simply weren&#39;t available at the time this collection was sold. Perhaps Thomas or someone else can confirm or deny this claim. Was there a lag time in the early years of desktop publishing in acquiring an extensive library of fonts? <BR> <BR>Thanks for speaking up, Tim. I&#39;m sure that assembling this collection was not an easy task at the time. Can you address our concerns about the original font designers that your collection is copying? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it seems someone has an axe to grind or two. <BR> <BR>FACTS: <BR> <BR>We aquired full rights and ownership for several major type houses, and published original designs.  We also published sets from other font houses under license, such as Monotype.  We also published under the original publisher&#39;s name as well &#40; a total of 99 unique products we published by us &#41; The Expresiv series of 19 products included type for over a dozen type houses &#40;names changed to protect their brands, but they still made their piece&#41; We simply had a different marketing model, oriented to expanding the market, as opposed to marketing to elitists.  As a result, we sold 100,000&#39;s, as opposed to simply 100&#39;s. <BR> <BR>We also sold significant clipart collections as well - in all cases original work, under license, paying the designers/owners royalties &#40;as we did with the fonts too&#41;.  It&#39;s easy to take cheap shots when you haven&#39;t a clue. <BR> <BR>It would also be interesting to look up the copyright laws on fonts.  Type houses have been &#34;knocking&#34; each other off for 100 years, because it is legal.  In general, we went after original and interesting collections.  We simply out marketed most others. <BR> <BR>Why are the collections not available now?  Simple.  The primary sales tool was my Graphics Express Catalog, which was the nations leading graphics product catalog.  It won numerous publishing industry awards for design quality.  Tacky only to an elitist.  It had a subscriber based of 500,000 per issue.  Our list came from companies like Monotype, Adobe, Corel, and others.  The catalog was discontinued in 1997 after the parent company was aquired by Global DirectMail, and I was turned towards moving the company&#39;s 16 domestic divisions, and 13 european divisions onto the web.  Thus, when the catalog was closed &#40;not because of profitability - but because of a change in focus&#41;, the product line &#40;Expresiv &amp; ProVektor, and the others&#41; were also discontinued.  They may be brought back fairly soon however. <BR> <BR>Reviewed:  The various products were reviewed by a variety of publications.  Including: Adobe Magazine, Aldus Magazine, Arts&amp;Letters Magazine, Corel Magazine, Desktop Publishing Magazine, Artworx Magazine, PC Magazine, PC World Magazine, and about 50 others.  As always, if you want to pay the price, your welcome to, most did not. <BR> <BR>I make no apologies about these products.  They enabled vast numbers of customers to produce exceptional designs.  There was variety in quality, such as the Ornate collection which was intended for lower level users.  But we also produced products equal to the best in the market, for a 20th the price.  And yes, there were other large collections in the market from MonoType, Adobe, and others; with prices of $1,000 or more!  Sometimes you make more selling for $29 than a $1,000 <BR> <BR>FYI, I also happen to be the co-inventor and co-designer of the worlds best selling low and high end forms design applications &#40;which has been in continuous distribution for 18 years!&#41;, as well as several major graphics apps.  I do understand the difference between the levels of the publishing industry.  My focus has always been on expanding the market by bringing quality at a lower price, as well as creating new product categories.  It&#39;s easy to rag on someone when you haven&#39;t produced yourself, but some of us actually create the products you use! <BR> <BR>Apologize to the list for the rant!</div>
