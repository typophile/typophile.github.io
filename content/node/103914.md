  a usable display font.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't any real inspiration or plan to start
  this project, it just kind of happened then took momentum once I created a few letters.
  If I had to describe it I would say it is angular but also subtle at the same time
  if that makes sense :). Any advice would be welcome and I know all the terms used
  involving type. The angular 'crossbars' seem to be working but I've been looking
  at these letters for so long I can't decide what works and what doesn't anymore.
  \r\n\r\nI've decided to create only the upper case to see if it is well received
  then if I feel it has room to grow I will create the lower case, numbers and maybe
  other versions of the 'Desperation' type face.\r\n\r\nBe as hard as you want as
  I've worked on this too long for it to contain any glitches.\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  and love this forum, it has provided many hours of reading.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/desperation_4274.jpg]"

  body: "I like the concept and it's carried through pretty well. \r\nTop terminal
    of /C/ comes down too far. \r\nI wonder if there's a different structure of /S/
    that might fit the concept better - maybe something with a spine that straightens
    out for a stretch, diagonally. \r\nThe breaks from straights to curves are always
    a tough thing for me: if they adhere too much to simple geometry (e.g. a semicircle
    arc attached directly to a straight stem) the transition can look not smooth enough,
    as I think is the case here. So you get, for example, four little \"corners\"
    in the joining parts of the counter of /O/. \r\nOn /M/W/ (and /N/?) it might be
    worth trying the traditional thin-upstrokes/thick-downstrokes alternating pattern
    instead of keeping the verticals thickest as you have."

  body: "Thanks to the both of you for your quick replies, it is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n@eliason
    the point about the curves and simple geometry shapes is something that definitely
    needs to be worked on, something I think is going to take a lot of playing around
    with. At the same time though it is something I'm going to have to do at some
    point as the lowercase font will no doubt contain a lot more curves.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the M, N, W were the 3 letters that caused me the most hassle so yeah, I 100%
    they need working on.\r\n\r\n@hrant The reason the small protrusions are still
    in this type face is due to the fact they were the first elements introduced to
    the designs and have just been carried through to the later designs. I think I
    was afraid the original designs would get lost if they were removed but I have
    realised the font can carry itself with other angular elements. They do look a
    bit awkward now and I may need to take a closer look to what the font will look
    like without them. \r\n\r\nI'll update you with the changes when done."

  body: "Again thanks for the advice, from your comments I have made the following
    changes.\r\n\r\nCurves blend in more with the stems. This has been achieved by
    opening up the width of letters with rounded bodies. It gives the whole font a
    more natural feel and less geometric IMO.\r\n\r\nThe angles of the cross bars
    \ have been reduced to give them a more subtle feel.\r\n\r\nThe 'M' 'N' 'W' have
    been balanced out.\r\n\r\nThe 'Z' have become more pointed to blend in better
    with the rest of the font.\r\n\r\nThe crossbar of the 'S' has more of an angle.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    the protrusions have been removed as they weren't really needed anymore due to
    the fact the other angular elements help to carry this font forward. \r\n\r\nDoes
    everyone feel I'm moving in the right direction with this from the first designs?\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "I like the slanted terminals. But overall, it all feels rather stiff. The
    angles are trying to be playful, but the overall structures are still rather rigid.\r\n\r\nSo
    maybe have all the glyphs stand up and 'shake it out' and loosen up a bit. See
    what happens. "

  body: "That Z is good.\r\nI kinda miss the protrusions - is this now overnormalized?\r\nStraight-curve
    transitions are definitely improved.\r\nAnother option to consider for /N/M/W/
    is rounded humps rather than angles (i.e. a more lowercase form for N, like an
    upside down U with a corner top left). "

  body: "@hrant haha, I would like to call it something a bit more vulgar at this
    moment. It is really frustrating. I take my hat off to designers who create fonts
    that work.\r\n\r\n@eliason yeah, I was thinking it was a bit normal now. I think
    I'm going to creat a set with and without the protrusions. See what people think.
    In my original drawings on graph paper I had the M an W rounded but quickly discarded
    that idea, maybe I should of spent a bit more time working on them. Ill have a
    play around with that again I think.\r\n\r\n@aluminium, if you think it is stiff
    now you should of seen my first drafts on graph paper, I was using a ruler and
    compass to create the letter forms. In general the kind of work I create it is
    thought out and planned with measurements and everything, I'm finding it hard
    to be a bit loose at the minute but I think once I get to a stage, with a few
    of the letters, I feel comfortable with I think it should all click into place.
    Hopefully :-/\r\n\r\nI'll keep you all updated once I've made changes. \r\n\r\nMany
    thanks\r\n\r\nDarren"

  body: "Hi again\r\n\r\nMore changes to 'desperation' to share\r\n\r\nI've tried
    not to be too cute with the angles of the crossbars. I've pretty much copied and
    pasted elements together to make them work and luckily I feel it has unified the
    uppercase together.\r\n\r\nI've slightly changed the thickness of the strokes
    to make it feel lighter. This also made the angles more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe
    'M' and the 'W' are probably the biggest changes I've made.\r\n\r\nI'm now in
    the process of creating a lowercase and numbers.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what
    you think.\r\n\r\nMany many many thanks\r\n\r\nDarren\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0etyiu21h6q5hq/FONT.pdf\">desperation.pdf</a>"
