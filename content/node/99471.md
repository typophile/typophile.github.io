  Stories\" in particular, but is the \"Donald Barthelme\" the same font or different?\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sixty_3599.jpg]"

  body: "I wonder if this was drawn with a calligraphy pen rather than typeset. There
    are clear differences in the letters (S, t, i) in \"Sixty Stories\".   \r\n\r\nWikipedia
    says it was published in 1981."

  body: I think you might be right.  I am impressed with the serifs though, for caligraphy.
