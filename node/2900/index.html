  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">okay, so i broke down &#40;in a moment of weakness&#41; and bought the full version of font lab the other day. i&#39;ve been having fun playing with it, but i came across a couple things that kinda bother me. maybe someone out there can help me with a couple questions. <BR>first - and most annoyingly, i had been using the demo version 4.5 and importing eps files that i had made with adobe streamline, but it seems that 4.6 doesn&#39;t support the streamline files. i keep getting an error message about the eps file when i try to import it. works fine in the 4.5 demo, but won&#39;t work in 4.6 - wassup with that? <BR>second - <BR>i&#39;ve been fooling around with the opentype features and tried to fix it so that when one types 1/4  &#40;one slash four&#41; you get the apropriate fraction substitution. however in previewing this feature in fontlab, the first slash doesn&#39;t show up when i type it &#40;oh wait i think i just answered my own question&#41; but lemme see if i&#39;m right - okay fontlab uses slashes to separate glyphs when previewing, so i have to type 1//4 to get onefourth. is this just because the program thinks i&#39;m going to enter something like 1/0145/4 where 0145= some character that isn&#39;t accessible by the regular keyboard? anyhow my main concern is will this be a problem when i export the font in otf format? will i still have to type 1//4 in other applications to get the fraction to work properly? <BR>oh and one more thing - i&#39;ve figgered out how to expoert postscript flavored otf fonts, but can&#39;t quite figger out how to export ttf flavored otf fonts. i mean i can&#39;t tell if my opentype insturictions are being exported when i generate the font in ttf format only because the files i generate aren&#39;t being marked with the opentype icon &#40;like other fonts that i&#39;m running in windows xp&#41; so i&#39;m slightly confused about that too. anyhow, any help would be appreciated. thnx for reading!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Streamline EPS files. Have you considered contacting FontLab Support? There is a problem report form at <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html</a> that you could fill, attaching the EPS files that trouble you.  <BR>2. No need to worry. The slash character works as an &#34;escape character&#34; only within FontLab. You can type /glyphname or &#92;unicode -- these are useful ways of previewing glyph that normally aren&#39;t mapped to the keyboard, or even don&#39;t have Unicode indexes.  <BR>3. Download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx</a> -- it&#39;ll let you check what OpenType layout features are included in a fonts.  <BR>In order to get an &#34;O&#34; icon instead of a &#34;TT&#34; icon in OpenType TT fonts, the fonts must be digitally signed.

		<div class="commentbody">adam yer a genius! have you actually gone through the process to be able to sign your own files digitaly? if so, what &#34;certificate authority&#39; did you go with and how do you find those services? <BR>on a more personal note, i noticed that you&#39;ve had some experience with cyrillic fonts... what&#39;s your conection there? do you speak any slavic languages &#40;i&#39;m guessing Polish at least&#41; iv&#39;e been messing around for a while extending character sets for fonts to include cyrillic characters, mostly display faces simply because i&#39;m a slavophile myself &#40;i almost majored in russian&#41; and like to have cool fonts to correspond with my fellow russian speakers. are there any books readily available on cyrillic design standards? or is that going to be another big hunt for me? thnx for your help!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul,  <BR> <BR>1. Setting everything up for digital font signing is tedious, I agree. But I am able to sign my fonts. I have provided some links about signing OpenType fonts at <a href="http://topica.com/lists/opentype/read/message.html?mid=1713339467" target="_blank">http://topica.com/lists/opentype/read/message.html?mid=1713339467</a>  <BR> <BR>Oh, I forgot. Rather than signing your fonts, you can also change the file extension from .ttf to .otf. In fact, &#34;.otf&#34; can be used for both OpenType PS &#40;CFF&#41; and OpenType TT fonts, but is recognized only on Windows 2000/XP, while &#34;.ttf&#34; can be used only for OpenType TT fonts.  <BR> <BR>2. I speak Polish &#40;native&#41; and Russian &#40;but it&#39;s my fourth language, after German and English, so it&#39;s not really good&#41;. I learned how to read Latin letters at the age of 3, and started reading Russian at the age of 6, so I tell myself that I developed a certain feeling for the Cyrillic script. I&#39;m by no means an expert and wouldn&#39;t dare design anything myself, but every time I see Cyrillic letters and have a feeling that there is something wrong with them, this feeling is confirmed by my fellow experts. But I&#39;d suggest you talk to them rather than myself. There was an extensive discussion on Cyrillic design here at Typophile and I provided a set of basic literature: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/12232.html" target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/12232.html</a>  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">am i responsible for this numbering trend? or is that just you? ;^&#41; i&#39;m quite certain that i&#39;m not as familiar with cyrillic letters as are you, but i love em. are there any cyrillic black letter fonts out there? has that been done do you know? and polish is on my list of languages to learn along with hindi. languages just fascinate me! i tried signing up for your list on topica, but kept getting error messages. guess i&#39;m technochallenged today. anyhow... thnx for all the great resources! someday i&#39;ll be as smart!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maxim Zhukov &#40;until recently typographic advisor to the UN&#41; and I drafted some ideas for Cyrillic design standards a few years ago, but neither of us has found time to work on it. Perhaps now that Maxim&#39;s duties at the UN are over, he at least might get back to it. Maxim has reviewed all my Cyrillic designs for the past six years.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">okay now this post doesn&#39;t refer to any quirks, but i thought i&#39;d just tack this on to my current post. so here it goes... i am imensly interested in opentype and opentype capabilities and have have had some fun with some of the more basic stuff in FontLab &#40;like simple ligature subtitution&#41; but is there any text, manual, or other comprehensive set of instructions that breaks down how to program features into opentype? i&#39;ve been going through the fontlab manual and maybe i&#39;m just missing some things and need to go through it again... but i&#39;m also interested in learning how i can input lookups that aren&#39;t supported by FontLab at this time &#40;such as contextual and positioning lookups&#41; is there any way to do this? better yet.. anyone know of a font designing tutorial for dummies? anyhow, thnx for reading.</div>
