  been bugging me for some time. So I&#39;m throwing this out to the <i>other</i>
  expert spotters here. &#40;First time for everything.&#41; <BR> <BR>These were grabbed
  from the movie <i>Ed Wood</i> &#40;1994&#41;. This is the best I can do until the
  DVD is released &#40;delayed multiple times already--I guess they&#39;re holding
  out for Martin Landau to do a comment track or something&#41;: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55474.jpg"
  alt="edwood"> <BR> <BR>The script is easy--Dom Diagonal slanted a bit more, but
  the condensed sans serif is what&#39;s driving me nuts. When Binderstyle came up
  this last week I thought that might be it, but no. There&#39;s one in the Solotype
  catalog that looks close called Glenlake Gothic, but it doesn&#39;t quite seem to
  match the lowercase you can see in Wood&#39;s sad bio at the bottom. <BR> <BR>Any
  ideas?'

  body: Thanks, James! <BR> <BR>Now that I can see it better, it does indeed have
    a lot in common with Binderstyle, but differs as well in significant ways. The
    unusual symetrical lowercase y and the lowercase g fit Binderstyle. The cap R
    and the lowercase t and f don&#39;t. Overall it&#39;s very Binderstyle-like, though.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking now that it might be a modified version of Binderstyle.
    Hmmm.

    shorter and, in the larger titles, it is bolder and less condensed.'
