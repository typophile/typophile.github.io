  body: "The closest match I can find is the \"CgChic\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eaglefonts.com/cgchic-ttf-12644.htm\r\n\r\n...but
    all lines of CgChic are more square \r\nand the horizontal line of \"A\" is straight
    vs the curly one in your font.\r\nI hope that CgChic will give you some idea to
    find your font.\r\n\r\nI used our application \"Find my Font\" (http://www.findmyfont.com)\r\nto
    search for similar fonts using the image you provided.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n"
