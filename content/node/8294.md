body: I am new to the study of Typography and I have a couple of questions for the
  learned. <BR> <BR>First, is there a term for groups of letters that share commonalities,
  such as o, e, c, d, q, etc.? <BR> <BR>Second, if someone can make some recommendations
  as to posts regarding really good technical guides to Typography, as I am sure the
  topic has been covered previously?
