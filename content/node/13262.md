    an x-height read down into the deep chasm of a space before I hit the smooth slide
    across an em dash just to face another deep drop before I continue.  \r\n\r\nEach
    font reacts differently, so resolve comes individually for me.\r\nSDK\r\nSusan

  body: "While at some level it is a matter of personal preference -- there are some
    common conventions that one violates at considerable risk. The British, for example,
    use a word-spaced en dash for the dash that signals a break in the thought within
    a sentence. In the States, a closed-up em dash is usually used for this purpose
    -- see, for example, the CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we
    typically use a dash 3/4ths of an em long centered in an em space (a dash of 750
    units with left & right sidebeaings of 125 units with a 1,000 unit em) for the
    \"em\" dash. With really condensed fonts, I'll make the dash *about* the width
    of a capital M, and the sidebearings won't be 125 units. I've done this for over
    10 years now, & no publisher has yet complained.\r\n\r\nWith en dashes -- usually
    used with numbers -- I'll usually make up 2 dashes, one to center up (vertically)
    with uppercase (lining) figures, and one to better center up with lower-case (oldstyle)
    numbers. Usually only one em dash, though. I suppose one could make a  slightly
    higher dash for capitals with OpenType fonts, just as one makes up extra parens
    & brackets for full capitals."

  body: Not that it's particularly relevant but, in the olden days when setting type
    meant staring at a stunning amber (or green) screen full of monospaced characters
    and trying to keep a mental picture of where you were on the page, we used to
    insert a thin nonbreaking space to the left, and a thin regular space to the right
    of an em dash. The rationale was that if the line had to break in the vicinity
    of the dash, it would do so after, rather than before the dash, or--if there were
    no spaces at all--carry the dash and the words either side of it to the next line,
    which sometimes made for excessive white space. Nowadays you can actually see
    what you're doing, so it may be a moot point, but we old-timers are inclined to
    spin yarns about the days of yesteryear at the least provocation.

  body: I am definitely a space-around-long-dashes guy. An em dash bumping straight
    into adjacent letters is very distracting. Of course, a lot of American conventions
    are -- like placing end quotes after the period even though the clause within
    the quotes is "not a complete sentence."

  body: "CMS rules are rather strict: no spaces around any dash.  For what, you ask?
    \ My Chicago-born copyediting girlfriend says it saves space.  Very Midwesternly
    efficient... and stuffy if you ask me.\r\n\r\nI've held the University of Chicago
    in contempt for far greater impositions, such as exporting their faculty to the
    Art Institute of Chicago to suck the life out of foreign cinema courses.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a half-space kinda guy for emdashes in text settings.  I've taken to setting my
    sidebearings for such a preference when desgining my typefaces.  Just my way of
    getting back at U of C, I guess.\r\n\r\nRaising the endash between lining numerals
    is a valuable lesson as well.  Thanks for advocating that one, Charles.  With
    Opentype, such automatic adjustments are easily within reach."

  body: This used to be solved by the inclusion of 2 em dashes. There was the regular
    one, a full em dash on the em width, and what Merg. called a 3/4 em dash, full
    em width, but the dash was only 3/4 of the em with essentailly a thin built-in
    on either side. I think most Em dashes today are actually the old 3/4, and the
    authentic em is dropped.
