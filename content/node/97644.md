  body: "Looks like a custom job to me and, having a closer look to the tagline, I
    would probably start with some extended grotesk and customize/recreate some letters:
    extend /V point, circle for /O, /R \"\xE0-la-Avant-Garde\", possibly lowering
    /A middle bar.\r\nSome possible fonts to customize, more or less work: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/|Akzidenz
