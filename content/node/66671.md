  I hope it isn't a CR custom typeface. If it is, can anyone recommend anything like
  it? It's quite urgent!\r\n\r\nThank you \r\nKate"

    would be on ITC Garamond. (Maybe that will do for you.) Unfortunately your photo
    shows way too little detail to definitely make out such a standard text font.
