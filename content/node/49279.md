body: "Hi all, wanted to post what I think is the final mark for a jewelry designer
  I'm working with. Her studio is called Aubrey Ellen, she creates handmade pieces
  from semi-precious and precious stones and is looking at moving into doing custom
  design for bridal parties. \r\n\r\nI explored tons of different directions and this
  is the final iteration of my script-y explorations, which are very much [b]not[/b]
  my strong suit. I tried a variety of hand-lettered forms, none of which had the
  refinement needed, and then started looking for typefaces that had some of the forms
  I was looking for. The working name is Aubrey Ellen, this is a slight reworking
  and connection of a font called Jeffriana into a sort of A and e ligature. Very
  open to any feedback you have, as well as ideas for a typeface to pair with this
  for the name (which I think will be Aubrey Ellen Fine Jewelry, still finalizing
  that). Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The curve that connects the A to the e isn't consistent. And overall, I see
    more of (weird loop) fe than Ae. Maybe if the e were raised a bit so that it fit
    nicely into the white space between the top and bottom loops on the A? Other than
    that, I like.

  body: "I think the bottom-right loop on the 'A' should loop back into it's crossbar
    smoothly. This looks off to me right now as I like the way the whole 'A' is one,
    almost symmetrical stroke.\r\nThe 'e' is a bit small for the 'A'. It would seem
    by looking at the name, Aubrey Ellen, that Ellen should have as much emphasis,
    so I would make the 'e' much bigger."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys. This was my rough attempt just sort of laying
    the forms over each other, I'm breaking apart the typeface now and working on
    getting the lines to flow better and I'll definitely take your comments into account.\r\n\r\njayyy,
    I've gone back and forth on the a/e relationship, I'll try some options and see
    what may work. Appreciate the crit.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks guys. Paul, I played with the ligature idea but felt like there were
    a lot of AE logos out there I wanted to clearly differentiate from. Every sketch
    in that vein I did was met with \"it looks like American Eagle\" even though it
    really bore very little resemblance. I explored the ambigram a bit as well but
    hand-rendered type is very much not my strong suit, didn't get anything very successful
    out of it.\r\n\r\nI'm working on this while I have power before the hurricane
    hits, so I'll check back in when I can :)"

    that that you're doing... i think it isnt correct... i would take more attention
    to that like... doing that with just \"one\" stroke, with the pencil always on
    the paper.\r\ni dont know the english expression to this...\r\n\r\nJoel Santos

  body: "The mark of Adobe Acrobat comes immediately to mind when I look at this solution.
    And I would add that that the studio\u2019s name must be used in full, unless
    this is just one half of the final trademark. If it is, let's see both word and
    mark together."

  body: "Ok, I'm alive with things more or less intact, have power back and no real
    damage. It's been a bit of a crazy week to say the least.\r\n\r\nJoel, if I get
    what you're saying you want it to be one continuous stroke? I don't disagree,
    I'm working on that with the (hopefully) final version).\r\n\r\nJoshua, I've noticed
    the resemblance as well but I don't think I'm worried as it's a totally different
    application and really a fairly abstract form to start with. I do realize the
    type is a major part of the identity but wanted to develop the mark first before
    letting the type influence it. I am looking to see how i'd like to use the name
    with it and hope to have some ideas with that in the next day or two. Thanks for
    the feedback.\r\n"

  body: "Yes... i had a project sometime ago that faced mostly the same problems the
    solution i found was to pick up a marker and put a white paper (a2 size) on the
    table and just with arm half stretched draw everything in one stroke...\r\nthe
    best way for you to accomplish that and see how it works is to draw and get out
    of the computer...\r\nmy opinion of course...\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // yrmk . visual"

    layout of zevbiz's would be slick.
