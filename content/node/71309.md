body: Does anyone know of any women type designers prior to Bertha Goudy 1869-1935
  or Elizabeth Friedlander 1903-1984 or can you point me to a source? If you don't
  know specific names do you have any literature that mentions women designing type?
  (I know they were compositors and sometimes printers and type finishers, I am looking
  for the earliest woman who designed type). Thanks.

    1912 for the Typefoundry Julius Klinkhardt in Leipzig, Germany (later the Foundry
    was aquired by the H. Berthold AG). '

    heard of before.It was very helpful.\r\n\r\nIn digging further I have found the
    name of Elisha Pechey .. designer of several faces for Stephenson Blake...her
    first font dating from the 1860's. I was able to find her as part of an online
    listing of the fonts by that foundry.\r\nDo you know of other online listings
    of early foundries? or suggestions of a place that holds a library of old specimen
    books I could peruse for other names? Thank you.\r\n\r\n "

    as Elisha at my first source, but I now see it as you wrote, Eleisha on another,
    and there seems to be plenty about that person in Roy Millington's book about
    the foundry.\r\nSo for now the record goes back to Hildegard ... "

    Mosley</a> and Johanna Drucker if they know of earlier women type designers.

    could you please name it? Thank you for your help.

    and were given a special tour and lecture and got to see hundreds of drawings.
    It was a great experience.

    for research, but they are not on display or generally available to the public.
    \r\n\r\nThere are literally tens of thousands of drawings, and searching all of
    them for female employees will be tedious and time-consuming, if that becomes
    your goal. (Some of the signatures are not so easy to decipher, nor to tell gender.)\r\n\r\nBut
    here, for example, you can see that Dorothy Arbogast did the drawing for the 12-pt
