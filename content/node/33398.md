    I think the saturated, high-contrast photography style really suits the subject.\r\n\r\nReminds
    me of a very pleasant afternoon I spent photographing old signs in Salt Lake City...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slc_sign_5873.jpg]"

    as well? Two of your stated aims are documenting and appreciating vernacular typography;
    I feel like these aims would be better handled by photographs that are not shot
    at angles with parts of the featured words and letters cropped out."

    will work up the steam to push this project out to potential publishers. For now
    I am simply happy to have it online. Do you know of any publishers who would be
    predisposed to this sort of publication?\r\n\r\njpad: I do have other photographs
    that often show the signs in their entirety. However it was/is my intention with
    this project to really focus on using the camera as a compositional tool while
    examining the unique letterforms and weathering of each sign. I guess in some
    ways I do not see the documentation, appreciation, and recontextualization as
    three separate things, but as a single goal\u2014each component of which is essential
    to the other. Hopefully that makes sense. \r\n\r\nEssentially I wanted, personally,
    to admire these letterforms as something a little removed from their original
    intent. The camera was my way of doing that. Hence the 'arty' compositions of
    these images."

  body: "I'd also like to see whole letters and signs. I think the audience here is
    different from the average layperson or photographer: whatever the medium, I am
    interested in the letterforms first and foremost. So these fragments are frustrating
    for me, especially knowing there is more. For that matter, you could bring these
    same images, or other photos of the same signs, to an even more abstract level
    than you have. Why leave them recognizable as letters, or even as signs?\r\n\r\n\"I
    do not see the documentation, appreciation, and recontextualization as three separate
    things, but as a single goal\u2014each component of which is essential to the
    other.\"\r\n\r\nI would argue with that. Document: record. Appreciate: view, assess.
    Recontextualize: obscure, dislodge, reframe, repurpose. One of these is not like
    the others. It may be that your goal for this project is all three, and of course
    I can't argue with that. But this audience may value the originals more than the
    recontextualizations."

  body: "crossgrove,\r\n\r\nthanks for the insightful comments.\r\n\r\nyou may very
    well be right\u2014it may be an issue of audience. I can indeed understand why
    these photographs may frustrate those looking for full specimens. But the aim
    here is to appreciate the micro (as opposed to macro) properties of the letterforms
    by focusing on the presence of nature and the human hand and not so much the content
    of the sign itself. This is the reason that the letters are not completely abstracted.\r\n\r\nTo
    this end the \"document, appreciate, and recontuxtualize\" components are not
    the same things, but equal parts of an inseperable process. if i had stripped
    the recontextualize portion from this process we would probably be seeing the
    full sign. However for me the crop and composition play an essential role in allowing
    the viewer (typographer or otherwise) to appreciate the work on a formal/sensory
    level."

  body: I have never been to most of those places. I do not work with trains, or hand
    paint exteriors with scriptures. TO be fair, I considered the term "document"
    lightly on the front of the site, but the pictures document well other things,
    such as  the chemistry of the decomposition, quite well. Brad's recontextualization
    (as pretty art stuff)is what creates the value to some of us, as too busy adults,
    to go and appreciate. It also helps keep me from reading the words in what is
    a picture, to some extent. Could there be more type-documentation and less recontexting?
    Sure, but this works well for me. Also, ya can't beat the price.

  body: I think any publisher of typography/graphic design/photography books would
    be potentially interested. I've seen a book once similar to your project but it
    was presented in an alphabetic way (for each letter there was one photograph &
    some text about where it was taken & what was special about it). I'll look it
    up for you if you like & I can also make a (small) list of publishers from books
    I own.

    about showing complete pictures instead of details, at least for this audience,

  body: "Just a quick note to say I just returned from my childhood home of New Orleans
    and managed to take some photos along the way. The new photos can be seen in the
    'Latest Additions' album\u2014you will notice I am now making a conscious effort
    to take 2 shots (sometimes more) to satisfy those wishing to see the whole sign
    as well as those drawn to the more abstracted crops.\r\n\r\nSome of the signs
    in the Newest Additions gallery are the same signs I have photographed before,
    but I can never resist an opportunity to perhaps look at these in a new way.\r\n\r\nTrips
    to Chicago and Seattle are planned within the next month, so I should have more
    to add to the site then.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the kind words and suggestions.
    The overall response has been quite positive and has given me a new energy for
    this project. I am still far away from pushing for book publication, but I do
    have a few ideas of how I would like to see lettermade grow in the future.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBrad."
