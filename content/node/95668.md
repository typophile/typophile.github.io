  hand lettered headlines you used to get in the advertisements of the period \u2013
  \u201CWe bought an Edsel\u201D etc.  I suppose in those days the availability of
  fonts (the original hot metal variety) must have been severely limited by today\u2019s
  standards, and lot of those headlines simply had to be hand-lettered by an in-house
  studio artist.\r\n\r\nAttached is my attempt to recapture the spontaneous joy of
  those Fifties faces.  It is a font.  It\u2019s called Bebopalula.  And if you\u2019re
  interested it\u2019s available from studio-k at myfonts.com  But whaddya think \u2013
  do you dig it, Daddy-O?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fifties Style_4568.png]"
