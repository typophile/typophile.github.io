body: Has anyone used Modern MT Condensed on news print? I&#39;m getting questioned
  by the visibilty of it in print... &amp; I feel, It should work fine... &#40;They
  suggested we use Helvetica D<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. But it doesn&#39;t compliment the logo nor the design/layout.

  body: why dont you check out the fonts at font bureau. they have a section deducated
    to fonts that are ideal for newsprint. Don&#39;t use helvetica, in my opinion
    it&#39;s overused. <BR> <BR>IM
