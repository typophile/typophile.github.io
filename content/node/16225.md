body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, or even if I'm doing
  anything wrong. I'm using TypeTool2 on Mac OSX. I've created a new font, and I want
  to define a glyph for Unicode 0x0141 (L with Slash). The array of export options
  is a bit bewildering to me, but what I've used is:\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIn the Font
  window: \r\n\r\nTitle: Unicode\r\nMode: Codepages\r\nCodepage: MacOS Roman\r\n\r\nWhen
  I Generate Font:\r\n\r\nPC True Type\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\nType 1 Export Options (I
  guess these don't matter):\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Make PFM file\r\n  <li>Make AFM and
  INF files\r\n  <li>Encoding options: Select encoding automatically\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTrue
  Type Export Options:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Export hinted TrueType fonts\r\n  <li>Keep
  existing TrueType instructions\r\n  <li>Export visual TrueType hints\r\n  <li>Autohint
  unhinted glyphs\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThen I go ahead and install the generated font.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is, I have a file which contains a single \\u0141 character. When I open
  the file up in TextEdit, it shows up properly as L with Slash in the default font
  (Monaco). However, when I change fonts to my font, the L with Slash remains exactly
  the same, and does not appear as in my font. All other letters (A-Z, etc) appear
  as they should in my font.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with the font? I defined \\u0141,
  so why isn't it being used?\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n--Rob\r\n\r\n
  \ \r\n"
