    that my attempt of the ten is clear, if you don\u2019t know, that it is a ten.
    I did know that before. But eleven? The idea behind of it is, that nothing remains
    nothing. The arrow above nothing means \"There is nothing.\", while the figure
    zero means \"I am something, but I mean nothing.\" I always was in the opinion,
    that the zero is the most fascinating number. In nature nothing does not exist.
    Otherwise it would be a violation of the uncertainty principle. The maximum of
    nothing is \"almost nothing\". Nothing is bursting the human mind in the same
    way as infinity.\r\n\r\nIn this way (my contribution) I could describe numbers
    on an endless number line. All zeros after the ten would not have an arrow above."

    is called that instead of, say, 'nothingness'?</cite>\r\n\r\nI just saw your question.
    I am not a physicist, but singularities (in black holes with a wide event horizon)
    seem to be very stable in contradiction to virtual particles in the vacuum. So
    the gravitation field gives evidence of the existence of something. On the other
    side you could ask, how real those things are, that we can\u2019t see, and whether
    the universe exists, if nobody is there, who observes it. (Not only singularities,
    but everything, that is only for moments in our consciousness or that is pure
    theory. This consideration gives room for speculations about the possibility of
    a simulation of that, which we call reality, because the simulation only had to
    take into account the content of your or my consciousness \u2013 even not the
    contents of the consciousness of all humans, because every human individual only
    sees cuttings of some other individuals \u2013 temporarily. Otherwise the computer
    [in a wide sense of that term], which would be required for the simulation, would
    require more interactions between particles in every moment, than particles exist
    in the universe.) That\u2019s the main reason, for which I hope, that the mankind
    survives or becomes replaced by another terrestrial species in the course of the
    biologic evolution or the evolution of a synthetical intelligence, that was developed
    by a biologic terrestrial species. There are millions of people, who believe in
    the existence of extraterrestrial life, although it is absolutely unevident, that
    it exists. (I only believe in nature, but not in Gods or substitutes of Gods.
    On the other side zero or infinity make it almost impossible, to believe in nothing.)
    But if we are the only creatures in universe, our self destruction would eliminate
    the only observer of the universe. And then the universe would be the most conceivable
    waste of beauty."

  body: I thought a singularity was when the gravitation of an object had compressed
    it to the ultimate density at which point it was ripe for explosion and its particles,
    once again, in a search for entropy.

  body: "@ Chris\r\n\r\nAs I said, I am not a physicist, but in the theory (probably
    there is more than one theory), there is a singularity in every black hole. If
    Hawking is right, then black holes irradiate and loose energy/mass. As smaller
    the hole, as more energy/mass it looses through emission. And in the end it explodes.
    But when it explodes, its mass is almost zero. That is odd, because if you believe
    in the big bang, it has started with a singularity (with the mass of the universe).
    With regard to the time and the stability the big bang singularity is probably
    an exception from our point of view, because there was nothing outside that singularity
    \u2013 the big bang singularity was the only possible point of view \u2013 and
    therefore there was nobody, who was able to compare the lifetime of that singularity
    with any processes. There was no relation to anything, because the big bang singularity
    was everything. You could not say, how long the big bang singularity has existed,
    before it has exploded.\r\n\r\nHowever, the zero is fascinating. (There is an
    ingenious idea about full and empty zeros in the beginning of the book <em>Picnic
    at the Way Side</em> by the brothers Strugatzki. Really ingenious.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a book with short stories about singularities, which I likewise can recommend,
    but I don\u2019t know, if it was translated into English: <em>Singularities</em>
    by Peter Schattschneider.)"

    into one singularity and that singularity has the sum of all gravitational forces
    acting on it, if there is no more \"space\" for compression, that force must cause
    explosion--starting the cycle again until all things become yet another singularity."

  body: "@ Chris\r\n\r\nAs far as I have understood, singularities have no volume,
    independed from their mass. And their own mass compresses them. But let\u2019s
    assume, time does not end for the case, that the universe ends in a singularity
    again and that there is an observer of the singularity with our feeling of time.
    Then it may exist for billions of billions of billions of billions of billions
    of years, until something happens, that brings it to explosion. But because there
    is no observer, it would not matter, if it directly after compression explodes.
    There does not seem to be a difference between infinity and zero with regard to
    the time in case of the big bang singularity."

  body: Hmmm, I guess I have always thought singularities or at least the "big" one
    had consumed all energy and mass, therefore there was none left outside of it
    and that the only "force" remaining was its own gravitation which was relentless
    and would continue beyond ultimate mass causing ultimate explosion? Then again,
    I am old, forgetful, naive, a romantic, and definitely NOT a physicist :-)
