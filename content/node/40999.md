  thanks--I'm a novice font fanatic."

    help you on this one.\r\nWhere is this from (how old is it)?\r\nCould it be pre-digital?
    It could be hand-drawn as well.\r\n\r\nI suggest you post font ID requests on
    the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">Type ID Board</a> so all of the
    other experts get their chance and your chances to get this identified get much
    better.\r\n\r\n\r\nJan"

  body: "\r\n\r\nThanks to the 2 experts who concur that this was probably hand-lettered.
    \ It is from the original movie poster for the Wizard of Oz, which is a 1939 movie.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    thanks for educating me on a \"ligature.\" "
