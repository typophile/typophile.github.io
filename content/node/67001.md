  body: Isn't this some kind of a Futura Bold with a flipped V used for A? The G and
    C are a bit different, though.

  body: "The G and C look like (almost) Novel Gothic (A.k.a. [[http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm|Nimrod]]
    in QBF version). Some letters do look like a heavy Futura, maybe with extra stroke.
    I also thought of Berthold Block. \r\n\r\nI guess the point is that this seems
    like a mix of fonts, some with edited glyphs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
