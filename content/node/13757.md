  website is an eternally evolving not-for-profit typography project founded by [[David
  John Earls]] in 1999. Its original incarnation was in a magazine format, covering
  interviews, software reviews and tutorials from a range of contributors. Later,
  it turned into a typography news website that prided itself on the speed of updates
  -- back then the website was being updated on a nearly daily basis. During its third
  and current fourth phase, it is a collaborative project between David and [[Yves
  Peters]] -- David providing recent typography news with commentary, and Yves writing
  comprehensive reviews of the cream of recent typeface releases.\r\n\r\nOne of the
  founding principles of the website is that it should provide fiercely independent
  voices within the typographic community. The site does this by not deviating from
  its foundations of honesty, impartiality and independence of funding. The website
  accepts no sponsorship or commercial advertising, instead choosing to always cuts
  its cloth accordingly and remain small. As such we intend never be constrained or
  co-opted by commercial pressures."
