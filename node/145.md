  body: You can get something in a similar mood with Lineto, but  <BR>their fonts
    seems to be quite expensive &#40;or not?&#41;. Links to  <BR>Albroni, and of course,
    Le Corbusier. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lineto.com/content.html?ID=109&amp;dir_id=66"

  body: Eduardo, <BR>I&#39;m am not digitalizing the letters. Marcelinho , a friend
    from fau, reconstructed the letters based on a photo for the logo of his studio,
    named &#34;estudio 6&#34; and he asked me what font was that. <BR>It may be an
    interesting idea to digitalize it don`t you think? <BR>abs

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s a nice lettering, except for &#34;e&#34; and &#34;s&#34;, that
    seems  <BR>odd to me. I wouldn&#39;t attempt to make an exact revival of  <BR>that,
    but it is inspiring indeed. :-&#41; <BR>
