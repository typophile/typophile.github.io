    the missing parts are all around? I don\u2019t get it but maybe you could fill
    me in?\r\n\r\nBut it reads \u2018typography\u2019 all right, that\u2019s nice."

  body: "I take the incomplete letters along with pieces of characters as a hint at
    the \"working\" type. This composition, to my eye, talks about craft of using
    type. I think the weakness of the design is that the bits of letters become to
    decorative. I think maybe the bits should look as though they have been set aside
    or as if they are not yet included in the artist's work but may soon be needed
    (like a palette of letter parts). \r\n\r\nReally that is how i work. I will key
    some type in illustrator, then tear it apart, deform it, whatever and then put
    it back together. During the process i keep all sorts of copies, different approaches,
    etc just laying around the artboard. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this cover could be a \"snapshot\"
    of the process of working with type."

  body: kinda cool but the letters look too unreasonably cut apart. It looks not random
    but neither does it look as if it was done purposefully. If you figured out a
    way to clean that up I think it would help a lot. Also I don't like how the pieces
    are all spread out. I would prefer them mixed togethar in a little group. Maybe
    like the E's on The Elements of Typographic Style.

  body: Nice work. That is to say - it works. Great! Do you think you will post more
    itterations or ideas? The feeling is a little out of date as far as type nuts
    are concerned but I bet it would sell just fine.

  body: "Thank you for all the comments. \r\n\r\nI suppose that calling this an ode
    to typography was slightly incorrect.  This was more of an experiment in typography
    for myself. There wasn't really an underlying theme except for the fact that this
    has to do with typography and it's 2006!  \r\n\r\nEach baseline is cut at alternate
    3 degree angles.  I like how on each line there's a sliver of the serif left behind
    to imply a delicate quality to the letterforms and at the other end the letter
    seems to be a  mix between serif and sans. \r\n\r\nThis was just a puzzle for
    me, and I have, in the past, had a hard time composing elements.  I figured the
    random shards of letterforms would make for nice abstract pieces of a puzzle to
    work with. \r\n\r\nI do suppose it is 'dated' feeling already, but I'm okay with
    that! Once I can make solid compositions, I will head for a more cutting edge
    feel in my layouts.\r\n\r\nThanks again for taking the time to critique my post."
