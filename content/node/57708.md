body: I found this poster on the net a long time ago. Now I'm working on a poster
  design of my own and this font would be perfect for it. Any help of identifying
  it would be greatly appreciated!

  body: I'm going to guess <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/bold/">Clarendon
    Bold</a>. Interestingly, the fl is done by smooshing the two letters together,
    and is not a true ligature. Odd for something ostensibly made by a designer.

  body: Thanks! I was surprised by the 'fl' too. Probably necessitated by space constraints.
    The descender of 'y' would clash if the 'f' was shifted leftward.
