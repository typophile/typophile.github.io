  look as nice as the helvetica which is used for major brands all over the world.
  Are these ripoffs or something? And if so where can I get the proper Helvetica from?\r\nI
  am so confused and can anyone give me a answer? "

    Bold, with rather tight (or very tight) tracking.\r\nThat\u2019s what you see

  body: Thank you very much for your help. To add to what you were saying about the
    film Helvetica.....I did a test on one of the posters used for the film and I
    am convinced the font used for it is Helvetica Neue. Helvetica Neue bold matches
    it but helvetica bold doesnt. Could this be right?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica-poster_4215.jpg]

    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/font_rend.php?idt=f&id=20744&rt=a&rs=388\">Neue

    is certainly the <em>Neue</em> variety. Historically, there were so many <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/font_rend.php?idt=f&id=19880&rt=a&rs=388\">Helvetica
    versions</a> developed, adjusted, customised, &c., for various typographic media
