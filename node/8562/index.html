<div class=commentbody>Damn! I have just signed this discussion list and I can't stand this = AtypI bull anymore. Although I am Brazilian - what, somehow, might as well be a synonym for "broken underpaid poor mofo" to some people- and, yes! I=B4m walking on = dire straits - I must say GET OVER IT, PEOPLE! If you can't reach AtypI, = build an association yourselves and work hard and try as much as you can to show = some good things and maybe, if you want that so &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; much, you might be invited to some conferece of theirs. &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;! This is typical. It's this hurt ego thing. "I was born in a &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; poor country, so, boo-hoo me, I have to make everybody feel sorry for me". = Well, I don't trade my Minas Gerais for anything in this world. <br> <br>It seems to me you point fingers at the people who took initiative and = blame them for being succesful, because you won't do it yourselves. Not = willing enough. Not quite ready for the real deal of sweat. "The ATypI is ready = so give me access. I don't want to do a thing." I'm damn sure that all it = takes to make difference is hard work. We don't go out and reach the world by weeping. <br> <br>Ramiro's letter is sure a valid thing but if it can't change a thing, = move on. There are other ways. <br> <br>So quit &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; weeping! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha, that would never work, at least not enough. <br>It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn't <i>rely</i> on it. <br> <br>Keith, the benefits of ATypI are in large part "intangible". For some people it's an obligation of sorts, and for a lot of people it's not a "sound investment": you become a member if you love type. And John is right, you should be thinking how <i>you</i> could help. <br> <br>One very tangible benefit of ATypI membership is being able to ask question on the discussion list: you'll possibly get an expert reply, and usually get some usable insight. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Hrant and John, I agree... I joined ATypI because I love type, and no one would choose to study type design because he/she wants to make tons of money. So, yes, I think the most important thing is the community that you get when you join an association like ATypI... <br> <br>BUT, with the internet, it might be just as easy to get support from other typographer/type designers... A good example is this board. I would still like to see tangible support and benefits, beause it is not cheap to join. I'm really not the kind who thinks about economic returns... it's just that I don't have a ton of money to spend. <br> <br>I'm more than happy to help... I would in fact like to get some local involvement for the next ATypI, and to involve myself. <br> <br>K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant said <br> <br>> It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn't rely on it. <br> <br>No, we certainly coudn't rely on it. But there is a new trend in collecting money for charitable purposes : the direct debit. You contribute a smallish sum of money every month without even noticing. It helps the organisation in question to plan ahead because they know in advance what's coming in. <br> <br>> the benefits of ATypI are in large part "intangible". <br> <br>I agree with this, but I think part of the problem is that new members come to ATypI with preconceived ideas of what these benefits are and can be very easily disappointed. I know that the fiasco with the book in Rome disappointed me but I've gotten over it and I'll live to fight another day. <br> <br>Matha <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha, the book situation was complex. Hey, I'm sure you remember the mental flowchart we were building while we were there! Your flight back was just too early, that's all... :-) BTW, I know somebody who made off with an entire <i>case</i> of the stuff, even though he had already gotten one (at least) for free. That's where I get pissed. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
