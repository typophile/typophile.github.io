  <BR>&#62;SAN FRANCISCO--Macromedia took center stage at the Flashforward2005 conference
  here Thursday morning to promise significant changes in its Flash animation software.  <BR>
  <BR>... Lynch also elicited ovations with a comparison of font clarity between Flash
  7 and 8,  <BR> <BR>Anyone there? What will this do to those who worked out how to
  make fonts that worked under previous Flash versions? Anyone know if Flash 8 will
  respect embedding permissions? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si
