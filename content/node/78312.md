body: "This is off one of a series of industrial information posters from the communist
  era in Hungary that I bought in Budapest a few years ago. (The other posters have
  different typefaces, ranging from Gill Sans to Helvetica and a few more more-or-less
  interesting ones I can't identify, might post them later if there's interest.) The
  text reads: \"do not touch the oxygen flasks with oily greasy hands\". Design in
  Hungary was good but tended to change less with the times, therefore the very wide
  time range.\r\n\r\nI've photographed, cropped, cleaned up and tried to straighten
  this as best I could, though it's still a bit warped. Whatthefont turns up nothing.
  Any ideas? Some of the letterforms are slightly awkward (especially the g) but overall
  I like it a lot."

  body: You're probably right - I've got some other ones I like in the same series
    that clearly are hand drawn, even some more professional-looking ones than this,
    and now that I look closely at it the individual lettershapes are subtly different.
    Pity. :)

  body: Mostly it's just curiosity, I wasn't really planning any applications. :)
    I'm too much of a poor student to be able to buy any commercial font I vaguely
    like anyway.

    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/dobra/black/|Dobra Black]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aruban/big-stuff/regular/|Big
    Stuff]], both of which would work great unless I was really after the squared-off
    look or something genuinely from the time."

  body: Here's the full-size poster in case anyone is interested, stains and pins
    intact. (It was cheap.) Not one of my favourites except for the type, the colours
    are a bit dull.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_9156_4640.jpg]
