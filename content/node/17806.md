body: "I came across some interesting type in an old magazine and was wondering if
  anyone knew what the names of these typefaces were. I know there are some members
  here to have a great eye for predigital type. I hoping they can help.   \r\n\r\nThe
  first one, \"Far-Out\", is a font that's been around for a while. There's a digital
  version on myfonts called <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/shazam/
  target=new>Shazam</a>. I want to know it's real name or what <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/shazam/
  target=new>Shazam</a> was based on. \r\n\r\nI have no clue on the second sans serif
  sample (insect).\r\n\r\nThe third sample is very akin to Pinewood, but not the same.
  Anyone know it's name.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the fourth sample is (super).\r\n\r\nThe
  five sample is also a \"woody\" typeface. I'm hoping someone know's its name. \r\n\r\nAs
  always, any help is appreciated. \r\n\r\n"

  body: The tree2 typeface was called Rustic and the super one was called Book Jacket
    (and may be found on CorelDraw CDs as Brochure).

  body: '"super" looks like Phil Martin''s work to me. Maybe "Bagatelle" but I''m
    not sure. http://mm2000s.net/BagatelleGraphic.jpg'

  body: "Phil's Bagatelle is derived from Book Jacket, a VGC face. Bagatelle had a
    lower x-height, more swashes, two weights (instead of one), and some differences
    in details.\r\n\r\nThe one that looks like planks is an old face called Astur.
    I'm sure I have seen a digital version by some other name, Lower East Side or
    something."

  body: Ah, yes - Astur. Two digital versions I'm aware of are <a href="http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/woodplank.html"
    target="_blank">Woodplank</a> by David Rakowski (who also made that Lower East
    Side font) and Buster by Brendel. Rakowski created all of his fonts for the Mac
    originally, so a version for that platform ought to be out there somewhere.

  body: Wow! What a wealth of information. Thanks, guys. I didn't think that Astur
    would have made it into the digital realm. I'm glad it did. There seems to be
    another digitization of Book Jacket floating around besides Brochure. It goes
    by its own name.

    Shazam which looks an awful lot like it. Does anyone know how to contact Mr. Alonzo? '
