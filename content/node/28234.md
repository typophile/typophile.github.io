body: "I have some basic open type (SC, Figs, etc) that work fine within FontLab.
  It compiles without error. It previews etc. When I go to generate an .OTF, it gives
  the following error:\r\n\r\n<i>ERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType
  font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for
  errors</i>\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me in a direction for this kind of error? How
  can I debug if the FL compiler isn't showing errors?  I know it's hard without posting
  the font, but any ideas would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRandy"

  body: "Hello,\r\nIf you have set the option \"Genrate OpenType [kern] feature if
    it is undefined or outdated\" on - the malicious feature code may be created during
    the generation of the font.\r\nTry the folowing: \"MetricWindow/KerningAssistance/Update[kern]feature\"
    then you have the code for the kern feature in the OpenType panel and you may
    get a helpfull error message when you try to compile.\r\nEigi"

  body: "Thanks everyone for your replies. It is now working. I think there were multiple
    problems :-) The main culprit I think were extra (nonsense) small cap accents
    that were generated by yours truely causing class issues. I also updated the kern
    feature for good measure (though I think I had done this before).\r\n\r\nDavid:
    couldn't find the fontlab.fea file from the thread. Turns out that wasn't the
    problem though. Thanks for the idea.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRandy"
