<p>GEOMATRIX
Type Innovations dynamic new geometric &ldquo;stencil&rdquo; sans font</p>
<p>Artist Statement 
I have been in the type design business for more than three decades. I started my career with Mergenthaler Linotype (aka Linotype-Hell) in 1976. I was fortunate to have worked with Matthew Carter, David Berlow and many other world-renowned type designers. It was a privilege to work with John Quaranta, a 30-year veteran designer who was my mentor, my colleague and my friend. In those early days, I worked with pen and pencil and used specially designed optical lens and cameras to modify and convert many ITC typefaces over to the &ldquo;Linotype Font Library&rdquo;. We also cut &ldquo;friskets&rdquo; from our hand drawn letters in the photographic conversion process to &ldquo;photo'&rdquo; and later for &ldquo;digital&rdquo; printing systems. Shortly thereafter, we utilized the &ldquo;Ikarus&rdquo; computer system to hand digitize and interpolate many new weights and typeface designs. And then, everything changed with &ldquo;Adobe PostScript&rdquo; and the new font technologies. I even worked closely with Apple on it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quickdraw GX&rdquo; multi-master font technologies which later became the &ldquo;OpenType&rdquo; font standard for both Mac and PC.</p>
<p>I have worked on many hundreds of different typeface designs during my career with Linotype. And I was fortunate to witness and partake in all the different stages of type development over the years. During the last ten years with Linotype, I worked exclusively on reviving the work of the American Type Designers including Dwiggin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Electra&rdquo; and Ruzicka&rsquo;s &ldquo;[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fairfield/|Fairfield]]. Expanding the styles, weights and functionality of many other designs as well.</p>
<p>After Linotype, I worked for a large advertising company, Bozell-Worldwide, known for their famous &ldquo;Got Milk&rdquo; ads. And later, I went to work for &ldquo;DoubleDay&rdquo; Books (aka Bookspan) creating hundreds of book jacket layouts and designs for about 20 different book clubs. Currently, I work from home as a freelance consultant, allowing me to pursue my passion for type design and developing new and innovative fonts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s challenging to add fresh new typeface design ideas with so many fonts out there today. To coin a phrase &ldquo;All the good type design ideas have already been taken&rdquo;. But, I still keep trying. Although I occasionally do a new text face, the majority of my work is in display fonts. Much more interesting to experiment with a single font concept then working out and coordinating a super-family of weights, styles and fonts. Although, creating &ldquo;Geomatrix&rdquo; was no small task. I started by modifying a weight of my &ldquo;[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax Pro]] and creating an interesting &ldquo;stencil&rdquo; version. And, I thought the work was done. Then, I decided to expand the glyph sets to include &ldquo;oldstyle figures&rdquo; and all the &ldquo;Eastern European&rdquo; characters sets. I should of stopped there. But, no, I had to continue to play with the design to include all sorts of alternate &lsquo;capital&rsquo; letter forms and unique &lsquo;ligature-type&rsquo; word combinations. After 1,629 glyphs I finally stopped. I hope the effort was worth it. I&rsquo;m exhausted.</p>
<p>I would like to publicly thank everyone at this &ldquo;Type Forum&rdquo; for helping me resolve certain &lsquo;encoding&rsquo; and &ldquo;OpenType&rdquo; feature issues. Without your help I probably would have given up much earlier. Please let me know what you think of &ldquo;[[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/type-innovations/geomatrix|Geomatrix]]. Thank you. And, I&rsquo;m off to the next font(s) !!!</p>
<p>Manufacturer Statement 
The font &quot; [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/type-innovations/geomatrix|Geomatrix]] is an original design by Alex Kaczun. It is a dynamic stencil interpretation based on his extremely successful &ldquo;[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax Pro]] family of geometric sans typefaces. &ldquo;Geomatrix&rdquo; is a contemporary stencil typeface based on generous proportions and clean, crisp lines.The stencil treatment is balanced visually with the stem weight of the font which creates a uniformity and harmony within the design. &ldquo;Geomatrix&rdquo; makes for easy reading and is ideal for long lines of copy. It exudes a strong sense of sophistication for a true stencil design.</p>
<p>However, this is no ordinary stencil typeface. That&rsquo;s putting it mildly. Geomatrix is a font on &lsquo;STEROIDS&rdquo;! This unique OpenType font incorporates hundreds of &ldquo;CAPITAL&rdquo; alternate letter forms and glyph substitutions, automatically and on the fly, within &ldquo;InDesign&rdquo; and other &ldquo;OT&rdquo; applications. To turn this feature on, just typeset &lsquo;ALL CAPS&rdquo; and go into InDesign&rsquo;s &lsquo;OpenType&gt;Stylistic Sets&rsquo; and select &lsquo;Set 1&rsquo; from the menu. Turn character kerning from &ldquo;Metrics&rdquo; to &ldquo;Optical&rdquo;, adjust tracking to minus 20-30, and start typing to create some visually interesting letter substitutions and unique word combinations. &ldquo;Geomatrix&rdquo; was specifically designed to take advantage of the OpenType format, allowing the &ldquo;Graphic Designer&rdquo; a unique tool to achieve the desired degree of possible visual typographic effects.</p>
<p>And finally, the character sets in &ldquo;Geomatrix&rdquo; have been expanded to include &lsquo;oldstyle figures&rsquo; and all &lsquo;Eastern European&rsquo; accented glyphs. Strap in and hold on to your seats. A revolution in new font technologies has begun!</p>
