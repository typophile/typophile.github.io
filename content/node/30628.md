body: "Garden Design magazine (US) recently redesigned and makes extensive use of
  this DIN-like sans. Distinctive characters include the g, the sloped legs of the
  M, high x-height, and the overall squareness.\r\n\r\nEarly hunches that didn't pan
  out: Flama (Feliciano), CP Company (Fabrizio Schiavi), Metroflex (Garagefonts).
  And no, it's not DIN or Conduit. ;)\r\n\r\n(Apologies for the images -- I don't
  have a scanner handy.)\r\n\r\nThanks, and happy hunting!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gdn_dsgn1_5783.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gdn_dsgn2_5138.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gdn_dsgn3_5632.jpg]"

  body: Good catch, schnappi. I'm often asked for alternates to DIN and hadn't thought
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=24&displayfontid=M.116815.0.0&fontRendererText=WINNERS+english">Scene</a>.
    Great to have another in the tool chest.
