  forms, turned 86 on March 1. Typophile, arguably the greatest living forum on the
  forms of the language, also very recently marked a birthday. To celebrate, then,
  here is a typographic consideration from Wilbur:\r\n\r\n\r\n&\r\nby Richard Wilbur\r\n\r\nA
  slopeshouldered shape from scurrying burdens\r\nBackward and forth, or perhaps a
  lyre\r\nOr a clef wrung wry in tuning untunable tones\r\nOr a knot for tugging an
  out-of-hand.\r\n\r\nVine to the trellis in clerical gardens:\r\nSweetness & light,
  ice & fire,\r\nNature & art have dissocketed all your bones,\r\nPorter, poor pander
  ampersand."
