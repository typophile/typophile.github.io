  body: I think it&#39;s a customized version of <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80222005P1"
    target="_blank">Berthold City Bold</a>. <BR> <BR>If you make wedges of the serifs,
    and make the legs on the K symmetrical, I think you get this. The C is already
    identical, the M crotch is the same height, the G chin is the same height, the
    S is squared the same way, the R has the same proportions.  <BR> <BR>At least
    that&#39;s how I think it was done.
