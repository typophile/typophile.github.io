  photographs of manmade objects that resemble letterforms and also make quick blurbs
  about said letterforms on adjacent pages. So here's where I'm asking for some help:
  I have a few photos of some less traditional letterforms and I'm hoping you typophiles
  might help me find appropriate fonts that match my photos. \r\n\r\nHere's where
  I need the most help:\r\nI need a P that has a tall counter-\r\n[[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/4115514654_e6eb3cd7d0.jpg]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  I need a C that looks more like a filled semicircle-\r\n[[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2559/4115514692_0180348f0b.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIt
  shouldn't be too tough to find appropriate matches, but this school computer's set
  of fonts is a little wimpy. Thanks!"
