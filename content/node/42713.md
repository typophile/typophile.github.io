body: "Does anyone know of a font which contains the London underground roundel as
  a character? I am working on a book which requires the icon in each of something
  around 1000 entries. I've found P22 Johnston underground extras, but the only roundel
  it contains is one in which the bar doesn't run through the centre of the circle,
  and which is also too heavy for my purposes.\r\nAny suggestions gratefully received.\r\n"

    it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/tubek_6188.jpg] \r\nIt works at very small
    typesizes and is widely recognised."

  body: I know I have it somewhere, but I just can't remember which font it is. I've
    looked through all the fonts beginning with trans* and underground - but so far
    come up blank. I'll keep looking, though... =/

  body: The London Transport Roundel is a trademark of London Transport and can only
    be used with their permission as per their design guidelines. This is why it is
    not included as a character in P22 Underground Extras.
