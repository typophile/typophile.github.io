  \u201Cfundamentals for typography\u201D class with other 59 students who have no
  idea what a typeface is other than Times New Roman or Helvetica. Professor demanded
  we all buy Adobe Font Folio for $149, and students are immediately grunting over
  the price.\r\n\r\nAnd then somebody found out that we can install endless copies
  of the same font files on different computers...! And everyone in the Facebook discussion
  group starts feeling the ecstasy of avoiding yet another hefty fee. (Wait that wasn\u2019t
  hefty \u2013 you get 50 families for $149 from Adobe, while purchasing one family
  already costs normally $100-200!)\r\n\r\nThere are two sad points. For one, my classmates
  take font pirating as something to be celebrated, and openly discusses about it
  (\u201CI\u2019ll buy you meals if you send me that font folio!\u201D); and second,
  I feel like typefaces are luxuries \u2013 the amount of sweat and blood they require
  are no less than other kinds of luxury products like crafting wooden furniture.
  That\u2019s why they are so expensive (aside from the corporates\u2019 licensing
  barriers or some Monopoly bad-ass behavior). Students can\u2019t afford good typefaces,
  and there are no good way around other than \u201Ceducational discounts.\u201D"

  body: Well, there used to be Corel products with the Bitstream portfolio; older
    versions were sometimes available quite cheap in some stores. But I suspect that's
    worse, not better, from your point of view - and getting a pile of fonts for $10
    instead of $149 won't stop people from pirating them afterwards anyways.

    body: "I think epidemic pirating is not precisely the issue here \u2013 if Adobe
      give out a special discount of, say, the Font Folio for $14.9, I\u2019m sure
      all students would rather buy it. They will need to take a picture of the current
      student ID, or scan a transcript, &c. and send it to some verification department.
      I\u2019ve seen software companies doing this. For example, Papers (citation
      managing software) asks you to take a picture of your student ID card to offer
      you a half discount."

  body: "At $149 for 500 fonts, the Adobe Font Folio Education Essentials is incredibly
    inexpensive compared to most font bundles, even compared to most educational pricing.
    I assembled that collection in consultation with AIGA when I was at Adobe, and
    we literally made it as cheap as we could possibly manage, given the royalty obligations
    on some of the fonts. I can't comment in detail, but I will say that I am pretty
    sure Adobe has a lower profit margin on that product than on anything else they
    sell.\r\n\r\nMost quality fonts sell individually for $25-35. Some of the families
    included in full in that package sell for several times the cost of the bundle!\r\n\r\nAssuming
    your profile is still up to date... it's not like you are in some third world
    country, where both incomes and cultural norms are different. Y'all are in Seattle,
    for crying out loud. Is their tuition free? Do they pirate all their software
    when possible?"

    body: "Yes, I\u2019m in Seattle. Students here can spend hundreds of bucks on
      new iPhones or new computers, but do not want to spend that $149 on a font bundle.
      They can definitely afford it; it\u2019s just they haven\u2019t realized the
      value of good type in comparison to the apparent utility of iPhones and computers.
      To start things off, typography education (at my program at least) shouldn\u2019t
      teach \u201Cascenders\u201D or \u201Cx-height\u201D before telling the students
      why these things matter and why we should pay for it.\r\n\r\nBut when I say
      students can\u2019t afford good typefaces, my point still stands. Yes, spending
      $149 on Font Folio is totally affordable, but there\u2019s only one Adobe, only
      one AIGA decision, and only one font bundle; you can\u2019t simply demand every
      foundry to do the same. What if you want a family of, say, FF Kievit, to set
      your final project in a class? And you seriously go give $1000 to Fontfont,
      just to buy a family that you\u2019ll probably not use again? (And your instructor
      may also say, \u201CKievit is so well designed, let\u2019s make the purchase
      of Kievit mandatory\u201D...)\r\n\r\nP.S. Tuition is not free of course (even
      much higher for int\u2019l students like me), but people do pirate (or try to
      pirate) Adobe CC for sure."

  body: "Obviously, tuition has to cost something, because professors have to eat.
    Actually, this <em>isn't</em> obvious, since schoolteachers also have to eat,
    and professors could be paid the same way (of course, they partly are; tuition
    or the post-secondary institutions themselves are subsidized by the government
    in most places).\r\n\r\nBut a society in which everyone who isn't labelled as
    mentally retarded is expected to stay in school until he or she gets a Ph.D. (or
    an M.D. or an LL.D.) is not likely to come about - one where all those with the
    ability to go to university can do so is already a radical and Utopian dream;
    assuming that nearly everyone has that ability is probably wrong, although given
    economic demand in different labor categories, our society has really not made
    the effort to develop everyone's potential so as to find out.\r\n\r\nStill, this
    is an unanticipated extra expenditure. It's bad enough that students have to pay
    high prices for textbooks, which are in some cases revised periodically when changes
    in the subject matter do not warrant doing so, in order to limit access to books
    on the used market. Who has heard of a university using books from Dover for suitable
    subjects like first-year physics or first-year calculus?\r\n\r\nAfter they finish
    paying their tuition and for their textbooks, after all, students usually aren't
    rich. Unless they're among the few fortunate enough to have wealthy parents."

  body: "A few thoughts: \r\n1. the price of these fonts is a bargain any way you
    look at it.\r\n2. prices too low risk to send the wrong message about the value
    of quality fonts, thus worsening the problem.\r\n3. there always will be people
    who feel entitled to free stuff, in principle.\r\n\r\nAll that said, all costs
    should be made clear before the start: if I want to attend, I need to know beforehand
    what (if anything) is provided by the school in exchange of tuition, and how much
    more I will need to spend in addition (be it for books, pencils or fonts)."

  body: "Some of those students probably pirate music, movies, etc., so it's not that
    much of a leap to do it for fonts too. \r\n\r\nBut I agree that $149 can seem
    like a lot if it comes as a surprise. If you're working part-time making minimum
    wage, that might be a week's salary."

  body: Given the lengths that Adobe went to in order to discount those fonts as they
    did, of course it's sad. I think that it should be possible to acknowledge that
    font piracy is wrong without being unable to also note that you don't have to
    be living in a Third World country for even $149 to be a lot of money to you.

  body: "Different question \u2014 why is a professor \"demanding\" that their students
    buy anything? Shouldn't the school purchase the fonts for their computers? Yes,
    classes require purchasing books and art classes sometimes require purchasing
    supplies or have fees for art supplies, but this seems an unreasonable expense
    to ask students to undertake themselves. If the professor thinks they need it,
    the professor (or their department) should buy it."

  body: "If they're still grumbling, I advised on writing a [[http://examhints.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-best-free-fonts-for-education|blog
    post]] on good free fonts for education use a while back - basically the plan
    was to round up ones that don't look like default system fonts PCs normally come
    with. (It's biased towards fonts that are good for teaching use though.)\r\n\r\nI
    do find that requirement to pay $149 for doing a specific college course rather
    steep, though. (No offence to Mr. Phinney meant there-it's just not how most universities
    I've heard of work.) I know you can't borrow software from the college library
    like books, but can't they buy licenses for their lab computers and let you use
    them for work?"

    fonts, that you can use for all of your student work across classes, and for the
    rest of your life. They aren't time limited or only for student work.
