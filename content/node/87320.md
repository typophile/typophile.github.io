  body: Since the letters are a pseudo rough brush look a natural brush would not
    give you that affect. Old scary movies from the 1940's and 50's used these type
    of hand drawn letters for titling. You might be able to get close with a large
    house painting brush and thick paint. Ultimately the ends of strokes are drawn,
    so you wouldn't need to paint a lot of letters if you were to try that. Just enough
    to base the look on.

  body: I think <em>the</em> way to do this is to manually draw it in Illustrator,
    using an existing script face converted to outlines as your basis. The job might
    seem daunting but I think it would go quite quickly once you get going, particularly
    if you create a small set of cutout shapes that you use repeatedly.
