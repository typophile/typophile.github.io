  body: The space is a character that you can edit the advance width of in Fontlab.
    If you want to make any sequence of glyphs be the same width, then you must make
    it so in the two fonts, that they have identical advance widths (and kerning).

  body: Hi, thanks, yes the word space is actually the same. When the italic is selected
    in InDesign it slightly does not keep the right word space/bearing/side measurement,
    the attached image might help as well? When the italic is selected it looks like
    it is nearly touching the roman weight?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/problem2_4355.gif]

  body: "Are you saying that is not an accurate reflection of how the italic \"h\"
    sits between its sidebearings? What I'm seeing there makes it look as if you have
    not made the left shift I described above. The purpose of that is essentially
    to re-center the x-height portion of the letter between the sidebearings.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "<em>.... When the italic is selected it looks like it is nearly touching
    the roman weight?</em>\r\n\r\nIf you work with FL, you have 4 options as a reference
    to slant transformation: <strong><em>\"Zero Point, Center of Selection, Bottom
    Left Corner</em>, and <em>Reference Point\"</em></strong>. What happens to your
    description seems to use the reference \"zero point\" or \"Bottom left corner\".
    If you choose the \"center of selection\", then you'll get a glyph (some still
    do) amid heavy point glyph box. This will solve the problem of individual glyphs.
    But will most likely change the composition of the kerning and metrics when applied
    to all existing glyphs.\r\n\r\nIMHO, indeed more appropriate to use the reference
    \"zero point\" or \"Bottom left corner\" but it should do a re-adjustment as the
    value that has been suggested by <strong>Thomas</strong>. Or a practical way:
    subtract the left bearing with a specified value (eg -10) but you have to add
    +10 on the right bearing. This is I called a \"zero sum balance\" aims to glyph
    still get the same size of glyph box. This method is more stable against possibility
    of changing the composition of kerning\r\n\r\n<strong>@Thomas</strong> ... Thanks
    for your formula. it's interesting to try\r\n\r\nBest Regatds."

  body: "OOPS, error in my formula! Should be 1/2 * xheight * [sin (italic angle)].
    Somehow I got a divide instead of a multiply. (I went back and edited it in my
    original post, too. I just don't want to leave anybody messed up who just reads
    it there.)\r\n\r\nNote also that if you use Excel, it expects angles in radians
    rather than degrees. The Excel version of my formula would be: \r\n=0.5*SIN(RADIANS(n))*x\r\n\r\nWhere
    \"n\" is the italic angle and \"x\" is the x-height. You can bump up that 0.5
    a little to maybe even 0.6, if you want to accomodate caps and letters with ascenders
    a bit more.\r\n\r\nBTW, the \"average\" results of my formula, with a 1000-unit
    em, a 500-unit x-height, and an 11 degree italic angle, should be about 47 units
    to shift.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\"IMHO, indeed more appropriate to use the reference
    \"zero point\" \"\r\n\r\nI agree whole-heartedly. For a starting point for italics,
    that's about the only sane thing to do. Then do the global left shift on the whole
    font.\r\n\r\nOf course, that transformed glyph may be just a placeholder for one
    that has been properly reshaped. Even in a sans serif, you'll need to do something
    else to get your round letters the right shape. But having that initial auto-transform
    might still be helpful for positioning/spacing.\r\n\r\nOf course, I suck at spacing
    anyway, feel free to ignore me.  :)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps this is already being done, but....\r\n\r\nIn terms of the relationship
    between upright and italic, generally after you slant* the italic, you need to
    also shift all the glyphs slightly to the left, to compensate for their new lean
    to the right.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the shift is arguable. Do you do the compensation
    based on making up for the italics at half the x-height, or half the cap height,
    or something in between? I tend to go about 50-60% of x-height....\r\n\r\nSo the
    amount of shift is about 1/2 * xheight * [sin (italic angle)].\r\n\r\n* Of course
    it is usually more than just slanting.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: fixed error in formula!]"

    makes the most sense. And I think it's also a good reason that we should not use
    the value arbitrarily. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nBest regards"
