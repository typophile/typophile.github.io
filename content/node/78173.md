body: "In his book <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>, Robert Bringhurst sets
  forth what he considers to the be the ideal for setting text. He states:\r\n\r\n-
  45 to 75 characters line length (measure); specifically 66 including spaces; Single
  Column\r\n- 40 to 50 characters; multi-column\r\n- 85 to 90 characters; discontinuous
  text; generous leading\r\n- 40 characters (minimum); justified\r\n- 12 to 15 characters;
  marginal notes; English\r\n\r\nHe also discusses the ideal page to great detail
  on pp. 171\u2013176.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to find other authors who've written down
  their ideals. What have you found as you've read? Would you share your findings?
  Even just the books and page numbers would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    interior design. I would recommend Rich Hendel's <cite>On Book Design</cite>.
    Or my favorite, <cite>The Art of the Printed Book</cite>, which shows solutions
    from over 400 years, encompassing varying fashions and notions of \"ideal.\"\r\n\r\nSmall
    examples:\r\n\r\nThe largest set of problems an interior designer faces are problems
    occasioned by the text itself. If you say \"See spot run\" over and over, a number
    of ideal characters per line can be used. But the evenness of word spacing is
    controlled by the number of spaces in the line, not the number of characters.\r\n\r\nAnother
    small example is the sheet, if the book to be run on a sheet-fed press. Does a
    6-1/8 x 9-1/4 trim cost the same as a 6x9? It does from several book printers,
    so the extra size of the sheet allows different margins. And that space can be
    used for a number of things.\r\n\r\nI know. The response to the above could be,
    \"Well, so what? Suppose everything works out\" What's ideal?\" But it is the
    same answer: the ideal is determined by the text, given the constraints of manufacturing.
    Were it otherwise, IBM could design a computer that not only won at <cite>Jeopardy!</cite>,
    but replaced book designers. Then where would we be?"

    a believer in the \"2 1/2 lower case alphabets\" ideal for single column text.
    This is in Felici and amounts to the same thing as Bringhurst. I do find something
    that wide inviting for extended reading, and wider off-putting.\r\n\r\nI am talking
    about printed books with extended text.  \r\n\r\nI heard Bill Hill at TypeCon
    saying that that width is ideal because more causes us to turn our heads, rather
    than just our eyes, so that we are more likely to lose the line. I don't know
    where Bill Hill got it, though. \r\n\r\nIn multi-column and lay-out with more
    white space there is more flexibility. \r\n\r\nThe other rule I have read that
    I believe is that sans, compared to good serifed text fonts, usually require shorter
    lines and more leading to be readable, for more than a few lines. \r\n\r\nps.
    I think that stating the rule in terms of \"characters\" can be misleading because
    the i and m are both characters, but one a lot wider than the other... "

    is the point size of the type. And the typeface itself is a concern as well; thus,
    if one is going to use generous leading, one shouldn't use a typeface with ruthlessly
    shortened descenders.\r\n\r\nOne book I have, \"A Composition Manual\", published
    by the Printing Industries of America, gave, in the specific case of 10 point
    type, leaded 2 points, a list of recommendations from various authorities:\r\n\r\nReadability
    tests by Lukiesh and Moss: 13 pica ems\r\nSherbow's type charts: 15 pica ems\r\n\r\nThe
    usual theory in printing at the time is cited as 1 1/2 alphabets, or 40 characters,
    which seems to be equivalent to 17 pica ems in the sample displayed.\r\n\r\nA
    reader preference test is cited as yielding 19 pica ems.\r\n\r\nA Dr. Javal and
    a Professor Huey advocate 21 pica ems (Dr. Javal as a maximum).\r\n\r\nTwo alphabets
    are then noted as the ideal of some other printers who dissent from the usual
    1 1/2 alphabet rule of thumb. This appears to be about 22 1/2 pica ems.\r\n\r\nLessons
    in printing published by the International Typographical Union give 22 to 24 pica
    ems as the ideal.\r\n\r\nScientific studies conducted in Britain are cited as
    establishing the rule that the ideal line length should not be over 24 pica ems.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    checked the width of lines in typical textbooks, and found they range from 21
    to 25 pica ems.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, Professors Patterson and Tinker are cited
    as recommending the range of 14 to 31 pica ems.\r\n\r\nSo, at least at one time,

    large type, with a large left margin, and ample right margin. Wide type, like

    size so character count and leading are not the only factors. I find that line
    length is determined mostly by other layout and fitting concerns.  This is not
    true when doing a straight text novel but I have never done one of those. When
    reading a straight text book, I tend to like the way Unger's book \"While You
    Were Reading\" is set. I can read the text easily without getting whiplash and
    can hold the book at a nice comfortable distance.\r\n\r\nI am not much for \"magic\"
    combinations of proportion, length, size, and leading but I do like a nice healthy
    margin to separate the text from the background clutter of the world.  This is
    my opinion and is not science by any means.  It seems there have been fashions
    of setting that have come, gone, and returned. There have also been technological
    reasons like newspaper fitting and simple things like physical galley dropping.
    \ It must be a bitch to carry around a galley of type that is 10 inches wide!
    In magazines and newspapers, you have the positioning of ads and graphics to consider

    are distracting. So if a guideline for column width is only going to be used as
    a rule for deciding when to split the page into two columns, as the size of type
    is out of the control of the typographer (it being, presumably, the minimum one
    can get away with), then a broad range, like 1 1/4 alphabets to 2 1/2 alphabets,
    which encompasses a factor of two, makes sense.\r\n\r\nLet us then take, not 1
    3/4, not 1 1/4, but... 1 5/8 alphabets as the optimum line length. 2 is a bit
    long, 1 1/2 is a bit short, but the shorter one is closer to the optimum. 1 1/4
    to 2 1/2 are the acceptable range.\r\n\r\nSo, as the part of the page left after
    the margins gradually widens, we know what to do.\r\n\r\nWhen that width passes
    2 1/2 alphabets, we split the page into two columns at 1 1/4 alphabets.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it reaches 4 1/2 alphabets, that leaves us with two columns at 2 1/4 alphabets
    which we can split into three columns at 1 1/2 alphabets. But perhaps the point
    at which we should go from two columns to three is a bit earlier than this.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it reaches 6 alphabets, we pass from three columns at 2 alphabets to four columns
    at 1 1/2 alphabets.\r\n\r\nTo conserve our forest resources, margins are also
    unlikely to be as generous as they ideally should be. Personally, I tend to think
    of anything over 3/4 inch as ostentation, but there is a time and place to wallow
    in that. A short book of fairy-tales for children, for example, should be made
    to look like William Morris or someone of similar tastes had printed it.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I am partial to crystal goblets, I also think there are exceptions, and not every
    book should fit this pattern. There are times when it is entirely appropriate
    for a book to have a noticeable and distinctive look that fits its contents, and

    form on the Internet Archive (the 1912 book, and its 1917 supplement, are there
    too, and in quality scans), that book is also [[http://www.archive.org/details/TheManualOfLinotypeTypography|available
    there]]. It is well scanned, but it's only available in DJVU format, which is
    a trifle inconvenient.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree there are no \"magic combinations\",
    one could, even if unseriously, give a specific set of measurements as a starting
    point. However, one of the most fundamental attributes of a typeface can't properly
    be specified for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIf I were to say that the ideal book were
    set in 11 point type with 3 points leading, I would also have to specify the typeface.
    Because, of course, the crucial variable isn't the size of the type in points,
    but its x-height.\r\n\r\nIn metal type, it might be 11 point Caslon 540 with 3
    points leading... or 13 point Jenson with 1 point leading, because some typefaces
    have very short and stubby descenders, and others have long ones - and extra leading
    takes the place of the missing descenders.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I have the answer
    now: the ideal column width is 1 3/4 alphabets. I can say this, because I have
    looked upon the ideal book, and measured its column width - by retyping its text
    in a similar typeface under two alphabets of that typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_width_4514.jpg]\r\n\r\nOf
    course, this <em>is</em> unserious, as it just represents one opinion about the
    matter, but at least it shows what 1 3/4 alphabets looks like."

    that they do represent the ideal, even if it is an ideal that is seldom considered
    worth the effort.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris noted that one wouldn't typeset a scientific
    treatise in the manner of a fine-print book. I would suggest that there is still
    at least one place for fine-print books, even today, however. Large type, generous
    margins, and a typeface as gentle on the eyes as possible, with some suggestion
    of antique character, would seem entirely appropriate to a children's book about
    dragons and castles and the like. Since books for small children are usually short,
    and they are usually set in large type in any event, designing them to fine-print
    standards ought not to affect their affordability.\r\n\r\nSo I can't claim to
    practice what I preach. But as musical texts on harmony and counterpoint are wont
    to reiterate, one must first know the rules well before one is equipped to break
    them without disaster; and, so, while knowing that 1 1/2 alphabets is an ideal,
    whether of beauty or legibility, may be small comfort to the typesetter of a textbook
    on quantum mechanics who must make do with three, at least he will thereby know
    enough to split his page into two columns rather than to force his reader to endure
    lines that are <em>five</em> alphabets in length.\r\n\r\nThus, in my example of
    Morris, above, I showed where his note on the founding of the Kelmscott Press
    was set with a width of 1 1/2 alphabets. But he also countenanced 1 3/4 alphabets,
    as in his \"The Story of the Glittering Plain\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_width3_4211.jpg]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    one can also get quite far from fine-print books to the domain of computer manuals,
    and we will find that when a large company like IBM feels that enough copies of
    a manual will be printed that actual typesetting is justified, even then the same
    rules of legibility will be heeded; and so, two columns were used, but with a
    width of 1 7/8 alphabets each, in the first edition of System/360 Principles of
    Operation:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_width5_5827.jpg]"

  body: "It certainly is true that narrow columns require the ability to hyphenate.
    Since, at least for a time, word processing software or typesetting equipment
    could not include a hyphenation dictionary, if it was desired to enter body copy
    for which the size of the type or the width of the column might be altered (or
    even where the text might be edited), it was necessary to use a column wide enough
    so that, at need, one could achieve acceptable results even without hyphenation.\r\n\r\nHaving
    shown examples of famous works with narrow column sizes, now I want to show some
    with wider columns. Telling the student that the rule is 1 3/4 alphabets, but
    it is not to be taken too seriously, is not really enough. Some guidance as to
    line length is needed to give an explicit scale to the printed line; one can't
    rely on every student having an instinctive feel for the matter. But just saying
    this isn't a strict rule leaves ambiguity. Instead, the next step is to investigate
    what is the acceptable range for line widths.\r\n\r\nThis famous example of a
    \"fine-print\" document is 2 1/4 alphabets wide, and yet is held to be one of
    the finest specimens of printing (this is <em>not</em> an image of the original,
    I have merely retyped the text in a similar font, preserving the line breaks,
    and without justification, to determine the width in alphabets):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_w6_6274.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
    is some text from Hansard's <em>Typographia: An Historical Sketch</em>, which
    also measures at 2 1/4 alphabets, although it is intended to be merely good but
    plain printing:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_w7_3549.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    now here is an example of something that I thought might be seen as too wide,
    although, at 2 3/4 alphabets, it turns out that this is not true by much, if at
    all: the famous Frankford Arsenal Handbook of Optics, MIL-HDBK-141:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_w8_5014.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    now, at least, it becomes possible to give some practical guidance: anything from
    1 1/2 to 2 1/4 alphabets is excellent, and after about 2 1/2 alphabets, it's time
    to begin thinking about alternatives. After about 3 alphabets, one is starting
    to get into trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd another example of something on the long side
    is also 2 3/4 alphabets wide, Simon Newcomb's account of his theory of the motions
    of Neptune:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_w10_3874.jpg]\r\n\r\nThus,
    it's even hard to find actual historical examples that go beyond 2 3/4 alphabets,
    which can be considered indicative."

    is from <em>Williams' Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language</em>. For the
    most part, where there is textual matter, the page is split into two columns.
    This includes the Introduction to the work, but not the Preface, which extends
    in a single column across the page.\r\n\r\nThe Preface is, therefore, set in a
    larger type. The text in the example, however, is from an extended quotation from
    <em>within</em> the Preface, which is thus in a smaller type than the surrounding
    text.\r\n\r\nThus, those who typeset the book were under no illusions that a line
    width equivalent to 4 alphabets was desirable, but it was considered tolerable
    for a short bit, and preferable to disturbing the over-all layout of the book

    puzzled by the standard applied in the reference I cited. It cited several authorities
    that only mentioned one, but they were able to show a comparison chart and equivalence
    line lengths to characters per line. They had assumed a specific point size, 10
    points, and I suppose that helped them, but I have to suspect they may have been
    guessing in some cases.\r\n\r\nBut, as I noted, while something <em>like</em>
    point size is needed if you want to convert between \"alphabets\" and \"pica ems\"
    (<em>A Composition Manual</em> actually just said picas, but other references
    always use the term \"pica em\" for a pica as a horizontal distance; I don't know
    if that's more correct or archaic, though), point size itself just doesn't cut
    it.\r\n\r\nSome faces are condensed. Some faces have a larger x-height than others.\r\n\r\nNow,
    it could be that there are <em>two independent constraints</em> on line width
    - one relating to the amount of text in a line, the one I've been investigating,
    coming to the conclusion that the range 1 1/2 to 2 3/4 alphabets is appropriate
    - and another relating to the absolute width of a line.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if one
    assumes that a book is held at some standard distance from the eyes, it's the
    absolute width of the column that determines how much eye movement is necessary."

    essay I [[http://typophile.com/node/78173#comment-448169|mentioned.]] It was first
    published in Switzerland, 1972, IIRC, and later on became part of the collection
    published by Brinkmann & Bose. As far as I know, there is no (official) English
    translation yet. It's only 2.5 pages long, plus lots of figures. Here is a first,
    rough translation of its central parts [I know, I should really get a De<->En
    typographic dictionary]...\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nNils.\r\n\r\n--------------8<-------------------------8<-------------------------8<---------------\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nLooking
    at figures 1 to 3, we could draw the conclusion that a wider measure will always
    yield a more even word spacing. This is only true in a very broad sense. My study
    will show that a width difference of a mere cicero can result in a major difference
    in word spacing.\r\n   Figures 4 to 6 use the same type size as figures 1 to 3,
    but the measure is wider. It's no surprise that the 16-cicero measure doesn't
    look perfect -- what is surprising, though, is the fact that even a 19-cicero
    measure does not yield even word spacing. Using an 18-cicero measure, the paragraph
    looks a lot better! So in this typeface (and in the German language!), an 18-cicero
    measure is better than a 19-cicero one.\r\n   Even 20 and 21 cicero (figures 7
    and 8) are not much better than 19 cicero, which is even more surprising. It takes
    a 22-cicero measure to get a pleasant paragraph. We see that, for [11-point] Baskerville
    and the German language, 22 cicero is the \\enquote*{best} measure.\r\n   In German
    language, that is! I remains to be seen if the same holds true for English or
    French. [...] And our results are only valid for Baskerville. A different typeface
    of the same optical size, using the same measure, will not always, or rather:
    will never yield an equally good result. [...] The whole issue is pretty complex,
    even mysterious, and depends on a number of factors. There will hardly ever be
    a definite, universal answer. \r\n</code>\r\n\r\nFigures 1 to 4: 11-point Baskerville;

    turned 180 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe iPad, with it's ability to \"throw scroll\" (I
    don't have a better word for it, anybody?) had a lot to do with that.\r\nWhile
    there might be some content that lends itself to 'carding' pagination, there isn't
    much.\r\nUsers can and should be given control over the layout. But defaults still
    count for a lot.\r\nThe universal adoption of Zoom as the default size/resize
    mechanism has changed the game. Pixels aren't what they used to be.\r\nNow, if
    you want a font size change you have to include the code for that within the page.
    That's a big change that has gone largely unremarked. My understanding is that
    Webkit even has a CSS property for turning off zoom. (Memory is failing me on
    the specifics.) And in that case, we are back to a fixed 'optical' size - if the
    author wants to saddle the user with that without options.\r\nBad idea, IMHO.\r\nBut
    min-width/max-width has some legitimacy, I think. As a starting point. \r\n\r\nMy
    eye doctor - a retinal specialist - is using iPads affixed to the wall for his
    eye testing charts. (Progressive dude, obviously.)\r\n\r\nMobile and the problems
    inherent in tiny screens are going to take awhile to sort out.\r\nAuthors and
    users alike are going to be climbing a learning curve that's going to go on for
    a long time to come. It's just beginning, really. And - as the old clich&eacute;
    has it - we ain't seen nothin' yet!\r\n\r\n(BTW - I was in LA for SOTA conf but

    that option for their perusal?\r\n\r\nthis is, indeed, the question that's often
    the most pressing one...\r\nit's usually quite easy to program a function to pull
    off a feature,\r\neven one like the one described right above.  but what is often\r\n_extremely_
    difficult is the development of an intuitive interface\r\nto let an unsophisticated

    e-book viewer-program is an app that displays an e-book...\r\n\r\nto save our
    time and energy, we often want to create a single app\r\nthat will display any
    and all books that use the same file-format...\r\nfor the most part, these apps
    must, by definition, be \"conventional\",\r\nbecause they will (to some extent)
    treat all the books the same way.\r\n\r\nbut for a book that is unconventional,
    you just build a one-off app.\r\n\r\n\r\n>   Or reading PDFs that are made up
    of page images of old books?\r\n\r\nyou answered your own question there.  .pdf
    is a great format for\r\na fixed-page book, which is just what a bunch of scans
    would be...\r\n\r\n\r\n>   Maybe there, what is needed is a map of how the text

    i understand the preoccupation with two-column pages.\r\n\r\nbut yes, you can
    layer in the text _behind_ the scan on a .pdf page,\r\nwhich makes the .pdf _searchable_,
    in a way that pure-scans are not\r\n(since the scan is just a _picture_ of the
    text, and not the text itself).\r\nthis is what is done at octavo.com, which is

    the .pdf format...\r\n\r\nor you can take another approach, and _replicate_ the
    paper-book\r\nin electronic form, with a \"cloning\" that creates an _exact_reprint_...\r\n\r\nfor
    examples of this, see the \"digital reprints\" from jose menendez:\r\n\r\n> http://www.ibiblio.org/ebooks/Mabie/Books_Culture.pdf\r\n>

    these are .pdf e-books which clone the paper-book...\r\n\r\n(the einstein book
    is especially fun, because jose has inserted\r\ncorrections to some mistakes made
    by the original publisher.)\r\n\r\none interesting thing you should know about
    the \"reprints\" is\r\na click on any page-number (in mabie and einstein) summons\r\nthe
    _scan_ of that page -- from google -- for your reference,\r\nwith the .pdf page
    side-by-side with the scan in your browser,\r\n\r\nthis means there is a very
    tight coupling between the versions.\r\n\r\nit also means you can verify the two
    versions are highly similar\r\n(right down to the end-line hyphenated words being
    retained),\r\nand if you pull up a few pages you'll see for yourself it is true,\r\nexcept,
    of course, the .pdf doesn't have any \"broken type\", or\r\ncrooked pages, or
    pictures of the scanner's thumb in a corner.\r\n\r\nthe problem with jose's e-books
    are that we only have them\r\nin the .pdf format, so it's not possible for us
    to \"remix\" them,\r\nby -- for instance -- editing them, or creating another
    .pdf\r\nthat has a different pagesize, or font, or leading, or margins...\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"

    for the same reason that lowercase is superior to all-caps, I don't think the
    strong modern preference for ranging figures can be overcome.\r\n\r\nAfter all,
    people don't try to read and comprehend long masses of digits. An individual number
    stands out more clearly from the surrounding text, and is thus more quickly recognizable
    as a number, if it is in ranging figures. In many places where numbers are used,
    uniformity is expected, and a clear distinction between numbers and lowercase
    letters is needed in algebraic formulae.\r\n\r\nOf course, sometimes, digits are
    mixed with capital letters. In that case, oldstyle figures would be more distinct,
    but at least, since capital letters tend to have square corners, and digits tend
    to be rounded, and narrower than capital letters, and so the weakness in this
    area is limited."

    was raised by someone writing about an individual author with a polysyllabic style,
    before we came to Jan Tschihold's book, is the question of other factors.\r\n\r\nI
    was looking at the question of the ideal line length in the context I thought
    it was initially raised - what is best for the reader, if it can be achieved.
    That a shorter line is harder for the printer to hyphenate is <em>his</em> problem,
    and so if a particular writer, or a particular language, makes it harder to break
    lines so as to achieve even spacing... that affects the ease of achieving the
    ideal, not what the ideal is.\r\n\r\nBut the narrow columns occasionally used
    when text is wrapped around images, or in some newspapers, are indeed criticized
    as too narrow specifically because horrendous spacing is occasionally needed.
    Assuming hyphenation is possible, though, this sets in at widths line one alphabet,
    or 3/4 alphabets, significantly below 1 1/2 alphabets.\r\n\r\nGerman may have
    very long words in it, but it doesn't have very long syllables.\r\n\r\n@bowerbird:\r\nIt's

    which would have been useful in relation to the issue which you raised.\r\n\r\nThe
    question of whether text in E-books should flow or not relates to their fundamental
    design. And so debating that issue can hardly provide hits on how someone preparing

    can afford to pay new hardcover prices for a lousy reading experience.\r\n\r\nFixing
    the problem, though, isn't up to typographers. They haven't got the power to tell
    Apple how it should make the iPad work. I suppose the typographers could offer
    some sort of polite, respectful advice to the programmers, who could then produce
    better designs for their employers. But typographers can't do miracles.\r\n\r\nIn
    this case, the miracle would be a display screen that fits in your pocket, and
    which is 8 1/2\" by 11\" in size. Maybe e-book readers already let people use
    landscape mode, though; that would clearly help a little.\r\n\r\nWhy, I've just
    had a creative idea that could improve Adobe Reader, at least. How about being
    able to choose a size smaller than \"fit width\", but which which pages down to
    the top of the next page when that is possible without missing text, even if it
    means moving down a bit less than a whole screen?\r\n\r\nEven <em>small</em> mercies

    12 to... don\u2019t remember, 14.5 to 15.25. \r\n\r\n<a target='_blank' href='http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/3691/screenshot20110513at255.png'><img

    am afraid that every other layout than variant D would just seem odd to a given
    random reader. \r\n\r\nVariant D has longer lines than any of the recommendations
    I read here, as far as I understood them. Variant D would be closest to how most
    people would treat a page in a word processor. \r\n\r\nVariant A has very small
    margins already. The line length would be in a good range. The general layout
    might be unexpected though for a \u2018random office document\u2019. With US-Letter
    the margins here could be bigger. I did not want to increase the margins more,
    as I thought the line length would be then too short. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
    What would be an appropriate layout that would not look odd to a random reader.
    Thanks\r\n\r\nP.S.: Typeface is Cycles Eleven, although I don't think it matters
    here. I am looking for recommendations suiting any serif typeface that is not
    as condensed as Times, any classical text face. \r\n"

  body: "I came across a comment in a fairly heated discussion about 'ideals' in typography
    on a [[http://www.pearsonified.com/2011/12/golden-ratio-typography.php#comment-185716|blog
    post]].\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nPeople look at 55 +- 10 as desirable because they
    believe it looks less assuming, and they think they can read it faster.\r\n\r\nWhat
    people think isn\u2019t always in line with the truth though\u2026\r\n\r\nIn reality,
    people read longer line lengths faster, thus making longer line lengths more optimal.\r\n\r\nThe
    trick is, you must start an article with a shorter line length so you get people
    to start reading your stuff. Then, you widen your content out so they can continue
    reading it as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n(You might think people will stop reading,
    but copywriters have long known that once you get people to read the first few
    sentences, they\u2019re more likely to finish what they started).\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere
    Derek presents some evidence from studies that conclude longer line lengths are
    actually quicker to read, \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201CLine length has also been
    found to affect reading rate on screen (Duchnicky & Kolers, 1983; Dyson & Kipping,
    1998). Both studies, although using different display technologies, found that
    longer line lengths (about 75 and 100 characters per line, respectively), were
    read faster than very short lines.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReading time was converted
    to words per minute. Results from a one-way within subjects ANOVA showed that
    there was a significant main effect of line length on reading speed, F (3, 57)
    = 3.45, p = .02, \u03B72 = .15. The 95 cpl (M = 178.82, SD = 41.83) articles were
    read significantly faster than any of the other line lengths (35 cpl M = 167.21,
    SD = 33.66; 55 cpl M = 167.38, SD = 33.96 ; 75 cpl M = 169.44, SD = 33.48) (Figure
    1).\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYoungman and Scharff (1999) used 12-point type and found
    that with no margins, when compared with 4 and 6 inch line lengths. Again, an
    8-inch line length elicited \uFFFC\uFFFCthe fastest overall reading speed. users
    preferred the 4-inch.\u201D\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThoughts, Typophiles?"

  body: "Thanks, can you give links? Generally speaking, typographers view the range
    of good line measure as dependent on vertical spacing, word spacing, and type
    face. The margins and how many columns are also a factor. The rule of thumb is
    two and a half lc alphabets for single column text, so in other words roughly
    65 average characters. This is both in Bringhurst's and Felici's guides to typography.
    \r\n\r\nAs I've recently found, the work of Luckiesh in the late '30s adds additional
    variables to reading speed as important, particularly, fatigue as measured by
    increase in blink rate. In his tests readers were less fatigued by shorter lines
    than the standard recommendation. So there may be a conflict between speed and
    ease of reading. Luckiesh also distinguished between natural, unhurried rate,
    and maximal rate. Again, these may point different directions as far as line length.
    Most work since Luckiesh has not been as revealing on these issues, as they tend
    to not include and control for enough important variables. (My and Peter Enneson's
    brief account of Luckiesh's work is [[http://typophile.com/node/83684|here on
    Typophile,]] and in the recent issue of Printing History.)"

    if they increase the possibility of going astray between lines.\r\n\r\nIf there
    is more leading, or paragraphs with fewer lines, that likelihood decreases.\r\n\r\nA
    page layout of really long lines, separated into three-line paragraphs, would,
    I predict, read very quickly. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the reader would pick up
    considerable speed along the straights, before going into the hairpins.\r\n\r\nPage-width
    decks of 100+ characters, three or four lines deep, are quite manageable."
