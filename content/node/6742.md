body: Im making a scrolling display in the street outside my house.. In London, there
  are these glass brick that are often set in the pavement.. I have put a bunch of
  LEDs under the glass bricks and have started doing trcks with them.. but the grid
  of blocks is 4 high &#40;by 16&#41; so fonts are really tough.. <BR>Does anyone
  know of a resource where i can see the most efficient way of making fonts with only
  four pixels high...? I supose I could turn the thing around and do 16 high &#40;by
  4&#41; but you would have to turn your head... Someone told me Wim Krause made one
  up at the beginning of computer time.. Any help would be greatfully received..  <BR>P.S  Check
  out the giant 3d sculpture I just made if youre interested.. <a href="http://www.greyworld.org"

  body: Andrew, brilliant work at the Stock Exchange!  <BR> <BR>I was recently introduced
    to that little Ambient Orb from MoMA&#39;s Design shop, which displays real-time
    information regarding stocks, weather, etc. Similar technology? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html"

    be in London soon, I&#39;m going to make a point to go see your sculpture. Where

  body: ': &#41; thanks a lot - quite different tech, actually, the spheres have 21
    moving parts, and get their data and power from the cables - its on telly every
    day, and closed to the general public, but if youd like to visit, ill sneak you
    in the back : &#41; Send me a mail and we can sort it out.. <BR>Any idea about
    a small 4 pixel high font? I suppose it would have to be lower and upper case,
    no?'

    look at atomicmedia.net. They have a lovely collection of pixel fonts. <BR> <BR><a
