body: "Can someone help me identify this font. I've looked everywhere and so that
  I don't have this problem in the future, what type of font classification does this
  really fall under and what type of serifs are these called? To me the font seems
  reminiscent of an art deco look and school/marker style, but I'm not sure of that
  either at this point.\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance you can give me. :)\r\n\r\n
