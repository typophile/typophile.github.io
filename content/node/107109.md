    samples]], I wasn't able to spot a match. Actually, can't find any font that could
    match all letters at the same time (main issue is with /[[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Au1KpsMCirs/UVow69HKJ-I/AAAAAAAAJW0/rkpQgX2pJws/s1600/Wine+of+Austria-27.jpg|G]]).
    Talking about /G, reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-unique|Gothic
    Unique WTF]]. The closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/industry|Industry
    HFF]] but still some details off: /G, only-top angled terminals... You may like

    from Moric reveals that the typeface is called Mexico. I don\u2019t know who designed
    it, but it is probably custom-made for the brand."

  body: "Thanks R. for the PDF link. I compared some letters from Mexico with other
    fonts and I agree with Ryuk that Industry is the closest.\r\nThis is a comparison
    of K and S, with Industry Demi in red and Mexico in black -- the caps heights
    of both fonts are standardized at 700:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IndustryDemiRedandMexicoBlackK_4997.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IndustryDemiRedandMexicoBlackS_5693.jpg]\r\nS
    is pretty close. K is the same design but wider. Other letters in Industry Demi
    are also wider. \r\nTo replicate the effect of Mexico the widths of Industry Demi
    \ would need to be adjusted. Also, as noted by Ryuk, the G needs to be redrawn.
    Other revisions as required.\r\nDon\r\n"

    using Google to find info but without success. Perhaps there is an ad agency or
    design house for Moric?\r\nDon"

  body: "Could be, don't know. But what I know for sure is many of (at least french)
    Chateaux and wine labels have their own printing house, designers and typefaces.\r\nOff
    topic, I like this Mexico font but I really don't think it fits the purpose. Even
    if I'm far from conservative and like (some touch of) modernism, mainly to rock
    the place, this one is really not of my taste for such an industry. Feels too
    much cold/industrial/pharmaceutical for a wine..."
