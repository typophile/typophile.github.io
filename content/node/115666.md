  am looking for the font face of the Word \" Bar \" & \"Courtyard\" .\r\nIf the font
  face of \"PEWS\" someone can suggest that is the surplus. \r\n\r\nI have tried my
  personal resources and was come near to \"Speculum (Regular)\"; which is definitely
  not the correct font face.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for helping or even looking. \r\n\r\nRegards,
  \r\nHash "
