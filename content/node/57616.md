  with no-nonsense geometric forms, effortless readablity at large sizes, and in-your-face
  poster thickness.\r\n\r\nI am working on a lightweight version of the face to contrast
  with this fat weight, but it is in a very rough stage as of yet.\r\n\r\nCriticism
  will be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buster1_6453.gif]"

    throughout the entire thing. Some characters are showing movement while others
    like T I F and Z are just straight. Of course, how you intend to use this would
    play a big part in how wild you want to go. '

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.\r\n\r\nThe font is intended mainly
    for use in headlines and on posters. I agree that the F looks too stiff right
    now. I may keep the I perfectly straight though, as the straight vertical lines
    provide an unwavering, authoritative quality to the design (I am inspired by fonts
    like Impact and Neutraface).\r\n\r\nI am thinking that perhaps I should ditch
    the perfectly straight horizontal upper-arms on the E,F,T, and Z and replace them
    with something a bit more lively and maybe include the perfectly straight versions
    as alternate characters.\r\n\r\nAnother concern of mine is that the L,O and T
    lack the thick/thin contrast that is so prominent in the Q,A,G,Y etc.\r\n\r\nIn
    regard to how wild I would like to go:\r\n\r\nIdeally all of the letters will
    be no wilder than the Y or G and no tamer than the H\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    from the \u201Cwildness\u201D) is that some of the weights of the glyphs are not
    consistant with others. JOLT is strong (bold). WAX is weak (medium to light).
    \r\n\r\nAs I said, just my thought... you get what you pay for.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from
