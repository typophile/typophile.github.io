  but I don't know the name of the font the other pages are using since the text is
  only contained in pictures. Can you help me finding the font name or tell me the
  name of similar fonts I could use ? Here are a few pictures where you can see the
  font :\r\n\r\nhttp://chic-et-delices.com/elements/entreprises.png\r\nhttp://chic-et-delices.com/elements/particuliers.png\r\nhttp://chic-et-delices.com/elements/contacts.png\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :) !\r\nBig_ben"
