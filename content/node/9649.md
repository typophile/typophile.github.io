body: 'I&#39;m doing the identity for an online school with a primarily spanish speaking
  target demographic. All printed materials will be entirely bilingual, so my first
  thought was to find an appropriate font by a native spanish foundry, on the premise
  that the ligatures and accents will be more appropriately integrated. &#40;This
  may be overkill, but it makes the font search more fun and gives me something extra
  to talk about with the client..&#41; <BR> <BR>Well, I looked at Letras Latinas and
  sudtipos, and Latinaires is a great font, not too many weights, though. Mr. Giacco
  is alright as well, but not entirely appropriate. <BR> <BR>And then I tried the
  logo in Auto 2 from underware and that is one hell of a font. It&#39;s quirky enough
  in italic to really set the company apart, but conservative enough to work well
  as a text font in its regular form. <BR> <BR>Klavika and Locator from processtypefoundry
  are nice too, but not quite as unique. <BR> <BR>So the question is two-fold: <BR>
  <BR>Am I making a mountain out of a molehill by limiting the search to spanish native
  type houses? <BR> <BR>If typophile thinks spanish designers are a reasonable starting
  point, can anyone recommend a slightly quirky, not at all clubby spanish speaking
  font that might be appropriate... <BR> <BR>The company is iLearn Institute so a
  really straight forward sans gets too close to iTunes iPod iEtc. for the clients
  legal department. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR> <BR>Isaac'
