    but it talks more about the original design development and it

  body: I&#39;ve collected a fair amount of print stuff about Times &#40;including
    some great pieces by Alan Hutt&#41;, but even though it&#39;s typically better
    than what&#39;s online there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything comprehensive out
    there even in print. Huh, I guess somebody should really write a book about the
    fatherly font that is Times! <BR> <BR>Maybe the most useful start would be if
    the Eye issue about Farey&#39;s work is available online - I know that some Eye
    articles end up on their site. A quick search there turned up these <BR><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=4&amp;fid=5"
    target="_blank">http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=4&amp;fid=5</a> <BR><a
    href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=4&amp;fid=11" target="_blank">http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=4&amp;fid=11</a>
    <BR>from the Summer of 2001 issue. But they seem to be just placeholders.  :-&#40;
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Both Dave Farey&#39;s design and Walter Tracy&#39;s <BR>&#62; Times
    Europa are completely new typefaces, <BR>&#62; not related to Times New Roman.
    <BR> <BR>Not to start a terminology battle, but I think the difference between
    Tracy&#39;s and Farey&#39;s stuff compared to the original is large - the latter
    is relatively pretty close, from my viewpoint. <BR> <BR>hhp
