  The font used in this image, from the Cloverfield teaser trailer:\r\nhttp://img301.imageshack.us/img301/1292/picture3my7.png\r\n\r\n3)
  The font used on this PDF. I'm not sure if it's the same as number 1:\r\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4971/picture4lx9.png\r\n\r\n4)
  The font used for people's posts on this board. Is it Times new roman? It looks
  different to me - softer.\r\n\r\n5) The font used on the main-page of this website
  and I think is the same one used to tell name of thread above this post:\r\nhttp://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8216/picture5ie0.png\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance.\r\n\r\nAdam."

    you get with the OS or with a MS application like Office, that's why Mac-Folks
    can see that also.\r\n\r\n>3) The font used on this PDF. \r\nDownload the PDF,
    check File/Properties/Fonts, normally you get there all infos about the embedded
    fonts."
