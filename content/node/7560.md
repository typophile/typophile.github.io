body: I&#39;m currently on a project, where the client has picked Zapfino as the headline
  font. When I started designing those headlines, I understood that I can not put
  them together quite as I like as I just don&#39;t get the right &#34;feeling&#34;
  of the typeface&#39;s flow yet. So I wanted to know if anyone has seen any good
  examples of its use - with alternates, ligs and all.

  body: 'Adam Twardoch has done more experimental work with Zapfino than anyone I
    know of. Since he had a hand in the programming and design of Zapfino, maybe he&#39;ll
    chime in with some better ideas. In the meantime, here is a link: <BR> <BR><a

  body: That is just beautiful. It certainly never looked like that when I tried to
    work with it. That is a demanding face. <BR> <BR>Well worth the work though, if
    you know what you&#39;re doing. &#40;I certainly don&#39;t.&#41;

  body: Below is an historically interesting settings of Zapfino. Historically interesting
    because I made it during production of the first AAT version of Zapfino, which
    shipped with the first release of Mac OS X. Between this version and the version
    that shipped with later releases of the operating system, Hermann Zapf redrew
    every single glyph in the font, working with Akira Kobayashi. So when we came
    to make the second version of the Zapfino AAT font, we were dealing with a completely
    new and very much improved design and some really lovely, clean outlines. The
    version in the illustration below is the earlier, less good version, but even
    it gives some sense, I think, of the kind of lively display setting that can be
    achieved with careful selection of alternate forms. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53233.gif"
