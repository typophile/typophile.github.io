  for the cropped pages--someone sent them to me who could not scan the whole sheet.
  These are Letraset sheets dated 1986 and the name of the face at bottom is Waldorf,
  designed by Freda Sack. Is this face in existence in digital format, maybe under
  a new name? Is it a revival of an earlier design? If so, from where and whom? Thanks
  for any info in advance."
