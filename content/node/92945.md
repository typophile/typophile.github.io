body: "I'm posting again, as I'm unsure to the font in the attached logo, used for
  GLOBAL. I'd ask the company, but they have no branding guidelines, no one to direct
  me to concerning the matter, and they indirectly told me they don't know it when
  they placed their order with me. Any thoughts? I was thinking maybe Eurostile or
  a relative, but I have to find and install it first.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nMy hunch
  was correct, and after finding the font for download, this post is null. Eurostile
  it was."
