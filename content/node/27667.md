  Morgan Quintet - Contemporary jazz and bebop.  Trumpet, saxophone, piano, bass and
  drums quintet.\r\n\r\nEnormous - Six piece indie pop band.  Described by Mojo magazine
  as \"mature song writing fused with horn rimmed pop with more hook lines than a
  slaughterhouse\".\r\n\r\nBig Arena Records - A small independent record label, an
  umbrella organisation through which the music of the above bands will be promoted
  and distributed.\r\n\r\nThe fonts will be used for everything from websites to printed
  flyers to CD covers. \r\n\r\nMy own initial thoughts are to go with something blue-note-esque
  for my quintet, a big heavy sans for Enormous, but I'm open to all ideas.  Thanks
  in advance for any advice or suggestions.\r\n"

    'big heavy sans' you are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the jazz quintet why not try
    a nice upbeat serif, maybe something like Dolly from underware.\r\n\r\nI'm not
    sure what to suggest for the record label, it all depends what sort of image you
    are trying to portray.  Have a look at emigre.com.  Something there might take
    your fancy.\r\n"

    good for Quintet.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/\r\n\r\nThe
    black could work for enormous, although it might be too predictable, maybe a light
    face?\r\n\r\nTim"
