  body: "Hi Marcus. There is some stuff on the Web, like <a href=\"http://grainedit.com/2008/06/17/aldo-novarese-recta-san-serif-typeface-for-nebiolo/\">this
    post on grainedit.com</a> that shows some pictures. I have a complete specimen
    back at my office but I\u2019m moving back to the UK tomorrow so I won\u2019t
    be able to access it any time soon. Lots of people have Nebiolo specimens these
    days, anyway. Recta is indeed a pretty big family modeled after Frutiger\u2019s
    Univers in the sense it has the same kind of rational system behind its weights/widths.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I know there aren\u2019t any available good digital versions. A guy called
    Derren Wilson <a href=\"http://www.iliveonyourvisits.com/?p=121\">posted to his
    blog a call to arms to digitise Recta in 2002</a>, then <a href=\"http://www.iliveonyourvisits.com/?p=180\">started
    doing it himself a couple of months later</a>, but as far as I know he never went
    further than what\u2019s posted there: lowercase, uppercase and numbers from a
    single weight with no italics and dodgy spacing, unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe biggest
    issue with reviving typefaces from Nebiolo is related to licensing anyway. In
    some cases it\u2019s easy to attribute the design to a single individual such
    as Novarese, but it\u2019s unclear wether the rights to some other designs belong
    to him (thus to his heirs) or to Nebiolo, or maybe to some other designer like
    Alessandro Butti or Giulio da Milano or\u2026 If they belong to Nebiolo, which
    closed in the 70\u2019s, as far as I know what was left of the company was sold
    to FIAT, Italy\u2019s main automobiles producer, but tracking exactly a contact
    to enquire about the rights to the Nebiolo stuff sounds like a nightmare in such
    a big organisation.\r\n\r\nNot all is lost though: there\u2019s a small group
    of people including me, Claudio Piccinini, Piero De Macchi, Enrico Tallone and
    others, who are actively researching Nebiolo\u2019s history so maybe things will
    become more clear in the future. When exactly I can\u2019t tell now, but that
    is my hope."

    in the last decade.\r\nGraphik typeface by Christian Swchartz are revival of German
    typefaces in the 19th\r\ncentury or early 20th century. That's why I asked for
    Recta, one of\r\nthe typefaces that inspired Christian in the design of Graphik
    as well\r\nas Plak by Paul Renner, Neuzeit Grotesk by Wilhelm Pischner, Folio
    and Maxima by Gert Wunderlich in Typoart foundry in RDA.\r\n\r\nI just found an
    article on Novarese in EMIGRE (no. 26 spring\r\n1993) and in Etapes n\xBA 13.
    \r\n\r\nIf you could send me some pictures about Recta you appreciate :)\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "<cite> Looks more like Avenir. </cite>\r\nYou are right Nick, in the sense
    that Recta appears a good compromise between Helvetica and Futura/Erbar. I always
    liked it because it's warmer, compared to Helvetica.\r\n\r\nMarcus: information,
    specifically on Recta, are not easy to find. They did not worry producing so much
    literature and analisys about type designs, they were more likely to proceed through
    work, and to concentrate on the work's results afterwards."
