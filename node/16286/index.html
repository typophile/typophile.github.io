  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi,

I've been playing with this logo for a few days. This is for a record label's web site. Right now, with how it is, it doesn't really click.

I was aiming for a russian/constructivist look with the bold usage of red and black, but i don't think the type serves this purpose. The typeface is Akzidenz Grotesk Bold, what do you think would fit in better?

Thanks</div>

Quick sketch...

I'd keep the Nick's suggestion for the proportion of the red and black color. However I think the type will be better if he would be separate one of the other and make it bigger and larger. Sans is a good choice but if your're not sure about that typeface try something else to see the look it will give. What do you think about that one:

		<div class="commentbody">If it's realy constructivist you want & it's a logo I suggest you get in somne books & make your own! They are fairly simple to make - but probably less simple to make REALLY well. Stil, an original solution for type in a logo is always a little more ideal because it catches the eye better. If you want a super fast solution there is always 'constructovist' from P22

The other thing is that so far you are giving me a swiss modern or post swiss feel not a constructivist one. They were big on wacky energtic angles and didn't go in for the degree of reductivism/simplicity you are using so far. Again, crack those books!

And lastly, they were big on using human figures even if they were pretty abstracted

But I like what you made too.

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the suggestions so far.

i think you're right about the proportions, but i have a thing for the horizantal stroke of the kk. i think they give the abstract/graphic kk feeling better.

i think my choice of typeface takes the whole feel of te design from consrtuctivist to minimal... i'll try to come up with a home-made face for the logo based on the suggestions of EbenSorkin. The way i see it, when i change the face i'll be able to be bolder with the kk icon.

One thing i found out is that the letter K is very  difficult to manage and tame.

btw, "Korkunc Kayitlar" is turkish and roughly means "Terrible Records", terrible with a double meaning, either scary or good as in "terribly good".

thanks for your time and suggestions, i'll post the updates.
