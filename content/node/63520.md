  the copy in word documents.\r\nThe thing is that the theater has always used italics
  when refering to titles, and sometimes there can be quite a few to say the least.
  I have tried different methods so far, but what are your prefered methods. I need
  all copy to take on a paragraph style while maintaining all italics??\r\n\r\nHope
  someone have some good tips."

  body: "Getting the text formatted into ID is one thing, making it stick is another.
    Tiff, your local overrides will show the dreaded '+' appended to these paragraphs,
    and if you ever do something like a search-and-replace using a paragraph style,
    they will all be flattened to its base definition.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way
    to make bold, italics, and so on \"sticky\" is by defining them as character styles.
    These won't disappear with an override; and you can easily change the definitions,
    for example, from bold to semi-bold, without touching anything else.\r\n\r\nReplacing
    every possible combination of text attributes with an appropriate style is a bore,
    especially since ID does not allow nesting of character styles (in particular,
    you might need a superscript, superscript italic, superscript bold, small caps
    italic, ... endless possibilities...). So I wrote a script to create them on the
    fly. It got mentioned on InDesignSecrets! Read (well, listen to) [[http://indesignsecrets.com/indesignsecrets-podcast-108.php|podcast
    108]] for all details."

  body: You are right, Theunis. But when your client doesn't really know what they
    are doing in Word and randomly starts playing with style sheets it makes such
    a huge mess that for me, in the long run, well I find it easier to deal with any
    mess in InDesign after the fact.

    with playlist dates, it has bullets to mark dates with different singers/actors,
    when imported all the bullets seemed to have disappered and doing a find/replace
    did not help much. I am listing to thr pod cast now, sounds interresting. Have
    you got a link for the script??"

  body: "@Tiffany\r\nThat is exactly what happens all the time. The manuscripts i
    recieve are most often full of copy/pasted variations of texts from a variety
    of sources. So far i have used to copy all text and paste it into txtwrangler,
    and then format everything from scratch, but now i need to create a faster workflow. "

  body: "Gregers,\r\n\r\nYour bullets disappearing happened because they were added
    in the paragraph style in Word. InDesign also allows bullets as part of paragraph
    styles, but if you override the style they will disappear. Not visible in Tiffany's
    screen shot (version?), but the Word options should also include sth like \"Convert
    Bullets and Numbering to Text\" -- use this if you don't use ID's own bulleted
    styles.\r\n\r\nThe script can be downloaded directly from [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/preptext.zip|my
    site]]. Unzip, copy into your Scripts folder. With a right-click on any script
    in your scripts panel you can select \"Reveal in Explorer/Finder\"; copy the script
    into there.\r\n\r\nA more recent podcast discusses various ways of cleaning up
    Word before/after importing -- well worth a listening as well."

    used it all this day. Takes a little time to get used to it, but have to say that
    it is just what ive been looking for. Its been such a pleasure to work with. Getting
    rid of all those ugly word format styles and what not. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNow ill
    check out this other podcast, and maybe try to teach the editors a bit of formating
    dicipline. :-)"

  body: "You are welcome :-)\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Discipline:\r\n\r\nBefore I
    run my own script, I always check first what the Find Fonts list says. The script
    doesn't behave properly if a font's styles are not called plain \"Bold\" or \"Italic\"
    -- it'll fail miserably on \"Light Italic\", \"56 Italic\", \"Bold Condensed\",
    and such. I replace those fonts with Times New Roman analogs. It also lets me
    check up on mis-used Symbol (since most fonts I use have their own Greek characters)
    and kill off any stray Wingdings arrows.\r\nAnd <em>then</em> I'm just starting!
    Next is to check each and every possible text attribute for mis-use -- I hate
    superscript spaces in the middle of a regular paragraph, italics that include
    its trailing space, paragraph returns that are formatted with bold and underline,
    less-than with an underline standing in for less-or-equal, plus with an underline
    posing as plus-minus.\r\n\r\nCleanliness ... Oh, and then I run my script."
