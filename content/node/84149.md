  \ All I have on this pc they are having me use is standard windows typefaces.  BORING!
  \ The problem?  How do I choose a typeface that's both appealing to the target market
  and not be overused?\r\n\r\nLuckily the financial industry is stagnant (in terms
  of design) so there's no where to go but up, so I ask of you fine members of Typophile,
  which two typefaces would you choose for the layout attached?  Preferably one serif
  and one sans, but I'll take anything.  I'm really at a loss here. :(\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dve_5297.png]"

    thrown <strong>out</strong> for inappropriate behavior.\r\nThe stagnation you
    refer to is a natural conservatism* on the part of institutions looking after
    other people's money.\r\n\r\n*Well, that's the vibe the want to give, even while
    experimenting with volatile financial derivatives.\r\n\r\nBut it's always struck
    me as ironic that Garamond italic is considered conservative, given the crazy
    Baroque (Bringhurst's category) angles of its construction."
