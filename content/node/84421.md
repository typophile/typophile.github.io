  about Green Building certification. I was looking for a header and a body text font
  that express an organicity, a link to the natural world. Can't be too earthy, though
  -- my audience will be mostly blue collar manufacturers. Thank you, and I look forward
  to learning more about typography from all of you.  Best, Daniel"
