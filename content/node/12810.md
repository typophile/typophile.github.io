body: "Hello,\r\nI am working on a CD layout. All of the songs are in English except
  for one that is in Japanese. I'd like to use <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11189.0.0\">FF
  Info Text</a> for the layout but I'm not sure if there's a Japanese font that goes
  well with it. I'm willing to change to another sans-serif if a smooth combination
  is known.\r\nI'd be very appreciative if anyone has links or information on this
  question.\r\nThank you kindly!"
