  This made me wonder, have typographers also used small caps for mathematics? I was
  thinking this could make uppercase variables stand out less from the surrounding
  text when they are discussed. Does anyone have thoughts about wether or not this
  is a good idea, or perhaps links to some resources about the subject? <BR> <BR>Torgeir'

    -- upper case, italic, bold, script, fraktur, &#34;blackboard bold&#34;, etc.
    -- have established conventional associations. And, perhaps more important that
    their specific associations, they are used to make distinctions: <i>s</i> and
    <i>S</i> are different things, and setting the latter as a small cap would render
    a piece practically unreadable.'
