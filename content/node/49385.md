  are [[Hebrew]] Type Design specimens from Mr. Raphael Frank's important little book
  on Hebrew type designs and its history, printed originally in German, and translated
  later into Hebrew. An English translation doesn't yet exist. His ideas and opinions
  are quoted in my English language book on Hebrew Typography.\r\n\r\nFrank's contribution
  to Hebrew type design was significant and influenced Jewish culture due to its enormous
  impact upon modern Jewish and Israeli societies. These samples include rarely used
  examples of different type style designs, demonstrating his intense love and knowledge
  of Hebrew type design.\r\n\r\nFrank designed and created the popular standard FrankReuhl
  type style. No other type design has been used to a greater extent for the Hebrew
  language in the twentieth century and beyond. In the eighteenth and nineteeth centuries,
  the Merubaas typeface, and its derivatives, were the book publishing stand typeface.
  Since then, it was replaced by FrankReuhl. Over the past fifty years, Hadasa, David,
  and Narkiss, have attempted to upsupt FrankReuhl's dominance and have failed."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/meruba_5199.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first
    type specimen is called \"Meruba\", which means in Hebrew, square. This is not
    the common name associated for this design. \r\n\r\nWhy then did Frank refer to
    this design as \"Meruba\"?\r\n\r\n\"Meruba\" is both a very old and yet also a
    relatively recent design. Many hand-drawn books from hundreds of years ago appear
    with this typeface design, usually to present Biblical material.\r\n\r\nRelatively
    recently, the huge Romm family printing establishments in Vilna, Lithuania standardized
    their print jobs upon a version of this typeface design. Their popular printing
    of the Talmud for over a hundred years used it. Hundreds of other Torah books,
    including those of great Chassidic masters, used it. And even hundreds of non-Torah
    books of literature, poetry, Hebrew grammar, children's primers, and secular thought,
    used it as well.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why this design style is referred
    to as \"Merubah\", or square.\r\n\r\nFirst, the dimensions of the design is very
    wide and square-like. This is conducive to accurate reading, good comprehension,
    and overall clarity.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the design in some ways is comparable to the
    type design of the style used in the Sefer Torah scroll. In fact, many laws are
    derived from aspects of the \"Merubah\" design that would invalidate the Sefer
    Torah scroll style of lettering.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is actually associated
    with all non-script Hebrew type designs, and not necessarily to the \"Merubah\"
    design. Here, the choice of the word \"Merubah\" simply means \"block letter\".\r\n\r\nIt
    is unlikely that Frank refered to this design because of the second reason. Clearly,
    the first reason accurately describes the most important aspect of the \"Merubah\"
    design, and seems to be the basis of Frank's intention.\r\n"

    new bold FrankReuhl design.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/franksamp_4236.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere
    are two examples of the popular standard Hebrew design, created by Frank.\r\n\r\nThe
    top one, in regular and bold weights, is the most like the original design, with
    certain differences. A radical change was introduced by Varityper, a now extinct
    photo-typestting firm, later purchased by Agfa(-Compugraphic). \r\n\r\nThe type
    design was later revived for desktop publishing as an early Hebrew PostScript
    font by FontWorld, the leader in software products for professional typesetting
    of non-Latin laguages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. \r\n\r\nRecently, an early pioneer
    in desktop publishing software for foriegn languages, Linquists' Software, created
    an OpenType version for use in Biblical Publishing of a scholarly nature, in Micrsoft
    Word for Windows. It was incompatible with Adobe InDesign CS/3 ME.\r\n\r\nAnother
    example popular in Hebrew desktop publishing is Apple's New Pnimim, another knock-off
    of FrankReuhl. New Pnimim is based upon (Merganthaler-)Linotype's version of FrankReuhl.
    It contained many design differencs, depending upon the needs of metal type, which
    were varied besad upon the point size used.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/npsamp_5536.jpg]"

  body: "If we look carefully at these two designs, we can ask, what is different
    about them to cause such an upheaval in the Jewish printing industry?\r\n\r\nFirst,
    the proportions are very different. The \"Romm\" design is much wider than Frank's.
    This means, practically speaking, many more words per line typeset using FrankReuhl
    will fit in a given space. This is very economical to printers.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, Romm is very wide, almost squarish. The letters are thicker. The results
    are much more conducive to repeated study.\r\n\r\nA sofer, Hebrew scribe, once
    explained the advantage of the Romm typeface. \"It has round soft edges,\" he
    said. \"I know what it means to look at letters for a long time. The design of
    this typeface is easy on the eyes. You can look at it forever, and yours never
    feel strain.\"\r\n\r\nRomm was designed for Bible and Talmud study, and the like.
    The prayerbook is typset in Romm. The Passover Hagada is typeset in Romm.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Frank lived, the Jewish world was abandoning traditional Jewish study, and going
    away from use of books typeset in Romm. Frank's design fit a gap, a need in Jewish
    society, that was different, and reformed of tradition. We see today that most
    secular literatures, newspapers, even pornographic writing use FrankReuhl.\r\n\r\nThis
    has been the norm for over fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe question is, with a revival
    called desktop publish, and a new font format excellantly geared for Biblical
    Hebrew, called OpenType, will the Romm design regain its status of dominance,
    particularly if multiple weights and widths of it appear to meet the needs of
    Jewish publishers today."

    patterning it after motifs he took from very old Ashkenazic and Sephardic letter
    forms, and those of Bomberg and Soncino.\r\n\r\nGoHebrew's Henri is a faithful
    rendition of Hadasa, approved by Mr. Friedlander before he died. Another version
    was drawn for the Israeli distributor of Esselte/Letraset products. Very recently,
    a third design was designed by FontBit, called New Hadasa. Also, John Hudson's
    Adobe Hebrew was inspired in part by Hadasa.\r\n\r\nThe very popular ArtScroll
    Orthodox Jewish publishing house based in Brooklyn uses Hadasa exclusively for
    its books. Mr. Friedlaender cried when he learned that the Bible today is studied

    is true. \r\n\r\nTo peruse text swiftly, comprehension is certained enhanced.
    Perhaps, that is the main reason for its popularity and longevity.\r\n\r\nThe
    wide Romm design nevertheless is preferred for lengthy concentrated study. Rabbi
    Akiva Eiger zatzal even strongly endorsed the Romm family efforts to produce the
    Talmud over the previous publishers of Slovita, causing a decade long batter over
    which publisher has exclusive rights.\r\n\r\nRabbi Eiger cited that study would
    enhanced with this typeface, and for that reason it was justified to replace the
    publishers of Slavita.\r\n\r\nToday, new renditions of the Talmud are being produced,
    with the effort of Oz VeHadar leading the pact, followed by Zundel Berman Books.
    A third effort is being made by the Moznayim/Vagshall publishing house, for this
    very large market. \r\n\r\nA fourth competitor is GoHebrew, whose near-identical
    version of the Romm and Rashi typefaces seeks to invoke Rabbi Eiger's ruling and
    capture the entire market.\r\n\r\nThe goal of GoHebrew is to remake the entire
    library of Jewish classics, with an English translation, too."

    He was retired. I spoke to him only on the phone. Out of respect, I never called
    him by his first name, nor did ever even refer to himself, by his first name or
    last.\r\n\r\nI remember 3 things in particular:\r\na) He cried when I mentioned
    that much of Orthodox world was studying Tanach, the Bible, in his Hadasa typeface;\r\nthis
    caused him great satisfaction to know this. (We spoke in Hebrew, so he was apparently
    unaware of ArtScroll.)\r\nb) He approved my interpretation of Hadasa as authentic;\r\nc)
    He criticized one detail in a few letters, urged me to correct them, and added
    this was the secret of good Hebrew fonts.\r\n\r\nThe story how we spoke on the
    telephone was really amazing. I had just married and created a PostScript version
    of his Hadasa design for a very early system of Apple Macintosh operating system,
    when the IBM PC just began. It was System 5.\r\n\r\nAnticipating to license it
    to Apple Israel, I sent Mr. Friedlaender a check for 100 old shekels. He return
    the check to me, explaning that he sold the rights to a now-defunct small European
    type foundry many many years ago. Hence, he was not entitled to any money. I was
    very impressed with his honesty.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Mr. Friedlaender called
    me in Kfar Chabad. He said that \"I noticed from the address that you live Kfar
    Chabad. Kfar Chabad is village which is inhabited with the followers of the Lubavitcher
    Rebbe.\" I replied, praised his work, extolled his important role in Jewish history,
    and added that the ArtScroll Orthodox publishing house in the United States had
    standardized their books on Hadasa. Then, I told him that even the Tanach, the
    Bible, appeared in Hadasa, and studied every day by many many Jews around the
    world.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Friedlaender was silent, and I heard him weeping like a baby."

    Type Designs, like its name. The first post begins with Mr. Raphael Frank a\"h,
    desiugner of FranReuhl.\r\n\r\nFrankReuhl is the first main topic. To appreciate
    its position as the premiere Hebrew typeface design, I compare it to the Merubah
    typeface design. Merubah means square.\r\nThis design was popularized in many
    other forms, particular by the Romm family of Vilna, Lithuania. \r\n\r\nThe Romm
    family printing establishments were reknown for very high quality workmanship.
    Even though they were very modern Jews, Chassidic masters sought for their books
    to be produced by the Widow and Brothers Romm.\r\n\r\nIn order of popularity,
    I move on to David, Hadasa and the rest.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you add important
    details about Aharoni and Hadasa. I was unaware of this. In Israel, during the
    eighties, many popular Israeli newspapers used Aharoni for headlines, and Aharoni
    Tzar, its narrow look-a-like, for headlines of minor articles.\r\n\r\nI don't
    read Hebrew, except to pray or study, or read fascinating articles about Hebrew
    Type Design. Perhaps, another black typeface design is used, like Chaim Shamen,
    Fat Chaim.\r\n\r\nI would be interested to read, as I am sure many others, for
    you to post a summary of Friedlaender's article in German, and an overview of
    facts that you know.\r\n\r\nHe sold the Hadasa design I think to the Amsterdam
    Typefoundry.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, I read that he used the Hadasa design to be carved
    in an Israeli building. The book even included his picture, the building, and
    a picture of the short inscription. I never said that he made it for that purpose.\r\n\r\nHow
    is Drogolin in any way similar to Hadasa? Look, I have samples above. When I first
    saw Drogolin, I thought it was an attempt to capture the flair of Romm/Vilna.
    FontWorld called Drogolin by th name of Belz, because the Belz logo featured Drogolin.
    \r\n\r\nActually, the font called Margoliot is not really Drogolin. Drogolin had
    a peculian curl on the lower left side of the aleph, and this version cuts it
    out.\r\n\r\nDavid, you are a treasurechest of knowledge Hebrew type design. Please
    don't keep it to yourself. Share your knowledge with us, and post, post, post..."

    A knock off is an imitation of a popular design, simply with a different name,
    to avoid payment to its designer or copyright/trademark owner.\r\n\r\nHe cited
    the example of Tzvika Rosenberg, a popular Israeli font-maker, of MasterFont,
    who created Apple's Raanana. I called it a \"knock-off\". The bold version is
    a really poor knock-off.\r\n\r\nI called it a knock-off because when it was first
    created and licensed to Apple Israel, the unrelated name, Raanana, a small city
    in Israel, was picked to avoid payment to Mr. Itamar David, in the early eighties.\r\n\r\nDavid
    wondered why I did not call FontWorld's version, King David, also a knock-off,
    like Tzvika's Raanana. It's a valid question.\r\n\r\nFirst, King David is not
    a \"knock-off\". It is a very carefully rendition, inspired by Mr. David's popular
    design. It is rendered not to divert from hiis designintentions, but to correct
    his design flaws.\r\n\r\nThe real differance is in appearance. \r\n\r\nRaanana
    is a little, thinner, narrower, and not equally weighted in its strokes. Look
    at how David is different. Its strokes are weighted equally, making reproduction
    at even small point sizes looking right, while the same text, at the same point
    sizes, does not look right.\r\n\r\nKing David captures David's flow, but adds
    a unique touch, like raising a bit the height of the lamed, or raising the top
    of the left hand lower stem of the gimmel to increase its clarity and legibility,
    or the lowering of the top of the detached stroke on left hand side of the kuf,
    to allow better distinction and \"breathing room\".\r\n\r\nFontWorld never issued
    Itamar David a\"h any royalty out of \"moral good sense\" in the nineties, as
    it had no way to contact him (he was an invalid either living in an age hold or
    with a child in America). If anyone knows how to contact his descendants, please

    have cpmparables.\r\n\r\nApparently, Frank made his design to typeset large Biblical
    texts, or Hadagas. The other venders aim were rabbinic commentaries, or political
    discussions, or literature in general, that appears at smaller text sizes, or
    even have very small footnotes.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple weights which I have
    from Linotype, 9, 10, and 12 point sizes. Vaityper's version is even lighter,
    and very suitable for small text sizes. We don't find a 18 pt. or 24 pt. FrankReuhl
    from Linotype.\r\n\r\nEach one (the 9, 10, and 12 point sizes of Linotype's FrankReuhl)
    is very different from its siblings. 9 in particulars has major differences. \r\n\r\nI
    also has from a very old job a revival of FrankReuhl from an artist commissioned
    to draw very large letters from an unknown machine. There also an interesting
    design that is unique to all other versions of FrankReuhl from other venders,
    except one of the 3 point sizes from Linotype (the nine) [maybe, it was drawn
    from the nine].\r\n\r\nI also have another set of drawings that I was told was
    drawn from an old Linotype machine, where Frankruehl is somewhat crossed in design
    with Romm. I haven't revived it yet.\r\n\r\nIn these two versions (Linotype's
    9, and the very large drawings) the bottom of the right side is lifted off (in
    part) from the baseline. It looks like a person standing upon his toes, with his
    heel lifted off the ground.\r\n\r\nI debated whether I should include this detail.
    A professor at RIT (Rochester Istitute of Technology, a leader om printing technology
    and type design studies) suggested that this peculiarity in design was like the
    design of serifs, to allow ink to gather during the print process. He reasoned
    that sonce this was no longer an issye, I should abandon thos aspect of the design.\r\n\r\nI
    was unsure, so I left it in the Varityper revival. Later, I found ot only in the
    small 9 point aleph of FrankReuhl from Linotype.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the professor
    was correct, but his conclusion in my view was not. What do you think?\r\n\r\n[My

  body: "Israel, I got hold of a Biblical grammar book, so I understand better now
    what David has been saying with regard to your idea of 'automating' the setting
    of the kamatz ketan and shva na, as you discussed in the other thread. This thread
    seems to be 'live', so I'll post here. \r\n\r\nThe grammar book is by a Chinese
    guy, but it corresponds exactly to what David was writing, so I'm assuming it's
    solid. It's called \"Grammar for Biblical Hebrew\" by C.L. Seow. \r\n\r\nSo the
    rule for the kamatz katan--which he calls a kamatz chataf--is simple: if it's
    in a closed syllable, then the kamatz is a kamatz katan, and otherwise not. This
    David wrote, and followed the rule with a 'smiley'. \r\n\r\nNow I understand the
    'smiley', because the rule leads you into a whole chain of questions. \r\n\r\nHow
    do you know whether it's an closed syllable? Simple, it ends with a consonant
    that has a schva nach under it, or is the last letter.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you know
    whether it's a schva nach or schva na? Well, now you get a bunch of rules, one
    of which is that it's a schva na if comes after a letter with a strong dagesh.\r\n\r\nSo
    how do you know whether it's a strong or weak dagesh? Well, one of the rules is
    that it's a strong dagesh if it's preceded by a short vowel. \r\n\r\nSo how do
    you know whether it's a short or long vowel?  \r\n\r\nWell up till now I will
    probably forget all this, but a computer won't, so there's no problem programming
    it, I would guess. \r\n\r\nBut here is the kicker: you only tell whether it's
    a short or long vowel by whether it falls on an accented syllable. \r\n\r\nSo
    you've hit a brick wall if you are only looking at syntax, because nothing in
    the letters or nikud are going to tell you where accent is. (David mentioned the
    accent issue also.)\r\n\r\nTo know the where accent is you are going to have to
    have a 'look up' of the word in some kind of dictionary that will tell you where
    the accent lies. \r\n\r\nSo it looks to me like what you need is not open type
    programming to do what you want, but rather some kind of 'spell check' that will
    automatically put the kind of nikkud you want. That you could do with the look-ups.
    I know that one of the Hebrew typing programs already has 'auto-nikud', but I
    don't know whether they will distinguish a kamatz katan and the different kinds
    of schva. But I don't see why they couldn't do it in principle.\r\n\r\nSo with
    a kind of spell checker which you would run or would be active all the time, it
    seems you could do what you want. But not by just sticking to the sequence of
    letters. \r\n\r\nps. Oops I left out that the cantillation marks for Torah writings--taamei
    hamikra--might change where the accent is, according to what David wrote. That
    might force you to look at more than on word, but presumably a spell check program
    could do that in principle. \r\n\r\nWhether it's worth the effort is another question.
    \r\n\r\npps. This book says that a kamatz katan is sometimes indicated by putting
    a meteg next to the kamatz. That seems to me typographically better than the line
    above the letter, or a bigger kamatz. However, I read somewhere that in the Siddur
    the meteg multiplied like measles so nobody really knows what they mean. So I
    don't know. "

    seems kinda dire for programming it onto OpenType, as OT needs to substitute a

    mark serves two functions with two names: meteg and siluq. Meteg is a vocalisation
    mark used to indicate secondary stress. Siluq is a cantillation mark signifying
    the end of a Biblical verse. Since the marks are visually identical but semantically
    distinguishable by context, Unicode unifies their encoding as a single mark.\r\n\r\nIt
    is the nature of chant -- not only Jewish chant but also Byzantine chant and the
    varieties of Latin chant -- that melody arises out of text. This means that it
    isn't really possible to talk about cantillation independent of vocalisation;
    so, for instance, the marking of secondary stress using meteg has a musical function
    that derives from the musical function of syllable stress as a punctuating and
    rhythmic principle. Or, as Joshua R. Jacobson puts it: 'Where there are too many
    consecutive unaccented syllables, the rhythm of the chant may sound rushed. Accordingly,
    to slow down the pace of the reading, a secondary stress is often indicated on
    words with more than two syllables.... A syllable with a meteg should be chanted
    <em>slightly</em> louder and longer than a syllable that has no accent at all.'\r\n\r\nJacobson's

    you can distinguish siluq from meteg is that siluq will always be followed by
    a sof pasuq. Siluq always occurs on the last word of a verse, so if you see what
    looks like a meteg on the last word, it will actually be a siluq unless there
    is another accent. [There are a few cases of polysyllabic words that have both
    a meteg and a siluq; the latter, of course, is the one nearest to the end of the
    word.] The siluq is specifically a cantillation mark: it indicates a melodic ending
    to be sung.\r\n\r\n<em>Accoording to your definition of meteg, how then is a secondary
    stress indicated?</em>\r\n\r\nBy a meteg. In the cantillation system, the meteg
    is used to indicate secondary stress. Primary stress is indicated by one of the
    other accents -- which one depends on the melody --, but where a number of unaccented
    syllables follow in succession, the meteg is used to signify a secondary stress,
    which musically is a rhythmic device.\r\n\r\n[Note that I only know about Biblical
    Hebrew. I don't know how stress works in normal spoken Hebrew or understand what
    role meteg plays in the vocalisation system other than in cantillated text.]\r\n\r\nAgain,

    of music to text and hence to the characteristics of spoken language, particularly
    stress, which performs a rhythmic role in both speech and chant. So yes, there
    is a relationship between the ta'amim and the nikudot, <em>but</em> -- and this
    is important -- vowels are the most fluid elements of language. They are fluid
    in their individual and regional interpretation and they are also historically
    fluid (consider the 'great vowel shift' in mediaeval English). So what the nikudot
    signify is something less fixed than either the consonant letters or the ta'amim.
    Note also that what the ta'amim signify is also changeable, although in a different
    way: how particular accents are interpreted by the cantor depends on the calendar,
    the same mark will be expressed musically in different ways depending on the text
    and the holy day. Historically, the ta'amim have also been given different melodies
    in different diaspora communities. Jacobson has a nice example of the intersection
    of these phenomena on page 16, where he shows six different melodic interpretations
    of the ta'am tevir -- respectively for Torah, Haftarah, Esther, Lamentations,
    the Song of Songs, and Torah on a High Holiday -- in a Lithuanian tradition.\r\n\r\n<em>The
    typeface design is Stam.</em>\r\n\r\nBetter to say that Stam is a typeface in
    the style of this (probably 18th century) Ashkenazic formal writing."

    mountain to climb\u201D: you want to have a special mark e.g. floating asterisk
    above the sheva na, right? But EVERY hataf is sheva na: hataf segol, hataf patah,
    hataf qamats.\r\n\r\nI am a very pragmatic businessperson in matters of type design.
    A graphic symbol over a letter with a shva to indicate to the reader is an accepted
    practice by two of the largest Jewish publishers in the world. So I want my fonts
    to support it.\r\n\r\nA graphic symbol over a letter with a hataf katan, hataf
    patach, and hataf segol, is not an accepted practice by any Jewish publishers.
    So I could care less, of the hataf part is a shvana or just a couple of dots...\r\n\r\nThis
    is primarily a business decision.\r\n\r\nI am a professional with very high standards,
    so I want to become an expert in Hebrew grammar. I am also a thinker of lofty
    concepts, so I seek to understand how letters, nikkud, taamim, taggim, music are
    interrelated.\r\n\r\nAbout William's warning about the maskilim who excelled in
    Hebrew grammar, my role model is the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe. When he was a
    young boy, his parents hired secular tutors to teach him mathematics, Hebrew grammar,
    and other topics not studied in yeshiva. I am interested though in reviewing these
    same rules in the writings of the Rishonim (the early redactors of Jewish law),
    as I understand that all rules are derived from their writings.\r\n\r\n.\r\nMichael,\r\n\r\nThank

    In Biblical text, is the meteg indicating this?</em>\r\n\r\nIt is chanted <em>and</em>
    it is indicating (secondary) stress. Stress is part of chant.\r\n\r\nWhat I am
    not sure about is how this chant stress -- and hence this use of meteg -- relates
    to stress in spoken Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>How does the reader know its a meteg
    or a silug, if they occurs at the end of a verse? All they both repeated?\r\n\r\nDoes
    SBL-Hebrew have a double meteg by itself, a double meteg with each nikkud, a double
    meteg with each taam, anda double meteg with each nikkud and combination?</em>\r\n\r\nThere
    is no situation in the Bible text where meteg and siluq fall on the same <em>syllable</em>.
    There are cases where they fall on the same word, but always on separate syllables.
    So there is no need for a 'double meteg' combination.\r\n\r\nThink of is this
    way:\r\n\r\nThe cantor is studying the vocalised and accented text (obviously
    he needs to do this prior to the service, because the synagogue scrolls do not
    contain the nikudot or ta'amim; he has to practice ahead of time and do it from
    memory). He sees this little vertical mark which he knows has particular musical
    significance. In the midst of a verse it indicates secondary stress, which he
    will sing slightly louder and longer than a syllable that has no accent. At the
    end of a verse it indicates a final cadence, typically of two or three notes depending
    on the word. [Note also that the cadence for siluq varies when the verse is the
    final one in the reading.]\r\n\r\nSo the terms meteg and siluq do not refer to
    distinct marks, per se, but to different interpretations of the same mark in different
    contexts."

    (p.430)\r\n\r\n<em>\u2022 The symbols for meteg and siluk look identical.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Siluk marks the last word in a verse. In most books it is followed by the sof-pasuk

    Meteg is a secondary accent: it will never appear alone on a word without that
    word's primary accent. The primary accent is placed on the stressed syllable.
    Meteg indicates a secondary word stress, usually two syllables before the primary
    stress.</em>\r\n\r\nJacobson provides examples of both meteg and siluq.\r\n\r\nFrom
    these rules it follows that:\r\n\r\nif you see a word with only the meteg/siluq
    mark, and no other ta'am, then it must be siluq;\r\n\r\nif you see a word with
    the meteg/siluq mark on one syllable but another accent on a later syllable, then
    it must be meteg;\r\n\r\nsiluq is the sign used as a primary accent;\r\n\r\nergo,
    if a word has two occurences of the sign then the first must be meteg and the
    second must be siluq."

    understood as part of that overall system. However, it is unique among the accents

    the nikudot vocalisation.\r\n\r\nI'm only familiar with the Biblical text, so
    I don't know how meteg is used independently of the full cantillation system,

    comments that it represents 'stress', which doesn't really convey much: what kind
    of stress? in what circumstances?). What I am fairly sure of though is that this

    the cantillation system (as described above).\r\n\r\nHere, for reference, is Gesenius'
    explication of the meteg accent (2nd English edition, based on 28th German edition,

  body: "Thanks for the clarifications, David.\r\n\r\nHow does one sing without melody?
    The answer to that depends on how one defines melody. If one assumes melody to
    include changes in tone, i.e. pitch variation, and not just changes in duration
    (rhythm), then such 'singing without melody' would be what is called recto tono
    in Latin chant. This is a very simple style of chant that is rythmic but does
    not involve pitch variation; it is used for e.g. the liturgical confiteor (confession)
    and certain prayers, and can also be used, as a fallback, if one isn't accomplished
    enough to sing the proper melody for e.g. an antiphon.\r\n\r\nJacobson's description
    of the interpretation of meteg in Jewish chant indicates that the reciting tone
    is maintained: the syllable with meteg is lengthened and sung slightly louder,
    but the pitch does not change. So the role of meteg is rhythmic rather than melodic
    in the sense used in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nThere is a much more general
    definition of melody, though: 'interacting patterns of changing events occurring
    in time.' And in that case merely rhythmic changes could be interpreted as 'melody',
    although I wonder how many lay-listeners would consider the results melodic."

    or even see your distinction. Please explain.\r\n\r\nAre you referring to a totally
    different typeface design, known as: \"Sefer Torah Sans Script\"? I implemented
    it without the taggim, as I was instructed by the Chief Rabbi of Crown Heights,
    Brooklyn. He feared that the font would be misused, and suggested this alternative.\r\n\r\nThe
    font, \"STaM\", which I uploaded earlier is not used to write an actual Sefer
    Torah scroll, Tefillin, or Mezuzah. Rather, religious writings about Torah topics
    or actual Tanach texts are typesey using this font style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/STSS_S_3417.jpg]\r\n"

    the image I uploaded is not a typeface at all: it is handwritten, which was my
    point in saying that it would make more sense to say that the Stam Regular type
    you showed is in the style of the earlier writing, rather than the other way around.\r\n\r\nThe
    second point is that the Stam Regular font, despite the name, is not actual STaM
    lettering: i.e. '<em>not</em> an implementation of the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules'.
    It is a style of letter that has associations with religious texts, and hence
    can be used to evoke these associations, but the shapes of the letters differ
    from those of real STaM. Hence I find the name of the typeface confusing."

    are from font software. \r\n\r\nOne of my samples is just like that which is used
    by sofer STaM, a Hebrew scribe of STaM, to compose by quill a Sefer Torah parchment
    (which is later sewed together), 5 parchments for Tefillin, and one small parchment
    for a Mezuzah. This is a font, without the taggim, the ornaments on top of some
    the letters. The scribe hand draws the letters according to different rules. the
    Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules are actually very old. Maimonides discussed then as
    well. Halacha authorities debate how to both correctly draw certain letters and
    at the same time incorporate ideas discussed in Jewish mystical writing, to evoke
    these ideas while wearing the Tefillin.\r\n\r\nI do not understand your repeated
    reference to the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules. They pertain to the Sefer Torah Scroll
    Sans letter shapes, but with the taggim. These rules do not pertain to the font
    called, \"Stam\".\r\n\r\nI agree that the sample handwriting is not Stam. Rather,
    it resembles the typeface called Stam, but preceded it by many hundreds of years
    (?) .\r\n\r\nDo you have other samples of old Hebrew handwriting?\r\n\r\nThe other
    one of my samples is the Stam font, used as a typesetting font by some people
    for some religious writings. There is no rule here to follow. The religious writings
    could be in FrankReuhl or Henri.\r\n\r\nStam was simply selected as a name, as
    you say, to evoke a religious feeling. Nowadays, few typesetters use Stam at all.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "David, I don't think you misunderstood Hrant's question. But perhaps for
    clarity we should talk in terms of left-slant and right-slant rather than forward-
    and back-slant, since the latter terms are relative and the former are absolute.
    For further clarity, left-slant is defined as having the top of a stroke being
    to the left of the bottom \\, and right-slant as having the top to the right of
    the bottom /.\r\n\r\nSo Hrant was asking about right-slanted letters in Hebrew,
    and wondering whether Hebrew readers mind this.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, there
    remains some debate about the 'correct' direction of slant for Hebrew 'italics'.
    I seem to recall that Zvi Narkiss decided that the letters should slant to the
    left. I see that Masterfont offer a number of families with options, i.e. secondary
    fonts with left- and right-slant, so that users can select which they prefer (but
    presumably one is treated is default 'italic' style and associated with the italic
    text function in apps).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I never use Hebrew 'italics', but if
    I were to I think the decision about slant direction would depend on a number
    of factors. When asked to make italic versions of Adobe Hebrew -- primarily for
    technical reasons -- I decided that, given the target users of that family, facilitation
    of bilingual text was the most important factor. So Adobe Hebrew Italic has a
    right-slant to harmonise with the Latin italic. Apart from other considerations,
    this decision avoids the very problematic situation that arises from common punctuation
    characters, shared by both scripts, needing left-slant variants that may or may
    not be accessed by applications. [Adobe Arabic Italic has a left-slant, and there
    are environments in which the punctuation variants for Latin do not work, so you
    end up with right-slant Latin italic letters with left-slant punctuation. Ack!]\r\n\r\nWhile
    I agree with David that the impulse to right-slant Hebrew 'italics' in modern
    typographic practice probably originates from copying Latin -- for either stylistic
    or technical reasons --, my palaeography books show lots of examples of Hebrew
    writing with a right-slant, as well as examples with a left-slant. In both cases,
    the slant appears to be a result of writing speed, as with the development of
    the Latin italic, and the direction is more likely the result of the writing habits
    of the individual scribe than a conscious stylistic development. There are, of
    course, plenty of people whose Latin-script handwriting slants to the left, but
    this never translated into normal typographic use."

    is from central Italy, from a document dated 1433, now in the Biblioth\xE8que
    nationale, Paris. The same document also shows a more formal, upright writing
    in the larger size.\r\n\r\nThis example is instructive, I think, because one can
    see how such a slant would develop very naturally from writing quickly, with the
    down-strokes made quickly, with a flick. If you consider that the hand will be
    moving on, to the left, to begin writing the next letter, a flick in this direction
    on the down-stroke is much more natural than a movement to the right to produce
    a left-slanted letter. [This also accounts for the characteristic exit stroke
    of Latin italics: a flick up and to the right toward the starting point of the

  body: "The truth is that any handwriting, script-like, or italic, typeface design
    can incline to the right or to the left. There seemingly is nothing in the design
    that requires the slant to be one way or the other? Is there?\r\n\r\nA few years
    ago, I created a set of fonts with joining letters to teach children to form letters
    correctly, to write with a clear handwriting. \r\n\r\nIn one font, the alphabet
    appeared with each letter form separate, to show a child how the letter by itself
    is supposed to look. In a second font, the alphabet appeared with each letter
    form joined to the next letter to show a child how the letters together are supposed
    to look (this was very difficult as letters join each other differently, and there
    was no OpenType yet to address these different situations). In a third font, the
    alphabet appeared with each letter form joined to the next letter to show a child
    how the letters together are supposed to look, but very small arrows were added
    to each letter, to indicate how each letter should be correctly formed.\r\n\r\nMost
    left-to-right languages, like English, have letters formed clockwise, while most
    right-to-left languages, like Hebrew, have letters formed counter-clockwise. However,
    slant plays no role in being determined by the rotation of the formation of a
    language's letters. Rather, the direction of eye movement is the determining factor.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why a right inclined letter is inappropriate for Hebrew, because eye movement
    is leftwards. In this incorrect case, the stress on one's eye movement in increased
    continously because of the letter's slant.\r\n\r\nOn John's example, I believe
    the very old beautiful Hebrew handwriting was likely from a right-handed person,
    as Rashi observes that most people write with their right hand. In writing Hebrew,
    the hand must be held somewhat awkward, as the arm covers the written text; hence,
    right slanted text is easier for the hand to form, due to the somewhat awkward
    position off the hand. A left-handed person has an easier time holding the pen
    to write Hebrew, by to produce right slanted text is easier than producing left
    slanted text.\r\n\r\nI think that this correct. What does everyone else think?"

    But the only benefit for left-handers is that their hand does not obscure what

    construction of the flag is one of the style indicators, but it must be checked
    against other features of the individual typeface or writing hand: there are other
    features, such as the baseline shape of shin and related forms, that are probably
    more significant. I must also point out that I have not looked at as many Ashkenazic
    exemplars as Sephardic, so can't say for sure what variety of flag forms might
    be found in that style.\r\n\r\nIn Sephardic styles, there are two basic constructions
    for the flag: a single stroke down to the right and then curving to the left,
    and a returning stroke down to the right and then doubling back and down to the
    left. What is important is the construction pattern, rather than the resulting
    shape, which can be misleading in some cases. This is why I think you are misclassifying
    Adobe Hebrew as Ashkenazic. If you look at the construction of the aleph flag
    in Adobe Hebrew, the returning construction is evident. So although the flag shape
    is much more horizontal than in the traditional Sephardic styles, the stroke construction
    is derived from the Sephardic model. And, of course, if you look at the bottom
    of the shin, samekh, etc., these are very clearly Sephardic forms."

    for \"to cry\", \"liv'coat\". \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vayave_k_3602.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\nThe
    first two letters of the 3 letter root are each veis, the second letter of the
    Hebrew alphabet. Seemingly, the third letter of the 3 root letters, hei, falls
    away, in this case, and is represented by a dagesh point in the second letter
    of the 3 letter root, the final chaf. (Perhaps, the dagesh point is representative
    of an indirect pronoun, referring to the cheek upon which Joseph cried). So, a
    shva appears below, and a dagesh above it.\r\n\r\nI wonder what makes this Hebrew
    text \"from some Karaite tanakh\". \r\n\r\nI know the Christian Bible and the
    traditional Jewish tanach has some minor differences, mainly in the nikkud and
    taamim. \r\n\r\nThere two versions of the traditional Jewish tanach. In one version
    the hei and the end of a word appears which is logical, grammatically correct,
    and to be expected. In the other version, accepted by the Chassidic groups, the
    hei is replaced with an aleph, which is illogical, seemingly grammatically incorrect,
    and not to be expected. \r\n\r\nHowever, in one of the oldest copies of a Sefer
    Torah scroll, which existed in the famed Maharal of Prague's synagogue, the oldest
    standing synagogue until Nazis destroyed it, in a certain word an aleph appeared
    at its conclusion and not a hei. This would indicate that the Chassidic tradition
    is correct, since it has historical verification.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jewish mystical
    texts, this difference is more than just scholarly. The entire Five Books of Moses
    (Chumash) spells out G-d's name. The entire text, from the first letter, an aleph,
    until the last, a lamed, and all the letters in between, is precise. So, it's
    meaningful and significant whether it's an aleph or whether it's a hei.\r\n\r\n\r\n*
    \  *   *\r\n\r\nIf you notice, in my sample, both the dagesh and the shva is lifted
    up above the baseline. This is for purely aesthetic purposes, as having the dagesh
    lifted up, and the shva below, a large gap if white space exists between then,
    plus when taam and meteg appear, there is very little room to place them, plus
    there is a blatant inconsistency between the occurrence when no dagesh appears
    and when a dagesh appears."

    doesn't refer to anything in this context, since there is no single Hebrew text
    recognised as finally authoritative. Rather there are a few different lines of
    approach to the Jewish scriptures in Christianity:\r\n\r\nThe Greek Orthodox (and
    presumably Eastern Catholic) Churches still use the Septuagint (LXX) text, i.e.
    the Greek translation prepared by Jewish scholars in Alexandria, between the 3rd
    and 1st Centuries BC, and which was used by Jewish communities during the Hellenistic
    period. After the destruction of the Temple, rabbinical tradition restored the
    Hebrew version and established the Palestine canon, excising those books of the
    Septuagint for which Hebrew texts were not available.\r\n\r\nThe Septuagint is
    also the basis of the Slavonic, Armenian, Syro-Hexeplar, and Coptic versions.\r\n\r\nFollowing
    use of Latin tanslations from the Septuagint, the Roman Catholic Church in the
    late 4th Century adopted Saint Jerome's Latin version translated directly from
    Hebrew texts. A few years ago, Pope John Paul II announced that new Catholic translations
    would take into account the latest scholarship of the earliest surviving Hebrew
    texts found at Qumran.\r\n\r\nToday, almost all scholars studying the Hebrew scriptures

    the surviving Ben Asher manuscripts, the most complete of which is the Codex Leningradensis
    and the oldest of which is the Aleppo Codex. These Masoretic manuscripts are the
    oldest standard texts containing nikudot and ta'amim. Pre-masoretic texts are
    largely unvocalised and without cantillation. The Masoretes standardised the vocalisation
    and cantillation. The consonant text of different versions shows very little variations
    -- testimony to how carefully it was transmitted --: even the very oldest surviving
    texts, found at Qumran, are almost identical to that preserved in the Masoretic
    texts from a thousand years later."

    is a good example for use of a stylistic alternative, and shin kubutz ayin patach
    combination of a contextual replacement.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the ayin changes
    from the form where part of it dips below the baseline, and is replaced a different
    ayin with the form which remains above the baseline, to make room for the patach.\r\n\r\nIn
    the second more complicated case, the patach itself is repositioned according

    I am pointing out design traits. John, if I understand him correctly, is emphasizing
    the use of the medium to compose. In the comparison below, the issue of design
    traits appears the main factor, as these designs are \"full\", and are not reflective
    of the stroke movements associated with composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aleph_compison_5182.jpg]\r\n"

    re Raanana; Hadasa re Henri; Koren re Crown; Narkis Tam ne Neshika (inspired Ariel
    Hebrew)?\r\n\r\nLet's take Hadasa, for example.\r\n\r\nMany foundries have created
    near-faithful versions or adaptations of Hadasa, either called Hadasa, Hadas,
    or New Hadasa. Each one was a little different than Friedlaender's original design.
    FontBit's New Hadasa is a lot different.\r\n\r\nFontWorld's Queen Esther and GoHebrew's
    Henri stayed faithful to the original design. To preserve the designer's original
    intent, this then is a \"faithful original\". Henri Friedlaender himself saw FontWorld's
    predecessor, Otzar Haoht's Esther, and commented: \"This is the closest to the
    original to date.\" This was after Linotype, IBM and others attempted to offer
    their versions.\r\n\r\nA modification, even where the design is changed to comply
    with accepted design principals, is similar, a close interpretation, or even a
    poor knock-off, is not faithful.\r\n\r\nA revival, for better or worst, is a new
    popularization of a dormant design.\r\n\r\nTake \"Romm\" for example. In the 1800's
    it was the most popular and most used Hebrew type design, until \"FrankReuhl\"
    tooks its crown. In the mid and late 1900's, \"Room\" disappeared. If one could
    say kaddish and keep yahrzeit for a type design, we'd be making it a yahrzeit
    every year.\r\n\r\nGoHebrew's faithful rendition of this design of the Romm family
    of Vilna, Lithuania is in deed also revival.\r\n\r\nTo stick 100% to the original
    design, and to suppress any creative innovative urges, no matter how good, requires
    tremendous self-discipline and dedication.\r\n\r\nAre we speaking the same language
    now?"

    wonder if he was the Minchas Shai (a great expert opinion on Hebrew grammar and
    definition of a shva-na), for his name may be an acronym for Shai.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the Radak (Rabbi David Kimchi), Ibn Ezra and Gaon of Vilna, these were much greater
    scholars that the the Minchas Shai.\r\n\r\nHowever, Shay Lemorah cites that his
    editorial decisions regarding the shva-na are based upon the views of the early
    Rishonim (Ibn Ezra was in deed a Rishon, as was the Radak) and the Minchas Shai).
    \r\n\r\nThe Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Eliyahu, was fairly recent, about nine generations
    ago. He is a widely accepted scholar, highly respected for his broad knowledge,
    but he promoted opinions based upon his own analysis of the Talmud, in opposition
    to the views of great Rishonim before him, an attitude greatly frowned upon by
    the Rebbes of Lubavitch. \r\n\r\nFor example, a left-handed Jewish male must put
    the arm-tefillin upon his right arm, whereas most Jewish men, who are right-handed,
    must put them on their left arm.\r\n\r\nWhat consitutes left-handedness? Is your
    stronger arm the arm you throw with (brute power), or write with (intellectual
    dominance)?\r\n\r\nUntil the Vilna Gaon, the major redactors of Jewish law concluded
    that the hand you write with belongs to the stronger hand. The Vilna Gaon disagrees,
    based upon his understanding of the Talmud, contradicting sages greater than him.\r\n\r\nRabbi
    Shneur Zalman, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe, and his replacements, strongly opposed
    the Vilna Gaon's ruling. I was fortunate to show how the Vilna Gaon erred by citing
    an Talmudic explanation from Rabbi Shneur Zalman's younger brother, the Maharil.\r\n\r\nAnother
    example in in the perception of the universe according to the teach ancient Jewish
    mystical literature (very similar to recent discoveries in modern physics). Rabbi
    Shneur Zalman explained the Baal Shem Tov's understanding of the holy Arizal's
    teachings. The Vilna Gaon's opposed this understanding, and promoted an alternative
    view.\r\n\r\nToday, we only have one perception of the G-d's precence in the universe,
    based upon Rabbi Shneur Zalman's explanation of the Baal Shem Tov's understanding
    of Arizal's teachings. No one understands anymore what the Vilna Gaon was trying
    to express (indicative that it did not make sense)."

  body: "Michel,\r\n\r\nFrom your example and your recent postings, you appear to
    be focused upon the issue of automatic nikkud via an OpenType font, which I proposed
    may be a feature of a \"smart\" OpenType font of the future.\r\n\r\nTruly, in
    a peripheral and wishful thought, I think it's possible. You clearly do not.\r\n\r\nI
    wasn't going to put my focus upon it at this time, until after I knew OpenType's
    GSUB and database capabilities, and the intracasies of Hebrew grammar, both much
    better and first hand (which I don't yet).\r\n\r\nIn my stubbornness, I still
    (perhaps, naively) think incorporating it into OpenType is possible. \r\n\r\nAs
    I understand it, the dictionary/spell-checker look-up is to correct the error
    factor of the software. Meaning, the algorythm in the software performs the job
    with an error ratio, and the spell checker's purpose is to correct these errors.\r\n\r\nAt
    first glance at your examples, the difference in spelling seems only contextual.
    When one spelling follows after a type of word, eg. \u05DB\u05D9, the string (the
    spelling is with a tsere) is one way, but if it's following a different type,
    eg. not \u05DB\u05D9, the string is not this way.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that
    a wildcard and a qualification table would address this, eg. if the string is
    such and such, with various wildcards, and it is not such and such, with various
    wildcards, then it should be replaced as such and such.\r\n\r\nYour examples convince
    me that OpenType can achieve this (although there may be some percentage of inaccuracy,
    as there is no spell-checker).\r\n\r\nAgain, my immediate goal is not auto-nikkud
    or auto-taam or auto-meteg. These are lofty goals.\r\n\r\nRather, my immediate
    goal is a set of algorythms to automate replacement of certain shvas with shva-na,
    of certain kamatzes with kamataz gadols, and certain kamatz gadols with hataf
    kamatz gadols.\r\n\r\nFirst, I want to see if they are doable, and if they are,
    can it be processed in a reasonable amount of time."

    finite, and the computer has no problem in remembering what is what. And, as Michel
    points out, there is anyway sometimes ambiguity as to what word is meant, when

    grammar, which I found on Google Books]], p. 50 on the \"shewa\", it is clear
    that the distinction between the shva na and nach--i.e., when the shva is voiced
    and not, was never really clear. \r\n\r\nAnd in modern Hebrew the shva is generally
    pronounced when it is grammatically significant, and otherwise generally not,
    unless it is really a tongue-twister. Thus 'bracha', blessing, and not 'beracha',
    but \"berosh hashanah\", on rosh hashanah, and not \"brosh hashanah\". And what
    may be tongue-twisters for non-natives, like 'gdolah' (big) instead of 'gedolah'
    is utterly unproblematic for native speakers. \r\n\r\nAll of this leads me to
    a philosophical issue. In the Tanach itself, since scholars argue about how exactly
    to interpret the combination of nikkud and ta'amei hamikra, whether to introduce
    distinctions not already existing in the Tiberian system them seems an editorial
    decision--which scholar are you going to follow?\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to the
    Siddur, the prayer book, it seems to me the better path is just to follow modern
    Hebrew, if you are going to specially label the shva na and kamatz katan. After
    all, Hebrew is now, thanks to God and the Israelis, a living language, and we
    don't know how it was pronounced in the days of Isaiah or whomever. \r\n\r\n"

    to make professional typeface software. \r\n\r\nThe newest standard industry font
    format is OpenType, as you know. In addition to basic typographical features,
    such as: outline font definitions, unification of Adobe PostScript and Microsoft/Adobe
    TrueType font formats, Unicode support (and double byte characters), OpenType
    also offers very sophisticated placement of diacritic marks, and intelligent replacement
    of complex strings of glyphs.\r\n\r\nI seek to include use of these features in
    the professional typeface software which I create, so they have a competitive
    advantage over other manufacturer's products.\r\n\r\nSecond, most users do not
    know of or understand many rules of Hebrew grammar. Hence, an automatic replacement
    and positioning feature is useful both to use Hebrew grammar correctly without
    its complete knowledge, and to learn their intricasies easily (by simply turning
    OpenType off and on at will in Adobe InDesign ME CS/2,3,4 ad beyond).\r\n\r\nThird,
    Hebrew text is available for most everything imaginable, except newly written
    materials. By including these glyphs and including an automatic replacement and
    positioning feature, this existing text can be easily modified prior to viewing
    or printing by simply using the professional typeface software which I create.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
    may not be possible to accomplish everything mentioned, or even a small  part
    of it. But the advantages that result from success warrant a valiant effort, as
    our sages obm promise: \"Yagata umatzata, ta'amin\" \"effort finds success\".

    Noam Chomsky--concludes: \r\n\r\n\"Both the historical evidence and actual usage
    seem to point to the conclusion that the rules about the vocal and silent shewa
    in our grammatical texts and taught to our pupils are either superfluous or unfounded.\"\r\n\r\nThese
    arcane rules were invented or divined by David Kimhi (~1160-1235 CE). Before this
    the description of use of the shva na was that it occured at the first letter
    of a word, the second of two letters with shva under them, or with two identical
    consonents. That's it. And as far as any Hebrew as actually spoken--either ashkenazi
    or sfaradi--the use of the shva na on the first letter of a word is actually restricted
    to the 'liquid consonants', ylmnr (yod, lamed, mem, nun, resh) and the prefixed
    prepositions and conjunctive vav. The actual rules of spoken Hebrew seem to me
    as logical and natural as the Kimhi rules seem arcane and impossible. \r\n\r\nThe
    rules David Kimhi invented were then taken up by other pedants--er, grammarians--both
    Jewish and Christian. And they are now used to torture Israeli high school kids,
    who then proceed to immediately and \"consistently ignore these rules in their
    normal conversation... This is the fate of all artificial and non-functional rules
    or learning.\"\r\n\r\nMy conclusion about transliteration is that the best way
    to go is not to follow \"scientific\" rules, which are based on the Kimhi grammar,
    but rather those of modern Hebrew, which in all likelihood have held sway for
    a very long time, if not always.\r\n\r\nps. Looking again at Israel's project
    of getting a special mark for kamatz katan and shva na to substitute from syntax
    only, I've got a new take. I see in Seow's grammar that it is \"rare\" that a
    syllable ending with a final letter or letter with a shva under it is \"open\".
    That means that you would rarely go wrong with an automatic substitution of a
    kamatz katan for a kamatz in such situations. So this could be done. Also you
    could automate from syntax the simple rules of spoken Hebrew for the shva na.
    But to automate the Kimhi rules from syntax alone--forget about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of those on one word). Rarely doesn't mean never, and if you want to be able to
    reliably typeset the Bible text then you can't rely on mechanisms that sometimes
    get it wrong, no matter how rarely this happens."

    First, there is no Unicode value for shva-na, though there should be. Second,
    data for all Biblical and most post-Biblical literature is already made, without
    these characters. Hence, a font-based solution is not intended to be a substitute

    even Moses never heard.\r\n\r\nWilliam,\r\n\r\nLet me clarify something that you
    seem to miss even after your continued study.\r\n\r\nIn Chabad, a person's personal
    observance is relative to his or her knowledge and environment, but less essential
    than the very core of the person. \r\n\r\nThat's why the Chabad leader could declare
    the success of the Entebbe Raid was a miracle, of Biblical proportions. The first
    Satmar leader zatzal rejected the notion that G-d could do a miracle for a non-observant
    Jew.\r\n\r\nSo, if a scholar is less observant, his scholarship is not rejected,
    because his or her very core is still intact.\r\n\r\nMaimpnides rules that if
    a Jew not only rejects his or her heritage intentionally, but also causes other
    Jews to go astray, his or her teshuva is in deed rejected, and his or her scholarship
    is burned. One can not even warm himself by the fire.\r\n\r\nMaimonides also rules
    that if a Jewish child is captured and raised as a non-Jew, his or her status
    is unique. One may not rebuke such a person, but rather encourage him or her to
    return to the practice of Judaism.\r\n\r\nThe seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe contraversively
    ruled that our entire generations falls now in this last category. For even the
    most astute Torah scholar was raised with a neo-Christian Western mentality, and
    no longers lives in accord with Jewish practices and thought from generations
    ago."

    Firstly, the article on Masorah in Encyclopedia Judaica was a bugger to typeset.
    It took me close to 50 hours!\r\n\r\nRegarding make a smart font for kamatz katan
    and shva na. Ignoring whether this should be done or not, frankly it's irrelevant
    for 2 reasons: \r\n\r\n1) Ashkenazic masora is different from the Sefardi masora
    (tradition) for these grammatical nuances so for example in the Hebrew word for
    \"afternoon\", the first kamatz is gadol according to Ashkenazim and katan according
    to Sefardim. So what you going to do? Create a font for each tradition? Also,
    I don't think you understand the enormity of the task. Let me give you an example:
    The word Yevarekhkha in the Priestly Blessing. Notice how I've written it as a
    shva nach (and not how many siddurim incorrectly put it as shva na)? This is because
    this prayer is a biblical indictment and therefore has to be pronounced according
    the rules at the time and the rule to make it a shva na came a long time later.
    Same too with the word Ata. Notice how in siddurim a meteg (in this case the meteg
    indicating mileil and not a secondary stress taam meteg or a sof pasuk which some
    of you are calling a siluq which is a primary stress regardless of milra or mileil),
    is put in this word sometimes to stress it as Ata rather than aTA because that
    part of the prayer was from the time of the Rishonim which again had different
    grammatical rules. What I'm trying to say that in a siddur the rules of pronunciation
    change according to the period. In our proofreading of the new Koren Siddur for
    the USA (with translation and commentary in English), a team of 3 grammarians
    and rabbis have spent months and months checking the correct pronunciation with
    the meteg, the shva na and kamatz katan. Encoding it into Opentype would be a
    monumental task even if you could agree to one halakhic authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)
    I seriously doubt the Volt could actually compile the font. \r\n\r\nWe are currently
    working on the Koren Tanakh font which has kerning and correct positioning of
    the teamim and we have got the point where VOLT cannot compile the font and we
    haven't finished all the taamey mikra collisions yet. We'll optimise the font
    more and hopefully will manage, but if we had to put in the rules for taamey mikra
    then VOLT would have a fit."

    keep all diacritics, including nikkud, on the same level.\r\n\r\nSome change the
    weight of the nikkud, taam, and meteg, too. I don't think Koren did this.\r\n\r\nShva-na
    is vital, as words do change meaning because of some shva-nas, and pronunciation
    of course changes.\r\n\r\nToday, most Askenazic Jews use Sephardic pronunciation,
    so kamatz katan is essential to pronounce prayers accurately. Askenazim who maintain
    tradition, and prnounce according to their tradition also benefit from kamatz
    katan for a few reasons, though our Jewish leaders chose not to emphasize it.
    This attitude is changing.\r\n\r\nHence, the new Koren Bible text would be negligent
    if it lacked them, particularly if other products offer it. Furthermore, instead
    of marching forward, neglecting them would be a step backward."

  body: "Firstly to answer you question about placement. Koren placed each nikud and
    each ta'am very deliberately. Because all the nikud and ta'amim were manually
    placed he wasn't limited by technology. The preference was that the nikud didn't
    move and the ta'am was put in the correct position next to it. If it was possible
    to solve a collision problem by moving the nikud before and after only slightly
    then this was done, if not then the ta'am was moved vertically downwards (of course
    this is only a major problem on lower ta'amim).\r\n\r\nYes the weight of the ta'amim
    are lighter than that of the nikud. Of course the same glyph is used for both
    the meteg and the sof pasuk and in both cases this is a ta'am. In the siddur we
    treat it as nikud I guess because it has a special meaning different of the meteg
    and the sof pasuk (I'm not even going to talk about ga'ayas and other stress marks).\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of VOLT, you misunderstood what I said. Of course we are programming in
    a kamatz katan and shva na (and a shva nach too), however, you should know that
    when programming a font, the font has to be compiled. If there are too many lines
    in the code, the compiler cannot compile. At the moment the Koren Tanakh font
    with kerning, ta'amim collision preventing etc is too long and cannot be compiled.
    That means that the past 50 instructions that I have given to the programmer for
    collision avoiding cannot be put into the font. The programmer is now optimising
    the code so that it takes up less space and can be compiled.\r\n\r\nI mention
    this because if you want a font to have grammar rules built-in it will take up
    even more lines of code and you won't be able to compile your font. Now to be
    fair, Koren is a special case typeface because it's very narrow, very very tightly
    kerned and therefore there are many more collisions then a typeface such as Hadasa.
    \r\n\r\nRegarding pronunciation, I think you have got quite confused between pronunciation
    and masora.\r\n\r\nTraditionally the Ashkenazi Jews had their system of pronunciation
    of vowels where eg a kamatz is an \"o\" sound and Sefardim had their pronunciation
    system where a kamatz is an \"a\" sound. However, we need to differentiate between
    a pronunciation system and grammatical system.\r\n\r\nI will attempt to explain
    and hopefully it won't get too confusing.\r\n\r\nIn Israel all Israelis, both
    Charedi Ashkenazim and Secular Sefardim pronounce spoken Hebrew in a system called
    \"Israel pronunciation\". That means that in the street everyone speaks more or
    less the same (I'm ignoring old-timer sefardim that will still pronounce the ayin
    and the chet).\r\n\r\nHowever, those same Charedim will prayer using the Ashkenazic
    pronounciation system. Okay so far.\r\n\r\nNow let's take a look at the kamatz
    katan. Ashkenazim of 300 years ago pronounced a kamatz katan and a kamatz gadol
    in the same way. There was no audible distinction. It sounded the same. The Sin
    and Samech was the same too etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, grammatically, just because they
    pronounced the chet the same as the chaf, it didn't mean that they only had one
    letter. It just sounded the same. Grammatically Ashkenazim had a kamatz katan
    and a kamatz gadol but since it was written the same and spoken the same it wasn't
    necessarily something that a kid in cheder (sunday school) would know about.\r\n\r\nNow,
    as we know the sefardim did distinguish audibly between the kamatz katan and kamatz
    gadol. In fact they also distinguish between the chet and the chaf, the ayin and
    the alef etc. Therefore the concept of a kamatz katan not only is known to sefardim
    but is also somehow indicated in their siddurim for pronuncation purposes.\r\n\r\nOkay,
    this much we all know. But here is the kicker: the determination of what is a
    kamatz katan is different in the Ashkenazic tradition to that of the Sefardic
    tradition. The example that I gave above of the word for \"afternoon\" \u05E6\u05D4\u05E8\u05D9\u05D9\u05DD
    in hebrew. According to the Sefardic tradition the first kamatz is a kamatz gadol
    and according to Ashkenazic tradition (and incidentally according to the modern
    Israeli rules of pronunciation) the first kamatz is a kamatz katan. This is regardless
    of your pronunciation system. This is a grammatical determination.\r\n\r\nNow
    this creates a question for somebody like myself publishing a siddur. Clearly
    when creating a sefardi siddur then the kamatz katan should be according to their
    traditions, ie tzahorayim (afternoon), but what about for an Ashkenazic siddur
    where the majority of users are going to be using modern Israeli pronunciation.
    \r\n\r\nThe decision in Koren was to use Ashkenazic rulings of the determination
    of kamatz katan in our nusach ashkenaz and sefard (not to be confused with sefardi)
    siddurim and the Sefardic rulings for our Edot Mizrach siddur. We will be using
    the Morrocon rulings for our Morrocon siddur and Yemenite for our Yemite siddur.
    \r\n\r\nNow what do you about a Bible? Which system do you use? After all, the
    Bible is for everybody. Honestly I don't know! \r\n\r\nHowever, we will most likely
    do 3 editions, one for Ashkenazim, one for Sefardim and an edition that has neither
    (like we have today) which will serve clients such as the army that the users
    are both Ashkenazi and Sefardi. However, the jury is out on that one!\r\n\r\nOne
    final comment. When digitising the font we had a problem with the shva na. The
    enlarged shva that we created wasn't distinct enough from the regular shva. We
    couldn't make it any larger because we felt it would look silly, so instead we
    created a further character, a shva nach which was smaller than our shva so that
    it was distinguishable from the shva na character. Therefore our font has 3 shvas.
    A regular shva to be used when distinction isn't made and when we are marking
    it, then a shva na and a shva nach!\r\n\r\nYou are invited to see a sneak preview
    of the new siddur. www.korenpub.com. Click on the bottom middle icon. The new
    English site is still in development so we still have our old (and quite awful
    website) for Koren :-)\r\n\r\nBTW the siddur pages were created with InDesign

    nikud is the correct one or the only one. You just can't do that. Do you have

    took 10 years to proofread. We are now in the midst of digitisation and expect

    roll, and I've seen some synogogues that have them, as it was once in use here
    as well.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the haftorah was read, because Torah reading was banned.
    Haftorah is from the various books of Prophets, known as Nevi'im. That's why certain
    Haftorah verses mimick themes in the weekly Torah portion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is
    a third approach to avoid colliding which is extremely attractive, and automatic.\r\n\r\nScott-Martin
    Kesofsky created very slightly wider versions of the narrow letters, and slightly
    narrower nikkud, thinner and thus even narrower taam, and a very thin meteg in
    his Milon typeface. The differences are very subtle, that only a good typographer
    with a keen eye could notice.\r\n\r\nI have not seen a better living Hebrew typesetter
    than him (you're very good, but he's superb). I told Scott that it's because that
    he caters to the high end, like you (but his high end is much higher!), while
    I have customers that think use of white space is a waste of paper, and good typography
    is \"cram it in\"."

    system.\r\n\r\nTraditional means that the nikkud/taam/meteg combination is viewed
    as a single unit, and centered under the letter, unless that letter is a daled,
    kuf, or reish.\r\n\r\nModern means only the nikkud is centered. The nikkud is
    dominant in weight and width, the taam is secondary, and the meteg is thinner
    than the taam and positioned on a lower level than it.\r\n\r\nThe modern approach
    poses difficulties under narrow letters, especially followed by a reish (or someyimes
    daled).\r\n\r\nThere is a great advantage in teach children to read by following

    approach though is most popular in America and by many, if not most, frum Jews.

    taam should be positioned on the nikkud's left, and be thinner, and positioned
    a little lower than the nikkud.\r\n\r\nThe meteg should be positioned on the taam's
    left, and be thinner, and positioned a little lower than the taam.\r\n\r\nI think
    the insertion of a slice of space is preferred to juggling the taam etc. The consistant
    order of the nikkud, taam, and meteg, is more important that the fac that letters

    am using kerning to make sure that the nun and the yud are closer together etc.\r\n\r\n3.
    I respect your opinion of adding thin spaces between the letters instead of moving
    the taamim, however, I believe that this is coming from a programmer's point of
    view and not a typographer's. After all, why do we have fi and ffi ligatures?
    Why didn't we just add a thin slice of space in between? I think it decreases
    legibility.\r\n\r\n4. Again, I'm not convinced about the narrower versions either
    for the same reason, but I am more open to that option.\r\n\r\n5. I will most
    certainly not tell Harbs anything of the sort. You clearly have no idea who he
    is, what his relationship with Adobe is and what his relationship with HaKadosh
    Baruch Hu is (lehavdil). I request that you keep such comments off this forum,
    they are highly inappropiate.\r\n\r\n6. Yes you are very confused about the meteg
    on all levels. I'm not sure how you are programming it if you don't understand
    it. I will explain briefly, because I have explained it already on this thread,
    if you need more information e-mail me off-list.\r\n\r\na. The meteg is a taam.
    It's purpose is secondary stress. It has the same weight as all other taamim.
    It is not secondary to the taamim. It is a taam.\r\n\r\nb. The sof pasuk (siluk)
    is a taam. It's purpose is primary stress. It also has the same weight as all
    the other taamim.\r\n\r\nc. The visual appearance of both these taamim are exactly
    the same even though they have a completely different purpose. In Unicode, they
    also have the exact same value (although IMHO this is incorrect).\r\n\r\nd. For
    100s of years, the meteg has been \"incorrectly\" used in Siddurim to indicate
    primary stress on a word that is not accented on the last syllable. This is known
    grammatically as \"mileil\" as opposed to \"milra\". The thinking was that we
    tell the reader to pronounce all words as milra (ie stress on last syllable) unless
    we put a meteg under a different syllable. Eg MElekh. Here there would be a meteg
    under the first syllable. However, the only time that a meteg would appear under
    the first syllable in the Tanakh, would be if it was the last word in the sentence,
    ie a sof pasuk. In this situation, the weight of the meteg has no consequence
    since it isn't part of the Hebrew grammar but rather a made up sign. It's like
    saying that a kamatz katan should be heavier than a kamatz gadol. It's nonsense.
    We only make the kamatz katan larger as an educutional tool. Therefore you might
    as well keep the meteg used in this situation as the weight of the meteg of the
    taamey mikra and then you can use the same unicode character. I should point out
    that in Rinat Yisrael, they use a zarka for words that are commonly mispronounced
    as mileil and an ole for words commonly mispronounced as milra. There they don't
    use a meteg at all.\r\n\r\nI hope this clears a few things up."

    you are right, and I am wrong. If that is true, then not only do I owe you an
    apology and must ask you forgiveness, but I should also declare here in this forum,
    in \"public\" my error and your validity.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe though this
    is not incorrect. I'll tell you why:\r\n\r\n1. No distributor or reseller has
    the right to infringe upon another authorirized distributor's or reseller's territory.
    Are you a VAR (Value Added Reseller)? This seems not true, as the plug-ins you
    sell are priced very low, and they are only a non-essential add-on feature, not
    an essential componant of the InDesign ME software.\r\n\r\nAt Apple Computer Inc.,
    I had an arrangement in writing with Apple as a VAR. However, even there I was
    obligated to compensate the local reseller for every sale. Why would this logical
    arrangement be rescinded for you by Adobe or WinSoft?\r\n\r\n2. Adobe, to my knowledge,
    only signs a master license to Winsoft, not to individual resellers. You are claiming
    Adobe made an exception to you. This is unlikely.\r\n\r\n3. Winsoft respects territorial
    rights, like most manufacturers, and prohibits a reseller from one country to
    sell outside his or her territory. You are claiming Adobe made an exception to
    you. By doing so, you are given an unfair advantage over  every reseller except
    of course WinSoft's online store.\r\n\r\nIf you may sell worldwide over the Internet,
    why can't other resellers, as your plug-ins are a separate low-cost item? Couldn't
    you sell the plug-ins worldwide, but adhere to WinSoft's standard arrangements?\r\n\r\nIf
    this is in deed true, why is a special consideration given to you? Why does WinSoft
    or printisrael.com post a notice refering to this special status?\r\n\r\nSo, for
    these reasons, I don't believe (with all due respect to your Torah knowledge)
    you are correct, until I see written proof otherwise.\r\n\r\nYour web site is
    in deed attractive, with the exception of a blurry Adobe logo. I'm sure Adobe
    would provide you with a higher resolution logo, if you in deed have a direct
    business relationship with them.\r\n\r\nI really hope that you prove me wrong,
    because otherwise this act is totally unjustified and can have very harmful results."

    coming from Radak, according to William Chomsky, the idea of long and short vowels

    is that IIRC Noam Chomsky, son of William, started his linguistic studies with
    Hebrew grammar, and that was one influence that eventually led him to develop
    his famous theory of \"transformational generative grammar\" that he claims underlays

  body: "I spoke to a great Hebrew grammar expert, Rabbi Shmuel Rabin, of Toronto,
    Canada, author of a remarkable treatise on chanting aloud the Scroll of Esther.
    He inserted in all the correct places, the shva-na, according to the system of
    Rav Zalman Henna.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady, the
    first Lubavitcher Rebbe, prefered Rav Henna's system over the others popularized
    by Rabbi Yaakov Emben, Minchat Shai, based upon the writing of the Radak, Rabbi
    David Kimchi.\r\n\r\nRsbbi Rabin clarified that the popular Lubavitcher prayerbook,
    <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite>, first introduced to the Lubavitcher community the
    appearance of the shva-na. Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own rendition of the prayerbook
    did not mark them.\r\n\r\nRabin explained that the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe greatly
    expanded the <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite> prayerbook by inserting copies of pages
    from the <cite>Seder Avodah</cite> prayerbook, which marked the shva-na according
    to the system of Rav Henna. The editor of the <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite>, the
    seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, was accustomed not to change things for no special
    reason.\r\n\r\nAs proof of this, Kehot of Israel retypeset their prayerbook like
    the view of the Minchat Shai and others, while Kehot of the US follows the old
    Kehot prayerbook exactly, i.e. Rav Henna's system of defining the shva-na.\r\n\r\nRabin
    said that Henna's system was more complicated, and like Minchat Shai, originated
    with the Radak (Kimchi). \r\n\r\nHe also believes it is possible to determine
    shva-na, if rules can be made first for a kamatz katan which precedes a shva,
    recognition or placement of the meteg (used differently if there's taamim or not),
    but it will require much time and effort to sort out. So, both experts in Hebrew
    grammar, Prof. Dotan and Rabbi Rabin, agree that it is possible. Rabin warns that
    this is very difficult accord to Rav Henna's system.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rabin is
    a Hebrew grammar expert, he explained that the view of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement
    is to degrade the emphasis on Hebrew grammar. He quote the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe,
    Rabbi Sholem Dovber, in the latter's book, <cite>Torat Shalom</cite>, regarding
    the importance of correct pronunciation, based upon the rules of Hebrew grammar,
    in prayer. \r\n\r\nRabbi Sholem Dovber said it's far more important to pronounce
    the words correctly in general, to understand the meaning of the words, and to
    pray with a sincere and broken heart. For this reason, the seventh Lubavitcher
    Rebbe was heard when he payed out loud as the <cite</cite>chazan</cite>, the \u05E9\u05DC\u05D9\u05D7
    \u05E6\u05D9\u05D1\u05D5\u05E8, \"lit. leader of the congregation\", to emphasize
    chanting in a sing-song manner, and heart-felt feelings, and to ignore issues
    of Hebrew grammar, even though he was well versed in them from childhood.\r\n\r\nThis
    is consistant with the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the Chassidic
    movement, that G-d wants the heart, that prayer is measured more by intentions
    and feelings, and less by rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nRegarding Kimchi's rules
    of Hebrew grammar, how could two different systems come out of Kimchi's writings?

    am expanding the Unicode Hebrew standard to include all graphic symbols that are
    used in Hebrew, and those that do not earn a Unicode to include them in my fonts,
    such as a folded lamed or ayin, a truncated final nuhn or final chof (do you know
    what that is?),a set of shva-na symbols, or the hataf kamatz katan (soon to be
    widely used - he, he).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do, which Prof. Dotan and Rabbi Rabin,
    think can be done, is to create a kind contextual analysis to insert a kamatz
    katan, maybe meteg, and shva-na like John Hudson's (fairly easy) furtive patach
    (that Jewish publishers never did before Koren).\r\n\r\nIt's not grammar. It contual
    analysis."

  body: "Yes, but that is my point. With the furtive patach, you can encode it (if
    people actually want it is another question), but I still don't see how you are
    going to even encode the kamatz katan. Even with our siddur we have made editorial
    decisions as to what is a kamatz katan or not based on various sources and changed
    our minds. How are you going to allow a person what to do?\r\n\r\nI always cite
    the easy example of the Hebrew word for afternoon which the first kamatz is katan
    according to sefardim and gadol according to ashkenazim (and that's an easy one).
    You have yet to address this problem."

    glyph they want.\r\n\r\nChocalate for chocalate lovers; vanilla for vanilla lovers;
    and even strawberry for those daring type.\r\n\r\nIf a GSUB routine can be written
    whereby ordinary kamatzes will be selectively replaced with one form of kataz
    katan, then so it shall be.\r\n\r\nI then make three nearly identical versions
    of the font, each with a different default. If you pay extra, you get chocalate.
    If you pay extra, you get vanilla.\r\n\r\nAbout kamatz katan for Ashkenazim, I
    was told by Israel-based kollel Hemdat HaAretz (the halachic decider for the OU)
    that even for them it is an issue, just not in recognizable pronunciation.\r\n\r\nI
    think they mean on how it impacts the shva-na."

    (Shlita) Talmud class at Ave I and Coney Island Avenue - by the Young Israel.\r\n\r\nI
    think some parts were recreated to reduce the page count, and makes those tightened
    sections not pleasing to the eye, as is stated in Hebrew.\r\n\r\nAfter careful
    and attentive review, I am confince that the great Mr. E. Koren's magnificent
    face is not suited for prayer.\r\n \r\nGoHebrew calls it \"Crown\", due to its
    sound and loftiness. I subjected it to US Copyright at the Library of Congress
    in Washington, DC, and to a design patent there also. After a long correspondance,
    the director of the Copyright Office conceded that it indeed was subject to copyright,
    in a landmark decision, which led to Adobe's successful yection repeatedly from
    NY.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Koren Publishing has submitted a copyright application,
    nor registered a trademark in the US. This is a gross oversight by Mr. Miller."

    better suited to study, which is much quicker and less focused on form but the
    meaning of the 'sentences'.\r\n\r\nAsk any sofer stam scribe.\r\n\r\nEliyahu Koren
    is based rather heavily upon an Ashkenazic influence ancient design, while the
    classic Romm family Vilna fat design, like Bodoni Poster, is based direcly upon
    super ancient Sephardic Bible drawings shown to Bodoni's students by Mr. Romm
    senior, as reported by Frederick Goudy (?) in his thin book. This suggest that
    this design is better suited for study as well."

    a great medieval Torah scholar. Rashi composed the great commentaries on the Bible
    and the Talmud, that have never been surpassed to this very day.\r\n\r\nTradition
    has it that his birth was miraculous, and he was sent to this world by G-d to
    compose these two tremendous commentaries.\r\n\r\nAt the time, or shortly thereafter,
    the rabbis insisted that the Bible and the core of the Talmud should be ;resented
    differently than the commentaries. The Bible and the Talmud were drawn or typeset
    in square letters like Romm Vilna square letters by the Sephardic Jews or like
    the original source of Koren square letters by the Ashkenazic Jews, and the commentaries
    round narrow like Rashi round letters by the Ashkenazic Jews or like the unnamed
    round letters by the Sephardic Jews, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls (Go Hebrew

    that I have recently begun searching for. The sample labelled "Judisch-Deutsch"
    appears to be an example of the <em>mashkit</em> or <em>vayber-taytsh</em> style
    of printing, which resembles, but is not identical to, the style called "Rabbinic"
    or "Rashi" - but while the latter is used for commentaries in texts like the Talmud,
    usually for Aramaic text, the former was used - up to the eighteenth century,
    but not much beyond that - for texts in Yiddish.
