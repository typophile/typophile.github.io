<div class=commentbody>Strokes look almost like Hebrew script.

<div class=commentbody>This is great stuff. And why wouldn't it work for text? You might not set a book in it, but if people use HELVETICA for text why would they balk at <i>this</i>? The half-serifs are great, and very nicely counter-balanced so it doesn't look like it's leaning backwards. And I actually like the flat stem bottoms - it gives a nice contrast and makes the design more "progressive". <br> <br>Your x-height is modest (which means large point size usage), but your color is darkish and your spacing a bit loose (both better for smaller sizes). It's hard to say which direction would be better. We don't have enough evocative fonts suitable for small sizes (here I mean about 9 point), so if you pull the extenders [back] in it might make this a more valuable contribution to type, I think. <br> <br>Whatever direction you go though, plesae take this all the way. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Cool. <br>I think this is getting pretty interesting - you've put a lot of "expression" which is great for small sizes, but you have some stylistic mixing too, so it's not boring. That acute accent is killer! <br> <br>Some suggestions: <br>- A slightly wider "a". <br>- Bigger eye in the "e". <br>- The "f" might be slightly too expressive. <br>- What do the "f"-"i" and "f"-el (non-ligated) sequences look like? <br>- I'd give the lower arm of the "k" a non-flat terminal. <br>- Maybe a stronger bar on the "t" (and maybe the "f" as well). <br>- The question mark could be more in character. <br>- I like smallish capitals, but for small point sizes I think it will backfire, especially in your classically-narrow letters like "E". What you can do is make them all wider. <br>- The numerals you have look nice, but too small. Try hybrid numerals. <br>- Judging form the last line (the rest are justified so I can't tell), I think your blank space needs to be a hair wider. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I made the capitals slightly bigger and increased the extenders a very little. The 'f' is a difficult story: on the pdf it is non-ligated. It has so much overlap that it swallows the dot on the 'i' and merges with the extender of the 'l'. I intended that in the beginning, but I'm not sure if I want that effect to happen all the time. for example 'f' 'i-accute' is where this goes wrong. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34912.jpg alt> <br> <br>Adapted the 'a' , 'e', '?' , 'space' and made the bar on the 't' wider. <br> <br>The hybrid numeralrs are bulls eye! A realy great concept. <br> <br>I know that it's far from perfect at the moment. Most weights and curves and forms have yet to be corrected, but after this weekends work this is status quo. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/fontin3c-34913.pdf target=_blank><b>fontin3c.pdf</b></a> (26.2 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>> I tried it with a lighter version <br> <br>Did you try it on a laser printer? Their lower resolution reduces differences (compared to imagesetter output). But if the font is meant for lasers, then that's the best test, yes. <br> <br>Interpolation: are you using FontLab? It's in the manual. But Fontographer can do it too. The main trick is to make sure the structure of the curves (number/type of points, curve direction) is identical between the two extremes. <br> <br>Your "e"s: there seems to be a difference in behavior on the inside of the lower stroke. Also, I'd make the horizontal bar flare more, not less, the greater the weight. <br> <br>Lastly: darker forms have to be taller to appear the same height. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This is looking really sharp! <br> <br>Some observations: <br>- I think the "g" needs a stronger ear - something that rises and thickens. <br>- I'd give the tail of the "q" a curl. <br>- I like the funky "s", but it's leaning left. <br>- The tail of the "y" is too flat inside. <br> <br>The new Bold: I think you need a <i>little</i> bit more weight. :-/ <br>BTW, I'd give the Bold's "g" a larger opening in the tail's gap (so maybe make the head smaller). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> The new Bold: I think you need a little bit more weight. :-/ <br>LOL, I'm going to print the darn thing tomorrow and look very, very critical(y) at it. The difference between my earlier bold and this one is globaly about (in FontLab horizontaly) 5 em units. <br> <br>Think you're right about all the observations...Don't know about the tail of the q. Help me out; where is that thing residing. My terminology sometimes isn't that good. <br> <br> I myself am not sure if I should lower the thin stem hitting the stem on the m, n etc. (my terminology doesn't follow me </div>

<div class=commentbody>ROMAN: <br>lc: All good, except the "o" and "s" are too narrow. <br>UC: I like the classical widths. You might make the "L" slightly wider. My only "global" complaint is that the waist (like in "A" and "H") is a bit too high. <br>Numerals: those mild hybrids are super. <br>Accents: Nice nice! I'd give the ring stroke contrast though. <br>Other: The percent/mille is too "geo". The "@" sign is really nice. The BP is too big, no? The bar thickness in the "AE" has to be resolved. I'd close up the double-quotes. <br> <br>The Italic looks charming, although the "k" (especially) and "f" seem distracting. <br> <br>The Bold's spacing is too tight (still assuming your color and proportions imply smaller sizes). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Thanks (especially hrant) for all the comments. It helped me me very much to realize my final version of the 'Fontin'.
I've desided to make it free. A download link can be requested at my website:

<div class=commentbody>Hi. Sorry if this is rude. I wanted to tell Jos how much I enjoyed working with Fontin in a recent web project:
[[http://depts.washington.edu/apac/]]
Congratulations on creating such a beautiful typeface. And thanks for letting me use it!
Best wishes,
Jennifer</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hej Joe, just thought I'd give you a compliment as well. :)
I really like the early version, extra friendly-looking font as well. I think a super-cool future project would be "Fontin Friendly", the extra kind version! :D
Is the font Open Source btw? If it is, then I think it would make for an outstanding addition to the League of Movable Type website.
It's just so darn fitting for that project. </div>
