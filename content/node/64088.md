  body: Ah, but there had to be a catch - it's a TrueType font. A little risky I think
    for a print piece...

  body: "I wonder if anyone cares about this, but Kirby's Hand is a ripoff from a
    ClickArt Handwritten Fonts CD. The actual name of this font is \"Page\", and these
    fonts were copied and renamed and then widely sold by WSi Systems (even through
    secondary vendors), until they were told to cease and desist. Broderbund still
    packages the ClickArts fonts with some of their font collections.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    Yanega: I vaguely remembered something like that. My bad in not following thorough.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    here's the link to the \"ClickArt\xAE Fonts Version 4\", certainly a bargain at

    there's no apparent way to know if Page is included among the \r\n    * 3,500
    decorative true type fonts\r\n    * 120 scrapbook fonts\r\n    * 330 handwriting

  body: "@ vivicity\r\n\r\nI ran a prepress department at a commercial printer for
    years and I can tell you first hand that TrueType fonts haven't really been an
    issue for printers who have upgraded their RIPs (Raster Image Processors) within
    the last 10 years or so. If the printer isn't providing a proof (highly unlikely)
    and you are concerned about the output just convert all of your type to outline
    prior to sending files to the printer."

    goes to PDF (as we usually do).\r\nIt doesn't work if you try to open the PDF
    in Illustrator, so outlining may be an issue as well...\r\n\r\n@Mike Yanega\r\nThanks
    for the additional info. Of course the client's agency worked with Kirby - the
    free derivative version of the font. Go figure.\r\n\r\n"
