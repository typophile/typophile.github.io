  body: There might be some rule of thumb out there, but this really isn't all that
    hard to figure out. You just need to make it clear where lines end and where they
    start. Apart from that, it's really a question of style.

  body: I think the sample you've shown is good. So if you've followed your rule for
    that then I say go with it.
