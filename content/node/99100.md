    additional information about your project. Is Bickham for chapter titles in your
    book and you're looking for a text font? Is it a wedding invitation? Christmas
    card? Are you looking for a serif or san serif font? More info is needed.\r\n\r\nCourtesy

    body: "Thank you so much for your comment J. Tillman, it is actually for a logo
      design. I am using the uppercase A and wanted to find a typeface to compliment
      it for the company name. The company is language based and the stationery will
      be letter pressed, they also have a strong presence online so although the company
      will have a traditional feel it needs to have a contemporary execution too.
      \r\nAs for serif or sans serif I didn't want to be too closed to suggestions
      and I've tried both but as of yet I'm not completely happy with the results
      so any suggestions would be most welcome.\r\nThank you for any assistance you
      maybe able to supply."

  body: "I feel like your struggle is not to find the right font, but to find a design
    concept. What do you want the logo to say? The more specific you can get, the
    more you\u2019ll have to work with as a designer.\r\n\r\nFor example, \u201Clanguage
    based\u201D is a bit general\u2014dig deeper: what services/products do they offer,
    translation, writing, research, layout, audio?\r\n\r\nAre they archaeologists
    hunting down the Word that will reveal history\u2019s secrets?\r\nAre they communication
    specialists who can hone your business\u2019s PR strategy into a sharp, deadly
    edge?\r\nAre they interpreters who can order you supper in any country in the
    world?\r\n\r\nThe font you pick has very little to do with projecting any of these
    messages (as long as it\u2019s well-made)."
