body: I need to self-print two emergency envelopes for invitations that should have
  gone out last week (all the others did already). My invitation typeface is Trajan
  Regular. Is there a typeface that is sufficiently similar but available in either
  MS Word for Mac or in Apple iWork?  I'm really in a jam and I can't afford the turn-around
  time involved in getting my envelope person to address them and return them to me.  Thanks!

    a true type, so it should work across platforms just fine."

  body: This font is indeed right on, but, unfortunately, nearly all letters have
    artwork -- they're not just the plain letters, but they add "bricks" of one sort
    or another, as shown in the sample palettes.  They do work beautifully in Word,
    as you suggested, but they can't be used for the envelopes.  Still searching ...
    Thanks.
