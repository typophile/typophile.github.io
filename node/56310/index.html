Maybe we should look east for some innovation? Maybe it's time for the <A HREF="http://typophile.com/node/56329">Europeans</A> to step up here, rather than let American companies own the market.

Most of the computers you buy (including Apple) are just rebranded Taiwanese systems packed into a case designed by an American or European. And non-US nations were leading the design of wireless phone tech of all kinds right up to the release of the iPhone. because our government still fund IT more than anybody else. On a large-scale level, it’s because things like high-end semiconductor and networking hardware design are a hard place to play catch-up, and our companies probably end up hiring anyone smart enough to do anything but play catch-up.</div>

Some are, but not Apple. Apple products are very much engineered by Apple, rather than existing systems in new boxes. Yes, it's all made overseas, of course.

And lets not forget Japan, either.</div>

Well that's all we know at the moment, and it's Apple's official position on the matter. I'm unsure as to whether that individual so eager to apply for the position is aware of that. If he is, it seems he thinks it's inaccurate or untrue.

he might be years behind the leading edge
-- latest example, the delay on itablets --
but he's years ahead of any other company,
so i guess he deserves his reputation as a
"visionary", even if i personally cannot see it.

in the land of the blind, a one-eyed man is king.

if it weren't for the iphone, the "smart" phones
would be just as dumb right now as they were
5 years ago, and facing no forward progress...

kinda scary to realize how much rides on this
one single solitary man, and how retarded things
would be if he weren't out there leading the way...

so when i read this, a while back, it was very sad:
>   http://www.cringely.com/2009/02/wheres-steve/

anyway, best of luck getting well, steve.  we need you.

It's no more a PR quote than an announcement of an upcoming font. I was stating a fact. It's actually common knowledge for those who follow Apple's activities. There is no evidence to suggest whatsoever that Apple is looking for a new CEO at this time, much less someone from outside the company.</div>
