  and I've collected some images in the attached. \r\nA lot of these are probably
  handpainted, but I'm looking for the right feel as well as any bang on matches.
  \r\nOne particular piece I'd like to identify is the white THINK on green. \r\n\r\nI've
  found that Jeff Levine has quite a few good possibilities http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Jeff_Levine/\r\n\r\nDo
  you have any recommendations? Thanks so much for your brainpower. \r\n\r\nhttp://i1096.photobucket.com/albums/g323/Breakhousedesign/oldsafetysigns.png\r\n\r\nCameron"

    from Letterhead Fonts is almost exactly the same as THINK, you''d just need to
    slant it.'
