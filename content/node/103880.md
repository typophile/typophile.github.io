  attention span. Often I have to write elevator-pitch summaries for which Narrow
  / Condensed fonts work much better than Regular version of fonts. Also, earlier
  I had been using Garamond or Cambria for printed-out presentations, but after reading
  articles about Baskerville font, I tried out Baskerville Old Face. While the switched
  to Baskerville Old Face hasn't noticeably improved any success rates, I have received
  more positive comments about the presentations. \r\n\r\nAre there any font recommendations
  that are simultaneously BOTH\r\n(a) Narrow / Condensed\r\n(b) based on Baskerville
  (Old Face)\r\n\r\nFreely available font recommendations will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPrad"

    its horizontal generosity. The good news is that I wouldn't call Baskerville an
    \"Old Face\", and hopefully you actually mean the latter and not the former.  :-)\r\n\r\nWhat
    about Kepler, or Octavian?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kepler/scn/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/octavian/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    do you refer to ?\r\n\r\nAlso, would you know if there any websites where I can
    filter fonts by multiple characteristics like Narrow / Condensed in addition to
    Serif and your \"horizon generosity\" measure?\r\n\r\n"

    is slightly condensed, and has an x-height much larger than the historical transitionals.
    As the name implies it is best used for headlines and titles."
