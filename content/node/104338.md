  two typefaces on this book cover? (Jan Huizinga, In the Shadow of Tomorrow, 1936)?\r\n\r\nI
  realize it's hand-lettered, but anything close as a starting place would be a big
  help - with some attention to the detail/peculiarities, if possible.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Huizinga_6479.jpg]"

  body: kinda weird and not really a script, but [[http://www.fonts.com/font/ascender/crestwood/regular|Crestwood]]
    has a similar feel and if you invert the S and f they are even more alike to your
    sample. odd.

  body: The letterforms of the script show some similarities with Trafton Script,
    which was designed in 1933. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/pacific-script/|Pacific
    Script]] is a revival of it.
