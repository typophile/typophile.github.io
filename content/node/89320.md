  then they still existed. \r\n\r\nI am not sure what they used for the full \"Hapag-Lloyd
  Express\" titles. I guess it's an altered kind of Arial but I am not sure, maybe
  more condensed letters. \r\n\r\nI have attached an example.\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help.\r\n\r\nChristian"

  body: "\"EXPRESS\" looks like <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/trade-gothic/|Trade
    Gothic LT Condensed No 18]]</strong>\r\n\r\n\"HAPAG LLOYD\" could be also <strong>Trade
    Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20</strong>\r\nbut that /G must be customized\r\n\r\nI
    found them using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"

    'G' but they really seem to have altered it...no problem :-).
