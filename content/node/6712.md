  body: Incidently Ole, these are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/medium/testdrive.html?s=downtown&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank"> Bank Gothic</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/compacta/bold/testdrive.html?s=DOG%20Lounge&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Compacta</a>. I&#39;ll  <BR>be moving your request to its dedicated
    thread soon. You  <BR>should know better than to hijack someone else&#39;s thread  <BR>for
    your ID request... <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
