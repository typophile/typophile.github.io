  how flexible its actually going to be."

    original type system as far as they could and wanted a new direction.

    I had to hear it from an article on the internet.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The original Walker font is used mainly as a logo these days, which as I've
    noted before, is too bad because the font is great - even just as a straight ahead
    sans without the add-ons.\r\n\r\n> wasn\u2019t actually used much to its intended
    extent\r\nThis is pretty fair. During the mid to late 90s the font got a major
    workout and was often used in very elaborate ways - sometimes all serif styles
    used at once etc. Tastes change though. Eventually the font was used mostly as
    a stripped down sans for internal museum publications and the monthly calendar.
    Since the designers work with individual curators or directors of programs, the
    idea of a one size fits all font grew a little thin. Modern dance events soon
    looked just like film events and on down. So the font was only shortly used for
    everything and maybe never completely. It's hard to say, the output from the studio
    is pretty amazing so tracking it is next to impossible.\r\n\r\nAll that said,
    the Walker font is still around, just not as loudly. As for the new one, I just
    engineered it. The design is not mine."
