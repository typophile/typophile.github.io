    from those rounds, and definitely leave in the slight differences between the
    'a's.\r\n\r\nI also don't think that the yellow paint strokes work.\r\n\r\n -

  body: "The use of the bird is excellent. I really enjoy the one you have with the
    bird coming out of the 'Y', but I have to agree with Riccard0 and that you are
    losing the Hair/Beauty concept.\r\n\r\nIf you feel it right, continue with the
    one above my post with the bird in the 'C'. I know it is a script font but perhaps
    some tweaking is in order. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think to achieve that Hair/Beauty
    concept you should track it out some. Give it a little more open and airy feeling.
    \r\n\r\nMost of all, great concepts and sketches."

  body: '#3 from the first image speaks to me the most. I would refine the canary
    silhouette though. Try making it less dense, maybe render it in some fluid brush
    strokes that match the weight of the typeface you used in that particular example.'

  body: Agree with penn.and.ink, that immediately stood out as the strongest. The
    restrained use of the silhouette really makes it work. The only thing I would
    take a look at would be how "Health & Beauty" relates to "Canary". The width is
    in that in-between, neither here nor there space, and the relation to "y" feels
    a little awkward. I think it's the good type choice though.

  body: <a href="http://www.saicosmetics.com"> Hair Transplantation </a> Is a surgical  technique
    that involves moving skin containing hair follicles from one part of the body
    (the donor site) to bald or balding parts (the recipient site). It is primarily
    used to treat male pattern baldness, whereby grafts containing hair follicles
    that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to bald scalp.
