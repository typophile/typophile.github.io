  those interested in the job (contact me at cwrichardkim@gmail.com): \r\nThe Old\r\nWe
  find that our current logo has a range of issues:\r\n1) It\u2019s too bland.  We
  strived for simple, but ended up with bland.\r\n2) Unrelatable to our primary audience
  (college students)\r\n3) We strove for: Sleek, high quality, class, professional,
  fun\r\n\r\nThe New\r\nWe\u2019re looking for a new identity for our upcoming expansion\r\n1)
  Color scheme.  Finding a color scheme that fits us is our primary mission.  The
  colors have to work across the platform\r\n2) More fun while keeping the quality.
  \ Our userbase consists primarily of college students looking for a pizza deal and
  an upcoming concert. We\u2019re looking for a way to keep the sleek and simple image
  but add a splash of personality\r\n3) Minimal changes to the current logo.  We still
  want our image to be continuous and recognizable after the change\r\n4) Adjectives:
  Sleek, simple, fun, reliable, likable, lighthearted, going out[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Desktop
