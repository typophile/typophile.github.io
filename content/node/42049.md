  Goudy by one of our customers.\r\n\r\nGoogle search led us to this site.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zymmetrical.com/Art/Fonts/Fonts-Collections/fontpackvol2.htm\r\n\r\nWe
  purchased and downloaded the \"high quality\" font set comprising of 8,000 TTF's
  for $14.95 expecting to find the QT Goudy Old fonts in there, but they weren't.\r\n\r\nI
  have emailed their sales email address, but have heard nothing back as of yet.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone heard of this font?, or dealt with these people before?\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nNeil"

    Old Style</a>. I\u2019ve never heard of \u2018QT\u2019 as a foundry/manufacturer
    code, so I assume that\u2019s some rip-off.\r\nF"

    Aszszelp raised, no I didn't expect quality, which, if you took the time to actually
    read what I wrote, I put high quality in quotes, which in my language usually
    denotes a tad of sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n\r\nNeil\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Neill,\r\n\r\nMy guess is that QT Old Goudy is Zymmetricals 'adaptation'
    or 'version' of one of Frederic Goudy\u2019s classic typefaces, for instance the
    aforementioned Goudy Old Style. But of course it could be any other of his dozens
    of typefaces.\r\nIf you could provide us with an image, we will be able to point
    you to a legal, high-quality (in the sense of well behaving on a computer and
    more similar to the original) version.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
