body: "For a branding project, I'm designing the corporate presentation template.\r\nI
  want to know which format is better for online distribution > PDF or PPT?\r\n   points
  to be considered :\r\n   1. The type rendering methods of microsoft PPT & Adobe
  PDF. I found that in PPT especially at smaller sizes the typefacec is not rendered
  correctly. ( i'm using FF DIN / sapient & Amplitude)\r\n   2. The document creator
  ( from my clients marketing dept -a non designer) has to use powerpoint to create
  the presentation & then has to convert it into PDF ( since PPT dosen't embedd fonts)\r\n\r\nPls
  help\r\n\r\nAmogh"

  body: "Consider the EULA\u2019s: \r\n\r\nAmplitude (Font Bureau)\r\nEmbedding of
    the Font Software is expressly prohibited. For the purposes of this agreement
    \"embedding\" shall be defined as the temporary duplication of the Font Software
    in formats that include, but not limited to the PDF, Flash, TrueDoc and/or other
    Web Embedding Font Technology (\"WEFT\") formats now in existence as well as any
    other format that may be created in the future.\r\n\r\nFF Din (Fontfont)\r\nYou
    may embed the Font Software in documents, applications or devices either as a
    rasterized representation of the Font Software (e. g., a GIF or JPEG) or as a
    subset of the Font Software as long as the document, application or device is
    distributed in a secure format that permits only the viewing and printing but
    not the editing of the text.\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t find any typeface named Sapient,
    so I\u2019m not sure about that.\r\n\r\nEssentially, FF Din allows embedding in
    a PDF document if it\u2019s secured and Amplitude doesn\u2019t. Power Point (in
    Windows) does not render your fonts incorrectly per se, just differently. If the
    fonts were hinted for screen, they wouldn\u2019t look \u201Cwrong\u201D. \r\n\r\nI
    think your best option is to stick with FF Din and export the presentation as
    a PDF, since embedding the fonts in a PPT would be a EULA violation (because you
    can edit the text). Viewing the presentation as a PDF would also rid you of the
    rendering problem."

    again!\r\n\r\ni've another question now, \r\nI've seen Amplitude used in some
    PDFs for some corporates. Can we buy Amplitude for this purpose as well?\r\n\r\nbtw,
    sapient is FFDin released for Sapient corp. ( as far as i could gather)\r\n"

    way Microsoft PPT & Adobe PDF renders the fonts on screen. I've known the idea
    of Hinted fonts. but then anything specific to Powerpoint?"

  body: If your goal to simply show & explain the template, a PDF is probably the
    best solution. But an actual PowerPoint file template would certainly be a timesaver
    for the end users and would help compliance in that you could set it up with the
    logo (and any other mandatory elements) already sized and correctly placed, corporate
    colors, etc. Just don't embed the fonts unless the license agreement permits it
    (and you can't embed fonts in the Mac version of PowerPoint anyway).

  body: 'one tip I learned from my old boss if you are showing to a live group: he
    saved the PDF as a giant one-page jpg, and then opened it in Photoshop, which
    has smooth scrolling and zoom with the navigator tool. It worked well for the
    project we were doing, and the stage we were at (first pitch) because we were
    showing a large scale look and feel as well as the smaller graphic components.'
