  I'm creating a marketing campaign for a art exhibition in which I've used Futura
  BT extra black condensed for the main title and I need a body text font to compliment
  it in the brochure and leaflets.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a highly leigable serif
  font any suggestions? I've dabbled with Scala but I'm not sure if the balance is
  right.\r\n\r\nThanks guys"

  body: "palatino looks good and clean with futura. i've been using that pair for
    years and the readers of the magazine have to digest large amounts of technical
    and somewhat dry info, but it provides good page contrast without being too exotic.\r\n\r\ni
    also partner it with rockwell for infographics. still readable but the styles
    are limited, you may have to force the bold (.25 to .5 stroke of same color) and
    italic (10% slant) as a menu style in indesign.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled
