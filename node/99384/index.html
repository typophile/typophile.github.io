  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi- 

I am updating my company's logo which was made from a script font straight out of the box.  I would like someone to change approximately 4 letters using computer manipulation to make it look more like a designed logo. I *do not* want this done "by hand"/pen and ink, etc.

This is a logo (of letters only) used on the internet or very small on business cards, etc, so it doesn't need to be done at extremely high resolution.

My company is small. I am committed to being fair but I don't have a big budget.

I'd like to see samples of work you have done using font manipulation or lettering design and an idea of what you charged  on example projects so I can get an a idea of your pricing before answering the question, "What's your budget?" because 1) I don't know yet and 2) it will depend on the person I end up working with. 

I'm serious and not looking to waste anybody's time. If you are young, talented and working freelance, you're probably the sort of person who'd be compatible with this project.

Please contact me at wt.billing@gmail.com to discuss further.

Thank you!

		<div class="commentbody">WT: What usually gets lost in these discussions is this: Type is no longer a physical object -- you no longer buy type. What you've bought is a license to use some software. That license has restrictions about how you use the software.

There are ways to modify the characters generated by font software without modifying that software. That's legal, at least, in the U.S.

If someone can do the needed work in a layout program (e.g., InDesign), it is also relatively inexpensive. If not, then it is going to get costly, probably more than if the work was done in a font editing program.

As people have said, check the EULA (font license) for the font. Or, if it is an Adobe Original, we can assure you it is permitted to modify the software (do the work with a font editor).

Your best way out, if the font is from one of the smaller publishers, might be to have the font designer do the work. Some would, some wouldn't. Doesn't hurt to ask.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah but don't type designers just get around all that EULA stuff by simply doing a revival? That's what you guys call it right ...a revival? You know, tweak a letter shape here and there and call it your own ;) And besides, a creative interpretation of an original copyright ain't illegal. Otherwise art students would getting kicked out of every gallery in world ;)

Over the xmas break I saw my one of graphics (poster I did for the U.N.) show on the back of some playing cards! 

Katherine, I love your 'come on in' video. And just on a side matter, have you considered using tattoo models with your pin-up pieces?

Even if you don't anticipate needing it in a large size, a professional would almost certainly prepare the logo as vector art, which means it doesn't have a resolution like a photo, it's art that can be enlarged to any size without loss of quality. (Google "vector graphics" if you want details.) 

They will probably give you copies in several formats, but at least one of them should be a vector format.</div>
