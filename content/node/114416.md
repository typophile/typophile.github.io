  was on the box for a telescope I purchased  about 5 or 10 years ago. Some sort of
  techno font. I scanned Myfonts for tags techno, futuristc, computer and a few others
  and found quite a few similars but no match. Same for the dafont techno themes.
  Any ideas? Thanks.\r\nDon"

    was surprised to learn that the font has existed since the 1990s.\r\nDon"
