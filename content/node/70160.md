  about the font and where to get it. He did even contact the designer, and was told
  that it's name is Politie and supposedly designed by The Foundry. But it's no where
  to be found. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone now this font? The name and or where to get it?\r\n\r\n"

    it\u2019s customized."

  body: "That font looks very much like Sulki & Min <a href=\"http://www.sulki-min.com/wp/?p=571\"><strong>Politie</strong></a>
    about which they say:\r\n\r\nTypeface, self-published, 2002. Politie is a monospace
    adaptation of the typeface Wim Crouwel designed in the 1960s for the typewriter
    manufacturer Olivetti, which was released after decades as digital fonts by the
    Foundry in London (Foundry Gridnik). Although neither the original nor the Foundry\u2019s
    interpretation was designed as a fixed-width typeface, its rigid, modular letterform
    seemed apt for a monospace adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe font <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html\"><strong>Foundry
    Gridnik</strong></a> looks different though (and Sulki & Min write that Politie
    was never released commercially)\r\n\r\n"
