  had a Smith Corona at the time and I always thought hers was so cool, so moderne.
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThis is a related question. I recently saw an Olivetti Lettera
    35 manual typewriter up for auction on e-bay. The seller included a photo of something
    typed on the machine. The lettering was something I've never seen before. It looked
    very \"mod\" and somewhat thick. I've been looking and looking but can't seem
    to find the font. Does anyone know what typeface this is?"

    a typeface that comes from Olivetti sources to which I contributed, but it got

  body: "Michael: yes, instead of just having slots of the same widths, you settle
    on two (bispaced), three (trispaced), four\u2013 and so on. In a bi-spaced system
    for example you could imagine most letters having the same widths and then have
    a half-width for letters like i, l, etc. It seems to me like it has a lot of educational
    value for newcomers to type design: they could start out with a monospaced font
    which is easier to draw because you don\u2019t have to think about spacing much,
    and then they could move on bi-spacing it, trispacing it, etc. until they have
    something that actually works."

  body: "A decent mono/bi/tri-space font requires a lot of optical work to get the
    spacing right. I\u2019m thinking perhaps it\u2019s better to go for the proportional
    ones at once."

  body: Having made a mono, I have to agree with Frode. You are better off making
    a proportional width first. Monos look easy and are actually quite hard.
