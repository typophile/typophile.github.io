    sizes, e.g. 13px. Great job, James.

    like when it tries to render the Postscript font in B&W, which is very different.

    the same reason I license heavy fonts that can\u2019t hold up at small sizes in
    print: most people won\u2019t use those fonts at such small sizes. Further, I
    don\u2019t have  much sympathy for people who still run Windows XP with anti-aliasing
    disabled. I\u2019m not going to be held back by people who insist that their desktop
    experience should not move beyond the 1990s. I stopped using X Windows on Solaris
    in 2005; they can stop running Windows XP without Cleartype."

  body: "I agree, Nick. To date, I've been using Arial Bold with my raster Akzidenz
    Medium heads. I was hoping to replace all type images with a web font, but Akzidenz
    is unavailable. I also want to use sizes in the 14-24px range, and the bigger
    Arial starts to looks too different.\r\n\r\nDoes 'hinting' have to do with letterspacing,
    or does it affect how type renders? If the Armitage font isn't hinted for TrueType,
    what's the potential damage? Will a segment of my audience see type that isn't
    anti-aliased, or will the spacing be weird, or something else? "

    grid, including spacing.\r\n\r\n<cite>If the Armitage font isn't hinted for TrueType\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    technically it is hinted for TrueType. But the hinting is Fontspring\u2019s particular
    application of automated hinting. It\u2019s not the size-specific manual hinting
    found in fonts like the Microsoft core web fonts or Font Bureau\u2019s Reading
    Edge fonts. \r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026what's the potential damage?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    potential damage is that Windows XP users can disable anti-aliasing entirely and
    just see black-and-white text. Without manual TrueType hinting the black-and-white
    rendering is just gross. The number of users in this situation seems to be relatively
    small but they\u2019re often office workers whose computer settings are completely
    out of their control.\r\n\r\nI see this situation as being similar to the implementation
    of USB. Around 1999 Apple decided to drop parallel, serial, SCSI and its proprietary
    hardware interfaces in favor of USB and Firewire. People claimed it was a disastrous
    move that would be one more nails in Apple\u2019s coffin. Meanwhile PC makers
    kept using parallel, serial, SCSI, and PS/2 ports on everything just to satisfy
    the occasional user who refused to get a new scanner/printer/etc. Apple told people
    to suck it up and get new hardware. Guess which computer maker has the higher
    market capitalization today?"

    computers on the web see Windows standard greyscale rendering, which - unless
    blurring at small sizes is specified in the font - is just b&w pixels.

    href=\"http://blog.fontslive.com/2010/11/web-fonts-quality.html\">Windows greyscale
    rendering is not just black and white; it\u2019s got shades of gray to provide
    some antialiasing.</a> To be just black and white a user has to disable all font
    smoothing, not many users actually do that. The Fontspring autohinting works well
    for Windows grayscale until you get below 12 pixels which is too small for many
    fonts to render well anyway. "
