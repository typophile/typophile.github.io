body: Any real collectible value in decent shape older copies of U&lc, from the late
  1970's and early 1980's? Ebay turned up almost nothing. Thanks! Sorry if this has
  been asked before, this site's quirky search field restrictions wouldn't yield any
  results for me.

    about kind of item on ebay. Plus they don't sell for much so sellers are probably
    holding back because of the current economy. At any rate, I sold off my entire
    collection, one at a time, on eBay. What are they worth? whatever anyone is willing
    to pay.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    $10-50 this past month on eBay. There are a couple of copies out there: http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/starta\r\n\r\nIlya"

  body: "The print run for U&lc, especially in its middle years, was quite large,
    so copies got around quite a bit. And it's surprising how many readers kept their
    copies; the number of collections of crumbling newsprint in designers' attics
    and basements is much greater than you might expect. So for the most part they're
    not rare. Interesting and worthwhile, yes; scarce and therefore commanding high
    prices, probably not, except perhaps for particular issues. If you have copies
    from the first several years, when Herb Lubalin was art director, those might
    be the rarest.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I figure that's a good thing. While it may mean that our carefully hoarded
    collections aren't worth big bucks, it also means that old issues of U&lc are
    easily accessible to younger designers and typographers who weren't getting it
    when it came out. It's still a mine of inspiration, and occasionally information.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"

    to the TDC Library. I haven't looked at them in years.

  body: "I remember at an ATypI fundraiser auction in Boston in 1999, Dave Farey,
    the auctioneer, withdrew an almost complete set of U&LC from bidding because the
    price was dropping below what he considered it to be worth. This pretty well sums
    up U&LC, I believe: people who value it already own it, and you can't give it
    away to people to who <em>don't</em> value it.\r\n\r\n[Edited for correction.]"

    are edited. Surely it is possible to retain the original time stamp?
