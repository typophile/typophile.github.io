  body: "Everybody else was either talking about how Helvetica is a godsend or how
    it's \"corporate evil\". Spiekermann was the only one explaining -not without
    passion- how it is simply poor craft (in addition to its other failings). He made
    the movie balanced - he made it a documentary instead of some warped \"reality
    show\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
