body: "I need a bit of help selecting a text face for a publication I'm redesigning.
  We have no budget for purchasing new faces, but have several from the Adobe suite.
  I put a star next to the faces to which i'm leaning toward:\r\n\r\nMinion + \r\nWarnock
  \r\nGiovanni\r\nBerling +\r\nGaramond\r\nUtopia\r\nRotation\r\nITC Stone Serif +\r\nCaslon
  +\r\n\r\nThe publication will be printed on a higher-quality newsprint. Not bright
  white, but not the cheap junk you see everyday. The publication is an annual city
  guidebook. It will have several feature stories and have an overall warm and inviting
  feel. \r\n\r\nI like Caslon for its readability, but i feel like it less suitable
  for a magazine-style publication. I love Minion, but one of our other publications
  uses it as a text face. Berling is nice, but i wonder if it would hold up on the
  newsprint. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Roy\r\n"

    15% brighter than your everyday newspaper newsprint. We're currently using Minion
    in another product and it works well on the same paper."

  body: Also, can you explain your thoughts about Stone and Giovanni? I tend to think
    Giovanni is a bit too round and friendly for what i'm looking for. I'm not sure
    how i feel about Stone, but i'm inclined to say that it falls into the category
    of over-used fad faces. It wears the mark of an 80's text face, no?

    know it's a pretty boring forum topic to post on since i'm not looking to purchase
    any new types, but these discusions are helpful nonetheless. \r\n\r\nBeing confined
    to the Adobe Suite can be tough. It really makes me crave something fresh. \r\n\r\nWhich
    Adobe text faces have worked well for others?"

    absolutely right. The challenge is that I'm working at a <strong>very</strong>
    budget-conscious newspaper. The publication is about 160 pages with a cheap glossy
    cover stock, upgraded newsprint text pages and it's saddle-stitched. horrible.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've considered trying to get them to allow me to purchase a text
    face, but I'd really have to be able to sell them on it. I'd have to explain why
    the typefaces they've already spent a ton of money on aren't cutting it. It's
    been explained to me that we'd have to pay for 5-6 liscenses--1 for my CPU, 2-3
    for our paginators and 2 for our RIPs. \r\n"
