body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font with 3 variations of itself: sans, serif,
  slab-serif. Usually I can only find one with sans+serif, but could hardly find any
  with slab. I know only one font like this, FF Zine. But would like to know if there
  are others. Would be great if it can be used as both headline and body text."
