  some reason I've been struggling with how short the term \"WE\" is.\r\n\r\n[[http://imgur.com/oP23REa|The
  first logo]] is based on an isometric grid. I don't know how legible it may be.\r\n[[http://imgur.com/rTZdvzQ|The
  second one]] is much simpler.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Which one should I go with?
  What should I change?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    thing giving me pause is the double, overlapping Vs that make up the W in the
    second version--I find that overlap distracting, Also, the W doesn't intersect
    with/get cut off by the bounding circle as much as the e, which also throws things
    out of balance a bit. \r\n\r\nRefine the second version, and you've got two solid
    choices.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like them both. The first one (even in black-and-white) won't reproduce
    well in photocopies, if that's a factor.

  body: "The \"W\" as crossing \"V\"s is very smart! But it's making the \"e\" seem
    like a third wheel; try to incorporate it inside the \"W\" somehow - maybe as
    a capital letter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "WE prefer the first one it gives a 'high-tech' impression if that is what
    you want.  I like it because at one time I used  letters-in-a-cube for my own
    logo (now disused) - even made a wood sculpture of a 3-letter-cube once.  A selling
    point is that the company can make small cubes for key-chains etc. as giveaways!\r\n\r\nThe
    first one's colors are beautiful but too subtle and as mentioned above will not
    appear properly in a photocopy.  Experiment with black and white or grayscale
    versions and see how it appears at different magnifications and settings.\r\nThe
    second is nice but reminds too of the Volks-Wagen logo.  Good luck deciding."
