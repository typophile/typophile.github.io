  body: "\r\nThank you for your response riccard0 .\r\n\r\n\r\nMy feeling is, it is
    a font because the letters are too consistent and unfluctuating to be hand drawn.\r\n\r\nThe
    'u's in 'Furniture', appear to be identical, as are the 'e's in Baker and Furniture."

    like this would normally be drawn at a much larger size, so accurate measuring
    is easier, and slight irregularities would be lost in the reduction to print size.
    Use of photostats, tracing and skill at drawing could all contribute to the type-like
    precision.\r\n\r\nDo you have a larger version of the old advertisement? Given
    the age of it, that swashy script would be quite difficult to set with type."

    as being from 1972, though the logotype was probably created earlier in the 1960's.\r\nThis

  body: The text font in that ad appears to be Typo Script. I did a <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/ofl.html">partial
    digitization</a> a few years back. If I had to guess, I'd say that the logo itself
    probably is hand-drawn. Note, in particular, how the join from the "r" to the
    next letter is different in "rn" and "re". Either they had OpenType back then,
    or it's hand-drawn :)

    to Typo Script!"
