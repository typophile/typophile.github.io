  \r\nI enjoy the course, however a fundamental understanding on how fonts/types are
  created is not covered in the degree program. \r\n\r\nCould someone please direct
  me to a book that is thorough about font creation? From paper to computer.\r\n\r\nOr
  if there are short courses in between semesters would be great. I'm based in Sydney,
  Australia so it would have to be local.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any assistance."
