  advices really helpful. So I decided to sign in and ask for your help on such a
  matter:\r\n\r\nI'm working on a book that will be sent free to subscribers of a
  biz mag. Size 240x260mm  (56p8x61p5) means that no one would take the book to his/hers
  business trip and likely it would spend its time on the shelf of some young executive
  after a brief flick through.\r\n\r\nThe Book consists of several articles from the
  mag. Each article starts with a title spread with two color illustration (Black
  + Pantone). Typefaces used in the book are LeMondeJurnal for the body (set 9/12)
  and PrivaPro used for titles, subtitles, subheads, quotes, pagination and sidebar
  text.\r\n\r\nThe main reason of this post are my concerns about the ligatures at
  titles and quotes. I can't make up my mind if they harmonize with illustrations
  well or are signs of over abundance?\r\n\r\nAny opinions on that matter, or any,
  concerning typography or composition in attached pdf file would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nPS.
  Is it me or the \"w\" and \"y\" in PrivaPro are tad darker than other glyphs?\r\n\r\n"

    fuck it, they're pretty. Ligs in sans always look odd anyway. That's their charm.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that caught my eye on a quick glance was the elementalism of the ogonoek
    a -- the ligatures are so fluid that this now looks just bizarre."

    it. Does this kind of ogonek look good for a polish reader? \r\nThe ligatures
    are too much in my opinion, and even less understandable is the unconsistent use
    of them.\r\ng_i looks really strange to me, in \"strategie\" there is an \"a\"
    without tail and in \"wschodz\u0105cych\" you do not use the c_h-ligature from
    \"lokalnych\"."

    book as well, but my co-workers opinions are mixed.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention
    the book is typeset in Polish - we got plenty diacritical marks most of English
    based typographical world would call bizarre - a ogonek, e ogonek, l slashed,
    z dot and many others. They're just normal common letters for Polish readers,
    so they don't compete for attention with ligatures."

  body: "Christoph,\r\nyou touched the point that concerns me most. Inconsistency
    in using ligatures is intended. In Polish words combination of letters \"ch\"
    \"gi\" \"st\" are quite common, text set using ligatures in consistent way looks
    ridiculous. Do you think inconsistency is the enough reason not to use them at
    all? Just added a pdf version without ligatures. Would you please clarify why
    in your opinion Priva is not a good choice?\r\n\r\nThank you"

    not understand the second \"a\". \r\nAlso I like clarity and I think all this
    disturbance by\r\n- unfamiliar looking ligatures (g_i does not really fit to the
    rest for me)\r\n- inconsistency (\"a\" and ligatures) and\r\n- strange looking
    diacritics\r\ndoes not serve the reader.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nChristoph"

  body: "Christoph,\r\nI can see your point of view now, thanx for sharing it.\r\n\r\n[OT]
    a ogonek is not a ligature, it's a standalone letter, and its use belongs to gramma,
    not design i.e. as \"w\xE4ren das\" is not inconsistecy in using \"a\" in German
    I belive [end of OT]"

  body: "Antoni,\r\nof course aogonek is not an inconsistency. I meant the single
    \"a\" without tail together with all the others that have one.\r\n[compare the
    a from \"strategie\" with the one in \"dla\", and also compare the \"l\" in \"dla\"
    with the ones in \"lokalnych\". These are the inconsistencies I don't like]\r\nUsually
    the ogonek is smoothly connected with the letter, but here it is barely not touching
    it, which looks kind of strange to me. But I am not from Poland, so this is an
    issue you must know better.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nChristoph"

    the ligatures of a \"small\" letter (say, s or g) with a tall one (t or i) a bit
    odd, while i like the ch one (in the word \"lokalnych\").\r\nI agree with your
    comment on the w and the y in Priva, but only because you made me notice it!"

    like]</cite>\r\n\r\nsilly me - I misuderstood you (language issues) - I would
    call different glyphs of the letter alternates - and these I didn't intend to
    differ. I was just playing with new typeface and forgot clean it up before posting.
    I updated pdf how should I've done it before. Sorry for unnecessary confusing
    you with these - and thanx for pointing them out.\r\n\r\n<cite>Usually the ogonek
    is smoothly connected with the letter, but here it is barely not touching it,
    which looks kind of strange to me.</cite>\r\n\r\nAgain I didn't get what you thought
    before. You're right about ogonek - it usually is connected with a letter. In
    Priva in small sizes (up to cir. 10pt) it looks as connected in print-copy, so
    I'm not sure if it was intended as an ink trap - but I changed it because in larger
    sizes looked not so good - although I don't think it would confuse Polish reader.\r\n\r\nabaldoni,
    thanks for your opinion\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nAntoni"
