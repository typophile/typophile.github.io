body: "Allow me to oversimplify. Basic type design is glyphs, designing the spaces
  they occupy, and the spaces of their combinations. In addition to honing those crafts
  digitally in FontLab, must I know anything else to release a professionally crafted,
  single-weight typeface? or can I go to File/Generate Font and move on? \r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to figure out what's next on my learning curve and it seems there are a ton
  of tools tackling problems that I don't even care to understand\u2014 and maybe
  I should care. Any guidance would be appreciated, thanks."

    you've described is already plenty to keep most anybody busy for a decade or more!
    :-)  But I'd say the next qualitatively difficult step is to move from a single
    weight to a <em>system</em>. The way weights and italics need to relate can get
    complex (and there's no consensus on how to do it).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    use) the fonts in the ways you expect your customers to use them, on different
    apps and platforms, and different output devices. If you skip this step you're
    doomed to provide ongoing ad-hoc support as customers will hit issues you should
    have identified in testing. \r\n\r\n"

    outlines in \u2014 say Illustrator \u2014 I\u2019m convinced it will be taken
    from there and turned into a working and marketable OTF by eg the tech people

    to handle all of the knobs and sliders of software."

    kerning, hinting, curve quality requirements &c.

    work right?

    looking one, but it takes engineering knowledge to <em>just</em> use enough concrete.
