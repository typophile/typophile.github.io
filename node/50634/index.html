  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, first time here. Very impress with all the critiques here. You guys provided great constructive criticisms. It prompted me to post a current project that I'm in a bit of a stand still. I'm currently updating a company logo, the old one seem very out dated. The company provides medical & dental insurance so we can't really go wild on this one. It needs to be a bit conservative. Anyway, here are the various logos I came up with, I would be very appreciated if I can get any feedback to further improve the logo. Thanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_4134.gif]</div>

I don't like that "Best" is in all caps. simplify your shapes and colors. Work in black and white first, then move on to color. Nothing here is working for me yet.

		<div class="commentbody">SOme things are worth keeping like the star and probably also orange colour because it goes well with the feeling of the word best. Maybe a 0,20,100,0 (CMYK) would be even more "golden"... Otherwise they are becoming too complicated in comparison to the original one.

First step I'd do is I'd try to find a sans serif font to replace in the original logo that would go best with the star in hexagon.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know...  the elongated hexagon IS distinctive...  I do agree with the "too many elements" comments. The tagline as is is SOOO unnecessary...  reminds me of 'best little whorehouse in Texas.'  Comparisons are odious.

I'm thinking I'd like to see a nice typographic treatment of the word 'Best' inside the the hexagon (the one you've done for 'BL' is quite handsome) and then finish off with 'Life' in grey outside the hexagon (either to the right or below).

The tagline SHOULD say something...  other than what you've already said:

'BEST life and health insurance for the 21st century'

Look like everyone agreed it's way too busy, I will work on simplifying it.

Penn, I agreed with you on "BEST" doesn't need to be in all caps, but unfortunately that is how it's being use in all the collateral. Maybe I should try putting "Life" in all caps also...just like the old logo to balance it out a bit.

Chazglen, funny you mention putting the word "BEST" inside the hexagon cause that is how the original BEST life logo was created in the 70s. I did tried to update that also.

		<div class="commentbody">#1 definitely has less clutter. Tag looks somehow horizontally distorted - stretched. Maybe the logo would look better if you used larger type for your mandatory tag line. I's still consult the client whether it's possible to change it to Life and Health Insurance, because logo already reads "Best life" and company really is one thing too many.

Anyway. I'd try larger tag type that will probably span more than 1 line. I think your logo will look much better this way and you will also eliminate small size problems.

Since logos should normally evolve I'd suggest you stay with #1 and refine it.

You'll also have to do something about the star cut because you created a very thin line that may look as an error and it will probably create more bad than good.

Carry on.

I think the problem of tightness in the logotype is only exacerbated by the spine of the "B" being cropped by the box. (Things don't seem too tight in number 2.) Try spreading the box away (give the logotype some breathing room) and see if that helps ease the tightness.

I will continue to work on it whenever I have some free time at work. I want to thank everyone for their inputs, you guys been a great help & inspiration! Thank you all!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope they paid you for the work you were asked to do, even if they choose not to complete the project, or even if they choose not to use it.

Hopefully by the time this is re-opened you will have had a massive epiphany and a killer logo that will knock everything in this thread right out of the water, and I'll look forward to seeing it then!

Best of luck!</div>
