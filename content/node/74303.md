  and used fonts of the last 50 years such as Helvetica. They don't need to be exactly
  the top 10, I know there's so much to mention, but the ones that are more famous
  let's say. Do you know any?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPierluigi"

  body: I think you have a problem because during that time there is a big change
    in technology to the personal computer from the typewriter. Then you need to ask
    whether you are talking about personal and business correspondence, the screen,
    or print, or signage. Also Europe and the US are somewhat different.

  body: Maybe the point of the exercise is in fact to establish these 'types' of changes
    as mentioned by William, best bet is to choose a theme (i.e. typewriter to computer)
    and go from there, of course with good reasoning clear in your mind.

  body: "As there is no way to verify exactly the 10 (or 20, or 100) most used fonts,
    it's safer to say \"10 of the most important and used fonts for this period\".
    Trying to keep an eye in printed materials also from '60s, '70s and '80s, I think
    the list is:\r\n\r\nTimes New Roman\r\nHelvetica (Arial as a variant introduced
    with Windows dissemination)\r\nCourier New\r\nPalatino\r\nBookman\r\nSouvenir\r\nFutura\r\nFrutiger\r\nCopperplate
    Gothic\r\nGaramond (in its many variations of weight and style)\r\n\r\nOther relevant
    ones: Century Schoolbook, Century OldStyle, Sabon, Commercial Script, Minion,
    Avant Garde, Brush Script, Caslon, Eras, Bembo, Gill Sans and Univers.\r\n\r\n(My
    perception is based on Latin America, US and UK printed materials.)"

  body: "I like your idea of \"famous fonts\".\r\n\r\nBy focusing on fonts that were
    honored and acclaimed (rather than just being used a lot), it narrows the field
    to fonts that were well-respected and discussed, and which had something of a
    story and aesthetic theory attached to them, and whose designers may even have
    been known by name, in the professional fields of graphic design and typography.\r\n\r\nIt
    also means fonts that were used by typographers and designers to create layouts,
    not merely being used by readers (end-users).\r\n\r\nYou may have to say something
    about fame vs. notoriety.\r\nCertain typefaces which were much discussed were
    more vilified than respected, e.g. Souvenir, ITC Garamond, Comic Sans and Papyrus.\r\n\r\nCertainly
    Helvetica and Univers were central to design theory, as practised and taught in
    the late 20th century.\r\nAnd Futura (although designed in the 1920s).\r\n\r\nThat
    raises a good benchmark: did a typeface have a book written about it, or its designer?\r\n(Renner,
    by Christopher Burke, centres on Futura).\r\n\r\nSome of the best-known typefaces
    were well-known because their foundries were great publicists, or because their
    designers were well-known.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the 1990s, Emigre magazine,
    published by Emigre foundry, was the focus of an intellectual movement, in which
    faces like Barry Deck's Template and Zuzana Lickpo's Matrix became iconic. Dead
    History was also quite famous, theoretically, although little used.\r\n\r\nNeville
    Brody's Industria was symbolic, in many ways, of design in the 1980s and 1990s,
    first as the face of the influential magazine he art directed (The Face), then
    as one of the most-used early DTP faces. \"The Graphic Language of Neville Brody\"
    was a best-selling graphic design book, further cementing the fame of Industria
    and its designer.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Avant Garde was famous because of the iconic
    (that word again), eponymous magazine, and its much-awarded designer, Herb Lubalin.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Meta, by Erik Spiekermann, perhaps owes something of its fame (quite apart from
    its popularity in use) to its designer's career and celebrity as a graphic designer,
    author, conference speaker, and founder of FontShop.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Georgia and Verdana are landmark typefaces, IMHO. These were a concerted effort
    to address mostly screen use, the Web, and across the board interoperability.
    Something out of the Emigre fold is also landmark. Add to that Garamond, Caslon,
    Bodoni, and Baskerville, which were all quite a bit older but workhorse types
    used for quite a bit.  Bodoni more for display than text. I would also add OCR,
    Times and Futura

    the first family to include both a serif and a sans might make the list as well.
