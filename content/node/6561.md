  body: Did you double check that little attachment wire? Mine set up seamlessly once
    I got everything connected, but I struggled with that wire at first. It was the
    only component that didn&#39;t feel right when I attached it, even though it was.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, is this on a tower or a laptop?

  body: its a G4, I think maybe the connection in the G4 is damaged. the strange thing
    is that the CDROM drive doesn&#39;t work when the airport card is pluged in!

  body: Hmmm. That&#39;s bad news. Perhaps you have a power supply problem. If not
    enough power is going to the machine, it may only have enough for a few components.
    That&#39;s just a shot in the dark, though.
