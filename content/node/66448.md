body: "I\u2019m designing a book (cover and inside) for a friend. It is WW2 shipwreck
  story, and the author really wants to emphasise authenticity. I thought using a
  font that was usual for newspapers in that era (at least for the cover, but maybe
  through the book as well) could be a way to convey this authenticity.\r\n\r\nI have
  some scans of newspapers clippings which I put through WhatTheFont. (I\u2019m a
  novice graphic designer, so my type history probably isn\u2019t as good as it should
  be!). I don\u2019t know how accurate WhatTheFont is, and maybe they don\u2019t even
  exist in digital versions. Also, communication is the main goal here, so if I can
  find a good font that is close enough for the target audience to recognise it I
  would be happy with that as well.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHere are the fonts that WhatTheFont
  suggested:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/madame-sh/medium-con/\">Madame
  SH-Medium Con</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/moderno/bold/\">Moderno
  FB Cond Bold</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/century-no1-sb/bold/\">Century
  No1 SB-Bold</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-725/bold-condensed/\">Century
  725 Bold Condensed</a></li>\r\n<li>Century Condensed Bold</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLooking
  at it, it to me seems a bit like a modern serif like Didot, but much more sturdier
  and less delicate. I was thinking of going with some variant of Century. If that
  is indeed a good idea, which is the best cut to go by (for headlines), and are there
  fonts that work well with this that I can use to set the body text?  I see Adobe
  has 2 version of Century (Old Style and Expanded) which are described as good text-fonts.\r\n\r\nThese
  are probably all stupid questions, but I would appreciate any help!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  sorry if this one belongs more in design that Type ID. Wasn\u2019t sure where to
  put it."

  body: It's the old ATF foundry face Century Bold. The third one in your list, Century
    No1 SB-Bold is a digital version of it. Bitstream's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/bold/">Century
    Expanded Bold</a> is another.

  body: "Authenticity is a tricky thing. You have to consider the difference between
    what fonts were actually used in the 1940s versus what fonts people <em>feel</em>
    were used at that time - possibly pretty close, but possibly quite different.\r\n\r\nSo
    I might actually look more at things that people remember seeing regularly about
    the 40s - not fonts, but buildings, cars, etc. From there I would try to find
    fonts that evoke those visual ideas.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when it comes to choosing
    a text face for the body of the book, there's a severe limit to how stylistically
    relevant that era's fonts are in conveying that era <em>today</em>. Text works
    on a very \"detached\" level.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Hope I can find an excuse to buy it.)\r\n\r\nhrant: Thank you for advice, I will
    keep it in mind.\r\n\r\nriccard0: Thanks for the link and the eassay. Very interesting,
    and beautifully designed."
