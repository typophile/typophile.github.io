Depends on who you ask. 

But, I kind of doubt it would make a difference. I assume the EULA is box-centric rather than OS centric. Your 'mac' would 'own' the license, so it'd be fine for the fonts to be used on there.

"ersion of MS Office for OS X… that is, if they plan on continuing support for it."

Considering it's the biggest selling software product for Macs, I assume MS would have no problems continuing to sell it to us. ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No need for all that messing about - On the Intel Macs you have the option of running bootcamp or Parallels so you should be able to install Vista and copy the fonts. Don't ask me if that's legal though cos I don't know.

But I would imagine Vista fonts will become available for the Mac sooner or later. If you consider how many agencies recommended Verdana as a corporate font when creating identities, then it will only be a matter of time before those same agencies realise there's a new bunch of system fonts they can use to "differentiate thier client's communications".

What scares you? It's installed on a separate partition under bootcamp, how can that affect the OSX Partition?

Been running the RTM version on a crappy Toshiba laptop for the past few months, and haven't had any issues or needed any new drivers.

		<div class="commentbody">> Has anyone here moved to Vista yet?
I have upgraded and it's worth it. The system fonts, the default browser fonts, and reader fonts all look the same or better with Vista's CT. Since all I do on windows though is look at fonts, and use them, it's easy to do the upgrade. ;)

> I’m very interested to hear what type users are experiencing with it, and the 
> new fonts.
I'm pleased l that the browser (IE.X?) still lets the user have control of the font calls, (via "fonts" "Accessibility" in the "internet options"). So, if you set the browser font to a C-font, and "don't let web pages spec fonts" all of them look about as good as each other, but much better than the defaults set by most html or browser settings.

>I’m Mac and wont use windows, but I’d like to try their fonts. 
Aside from the legal issues, you'll find that they are less Mac-adapted in their current form than Georgia or Verdana were, so, set Quartz to 6 for best results. The optimum size, though I only checked one, is likely to be "13" on the Mac. Otherwise, (i.e. Scaling up), they behave like any other unhinted TT in Quartz.</div>

- Apple's Sigma Tel audio drivers don't work in Vista (Sigma Tel doesn't support drivers or consumers)
- Apple's Bluetooth drivers don't work in Vista
- Apple's Startup disk in Control Panel doesn't work in Vista (you use the alt key on restart to select boot device).
- Netgear's WG511v1.1 wireless network card don't work in Vista
- Microsoft's Visual Studio .net 2003 doesn't install on Vista and isn't supported.
- the SSH Client 3.2.9 non-commercial from http://www.ssh.com/ doesn't work
- Ipswich WS_FTP you need the commercial version with SSH support and the Vista upgrade for it to work.
- FontLab 4.6 may not install on Vista (I couldn't get it to install but 5.0.2 is fine)
- MS Font Validator works fine as long as you have .net 1.1 framework installed.

		<div class="commentbody">I've fixed all my Vista related issues when running on an Alienware Area-51M 766. 

I had to upgrade Ipswich WS_FTP to Pro but that was good since it supports SSH. 

Main problem was the Nvidia driver, the upgrade needed an updated .ini file that tells the installer that the driver supports my video card.

http://vinceconnare.wordpress.com/

once I fixed the video driver it was fine. The only thing I find now is Haupaugge's WinTV (which is a bit rubbish) doesn't work with the new Media Centre, WinTV boots on start-up and locks it from being used in Media Centre. But that's not a big deal.

It depends on what you want to do. I would think only in some very specific cases will you have issues with Vista.

I like using MS Visual Studio 2003 for a lot things like webpages and some Python but 2003 isn't supported so I do my work on XP.

The other is I wanted to use a MacBook Pro as my main PC and Vista is too weird on that so WinXP works fine and that is what I had to put on that. But this is also not a normal requirement.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow I tried Parallel.. and tried to use my WinXP but the mouse died... So I wiped out the Bootcamp partition and started over with Parallel. Used Custom because first time the auto install only gives you 512mb RAM and a small amount of maximum disk space. You can set up 1.5gig of RAM and 50gig of disk space. 

Vista works and the drivers work. You might need to install them manually within Parallel. 

It's pretty good so far since you can flip to and from the Mac OS, it's better than the old VirtualPC of the 90s.

The only noticable thing missing is Aero, the new 3D modelling, so there are no see through windows. The Fridgettes work so you can have your prayer clock handy.
