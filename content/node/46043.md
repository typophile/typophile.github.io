body: "I think it's a font ornament/flourish but I'm not 100% sure. It could also
  be an ornament from a vector image collection. I know I've seen it many times before
  \u2013 just can't recall the name.\r\n\r\n\r\nI need it urgently so any information
  on the foundry or image source would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nscarlett"
