body: "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI am applying to a commercial real estate certificate
  program and I am picking fonts for my resume, which I must submit. I'm new to thinking
  about what fonts to use; in the past, I've stuck to either Garamond or Times New
  Roman.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n-The resume fits on one page.\r\n-I want to convey
  freshness and stability. \r\n-Most of the the experience on the resume relates to
  mapping, databases, and real estate.\r\n-I was playing around with Helvetica for
  headings, and Times New Roman for other text. It looked OK, but not great.\r\n\r\nI
  welcome suggestions. Also, I'd love links to well-designed resumes.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nRespect,\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Helvetica and Times wouldn't be my first choice (I'd rather see Helvetica
    and Garamond, if you have Garamond), but you're on the right track keepng it simple
    with two conservative fonts, a serif for the text and a sans for the titles. In
    the past I've preferred to use just a serif font, utilizing italic and/or larger
    sizes for  headings. Layout is important too: use white space to your advantage
    to set off different section and to keep it all looking open and inviting. Make
    your text large enough to be easily read (10 points or so, depending on the typeface),
    but not overly large.\r\n\r\nI've laid out my own resumes in the past using a
    two-column format: a left column, about third of the width between my outer margins,
    has my name and address at the top, and major headings (experience, education)
    beow, with the text of the sections occupying the right two thirds. This keeps
    the length of text lines to around four inches, which is easier to read than text
    spanning maybe six inches on 8.5 x 11 stock. "

  body: "Do you have a Mac or PC? Are you interested in purchasing a font or using
    one you own (have a license for)?\r\n\r\nIf you have a Mac, it ships with Hoefler
    Text (I think it still does anyway), which is excellent. If you have a PC only,
    I'd recommend using Georgia instead of Times. Georgia italics are particularly
    nice. Also, Garamond is better (fresher) than Times.\r\n\r\nFor a sans, use Helvetica,
    and avoid Verdana. \r\n\r\nInstead of the default 12 point that Word will give
    you, you'll get a more refined look with 10.5 or 11 point text. \r\n\r\nGood luck
    in your job search."

  body: "I don't agree totally with the type sizes recommended. If your resume is
    short, increase the type size. It will look bigger, and thus longer. I also want
    the interviewer to read everything, so would go with a minimum of 12 point body
    type so that they will read the whole thing. Anything smaller, IMO, will make
    them toss it if your qualifications are iffy. The larger type almost forces them
    to read it.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with Hoefler Text and Georgia, which Joe recommended.
    They are both great looking fonts, as well as being modern and easy to read.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer sanserif fonts for headlines. It is just the way I was brought up in the
    art field. I started in newspapers and always preferred the the sanserif to the
    serif fonts for headlines. It is cleaner and stands out from the body type, IMO.
    But that is not necessarily the rule, as many newspapers today use serifed faces
    for their headlines. Use what you like in that case. It really depends upon what
    you want to relate, and to whom you are relating it to. Both work well under different
    circumstances."

  body: If your resume is a bit short, I recommend NOT using a larger size of type
    to try to fill up the page---it can wind up looking like you've done so deliberately
    to overcome a perceived shortcoming. Better to use a smart design with lots of
    white space.
