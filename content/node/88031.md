  body: I'm probably wrong but it looks close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/|Alternate
    Gothic]] to me or may be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-condensed-no-20-63882/|Trade
    Gothic Condensed Bold no20]], mainly different on the /E. Even if, like you, I'm
    not sure about the apparent roundness (could be the quality of your sample), there's
    also [[http://www.linotype.com/617040/TradeGothicNextSoftRounded-family.html|Trade

  body: Nice find, fvilanakis. I've been watching this thread hoping it would get
    identified so I could see the rest of the family and look into buying it. Love
    the subtle round corners!
