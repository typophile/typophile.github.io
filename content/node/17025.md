  body: Sorry, Tiff -- I thought since Eras Light comes bundled with Publisher that
    the other might too. But as far as I can tell, no dice. None on DaFont either
    (but it sure looks free!) or on the three most likely areas of Mike's Script ID
    Guide. Wish I coulda delivered for you. Good luck, and condolences.
