body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15 AUGUST 1976_3706.png]\r\nI classified
  the typeface as 'Display' but I'm not completely sure that it is.\r\n\r\nThis typeface
  is similar to the Futura series, however the '5' is quite a rare design and the
  '9' and '6' are different to what is common with Futura."

    and the shape of the 5, are still off): \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/twentieth-century-mt/\r\n\r\nThe
    5 is closer to something you'd see in Avant Garde (save for the pointed juncture
    of the bowl and vertical stroke):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/"

    body: Twentieth Century Bold looks close, but there are still quite a few differences
      such as the curved back of the '6' which also has a smaller 'hole', in fact
      the enclosed sections of all characters should be smaller.  The lower left hand
      flat section of the '3' should jut out slightly (I'll upload a few more images).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AH-1_5880.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-6_5279.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serial_5342.png]

  body: "Maybe what we're dealing with here is some knock-off of Futura (Spartan Heavy
    comes to mind, but it still isn't a perfect match--the 5, for instance).\r\n\r\nIn
    the phototypesetting era, there were often clones of famous typefaces that not
    only were given different names, but also \"improved\" on the details."

  body: "I think you may be right kthomps5.  The manual contains a couple of other
    fonts which don't seem to be available in digital format.  One of them looks almost
    identical to Garamont Amsterdam EF Medium Italic, save for a couple of very minor
    differences.  The Garamont typeface was created in 2004 however, whereas the manual
    was written in 1946.\r\nhttp://myfonts-wtf.s3.amazonaws.com/b2/b2c286799fbf380b09f0c00714980174.104577.png\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The TR Avalon at fontsplace looks like a clone of Avant Garde, designed in
    1970.\r\nAs for Spartan, this was produced in many variations from 1939 onwards
    by Bauer & Linotype, as a knockoff of Futura. Only two versions have been digitized,
    as Book and Heavy\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpartanBookNumbers_6172.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpartanHeavyNumbers_3638.gif]
    For _5_, top but not bottom is similar to your manual. For _6_ some curvature
    of the back, but not as much as your manual. No real difference from Futura.\r\nIt's
    almost as if the font designer took the bottom of a Futura _3_ and pasted it on
    _5_ or lifter the bottom of the _5_ in Helvetica.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaBoldNumbers_6410.gif]\r\nDon"
