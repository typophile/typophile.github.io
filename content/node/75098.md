  (after copying) as suggested in the fontlab manual?\r\n\r\nhas anyone played around
  with making new tools for fontlab?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Tim- they are showing up as available and i can edit them in the built in
    editor but...\r\n\r\nwhen I press 'run', no cursor change occurs like when they
    were in their original spot - (the leftmost side of the macro toolbar) \r\n\r\nor..
    is this just not possible. do I need to keep the 'tools' in the 'tool' folder
    within the program files?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat job on the font RMX tools btw
    Tim :) enjoying the demo\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: "Michael,\r\n\r\nin the official FontLab terminology, \"Macro Tools\" are
    a special category of macro. This is a bit confusing since all macros could be
    called tools \u2013 the RMX Tools are not \"Macro Tools\" in a FontLab sense,
    however.\r\n\r\n\"Macro Tools\" have to stay in the /System/Tool folder or they
    won't work. Unlike normal macros, they will appear on the left of the Macro toolbar,
    they only work in the Glyph window and they are started (rather than \"run\")
    by clicking on the arrow button on the very left, not the play button.\r\n\r\nThis
    whole \"Macro Tools\" thing does not seem to be widely used, and it is hardly
    documented. I am working on one, which will hopefully be part of RMX some day."
