  font on my PC, a link led me to typophile, where I read with interest several threads.
  What&#39;s troubling Miriam? a&#41; the characters don&#39;t print &#40;instead,
  the little boxes do&#41; and b&#41; the letter i usually shows up as I on the screen.
  Is it possible this face is corrupted?

  body: Hi John, <BR> <BR>Miriam is a Hebrew font, are you trying to use the Hebrew
    characters? If not you&#39;re seeing a fall back font, Arial or Microsoft Sans
    Serif. The &#39;i&#39; problem is probably your app auto-correcting - you should
    be able to turn this off. <BR> <BR>Si

  body: If you have MS font properties extension installed on your Windows, hitting
    alt&#43;enter on the font will show you that hebrew is one of the supported code
    pages for that font. You must have Hebrew enabled to use it &#40;and the letter
    i is really ovelapping a Hebrew letter that might look like lower case l.

  body: Heh. Just as Simon and Svika say. Per your recommendations, I installed the
    &#34;font properties extension&#34;. The Miriam fonts, 4 in all, are from Glyph
    Systems, as are 3 David fonts, also for Hebrew. My guess is they came in with
    Explorer&#39;s Hebrew support. Merci.
