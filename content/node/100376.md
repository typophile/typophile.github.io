  to it's expression. Perhaps something like this...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/blackletter_textura.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAnd
  the /G/ must be legible at quick first glace.\r\n\r\nAnd hopefully it's not one
  of those free ones that I've seen every wheres. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Thanks for the comment hhp. I have checked around and it does seem that letterpress
    printer's costs are somewhat challenging. Fortunately business cards are a business
    expense, and as such part of which can treated as a tax deduction.  \r\n\r\nBlackletter,
    when done well, does seem to separate the pretenders from the contenders. There
    are a lot of well known global brands that have not been seduced by the strumpets
    of lower case sans serif ...as tempting as they seem at first blush.\r\n\r\nn.

    any combination of impression depth and color (sometimes by making two passes).
    But a good letterpress printer is hard to find/afford - most of them are sensationalist
    hacks who treat type like a sledgehammer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    online even though my google savvy is crisp.\r\n\r\nSo I gave Carter & Cone Type
    Inc a call, Cone of Carter & Cone is sending over a PDF sometime soon I hope.
    And I just like say that it was a pleasure speaking with her!!\r\n\r\nI have to
    tell tho that as a graphic designer/creative genius I'm just a tourist amongst
    you typeheads so I really had no idea who Carter is ...until now. And just looking
    through everything substantive I could find online about the man ...wow... this
    guy is awesome!!\r\n\r\nthx.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\nps. not saying that the sale is
    a done deal, I've got my standards too, somewhat..."

    was kind enough to send over some characters from one of his textura faces that
    is still deep in development. And if that's not coolio enough, he has allowed
    me the latitude I might need to play. \r\n\r\nI'm now that much closer ...I think.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I found nice book (rather pages there of) on Google about  blackletter...\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.ca/books?id=9qU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PR18&lpg=PR18&dq=Hendrik+van+den+Keere&source=bl&ots=qt-UpkTWGn&sig=KWanxj5ddSwpgbHLW7j1z4b7fzU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eo8pUab9BuOO2wXTjICoCg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Hendrik%20van%20den%20Keere&f=false\r\n\r\n...in
    particular a bit about distinct national differences between French, German and
    Dutch textura (pgs42-45).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nn.  "

    I've decided to go with the 220 lbs (600 gsm) Lettra Fluorescent White. \r\n\r\nNow
    with the card stock in hand I can push forward my business card design, ya! It
    will have three components to it. One side letter pressed with, Graphic Declaration,
    rendered in textura blackletter. The other side will have a quick services mention
    and contact info, rendered in sans serif which I'm considering hand stamping.
    And the card stock edges will be painted either neon green, or red, or black.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all the assistance.\r\n\r\nn."
