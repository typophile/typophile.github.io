  that spacing it and setting sidebearing values it\xB4s much different than in the
  roman version,\r\nI\xB4m getting the feeling that it\xB4s even a little bit difficult
  and tricky to get nice results... The sidebearings for each character, even the
  ones with simillar shapes, always come out with diferent values, and i can\xB4t
  use round numbers.\r\nIs there any good set of rules or any kind of info that could
  point me out in the right direction?\r\n\r\nAs a biginner, any help would be very
  apreciated,\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nBest regards "

  body: I find that making a temporary glyph in the shape of a parallelogram (same
    angle as the slant of your font, sides crossing the sidebearings at exactly half
    the x-height) helps.

    sample text.\r\nTrust your eyes.\r\nStudy Helvetica and Futura.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nOne
    trick: make all the sidebearings so that everything just touches, then space out.\r\n"
