body: I&#39;ve been reading the posts and archives and have found much of what I need.  But
  I wonder if some of you could help me.  I have been working with a partner doing
  architectural photography and this has expanded into a limited design company.  <BR>
  <BR>I felt strongly that I needed to expand my type collection.  I have the fonts
  that come with Photoshop CS and other versions and the Adobe Type Classic Collection
  and have been following your advice to shop around and buy fonts you like and I
  have bought a lot!   <BR> <BR>But I wonder if there are some basic, useful fonts
  you would find indispensible in your collections and also the fonts you like the
  most. <BR> <BR>I know I will have to buy some fonts specifically to meet a customer&#39;s
  needs.  I will spend another $500-$1,000 &#40;preferably the 500&#41; at this time
  on my general type collection and want to make sure that what i have is representative
  of a quality selecion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using Windows.   <BR> <BR>Thanks for reading
  this and for any help you can give me. <BR> <BR>Sharon <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I would recommend buying one of the following four packages &#40;and
    then using the rest of your money to buy from some independent foundries, like

  body: Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>I bought a font from you when your website had just come
    online.  Your service was wonderful and I have several more of your fonts on my
    list. <BR> <BR>Dan, <BR> <BR>I wish I had asked this question earlier.  I have
    some of these fonts, but these packages look good. I agree about Conrad. <BR>
    <BR>Our business is based in Nantucket and that name is used a lot in business
    names.  I&#39;ve tried to find some fonts that show the Nantucket name as well
    as indicate the history and heritage of the island.  I&#39;m considering MVB Chanson

  body: When I started out, I purchased the Bitstream Full Library  <BR>on CD-ROM
    to make sure I had access to equivalents of the  <BR>&#34;standard&#34; typefaces
    plus a whole bunch of really cool fonts <BR>for a more than reasonable price.
    I haven&#39;t regretted that  <BR>purchase ever since and upgraded to Bitstream&#39;s
    TypeHigh  <BR>CD-ROM when it came out not so long ago. <BR> <BR>For the rest I
    concentrate on truly original and distinctive  <BR>type families. <BR> <BR>Dan,
    I&#39;m pleasantly surprised about the pricing of these  <BR>Linotype collections.
    It appears Linotype faces aren&#39;t as  <BR>expensive anymore as they used to
    be.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also looking at 3islandpress fonts.  They
    have New England influenced type.   <BR> <BR>This is hard but it&#39;s so much

  body: Sharon, if you want New England, you really should look more into Font Bureau
    &#40;<a href="http://www.fontbureau.com" target="_blank">www.fontbureau.com</a>
    Boston&#41;, or anything from Tobias Frere-Jones at Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones
    Typography &#40;<a href="http://www.typography.com" target="_blank">www.typography.com</a>&#41;.
    Bitstream is in New England, too... and MyFonts... at least they&#39;re <i>headquartered</i>
    in Cambridge.  <BR> <BR>After having lived in Providence for four years, I really
    get a kick out of the Providence Type Foundry &#40;<a href="http://www.provtype.com/index2.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.provtype.com/index2.html</a>&#41;, too; or at least
    its font names. <BR> <BR>Unfortuantely, I can&#39;t say that Linotype has anything
    distinctly &#34;New England.&#34; We do sell a lot of typefaces to New Englanders,
    though. <BR> <BR>Yves, I think that <b>all</b> of Linotype&#39;s products are
    reasonalbly priced now &#40;no, I&#39;m not saying this just because I work in
    the <i>marketing</i> department&#41;. I mean, the gold edition will still set
    you back 10 grand, but it is ENORMOUS.  <BR> <BR>Most of the font collections
    are very nicely priced. The Take Type Collections <a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html</a> <BR>are really
    broad, with a lot of one-off display faces, but they all have a few good text
    families &#40;including the first appearance of Conrad, on Take Type 3!&#41;.
    Our new special packs sell five or six fonts apiece, at an average of 6 EUR a
    font, I think. <a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Plus, we will soon be offering student discounts &#40;if we haven&#39;t
    had them before&#41; <BR> <BR>And in the name of good, fair competition, I should
    add that the best of Unger&#39;s fonts are available from us, too ;&#41;

  body: Thanks so much,  <BR> <BR>I like a lot of the Font Bureau collections but
    I think I like the Myfonts Linotype collection better to start with.  That and
    the Storm czech collection. I can add some more individual fonts. <BR>The Unger
    fonts were very nice. <BR> <BR>I appreciate the help you have all given me in
    sorting this out.   <BR> <BR>Sharon
