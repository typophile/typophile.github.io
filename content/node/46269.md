  the meantime as I prepare, I wonder: do you have any advice for me about St. Petersburg?
  AtypI? Cusine? Pre-AtypI tourisim? Anything else? \r\n\r\nFeel free to reply here

    that just says \"bump\". But i don't know if tracking was key to that or if they
    just wanted to re-draw attention to the thread. In terms of a silent method -
    I don't think there is one. Maybe there can be in the future. Thanks Paul! Paul,
    can I assume you will be there too?\r\n\r\nMy current thinking is to add two or
    three extra days to the trip at the beginning to see the Hermitage and perhaps
    Spas na Krovi etc. Is anybody else thinking of doing this? Maybe I can get into
    the slipstream of Maxim's entourage..."

  body: i'm hoping to make to St. Petersburg, it's been almost 10 years since i was
    there last... The Hermitage is a very good choice. There are lots of amazing things
    to do in St. Petersburg. You can always IM me and I'll try to make recommendations
    for what you're interested in.

  body: "\"...people make a post that just says \u201Cbump\u201D.\"\r\n\r\nThat is
    usually to move a thread up on the recent posts list and give it some attention.
    I got in the habit of posting the word \"Tracking\" to tag a thread. This usually
    prompts David Berlow to make a humorous comment regarding typographic tracking
    so I kept doing it--hoping David would keep posting funny comments and he did!

  body: I have been checking around and it turns out that you can get ( barring a
    substantial currency exchange shift ) a room for AtypI for as little as $150 without
    going the full on hostel route. Now, can they get you the right paperwork for
    a visa?... that's a different question. I hope AtypI comes out with partner hotel
    info soon.

  body: "I'm getting going to please Joe, but I'm never talking about tracking again,
    Ever.:)\r\n\r\nI've been wisely advised: don't take any hardware you cannot afford
    to loose completely. Don't take any software you can't afford to turn over to
    a complete stranger, with all ownership rights, for free. Don't buy anything that
    looks old and try to bring it home; the customs chaps have a vague rule about
    antiquities export protection in their holsters and if they or their wife or mom
    want what you got, they enforce. Don't ever use credit cards or give anyone any
    numbers. Make sure a witness is with you if you ever need to give up your passport
    to anyone for any reason. \r\n\r\n.gov has much more to say, much of which is
    so diplomatically phrased, you might miss it.;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    think. It seem like there is often a presentation notebook at these things. If
    we can get a copy of Keynote on it then I will be happy, although maybe Keynote
    exports to PP format...
