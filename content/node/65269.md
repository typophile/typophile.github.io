  body: "Old style or transitional with grotesque?\r\nThat's like harp with saxophone--interesting
    contrast but a little offbeat.\r\nThe classic combination for a late 19th century
    sans serif would be a <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">modern</a>
    face.\r\nIf by solid you mean chunky, then a Century or a Clarendon would be a
    good choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
