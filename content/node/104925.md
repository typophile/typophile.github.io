body: "Hello, first time poster here! :)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some critique on the
  typesetting & layout of this white paper. Initially I wanted to do a two-column
  layout, but the text has so many breaks that the columns didn't flow very nicely,
  so I'm kinda stuck with one-column, which seems a bit boring to me.\r\n\r\nThe fonts
  used are Neutraface 2, Belizio, and Chronicle Text for the main copy. This will
  be mainly for screen reading (that may change) so I didn't do facing-pages.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments/critiques are welcome!"

  body: I think the italic text in the boxes could be made more legible if it was
    less bold. The justified text creates some issues with gaps between words which
    also makes the line spacing seem large.
