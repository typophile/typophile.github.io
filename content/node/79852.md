  body: "This inline style is not hard to reproduce using Illustrator or Corel Draw.
    Spotting a condensed unicase gothic, you'd just have to set main color to transparent
    and add one to stroke. Then, vectorize text and remove all finial strokes to recreate
    this exact style (\"gas-pipe\").\r\nYou can also have a look to some tags at MyFonts:
