  I came across this book in a shelf. The title page caught my attention because of
  a peculiar hyphen.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe compound \"Mynt-Cabinettet\" (Coin Cabinet)
  has the hyphen positioned on the baseline. Has anyone seen something like this before?
  Is it common? I assume the placement of the hyphen is due to the following C.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baseline-hyphen_5000.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  apologise for the poor quality of the picture, taken with my five-year-old Nokia.
  I did not think to write down the text, because I was sure I would be able to read
  it in the picture. Anyway, I believe the book is a late 19th century publication,
  possibly early 20th."
