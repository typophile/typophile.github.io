  body: "IIRC, the Blaktur CD by House Industries came with an installer. Shouldn't
    be too hard to build on a Mac if you have the dev tools installed. I don't know
    about other systems though. There probably will be users who need to install the
    fonts on a system you haven't thought of ;)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like installers.
    Just give me the plain font files ;) But for novice users it may be easier than
    to install fonts manually."

  body: Why would anyone be using a font installer in 2011? On Windows Vista, 7, and
    all version of Mac OS X the system includes tools for installing fonts, either
    through double clicking on by selecting the fonts and using a menu to install
    them. It is not possible to make the process easier.

  body: "There are still some stupid bugs when it comes to installing fonts. For example,
    on Windows 7 you still can't drag a font from a double-clicked zip file into the
    Windows fonts folder. You have to drag it to another folder first, and then into
    the fonts folder.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS Lion the user's fonts folder is inside the
    hidden Library folder.\r\n\r\nI never use the \xBBdouble click and then click
    the install button\xAB way, but I agree, if users can double click on an installer,
    they can also double click on the fonts ;)"
