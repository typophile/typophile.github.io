body: "Years ago I built a bitmap font (ttf outlines) which I would like to use for
  web embedding in html now.\r\n\r\nThe font\u2014like most bitmap fonts available
  back then\u2014was set to be displayed at 8px size which in case of this font is
  visually roughly an equivalent of 12px Helvetica.\r\n\r\nMy question is: \r\n\r\nIs
  there an easy way to change the font's metrics so that its px size would be more
  accurate when used in html? \r\n\r\nIt still would only have one native size (as
  it is a bitmap font), but it wouldn't require displaying at 8px in order to be shown
  at its native 12px anymore.\r\n\r\nWhat metrics should I change?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any information."

    scaling the outlines). Such a non-standard Em won't be a problem these days.\r\n\r\nI'd
    be interested in seeing the results.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
