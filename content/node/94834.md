  body: "It's pretty nice. Regarding customization and choosing the right fonts is
    tough however it's up to your preferences you can use software like adobe photoshop
    to determine what's the best font and you can also consult with your friends or
    family if possible. - <a href=\"http://www.americasinstantsigns.com/products/illuminated/channel-letters/\"
