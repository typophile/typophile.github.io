  Issue).This is a part of my publication design class to identify all these fonts
  and then rework on the whole layout of the page. I though its DIN but the dots(full
  stop) in the din are rounded and here its not.\r\n\r\nPlz answer the one which is
  circled in the red.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\nsatya\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/for
