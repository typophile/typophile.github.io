  \r\n\r\nAwesome!\r\n\r\nTypography on an Easter Egg! Otherwise known as Easter Egg
  Typography or EET. Whether it be TEE or EET, this awesome challenge has two categories!!
  Typography drawn directly on a whole egg shell just like traditional Easter Egg
  decorating (except now you buy plastic egg shells and they will be accepted in this
  challenge too) - or - typography drawn in the form of an Easter Egg. Either one
  is totally awesome!! Bonus points if you can submit both :)!!\r\n\r\nThe Typophile
  powers that be will have to sign off on this awesome type battle, but here are the
  details copy/pasted the Type Battle Forum...\r\n\r\n// REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- Image
  size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi\r\n- Color: Any\r\n- Format: JPG or PNG\r\n\r\nI
  suggest a nice long timeline starting NOW and ending 11:59:59 PM PST, April 8th
  2012.\r\n\r\n???"

  body: "Good initiative, but, regardless of what it says on the Typebattles main
    page (http://typophile.com/typebattles), there already is (was?) a #40 (http://typophile.com/battle40).\r\nSo
    your proposed one should be #41.\r\n\r\nAs for the theme, reading the title, I
    thought you meant a typography piece with an hidden message (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29).
    Like the classic FedEx logo."

    egg of a different stripe.\r\n\r\nEggcited to see what comes up.\r\n\r\n"
