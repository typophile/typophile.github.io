  us at Adobe, I think these days we are down to only a couple of new type families
  each year (not counting non-western designs).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I'd suggest asking Lorp how many faces and families get added to MyFonts
    each year. Of course MyFonts doesn't carry everything, but that would be countered
    by the old stuff they add as other designers join their ranks - so I'd guess that
    the yearly total would be pretty accurate. \r\n\r\nAnother idea might be to ping
    the ATypI country delegates - but being one myself I don't have a number for the
    country I represent. "

  body: "The payment is nice, even if it is 90 days later :)\r\nFor me with custom
    work, the deadline seems to speak the loudest. On my self iniated work, I'm prone
    to let time work out the problems, maybe let a font simmer on the back burner
    for awhile. I can only paraphrase, but about 5 years ago Eye magazine featured
    a Gerard Unger interview in which he mentioned having to build in time for reflection
    as a way to counteract the sometimes speedy process of drawing glyphs. "

  body: "I said I touched 200 fonts last year. I touched them for different reasons.
    Sometimes its hinting, sometimes its changing font formats, sometimes its adding
    extra glyphs, sometimes its designing new weights, and sometimes its designing
    new fonts. The work could take several minutes to several weeks. I have on occasion
    drawn a complete Type1 character set over the weekend, and kerned it on Monday,
    but I agree with Eric, that it is important for reflection. So you do wind up
    saving the reflection for your own work. Your custom clients are not paying you
    to reflect.\r\n\r\nJames"
