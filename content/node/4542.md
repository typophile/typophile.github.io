body: I find that when I am absorbed laying out type <BR>or making glyphs in FL I
  come up with rough <BR>theories/ideas/saying pertaining to typography. <BR>None
  of which are proven, just a sudden thought. <BR>I was wondering if anyone has little
  snippets  <BR>of ideas they would share. They don&#39;t have to <BR>be right, just
  more or less your own!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll start. &#34;The perfect glyph only ever
  exists <BR>within its own family &#40;context&#41;, never outside&#34;

  body: The idea &#34;singularities&#34; that are most memorable to me seem to be
    the ones most paradoxical. For example that &#34;a text font has to have a certain
    ugliness about it&#34;, or that &#34;you can never <i>show</i> a concept, you
    can only <i>explain</i> it&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hehe, this is fun. In my deconstructivist days I once devised a  <BR>mathematical
    equation which &#34;proved&#34; there is a fixed relationship  <BR>between text
    colour, character size and difficulty of setting&#42; if you  <BR>want to achieve
    satisfying readability. For example if the type  <BR>becomes &#39;lighter&#39;&#40;less
    contrast with background or surroundings&#41;  <BR>you either have to make the
    type bigger or simplify the typesetting. <BR> <BR>&#42;now <i>that</i> is a concept
    I can only show, not explain <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
