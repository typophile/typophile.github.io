body: "I've been handed a report in a Microsoft Word Document, and I want to recreate
  it in InDesign. I'm not opposed to hand copy-transfer page per page (I'm going to
  be reformatting everything anyway.) I'm more concerned about creating a linked TOC.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the current TOC from the word doc:\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\nExecutive Summary\ti\r\nAcknowledgements\tiii\r\nList

  Word. I want to recreate that in InDesign, so page numbers, section numbers and
  even tables and Figures update automatically on the TOC as I add or remove them.
  \r\n\r\nWhere should I start? Put in all content then add a TOC later? I'm familiar
  with Pagination, but not with Sectioning.\r\n"

  body: 'It''s a starting point, Florian. I''ve never created a "live" TOC before.
    If it was just being printed, it would be easy as pie, but they want PDFs with
    quick links and stuff.  '
