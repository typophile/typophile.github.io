body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nis there a software where I can just load a font and
  say \"make thicker\"?\r\nFor laser cutting purposes most fonts often have too thin
  lines and this makes it hard to get decent results.\r\nSince I don't want to edit
  each letter by hand - is there a software that can do this automatically?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance\r\nBest\r\nDan\r\n"

    know I know - I can adjust the thickness in Illustrator.\r\nBut I need it to be
    visual before I import the design in Illustrator.\r\nThats why the font must be
    thickened.\r\n"

  body: "In Fontlab  select and open one test glyph to make bold:\r\nFrom the main
    menu: Tools / Actions / Effects / Bold .  In the panel that opens try some value
    for H weight and  the same for V weight, click  both 'keep glyph dimensions' and
    \ 'change weight of the glyph'/OK.  \r\nCommand Z to return to the original size.\r\n
    Experiment with various  H=V values until you determine the right amount of fat
    needed. Then click 'apply to entire font' /OK.\r\nVoila "

    body: ..however you have to review the resulting glyph outlines. This process
      sometimes creates extra shapes where the outline bends sharply.  In Fontlab
      there is another way - expand the path - this creates a double outline and you
      delete the inner outline.

  body: I guess you know that within illustrator, you can convert the type to paths,
    then use the function "offset path" to make it thicker.
