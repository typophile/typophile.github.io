body: 'This redesign is for a dinnerware company that&#39;s been around for about
  25 years.  The product selection runs the gamit from &#34;grandma&#34;-type patterns
  and glassware with dated-looking flowery designs to square-shaped dishes with more
  modern flair.  They want to change their look to be more &#34;hip&#34; and &#34;youthful&#34;
  and get rid of all the old-style products.  The parent company is conservative and
  they don&#39;t want wacky typefaces and electronic looking graphics. <BR> <BR>The
  existing logo is the thin one.  I think the typeface is AVANT GARDE.  The powers
  that be felt that the thin type disappears when the logo is placed onto photography
  and also  no one likes it...hence, this redesign. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s new &#34;brand
  personality&#34; is as follows:  <BR>&#34;The bold alternative brand that fits the
  changing lifestyles of each new generation&#34;.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what
  that means, but this is a new direction that they want this brand to be.  So they
  gave it some brand values: &#34;bold&#34;; &#34;savvy&#34;; &#34;edgy&#34;, &#34;challenging
  the status quo&#34; and &#34;affirming one&#39;s originality&#34;.  I didn&#39;t
  come up with this. <BR> <BR>I, personally, didn&#39;t want to stray too far from
  it&#39;s original look.  &#40;Keeping in mind the Mandarina Duck redesign, K-Mart
  and the more recent, Sears.  I used a combination of FUTURA BOLD and AVANT GARDE
  BOLD. <BR>Anyhow, here are some idea for you guys and gals to pick apart.   <BR>
  <BR>Thanks.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67830.jpg" alt="StudioNova">'

  body: i don&#39;t like 1, 2 or 3 where the NOVA is below Studio. i think it would
    be best to keep it horizontal, on one line. the ones with the large circle seem
    to be calling for too much attention and i&#39;m not diggin it. number 4 is the
    best to me, but it&#39;s not perfect yet, and maybe it could use another element
    of some sort. maybe a single extra color.

  body: The old logo looks 25 years old. Very experimental ITC looking. Problem is
    it doesn&#39;t read. I totally agree with Loren. Think about one application you
    mentioned, etching the logo legiblity in glass. I kind of like 5, but with these
    changes. Make NOVA bold, make studio either smaller or medium weight and not italic.
    I&#39;d also open up the letter spacing. I personally don&#39;t think the word
    studio is as important as NOVA and would reflect that in the new mark.

  body: 'I prefer #4. Most of these say TV studio or movie studio to me, but that
    may be the word &#39;studio&#39; more than anything else. Have you considered
    putting the joined &#39;VA&#39; back in the logo? The joined characters seems
    like a big part of the old logo. <BR> <BR>However, I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re
    ever going to fit their new brand concepts with straight Futura or Avant Garde.
    It might help to find a typeface that has geometric construction, but isn&#39;t
    as common/dated. <a href="http://emigre.com/">Emigre</a> might be a good place
    to start looking for funkier, &#39;edgier&#39; geometric fonts. They may not be
    100% fresh, but they&#39;re much newer, younger and edgier than Futura. <BR> <BR>Also,
    a sample search on<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=geometric&amp;itemsperpage=100&amp;resultcount=460&amp;source=MyFonts.com&amp;page=1">MyFonts</a>
    can be great for logotypes.'
