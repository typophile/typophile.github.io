  I remember there used to be an application called PosterMaker or something similar
  that could handle very large vector graphics.\r\n\r\nAnything like that in use now?"

    applicated at the printer.\r\n\r\ni know, thats not the answer you want, but thats
    a possible way to do it."

  body: The whole point of vector graphics is that they scale to any size, so no need
    to work at 'actual' size in the first place.

  body: "Thanks. I do know what vector graphics are about, but I don't trust printers.
    If I can say 100% that gives the person running the RIP 0% chance of screwing
    up. Somehow the kerning feels funny to knowing you are working at a reduced size.
    Anyway, this stuff is 30ft wide so my hand is forced.\r\n\r\nBTW I'm looking at
    the character set in Apex New. Nice job Chester. I don't know what you call the
    superscript lc letters that are included but what a nice feature, and a nice guy."

    seriously though, if you contact the printer and ask them what they want in terms
    of artwork then the ball is in their court, I usually name my file, something
    like \u2013 XXXX_2700x5000mm@25%.ai \u2013 not foolproof of course.\r\n\r\nTim"
