body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nSummer's gone, and things are getting busy over at the
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">Type Identification Board</a>. In response
  to a couple of requests of people who told me the Type ID Pop Quiz is too hard and
  only fun for obsessed type nuts, I decided to crank up the game factor and add two
  more Type ID Pop Quizzes. The difference between the three is how much of the typeface
  is shown.\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27995\">Type ID Pop Quiz
  V2.1 - <strong>Entry Level</strong></a>\r\nThe challenge shows a number of words
  which may or may not provide a hint. This is the only quiz where I personally post
  all the challenges and where you need to send me the solution <strong>by e-mail</strong>
  to allow other enthusiasts to participate as well. If people come up with a fun
  challenge they can always send it to me and I can include it.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28061\">Type
  ID Pop Quiz V2.1 - <strong>Intermediate Level</strong></a>\r\nThe challenge shows
  a single glyph. The person who identifies the typeface and weight posts the new
  challenge. You can't win two games in a row (to avoid a ping pong situation where
  two people end up playing against one another).</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27994\">Type
  ID Pop Quiz V2.1 - <strong>Expert Level</strong></a>\r\nThe challenge shows a portion
  of a glyph. The person who identifies the typeface and weight posts the new challenge
  and can't win the next game (for the same reason).</li></ul>\r\nCome and join the
  fun. ;^)"

  body: Why on earth does the unordered list tag make the type smaller? Is there a
    logic behind this?
