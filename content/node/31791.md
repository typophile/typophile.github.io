  not asking what you think of it, but if you've seen it before. the square/circle
  combo i mean. I already know it resembles font bureau's logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squarecircle_3867.jpg]"

    logo isn't old: http://portal.omroep.nl/\r\n\r\nI assumed it went out with the
    restyling of a while back."

  body: Norway is not that far from Holland - When in doubt do not do it or at least
    ask client first.

  body: CTV, Canada's largest private TV network, uses a logo very similar to the
    Chazen one above, with the triangle upside down. But not so close to your concept.

  body: "When you deal with such basic geometric shapes there are limits to what you
    can do. There are only so many to work with, (3, to be precise. Or 8, when you
    include rotated squares and triangles) and just a multiple of that number of different
    ways of arranging them. I'd say it's just part of the design and not the design,
    As long as the client doesn't come out looking like the completion across the
    street and the shapes relate to the company somehow, I don't think It's an issue.\r\n
