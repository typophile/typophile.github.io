body: "I am doing a menu board for a client named Surfs Up Tanning. The menu will
  advertise their pricing for the different tanning packages they offer. I haven't
  done the typography yet, but I was wanting to get opinions on the layout. I am concerned
  the anges are too much.\r\n\r\nThe menu will be split into 2 sections. The notces
  cutout from the top of the shapes will hold the title of the section.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/menu.gif]"

    how do you post images now? I haven't been on here for awhile and I don't see
    an image upload option.)\r\n\r\nI just used a generic texture, but perhaps more
    of a sandlike texture would be appropriate\u2026or maybe a really close up view
    of some tanned skin.\r\n\r\nAloha."

  body: Call me crazy but I think the slight funkiness of your first menu works better
    than the boring second one. The logo doesn't have a single straight line in it,
    so why not reference the curves of the wave more? The key is not going overboard....

  body: 'Tom, the new version is cleaner and gives a direct message about their services
    and costs. It allows you to focus your design on the logo. I''m not in love with
    the gradient, I''m not sure it adds anything. You might also make a version that
    allows the prices to be blank so if the prices change the client could take the
    blanks and put them into a printer and print out the new prices. '

  body: "Some of the suggestions by Dan (Madden) and Scott offer you opportunities
    that I think you need to exploit, to me the logo is relegated by its present location/background
    to an afterthought, removing the background or some form of curve to the box would
    serve it better. Those backgrounds have that fifties textile design feel to them
    that is a characteristic of House, but not entirely suitable for this use (the
    fifties style is increased by the offset borders to your boxes), I think that
    a closeup view of tanned skin or an abstract soft focus texture in that vein would
    serve better.\r\nTim"

  body: "This is definitely moving forward. Good stuff, Tom. Now that you've got some
    good character in the menu area, the red block with the logo's starting to feel
    too slick and empty. How about using a Hawaiian shirt pattern in the red area,
    with the pattern at a 85\u201390% of the red area? It would give texture and character
    to the red field but won't interfere unduly with the logo. This would take that
    surf feel an extra step. This might even work in the table areas, too. Take it
    all the way.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about using the skin as a background. Unless
    you have the budget for it, I think you'll have a hard time not having it come
    out weird from stock photos.\r\n\r\nOne last thing, I think the horizontal rules
    in the tables help and also make them feel less empty, so I recommend keeping
    them."

    is also cheaper to draw then pay a photographer or use stock. All suggestions
    made have been great.\r\n\r\nTiffany, this is a local tanning salon in Louisville,
    KY. At first I didn't want to center the logo (layout #1), but it fits best with
    the current layout. I  added handdrawn lei hawaii flowers as a halftone (thanks
    Chris) to help with the logo being centered.\r\n\r\nDan, I feel that the burgundy
    fits better than black. It looks more fresh since there would be no black anywhere
