    is probably suitable for an identity and is reasonably priced (compared to the
    Gotham Family).\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the links. I really like Proxima Nova, I think I will go with
    this one. Reasonable price too! A bit of background on the client though; they
    are Makeup & Hair Technicians. \r\nSo in the fashion / beauty / health industry.
    Specialising in Bridal makeup, Hair, Editorial, Film, Tuition, specialising in
    Airbrushing. \r\nHope this helps ;-)"

    it. \r\n\r\nTuition? When I had to pay tuition, I just wrote a check. I didn't
    need a makeup or hair technician for it!"

  body: If you're willing to venture out of the Gotham/Proxima realm, I'm a big fan
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PRC.119254.0.0">Klavika</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=strada">FF
    Strada</a>, and I think they'd work well for your client.

  body: It does seem that nearly everyone in the <cite>fashion / beauty / health industry</cite>
    is using light, classic-looking sans faces. I would definitely consider a family
    that has more character and/or distinction. The last thing you want is for your
    client to blend in.
