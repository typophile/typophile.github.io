body: "  Trying to locate the top font 'Shuckers\" and the bottom font as well.  But
  I am more concerned about the top font.\r\n  It looks SO familiar, but my searches
  thus far haven't uncovered anything.  \r\nI know I have seen it before, and it's
  probably a pretty common font.\r\n\r\nRe-doing an ad for a company that of course,
  doesn't have their logo saved or know ANYTHING about it!  \r\n\r\nthanks for any
  help or any suggested similar fonts!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2321_font_4131.jpg]"
