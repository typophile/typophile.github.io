  body: "'POMEGRANATE LIQUEUR' on the bottle looks like a modification of Friz Quadrata,
    or quite a lot like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/triplett_light/?sample_text=POMEGRANATE%20LIQUEUR&sample_size=24|Triplett]],
    which I always thought of as a Friz wanna-be.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Akira, I agree. Basilea was in the old Image Club Letterpress 6.0 collection,
    which I have, but I do not know of any versions currently available. Do you? We
    [[http://www.typophile.com/node/7504|once talked about this]] and Grant Hutchinson
    said it was no longer available.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
