		<div class="commentbody">Jenson was the man (Aldus was a poser), and most Jensons (except those with large x-heights) are wonderful, especially for book work. But: <BR>1) You want something that amplifies the topic, and a Jenson seems too Italian Renaissance here. <BR>2) What makes a font [nominally] good for a book is mostly technical, like proper vertical proportions - and a bunch of fonts have what it takes, so the one you choose should have a good reason to be used. What's Jenson's? <BR> <BR>My first choice would actually be something with blackletter overtones, but it's hard to: <BR>1) Find one subtle enough to really work. This is actually something on my back-burner (actually my battery of back-burners). <BR>2) Get publishers to accept such a choice. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the help, much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Ehrhardt certainly looks like a possibility.  <BR> <BR>I kept thinking in terms of finding a font that fits with the dramatic flavor of the book (though how to find a font that says 'historical action-packed adventure' I don't know).  <BR> <BR>To instead use a font that fits geographically and chronologically is appealing in some way. As I understand it the style of the Ehrhardt font hails from mid-17th century Netherlands, yes? That's practically a perfect fit, so a Kis of some kind would be the way to go. <BR> <BR>Is the Ehrhardt particularly superior in some way, though? As it happens, my temporary employer already owns Bitstream Kis, which, to my eye, look pretty similar to Ehrhardt anyway. (Of course, buying a couple of new fonts is no obstacle at all, just wondering.) <BR> <BR>As for titling font, I haven't considered it yet. I figured I'd choose text font first and work from there. <BR> <BR>Bjorn</div>

For one thing, Kis's stuff is certainly Dutch-looking (I mean the style that Caslon sprung from), and that's because he went to the Netherlands (from Hungary) to study under the leading Dutch master, Voskens (who only agreed to teach him because he knew Kis would be going back home at  the end). <BR> <BR>&gt; Bitstream Kis <BR> <BR>If you look at the stuff on Myfonts* you'll see that the Bitstream cut is frankly the least suitable here&hellip;  :-( <BR>It lacks the sharpness and narrowness that I think makes Ehrhard promising.

It would be my first book, I've been designing only magazines this far, so it got me wondering, how much and whether the typeface of the book must reflect the topic and by which means it is achievable. I understand that when typesetting novels, it's mostly about the time and style in which they were written, but what to do when it comes to science/math/physics etc.? Is there a reading on &quot;how to choose the right typeface for a book&quot; topic or the only way to understand it is by collecting knowledge scraps from you folks?</div>
