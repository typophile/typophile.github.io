  bit more tech-looking to match the actual name better. If I would have had the choice
  I\u2019d have done something different, but - well...\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter
  much what it\u2019s for. It\u2019s all about matching the name.\r\nSo, what do you
  think? Any major flaws, or suggestions? Actually, I really don\u2019t know if this
  any good or not. Any input welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/99octanlogosample_6704.jpg]"

    because they don't always elicit a response, but if they serve their purpose,
    they are still doing their job."

    nothing wrong, people are less likely to post...\r\nHaving said that, I like it
    - it's clean & techy (without looking cheap).\r\nIf anything, do you have any
    alternate versions for the 'a'?"

    like it in a void - just not my type of aesthetic - so without knowing the context
    I have no way to give feedback.  Context is all.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the website,
    I think your changes are good, but I do prefer the two-story a - more legible
    to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a for you to compare.\r\nI still think it looks like a blob, especially at small
    sizes on screen. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like it. Also the t\u2019s horizontal
    stroke lengths vary now to the right. That kinda disturbs the uniformity I\u2019d
    like to achieve.\r\nWhat I\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll increase the vertical stroke
    width by a tiny bit, but leave the a, although it\u2019s not perfect, as it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/99octan-Logo_2-st-a_6304.jpg]"

    you've had no feedback.\r\n\r\nYou say it doesn't matter what it's for (which
    is bizarre) and should match the name, but I for one can't figure out what the
    name means -- so no idea how it's reflecting it."

    There\u2019s Super (high octane) and Normal (less octane).\r\nIt\u2019s for an
    ad agency which has to keep this name (established) although nobody really likes
    it or can relate to it much (long story). That\u2019s why I said it doesn\u2019t
    matter and that\u2019s probably where the certain nothingness comes from."

    one as it looks more in sync with the rest of the letters. \r\nSo I think you
    should stick with that - put a _final at the end of the filename and move on :)

  body: I recant - at small size, the single-storey is good.  At a larger size, I
    still don't like it - but that's probably not relevant.  :)
