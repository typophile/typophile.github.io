body: "(Excuse the cross-post with the OpenType mailing list)\r\n\r\nWe are compiling
  a list of fonts for simple writing systems (e.g. Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, etc.) which
  make at least some use of GPOS contextual positioning. For example, you might be
  using the relatively new ability of the AFDKO to do contextual kerning, or be doing
  an equivalent sort of thing using VOLT.\r\n\r\n\"Contextual kerning\" would be kern
  triplets and the like. For example, You might kern \"V.\" one way but \"V.V\" differently
  so the period is neatly between the two V's and the two V's don't collide with each
  other.\r\n\r\nCan anyone who has made such fonts let me know, either here or by
  email? Note that I'm only interested in fonts that have shipped or will actually
  ship, that we might encounter in the field.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas,\r\n\r\nI use contextual GPOS lookups to get Greek combining marks,
    typed after capital vowels (as the Unicode (de)composition rules requre) properly
    positioned <strong>before</strong> them. I. e. a 'mark' anchor point is used to
    position the mark itself, but the base character, when combined with a mark, should
    be shifted a bit to right, so that the resulting combination looks more or less
    the same as the corresponding precomposed character.\r\n\r\nSee for example my
    [[http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html|OldStandard]] font family. Note
    that the fonts are created with FontForge, which has a very good support for contextual
    lookups."

    a non-contextual GPOS adjustment on the same glyph? Or is the contextual GPOS
    adjustment the only thing that operates on that glyph in that context?\r\n\r\n(I'm
    hoping that question makes sense!)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
