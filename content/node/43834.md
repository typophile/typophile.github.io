  those specimen PDF sheets.\r\n\r\nI've seen that many foundries include a full character
  sets in the PDF, and we all know it is possible to break out the font from that.
  On the other hand maybe it is worth the risk.\r\n\r\nI am pending between including
  all characters (for the buyers sake) to give people the possibility to see all characters
  and by that I think it is good for buying customers \u2013 OR to put up the full
  character sets on my webpage as pixelbuilt images. And by this let the PDF serve
  more as inspiration. The negative side of the later is of course that people cant
  zoom in on the characters etc and get a full picture of the whole font.\r\n\r\nHow
  do you all approach this? Thanks in advance."

    spreading the font file itself) - in fact, I think that <em>not</em> including
    the full character set in the PDF may even unintentionally promote piracy; as
    a potential costumer may pirate the font in order to get to the full-scale characters\u2026\r\n\r\nBetter
    to show people what they're paying for; and make them <em>want</em> to pay instead
    of pirate, than to try and force them into paying\u2026"

    sometimes negatively influence the shapes, I think it makes ripping the PDF impossible
    or at least a lot of work.

    lost sales, but often people who would not buy even if they had to. I have met
    people (online) who collect fonts, not to use them, but only to be able to boast
    that they have a large(r) collection. Many of these people will never use the
    fonts, just having them on their hard disk is enough for them.\r\n\r\nAnd of course
    that does not deduct from the designers income the way that pirates who sell or
    otherwise distribute to actual users do."

    understand, however no hinting is only a real problem if you have very small type
    in your specimens. Which people will zoom in on. Or they print it out.\r\n\r\nIf

    especially relevant from a business standpoint. People who have nothing better
    to do than extract fonts from PDFs probably aren\u2019t ever going to be customers.
    At best it prevents people from running programs that download every specimen
    on a foundry web site, extract the fonts, and create new-but-screwy-versions that
    get released as large collections. But people do that with flash type testers
    already.\r\n\r\n<cite>How do you mean? A password to open the file?\r\nThat would

    encryption can place different limits on a file. One can encrypt a file that can
    still be viewed and printed, but not viewed as plaintext, converted to postscript,
    printed to another PDF, or embedded in other files. Reading the Acrobat manual
    would be an excellent idea for people outputting PDF specimens."

    don't think a flattened PDF is a good idea. It is just as bad, maybe worse, that

    really worried about piracy from the PDF, subset it and leave out at least one
    or two important glyphs.\r\n\r\nObviously we at Adobe are not very worried, as
    we make and post PDFs showing every glyph in each font we sell. I have no reason
    to believe that piracy via ripping fonts out of the PDF is a significant portion
    of all piracy of our fonts. If it were 10% or more, I'd start to be concerned
    about doing things differently. But I have no reason to think it's even 1%. It's
    just so much easier to get the \"actual\" font from pirate sources.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
