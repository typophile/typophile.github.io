body: "As such a beginner in this field, I have been searching for a sans serif to
  match the Arnhem Pro for some documents works. \r\n\r\nFirstly, I considered the
  Myriad Pro, but it is overused and could not excite me any more. Then, I thought
  about the Avenir Next, which is special enough but not very perfectly matched the
  Arnhem Pro. I love the Arnhem Pro, but I can hardly get a perfect sans serif  to
  match it, so here am I. I think turn to the professionals will be a good idea.\r\n\r\nSo
  gentlemen, please give your suggestions."

  body: "I absolutely adore Fresco Sans, but there are some issues with it that you
    might want to keep in mind. Its loose spacing works great at text sizes, but when
    set large (in an editorial context) I almost always have to tighten things up,
    something that Fresco\u2019s shapes doesn\u2019t handle very well (e.g. needs
    a lot of manual kerning). For more \u201Csilent\u201D work, you could get away
    with the default spacing, but it doesn\u2019t hold up well when you want some
    punch. The small caps are almost at x-height, and pretty unusable for editorial
    work. Bits and pieces of the extended character set (particulary those necessary
    for typesetting Norwegian) also stray too far from convention for my taste. So
    much so, that I had to ask permission to make a few modifications.\r\n\r\nBut
    I love it. It is such a beauty! Nobody is perfect, I guess.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The thing is, if you can use a text face large, it's not really a text face...\r\nBut
    I agree on the smallcaps.\r\n\r\nSo, Smeijers allowed you to modify it? Cool.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
