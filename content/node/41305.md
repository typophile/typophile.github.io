  to identify both typefaces used in this beautiful signage. Thanks for the help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/italiantype_3681.jpg]

    look how all the \u201Ca\u201Ds and \u201Ci\u201Ds are different."

    has somewhat similar retro feel, although capital A is very different.'

  body: "To be honest, I think that the digital format typefaces you mentioned have
    little or nothing to do \u2013 culturally speaking, with the styles of lettering
    samples in the photo posted by pcarew.\r\nThese are of course, example of custom-made
    lettering, and they are quintessentially italian. In such cases, if someone wants
    something similar, he might consider doing a research and design the letters he
    needs by himself.\r\n\r\nI particularly think neither Metroscript nor Kinescope
    have anything to share with the style of the \"Riparazioni\" lettering line."

  body: "A side note: in terms of \"handcraftedness\" Houscka Black by Nick could
    do, as a starting point, because it's \u2013 of course \u2013 european more than
    \"american\"."
