  there a better tool for creating the keyboard layout?"

  body: On Windows, the best thing is to use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">Microsoft
    Keyboard Layout Creator</a> tool. This produces keyboard drivers that can be directly
    installed in the system. I've used it for Biblical Hebrew, and have been very
    happy with it.

      a single Unicode codepoint to the SGCAP + <key> value. What I'm trying to do
      is have a touchtype keyboard for characters with diacriticals. Do you know if
      this a bug with MSKLC or a limitation of Microsoft Keyboards?\r\n\r\nThanks,"

    you have <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele\">Ukelele</a>
    available, which was updated recently."

    now is about the Keyboard ID. For unicode it should be a negative number, but
    is there any rule to follow for the number?"

  body: As long as the ID is negative, it will work.  If the ID conflicts with another
    layout, it'll be automatically assigned a new one at runtime (i.e. I don't think
    this affects the actual file).  Keep in mind, though, that a Unicode keyboard
    layout won't be available in non-Unicode programs.  It may be helpful in certain
    situations (it depends on what characters you want) to give it an ID for the MacRoman
    encoding.  That way, the layout will be available in any program, but the Unicode
    characters just may not work. Again, this depends on just how many of the characters
    are going to require Unicode.

    seems a good choice proved to be impossible to get, or at least very very difficult.
    My PC is not connected to the internet, so I use the Mac for downloads. Microsoft
    does not allow you downloading this app unless you are running an authentic windows.
    I couldn't even download with VPC (not sure if this was due to something wrong
    on my VPC system). Is there any other way to get this app?\r\n\r\nHrant mentions
    ResEdit in another <a href =\"http://typophile.com/node/351\">post</a>. I thought
    ResEdit was for Mac OS 9 or older. Is there a PC version?\r\n\r\nIs there an app
    that will convert a Mac .keylayout file, which is an XML file, to a windows keyboard?
    This would be vey good because I wouldn't need to create the keyboard twice."

    It edits the part of a file known as the \"resource fork\" (as opposed to the
    \"data fork\"), which Windows doesn't normally use.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any
    way to convert Mac .keylayout files to Windows format. I suppose it's possible,
    but probably quite difficult."

    body: "Hi Si,\r\n\r\nDidn't see what I was looking for. However, I've found another
      apparent oddity. When I set multiple codepoints in MSKLC for a single key, sometimes
      (in Word 2003) characters with a 'dotbelowcomb' (for innstance U+004C U+0323)
      will not render properly on screen. The dotbelowcomb appears to the right of
      the 'L'.  What is interesting is that if I follow that particular composite
      character with another composite (say a U+0070 U+0313) the previous composite
      character will re-render properly. I get the same behavior in WordPad. When
      I type the characters in NeoOffice or TextEdit on MacOSX everything works OK.
      I've rechecked all the OT features and the MSKLC settings and everything looks
      OK. Other diacriticals, such as a caroncomb or commaabove don't exihibit this
      problem...just the dotbelowcomb.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI think I fixed the problems I was having by creating composite
      characters for the intermediate characters (such as U+004B U+0313) and assigning
      a Unicode codepoint (1E32). Also, I found that my combination of tools didn't
      like the Capital W space modifier character (1D42). When I changed the modfier
      for my uppercase characters to the lowercase w space modifier (02B7) that solved
      the problems with incorrect word wrap.\r\nMy goal is to have a keyboard where
      users can type Roman characters in the plain and shifted states, and type the
      specialized language characters in the Caps Lock and Caps Lock shifted states.
      I'm using MSKLC and was hoping to use the SGCaps feature to accomplish this.
      However, I've found that I can only enter a single Unicode codepoint in the
      SGCaps field. In my case, I want to type in the character, diacriticals and
      space modifiers so that a single keypress will enter all the characters and
      let OpenType composite them. When I do this in the normal and shifted states
      it works fine...but I lose the ability to type Roman characters.\r\nI sent an
      message to the MSKLC group listed above...but it appears that responses are
      only generated periodically.\r\nAny ideas on how I can do this in Windows?  I've
      done this same thing with Ukelele on Mac OSX and it works great. Instead of
      switching keyboards continually the users can just set the Caps Lock key.\r\nOn
      Windows I also tried Keyboard Layout Manager...but it doesn't appear to support
      mulitple codepoints in any state and relies upon dead keys.\r\nThanks for any
      suggestions...this forum has been great for helping me get started!\r\n"

  body: Fred, have you tested this dotbelowcomb behaviour in Notepad? If something
    works correctly in Notepad, but consistently incorrectly in Wordpad or Word, that
    usually indicates a problem in the RichEdit engine.
