  body: "That one is pretty close. The S has a different \"middle part\" but it might
    be close enough for my uses.\r\n\r\nI was able to find the full logo with reverse
    image search, there are a couple more characters with \"Beaumont\" in the upper
    left that might help narrow it down.\r\n\r\nhttp://cdn.goalline.ca/banners/2774.png?1422408679"
