In the Forum the first section that I click on, if I've scrolled down the page jumps up to the top immediatley when I click, missing the section I try to click on and I end up somewhere else. So I have to go back and click on the right one. This also happens the first time I try to click on a topic. It only happens once per section/thread. Very annoying.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm getting similar weirdness to the top image that David Hamuel posted above. It seems related to when I've docked a window and then reopened it. But not always. 

I'm also now getting threads that open and the first screen-full doesn't show the posts, just the icons. If I scroll down (if it's a long enough thread), then subsequent screens show posts. And usually if I scroll back up, I can recover the first several posts. But not always.

I'm browsing with Safari 1.3.2 on OSX 10.3.9

Also, not a bug, per se, but I don't know if you intended this: At the top of the screen, I am regularly getting about 115 pixels of dead space. 

Hmm, okay, wait . . . It looks like now that I've logged in to post a comment, that seems to have gone away. Okay, so now it is a bug.

So far so good. 

One other small thing that you might not be aware of. Safari is consistently reporting "one error opening the page" and says it can't find the host for "http://misc/id_generic.gif". Maybe this is a local placeholder file, but it must still be in the code somewhere.

Thought you might like to know.

the aliases for wiki entries all seem to have been wiped out since the changeover, and linking using article names seems to be broken. i hope this makes sense and that i have my facts straight, but i'm assuming you would know better than i about the functionality pre and post changeover.</div>

Once upon a time we had a membership system which allowed people to make payments to Typophile and in return receive typographic treats and site benefits. We are hoping to implement a similar system in the coming weeks. It certainly won't be mandatory, but we would like to be able to offer everyone the option to support us and help in our effort to maintain the site.

There are also ways the community can support us through advertising, in banner form and as a Featured Face sponsor. Please email me directly for more information regarding these kinds of opportunities. evens@punchcut.com

Keep your eyes peeled for more information in these regards…</div>

<em>What pathetic whining. How much do you pay for access to Typophile?</em>

What's that got to do with anything?

<em>The new version of Topple is very advanced technically and took mountains of programming time.</em>

What's that got to do with anything?

<strong><em>The issue is results and performance, not intention or effort.</strong></em>

Why is every redesign NOT an improvement? This reminds me of what used to be called "The Big Three" automakers. Whining about "legacy costs" while still producing cars that are ugly, not as fuel efficient or as reliable, and don't handle as well as the competition. I'm sure it takes as much work to execute a poor design as well as a good one. Maybe the "technically advanced programmers" are in the wrong business. I guess in the end it's about having vision. Or not.

When I couldn't buy a font at multiple locations, I was lambasted for having IE 5.5. Now it's Mike Yanega's turn to get dumped on because he's using OS9. Obviously it's too hard for the "technically advanced programmers" to make things backwards compatible. Even Blu-Ray and HD DVD players are backwards compatible. Well, I have my own opinion as to what (or who) is backwards. I think it is irresponsible to do beta testing and bug fixing on a running forum. Microsoft should not be a role model.

<strong>BUG:</strong> If I enlarge the font in my new Firefox browser (in the forum index) it can overrun the right-hand column ("Support our sponsors") and it looks just like my old IE 5.5. Was this done to ease my transition to Firefox? This does NOT happen within threads themselves. See image at http://typophile.com/node/34646#comment-210703

@Renaissance Man: Without getting in a flamewar; backwards compatible á la, but supporting hardware/software that is 10 years old or older, that is another story, and just impossible. You can't make something like a website backwards compatible if the software that is supposed to render it does not support certain features that it uses, like flash or even things as CSS and such. That would make no sense at all. :)
But I agree that beta-testing on the running forum is a bit backwards as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Q: No flamewar. While browser compatibility should be a quandary for developers/programmers, their general attitude is I don't give a crap, I really don't care if luddites don't have access, devil take the hindmost.

Look, we no longer have 8" or 5 1/4" floppies (and 3 1/2" floppies are almost extinct) and I can deal with that. But there ARE a lack of Web standards, and the attitude of "If you don't have IE 5.5+ or Safari or Firefox or whatever, I wont let you into my domain" really sucks. There is something seriously wrong when the US Customs REQUIRES IE 5.5 or above and the USPS won't function properly with IE 5.5. This is CRAZY! And some banks will not let you do online banking without some version of IE! See http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2007/6/15/85112/3392 

All those who propagate the "It's my way or the highway" mentality are really the problem, whether it's the US Government or Typophile.

Flash absolutely works with IE 5.5 SP2. Typophile.com does not.

If DVD player manufacturers can be backwards compatible, so can web designers. I realize there is some limit, but may the most business go to the most compatible websites. It's too bad that Typophile is rather unique, and, therefore, as a monopoly, can afford to say to the minority, "Screw you!"

The attitude must come with the big bucks they are being paid for doing this.

In case the facetiousness wasn't obvious, I think they are doing a great job with what is essentially a free service. Then again, most of it works fine with my 5 year old Win XP computer. 

In computers, if you are older than that, you really can't blame anyone for not being compatible (imo).

		<div class="commentbody">Backwards compatible ok, but there is a limit to <em>how far</em> back. Fact is that some technologies are just not supported by older software, because it has changed significantly or just didn't exist yet. That would mean a website shouldn't use that technology, because a minority would not be able to render it. That would be rediculous, in my opinion. I mean, MacOS9 is 8 years old, IE 5.5 is 7 years old. If you want to have technological progress, a loss in backwards compatability is the consequence.
Obviously most websites are somewhat backwards compatible, but eventually rendering errors will show up, that is just inevitable. Then again, if you can run a newer version of certain software, then why wouldn't you. :)

I find the comparison to DVD-players a bit far fetched, because it has little to do with webdesign and its programming languages.</div>

Related to more than anything my surfing style, I really enjoy being able to pop open a window without loosing the page I'm on and by instinct I simply hold down the option key whenever I click a link . . .

Unfortunately, this doesn't work on the Typophile dynamic Flash home page and so I thought I'd put in my request to have it added if it's all the same . . .

Thanks for the great work on the update, it's a fantastic improvement . . .

Ranting Papazian, what ever happened to "if it ain't broke, don't fix it?" What's with bells and whistles, when this site is so s-l-o-w  -- when it's running? And why is it running less often than any other web site I visit? It's like dazzle them with BS when you can't deliver the goods.

Zara --It's oh-so-easy (and smug) to dismiss "personal frustrations with the state of technology" when you aren't affected by it. What a cheap shot: if people aren't up to your level of "technology," the hell with them?

And of course no one says anything about the bugs I reported.

		<div class="commentbody">Most of this site actually works pretty well with older browsers -- or at least it should. Just turn off CSS and you should get a decent, bare-bones version that'll work just fine. As long as you use well-formatted HTML (xHTML, whatever) the site should look fine in Netscape 1.0.

The only problem I see with this is the Flash nav at the top. Maybe there should be some text links somewhere on each page. Or use SWFObject to provide alternate content when Flash isn't available... just a suggestion.

I'm on Mac OS 10.4.9 and all is well on Firefox and Camino so far.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Let me be clear about this: Typophile.com is a singular resource made possible by the hard work and dedication of unpaid lovers of type. It is a resource I cherish. Were this not so, I wouldn't care about the slowness or downtime of the site or the "advanced technology" that serves the majority and makes it difficult for a minority.

The love of type and the dedication of those that run it (and the defensiveness thereof) does not excuse the site's flaws or the premature rollout of buggy software. We can be brutal in criticizing a font, and be little short of obsessive-compulsive about kerning, letter spacing, and word spacing, and not apply that same perfectionist passion to the site that we love and cherish. Why is that?</div>

<strong>Suggestion</strong> I'd like to be able to tag a topic for tracking/returning to later without posting a comment to it. Is this do-able? I usually stumble across some great discussions well after it's been closed, or it so far along I don't really have much to contribute to, but would like to go back to and reread or see what's been added to it.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the redesign - but I'm here on a T1 at work and it is considerably slower than before - both when you load the site and click on a thread. It's also much slower at home on DSL.

It seems like the icons for the threads take the longest to load - but I'm no web designer and it could be that they are just the last to load.

The main entrance page does not seem to load unless it's in an active tab - and then it takes a while.

OSX 10.4.9 & Safari 2.0.4

I like the new icon bit at the bottom, but I don't show up unless I post something.

Many thanks for the herculean effort and I'm sure that eventually this will be tweaked to perfection.</div>

I've had this problem too. I went into a font ID and added a link - and then went back in and added some text and now I'm out of ID contention... we IDers count on slipping the ID in fast, this could screw up the horse race.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The strong message I am getting in this thread and in the 'moritorium on editing posts' thread is that   good functionality is more important to Typophile users than additional functionality. 

IMHO the most important things for Typophile users are: 1. To post and read quickly. 2. To navigate easily and quickly. 3. To post images and PDFs quickly and easily--and throughout a thread. 

I would humbly suggest that getting this basic functionality working well should be a higher priority than adding new functionality. </div>

I tried logging out, hoping to speed things up, and things didn't load faster for this old Win XP computer.

The speed thing will be taken care of when a new host is in place. Might as well be patient until then. Patience is supposed to be a virtue, or something like that, so look at this as an opportunity to grow.
