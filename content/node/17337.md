  body: "OK, I can see U is modified. But Ps are different too... Are Ps also modified?
    Isn't there an Adobe Garamond look-alike font with P closed somewhere (maybe more
    common with PC world, not Mac environment)? I come across the same dilanma all
    the time, and I always modify Ps on Adobe Garamond. Am I wrong? Or am I looking
    at wrong Adobe Garamond, if there is such a thing?\r\n\r\nThank you!!"
