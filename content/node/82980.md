  magazine House & Garden? It really does look like Big Caslon but in a bold or black
  version, that I haven't been able to find.\r\n\r\n(The sans is Gotham in case (probably
  not) someone was wondering)\r\n\r\nBest Peter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/houseandgarden_4941.jpg]"

  body: The more I look at it, the more I'm sure that it is indeed a bolder version
    of Big Caslon. Does anyone know where it's from?

  body: "There are a couple extra weights of Big Caslon (plus italics) that have been
    developed custom for various publications. Your image looks like the Black weight.\r\n\r\nThe
    updated, expanded series is scheduled for Retail release from FB later this year.
