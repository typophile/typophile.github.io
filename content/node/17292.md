    and a 1999 revised second edition right now. The second edition is a hundred pages
    longer, so I'd say it's obvious there are significant differences (or at least
    additions) between those two.\r\n\r\nThe revised second edition has about 40 pages
    that have corrections or additions compared to the regular second edition.\r\n\r\nI
    think that the current version is actually \"edition 2.5\" as of 2002 or so, and
    has moderate noticeable changes compared to the second edition, mostly in areas
    that have to do with things that have changed due to technical advances (e.g.
    OpenType). However, my most recent copy is at work, so I can't check easily.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    the following note:\r\n\r\nThis version of the third edition incorporates emendations
    to pages 91, 119, 182, 246, 288, 295, 303, 306, 311, 317, 318, 361-364, 373 and
    381. (if thats any help to you). i just flipped through a few of the \"changed\"
    pages, and there's not much that i'd say really changed in the last years. most
    of the changes seem to be about the different accents."

      of the 3.0 edition in another store \u2014 very perplexing!</em>\r\n\r\nWell,
      if it makes you feel any better, I just read through the first 65 pages of my
      v3.1 today. For the entire first chapter, only every other set of pages (one
      side of each piece of paper) is printed. Oddly enough, you'd expect the same
      near the end of the book, but it doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nOh, the
      irony in having a defectively-printed version of a book about typography. I'm
      not returning it, either. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Is this a new trend, and is it really
      necessary?</em>\r\n\r\nConsidering that Bringhurst cites Strunk and White as
      his inspiration for <em>ETS</em>, maybe he's just trying to keep up with S&W's
      publishers. I've still got my old copy of the Elements of Style. I personally
      find the illustrated edition to be rather <em>un</em>necessary."

    because the book is comprised of a series of 32-page <em>signatures</em>. Look
    at the top or bottom of the book, near the spine, and you will see the signatures
    and how they fold. Or, open up the book at pages 16-17 (or 48-49) and look at
    the spread's gutter: you will see the sewing that keeps those 32 pages together.
    (I have a copy of version 2.4 here, and it is made up of 11 signatures.)"
