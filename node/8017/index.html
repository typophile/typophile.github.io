<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Lesson One <br> <br>A famous calligrapher was sitting on a tree <br>resting, doing nothing. A small type designer <br>saw the man of letters and asked him, "Can I <br>also sit like you and do nothing ?" <br>The calligrapher answered : "Sure, why not ?" <br>So, the type designer sat on the ground below <br>the calligrapher and rested. All of a sudden, <br>a foundry appeared, hired the type designer <br>and took advantage on him. <br> <br>Management Lesson : <br> <br>To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be <br>sitting very, very high up. <br> <br> <br> <br>Lesson Two <br> <br>A sad type designer saw a bull and started to <br>tell him his thoughts. "Oh, bull, I would love <br>to be able to get to the top of the font design <br>tree," sighed the sad type designer, "but I have <br>not got the energy." Suddenly the bull voiced : <br> <br>"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my <br>droppings ?" replied the bull. "They're packed <br>with nutrients." <br> <br>The sad type designer pecked at a lump of dung, <br>and found it actually gave him enough strength <br>to reach the lowest branch of the font tree. <br>The next day, after eating some more dung, he <br>reached the second branch facing a slab typeface. <br>Finally after a fourth night spent in front of <br>FontLab, the type designer was proudly perched <br>at the top of the font tree with an OpenType in <br>his hands. <br>He was promptly spotted by a craftsman, who shot <br>him out of the tree. <br> <br>Management Lesson : <br> <br>Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't <br>keep you there. <br> <br> <br> <br>Lesson Three <br> <br>A little Finnish type designer girl was flying <br>south for the winter. Getting to the airport, <br>it was so cold that the girl froze and fell to <br>the ground into a large field in the middle of <br>a forest. While she was lying there, a reindeer <br>came by and dropped some dung on her. <br>As the frozen girl lay there in the pile of dung, <br>she began to realize how warm she was. The dung <br>was actually thawing her out! She lay there all <br>warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy, <br>"the ABCs of love..." (<a href=http://tinyurl.com/4f84f target=_blank>http://tinyurl.com/4f84f</a>). <br>A passing Art Director man heard the girl singing <br>and came to investigate. <br>Following the sound, the AD discovered the girl <br>under the pile of reindeer dung, and promptly dug <br>her out and took advantage on her. <br> <br>Management Lesson : <br> <br>1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. <br>2. Not everyone who gets you out of &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; is your <br> friend. <br>3. And when you are in deep &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;, it is best to <br> keep your mouth shut !</div>
