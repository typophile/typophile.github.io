body: "I wanted to experiment with making a typeface in a casual, unsophisticated
  way, as an educational experience. I'd like to try and get technical like you good
  folks at some point, and make some really crisp & clean fonts, but I know there's
  a big learning curve waiting for me. So this was just a quick & dirty project.\r\n\r\nI
  love the font used in the movie poster for Hanna, and saw that there wasn't a full
  typeface out there yet, so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is just a screengrab
  out of Illustrator, with some alternate characters below. I love the tension between
  the vertical lines in every character (so, a total of 3 distinct characters...)
  in the movie poster, so I was disappointed when I couldn't give every character
  those vertical lines. It just started to look like a B.C./caveman font... So I looked
  at some fonts with similar \"A\"s and decided to go with some rounded characters.\r\n\r\n<img

  I have no idea where this falls in the grey area between rip-off and paying homage,
  but this project was just for fun, I have no desire to profit on anyone else's work,
  so if anyone's concerned about that, feel free to advise me, I don't even have plans
  to release this font on a free site unless someone really wants it for some reason.</em>\r\n\r\nNot
  sure if it's good enough or if there's glaring changes I should make, besides cleaning
  up & tightening the respective sizes and margins and such...\r\n\r\nAny critiques
  or advice for me with this little project?\r\n\r\n"
