  using Fontlab. I need to add in some unique characters, but I'm not sure how to
  do it! The client wants to be able to write Mr normally, Mr with a small r, and
  Mr with a small r and \" underneath the r! At first I thought ligatures but I'm
  not sure that they would then be able to write Mr normally or with Superscript?\r\n\r\nAlso
  Fontlab doesn't seem to have a pound sign!?\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help that would
  be great and if anyone wants to take the job off of me that would be awesome!\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot!!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unique_characters_4397.jpg]"

    Fontlab\u2019s font window there are a few buttons to click on and just left to
    that is a popup menu to choose options from. I suggest you making yourself a little
    familiar with these."

  body: "Natalie, \r\n\r\nif it's for Microsoft Word, you could use stylistic sets
    features (ss01, ss02) to turn on the different ligatures. You could go with something
    like that (provided that M_r.ss01 is the one variant and M_r.ss02 is the other):
    \r\n\r\n<code>feature ss01 { \r\n  sub M r by M_r.ss01; \r\n} ss01;\r\nfeature
    ss02 { \r\n  sub M r by M_r.ss02; \r\n} ss02;\r\nfeature dlig { \r\n  sub M r
    from M_r.ss01; \r\n} dlig;\r\nfeature salt { \r\n  sub M r from M_r.ss02; \r\n}
    salt;</code>\r\n\r\nPreferably, you might want to use some contextual substitutions
    so you don't have situations where \"Stanley\" would be written with a superscript
    \"t\". So perhaps: \r\n\r\n<code>feature ss01 { \r\n  sub M' r' [space period]
    by M_r.ss01; \r\n} ss01;\r\nfeature ss02 { \r\n  sub M' r' [space period] by M_r.ss02;
    \r\n} ss02;\r\nfeature dlig { \r\n  sub M' r' [space period] from M_r.ss01; \r\n}
    dlig;\r\nfeature salt { \r\n  sub M' r' [space period] from M_r.ss02; \r\n} salt;</code>\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"
