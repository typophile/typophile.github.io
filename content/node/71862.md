body: "I've been trying to figure out what this font is for a while.  It's on a promotional
  piece my company has, but the piece was made before I started, and of course, there's
  no layered file and the old computer (that had the fonts on it) was replaced before
  I started here, too.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!"
