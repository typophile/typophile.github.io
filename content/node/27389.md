body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni was browsing the linotype font library and found an explanation
  about XSF fonts,\r\nfirst of all do anyone of you have any experience with these
  type of fonts?\r\n\r\nwhat i could make out that it's only intended for Windows,
  what i really want to \r\nknow if these fonts can be used for example say web sites
  or are they just especially made for a windows environment (and do you have to manually
  select the XSF font if you work with small type).\r\n\r\nany info is appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    fonts that Linotype distributes. They are primarially intended for use in corporate
    office environments, where so much reading is being done on screen now (Microsoft
    Word, e-mail, etc.).\r\n\r\nHope that helps!"

    with ClearType?"

    screen for Macs and PCs. It's like the next monopoly race in computer technology.\r\n\r\nAMD
    just aquired ATI. Can we expect Intel to aquire nVidia as a response?"
