body: "I was curius what helvetica would look like with some ligatures, and couldn\u2019t
  find any examples, so I decided to make my own. I made two versions, one is more
  linear based on the forms of the t and the second is more curvy based on the top
  of the s. I understand that this is purely ornamental, but I wanted to do some experimenting.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/01/deservedly-rare/\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone else seen any good examples of helvetica ligatures."

  body: I think the first version is very interesting but the second one is keeping
    with the typeface better. Cool stuff.

  body: "Usually, ligatures had not worked well with sans faces, but yours is a cool
    try, even when it's heretic.\r\nI agree with Nachos on preserving font consistence.\r\nAnyway,
    I find some quirk effect in the encounters.\r\nProbably they needs to be softened.\r\nLet
    me show you some quick experiments I did on it, though some are very obvious and
    not well spaced (counterforms are unbalanced):\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/st_3690.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fi_3563.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fl_6233.jpg]\r\n\r\nMarS"

    arrows show curve problems.\r\nLeft one: acute joins like this need to be thinned.\r\nRight
    one: too thick on the inside.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Agreed..it would probably have to be optically corrected. Any other possible
    combinations?
