  body: Verdana was designed for screen usage, was it not? (Granted, that charlie
    rose one is a bit of an abomination...then again, charlie was never one to spend
    money on his set design either)

  body: What has really been bothering me lately is the complete overuse of Bank Gothic
    by CBS news.  Food Network seems to be using much less of it lately, which is
    nice.

  body: I think 'Lost' uses it as well for its end-of-episode screen, along with a
    geometric sans for the opening (Futura, I think) and what looks to me like Impact
    for the ads.

  body: "That's always bugged me, that Lost doesn't use Futura for the \"boom\" tag
    at the end. It's as if it was a last minute addition and they didn't have the
    correct font handy. Now they're stuck with it and would get complaints from fans
    if they changed it (presumably). The title graphics are otherwise pretty good,
    so it's like seeing someone in a nicely tailored suit with flip-flops.\r\n\r\nMy
    theory is that all these shows are edited on Macs* in Final Cut Pro and the producers
    don't bother to put the branding fonts on the machines. So you end up seeing a
    lot of system fonts used. It still can't believe the end credits for the Sopranos
    are set in Geneva. All six seasons.\r\n\r\n* I say \"Macs\" because I see so many
    Mac-only system fonts used. I'm sure there are studios that use Windows for editing
    tv shows, too. "

  body: I bet you're right, Mark. Though, font annoyance aside, it's nice to know
    which 'boom' is the last one. Particularly given that the shows endings are often
    as unresolved as the commercial breaks.

    television. And I cringe every time I see the logo. He has even had shows on design,
    but obviously, like so many people who are otherwise culturally knowledgeable
    and sophisticated, when it comes to  graphic design and typography, he doesn''t
    get it. '

  body: The PZN logo looks particularly atrocious with all the special effects CNN
    has dancing around it. But I think they actually canceled the show sometime recently.

    Australia, but America gets more watchable TV shows than we do down here. This

    there are a few TV show logos done with Arial and TNR? Helvetica is commonplace
    so Arial isn't out of contention. I can think of at least one animated children's
    TV show that uses Comic Sans (or a similar font) but the name escapes me right
    now.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I have seen a few of Charlie Rose's shows, and it really is reassuring as
    you say William, to see how the other half lives in the U.S. That there is another
    half. I was kidding in my opening line back there.\r\n\r\nI'm circumspect of television
    in general because I've worked on TV adverts, and the standard of programming
    down here is pretty lame. For example, I can't see <em>SNL</em> unless I pay for
    cable TV, which is still withering value for money here. I've seen plenty of intelligence
    on shows like <em>MAD TV</em> but it's only screened on free-to-air TV at 3am.\r\n\r\nj

  body: I haven't watched much TV at all on the TV itself for about a year. I watch
    particular shows online, though. For example, you can watch any interview you
    want at charlierose.com/search , and watch full episodes of Lost at abc.com/player
    . But the ABC player restricts video to US IP addresses.

    the show, so it should be big enough to go with a display font anyway.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/300px-Pixel_geometry_01_Pengo&#91;1&#93;_4001.jpg]"
