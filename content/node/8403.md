body: I found this typeface in a collateral designed for AIGA 50 Book Covers Exhibition.
  Can anybody tell what it is? Looks kinda like TheSerif, but that&#39;s not it. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56890.jpg" alt="AIGA">

  body: Good call, Chris! Just like Apex Sans, the lighter weights of the <BR>Serif
    work much better than the heavy weights.
