  body: "Great thanks for those! I'm sure I'll find something there as some of those
    fonts are gorgeous.\r\n\r\nAnd don't worry, I have my keyboard on my lap when
    writing this as my head is hung so low with shame with misspelling Bodoni! That'll
    teach me not to check what I've written! ;-)"
