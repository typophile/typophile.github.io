		<div class="commentbody">Interesting article, but why do you belief Fleischman has done every cut by his own? :-) Mostly 2 or 3 masters for different sizes were produced. From these the other sizes would be derived in a special machine - the Pantograph. <BR> <BR>Before this time, every broken &hellip;(I don`t know the english word - in german its called &quot;Stahlstempel&quot;) to build the &quot;forms&quot; for the lead types have to be reproduced. - This means, the master design has to be rewritten! This happens a lot and so the font face changed or shifted over the years. Maybe to avoid to much such broken &quot;Stahlstempels&quot;, the old faces were cut with less detail or even other details.- I mean, it is possible that such differences came form a different type production and reproduction technology, and / or form a shifting in the cuts. Perhaps someone knows when this pantograph technology was introduced by the foundry of Enschede.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The pantograph matrix engraving machine is a late ninetheenth-century development and was not used extensively in foundries until the early part of the twentieth. ATF, for instance, began using it in only at the tail end of the first decade, if then. <BR> <BR>I've been reading <em>Typefoundries in the Netherlands From the Fifteenth to the Nineteenth Century</em> by Charles Enschede (trans by Harry Carter and based on the 1893 edition). There is some discussion of Fleischman and the work. I doubt that there would have been two or three master designs, or, for that matter, any definitive master (other than ongoing carbon proofs). The size optimization was normally the result of the hand and eye correction during the process of cutting the punch. More of an intuitive organic process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>I have read your piece several times now and I still don't quite understand what it is supposed to convey. There are so many variables in letterpress printing that given any five examples, you will end up with five different renderings. Ink coverage and ink accumulation, pressure and movement of the ink rollers, impression and makeready, previous wear on type, substrate variables (surface and thickness - and, in handmades, variation within the sheet itself!), dampness of paper, weather conditions, etc, all contribute to variation, even within an edition run. Add to this the kind of press, the particular operational variables of the press, and the rational of the work (fine press, commercial, get-it-out-this-afternoon, etc). And this is all yet ignoring the experience, approach, and attitude of the pressman. <BR> <BR>I don't see how this can convey useful information on type design. Certainly some historical printers may have been concerned with rendering the type design exactingly, but rarely in the commercial sphere.  <BR> <BR>Fournier's famous remark, &quot;it is not right to blame the letter for the fault of the ink,&quot; is probably indicative. Once the type was cast and ink applied, it's completely out of the punchcutter's hands.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fleischman was way before the pantograph - as far as I know all those fonts are one font: from the same matrices. Also, I think in each case wear would be nil or minimal. <BR> <BR>&gt; so many variables <BR> <BR>Yes, but it's still possible to ask some smart questions - because those samples were very type-conscious, and things like paper were chosen very carefully. Considering that in each case the printer was certainly very concerned about <i>exactly</i> how the type came out, I could validly ask for example: why is the 1908 the only one to preseve the <i>true</i> letter shapes? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
