body: I was just wondering if anyone knew of a method or plugin or such that would
  allow me to take my MAC inDesign CS files and open them on my PC version of inDesign
  CS.  I would think there would be a way, but I haven&#39;t been able to find one.  Any
  info would be great!  Thanks!

  body: Windows version expects InDesign files to have a &#34;.indd&#34; suffix. If
    this is missing, the OS won&#39;t know what app to launch when you double-click
    the file, and the file may not show up by default in a &#34;file open&#34; dialog.
    But you can still open the file, either by doing &#34;show all files&#34; in the
    file open dialog, or even just drag and drop the file into the PC version&#39;s
    window. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thanks, but this doesn&#39;t seem to work.  I have saved the files on the
    MAC and transferred them to the PC.  They have the .indd extension and indesign
    lists them on the &#34;OPEN FILE&#34; dialog box.  However when I click on any
    to open it gives me an error message: &#34;Cannot open the file &#60;name&#62;.indd.  Adobe
    Indesign may not support the file format, a plug-in that that supports the format
    may be missing, or the file may be open in another application&#34;    <BR> <BR>To
    me this makes no sense because obviously Adobe .indd files are supported.  So
    is there another difference in the MAC and PC formats?? <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

  body: Hmm. Perhaps it&#39;s a plug-in issue. Are you using a plug-in on the Mac
    side that you might not have on the Windows side? For example, do you have an
    auto-activation plug-in for a font manager that adds extra data to the InDesign
    file? <BR> <BR>Failing that, you might want to post in the Adobe User-to-User
    forums. Just go to http://www.adobeforums.com and pick one of the two InDesign
    forums. Maybe the Windows one. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
