  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I watched “Helvetica: the Film” again last night (I own the DVD). It got me thinking about my choice of type and which faces I use, again and again. Well, here they are.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/faces_5358.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have been through years of trying new creations, the latest ideas and fashions, and I keep going back to these. Why? They are elegant, they are drawn well, they have a timeless quality, the kerning math is well done and their forms submit to all kinds of manipulations. I admire the conviction and work of Massimo Vignelli, but unlike him I am not attached to these because I have a manifesto based in modernity or even post-modernity. I am not attached to them because of the historical or aesthetic associations that come with them, but rather because in and of themselves I think they are beautiful. They each possess a distinctive quality, but they work well together, alone or as pieces of a design. I guess I am more of an essentialist than a historicist.</p>
<p>Conversely, I don’t neglect typefaces because they connote bad associations (ala Paula Scher), but rather because I find most other faces clunky, programmed all wrong, comical, immature and too self-absorbed. Idiosyncratic is the word. The list of these is long. For instance, I love the design of Scala, but it does not work everywhere, it is incredibly specialized and only fits with very particular applications. Another is Bau. It looks nice at the lighter weights (because it emulates Helvetica/ Berthold Akzidenz?), but the heavier weights become comical and kind of ridiculous, shooting off angular tangents that mix up a layout. Maybe their DNA is just not in my blood.</p>
<p>For me, after ten years of wringing my hands over the next FontFont catalog, 8 is enough. When I need something ultra-unique, I draw it myself, and it stays with the project for which it was created as a one-off design. This approach works for me.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Chris</p>
