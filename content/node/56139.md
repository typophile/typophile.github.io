    they do?\r\n\r\nBlind suggestions; <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/neutraface\">Neutraface.</a>
    What else? Well Futura or anything by Peter Behrens (er, because he was an architect).
    But I see you're in Shanghai, so there may be something else that is more appropriate
    to the specifics of the job."
