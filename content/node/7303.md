  crit. Almost needed color coding to follow all the conversation threads! More of
  these live crits are in order. <BR> <BR>One question in the chat that I wished I&#39;d
  been involved with was &#34;when to approach a distributor with you design?&#34;
  Generally it seemed the response was: when you have something fairly &#34;together&#34;
  people will work with you to noodle and polish. <BR> <BR>I was recently in Ed Benguit'

  body: Once upon a time, oh, about anytime before 1986, ITC was the only decision
    you would have as a type designer. <BR> <BR>How quickly that has been forgotten.
    ITC was as hated as MS is today. Fortunately, they got caught with their pants
    down when DTP whizzed through. <BR> <BR>And fortunately, they recovered, and got
    humble.

  body: ITC is just a subdivision of Agfa Monotype. And who want to be included in
    the Agfa Monotype collection? hey, huh. <BR> <BR>ITC lost their marketing power
    when Batty left them, as Monotype lost similar things decades ago, when Dreyfus
    left too. <BR> <BR>And Agfa have nothing to lost... so don&#39;t lost you with
    them.

  body: How did you decide on ITC? <BR> <BR>Given Ed&#39;s history at ITC and the
    fact that the work was designed on his watch, it was a natural to submit there.
    Admittedly ITC is not the first place I dash off to in search of the latest and
    greatest. But also admittedly, up until recently I thought and ascender was and
    elevator. <BR> <BR>JFP, perhaps I should have sent it off to you :-&#41; <BR><a

  body: 'When I worked at HTF, we would receive submissions from designers who have
    already blown out their typeface into sixteen weights, complete with italics.
    And we would look at these and see &#40;I should say, Jonathan would see&#41;
    some basic letterform design issues in the core weight. At that late stage, to
    suggest a revision would demand design changes to several dozen fonts, and the
    work that would entail would seem prohibitive. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m with Ed Benguiat

  body: The first time I submited &#40;as described&#41; a typeface it was longtime
    ago, probably Angie, my first one to FF. In fact, I just send the a basic character
    set &#40;suh panels done for Morisawa, it was in 1990&#41;. But this was before
    I start to design with computers. They don&#39;t have done any comments, I just
    decided how many weights, etc. <BR> <BR>Then, i submited Anisette to FB circa
    1995/96, there, they asked for hamburgefonstiv and some others trials if you have,
    such weights, etc. <BR> <BR>Then, they reviewed it and ask for corrections, etc.
    <BR> <BR>Now, its my own boss who decide if he accept my designs, generally he
    is quite cool with me and we have same feelings on letterforms. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'This is truly a powerful thread. I&#39;m like Randy, very new to the game.
    It would be nice to see this info compiled into a handy PDF document for people
    like us to use as research. <BR> <BR>I believe the best answer I&#39;ve recieved
    so far from anyone is this. Don&#39;t sell your first fonts, hand them out for
    free. By doing this you will get a lot more people downloading your font. By doing
    this you will find out if your font is truly perfect. Are all the contours closed?
    Are there kerning pairs that you didn&#39;t account for? Guaranteed that someone
    in the world will find something wrong. You also can get a name for yourself and
    start to generate a little traffic through your web site. Develop a fan base of
    sorts. <BR> <BR>Anyways, that&#39;s my two cents. I&#39;d like to think that some
    of my early fonts could start generating cash, but I have a long road ahead of
    me &#40;much like any starting typographer&#41;. If you look at type web sites
    almost everyone has a free font for download. Chank told me this once: All my
    free fonts are either very old fonts, or fonts I don&#39;t wish to continue on
    creating glyphs. I think that&#39;s a good piece of advice. Get as many of these
    buggers under your arms. Once you decide your path then take the good ones from
    the bad ones. <BR> <BR>Did I go too far off the original subject? <BR> <BR>t1m'

  body: Tim, I would have to, by instinct, disagree with you on a couple of things.  <BR>
    <BR>First, I would not want to use my market to test my designs. They should &#40;
    my designs &#41; be perfected before they are released. It would seem an unfortunate
    situation that the first impression of your foundry or type face would be riddled
    with issues. I would give your market more credit. The name you get for yourself
    might not be good with incomplete efforts. <BR> <BR>Second,  &#34;Get as many
    of these buggers under your arms.&#34;.  I would rather have one design of top
    quality than ten of half of the first. In other words, quality not quantity. I
    believe Bringhurst could be referenced for a much more eloquent version of this
    statement. As a painter, I totally agree with Picasso

    <BR> <BR>I hope I am not out of line here. But as Tim said, this <i>is</i> a powerful
    thread. My hopes are, despite it&#39;s irony, that it will get even more attention
    there. Also, I really want to see that &#34;Build&#34; area built. It is a really
    great area of   discussion that seems to me under used. It could become yet another
    shining light in the legend of Typophile.  <BR> <BR>But I digress yet again...

  body: '&#62; interpolation <BR> <BR>Since the computer can&#39;t guess what you
    want, it needs <i>two</i> fonts &#40;like a Light and a Bold&#41; to create more
    weights automatically&#42;. Fog can do interpolation, but it seems FontLab&#39;s
    is better, not least because you can <i>extrapolate</i> too, and can often interpolate
    adequately between totally different fonts! <BR> <BR>&#42; You can also create
    lighter/darker weights from a single font, but that&#39;s not interpolation, and
    it generally requires a lot of clean-up, as well as adjustments &#40;like making
    the thins thinner/thicker&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
