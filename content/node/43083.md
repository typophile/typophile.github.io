body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nWorking on a new id marque for a client. The concept has been approved
  \u2013 so I'm just refining it now and would be good to get some advice from the
  masters among you!\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the original plain typeface, the letters
  'a' and 'h' don't sit together that well:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_original_small_5315.png]\r\n\r\nSo
  what I've tried to do is combine the 'a' and 'h' with a ligature to make a more
  unified and unique marque, and allow the kerning to be much tighter. I'll be using
  this at quite large sizes so I've also reduced the ellipses and the spacing in general:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_small_6528.png]\r\n\r\nI
  think the ligature is working \u2013 but I'm not 100% happy with it. It seems a
  shame to lose the character you get from that little flick on the 'a'. So it would
  be good to get your thoughts about if this is the best way I could join them, or
  any other ways you think this could be improved?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nEd\r\n"

  body: You might want to mirror the top curve of the "a," with its nice smooth contrast,
    in your link between the a and h.

  body: You could also reduce the size of the lower left serifs on both legs of the
    h ( a popular modeling style for serifs now anyway) to make the a & h fit together.
    I think your lig is okay too - it could be opened up slightly - but the ellipses
    need to come closer to the ah.

  body: Curve the horizontal of the h more to make it look like part of a single stroke.

  body: "thanks everybody some great suggestions there I'll give it a go and post
    up some new versions. \r\n\r\nEspecially like the single stroke idea. I know there's
    no 'need' for a ligature but it just feels clumsy otherwise. Unless I can edit
    the serifs like Eben suggests. And I agree \u2013 the space between the characters
    is definitely bit too close at the moment\u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ok here's the latest version.\r\n\r\nI tried the flowing approach but I think
    it's a bit too much for this one. I just need to make them sit together well and
    it needs to be almost invisible/discreet.\r\n\r\nSo I've just been working on
    opening it up a bit and reducing the size of all the left side serifs.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I also decided to mirror the way the horizontal of the h meets the stem (that
    slightly strange - but interesting taper) with the lower part of the a (circled
    in blue).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_13March_5888.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    second file here is a slightly odd idea. I don't know what I think of it yet but
    it's interesting. Still have to try losing the lig and just tweaking serifs...\r\n\r\nall
    comments appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_13March_2_4908.png]"

  body: I think the 2nd one reads better, but both of them are good now. I will be
    interested to see how you fare with the serifs.  And idea - what if the dots got
    progressively smaller?

  body: "Right, thanks for comments \u2013 think it's getting there now. \r\nHere
    it is with the serifs tweaked and no ligature (let's call this A):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_2_4444.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's the second one in the previous set with updated ellipses (B):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_3_5553.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally, a new sort of hybrid that's a bit more flowing (C):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_4649.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting
    idea with the dots getting smaller Eben \u2013 but I've tried it and I don't think
    it's quite right. Possibly just a bit too much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks everybody for
    comments and help \u2013 let me know which one you prefer and I'll be sure to
    post up results when this gets printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A works best for me. That is exactly what I meant. The dots are getting too
    small to me though. They are starting to feel like an afterthought, but they are
    not. Quite the opposite. Take them away & the meaning changes too much. That part
    will be tough. \r\n\r\nYou could work more on the lig still if you wanted to by
    maybe tucking in the serif a tiny bit more -  but that's not the weakest link
    anymore in my opinion."
