  Very simple and modern-looking which is what I would like to incorporate in my website.
  Anyways, the link is: www.magscapes.com. I would like if someone could identify
  the logo font, the main font, and maybe all the other fonts used if you get a kick
  out of it! I know these fonts look really simple, but I''m not a font expert and
  would really appreciate your help. Thanks for sharing your knowledge.'
