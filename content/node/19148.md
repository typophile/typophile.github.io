  that simply displays the number of kerning pairs for a given font.\r\n\r\nI know
  that Suitcase Fusion with Font Sense does this, but that's a bit much just to check
  for kerning. Font Book, which comes with OS X Tiger, is nice and simple but gives
  no kerning info.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    new FontExplorer X is capable of this?
