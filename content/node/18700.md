body: 'I know "readiblity" is a very common topic, but I was wondering about this
  specific issue: is ANY "slant" going to hurt readability in blocks of body text?
  Roman always seems based on a strict vertical orientation, with a strict horizontal,
  perpendicular base. I''m not talking about "italics" so much as subtler variations
  between roman and ital. Any thoughts?'

  body: CLARIFICATION! I don't mean to suggest that all roman fonts are strictly "vertical"
    in terms of their strokes, bowls, etc. I mean in terms of the overall perpendicularity
    to the baseline. Variations of thick-thin along a diagonal axis is, of course,
    a property of plenty of otherwise vertical, roman typefaces. I'm referring to
    those that are slightly off that perpendicular, without looking italic or wackily
    slanted. I suppose I need an example of what the hell I'm jibbering about.

    started working up a reply in my head!  :-)\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons to think
    that slant harms readability:\r\n1) People aren't used to it (in long stretches).\r\n2)
    It distorts the boumas readers expect, for example by confusingly offsetting the
    ascenders and descenders in bouma silhouettes. Our Peter E might be able to throw
    one of his image-processing algorithms at this and come up with interesting insights
    (although he's actually not a silhouette fan for one thing).\r\n\r\nFonts with
    less slant presumably suffer less, although they can have another problem: especially
    at small sizes and/or bad output conditions, the difference between Roman and
    Italic can fade. BTW, this is why the so-called \"upright Italic\" style can't
    work as an Italic (which is why I prefer calling it \"cursive Roman\").\r\n\r\nSome
    notable slightly-slanted Romans:\r\nSyntax (1/2 degree)\r\nRialto (1 degree)\r\nSeria
    (variable, ~1 degree)\r\nFlora (~2 degrees?)\r\n\r\nIn Nour&Patria, the slant
    (in Nour's Armenian and subordinate Latin, and its Latin italic) is 1/16*, which
    is about 3.6 degrees. This seems to be the least slant one can safely have (in
    a text face). I think it's safe enough that Nour's subordinate Latin (codenamed
    Harrier)** can be used for setting a (short) book.\r\n\r\n* In digital fonts I
    think it makes more sense to use integer slopes\r\ninstead of degrees. The latter
    is a pretty arbitrary measure, while\r\nthe former allows easy control over slope
    segments.\r\n\r\n** http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n>

    anybody's) are good enough.\r\nThey don't seem to be (although still, \"he's our

  body: THanks for the examples, hrant. Isn't the very idea of the "bouma" debatable,
    though? My sense is that the debates is that either (a) we recognize word-outline
    shapes at first pass, then further refine cognitively, or that (b) we parallel-process
    individual letters in groups at first pass, then further refine cognitively. I
    guess the result is kind of the same, and might even perhaps be hypotheses that
    predict much the same reading behaviors, but strictly-speaking they are different
    cognitive-perceptual animals, right? Frankly, I don't believe much in boumas;
    I prefer (b). But that's just me.

    course.\r\n\r\nOne thing though: boumas aren't necessarily whole words. Essentially
    they're letter clusters, deciphered as wholes thanks to frequency, distinctiveness,
    the experience of the reader, the semantic context of the text, the clarity with
    which it's seen (how close to the fixation point*) and yes, word boundaries as
    well.\r\n\r\n* In fact the decipherment of single letters -which is indeed the
    norm in the fovea- can be seen as a special case of bouma decipherment. But the
    more experienced the reader (to me the prime target of improving readability,
    because the rest is mostly just legibility, a different -and simpler, if only
    pragmatically- problem) the more important the -blurry- parafovea is.\r\n\r\n>

    I.e., more transformations from letter to letter, even among similarly-shaped

    individual letters vs. a bouma model?\r\n\r\nand as for \"good letterspacing,\"

    think I have an incorrect picture of what you are proposing. It may be that I
    am misslead by your identification in Typo #13 of parafoveal recognition as the
    hidden core of reading into thinking that the only role you see for foveal vision
    is in correcting missreadings, confirming readings when there are confusions caused
    by grammatical or syntactical oddities, and decoding unfamiliar words. So that
    optimization of reading performance really amounts to superceeding the foveal
    bottleneck by making it's contributions redundant.\r\n\r\nAre you not conceding
    the fovea to the proponents of a cognitive scientific misappropriation of the
    data and then doing an end-run around it that makes it seem that a compensatory
    mechanism dyslexics use (if Gad Geiger and Jerome Lettvin are correct) is the
    norm, or at least, that is how your scheme sometimes looks from here. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    but for the sake of clarifying certain -often terse- things I've said in this
    thread (like \"research sucketh\") let me elaborate: the problem with almost the
    entire corpus of reading research is that the tests, the subjects, and the environments
    are not conducive to immersion; this does not prevent people from reading, but
    it does prevent the exposition of what happens when an experienced reader gets
    immersed, and hence how type designers can make any difference. In 99% of tests,
    the subjects are hovering between deliberation and light immersion, so speeds
    are slow, and things like serifs, the paucity of wordspaces in German, etc. never
    get a chance to matter.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is that people relying on such tests
    to tell them everything they need to know tend to see no reason to believe there
    might be a dark twin world. But the telltale signs (like the missing of typos,
    the existence of regressions, the foveal skipping of words*, etc.) should not
    be ignored, and anecdotal experience (like \"use a serif for a long book\") should
    not be shunned. The signs and the experience, coupled to a belief that the subconscious
    brain is an hyper-efficient heuristic beast, should put the parallel-letterwise
    reading model firmly in the half-world where it belongs for any objective, non-room-temperature-IQ
    person.\r\n\r\n* Some words being short, frequent and distinctive enough to show
    up on the radar of even some of the most near-sighted empirical testing.\r\n\r\nNow,

    1860s-70s when American \"gentleman scholars\" had to move over for the youngbloods
    who got their PhDs in Germany and came back to set up the first research uni's
    here. In fact, the immediate backlash of that new trend resulted in the first
    real \"generalist vs. specialist\" debates in my own field of rhetoric and communication
    (see Quarterly Journal of Speech ca. 1914-1920).\r\n\r\nWhat I think we need is
    more in the way of \"interdisciplinary\" centers that bring together typophiles--
    with their sense of art and history-- and researchers-- with their sense of controlled
    experimentation, operationalization of fuzzy-headed notions, etc. I bet this already

    people. But others prefer blind, controlled experimentation, in the model of modern
    hypothesis testing. What is the point of saying the former is \"folk\" and thereby
    \"not science\" while the other is \"really science\"? The only point is to control
    what counts as knowledge in a certain kind of market economy. \r\n\r\nBut the
    interesting thing to me is, after a while, people who are \"real science\" chauvinists
    sometimes come around to say, hey, these aren't mutually exclusive territories
    here. The National Institute of Health in the U.S., for example, now has a large
    and highly-regarded <a href=\"http://nccam.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">department
    for examining traditional medicine</a>.\r\n\r\nGranted, this is still a kind of
    absorbtion or co-optation of \"traditional\" by \"modern,\" but at least it bespeaks
    an attempt to build a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe relevance to typography seems obvious
    to me: it's not art VERSUS science, or tradition VERSUS modern, or intuitive VERSUS
    quantifiable. The wisdom of what Donald Schon calls the \"reflective practitioner\"
    actually MUST be build on syntheses of these. No amount of basic-science knowledge
    in a specific field will ensure you make good <em>decisions</em> as a lawyer,
    teacher, designer, etc. \r\n\r\n- J"

    quote from Keith Rayner's excellent paper \"20 Years of Eye Movements\". From
    the section titled What Causes Regressions?:\r\n\r\nReaders are much more likely
    to regress to a word on the current line than to words on previous lines. However,
    when they do regress further back in tect, although there are sometimes backtracking
    movements readers often have fairly good spatial memories for where they went
    wrong in comprehension and make fairly accurate saccades to that region of text.
    Frazier and Rayner (1982) also demonstrated that when readers encountered a word
    indicating that their prior interpretation of the sentence was in error, they
    often made a regression as soon as they encountered disambiguating information.
    It is likely that many regressions are due to comprehension failures. However,
    many regressions are very short saccades and are probably due to oculomotor errors.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    might hold even less water than you/I think (which\r\nis what Peter has been saying).</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't follow. Kevin indicates that fixation regressions happen when the reader
    realises that a sentence doesn't make sense and that a previous word must have
    been misread. The parallel letter recognition model as explained by Kevin at the
    Vancouver ATypI conference and in subsequent publications involves a feedback
    and efficiency process by which letters recognition is key to word recognition
    but possible word identity is 'guessed at' during the process. So the identity
    of a word might be guessed at before all the letters are identified, and the reader
    might move on to the next fixation. The speed benefits of this feedback and efficiency
    process are obvious, but sometimes the reader guesses incorrectly, realises this
    at a later fixation what the content doesn't make sense, and regresses to correct
    the misidentification.\r\n\r\nWhat I find interesting in this kind of regression
    is the idea that we might have flagged the misidentified word, in order to know
    where to regress to if necessary. That is, the brain might log a word as being
    90% certain that it has been correctly identified, and if the subsequent content
    does not make sense, a regression to that word is triggered. If the subsequent
    content does make sense, then the flag is cleared. I can conceive of a test that
    would indicate whether such regressions are precise in this way, or involve a
    process of searching, and wonder if any studies have been done in this particular
    area?"

  body: "<em> it may well be possible to make a readable italic</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    nonsense, and it highlights the peculiar meaning developing for the word \"readability\".\r\n\r\nFrom
    the perspective of general usage, \"readable\" means capable of being read. The
    bizarre meaning some scientists are pursuing apparently refers to two quite specific
    qualities, \"comprehension' and \"speed\", as measured over short sections of
    text in a laboratory, and with a very limited definition of \"comprehension\".
    Compare the word \"edible\" to \"readable\" -- all food is edible and edibility
    is not something that can be measured. What can be measured are things like nutritional
    content and calories; these have nothing to do with palatability or cuisine, another
    issue again from how fast and how much it's possible to eat. \r\n\r\nLet's not
    be misled into thinking there is somehow something wrong with type that is not
    \"readable\" according to a scientific alteration of the word's meaning, in particular
    using it in an unqualified manner. In fact, \"readability\" has absolutely no
    scientific meaning, so please stop using it, Kevin et al. What you're researching
    is properly termed reading ergonomics, which is what one would expect at Microsoft
    Advanced Reading Technology. Yeah, \"reading ergonomics\" is less contentious,
    and doesn't it sound more scientific than pirating a word from flakey typographer-speak?\r\n\r\nThe
    word \"readability\" entered the typographic vocabulary as a refinement to the
    concept of \"legibility\". It has a general meaning, applicable as much to a page
    layout as to a typeface. In the hierarchy of page layout, typographic readability
    applies at every level. Really, it means good typography! In other words, not
    too loose, too busy, too dense, too regimented, or too \"regressive\", but just
    right. And yes, it may be applied to a typeface, but that typeface always has
    to be set, and will be uniquely effected by the typographic variables.\r\n\r\nSo
    what the altered concept of \"readability\" does is to define good typography
    in limited, quantifiable terms, with \"better\" meaning things like \"3% faster\".
    \r\n\r\nFor the typographer, working at the level of page layout, the main text
    may be set in roman, and to add interest, a sidebar in italic. Ironic that the
    \"unreadable\" italic adds readability to the page! As a leavening of italic is
    common practice, it's hardly surprising that snatches of italic will be read slower
    than roman in lab tests, because readers spend the vast majority of their time
    reading roman. This suggests that the social sciences have more to reveal about
    this phenomenon than lab tests -- statistical analysis of populations and reading
    material. That's where the answer to Hrant's \"Familiarity\" lies. Or else you'd
    have to construct a desert-island laboratory which isolated and controlled the
    subjects' reading material for months on end. Or twins, one brought up reading
    roman, the other italic. Or quads, with added sans/serif split. Clones in alternate
    Truman Shows. \r\n\r\nAt the level of paragraph layout, the full range of typographic
    nuance comes into effect. To  raise the text from a solid mass of letters, the
    typographer adjusts the values of leading, paragraph indent, line length, type
    size, flush/justified, h&j settings, paragraph leading, and type style. Don't
    forget paper stock and ink colour, or what happens on monitors.\r\n\r\nWith thousands
    of typefaces to choose from, and so many different ways to set them, to make a
    work as \"readable\" as possible, it's impossible to test all the combinations
    in a lab, to discount the effect of untested variables. I was discussing news
    text with a newspaper designer the other day, and he mentioned that in North America,
    8.6 pt was the preferred size, but in Europe 8.2 pt (maybe not those exact numbers,
    but you get the idea).\r\n\r\nAnother analogy, with music. The same score may
    be played by different performers, with marked difference in \"listenability\".
    \r\n\r\n<em>How would you improve reading performance?</em>\r\n\r\nSo, hire a
    typographer.\r\nAnd for typeface design, someone with a good hand and eye, ideas,
    and experience.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAgain, I would suggest taking research out of
    the lab and into the field.\r\nPhilosophically, compare the ergonomics of reading
    with ergonomics in other areas of design.\r\n\r\nSorry, I broke my new year's
    resolution not to use the word \"readability\". In future I'll replace it with
    \"reading ergonomics\".\r\n"

    that are not the result of occulomotor errors, but of comprehension errors) are
    to previously fixated words? From the diagrams I\u2019ve seen, including yours
    in Typo#13 this often happens but not always.\r\nThat is correct. Some, but not
    all, regressive saccades are to words that have been previously foveally fixated.\r\n\r\n>>It\u2019s

    When I mean people read faster or with higher accuracy, that is what I will say.
    My program of research is developing new measures of readability which include
    speed and comprehension, but also include aesthetic quality, eye fatigue, and
    mental effort.\r\n\r\nCheers, Kevin\r\n"

    readers have an undifferentiated grip on the visual form of words. They don't
    have 'maximal grip', and a large amount of  attentional resources are used in
    simple orthographic and phonological decoding. In experience motivated readers
    the distribution of attentional resources shifts almost completely to sense following.

    due to increased speed, because the former is the determinant while the latter

    in his statement is that it assumes Familiarity is gained over a lifetime. It's
    not impossible that that's the case, but it's also possible (in fact from what
    I've read, seen and thought I think it's probable) that Familiarity is gained
    very quickly, maybe a few days, maybe even a couple of hours*. If this is the
    case, it becomes quite possible to test for it, factor it in/out, etc.\r\n\r\n*
    Which is absolutely not to say that Familiarity is all that; there are neurological
    and physiological realities about us that affect/limit reading in particular ways,
    and no amount of Familiarity can turn us into ethereal, abstract beings.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I was responding to your question about the possibility of controling for familiarity.
    I think the tests that I have described have a lot of external validity because
    they test readers with typical experiences. There may be reasons to create a group
    of readers with unusual experiences (your Floride comment?), but there should
    be a compelling reason to do it. I would love to run more tests with children,
    the elderly, people with low vision, and dyslexics, and would do so with sufficient
    time and resources. Tinker and others have studied children and would happily
    find you some references if you are interested.*\r\n\r\n* Tinker, M.A. (1935).
    Studies in scientific typography for children. Psychological Bulletin, 32, 703.\r\n\r\nHrant,
    I concur that familiarity may be acquired very quickly. How do we tell when an
    adequate level of familiarity has been acquired? It is a quibble, but I think
    anecdotalism is necessary and important for hypothesis generation, but will always
    choose to believe empirical data when it is available.\r\n\r\nCheers, Kevin\r\n"

    one, which I explained in my TYPO 13 piece: to gauge what might be happening at
    the \"high boundary\" of reading, to then base action on; instead of simply trying
    to nail down the barren, ho-hum average, which only teaches us what that average
    is. In this case the subjects' \"unusual experience\" would be one more people
