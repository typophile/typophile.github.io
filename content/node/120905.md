  body: "What make you think it's not Constantine?\r\nThe differences you see could
    be because lowercase was used.\r\nOn the designer's site there also are a bold
    and outline versions:\r\nhttp://dukom.org/portfolio/constantine-family/"

  body: The typefaces I can find which are named "Chisel" look nowhere like the sample.

  body: "There is Cinzel (upon which Constantine is based, or inspired by, depending
    on where you read on the author's site. I would say more based-on than inspired).\r\nCinzel
    (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cinzel) has a Decorative cut, which has an
    |S| shaped like the one in the sample, but much finer serifs. So, I agree it's
    Cinzel, but with an outer stroke applied to it (wich would also explain the strange
    square gap in the |R|)."
