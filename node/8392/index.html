		<div class="commentbody">Given the fact that the first secretaries were male, it was a natural progression for men to become typesetters. <BR> <BR>There were women who were involved with publications (mostly writing of course) and printing, beginning in the colonial era. &quot;Amelia Bloomer advocated dress reform, temperance, and women's rights in <i>The Lily</i>, which she began in 1849. Her later decision to employ only female typesetters met with opposition from male printers.&quot;  (Now that's earlier than I had imagined!) <BR> <BR>It wasn't really until the 1920s that women took up jobs in the typesetting field (that men would have had) - and even then, given the choice, most women pursued journalistic roles. (This might have had something to do with the fact that they didn't earn equal pay for the same job until the early 1960s.) <BR> <BR>I read that in the US, in 1989, only 7.5 percent of engineers were women. Interesting eh?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Famously, Monotype's drawing office was staffed almost entirely by women from, I believe, the 1930s. These were not type designers per se &ndash; that was a field almost entirely dominated by men, although there were women lettering artists who contributed to fine press book design (Anna Simons' work for the Bremer Presse is probably the best known and most highly regarded) &ndash;, but the people responsible for the precise manufacturing drawings.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;it was a natural progression for men to become typesetters. <BR> <BR>There is no such thing as a &quot;natural progression for men&quot;. In the first place, women have been left out of the history books, their contributions generally attributed to their spouses*. This is especially true where the family is the business, rather than the factory, and that was the usual situation before the Industrial Revolution with its specialization.  <BR> <BR>Did printers' guilds prohibit women from working in a print shop? It's a subject for specialist research, but I suspect that from the earliest days of typography, there was always a percentage of practising women. <BR> <BR> <BR>*Even in modern creative partnerships, the woman's name is the lesser in public awareness: Charles Eames, 177,000 Google search results; Ray Eames, 113,000. <BR> <BR>Secondly, the UN-natural &quot;progressions&quot; are far more interesting. Such as the introduction of the typewriter in the 1870s, quickly monopolized by women, becoming a key instrument (sorry) of their financial emancipation.</div>
