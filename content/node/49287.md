body: "Just wondering if there is any foundry that produces Palatino (or a close enough
  typeface that could masquerade as it) in a medium weight and includes old-style
  figures (and preferably true small caps)?\r\n\r\nI require them for a few samples
  of light on dark text. I have actually created my own versions of the figures in
  Illustrator, but have never created a font before and don't want to put in all the
  work for this project if I don't have to.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm guessing
  Palatino nova will be the closest find, any others?"

  body: "You're both correct, the original Palatino and the Windows shipping Palatino
    Linotype both include old-style figures and small caps (I use the latter regularly).
    The problem is they only come in their regular and bold weights. Every Medium
    weight I've come across so far has only ever included the default lining figures.
    This is what I'm after.\r\n\r\nMy own attempt in Illustrator was actually done
    by average the regular and bold weighted versions. Probably a major typography
    no-no! Of course this makes the hunt for a legitimate copy even more important!
    :D"

    medium weights, including all the bells and whistles..... That is as \"legitimate\"
    as you're likely to get, unless you can find an old Adobe product on eBay with
    SCOSF faces included. \r\n"

  body: "Sure, but I've just presumed that my untrained eye simply can't see the differences
    between Palatino and Nova and that if an original Palatino exists with these features
    then surely it would be better (again, even if I can't see the subtle improvement
    myself).\r\n\r\nSo if I have the type experts confirmation that Nova is good enough
    and I wont be causing a typographic sin by mixing Palatino nova into an existing
    promotional environment of Palatino Linotype then I'll go shell out the cash for
    it! :D"
