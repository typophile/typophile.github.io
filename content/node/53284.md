body: "I'm a big fan of Renner's original lowercase 'g' which was rejected and eventually
  replaced with the current one. Does anyone know if a Futura font exists that contains
  the original 'g' as a alt character? Is it available in any other form?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RennerG_6738.jpg]"
