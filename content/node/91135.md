  body: "My first job after leaving college was with a medical journal. I was young
    and wanted to change the medical-journal-world. Ahh, the arrogance of youth. Academics
    in general and perhaps medical academics in particular tend to be conservative
    by nature and, as such, would tend to respond to suggested change with \"That's
    not the way we do it\" or similar.\r\n\r\nFortunately I had a good grounding in
    straightforward, basic typography like the example cited above, and although it
    wasn't very exciting to do, it was gratifying when the changes were recognised
    as a significant improvement.\r\n\r\nThe major battle I had was not with the readers
    or with the contributors but with the editor who had her self-devised hierarchy
    of headings and sub-headings which numbered eight all told and she could easily
    find a case for a ninth or tenth. It took a while and a lot of flirting and buttering-up,
    but I at last persuaded her that four was enough."

  body: Matthew, this is not strictly medical-related, but between 1955 and 1968 the
    great Jan Tschichold was hired as graphic consultant for the pharmaceutical company
    Hoffmann-La Roche where he designed, among other things, their house organ. I
    have seen some samples in Christopher Burke's excellent book about Tschichold,
    and they look lika a very interesting example of corporate pharm design.
