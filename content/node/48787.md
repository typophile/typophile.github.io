  body: "Hey\r\nIts reads as HUB, I was just experimenting with repeating patterns
    and optic illusions. \r\nI wanted something edgy and bold, that will catch your
    eye when viewed. \r\nIve created a typeface off of the logo as well. "

  body: "I think it looks pretty good and I like the concept but I'm wondering if
    maybe it's a little <em>too</em> hard to read.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to think about
    is how small will this be replicated. It's quite likely that on a business card
    the small lines may not hold up. You could test it by printing one out at an inch
    wide or so.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tylorjreimer.com/\">Tylor

  body: "I agree with tylor. Make that logo about 1/4\" and see what you get. If you
    absolutely want all those lines, then I would consider two versions with a more
    simple version for certain uses. If you do that, be sure and address in your usage
    guide precisely when each version gets used. Better yet, I would simplify it to
    work in all circumstances or you will wind up with the wrong one all the time.
    It is just human nature for clients to get it wrong.\r\n\r\nI did not see the
    word Hub at all."
