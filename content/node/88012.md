body: What terms are usually found in a resale contract? What percentage of the sale
  price does the vendor usually retain? I'm interested in knowing both what is typical
  and what the type community feels is reasonable.

  body: When considering the distributers marketing fee as part of the take, you must
    remember that the more fonts the distributor is marketing, the shorter the amount
    of time you get for the marketing of yours. Basically, if they get a large percentage
    of your royalty in perpetuity and market your font for one month, is that really
    worth it?

  body: "It depends on a few things, not least how much the\r\nfont house spends on
    marketing, and how much\r\nthey help you finish the font files (e.g. hinting).\r\n\r\nI've
    seen it from a high of 90% (Emigre) to a low of 20%\r\n(MyFonts up to 2003). I'd
    say the average might be around\r\n75%. What's fair? That's a great, super-complex
    question.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that you could upload?

  body: It <em>is</em> a super-complex question (as Hrant says) and it's wise to consider
    more than just percentages, or even that there are only two options. I wrote <a
    href="http://typographica.org/2008/on-typography/taking-your-fonts-to-market-foundry-reseller-or-go-solo/">this
    guide</a> 3 years ago and not much has changed except the landscape of major distributors
    (MyFonts is now owned by Monotype and Veer's dedication to fonts seems to be sinking)
    but the positives and negatives to the three routes are essentially the same.

  body: ">Taking Your Fonts to Market: Foundry, Reseller, or Go Solo?\r\n\r\nThat
    was a very good article on all the pros and cons. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAside from what
    has already been mentioned, I would simply like to say that, if you just want
    to design type, and do not have enough time in the day to market your own stuff,
    just go with 3-4 of the big distributors. Done.\r\n\r\nA fair percentage would
    be 40%-50% split.\r\n\r\nMyfonts has the most traffic, and in my opinion will
    get you the most bang for your buck.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason 'Monotype' bought
    Bitstream's font business recently. Smart move on their part.\r\n\r\nAnd if you
    are lucky, and in the first month your font(s) rise to the top of their popularity
    list, you could make some good money.\r\n\r\nCreate a few promotional banners
    to further help promote your stuff. Couldn't hurt. The more exposure the better.\r\n\r\nAnd
    besides, if you get the time, down-the-road, nothing stopping you from creating
    your own web site and selling your fonts directly.\r\n\r\nJust do not sign any
    'exclusivity' contract. Sell to anyone and everyone. You'll soon discovery what
    works for you and which distribution channels work best.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
