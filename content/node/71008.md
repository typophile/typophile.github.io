  body: Note that this is drawn by hand as most of the maps of that era were. That
    said, Sirenne is definitely tbe best example of a digital font in the style. H&FJ
    designed something called Surveyor for Martha Stewart which is similar. See also
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/kursivschrift_pro_virtual/">Kursivschrift</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/roemisch_com_complete_family_value_pack/">Roemisch</a>,
    other vintage cartographic typefaces.

    called <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1820-modern/\">1820 Modern</a>
    and also has SC and italic faces, as did the previous one I posted.\r\n\r\n- Mike
