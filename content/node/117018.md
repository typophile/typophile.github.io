    Grotesk]] might work as well... Your best chance is probably to track down this
    graphic and ask directly the author.\r\n\r\nEDIT: after further inspection, [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/sansation|Sansation]]
    might match."

    \ 'Carnova' \r\nIf the designer used two fonts,  <strong>Lemon</strong> may be
    \ 'Core Sans Bold' \r\nand Tree perhaps 'Norpeth Medium' \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nMichiel"
