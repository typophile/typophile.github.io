  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm looking to purchase an entire font family soon. But as you all know, it's an investment. I'm torn between Scala Sans and Freight Sans. Basically, I'm looking for a family that has a wide range of applications (from text to signage). Also, which one of these fonts do you think has the best companion serif design? (I'll purchase this family in the near future) Which one is the best value for the money? Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Value is essentially the same, though you can buy individual weights of [[FF Scala]], if that makes sense for your needs.

As for style, FF Scala is more distinctive so may not be as useful for a broad range of jobs.

Keep in mind that Freight is spaced very tightly so will need some extra care for text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I needed a combination of sans and serif that would work well together in a single word. After trying to pair various combinations I started to look for a not too expensive family with both. I liked Freight text's italic k and r and the clean shapes of the sans. In the end it's all subjective, I just liked the font. I might not have bought all varieties had that been an option, but now I'm happy it wasn't. Still looking for an project that would give me an excuse to buy the Micro.
I didn't realise it was such a popular one when I bought it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William - I think any family with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/virtual/newsletters/jun2006_b/">serif and sans companions</a> is appealing simply due to its versatility. As for Freight's popularity, these all factor in:

- The sans hits all the right notes for contemporary typography: large x-height, open forms, wide, nothing too quirky but more humanist than geometric.
- <a href="http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop">Darden's documentation and samples</a> lend it a lot of credibility.
- The Micro weight is intriguing.

Stephen, what's interesting is that your rather complete list is pretty short. By the way I'm surprised you didn't include Scala & Scala sans in your 'pairs' list, as I think this was the first one so designed and very successful, no? </div>

However, I'm not so sure about sans+serif families.
No harm in foundries offering both, but that doesn't mean they should be bought and used as a team.
I was just looking at a clipping from Hi-Fi magazine, 1964 (it came in an old vinyl album -- a nice bonus!):

I'm not sure how the other terms compare because I can't find the FS EULA on their site...one used to be able to view it during the purchase process BEFORE the actual "give us your credit card" screen, but just now I tried that and got to the credit card step without being presented with an EULA.

Warning: rant ahead:
Hmmmm....I wish foundries would make their EULAs easily discoverable. It seems odd that users are expected to sleuth around for the terms before purchasing, yet over and over again, we are told how important these agreements are to the foundries!</div>

I agree 100%. Though I love the 'W' in Scala sans I think it would limit me as far as usage. Also thanks for the Serif and Sans companion list, very helpful.

I'm starting to do more freelance design and I feel my designs are only as good as it's typography. So I feel I have to invest in good, durable typography at a good price.

		<div class="commentbody">[[FontBook]] is not really an "FF" publication. It's published by FontShop International. FontFont is simply FontShop's foundry, a "house label" if you will. But I understand the confusion between the two brands. 

Regardless, <a href="http://www.fontfont.com">FontFont.com</a>, <a href="http://fontshop.com">FontShop.com</a> and <a href="http://www.fontbook.com>FontBook.com</a> will all lead you to the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook.cfm">FontBook page</a>. As you're in Perth, you'll need to contact FS Australia for delivery.</div>

I have nothing against the typeface itself but it reminds me of being fresh out of university and working at a job I hated to pay the bills. Maybe the new serif version will help me get over my negativity? I second the call for a peek!!! Don't tease us!!!</div>
