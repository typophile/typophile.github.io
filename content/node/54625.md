body: "We have developed a Flash app called FontShaker, a new way to visually explore
  fonts installed on a local machine.  It also provides a place to save comments,
  tags, rating and samples; these can be kept as personal or shared with the wider
  community.  Within FontShaker you can sort fonts by various criteria, and use the
  \u201CFind Similar\u201D function to find related fonts (installed locally or commercially
  available).  Any data you save in FontShaker can later be fed back into your own
  copy of the TypeDNA Font Manager (soon to be released).\r\n\r\nI would like to invite
  Typophile members to take a look before we make a media announcement and would be
  interested to hear if anyone notices any specific fonts missing, letting me know
  which foundry they belong.\r\n\r\nDarren (TypeDNA : Development Director). \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typedna.com/fontshaker\r\n"
