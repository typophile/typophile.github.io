    class!</em>\r\n\r\nSorry 'bout the misunderstanding, Bob, as I moderate this part
    of Typophile that would've been me. You pointing to H&FJ Greenback made me jump
    to conclusions a bit too fast. You see, we have received quite a few dubious requests
    in the past , like type on passports, credit cards, currency et al, so we'd rather
    be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nIt would help if you were a bit more specific and used
    a more descriptive thread title. \"Help ID Font...\" is pretty redundant, as that's
    all we do around here. :^)\r\n\r\nOh, and I <em>will</em> change the subject line
    again, to allow our type IDers to quickly scan the list of threads in search of
    requests they might have the answer for."
