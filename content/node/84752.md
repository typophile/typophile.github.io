body: "So, I am usually fairly savvy when it comes to finding the font I am looking
  for, but this one has got me jammed. Any of the font identification programs aren't
  working - the attributes are quite common I think, and I have not even pulled up
  anything close.\r\n\r\nI am recreating this logo for this football team and although
  I did my best to clean the jpg I was given, now I must create the vector logo for
  vinyl and the inconsistencies in the letters are killing me. So I don't have to
  just redraw these letters, could someone please help me identify this font?\r\n\r\nYour
  help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    how to remove it, I would, sorry. I thought I attached a file, but apparently
    I didn't. This \"insert image\" did nothing the first time. Let's try that again.
