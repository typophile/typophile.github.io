  I&#39;m considering using Whitman for the body text. Does anyone know of a good
  sans companion? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.

  body: You know what&#39;s eerie, Tamara? I just dropped into the Design thread to
    ask the <i>exact same question</i>. I don&#39;t mean to hijack your thread, so
    I&#39;ll just observe and contribute what I can to your design problem. <BR> <BR>My
    initial thought was to use a strong, clean geometric grotesque like Hoefler&#39;s
    Gotham or a modern sans like Font Bureau&#39;s Interstate, but I realized it&#39;s
    the all-caps settings that I&#39;m drawn to with those faces, not necessarily
    the mixed settings, which is how I&#39;ll most likely need to set the heads. Those
    are also probably my personal preferences coming through, and they may not give
    the right tone to the setting for a corporate publication. However, I haven

  body: I would not use a neo-grotesque such as Univers or Helvetica. They&#39;re
    from a distinctly later era and feel a little too modern to me. <BR> <BR>I think
    a range of things would work, whether Gill Sans, Futura, Metro or Franklin Gothic
    &#40;just a few possibilities&#41;. Metro in particular was a Dwiggins sans serif.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, Kent Lew hangs out here, and as the designer of Whitman I&#39;m
    sure he&#39;s thought about this a lot. I&#39;ll be curious to hear his take on
    it. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'You know, I could swear I posted something on this in another thread, not
    that long ago. I get this question a lot. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to separate out
    my own personal tastes. &#40;For instance, I personally really don&#39;t like
    Futura or Helvetica and I&#39;m tired of Gill Sans, but that doesn&#39;t mean
    that a skillful designer couldn&#39;t make them work with Whitman, maybe.&#41;
    So don&#39;t take anything I say as gospel. <BR> <BR>Chris, if you&#39;re interested
    in a bold condensed, then I think the bolder weights of Franklin Gothic Condensed
    might be worth a look. I&#39;ve been mostly using both Gotham and Franklin Gothic
    with Whitman lately. <BR> <BR>I think Thomas&#39;s suggestion of Metro might make
    an interesting pairing, given the pedigree. But you&#39;d have to try it out.

    Scroll down to April 23. <BR> <BR>But <i>I&#39;m</i> really curious what others

  body: Here&#39;s another possibility I forgot to mention earlier. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    heard that the New York 2010 Olympic bid committee has chosen to pair Whitman
    with HTF&#39;s Knockout for their campaign. Could be an interesting combination
    if handled carefully. I&#39;m curious to see what they come up with. <BR> <BR>Tamara
    and Chris, I would love to know what you end up trying, what works and what doesn&#39;t
    work for you. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: 'FF Scala Sans would be a good match -- like Whitman, it&#39;s not a revival
    of a specific face, but a face in a traditional &#34;humanist&#34; style, and
    the proportions are similar. <BR> <BR>Giacomo &#40;from Terminal&#41; would perhaps
    be better -- it has a similar roundness to its curves. '

  body: Thanks for your help everyone. I decided to go with Metro. It&#39;s working
    out pretty nicely. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t own some of the suggestions so I
    couldn&#39;t test everything. Franklin Gothic worked nicely...but Metro has a
    friendlier, less heavy feel that works better for the dry subject matter.
