  first line of text of this site's logo: http://www.gourmetkoshertogo.com\r\n\r\nThe
  bottom line looks like futuraBT, but I can't figure out the top line.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nI
  also cant tell if that's really the lowercase output or if it's just smaller caps...?\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\ndid
  a screen grab and uploaded an image for you\r\n\r\nHelp?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

      packages? Wonder if I have it and don't know it..."
