body: "A couple of days ago a friend IM'd me asking for a font recommendation. Then
  he asked me I had the font in a kinda off-hand 'can I have it?' kinda way. I said
  'You are gonna buy it and not download it, right?' \r\n\r\nHe basically explained
  that they were pitching for some work (he works for a design agency) and one of
  the routes they were offering would contain this font but they didn't have a budget
  for a job they didn't yet have so usually he would 'borrow' a font of someone who
  already had it and then if the pitch was successful and the route chosen, they would
  then buy the font. \r\n\r\nInitially I thought he meant he would download it from
  some dodgy site so I hassled him for this saying it supports piracy even if he's
  ultimately buying the font. He meant however borrowing the font off someone they
  knew, ie. Me in this case. That aside, I suggested that he should just contact the
  foundry as they often provide a limited license for test purposes or something.
  His main complaint about this was that it often took so long for foundries to get
  back to him in the past that they were usually presenting the pitch by that time
  and it was too late. His argument was that they ultimately bought the font if it
  worked. Mine was that as a company they should invest in a decent set of fonts that
  they will work with regularly, in the same way they would invest in legitimate software
  and so on. \r\n\r\nBut I guess the question this raised was; is there a solution
  to the problem of quick turnaround when you may not have a font, or the necessary
  budget to buy it yet? \r\n\r\nI guess some people will say 'If you're not willing
  to pay for a font, then even if its only for a prospective job, don't use it.' But
  surely foundries will want people to use their fonts and maybe willing to 'lend'
  them out if there's a potential purchase down the line? \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n\r\nGraham\r\n"

  body: "I think you've identified a real problem.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see that there
    is a solution. Absent some fancy DRM system for fonts, a system of lending fonts
    out puts the value of product at risk. And doing so simply to deal with bureaucratic
    problems that their prospective customers ought to have straightened out on their
    own - it isn't a font foundry's fault if a company is badly organized and you
    need signatures from five levels to actually spend money on a font.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, there's another point of view, too: that while home computer users
    can use whatever font without being traced, businesses are visible, easy to sue,
    so in general they're trustworthy as far as obeying licenses is concerned.\r\n\r\nWorse
    yet, though, for type designers is the state of demand in the font market. Once
    people have the standards - Times Roman, Caledonia, Garamond, Lydian, Baskerville,
    Bodoni, Helvetica, Univers, Optima, Palatino, Copperplate Gothic, Eurostile, Clarendon
    - some well-known display fonts - Peignot, Hobo, Papyrus, Mistral, Ondine - and
    perhaps what is currently fashionable - Stone, Lucida - they're pretty much satisfied.\r\n\r\nArt
    departments at major publishers, advertising agencies, or companies, therefore,
    basically form the market that most of the typeface designers here are addressing.
    This is a very small market. And the people <em>in</em> that small market generally
    know their business... and probably don't need the help some sort of font lending
    system would give.\r\n\r\nSo the real problem is to expand the font market; to
    give a broader section of corporate customers, at least, reasons to get more creative
    in their choice of fonts to license. Giving the ordinary consumer choices beyond
    what comes with applications and those \"lousy font CDs\"... might be a challenge
    likely to remain unmet, but it's another frontier."

    could hire you (or the foundry) to set the sample he needs for a few cents per
    character, like back in the photo-compositing days."

    get back an AI file or an EPS file or whatever)?
