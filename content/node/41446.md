body: "I'm working on a factsheet design and was curious if there's a formula for
  figuring out [[column]] [[gutter]] widths.\r\n\r\nThe factsheet will be a single
  sided 8.5\" by 11\" sheet. The [[margin]]s will either be .25\" or .35\" on the
  right and left with a similar top margin and a .5 bottom margin. though, I might
  just go .5\" all around, it's still up in the air.\r\n\r\nI've decided to go with
  a 3 column layout, using 10/12 pt serifed type (probably <a href=\"http://type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=4&nomfuente=Karmina\">Karmina</a>).\r\n\r\nHopefully
  someone can enlighten me. Thanks. \r\n"

  body: "You need to make the gutter between columns wider than a space, of course.
    1 pica (1/6 of an inch) is about the minimum I would go with.\r\n\r\nOn a factsheet,
    keep in mind that it may get put into a binder, which calls for a 3/4 to 1 inch
    margin on the binding edge."

  body: "Awesome Don. Is there history reasoning behind the 1 pica minimum? \r\n\r\nThe
    factsheet will be going into a pocket folder for distribution. "

  body: History? I don't think so. In the old newspapers, a rule was put between columns,
    and I think they were about 4-6 points thick (not the rule, which was generally
    a half point or hairline, but the metal strip it sat on). When newspapers removed
    to a more open layout, with larger type sizes, often fewer and wider columns,
    the rules were removed and gutters were widened to give the visual separation
    between columns that used to be created by the rule (aka vertical line).

  body: That's a pretty good reason and understandable historically. I wasn't sure
    if there was a mathematical formula or something, but 1 pica sounds good to me.
    I'll go with it. Thanks Don.
