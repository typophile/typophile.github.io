body: "I'm developing an application that needs to display ordinary six-sided dice
  in a three-dimensional view. For technical reasons, implementing the dice graphics
  as glyphs in a font would be the most practical solution.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/game-pi/\">Linotype Game Pi</a>
  as a placeholder in my application, but since I obviously can't distribute that
  font, I have to replace it with my own before I release the program.\r\n\r\nHere's
  an image that shows what I've done so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Die_Spire_01_4832.png]<!--break-->\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's an image of the equivalent glyph in Linotype Game Pi (lowercase <cite>t</cite>)
  :\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Die_Linotype-Game-Pi_5652.png]\r\n\r\nThere
  is another font called <a href=\"http://www.partae.com/fonts/products/productinfo/productinfo.php?view=lasvegas\">Las
  Vegas</a> that also contains three-dimensional dice glyphs, but I don't have it
  at my disposal.\r\n\r\nThe target platform for my application is low-resolution
  Windows Mobile devices; typical screen dimensions are 240\xD7320, and high-end screen
  dimensions are 480\xD7640. The dice occupy only a fraction of the screen, so I need
  my design to be attractive and legible at very low PPEM values.\r\n\r\nI would be
  grateful for any comments and constructive criticism."

  body: "Anyone? (I hope I posted this in the right subforum.)\r\n\r\nI'm also working
    on an alternative version that's mostly the same but constructed by different
    means. I'm having a little trouble with it, but I might post it if I can whip
    it into shape."

  body: It looks good, and it's obviously much better than the Game Pi one. But if
    it's going to only be used at a specific small pixel size, there may be things
    you need to do to make it look best at that size. To get useful suggestions, show
    us what it would look like in the final product.
