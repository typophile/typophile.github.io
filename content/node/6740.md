body: Hello all- this my first post and I need a little help! I am working on an ambigram
  &#40;reads the same when seen upside down&#41; of a name and I&#39;m testing its
  legibility- can anyone take a stab at the letters?  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49266.gif"

  body: Well.. I would like to add, that, I like your ambigram logo type, a lot..
    Splendid.. <BR><i>And, as my first &#39;guess&#39; was &#39;Jamiely&#39;, maybe
    its even more legible / readable, than I first thought.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Decrease the return of the J&#39;s descender. It makes the &#34;y&#34; read
    as a &#34;p&#34;. I do not have the same superior reading capability as David
    so I was trying to figure out how the &#34;p&#34; fit into it. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    very well done, but if you&#39;re going for legibility, then I stand behind my
    suggestion. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: '- Try increasing the mi spacing combo. <BR>- The right leg of the m needs
    more weight. <BR>- Maybe a subtle little flat rectangular dot on the i &#40;not
    far off the stem&#41;. It would clear up that sequence and wouldn&#39;t hurt legibility
    on the m the other way. <BR>- The tricky part is the JA LY. Try adding a small
    flourish on the tail of your y moving right. It would add the left stroke on the
    top of the J and solve the d confusion. Scotts suggestion could work too. <BR>-
    Try the Ja connector at a little more of an angle and slightly thicker. It will
    help the y. <BR>- Your EM is genius. Get the bars on the e parallel, or as much
    as you can. The M will survive. <BR> <BR>Bravo'

  body: I think I got it. Now it&#39;s based off of officina sans- i think it works
    beter than the calligraphic version for a logo. any tips on improving the &#34;programmer/analyst&#34;
    / &#34;creator/developer&#34;? the former combo has only one more letter but the
    color is more uneven than expected. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50771.gif"

  body: This looks really cool. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having a real tough time reading
    the &#34;j&#34; and the &#34;y&#34;. I see an &#34;s&#34; in both cases. I wonder
    if you really need that curve at the top of the &#34;j&#34; and the bottom of
    the &#34;y&#34;. <BR> <BR>Programmer/Analyst, Creator/Developer

  body: Wow - that is cool! It makes my brain hurt trying to think of all the ways
    to create ambigrams.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally - which came first the letterform
    or the word? Did you seek to create a letterform for the word Jamiely or discover
    the word in playing around. I&#39;m not sure if Jamiely means anything as it hasn&#39;t
    really been a part of this discussion, but now that it looks like it is a logo
    and not just an exercise in ambigram it might be a question worth exploring. what
    will Jamiely mean to consumers. Other than the coolness of being able to turn
    it over and it say the same thing - although that is totally cool &#40;I have
    always been fond of xpedx&#39;s logo&#41; <BR> <BR>Could you perhaps shorten the
    I &#40;middle stroke of the m&#41; to add a slight bit of differentiation in that
    row of vertical strokes - it might help the eye find the letters a little easier.
    Without actually trying it, some guesses would be a dot above the I/under the
    middle m, or perhaps a curved tapering that would mirror the curve of the third
    leg of the m, but in the opposite direction - ending in a point. <BR> <BR>I agree
    with Scott that the J/Y could possibly be straightened a bit to avoid confusion.
    <BR> <BR>I think, however, the straight line of the two descriptors makes the
    ambigram nature of the logo more obvious to people at first glance. For some reason
    I don&#39;t have anyproblem reading the upside down type, and it shows kindof
    a two-face side to your work &#40;not in the bad way&#41; but that you wear the
    creative hat or the technical hat.

  body: I can tell you from experience that differentiating the <b>i</b> is important.
    &#34;Samuely&#34; still pops out at me. I would shear the top of the <b>i</b>
    at about 20 degrees, which also would only help the <b>m</b>. <BR> <BR>If possible,
    reverse one of the title pairs to position the slashes symmetrically. In fact,
    what I would do is divide the words with a round black bullet instead, and position
    it to serve at the dot of the <b>i</b>.
