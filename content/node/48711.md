body: "I want to get some feedback on a logo I've been working on. It's near it's
  final stages. The company name is RxLocal\u2014they are a medical marketing company.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on R & x together, along with incorporating a \"graph\" feel, to show the
  marketing sign. I think the combination of the Rx, and a \"graph like\" image will
  be enough to visually explain the company.\r\n\r\nThe Rx is a heavily modified News
  Gothic, which I'm still working on (part of the reason I want some feedback). Right
  now I have a few versions. I have a boxed version, the clients request. I also have
  a \"L\" shape version, which I came up with. I think it adds another element from
  a graph (X,Y plane) and also works as an \"L\" for local when the \"LOCAL\" text
  is dropped below the mark.\r\n\r\nThey wanted a green organic color, but I'm not
  totally set on the colors yet. I'm not sure if I like the Rx together or separated
  yet either. Let me know what you guys think so far.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/rxLocal/\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: "My thoughts:\r\n\r\n-The top part of the \"R\" doesn't sit well on its two
    legs. The top is too big and the legs are too skinny/awkwardly placed.\r\n\r\n-I
    don't care for the distorted looking arrow coming out of the top of the \"x\".
    I never like it very much when things look distorted when they don't have reason
    to be.\r\n\r\n-I do like the colors . . . reminds me of the european style pharmacy
    signs.\r\n\r\n-I'd like there to be perhaps more interaction between the \"R\"
    and the \"x\". Right now they're pretty static. I'm not sure if what you said
    about placing the \"R\" and \"x\" together meant making the \"x\" an extension
    of the \"R's\" right leg, but perhaps you should experiment with that placement
    - typical when referring to pharmacies and prescription drugs.\r\n\r\n-I like
    the simplicity you've got going here and I think you're on the right track. Hope
    some of my thoughts help you out.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: I like the concept quite a bit but I agree with pennANDink, the drawing of
    the letters is a bit off, and since the mark is primarily 2 letters, their appearing
    off balance is very distracting. I was wondering why not design the logo to be
    more reflective of  the traditional Rx (as described by pennANDink) are you consciously
    avoiding that?

  body: I would sketch some with a more jagged arrow - make it look more like a graph
    line. I also agree that dropping the 'x' down lower would be better - it would
    help with the interaction between the letters.

  body: "I disagree with one of the points that pennANDink is making which is the
    angle of the arrow on the x. The distortion of the arrow works well with the angle
    and creates perspective. \r\nIn my opinion, the logo that is working best is the
    lowest logo before the 4 horizontal ones because the X and Y lines get the idea
    of the graph across more. \r\n"

  body: "and in response ... the perspective is being broken by the fact that the
    shift in perspective is not being continued along the stroke of the 'x' which
    is where the distortion starts creeping in. As a concept it can work it just needs
    to be made more dynamic - imo.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: I'm having trouble with the angle of the arrow as well. It should follow the
    path of the x, rather then being distorted.

  body: "Yikes, I wouldn't call that finished. Even ignoring the Rx issues, the spacing
    and balance of the composition is all wrong. The position that the rx sits in
    within the L shape feels unbalanced, almost floating away. The LOCAL tag looks
    like an afterthought, the letter spacing is horrible and the size is disproportionate.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you say its finished thats your call i guess."
