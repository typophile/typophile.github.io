<p>Moral. Get FontLab, or something simliar, &amp; see what you can do. Lengthen the descenders, and maybe the ascenders a bit. Look at the contrast in the letterforms themselves, &amp; adjust as needed. Maybe expand it just a touch. There use to be a Times Wide, but it was a bit too wide.</p>

<p>The main problem with Times on letter sized paper is that the measure is too long. And if you make it big, Times is too black. So it never looks quite right in a single column on letter sized paper.</p>
<p>It can work very well in small sizes and shorter measures, which is what it was originally designed for.</p>
<p>To make a single column setting look good on letter sized paper you need a wider font than Times and bigger than usual margins, so that you bring the measure down to near the recommended 2 1/2 lc alphabet lengths.</p>

Taking a little bit of the leading and the margins will only improve it as well without upsetting anyone. However, keep in mind that few teachers actually look at the design of the paper, so your arguments, evidence and use of language are perhaps more worthy of your time in this case.</p>
<p>From my own teaching and grading experience, the Times &amp; double spacing rule is still a lot better than what most students (not design) come up with on their own. I think few teachers would actually mind typography that&rsquo;s an improvement over the standard rules, but what many students come up with just makes for even worse reading. Arial is not meant for 15 page-essays, and a sufficiently poor printer will make a poorly readable mess out of MT Garamond any day.</p>

<p>. . . as will an offset press running 2400 dpi with a direct-to-plate plate. Monotype made other compromises with it&rsquo;s Garamond in the digital version. The ascenders &amp; descenders are too short; the italic needs some absent ligatures (gy, zy, etc.) All fixable (if you bought it long enough ago to have an old EULA). Maybe that&rsquo;s part of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; requirement.</p>

If not, my advice would be to use whichever font you find easiset to read and more importantly proof your work (maybe a well hinted screen-optimised font like Verdana or Arial), then print two copies, one in you favorite print font for your own records and one reformatted in Times.</div>

<p>That depends on how you define non-conformist. If a student turned in a paper in Zapf Chancery - or frankly, even Arial - I&rsquo;d probably send them back to reprint it in a more eye-friendly font. I don&rsquo;t think you want to distract the prof from your writing by using a funky font or &ldquo;non-conformist&rdquo; design. If they notice the font at all, you probably have a problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Goodness. I just realized that if this question comes up here, it is likely for a design major.I like TNR more than most folks on the forum, but I think if I got such an uninspired layout from someone, I&rsquo;d dock points just for using defaults.</p>
<p>Several years ago, &ldquo;Someone I know&rdquo; wrote three essays on an identical subject, with approximately the same length, similar citations, and equal time and effort put into the mildly different outlines, drafts and finals. To complete the appearance of multiple authors, each was set differently. There was no printed style guidelines. One was TNR, one was Garamond, and the last was Verdana.</p>
<p>The deceit was never noticed by the teacher. The grades and comments were as follows:</p>
<p>Times New Roman: A &ldquo;Excellent notes&rdquo;
Garamond(?): A &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo;
Verdana: B+ &ldquo;Hard 2 read - use a regular font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I read that fadtastic.net article last week, it reminded me of those results back in Intro to Ethics.

<p>Amid all the offset-printed (and even laser-printed) digital Times, I actually love to see letterpress-printed metal Times these days. Especially the Monotype (?) version, without the silly nonkerning &ldquo;f&rdquo; of the Linotype.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moral. Get FontLab, or something simliar, &amp; see what you can do.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In principle, I fully support this approach (because I see font &ldquo;tuning&rdquo; as part of the typographer&rsquo;s job). But wouldn&rsquo;t there be the danger of losing the presumably good hinting of Times New Roman? This might really matter in laser-printed school papers. Or does it only make a difference on-screen? And is just the TrueType version of Times New  Roman that has really good hinting? Anyone? I know very little about hinting.</p>

<p>Some universities here in Finland prescribe Palatino, which would be better in this sense (though, for some reason, I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of it).</p>

<p>As to how old &ndash; a number of our Monotype fonts were issued as PostScript Type 3 fonts. I don&rsquo;t really remember how long ago that was, but I don&rsquo;t think MGaramond  was one of those. Still, we got it about that time. We also have a bunch of fonts issued on 5-inch floppys . . .</p>
<p>As to hinting . . . Well, FontLab auto hint seems to work pretty well. Back when the only decent program font editing program was Fontographer, we found it messed up the hinting, so I always generated fonts without any hinting at all. Worked fine for bookwork, where the output was 1,000dpi or higher on repro paper. We did notice that if anybody put a snippet of the book on the web, it looked pretty bad. When I started working in FontLab, the snippets that wound up on the web looked a lot better.</p>
<p>FontLab is an expensive program for a student, but if you&rsquo;re a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> student, I don&rsquo;t see how you can get along without it. I don&rsquo;t mean just font designers, but anyone having to design using type.</p>

<p>However, once, in my &ldquo;Technical Writing Class&rdquo; (aka the cure for insomnia) I turned in the first draft of my formal report project &ndash; which was all about improving the design of one of our major publications, and dumping the Arial currently used &ndash; and for the report, I used the font (Parable) I was proposing for the redesign.

<p>I do have FontLab (and Fontographer). I am a beginner, but so far, I haven&rsquo;t really noticed any difference between the original and FontLab-modified (autohinted) OpenType PS fonts, when printed on my not-so-good Brother laser. (But I haven&rsquo;t really done a systematic comparison.) I just sort of assumed that it might be different with really good hand-edited TT hinting.</p>
<p>As to the MT EULA: so they have changed it, disallowing modification, at some point? If so, I could envision trying to buy the old versions off someone, in case the EULA allows the licence to be transferred &hellip;</p>

I am sure your class  was taught by a lifelong technical editor. Some of those guys are notorious for sticking by anything resembling a rule. I think the worst of them dissallow anything unless you can you prove you have a printed rule which specifially says what you are doing is correct in the eyes of all things holy and secular in the world. I am surprised they did not mandate 10 pitch typewriter double spaced on 25% rag content watermarked bond.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking as someone who sets paper assignments himself, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&ndash;as Thomas (above) may have been thinking&ndash;most instructors who specify fonts in the directions are trying to avoid students using Comic Sans or Copperplate Gothic to write a 10-page paper, and that most of those instructors in turn don&rsquo;t care if they ask for TNR and get Garamond, or Palatino/Bookman Antiqua, or Georgia.

<p>I really tried to recall last night when posting, but could not. This was around 1998-1999, If there was a TrueType pack-in in any of Photoshop, Office or CorelDraw (5?), that would have been what was used.</p>
<p>I wold have to say that Maurice has described the status quo rather well. Unfortunately, there are more than a few overly-anal teachers out there, who will dock for non-TNR, but this is countered by the fact that they can&rsquo;t tell it from Georgia.

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those teachers that required my students to use a specific typeface for their papers. At first it was a point size requirement &ndash; when I was still a student. But then the students found typefaces which were huge at 12 pt &ndash; I&rsquo;m even guilty of this. So when I became a teacher &ndash; as mean as this sounds &ndash; I gave the students margins, point size, typeface and linespacing requirements.</p>

<p>My wife is working on her second degree in the medical field and she last year handed a paper in twice because it wasn&rsquo;t printed in the right font, that was more out of her own fear, but the teacher never commented either way, she actually lost the correct one and handed back the &lsquo;incorrect&rsquo; one.</p>
<p>But speaking of TNR use at 12pts. This past month we&rsquo;ve been dealing with a client that insists their annual report be set like that. They actually complained about it not being set in TNR to begin with. Some people have no sense for aesthetics.</p>

<p>However, what it boiled down to was us taking copious notes on which point size, aligned where, caps or not, bold or not, all hastily sketched on the blackboard&hellip; If you deviated, it was <em>wrong</em> but then, he graded &ldquo;holistically&rdquo;, so nothing was ever actually wrong, it was just not the way &ldquo;people often do it&rdquo; &ndash; which was code for do it this way or die an ugly, painful death. It was near impossible to figure out how he arrived at a grade, because the answer was invariably &ldquo;I grade based on the whole of the work&rdquo;, but he could never point to specific examples of error, only cases of &ldquo;it can be done this way, but I prefer the other&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Apologies for the rant. Guess I&rsquo;m still bitter&hellip; Folks like him shouldn&rsquo;t be teaching. He could have drawn up a sample document, labelled with all of the pertinent info, and handed that out to us&ndash;and I would have gotten <em>something</em> useful out of the course. Bah humbug.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a designer, teacher, and publisher from a primarily English Lit background (I teach publication design, Creative Writing and English Lit), my scholarly experience (both as an undergrad and graduate student) and literary experience (as a writer, editor, publisher &amp; teacher) have brought the default 12pt/TNR/double-spaced into play on a variety of fronts.</p>
<p>As has been discussed here, word-count is a factor primarily because it is asking too much of general Arts students (non-designers) to understand things such as x-height and metrics, and in the end it becomes too much trouble for the instructor to explain for the 1000th time why this font or that isn&rsquo;t appropriate, or how to use the word-count feature in Word, etc., so many instructors simply default to the 12pt/TNR/double-spaced &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for the sake of their own sanity.</p>
<p>Technical font issues are another factor that general Arts students can not be expected to grasp; that is, explaining that setting an essay in Adobe Garamond doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if the paper is being submitted electronically and the recipient doesn&rsquo;t have Adobe Garamond installed on their system. PDF is the obvious solution, but unless the student is on a fairly current Mac, it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;re going to have Acrobat Pro installed.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important, from the reader&rsquo;s position (teacher/editor/etc.), is the attempt at visual annonymity and &ldquo;fair play.&rdquo; We all know, as designers, that what the text looks like will influence how it is received, but this depends on the aesthetics and training of the writer, or lack thereof. As someone who is to judge the success of a text (essay, etc.), attempts by students at visual style simply tend to create an uneven playing field (uneven in the sense that it almost always hurts the student more than it helps).</p>
<p>Relating to publishing, many editors I know absolutely insist on the 12pt/TNR/double-spaced default not only because it fits into their formula for estimating extent (should they chose to publish a given manuscript), but also because they want and need to focus on the content exclusively. If the text is accepted, the typescript will be handed off to a designer (hopefully), so design (at the evaluation stage) simply distracts.</p>
<p>As an editor of a small press myself, however, I encourage submitting writers to format their manuscripts how they think fitting, because I&rsquo;m looking for writers who are aware of the effect typography/design has on the reception of texts. Most of the time this results in horrendous looking submissions, but, frankly, this makes my job easier as an editor when evaluating submissions: if the thing is mired in visual and typographic cliche, then I can be fairly certain that the writer hasn&rsquo;t had enough exposure to well made books to know what makes a well made book. Which means they don&rsquo;t read enough. And if they don&rsquo;t read enough, I seriously doubt their writing is going to appeal to me or stand up to editorial scrutiny.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a teacher of English Lit, I need to keep the field as level as possible, because it is not part of the equation to judge first and second year students on their lack of aesthetic sophistication. Attempts at visual style, even the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->option<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to make such attempts, at this level, generally puts the student in a position of weakness which they have little chance of overcoming. The technical requirements alone are beyond most undergraduate students, let alone any real awareness of typographic convention or principle. Thus, what results are painful attempts at novelty as a desperate grasp for attention, and in such cases what tends to happen is that the essay not only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> weak, but this influence infects the content as well.</p>
<p>That said, I always hope for, and from time to time receive, papers from students who are in-tune (and brave) enough to format their papers in a different font that is well-suited both technically (x-height, characters-per-line, etc.) and visually (tone), and, to my mind, such students are to be rewarded, just as students who go beyond expectations in terms of research should be rewarded. Such considerations should not be built into the assignment guidelines, for the reasons above, but students who take the initiative (and risk) to stand out (by actually improving the quality of their essay/paper/submission) deserve, I think, recongition and thus a higher mark.</p>

:) good idea. but you really are not a shirker. The teachers are teaching we hope.</p>
<p>What you couldn&rsquo;t do is use 14 pt, or 6 pt. of anything. The idea is that non-typographically inclined students will use Times@12 and typographically inclined students, like for example, yourself, will choose a &ldquo;suitable alternative of approximately the same size and length&rdquo; but more &ldquo;stylistically to your liking/peronality. Then the teachers know who&rsquo;s who by the font, or they don&rsquo;t. For any teacher who doesn&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s being taught there, for example, punishing a good font selection of approximately the same size and length for not being Times@12, please don&rsquo;t.</p>

In some fields of study, this is untrue. I mean, <em>very</em> untrue.
The APA guidelines specifically require either a monospace font like Courier or its equivalent, or Times or its equivalent. No exceptions.
They will even balk if the margins aren&rsquo;t exactly 1 inch.</p>
<p>There does seem to be some wiggle room on point size. The guidelines suggest 11pt but 12pt seems to raise no eyebrows and is easier to read onscreen.</p>

Character count/ word count is a piece of cake these days.  Are not these stipulations ways of assuring uniformity for the University? No one ever concerned themselves about it when all there was was a typewriter to key the manuscript. I do feel that people in the visual fields (design,typography, etc..) should have the option of &ldquo;designing&rdquo; the thesis instead of just keying in the text since demonstration of their skills is part of the whole point of their studies.  I don&rsquo;t think the typical engineering student or liberal arts major really cares about the typeface as much as we do here.</div>

I set a paper on the Odyssey in Minion so I could use the matching Greek for quotations; I wrote a paper on i.t.a. set in a digital version of Pitman&rsquo;s i.t.a. type so I could include examples; and when I did an analysis of Beowulf I decided to incorporate some quotes in the original Anglo-Saxon orthography — partly because I thought them relevant, and partly so I could use the digital Beowulf font (based on the manuscript lettering; not &ldquo;Beowolf&rdquo;). I routinely set my papers in Minion; my teacher never noticed. I figured it was sort of my right, as she typed all her assignments and rubrics in Monotype Corsiva, artificially slanted, ALL CAPS.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to second that (as said engineering student). Then again, I proudly admit that I&rsquo;ve never ever followed any ugly requirements, and it has never hurt my marks. In fact, I would like to believe that it usually improves them.</p>
<p>What I really don&rsquo;t understand is the 1-inch-margins requirement.

		<div class="commentbody">School papers, as submitted for grading to professors, don&rsquo;t really need to look good, they just need to be easy to read and easy for the professor to make notes on. The whole layout of things is intended solely for those purposes. Personally, I think that even Times is a bit fancy for the purpose. A font like Courier is, in my mind, superior because it doesn&rsquo;t even PRETEND to be publication quality, but instead presents something so plain that the contents really are everything.</div>

<p>do you have any evidence either of them use courier today?</p>

<p>because i would be very interested in seeing that evidence.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll have to admit that I think it&rsquo;s a good thing that the pages of the Washington Post aren&rsquo;t set in Courier.</p>
<p>I know that when I went to University, even though we had gotten a laser printer in, they hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to installing software to allow people to print with proportional spacing on it yet. So it was early for them to be changing their thesis requirements from &ldquo;a 10-pitch typewriter face&rdquo; to Times Roman.</p>
<p>Note that they also didn&rsquo;t expect their students to all run out and buy Selectrics. Even though many of them, by that time, might have had 8-bit computers, not all of them would have been able to afford a daisywheel printer. (Pocket calculators started coming out in my second year&hellip;)</p>
<p>Visually, 12-point Times Roman - especially when it&rsquo;s really 10 1/2 point Times Roman, or thereabouts, as seems to be the case on computers these days - is considerably smaller than Courier. I&rsquo;m surprised, therefore, that 16-point Times Roman with 1 1/2 line spacing isn&rsquo;t what is specified, to match the old standard.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I have to say you are completely right. Caring about typography is a huge distraction from the writing process, which is why the things like LaTex where invented in the first place, plus the mathematical support.</p>
<p>If you say, people care to much, make wrong choices &ldquo;even if what they chose was pure ßhit&rdquo;. Well, I for one would be happy already if not TNR would be the standard &ldquo;bundled and required&rdquo; serif font in this world, but Times Ten. Let us see if everybody will write with Cambria in 15 years from now.</p>
<p>I do not think it is pretentious to want to write a text in a font that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> strain the eye as much as TNR, after all a display typeface for above 14pt.</p>

<p>I should have known better than to feed the Troll.</p>
<p>OK, one time only:</p>
<p>In the old days of Watergate time, reporters, writers, editors did not CHOOSE a typeface. They just typed words into a machine called a typewriter which had only one font, a TYPEWRITER font.  Their job was words, not the appearance of the words in print. Even later, past &ldquo;The Presidents Men&rdquo; era, with the advent of word processing systems communicating with printing technology systems totally in the background, their was NO font choice.  They were just dumb terminals that collected ascii text and sent it along first to editors,then to automated compositors, then to out-put then to press.  The Terminals used by reporters, writers, and editors had a VERY crude, by today&rsquo;s standards, display, as I recall, it was somewhere between 16 and 32 pixels resolution of a mono-width bitmap font with no choice of size change or width change let alone the dream of a typeface selection. Some were green pixels blasting out of a darker background with all the fuzz and halo glare you could ask from an early CRT firing photons up into your eyeballs.  Some had an orangey-brown background but all were over-phosphored day-glo putrid and a drudge to read. These guys were called WORDSMITHS for a reason.  They only thought, wrote, edited, collaborated, and saw WORDS (and as minimally readable as you could imagine).</p>
<p>I understand and forgive you because you are young and never had to work in such arcane times and conditions. You only know WYSIWYG proportional, beautiful, hinted and meticulously displayed text on hi-rez full color greyscale flat-screen Hi-Def digital real typefaces that any idiot can choose from thousands and display however thay damn well feel like they should&ndash;even if what they chose was pure ßhit.</p>
<p>My point is that WRITERS were WRITERS and whatever happened after they plunked that funny typewriter key and smacked a fuzzy dark smudge on a piece of paper was not their choice, or even on their mind.  The minute their deadline for copy to the editor was done, the next deadline for the next day&rsquo;s story began.  My guess is they were out having a few beers while their stories were being typeset in the composing room by the trade union guys who had to retype every letter over again.
There really was &ldquo;division of Labor&rdquo; then, for good or for bad. And nobody even considered typefaces who was not actually “in the biz”.</p>
<p>Here is a real photo of the actual Woodward and Bernstein while writing the story:</p>

<p>Here is a photo of one of the actual pages of their story with their own notes. Notice the red borders to aid in wordcount for copyfitting purposes:</p>
