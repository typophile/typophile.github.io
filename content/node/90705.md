  in West Virginia:\r\n\r\nhttp://db.tt/nod1nwOX\r\n\r\nI love the typography on the
  face. It's vaguely architectural, and has an almost Scandinavian quality (appropriate
  for an XC ski lodge). I have no idea how old it is, but I'd guess it's at least
  40-50 years old, maybe more. The typography looks handwritten, with a thicker stroke
  near intersecting lines. And I love the triangular zeros! Finally, the thermometer
  was made in the US.\r\n\r\nI have no clue if this is an actual font or a one-of-a-kind
  hand lettering job. If anyone has any ideas, please post up!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nScott"

    ways that would make no sense in running text but fit their initial and final
    positions here. And, the crossbars of the two /E/s are at different heights. '

  body: "Nice find. In fact it sort of reminds me of something a friend of mine is
    working on. Not sure why. Perhaps it\u2019s the curves that look like they are
    carved in wood.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex_4082.png]\r\n\r\nBtw,
    if this is lettering it\u2019s wrong to call it typography. Typography is \u201Cwriting
    with <em>precomposed</em> letters\u201D. "

  body: "Thanks for the replies, and I stand corrected on lettering vs. typography.
    I also noticed similarities with P22's Arts & Crafts font, particularly with characters
    like the /R/. Of course the differences are in the triangular zeros, the eight,
    and other characters that adopt the triangular shape. I'd love to create a font
    from this, but I'm not a type designer. Anyone else care to tackle it? :-)\r\n\r\nScott"
