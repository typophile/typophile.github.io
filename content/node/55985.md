  body: "No, the blurb just assumes prospective speakers know that ATypI, like TypeCon,
    does not cover travel or hotels for speakers. That probably needs to be spelled
    out.  \r\n\r\nYou could always look to sponsorship \u2013 maybe your publisher
    or a patron - to support the trip.  "

  body: "Of course sii is right. I meant only for the first part of David\u2019s comment:
    \u201Cinfo about trip and accomodation\u201D. That info will be in the Atypi site
    at the right moment.\r\n\r\nWhat I can tell you, David, is this: today, one US
    dollar can buy 15 Mexican pesos. So, if someone has dollars, he can buy more things
    in Mexico now than last year (in 2008, one US dollar = 10 Mexican pesos). So,
    in a sense, maybe it is easier-cheaper do the trip than in the recent past.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, if you don\u2019t have dollars but a currency that, as Mexican peso, has
    lost his value, that is a problem. :S\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope to see a lot of you
    people here in Mexico."

  body: "I don\u2019t want to start an ideological or sociological debate, but I am
    afraid this issue will NOT be over until the remote day when drugs become legal.
    Unfortunately, Mexican government don\u2019t think like this (or US government,
    for that matter), so this dangerous situation will be with us Mexican people for
    a loooong time.\r\n\r\nHowever, although this is very hard in some places (mostly
    northern cities like Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\xE1rez or Culiac\xE1n), I was born and
    live in Mexico City and I can tell you that here we don\u2019t have this kind
    of problem (yet?), so it\u2019s not an issue to be worried during the congress,
    if that is your concern. Actually, downtown, in which Typ09 will take place, is
    one of the safest and most beautiful neighborhoods in the city (the so-called
    Historic Center).\r\n\r\nIn addition, you may visit some other incredible places
    near from here: I strongly recommend Puebla and, a little further, Oaxaca (southern
    city).\r\n\r\nI hope someone in the Mexican Secretary of Tourism is reading this\u2026
    ;-)"
