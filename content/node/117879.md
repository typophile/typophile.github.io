  Not sure why I don't know this one...\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erspi_covereng_web500_6113.jpg]"

    to match any of his output. \r\n\r\nThen, I discovered this: http://usshop.gestalten.com/hello-erik.html\r\n\r\nThe
    font is called Real, and was designed by Spiekermann specifically for this project.
    You get it free when you buy the book."

  body: Real is Spiekermann's redesign of beloved Akzidenz Grotesk in one weight only
    especially for this book. Very readable.
