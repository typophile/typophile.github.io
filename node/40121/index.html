  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings, all. 

I just discovered typophile today while attempting to discover which font would best meet a particular design need I've run into. What a cool site. 

Question:

I'm resetting a pamphlet published in 1883: William Smith on Mormonism. 

It was printed in Lamoni, Iowa (at Herald Steam Book and Job Office), as I said, in 1883. 

While I have access to the text, I have been unable to locate any images of the actual document. 

Without that, I have no idea what font was actually used. While I'd love to know, I'd settle for at least setting it in a historically-tenable font.

Does anyone have suggestions?

Much thanks for your time and help, folks. 

Chris

		<div class="commentbody">While it is from a slightly earlier time, Monticello would be appropriate, and better, I think, than Walbaum or Bodoni for the time, place, & content.

Matthew Carter made the PostScript version of Monticello for Princeton University Press, as it had been used in their Thoreau series. This was done in partnership with Linotype as they had done some preliminary digitization.

The fonts are available from Carter & Cone, or I believe Linotype. The C&C has all the goodies, but as it is a Type 1 font, they're spread out across multiple fonts. Monticello is essentially the same as <cite>Oxford</cite>, and could be thought of as a Scotch.</div>

I agree that while DeVinne is nice, it is too light for most applications; yet another casualty of the early digitization era.

I would imagine Font Bureau's FB Scotch is nice, but I haven't seen it anywhere other than their pdf specimen sheet.

		<div class="commentbody">I want to thank you each for your very helpful suggestions. And thanks for the link to the 1800's Emphemera page, jupiter. 

I'm mulling over my options. 

To thicken the plot, I tracked down a couple of scanned pages from an acquaintance in Hawaii. He's now uploaded them to his website. For whatever interest it might hold, the links are:

http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/BroBill/1883-02.jpg
http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/BroBill/1883-03.jpg

I'm going to post these to the Type ID forum and hope for the best. At least then I'll know the identity of the font(s) to which I don't have access. 

The body-text font doesn't seem *particularly* distinctive, at least in my fairly-uninformed opinion, other than the upper-case "J." But the title-font surely must be identifiable from a mile away if one has the right set of eyes. 

Again, thanks much for the help.

& don't get too bothered if a face hasn't got small caps. They were not that common at the time, and I bet the guys down in Lamoni did not have them. Few Midwest country printing shops had them even by the 1960s, I can tell you that from experience.

& Monticello for sure; look at that.

But also make sure you have asked yourself how important it is that the job be set in a "historically-tenable font." I don't mean you should set it in just anything, but think about the purpose of your work. And the audience for your work.

Indeed. I sure overlooked that. Thanks. 

Oldstyle #7 is a Linotype face. Credited to the Bruce Foundry, 1902. I don't have reference material here so cannot check more. Adobe sells it, and until just now looking at MyFonts I had never known that Bitstream has something called Bruce Old Style that is very similar, but appears to be lighter.

I rarely use Oldstyle #7, but there are times when it is just right.

I am currently writing a biography of William Smith and thought you might want to know that the pamphlet is online at

http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1883Wilm.htm

It was transcribed by Dale Broadhurst in Hawai'i.  Dale may have a complete copy of the original pamphlet so you can see the font.  He does reproduce the jacket cover above, in case you don't have that.  He's a really nice guy and can be reached at dbroadhu@hawaiiantel.net

I'd love to get a copy when you're done!

What is your interest in William Smith, btw?
