body: Hi. I&#39;m looking for fabric samples or a good catalog of same &#40;or other
  good examples of ethnic decoration&#41; for swirling patterns similar to what Kris
  Sowersby uses in his <a href="http://www.klim.co.nz/content/type_reader.html">Klim
  </a> logo. Any suggestions?

  body: I know this seems overly general, but I am having a hard time finding good
    high-resolution black and white patterns; I&#39;ve been poring through books on
    Russian and Indian textile design all week and still have yet to find anything
    that offers good reproductions of original drawings for such work.

    can scan your own or are simply looking for inspiration: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4u7r5"

    the textiles are produced for ideas for my own illustration but finished textiles

  body: Yo Josh, <BR> <BR>I got mine &#40;albeit modified&#41; from a Pepin Press
    Resource book, &#34;Signs &amp; Symbols&#34;. You will have seen them around,
    typically square format. All images in the book are included on a cd with hi-res
    bitmaps, but no vectors. I have acouple of the Dover editions as well, and they
    are full of goodies!
