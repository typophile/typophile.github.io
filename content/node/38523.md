  Please comment on the typeface \"Polo\" , I am currently working on. As the name
  suggests, its inspired from Polo mint shape. Please comment, so that I can improve
  upon and learn from your comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nTypomaniac\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo1_4819.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo2_5949.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo3_3664.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo4_5615.jpg]"

  body: "The first thing I'd do here is take a look at what similar work exists. Here's
    one example:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/240634/itcbauhausbyadobe-family.html\r\nNote
    how curves extend slightly below the baseline. As you print out your designs and
    critique them yourself, notice how some glyphs appear to dwarf others when placed
    next to one another, for example your o and i. Also note how horizontal lines
    of the same thickness as vertical appear heavier. Above all, make sure it makes
    sense to you, you can see it on paper, and you understand why you're changing
    something before you take someone's advice and do it."

  body: 'I agree that this looks too much like Bauhaus.  However, the last image,
    with just numbers, is great!  I would redesign your lowercase based on what you''ve
    done with the numbers.  Keep only the S and the backwards-S/upside-down-E character,
    and see what new lowercase shapes you can come up with. '
