  body: Not sure about the MAINE bit. It'd be cool if you could post another screengrab
    where this isn't half covered by a tooltip.

  body: "I added some of the history of Dakota just now to that thread Nina linked.
    Basically,  Dakota is from the old ClickArt Handwritten Fonts collection from
    about 1995. My own printing was in that same collection as the font \"Bowfin\"
    (a.k.a. Marions Hand).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
