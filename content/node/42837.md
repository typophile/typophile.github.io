  i need your help though.\r\n\r\nI need to find type specimens, and preferably a
  lot of them.\r\n\r\nDo you know any nice type specimen websites?\r\n\r\nSo far i've
  only found some websites with really old specimens. I need to find some more recent
  ones. Like from the 60s to now.\r\n\r\nThanks."
