  Mac PostScript Type 1 format.\r\n\r\nAnd none of the current family members are
  named Plain, Italic, Bold or Bold Italic.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing this discussed
  here before and the process just seemed ridiculously complicated.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody
  have a link to those earlier discussions?\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nAlso...
  the whole process of generating type one and suitcases used to be so simple using
  Fontographer years ago.\r\n\r\nIs that still the case with the new updated Fontographer?\r\n\r\nOr
  have things just become that much more complicated across the board now?"

    (page 312)? Seems like all the necessary info is there. \r\n\r\nI think the only
    thing you can't do with FontLab is put more than the basic four-font family into
    one suitcase. But I'm pretty sure that Family builder couldn't do that either.
    To do that in the olden days I used the Finder, which let you open suitcases as
    if they were folders and move fonts in and out of them. Not possible anymore with
    the OS X Finder, unfortunately."

  body: "Mark~\r\n\r\nThat suitcase section of the manual makes my head spin. \r\n\r\nAnd
    it doesn't come out and say that any suitcase can now only contain 4 fonts.\r\n\r\nSo,
    if my family has 12 members... I will need three separate suitcases. With all
    the naming conventions and Fond IDs and ATR compatible stuff set up properly.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorry for whining... but dang this all seems SO complicated!!!\r\n\r\nBut I will
    buckle down and read through everything three or four more times and try and make
    sense of it... \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: "Technically, you could make a Mac font family with up to 48 styles with Family
    Builder, but that was only because Outline, Shadow, Condensed, and Extended were
    available besides Italic and Bold. Practically no fonts were shipped with anything
    but families comprised of the basic four-font scheme (R/I/B/BI). So you still
    had to break multi-weight families into subfamilies back then.\r\n\r\nBuilding
    Mac Type 1 fonts isn't really any different now, it's just that FontLab is designed
    for so many more possibilities."

    pose? I have a number of older families which are packed into single suitcases,
    and breaking them up into smaller suitcases is a royal pain now that Classic is
    dead.\r\n\r\nI haven't encountered any problems with them yet, but would like
    to know what potential problems it might pose to leave them that way.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
