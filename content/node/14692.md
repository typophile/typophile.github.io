  \r\nAnyway, this may be very broad but I am looking for a beautiful serif \r\ntypeface
  for a paragraphs of type. Something classic, that looks nice at \r\nand can read
  at a very small size. \r\n\r\nI have a variety of old letterpressed books and they
  always seem to use \r\na classic serif. Any suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks."

    _\r\nThe higher optical sizes have classic elegance, while the lower sizes maintain
    good readability at smaller point sizes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
