  we're working for. The designers who did the logo are out of business, so we're
  having a hard time tracking down the font used... I even ran it through MyFonts.com's
  WhatTheFont, but to no avail...\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have a clue what typeface this
  might be?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_6742.gif]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBard"
