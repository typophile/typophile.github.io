  once.  The lowercase a was distinctive in that it had a straight crossbar above
  the counter, and no curl at the bottom right.\r\n\r\nI've edited the a of Akkurat
  to give you a better idea, and it does come very close to what I once saw.\r\n\r\nthanks
  for the help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3959.jpg]"

  body: Forgot to mention the straight crossbar did have an inclination as shown in
    the example.
