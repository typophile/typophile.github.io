  body: I found also other pages, and they use more characters, so it's probably like
    you said "A" is the signature, and "iii" are lowercase roman numbers for the leafs.
    Thanks for your help.

  body: "A iii ist the Signature.\r\n\r\nA signature consists almost always of a letter
    (or a combination of letters) and a numbering in lc roman numbers. Its function
    is \r\n\r\na) to help the book-binder to fold the printed sheet into a quire (and
    so to ensure the correct sequence of the leaves of a quire) \u2013 hence the numbers\r\n\r\nb)
    to help the binder to arrange the folded quires in the correct sequence in the
    order of the alphabet\u2013 hence the letters\r\n\r\nand so to arrange the whole
    book in the required order even if the binder was not able to read or understand
    the text. This was necessary because in early prints pagination was almost unknown
    and so many books were missbound. (Books from the 15th to 18th century were usually
    sold as unbound sheets and binding was left to the buyer).\r\n\r\n\r\nWolfgang\r\n"

  body: "Signature marks, also called collation marks, such as the one shown above
    persisted in a variety of forms even into the early 20th century. As mechanization
    increased they became rarer.\r\n\r\nIf you work in the book production racket
    these days, you will be familiar with the current form of signature marks. If
    you look at a pile of F&Gs (folded and gathered signatures), you'll see black
    marks printed on the fold of each signature, stepping down the spine in order.
    As each book's signatures are gathered, these marks should always be in the same
    order. If they are out of order, an \"electronic eye\" sees this and shuts down
    the binding line. As recently as ten years ago, it was till regrettably common
    to find the occasional book with sigs out of order, or with two of the same sig,
    or with missing sigs. That has become far less common thanks to this system.\r\n\r\nThese
    new marks perform the same function as the collation marks shown in the first
    post and explained above by Wolfgang.\r\n\r\npowers"
