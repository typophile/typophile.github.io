body: Hey I was wondering if you fine people could recommend any good graphic design
  agencies in Los Angeles. I'm looking for some cool places to approach and talk to
  while I'm in LA later this year. All kinds of good places would be appreciated both
  boutique studios, large branding agencies as well as large advertising agencies.
  I would really appreciate any help I can get here

    could also go through the faculty listing for the three\r\nmajor design schools
    (ArtCenter, Otis, CalArts) to find stuff.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
