body: "Hey guys, \r\n\r\nI recently finished a display font. It is called rund which
  is Swedish for round.\r\nIt is based on 12 circles laid out on a 3x4 grid.\r\n\r\nIt
  comes with a PDF poster that follows a similar 3-column grid, with the main copy
  laid out as the 3x4 grid used for the font. The color scheme is based on hue increments
  of 30, going from 0 to 360, thus completing the whole color wheel/circle. \r\n\r\nIt
  is downloadable for free from my site  [[http://www.andersorrberg.com/index.php?/personal/rund---display-font/|
  | you can get it here]]\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\nHope you enjoy it.\r\n/Anders\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rund_1_5483.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rund_2_4129.jpg]"

  body: "It has some interesting shapes. I like the flow of the characters. The z,
    q & x mess with me, but I see no other alternatives considering the constraints
    of the design. My biggest problem is, from a sign design stand point, that it
    is too weak. It would get lost in the negative space from any distance at all.
    Still looks cool.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nYeah, some problems can't be avoided, following
    the constraints of the grid.\r\n\r\nYou're right, it wouldn't work on a sign,
    it wasn't really intended to do that either though. It might be a bit too weak
    in general but I quite liked it being so thin. I have been considering making
    a few other weights though, which would extend the possible areas where it could
    be used.\r\n\r\nIt works best in printed media and in fairly large point size
    on screen.\r\n\r\n/A"
