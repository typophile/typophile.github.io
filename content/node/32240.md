  002_3820.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe great game of Ice Hockey is played on a Rink internationally
  that is 30 meters wide by 60 meters long. In North America the rink size is approximately
  200 feet long by 85 feet wide. Older rinks like the old Boston Garden were smaller
  and not consistent between buildings. This makes the international rink wider by
  approximately 15 feet. \r\n\r\nThese narrow NA rinks make for a more congested ice
  surface. The international surface makes for a more exciting game and for the player
  it provides more room for an attacking style of play. "

  body: "well I brought this autograph to school and a bunch of other kids tried writing
    and all they got back was a photocopy of the same photo. Mine was more real and
    probably signed by an admin or something since his signature sometimes looks different.
    I also have had to work on my signature since I've had a few students ask for
    it. I can't just sign it like you would for a cheque.\r\n\r\nOh, just saw and
    ad on NASN (north american sports network by setanta sports) that Boston is playing
    Montreal on Tuesday!!! yay... \r\n\r\nI've recently had my front tooth redone,
    and noticed my three scars don't show up as bad as they use too. "
