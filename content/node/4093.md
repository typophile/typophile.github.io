  an very simple concept and I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if there is something
  very similiar around &#40;I didn&#39;t want to get to far into it if so&#41;. I&#39;m
  enjoying it so far, but what do you think? I&#39;ve been thinking I would make it

  body: ' I knew I couldn&#39;t have too much hope of not seeing this already done.
    Though, from the smallish previews of Extra that I could find I do think that
    I&#39;ve got some substancial differences. Like mainly I&#39;ve stuck to the block
    more on certain characters &#40;J, L, T, and especially I&#41; which was something
    of a debate for me as the original concept was blocks with only the smallest of
    cuts to make them ledgible &#40;and wasn&#39;t too worried about ledigbility at
    that&#41;, but obviously more traditional character widths/cuts could be good
    for those characters. But maybe now I&#39;ll just stick to the block for better
    or worse. <BR> <BR>hrant, your :-&#40;  I&#39;m translating as '

    FF Extra  does everything  <BR>that Chub Rock does, and does it better. <BR> <BR><A

    is a better showing of Extra Black</A>. <BR> <BR>Your J, L, T, I, and S <I>do</I>
    differ, but Extra&#39;s  <BR>solutions for these glyphs are more clear. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure the remaining difference &#40;the <BR>straight edges&#41; is enough to
    warrant a new <BR>font of this sort of novelty. <BR> <BR>Sorry to poop on your

    feel too glum spending some time on it.

  body: ' I&#39;m actually not sure which is better/worse, and I don&#39;t want to
    discourage you. As long as you know what else is out there, and you make your
    own thing &#40;mostly&#41; independently, and the process turns you on, that&#39;s
    plenty. Hopefully it will turn other people on too, and maybe you could sell it
    better than FF? &#40;Although that would be hard.&#41; Type history is littered
    with plagiarism but also coincidental similarities. For example there&#39;s a
    part in Alexander Lawson&#39;s incomprable &#34;Anatomy...&#34; where Zapf expresses
    surprise at the similarity of Optima to a much older design by Middleton - but
    compare how the two designs fared on the street. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Although it is similar, and in some ways very similar, I also think it can
    be seen as very different. I prefer the rigidity in Mitchell&#39;s. And if I really
    wanted a &#34;phat&#34; face with more roundness, I would use font bureau&#39;s
    <A HREF="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1039728523390289&amp;fontname=Asphalt"
    TARGET="_blank"> Asphalt</A>. <BR> <BR>The character&#39;s with any kind of counter-like
    space &#40;or counter&#41; seem to be a different weight than the others. That
    would be one critique from this corner. i&#39;m not sure i like final solution
    for you &#39;J&#39; either. The idea is nice but the solution isn&#39;t completed.
    :/ <BR> <BR>All in all, I do like it ... but, Hrant and Stephen&#39;s points &#40;perhaps&#41;
    shouldn&#39;t be ignored. See this as a challenge Mitchell and make it your own!
    Go Team!
