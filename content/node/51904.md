  in London and we're taking on new magazines by the bucketload at the moment. We're
  about to start initial designs for an A5 travel publication, and I'm looking at
  headlines and complimenting body copy. I'm thinking sans serifs for both, although
  I'm not averse to having a secondary headline font which we can mix and match.\r\n\r\nThe
  client has specified they like clean, smooth, smart, modern fonts, they have been
  impressed with some other publications of ours that use Bliss and Franklin Gothic.
  I'm a big fan of Din but am finding it difficult to match a body copy or a secondary
  serif headline.\r\n\r\nWe've got a large library of fonts that have already been
  purchased, but the list is a bit out of date. if anyone can recommend some old classics
  or sources of any freebies/trial downloads, feel free!\r\n\r\nIf you want to see
  some of our work, visit [[http://www.absolutepublishing.com|our website]]. The site
  isn't up to much visually, but the printed work is nice!\r\n\r\nLook forward to
  your thoughts!\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "boicozine,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we're not looking for freelancers, at the
    moment, sorry! \r\n\r\nThanks for these suggestions guys, I do like a few of these.
    Purchasing fonts isn't something I've done a lot of... \r\n\r\nDo you guys know
    if libraries are willing to let you 'try out' some of these before buying? I've
    got to persuade my own editors before we even get as far as the client, so some
    testing might be in order...\r\n\r\nOtherwise, any more classics I might be able
    to dig out of my library?"

    Sans]] might fit the bill, but the 500 and 500 italic are free. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/|Museo]]
    (perhaps for headlines?) even has three free weights."
