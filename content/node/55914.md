  body: "I think \"Angel Delight\" looks custom, although it may be a custom font.
    [The small lettering is FF Cocon, but not 'fluffy' and 'light', which seems to
    be a third style, similar to Frankfurter].\r\n\r\nAs for alternatives, if you
    want the halo effect in the lower bowl of the g from Angel, how about Canada Type's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/orotund/|Orotund]]. It's a better contrast
    with the other two typefaces used in the ad, as now they seem too similar to each
    other.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
