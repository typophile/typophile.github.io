  code Opentype features. \r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html
  \r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/thread/395648\r\n\r\nWhile these two links were invaluable,
  we've got a simple snippet of code that is confusing when trying to sub many to
  one. The thinking was to swap out certain typed words with a single \"word\" glyph
  using more efficient coding than the letter at a time method Thomas described in
  his link. \r\n\r\n<code>feature calt {\r\n<em>sub t' e' s' t' by test.word;</em>\r\n}
  calt;</code>\r\n\r\nThe code below usually works fine except in the case that the
  word is immediately repeated. Then it appears to \"oscillate\" and only substitutes
  every other sequence of letters. Note that this happens whether a space is used
  or not to separate the repeating letter sequence. Our question is Why?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_6326.png]\r\n\r\n"

    see you actually doing any contextual substitution), a plain <code>liga</code>
    should work just fine:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub t e s t by test.word;\r\n}
    liga;\r\n</pre>"

    completely overlooked the obvious.

  body: "Andy, probably this didn't work because 'calt' expects some context:\r\n\r\n<cite>A
    Chain Substitution rule target sequence has three parts: backtrack, input, and
    lookahead glyph sequences. A glyph sequence comprises one or more glyphs or glyph
    classes.</cite>\r\n\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f\">5.f.

    File Specs)\r\n\r\nIt appears to me you are replacing everything, always. Khaled
    is right, these are ligatures."

  body: "Using ligature would be right choice in this case, but this doesn't explain
    why contextual substitution didn't work. \r\n\r\nHaving empty backtrack and lookaheasequenceses
    should be perfectly valid. In fact, empty contexts are used to implement 'ignore'
    keyword in AFDKO syntax or EXCEPT in VOLT.\r\n\r\nIf you have access to computer
    with Windows installed, you can try the same font and text in Notepad and see
    if it works there."
