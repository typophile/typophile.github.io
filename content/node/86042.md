  body: "Close to VIALOG, but not quite. x-height on lowercase is higher, I believe
    than Vialog. Also, tail on 'g' is closer or tighter to the bottom part of the
    'o' part of the letter 'g'.\r\n\r\n(But it's much closer than 'Amplitude').\r\n\r\n"

  body: It reminds me of Erik Spiekermann's former corporate typeface for Nokia, but
    it's not that. It does seem familiar though... hm
