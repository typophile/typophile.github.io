  composed & distributed a periodical called 'Typo'. I've seen them in the flesh,
  they're utterly fascinating. Amongst other things, he was receiving type specimens
  from all the important international foundries, which was seemingly unusual for
  the time. What's even more interesting is that he reviewed the new typefaces with
  honesty & wit. The good news is that the whole lot has been digitised & is available
  online. \r\n\r\nThis is the <a href=\"http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-SheTypo.html\">introduction
  by Sydney Shep</a>, this is the table of contents for all <a href=\"http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-corpus-typo.html\">11
  volumes</a>. \r\n\r\nHave a poke around. There's bound to be something in there
  of interest. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the intro:\r\n\r\n\"Typo. A Monthly Newspaper and
  Literary Review [1887-1897] is a landmark in New Zealand printing and publishing,
  famous in its time, then forgotten, and now re-discovered. In addition to a wealth
  of information ranging from the latest domestic and international news about printing
  and the allied book trades, Typo includes book reviews such as Julius Vogel\u2019s
  Anno Domini or Women\u2019s Destiny , tipped in specimens featuring a full-colour
  cover design for Edward Tregear\u2019s Potona, or Unknown New Zealand , and articles
  about the latest developments in phonography, stenography, universal language, and
  \u201CKaliografi.\u201D This periodical is an example of a worldwide phenomenon
  of the nineteenth century, the typographical journal. What sets it apart, however,
  is the attention paid to its visual display. The series of articles entitled \xAB
  Design in Typography \xBB are both singularly important and astute contributions
  to the international dialogue about aesthetics and offer clear and concise instructions
  to the practical printer.\"\r\n\r\nAbout Robert:\r\n\r\n\"Robert Coupland Harding.
  has often been portrayed as New Zealand\u2019s most accomplished typographer and
  printer, but today he remains virtually unknown. Historically resting in the shadow
  of William Colenso (1811-1899) who is famous for printing the Bible in Maori and
  the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand\u2019s founding document, Harding\u2019s story
  is a compelling example of technical virtuosity overlaid with pointed critical acumen,
  quiet self-possession punctuated by determined professionalism. From 1887-1897,
  he singled-handedly wrote, composed, printed and internationally distributed Typo.
  A Monthly Newspaper and Literary Review. This journal represents the pinnacle of
  a career devoted to the world of visible language.\"\r\n\r\n "

    series on ribbons and scrolls is my favorite bit so far.

    Wondering because the sans serif could be from the same source that inspired <a

    to be an account of the ATF Self-Spacing Type in the publication, as well as a
    series of articles on type measurement before the point system.

  body: "Indeed, they were appropriately cautious when they noted in the article at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Har08Typo-t1-g1-t1-body-d1.html\r\n\r\nthat
    by the year 2000 foundry type might no longer be in use. On the other hand, they
    were over-optimistic about the march of progress when they speculated that English
    spelling would be reformed by then as well.\r\n\r\nAnd while printing houses may
    be without types, they are not without presses or ink - even though laser printers
    do make that sort of thing possible, it is not usually the most economical way
    to proceed."

  body: Mind-boggling, isn't it? We sit here at our keyboards and smart phones, typing
    our thoughts, and seconds later it's been composed into pages and published worldwide
    for hundreds or thousands (well, maybe dozens) to read. Talk about movable type.
    Those guys had no idea.

    attempts at punctuation reform that were attempted by creative typographers over
    the years. The article (book?) specifically mentioned question marks, but gave
    the interobang as an example.\r\n\r\nThis definitely caught my eye, although mostly
    by engendering confusion:) \r\n\r\n(I like it more than the damn smiley, especially

    to have it - and they actually can use it mid-sentence on individual words! Same
