    kind of persecution complex? I'm not being nasty, but I think you should seek
    help.

    that the owners of Typophile have been highly negligent for way too long, and
    you're worried they're going in and removing your threads?\r\n\r\nAs an aside,
    \ I think you need to lower your expectations of empathy from near-total-strangers.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ;)\r\n\r\nIf you put yourself in the position of the owner of this Punchcut gig
    then the Typophile website thing becomes rather entertaining in its entirety.
    The current rendition of the website, the resignation of Moderators, the constant
    spam, the endless stream of website improvement/changes suggestions, add to all
    of that Punchcut's website update posts (are there any???) on their own website
    ...LOL!\r\n\r\nI think the good folks over at Punchcut have a much different POV
    :)! You hrant and the rest of us are nothing more than digital bacteria in a digital
    petri dish.\r\n\r\nNow that's a POV that I can appreciate.\r\n\r\nn."

    but I do want to clarify that I myself don't have a major problem with them (considering
    Typophile is sill much more valuable than any other type site out there, and it's
    free) but it certainly seems true -as things stand- that they wouldn't be spending
    the time scouring the many daily threads for moderately problematic trivia.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    all of us are peons in a much, much broader way than merely some type forum.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    an issue at the high level of complexity, then figure that, clearly, I must be
    nuts, which I suppose is a valid point of view if you have a small mind\u2026which,
    unfortunately, most people do. Me, I'm kind of a big picture kind of guy who thinks,
    perhaps naively, that there are VERY FEW which are, strictly speaking, impossible.
    What if? Why the hell not?\r\n\r\nA radical new approach to font marketing? A
    uniform, enforceable system of Digital Rights Management? A Global Internet Currency?
    A system which will revolutionize heating and cooling, and lower energy costs
    by 75% or more? World Peace? All doable, IMHO\u2026"

    is NOT traded on any currency exchange, and hence is not subject to fluctuation
    nor speculation and IS NOT the U.S. dollar. Given that virtually every currency
    in the world is fiat currency, all it would take is some bold soul to proclaim,\u201CLet
    there be One Trillion Simoleons (or whatever), and there would be.\r\n\r\nGoogle
    \u201Cvehicle currency\u201D; global interest sales OUTSIDE the U.S. are projected
    to hit ONE TRILLION DOLLARS this year; effectively managed (automatically, at
    point-of-sale. just like a Digital Rights Mangement system), the Chancellor of
    the Exchequer could levy a 1% transaction fee on both buyer and seller (bye-bye,
    PayPal; hello, $20 billion). For coming up with this brilliant scheme, I ought
    to be able to collect a measly one percent of THAT two percent\u2014or $200 million
    a year, give or take. If you wish, you may call me Your Worship.\r\n\r\nBut that's
