  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings Fellow Font Designers!

For the last several years, there has been a growing and disturbing trend online, the unauthorized conversion of font designs being resold by individuals on eBay and at personal websites . . .

I have spent a good deal of time contacting many of these folks to have my Font Diner fonts and fonts that the Font Bros represent removed since it directly infringes on the licensing restrictions which include no conversion or resale of derivative works . . .

Needless to say, I have also taken time to research the process as well as what methods can be pursued to convert my faces to sell to these customers of whom 99% are Windows users and most female and over the age of 50. Additionally for those not in the know, 99% of the US embroidery industry exists in the southern United States; North Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Oklahoma, etc . . .

I should back up a moment to educate font designers on the methods of font use in embroidery applications . . .

First of all, there is no Adobe or Apple in the embroidery world but rather a disparate group of manufacturers, suppliers, individuals all home-rolling their own one-off unique solution and for as many embroidery machines as exist, there is a unique application and software for them.

There are two different types of Fonts for embroidery applications:

Scaleable Fonts - Just like we're familiar with, there is an ability to create a scaleable typeable font but it's unique to a specific application and cannot be converted to another application . . . So, it's always dependent on the application . . .

Expanded Alphabets - What happened about 5 years ago is that folks so frustrated with the lack of variety began to simply digitize our fonts as explained above specific to an application, then they generated individual letterforms in specific sizes ranging from 1/2" to 3" tall and selling each collection of letters for $9-$29 each . . . While these aren't really fonts at all, a quick Google search will show it is 99% of what is being sold . . .

The Expanded Alphabet letters work with 100% of all machines and are easily converted at size for size resolution but cannot be typed out but rather are assembled one letter at a time since each letter is basically like an eps image . . . Also, they are only scaleable about 40% either way before the stitches become too hard to work with . . .

While there is software that will automatically generate embroidery font files from fonts, 100% of all the folks I've spoken with insist if it wasn't hand-digitized, it won't stitch properly and the end result will be poor quality . . . Also, without an embroidery machine ($2-$8k) to test these digitizations with, the work cannot just be done solely digitally without testing . . .

So, here lies the challenge . . . The proper way to convert fonts to offer these fonts for sale means that we'd either need to develop a free universal application that allows folks to set type in the application and generate fonts specific to this application, OR we'd need to learn how to hand digitize our fonts or hire digitizers to convert our fonts to suit a format that can generate a library of expanded letterforms that can then be sold . . .

While my post may seem trivial, embroidery font folks are making THOUSANDS of dollars selling our font designs and this I know for a fact!

Even by implementing additional licensing in our EULAs that restrict this act specifically, the fact is this is a growing market and without some unified sense of a solution, our works will continue to fill other folks pockets rather our own . . . And so, I'm making a call to arms to ask for you to give your thoughts and opinions about a potential solution to this issue . . .

At worst if we can become educated about the conversion process, we can then elect to convert our works, at best we can agree there is a suitable forum that can offer the services and support to make this work happen in a manner we can license it . . .

Thanks for your ear and I hope I'm no alone in my concern . . .

Best,
Stuart</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, I know, they're making a mint from our fonts in a market with loads of disposable income: people willing to drop three grand on a sewing machine. It's unlikely that most foundries will start producing their own fonts in these mysterious formats. The ideal situation would be a 3rd party; sort of MyEmbroideryFonts kind of deal. They'd handle the conversion/testing for various formats and font designers would keep a chunk.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That seems to be what it logically is coming to Ray for me as well . . .

As you're quite correct, $3k at minimum for a stitch machine to test the work . . .

Funny thing is, different than font designers as a community, they are all cut-throat since once a font is digitized, it's done so there is lots of vying for exclusivity of the digitizations . . .

I'm currently talking with some folks to find out what sort of arrangement they have in mind . . . I will share it with the group . . .
