  I dons't know if I want a new logo or one that has that concept pushed to a new
  level. \r\n\r\nIf you're curious my website is here: [[http://holymoleephoto.com/]]"

  body: "Hi Chris,\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of \"will-i-won't-I\" with my own logo
    at the moment - and that's my job!\r\n\r\nWhat i'd say, is if you have a lot of
    printed media (ie. business cards, letterheads, brochures, vehicle graphics etc.)
    that use your current logo, i'd suggest on purely a financial level, wait until
    you've got more or less nothing left - then start on a new design.\r\n\r\nI like
    the existing typeface but would maybe consider updating your icon with maybe a
    little more detail - but i understand that the two letters of your business are
    incorporated quite nicely anyway.\r\n\r\nDunno, hope this has been *some* help!!\r\nJeremy

  body: "Thanks jeremy! That has been quite helpful. I haven't really done any of
    the marketing materials. Its been pretty much a slapdash start so far so I haven't
    really anything to lose. \r\n\r\nAt this point i would like more clients as well
    refine the logo and make it more detailed."
