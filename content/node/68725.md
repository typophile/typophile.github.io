body: "This is from an essay by Firmin Didot published in 1783 and set in his Cicero
  italic (12 point) - a text where, supposedly, Firmin shows his mother the peculiarities
  of the typeface. There's an interesting treatment of the lowercase v - when paired
  with a, like in the word \"avez\", it gets a different shape. Like this:\r\n\r\n
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/didot_italic01_5394.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe v in \"vous\"
  is the standard shape; the one in \"avez\" is the contextual glyph, narrower and
  without the left top tail. The reason seems to be having an homogeneous kerning.
  I wonder if other typographers ever applied such a trick. Below is attached the
  full page from the Italic essay.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"In that text, the v in \"vous\" is used only in initial position.\"\r\n\r\nCorrect!
    So in Didot's intention the \"contextual\" lowercase v glyph was probably the
    first letter in a word; indeed, the narrow v is also used in other words:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didot_italic03_6028.jpg]"

    common example.

    as well, but in a more subtle fashion (as with John\u2019s) and focused on the

    contextualized alt l.c. diagonals for specific situations."

  body: "When I was talking to the late Kay Amert, she said that I should look at
    the italics of Simon de Colines because they were full of contextual and alternative
    glyphs.  I have yet to do this but I expect that she is right about this. However
    I will be looking at them quite soon to see if they bear on my work.\r\n\r\nIn
    the meantime here are my contextual v shapes from my not yet released Reading
    MATD type - Arrotino.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/v_4203.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    blue portion at the serifs is the portion contextually removed. The middle one
    has a bit of both sides removed because it has two diagonal neighbors and the
    ones on the left and right just the the side next to a diagonal letter. All the
    diagonals in Arrotino roman have this behaviour when set against a fellow diagonal
    (y, v, w and x). The idea is to be able to present the letter optimally in all
    contexts. The example shown is unlikely to be a final solution for this letter
    as it was put together fairly quickly - more in order to test the code to control
    it than as a matter of highly deliberate letter design. Still, could a little
    thing like that make a difference? I think it can - yes."

  body: That's pretty darn subtle, Eben, to the degree that I wonder whether it might
    be simpler to make these shorter serif v glyphs the default letter and dispense
    with the broader ones altogether. I had a similar thought regarding Rob's Vesper
    alternates, but they are not nearly as subtle as yours.

  body: I'm thinking about doing something a bit like this Didot <em>v</em> in my
    Brill Italic typeface. The style is derived -- more directly than most types --
    from 18th century formal cursive writing, but I'm forced to make a pointed rather
    than a rounded <em>v</em> because the rounded form is a separate letter in IPA
    and some orthographies. My default <em>v</em> is quite similar to the Didot initial
    form, which of course causes spacing or collision problems when following some
    other letters. I probably won't use the variant form after every letter, though,
    only after those in which problems occur.
