  to answer topic. I will give you some information first.\r\n\r\nI am a graphic designer
  much like, I'd imagine, many others on this site. While this is a great job compared
  to almost any other I can think of, it is still not entirely fulfilling. I spend
  a lot of time at home painting, drawing letters and generally tinkering with visual
  forms of self expression. In the long-term it would be nice to have this end of
  things take over.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that when it comes to the design of letterforms
  I am untutored and unsure of how to proceed. Now that I have a wife and young son,
  a return to full-time education is not an option. A large part of my degree was
  spent using letterpress and hand drawing type so I am not coming to this entirely
  fresh.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is this - can anyone recommend books on type design
  or long-distance learning courses, or any other resources such as these that I might
  benefit from? Thank you in advance."
