  into asian fonts.\r\n(i.e. Kozuka Mincho, Adobe Myungjo Std, LiSong Pro, MingLiU\u2026)\r\n\r\nDo
  you know some ressources on the subject? Especially about Adobe Ming Std.\r\nDo
  you know on which western font Ming Std's latin glyphs are based?\r\n\r\nI noticed
  that some of them seem to use stretched (monospace forced) version of Times.\r\nBut
  maybe I have to check the \u201CScotch\u201D style as well?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    embodies this style.\r\n\r\nI believe those were drawn by Asians based on their
    own penmanship manuals showing the Roman style for sign-painting and the like:
    the traditional Chinese almanac (T'ung Shu) has hand-drawn characters in which
    the same design peculiarities can be seen."

  body: "Many Korean serif text typefaces use Latin glyphs in the Century style, often
    with high x-height and squashed descenders to avoid sticking out when used with
    the Korean glyphs. One widely-used text typeface seems to use something based
    on ITC Garamond, presumably because the light glyphs with high x-height apparently
    harmonize well enough with Korean glyphs.\r\n\r\nRather than designing Latin glyphs
    from scratch, makers of Korean text typefaces will typically base their designs
    on existing ones that harmonize well with the Korean glyphs and adjust weight
    and proportions."

    what Cyrillic glyphs included in MS PMincho look like. Their spacing in the font
    is very, very loose and uneven (I have slightly adjusted it for this showing):[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MS_PMincho_Cyr-Sm_5274.gif]<dt>Looks
    like those letter-forms are roughly based on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/37680#comment-231093\">Latinskii</a>,
    a very popular Russian typeface (H.Berthold, 1901), a Cyrillic \u2018extension\u2019
    of Lateinisch (H.Berthold, 1899):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1901_Berthold_Latinskii_Sm_6196.gif]</dt>I
    have problem identifying the design source of the Latin glyphs included in MS
    PMincho:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MS_PMincho_Lat-Sm_6354.gif]"
