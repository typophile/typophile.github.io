body: "Extensis has released an update to Suitcase 11 for Windows (v11.0.1), which
  includes auto-activation plug-ins for InDesign CS 3 as well as Illustrator CS 3.
  The update page is <a href=\"http://www.extensis.com/en/support/updates/suitcasewindows11.0.1.jsp\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nOn
  the Mac side, Suitcase Fusion currently provides a plug-in for Illustrator CS 3,
  but not InDesign CS 3. So, for the first time I can recall, Windows font management
  users are a bit ahead of the Mac side. InDesign CS 3 plug-ins are in development
  for the Mac though. Extensis' CS 3 compatibility page is <a href=\"http://www.extensis.com/en/support/cs3_compatibility.jsp\">here</a>.
