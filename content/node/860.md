    DIN</a>.

  body: I&#39;m not familiar with the ads you mentioned. Is the typeface in the following
    graphic the one you are looking for? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13909.gif"

  body: Do yourself a favor and buy <a href="http://www.fontshop.com" target="_blank">FF
    DIN</a>, not the discordant original.

  body: Thanks for the tip, Joe. If I ever need DIN &#40;maybe when it&#39;s not trendy
    anymore&#41;, I&#39;ll go with the FontFont version.
