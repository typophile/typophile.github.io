  body: "Now I feel I must explain my spontanious first-ever Blog.\r\n\r\nI hate the
    word Blog. It sounds like a cross between Blockage and Clog and the English term
    \"bog\". All of the other scatalogical references that ended up in the haiku made
    me laugh, so I ended up hitting post and vaugly regretting it. I am glad it made
    your emoticon smile. I didn't mean it to be a dis to typophile or a comment on
    anyones posting. So perhaps I will write another. :^)"
