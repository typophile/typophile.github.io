  probably going to look stupid, but ever since I came across this font, its been
  driving me insane trying to figure out what form of helvetica it is and where I
  can find it. I could be wrong; It might just be helvetica, and I'm an idiot, but
  the letters look like they're closer together (especially the T's with the way they
  barely connect).\r\n\r\nIf somebody could help me out, I would seriously appreciate
  it. Thanks."
