  body: 'Yes, it looks like Dolly, which is not surprising as it was designed by the
    folks who designed Dolly. As to how good it is, that must be judged in the context
    of the product it labels, and it''s not a logo for MTV. It is sober, with reminders
    of a long history, but with a contemporary air. All that it does admirably well.
    Its only shortcoming in my eyes is that it could be more elegant, given the look
    of the cars.  '

  body: "I think the one thing that stands out to me is how incredibly balanced it
    is.  The M is squash in the middle, but it doesn't feel forced, even though in
    other fonts it would be slightly to the left.  YOu can see in the background of
    pictures they played with the idea of a stronger M, but in this case it's subtle,
    like a grounding force, sturdy.  Not a bad image to give off.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Frankly, although the lettering is quite lovely, I find it to be a non-identifier.
    \ I don't see it as distinctive enough to act as a logo. It just looks like a
    word set in a traditional looking typeface. The typeface does not seem to suit
    the company, either. It may make a lovely titling face for a book but I can't
    imagine it cast in metal and chrome on a car. If this is a logo, it should be
    more evocative of the company and the products instead of just blending into the
    world of book typography.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Chris, William, it's not a logo for a car. Daimler AG (uses Corporate S typeface)
    is actually parent company that incorporates Mercedes-Benz (uses Corporate A),
    Daimler Trucks, but also Daimler Financial Services (formerly DaimlerChrysler
    bank, using Corporate E). Anyway, as Chris pointed out, it is undistinctive, IMHO
    does not work that well with former elements of identity, and for the money...well,
    quite poor. DaimlerChrysler identity including logo, Corporate typeface trilogy
    and design principles was really great and very sophisticated. This one is not.
    Maybe balanced, sober or whatsoever, but neither beautiful & balanced, nor beautifully
    sober, nor outstanding or memorable.

    they do have the famous three spoked wheel for Mercedes-Benz. Lorem points out
    that this is for more than the cars, so, yes, that is a telling criticism. '

    for luxury anything. The work is very true to the Underware style. It will be
    fun to see what happens to it and how it gets handled.

    that it will be changed within a few years. "

    \r\n\r\nSo, in my head (which is never a safe place) when reading the word I have
    to go back over the last two letters, and DAIMLER becomes DAIMLEP-ER. \r\n\r\nIf
    the intent of the wordmark was impart something along the lines of solid-structured-stylish,
    I think the R's contrasting elements undermine the solid-structured part... and
    unbalance the wordmark.\r\n\r\n"

    sell new products, far from being a motorvehicle, with a new philosophy \u2026\r\n\r\nYou're
    folks getting deep with the typedesign, but i cannot, the wordmark just allows

    S on the signboard. Hehe, and it works really good together with the moustache
