body: "I used to know what font this was, but I deleted it years ago when I realized
  how ugly it was. I have to set up this hideous logo for screen printing, but I have
  not been able to remember what the font was called. \r\n\r\nThe customer refuses
  to let me make something that *gasp* LOOKS BETTER, so I have to match the font in
  the attached image.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated. I can not wait to get
  this pile of nastiness out of the way.\r\n\r\n-Randy[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sj_4804.jpg]"
