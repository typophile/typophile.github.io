  helping me here. I need to find the slab serif font in this flyer - I know, it's
  different weights and compressions here, but it looks like the same font. \r\n\r\nBonus
  points for anyone who knows the script font and that super-compressed art deco-y
  font that's also used.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TAG-Ad-5TJT-2_5503.jpg]"

    design looks very close to <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=House-Industries&ffam=United%20Serif%20Reg%20-%20Bold&fid=388ed3b8ad6c661c4bb600b5c0ee5e8c&fsize=60&text=Bricks%20TAG's%20campus%20building%20expansion&wrap=2|United

    square and not round, otherwise it could be a very good substitute."

    body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI dug a little further and found at least a close match
      in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/quadon/|Quadon Bold]], or maybe
      [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/alianza/|Alianza Slab]]. \r\n\r\nFunnily
      enough, I thought of it as looking like a slab serif version of Eurostile, and
      I did find a font called [[http://www.fontspace.com/synergy-digital-media/sd-eurostile-elite-demo|SD
      Eurostile Elite]], but it seems to be only available in one variation, and the
      site for the original designer (not Aldo Novarese - it's an unofficial thing)
      seems to have vanished."
