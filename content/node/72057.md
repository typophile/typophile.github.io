  body: I checked it out, but alas Alternate Gothic has angled terminals on the "S"
    and also its "G" has a spur.

  body: Ya, this one is heavy on the geometric feel, with an emphasis on parallel
    lines. I'm surprised either that we haven't figured it out yet, or that it's not
    a widely available font. I particularly like this face, although the "K" seems
    maybe a bit off.

  body: "Yes, it's the K that seems to be my problem. Remember, these are manufactured
    letters, so there's no reason they needed to use a font as the basis. However,
    I think <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/\">Gothic
    RR Medium</a> is pretty close, except for that K.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, Mike!\r\n\r\nYa, this sign is probably 25+ years old. Funny how it
    looks so well thought out until the last letter. K can be a funny letter like
    that.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about Gothic RR, and it looks quite useful."
