  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'd like to solicit a few opinions about our name, Apollo 26. I thought it was rather inocuous&hellip;to me, apollo = exploration, 26 = alphabet&hellip; but a fellow type designer who works with T26 today said in an email that Apollo 26 was kinda uncool, in his opinion. I wrote to CS at T26 and he expressed his thoughts in a very direct pleasant manner. <BR> <BR> <BR>So&hellip;Anyone have any thoughts about the number 26? <BR> <BR>would apollo 26 create confusion in the marketplace among type buyers? <BR> <BR>then there's the Apollo Program, elliott earls. <BR> <BR>Arggh!

		<div class="commentbody">BJ, you've hit the nail on the head - both of those names have &quot;industry saturation&quot; in that they both have associations with other foundries. <BR> <BR>To that end, going with that name will decrease your &quot;uniqueness&quot; to the marketplace, especially if you're trying to build your own unique brand. <BR> <BR>Focus on what it is you want to accomplish with your foundry, print out one line showings of all the fonts you've created for commercial sale and look at what you've got. <BR> <BR>In short order, it should become obvious what it is you're really going as a foundry. From there, it's a matter of finding a name that compliments that vision and brings it to another level. <BR> <BR>Also, make the name memorable and easy to remember because one day a few years from today, when somebody mentions your foundry by its contacted name, everybody who reads about it will know exactly what foundry is being referred to. <BR> <BR>(eg: House, Emigre, Font Diner, you get the pocture) <BR> <BR>Whereas if somebody posts, check out the new Apollo fonts, or the new 26 fonts, chances are they won't know it was referring to you. . . <BR> <BR>Just my thoughts . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BJ: I concur totally with what Stuart said, and I think you should wipe the slate clean and rename.  <BR>In naming a font - which I think is a discussion we had here already - it is preferable if the name is evocative. But naming a font/design company I think all bets are off. You don't have to be literal and you might get away with anything. Look at Yahoo!, eBay, Frog, etc. etc. Printing out the one line examples could help, but the stuff between the lines - the business plan inside your head might be the clarifying factor in gelling/choosing a name.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of all the Greek gods, I'd have to say Apollo would be my last choice as a representative for the creative process in general and the typographic arts in particular (even though he's oft depicted as the God of Arts). Sure, he's more than qualified to act as poster god for the Art of Hinting, along with his sister Artemis, but this is only one aspect of the process. (In a similar vein, the 26 letters are only a small sampling of the typographic realm.) <BR> <BR>Imo, as far as greek gods are concerned, some kind of partnership between Hephaistos, Dionysus and Hermes would be a good team. From a practical matter, as far as the general public is concerned anyway, you may as well name your foundry Three Stooges, Inc. If you had to pick just one, the Roman analogue to Dionysus, *Bacchus*, might make for a cool logohead&hellip; Just a thought. <BR> <BR>- Sean</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again Stuart and Mart, Sean John and Andy?. I know this is kind of a silly discussion, blah, blah, pixels for words. But instead of regretting a hasty post, I'll try to embrace it. So&hellip; <BR>We have our first retail release coming later this month, DEFCON, a preview of which will be available late Wednesday. Certainly, I'd like to do the *right* thing, but&hellip;I have a partner who has an opinion, CS has an opinion, probably EE has an opinion, and what is *right*? And how does *that* differ from what is pragmatic? <BR> <BR>Looking back at my computer files, the first record of Apollo 26 is from last November. So it's almost been Nine Months. Hmmm. In nine months, my partner and I have taken on the identity of the name and our work reflects it. We *are* the name and the name *is* us. To us it means exploration, creative freedom, no mo status quo. It's difficult to quantify or qualify, but to us, it's *deep* and *real*. Also, last November, EE was pretty much dormant in the industry. So when the name popped into my head, it wasn't a synthesis of EE or CS or any of that. <BR> <BR>Initially, Apollo 26 was going to be an online magazine to fan my burning passions for type and letterforms, with 26 handy issues, one every two weeks, a mix of design and journalism. I had the themes plotted out, the interview lists ready&hellip;hey Stuart, you were going to be featured in the RETRO-themed issue. The '26' worked three different ways &ndash; the alphabet, the bi-weekly issues, and Apollo 13X2. <BR> <BR>The Apollo 13 mission has personal significance to me, besides being a great moment in *thinking*, it coincided with an important event in my life without which I wouldn't be here: birth. <BR> <BR>On general principle, to me, the number 26 is fair game but A26 is too close. '26' as a number to describe the alphabet (Alphabet 26) or type or fonts is not 'wholly original' to T26, not like Test Pilot Collective is wholly original. And Sean gave us a concise history of Apollo. I can see how people 'in' the industry would get flustered by the name, irritated, or just plain roll their eyes. True, as a 'practical business matter', the name should be changed but sometimes principle is stronger than practical. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the input, <BR> <BR>Get ready for a sneak peek at DEFCON, the first retail release from&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR>bj</div>
