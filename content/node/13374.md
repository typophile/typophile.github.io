  don't forsee any lengthy text settings.  Right now it's just a stationery design
  job.\r\n\r\nAnyone have first-hand experience with the situation?  Any recommendations
  for similarly neoclassical digitizations?  Letterpress experts, I'm looking in your
  direction..."

    it letterpress, considering it's a bit light it should work great, at least at
    the smaller end of your size range.\r\n\r\nBTW, I would love to see the results.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and aesthetically relevant to the client's wishes.  Thanks for the concurrence.\r\n\r\nI'll
    post some macro zoomed digital pics of the final product in a couple weeks most
    likely."

  body: "Silas\r\n\r\nI'd likely want a Baskerville with a bit more character to it
    than ITC New Baskerville, but not so much character that it is a bastardization
    (Mrs Eaves). What about the Storm Type Foundry version? Or the Monotype?\r\n\r\nBut
    yes, you do want something a bit thinner and with a bit more contrast to it if
    you are intending to print this letterpress. Mainly to offset the gain you will
    experience and also because most digital typefaces are drawn a bit heavier than
    their letterpress brethren. This was a tendency inherited from the photocomposition
    years.\r\n\r\nYou can also thin down the face, which I would recommend, with Fontographer
    or FontLab. Otherwise you are going to end up, on the printed page, with a demi-bold
    version.\r\n\r\nGerald"
