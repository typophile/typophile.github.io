  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am very interested in how you genereally think when you are making those specimen PDF sheets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that many foundries include a full character sets in the PDF, and we all know it is possible to break out the font from that. On the other hand maybe it is worth the risk.</p>
<p>I am pending between including all characters (for the buyers sake) to give people the possibility to see all characters and by that I think it is good for buying customers – OR to put up the full character sets on my webpage as pixelbuilt images. And by this let the PDF serve more as inspiration. The negative side of the later is of course that people cant zoom in on the characters etc and get a full picture of the whole font.</p>
<p>How do you all approach this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Better to show people what they&rsquo;re paying for; and make them <em>want</em> to pay instead of pirate, than to try and force them into paying…</p>

<p>I understand, however no hinting is only a real problem if you have very small type in your specimens. Which people will zoom in on. Or they print it out.</p>
<p>If you embed a full font in a PDF, it will <em>always</em> be possible to extract it.</p>

<p>That necessarily doesn’t make piracy of embedded fonts especially relevant from a business standpoint. People who have nothing better to do than extract fonts from PDFs probably aren’t ever going to be customers. At best it prevents people from running programs that download every specimen on a foundry web site, extract the fonts, and create new-but-screwy-versions that get released as large collections. But people do that with flash type testers already.</p>
<p><cite>How do you mean? A password to open the file?
That would defeat the purpose of downloadable PDF specimens, wouldn’t it?</cite></p>
<p>PDF encryption can place different limits on a file. One can encrypt a file that can still be viewed and printed, but not viewed as plaintext, converted to postscript, printed to another PDF, or embedded in other files. Reading the Acrobat manual would be an excellent idea for people outputting PDF specimens.</p>

<p>Seriously though, I agree that the pirates aren&rsquo;t the ones who will be buying your fonts to begin with. Don&rsquo;t let fear run your business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a flattened PDF is a good idea. It is just as bad, maybe worse, that a limited set. I want to be able to zoom in on the letters. In order to make it high res enough for zooming that PDF would become a monster.</p>

<p>PDF-encrypting is of course a must, that I will do no matter what is in the PDF.</p>
<p>If there are even more options on how to encrypt a PDF than giving it a password in InDesign for what is &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; I will definately reap up on that too, didnt know more could be done.</p>
<p>A flattened PDF is not so good in my opinion – it must be the real font, and hinting does more than just give small letters a sharper attitude and push up the overshoots to the alignment zones, so the hinting must definetely be there.</p>
<p>I believe one really should focus on the potential buyers, and not the potential pirates :)</p>

<p>It does not prevent font extraction.</p>
<p>G.S. &ndash; <cite>Outlining is not an option, it doesnt look good on screen.</cite></p>
<p>What about a middle-way? Embed fonts with subsetting. And convert only the glyph overview to outlines. So the embedded/extracted fonts are at least incomplete, in addition to lacking kerning and OT layout tables.
I would think that someone who is interested in a typeface will print some pages. Even the glyph overview converted to outlines should be fine for evaluation with standard high-res printers.</p>

<p>Easy. Two sentences:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For security reasons the characters in this font have been outlined and may appear a bit awkward on screen. For a more faithful reproduction print out the character set on a high-resolution printer&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Problem with that is, what if the whole reason the user wants it is either for use on screen or in PDF? They&rsquo;d have no way of getting a preview of their actual usage.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend embedding the &ldquo;real font.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re really worried about piracy from the PDF, subset it and leave out at least one or two important glyphs.</p>
<p>Obviously we at Adobe are not very worried, as we make and post PDFs showing every glyph in each font we sell. I have no reason to believe that piracy via ripping fonts out of the PDF is a significant portion of all piracy of our fonts. If it were 10% or more, I&rsquo;d start to be concerned about doing things differently. But I have no reason to think it&rsquo;s even 1%. It&rsquo;s just so much easier to get the &ldquo;actual&rdquo; font from pirate sources.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
