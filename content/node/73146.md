body: "Starving Student (no-meals, no big dinner event) rate\r\n\r\nOnly available
  to full-time students\r\n\r\nTo especially appeal to local students with limited
  budgets, we made this cheaper by NOT including: lunches, opening reception, and
  the big dinner out at Guinness. It still includes (non-lunch) snacks and refreshments,
  and the opening keynote. Not to mention the regular talks and conference.\r\n\r\nIf
  you're a full-time student and have already registered, you may downgrade to the
  \"Starving Student\" package by contacting secretariat@atypi.org.\r\n\r\n- 5 days
  full conference: $270 or\r\n- 3 days main conference: $170 or\r\n- 2 days PreFace:
  $150\r\n\r\nCheck it out at: \r\nhttp://www.atypi.org/03_Dublin/70_register\r\n\r\nThese
  rates are less than half the \"late registration\" rate currently in effect for
  students/associates. See the registration page for details.\r\n"

    \"I can't get to Copenhagen because of the 9/11 attacks, refund of my conference
    fee\". But hey its only been a few years."
