  of doing it on an iPad. Has anyone tried using iPad for writing? Any good editor
  apps available (<a href=www.ommwriter.com/>OmmWriter</a>-ish)?\r\n\r\nMy concern
  is if it is at all possible to overcome the inconvenience of not having the cursor
  navigation keys.With the type of text I have to write the going back and forth through
  the text and editing, deleting and moving words and blocks of text is a norm. Doing
  this by poking the text area with a finger does seem to be productive.    "

  body: You can use a Bluetooth keyboard with it. The on-screen keyboard works fine
    for things like participating in discussions on Typophile, and I have heard of
    people typing over 50 words a minute with it.

  body: "Ok, so I give the iA Writer a try. 452 words so far and the overall impression
    -- passable. \r\n\r\nTwo biggest issues with it so far \r\n\r\n(a) It sometimes
    gets sluggish, by a fraction of a second, but it is noticeable and it is annoying.
    I would type - tap, tap, tap, tap and it would go - click, click, click, pause,
    click. This also causes auto-corrections sneak in when the pause happens right
    before the space is hit.\r\n\r\n(b) In a portrait mode the keys are too small
    and it is fairly inconvenient to hold iPad on a lap and type (while sitting in
    the armchair). Latter leads to a strange posture, which will probably give me
    some odd sore muscles tomorrow, and former causes me frequently hist spacebar
    instead of the keys in the bottom row. That in turn seems to cause the staggering
    from (a) and needing to go back and retype the whole word. And there is no way
    to backspace the whole word at once, so it is a hassle.\r\n\r\nIn a landscape
    mode things are better, but the usable space where the actual typing occurs becomes
    too small and so it's easy to loose the context. All in all though, the landscape
    mode is a way to go.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPositioning the cursor with a finger tap
    worked out to be not a big issue. The font size is big, so it is easy to hit the
    right position. Plus they also made the cursor jump to the side of the word when
    tapping on a word - this is a very nice touch.\r\n\r\nIn short -- not ideal, but
    it is $1.99 well spent."

  body: "It might be worth mentioning, I do have a Bluetooth keyboard and paired it
    with my iPad when I first got it. Works great. However, after about a month or
    so, I realized I never used it. I stopped bringing it with me and eventually un-paired
    it so it could be used for something else. \r\n\r\nIn general, if I have something
    substantial to type, I don't do it on the iPad. For the typing I <em>do</em> do
    on the iPad, the landscape view virtual keyboard is fine. I only use the portrait
    view keyboard when I'm too lazy to switch to landscape view just to type in a
    password or something short.\r\n\r\nThat said, a Bluetooth keyboard is the best
    option if you intend to do more than a little typing in portrait mode."

  body: "I wouldn't recommend the dock keyboard. Clever, but a one trick pony. You
    can't use it with the iPad in landscape orientation, for example.\r\n\r\nOne nice
    thing about using a Bluetooth keyboard with the iPad is that the arrow keys and
    a lot of common keyboard shortcuts (such as the ones for copy, paste, undo, select
    all) work, which is not true of the virtual keyboard. Plus, the virtual keyboard
    disappears when you're using a physical one, giving you the full screen for your
    document."

  body: "There are pros and cons to the dock. Some pros include that you can charge
    your iPad while typing, which you generally can't do if you just stand your iPad
    in portrait orientation. (Of course not everyone wants to type in that orientation.)
    Also it's very stable, and has some special function keys which a bluetooth keyboard
    doesn't have. \r\n\r\nBut there are some cons, too, including that it only works
    in one orientation, and you must remove your iPad from its case.\r\n\r\nHere is
    Macworld's review which compared the dock to a bluetooth keyboard:\r\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/150600/2010/04/ipadwhichkeyboard.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: Do you have the official iPad case that Apple sells?  I found that the slope
    it gives really helps out a lot if you're trying to type in landscape.  Harder
    to type when it's laying flap.
