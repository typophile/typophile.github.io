  typeface used for 'pure'. Whatthefont could not identify it so I wonder if skilled
  humans could fare better? I'd say it has some Emigre-quality to it, but I could
  not recognize it among their fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n/p\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC06028_5307.JPG]"

    we fare better, and how. You're talking about the most efficient type identification
    team in the known universe here. ;^) :)D"
