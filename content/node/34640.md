  a distributor on its personal behalf or by the way of its own registred company,
  if there is one? \r\n\u2022 If the company is chosen, are the royalties are transferable
  with his personal name if one dissolves or if the company is sold?\r\n"

    they end up on the URW++  font list and they will not pay me any royalties. I
    stopped making fonts 12 years ago because of the ease of pirating. My company
    was called Facsimile Fonts\r\nand produced many fonts now in public domain."

    you need some legal advice on this, Frank Martinez will be at TypeCon:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/35216\r\nYou
    may also find some folk who would be interested in helping develop a classic like

    has changed a lot in 12 years, due to the Internet."

  body: "As I understand it, the new way is to form your own foundry, launch a website,
    but refer all customers to MyFonts, which will pay you 65% of each sale but give
    you visibility you could not possibly achieve on your own. Yes, you could sell
    directly from your website (see joshuadarden.com, a perfect example) but marketing
    and visibility count for as much as typeface merit.\r\n\r\nMake full use of OpenType's
    advantages; be sure text faces have oldstyle figures for each font; be sure text
    families are released with at least two weights and matching italics, never leaving
    out bold italic; and be sure to keystroke-link all fonts the way the big foundries
    do. "
