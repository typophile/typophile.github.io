  the viewing of threads. Writing posts, viewing the forum index etc looks fine. Has
  been like this for a week or two and wasn't before.\r\n\r\nChrome, Windows 7. \r\n\r\nWorks
  fine on Firefox.\r\n\r\nScreenshot is here: [[http://photos.moniker42.com/photos/i-Gmm7NFM/0/X2/i-Gmm7NFM-X2.png]]"

  body: Same here. I'm living with it broken, it's not that bad and kind of ironically
    fun in a place teeming with webfont enthusiasts.
