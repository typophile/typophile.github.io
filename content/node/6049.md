  body: speaking as a layperson i think most average joes &#40;at least here in the
    states&#41; associate &#34;European&#34; with the clean, cool, modern Swiss and
    Scandinavian styles. <BR> <BR><i>coz im asked to design some types that trend
    to the European style</i> <BR>i guess you really should ask your client what he/she
    thinks &#34;European&#34; means. probe him/her for a bit more iformation than
    just &#34;European style&#34;

  body: 'Don&#39;t be such Modernists, guys. Lynn&#39;s question is... <i>real</i>.
    It doesn&#39;t have a answer like &#34;1 &#43; 1 = 2&#34; but there&#39;s a fuzzy
    reality there, and if we think objectively and pragmatically, we can help. She&#39;s
    probably looking for trends, not The Answer. <BR> <BR>Look at the fonts in tipoGrafica
    #60. As a group, they&#39;re turn-of-the-century &#40;I mean this last one&#41;
    South American. Look at the stuff in FontFont: as a group, they&#39;re very European.
    Look at Emigre: they&#39;re highly Californian. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s somewhat hard
    to imagine FF Signa for example being designed outside of Northern Europe. Yes,
    it&#39;s not impossible, but the <i>trend</i> is there. Otherwise we wouldn&#39;t
    have differences in culture around the globe. And it would be hard to imagine
    some of Martinez Meave&#39;s fonts being designed outside even <i>Mexico</i>,
    not even the broader Latin America. And then look at Franklin Gothic, then look
    at Univers. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be afraid of tangible -if hazy- variance. To paraphrase
    Jerome Peignot: let&#39;s celebrate our differences. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

- body: I usually feel awkward when these discussions appear because they tend to
    go all stereotypical when it comes to what a country &#39;is&#39; and what it
    represents. Has anyone an idea of what goes on in Scandinavia?  <BR>Have you visited
    the design schools graduate shows? And compared it to what happens in London,
    Paris, Tokyo or Ulaanbaatar for that matter?  <BR>  <BR>If you did... You&#39;d
    be surprised. <BR> <BR>And Hrant, would you elaborate the north european aspects
    of FF Signa?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious. You usually have an interesting way of
    presenting your ideas, although from reading several of your posts I suspect you&#39;re
    actually a closet modernist...  ; &#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Tankard&#39;s Bliss strikes me as very British &#40;yes, I know he is British&#41;.
    It could be that it is because I see a little Gill Sans in there. <BR>

  body: Fredrik, it certainly is &#34;dangerous&#34;. And if I try to nail down why
    Signa looks Northern European, I would probably have to resort to formal descriptions,
    and maybe that goes against the &#34;atmospheric&#34; point of all this? Dunno.
    <BR> <BR>Feelings are subjective, unreliable, etc. but they&#39;re also <i>real</i>.
    And it makes sense to me that groups of people who share things &#40;like a country&#41;
    would often express themselves in certain patterns. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

- body: '<i>On the other hand...</i> <BR>If a typeface is widely exposed, during a
    long time &#40;like Johnstons London Underground&#41; you might feel it becomes
    part of a city, or a country. <BR>Bliss, yes I do feel it&#39;s english typographic
    roots, but I also feel it&#39;s a bit swedish beacuse it&#39;s frequently used
    by the biggest mobile operator in the country &#40;maybe Scandinavia as well,
    it&#39;s Telia&#41;. <BR> <BR>When i see FF Signa I see something danish, actually.  <BR>Because
    of danish type tradition, from Knud V Engelhardt to DSB &#40;Danish State Railways&#41;
    corporate identity and typeface, designed by danish design agency Kontrapunkt.
    And the DSB type is displayed everywhere you travel &#40;in Denmark&#41;.  <BR>So
    there&#39;s a style associated with Denmark, but I wonder, how close is a country&#39;s
    <i>visual</i> identity to it&#39;s soul? If countries have souls, that is. Or
    a whole bunch together like Europe for that matter.  <BR>I&#39;m sceptical...  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll end this post as I noticed Alessandro did on another thread with
    a verse from a song.  <BR>From <i>Cold Swedish Winter</i> by Jens Lekman: <BR>
    <BR><i>When people think of Sweden i think they get the wrong idea, <BR>Like Cliff
    Richard who thought it was just porn and gonorrhea; <BR>and Lou Reed said in the
    film</i> Blue in the face <BR><i>that compared to New York City Sweden was a scary
    place. <BR>They seemed to have a point after meeting with this girl... <BR>maybe
    not Cliff Richard, but Lou had surely met her.</i> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: I&#39;m so in love with the DSB typeface. I cannot imagine it coming from
    anywhere else, it&#39;s so close to DK&#39;s soul. <BR>I touched on designing
    for a country&#39;s soul in an earlier post. it might be relavant Lynn.

  body: Mea culpa. I can&#39;t keep up with you youngsters and the zillion computer
    faces you refer to. When I was setting type on Berthold equipment, I thought that
    their Concorde was a very classy face with a European flavor. Any of the Gill
    family say the London Tube stations and markings. Akzidenz Grotesk and Microgramma
    are other sans serifs. Clarendon and C. Bold were very common in Switzerland,
    though it&#39;s American in style. Hope this helps. <BR>PG <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"
