    of odd ligatures, including the 'it' in 'Little', although offhand I didn't notice
    the 'wn' ligature in the FontBook showing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I see that the 'w' in Mrs Eaves is the wrong style (no middle serif), so
    I think they used Alita for all of it. I agree the wn must have been customized.\r\n\r\n-

    was rather weird - Adobe Kozuka Mincho, but now I see you're 100% right. Thanks
    a million."
