  body: The PHONAK sans looks quite generic. It is probably <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/frutiger_87_condensed_extra_black/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=96&sample_text=PHONAK&ft=liga&acs_pt=32">Frutiger
    Condensed Extra Black</a> or could at any rate be replaced by it without anybody
    noticing.
