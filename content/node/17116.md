  body: "I think you could re-create this using the Nick's Font you found and Jim
    Spiece's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/\"
    target=\"new\">Quaint Gothic</a>, which would only need some serifs removed from
    the A, N and R. With a bit of clipping of Nick's G, I think you'd have it.\r\n\r\nBottom
    line: Carolina Golf could be a customized mix of these two fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "So it does! Good spot (once again) Mike.  Even better than knowing how to
    fake a font, is knowing where the actual font can be found. \r\n\r\n<em>There
    must be a principle like Ockham's Razor when it comes to fonts too -- the simplest
    explanation is almost always the right one.</em>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
