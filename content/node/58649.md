    cool old wood type specimen books on the <a href=\"http://www.unicorngraphics.com/wood%20type%20museum.asp\">Wood
    Type Museum</a>. Or is this not what you mean?"

  body: "Amazon, Alibris, Abebooks and Ebay. Be aware that it can be hard to win the
    ebay auctions unless you use auction sniping software to automatically bid only
    in the final moments before an auction ends. Ebay prices tend to be much lower
    than the used book dealers because the used book world is full of vendors who
    have ample shelf space and will price a these books at three times (literally)
    what it will sell for on ebay in hopes that a someone who doesn\u2019t know better
    will fall for it. Some of them are available on Google Books, but because PDF
    readers are not optimized for dealing with a long series of images they\u2019re
    rather hard to use."

    some day, and for general inspiration.\r\nJames, can you point to some available
    on Google Books?\r\n"

    Archive.</a>\r\n\r\nResolution is not really high enough for making revivals maybe,
    but it's not too bad for just browsing. The files are enormous and make make my
    (not particularly recent) macbook pro very sluggish and hot but I think it's definitely
    worth it, I mean, for those of us without monstrous collections of printed versions
    or access to particularly extensive library collections..."
