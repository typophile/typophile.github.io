  body: I walked past a small sign in off the street with this on it today just off
    the Clerkenwell Road , London - how coincidental. The sign looked like it had
    been there since the 50s but had the condor logo stuck in the corner. Would have
    taken a picture if I had brought a camera with me!

  body: "At first I thought it might be something in between Compacta and Compacta
    Black, skewed, but that doesn't seem quite right. If you're looking to recreate
    it, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-911/swiss-911/|Swiss 911]]
    seems to come pretty close, this is what I got manually fitting it to your logo
    and skewing it in Photoshop (bearing in mind I don't own this font, so I transformed
    a MyFonts screenshot):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/condor_5411.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the absence of any better answers, will that do? I wish I recognised it, but I
    really don't."

    decals for the frame - hopefully not too many attempts (finger prints, tears,
    air bubbles etc !)\r\n\r\nMany thanks once again"
