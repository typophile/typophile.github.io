    with the alternates?

  body: "There was a <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script02Pg6.html\">Mecanorma
    version of Poppl-Exquisit</a>, which is shown here in samples from my Script Font
    ID Guide. These samples were sent to me. You can see the Italic has the letters
    in question, i believe. I am not sure that you can still find this for sale anywhere
    that still has Mecanorma fonts, but I had an actual copy of the font files, so
    I know they existed in digital form.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
