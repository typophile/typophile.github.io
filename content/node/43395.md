    Halftone) but here am showing how to do it in the Photoshop.\r\n\r\nCreate a big
    black dot on a transparent layer with a white background\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3732.jpg]\r\napply
    gaussian blur to the dot layer\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4943.jpg]\r\nNow
    merge all the layers(Ctrl+Shift+E) and apply halftone effect with following details.\r\n(Filter/Pixelate/Color
    Halftone)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4023.jpg]\r\nThen you can take
    this image to Illustrator and apply live trace filter to get a verctor output.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_5183.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    you want - repeat applications to the effect seem to widen it.'
