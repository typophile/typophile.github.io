  body: "Amazing feedback! thank you so much.  While I tend to agree that it is most
    likely handwritten, their website has other words using the same font.  I settled
    for Manus and Snotnose in the end.  Not sure where I can get a trial of Snotnose
    though - more searching to be done :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks!!"
