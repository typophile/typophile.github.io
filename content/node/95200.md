  pointing will be helpful."

  body: "There are many tubies with typographic content. However, these are all more
    or less experimental exercises, not tutorial ones, I gather.\r\nWhat is it exactly
    what you\u2019d like to learn? To design brochures or books? Websites? Shopfronts
    \u2026 ??\r\nI am not aware of any video tutorials covering this.\r\nMaybe, for
    the first step, you stick to more conventional means and consider going to a library
    \u2026 or a course.\r\n\r\nHowever, as it happens I did a [[http://www.schlossgoseck.org/index.php?id=82&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=69&cHash=91bb0927e5b84f3ec9c0f35c317a1c76|short
    video on lettering]] just recently. If that is of any interest to you."

  body: Another thought -- if you launch iTunes and go to iTunesU (university) you
    can find lots of free videos of college course lectures. Don't know if they have
    any on typography, but it might be worth looking.

  body: "I just plugged this site in another discussion, but I'll do it again here
    -- Lynda.com has about 1,500 professionally-made video tutorials on design topics.
    \ I did a quick search for typography courses and found several, including a 7-hour
    video course on \"Choosing and Using Web Fonts\", a 6.5 hour video course on \"Typography
    for Web Designers\", and a number of tutorials on using type in specific applications,
    such as InDesign, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator, and so forth.  \r\n\r\nThe
    site is mainly focused on \"how-to\" videos; I don't think they have much in the
    way of type history or theory, although perhaps they do and I just overlooked
    them.\r\n\r\nYou have to pay a monthly fee to access their videos, but they do
    have some free samples, and a Google search will often turn up a discount code
    for a free month or at least a discount.\r\n\r\n"

    a knife and a ink pad.
