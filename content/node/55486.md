  body: "This is more of a general suggestion: I highly recommend checking out the
    <a href=\"http://www.sitebits.com/2007/paris-bouquinistes.html\">bouquinistes</a>'
    book stands next to the Seine. They sell lots of old and out-of-print books \u2013
    you might be able to find some type related stuff there as well. Last time I was
    in Paris, I found a gorgeous, out-of-print (afaik) book about embroidery alphabets
    there, and it was pretty cheap too."

  body: "i am surprised to see the bord de seine's bouquinistes considered \"cheap\",
    though they are indeed a good source. for modern typographic stuff, you might
    also take a look at \"artazart\" on the canal saint martin (and plus, the area
    is very nice to stroll around), and the library at centre pompidou - lots of choice,
    but quite pricey. for the old typo books, i have no idea. i get mine from the
    net.\r\n\r\ndr\r\n\r\n"

  body: David, the few old/out-of-print books I have gotten from bouquinistes seemed
    reasonably priced. Dunno, I'd suspect the people who sell those books won't be
    equally savvy about all of the more specialized books they sell, and type, for
    one, might just be an obscure enough area to make for some good deals?
