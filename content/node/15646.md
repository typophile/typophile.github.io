    there's another font, a really cheesy one where all the letters are\r\nquite close
    to the horseshoe shape, but I'm forgetting what it's called..."

    body: Tks... but not quite (Studzs).  I'm designing a logo for a friend that raises
      "Caballos de Paso".  I need a more "serious" ("formal")font.  I have draw a
      tipical "Poncho" and Hat of a "Chalan", and I want to place his initials in
      the center of the poncho with a horseshoe shaped font.

    Well, I guess one day I will run into it again (in fact there's a senior-citizen
    van company around here, called \"Caravan\" I think, that uses it) and I'll report
    back...  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
