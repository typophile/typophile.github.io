  slow at work. I would appreciate any advice on how to tighten the whole thing up.
  I realize that the kerning is abysmal, I think I should get the characters working
  first though. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m trying to accomplish is a typeface that is instantly
  recognizable as a typewriter font, but at the same time is &#39;cute&#39;. I don&#39;t
  know why I&#39;m compelled to do this, but lately I&#39;ve been obsessed with typewriter
  typefaces. <BR> <BR>I feel the uppercase T and Z are pretty weak, but am uncertain
  how to tie them in better while still retaining a little cuteness &#40;or maybe
  this is the problem - they shouldn&#39;t be cute&#41;. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: 'The idea of a softened typewriter face is interesting. I would study Goudy&#39;s
    faces, including Goudy sans, as he was the master of the softer look without getting
    overly cute.  <BR> <BR>I think the stem of the m, n should rise higher, and the
    i j be taller. They looked squashed below the x height. '

  body: 'Well, the typeface is now named - I decided to call it Babbage. Here are
    some samples of it in a more complete state, with the T and Z worked out. <BR>
    <BR>Originally I had the stem on the m and n higher, but it disrupted the flow
    of the words when reading it, it seemed too jarring, hence the lower version that
    you now see. Thanks for the suggestion, though. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: babbage-11404.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*10.3*Babbage+%2d+a+more+finished+version+of+the+typeface*babbage%2eswf

  body: Corey - There&#39;s definitely room for more cute typefaces. <BR> <BR>In the
    world of toys/cartoons, there&#39;s way too much Fontesque <BR>and Countryhouse
    going on. Both are solid display faces <BR>but get overused in these areas. <BR>
    <BR>Can you show this a little bit bolder?  <BR> <BR>The only thing I could suggest
    is opening the curlicues &#40;sp.&#41; <BR>on the Q, 2 and 3 a bit more. <BR>
    <BR>If you want to go more cute, more curlicues. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>

  body: 'bj, <BR> <BR>Thanks! I am currently working on a bolder version of the face,
    I&#39;ll post as more develops. When you speak of opening the curlicues, do you
    suggest that I end it earlier, or that the circle is not so tight? <BR> <BR>I
    desperately want to distribute my typefaces, but I fear I need to get more done
    with them. Most have a full character set, but very few have alternate weights. '

  body: Corey, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry I never managed to follow up on this thread
    back in June. Tardiness aside, I&#39;d like to encourage to follow bj&#39;s advice
    and chat with us folks at Veer about distributing your faces. I am really digging
    the friendliness and quirkiness of Babbage. Can&#39;t wait to see the bold weight.
    Any plans to tackle an italic version? You could do a lot with those undulating
    horizontal elements combined with the slight diagonals of an italic. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    contact me if you&#39;re at all interested in chatting further.

  body: This is an attractive font, and the curliques are similar to handwriting,
    which personalizes the font, yet it is readable.
