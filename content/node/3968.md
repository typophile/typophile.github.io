body: I have seen a few logotypes that resemble this font, but I haven&#39;t been
  able to find an actual face that is too similar. &#40;if you know of one, tell me&#41;
  This is my first font and I&#39;ve only been working on it for a few weeks now..
  Already I have many alternates for a lot of the letters, and it&#39;s tough deciding
  which ones will go in the final product. &#40;especially the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34;&#41;
  So far there is only a lower case, but I plan to have a full character set plus
  an alternate or &#34;expert&#34; face when I finish.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/322.gif"

  body: ' Nice. It&#39;s similar in feel to Lance Wyman&#39;s logo and font for the
    1968 Olympic Games in Mexico, or even Pritchard Line Out. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be
    interested in seeing some of the alternates, especially to the lc &#34;e&#34;.

  body: Thanks! <BR> <BR>the MEXICO 68 logotype was definately an inspiration, except
    I went with 2 stripes instead of 3. TURBO&#39;s letter forms are based off of
    all of the geometric, avant garde style faces out there, ie House&#39;s CHALET
    TOKYO. Below are some of the lc &#34;e&#34; alts that are already finished. Also,
    you can see alternate &#34;b&#34; &amp; &#34;d&#34;,  the same letterforms that
    makes up &#34;q&#34; &amp; &#34;p&#34; . <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/333.gif"

    <BR> <BR>2 - Mecanorma&#39;s Dubbeldik &#40;only sample I find is in FontShop&#39;s
    FontBook&#41; <BR> <BR>...but is differs beautifully from both. &#40;Only the
    &#39;k&#39;  <BR>bothers me, but I can&#39;t propose a better solution, so <BR>I&#39;m
    a worthless heap.&#41; I&#39;ve long seen promise in the  <BR>multiline bauhaus
    forms and you&#39;ve brought that  <BR>potential to reality. This can definitely
    be a seller.  <BR>What vending options have you considered? <BR> <BR>Stephen <BR>
    <BR>Dave T. - nice to see you here!

  body: ' Ah -- the lc &#34;k&#34; bothers me a bit too, and I think I just realized
    why: its x-height differs from that of the other letters. Same is true with the
    lc &#34;h&#34;, to a lesser degree. It doesn&#39;t bother me as much with the
    lc &#34;i&#34;, though. Still, that&#39;s a relatively easy fix. Overall, the
    font is a good one. <BR> <BR>I think I personally prefer the non-tilted alternate
    lc &#34;e&#34; to the tilted one, too. <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing your
    complete set. <BR> <BR>David Thometz <BR> <BR>Stephen - Hey! Thanks! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
