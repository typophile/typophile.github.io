body: As you can see, some of my characters have gotten a bit rusty. It's very humid
  here and these particular sorts don't get out much. I'd like to hear from typophile
  members with experience in cleaning up and caring for metal type. Any suggestions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typecase_3597.jpg]

    traces of the lye salts. If not the type will develop a white powdery bloom. I
    find it best after rinsing and rinsing, to then brush each letter with a tooth
    brush and something oily like kerosene or coal oil. This keeps the type from growing
    any more oxide.\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    kerosene or coal oil, the ink won't transfer from the roller to the type.\r\n\r\nIf
    the type has been stored for some time the residue will have evaporated; there
    will be no trace of it and and type will ink again.\r\n\r\nLeaving the oily solvent
    on the type does prevent it from developing \"type rust\" (oxides) even after
    long periods.\r\n\r\nJim [img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    Now to go out and buy some lye...\r\n\r\nHrant, the brass cornered case came from
    a fleamarket in Amsterdam (for a lot less than US$105). I didn't know about you

    sell lots of 'em."

  body: "Ben\r\n\r\nLead can't rust, so I don't know what the coloration is in your
    pic. But it does look like you do have some oxidation going on there as well.
    This is bad. Lead oxide. White lead. This is what causes lead poisoning. Also
    a great ingrediant in ink\u2014rich long lasting blacks (Gutenberg, and apparently
    he alone, used it). This corrosion is usually caused by a reaction of some sort
    combining humidity and acid. Dampness in the case (reaction with the wood lignum),
    salt water, urine (yes), cigarette ash (oddly enough, it eats holes in the lead),
    and probably others.\r\n\r\nYou want to get rid of this. I don't know how effective
    lye is against this so much as it was used to clean ink from type in the old days.
    I usually recommend scrapping the type out as it is at this point hazardess.\r\n\r\nThe
    type lice referral in the earlier post is actually the lye itself not the oxide.
    Long story (and printer's tale) but printer's devils (young boys) responsible
    for cleaning the type would sprinkle the lye into the case (as a prank). When
    the compositors would set the type the lye would cause them to sneeze.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: I think you aught to keep your type after you treat it but don't do anything
    until you fully understand the toxic potential of what you have, what you will
    use to save it & the by-products of what you make. Poison sucks. BIG TIME. Plus
    lead does clearly make humans more & more stupid. Look it up - it's unambiguous!

  body: "I came across this thread when searching for a way to clean old metal type.
    This has really been the only useful source of info I've found so far. Oddly,
    I just listened to Tiffany Wardle's interview with TypeRadio last night and she
    said her favourite word was \"serendipity\" so it's quite serendipitous that the
    answer to my question was to be found on Typophile the very next day when I planned
    to sign-up. Hmm...anyway.\r\n\r\nI've got a small box of metal type my friend
    salvaged from the print shop his family used to run. It's filthy and I'd like
    to clean it so I can display it somehow but I don't know how and I'm not exactly
    liking the idea of getting some lye to clean it with. The two previous posts said
    beeswax can be used to clean metal type but how exactly is that done?"

  body: I think they were saying that bee's wax was good to preserve the type. Getting
    it clean would be a separate step. I am not saying this *is* a good idea but I
    wonder about silver polish. The idea behind this I understand it is that it aggressively
    bonds with the oxygen leaving the metal intact. I would research the idea further
    before I tried it. And maybe see what else folks here say.

    try that. I'll definitely ask around first. Thanks for the tip.

  body: "That \"oxide\" actually looks like rust, but lead does not rust. Perhaps
    the colouration was transferred from very wet metal galley.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    lye is not as readily available as one might think. It was until recently. Ask
    a local soapmaker, they have difficulty getting lye. The stuff sold in hardware
    stores usually are \"now\" substitute chemicals.\r\n\r\nLead oxide should be viewed
    as electrolysis. This happens when metals of different nobilities are in direct
    contact. This activity can readily happen between type metal and metal gallies.
    \r\n\r\nZinc is so low in nobility it is used as sacrificial metal to preserve
    the fastenings and propellers on boats. This is why metal galley cabinets should
    have zinc between the cabinet and the floor and inspected annually. If it turns
    white, which it will, replace it.\r\n\r\nThat said I never suffered from lead
    oxide deterioration.\r\n\r\n"
