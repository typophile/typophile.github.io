  I am having to do this manually by creating separate boxes per line of type. This
  is very slow and infuriating if your working with large volumes of text.\r\n\r\nsee
  this site for an example of what i mean\r\nhttp://www.food2.com/recipes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts
  relatively easy in indesign, just a case of setting an underline with an offset."
