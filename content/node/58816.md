    all my friends and family to buy nothing but fonts (and softwares)for birthdays
    and Christmas.

  body: You won't find many "font collectors" here on typophile. Most people here
    view fonts as tools, licensed as needed for particular jobs, or occasionally acquired
    on spec. They don't collect them in the same way as people collect stamps or cats.

    really shouldn\u2019t finish that sentence\u2026\r\nA far more honest way to extend
    your type collection is by making your own. That way you will appreciate the effort
    a type designer has to put into each typeface. \r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: i'm fairly new at this.  i thought i was supposed to collect a lot of fonts
    and then choose the best one for whatever i'm working on out of my list. but after
    reading the responses, i think the general idea is to 1.) make your own fonts
    or 2.) just use the basic ones already on your computer.  right? thanks for the
    responses

  body: "If you think of fonts as tools, you can use the ones given to you by your
    uncle Steve (the bundled fonts), you can go around yard sales, Home Depot or break
    into sheds, and assemble a tool collection. Then when you have a project you can
    randomly try each tool until you find one that works.\r\n\r\nAn alternative plan
    would be to acquire a basic tool set and buy additional tools as needed.\r\n\r\nFortunately
    with fonts, there's the undo button, so there's little chance of flooding your
    basement, or setting fire to your roof, by using the wrong font. "

  body: "etahchen,\r\n\r\nAs you probably noticed, even the suggestion of trying to
    find a lot of fonts without paying for them rubs many here the wrong way--thus
    the terse responses.\r\n\r\nI know from experience that trying to make my own
    typeface increased my appreciation of the work the professionals do, but making
    your own typefaces is not a serious option for most.\r\n\r\nIf you want to legitimately
    expand on the choice of typefaces your system offers without spending an extreme
    amount, these typophile resources might be useful:\r\n\r\nGood Libre Fonts: [[http://typophile.com/node/18207?|http://typophile.com/node/18207?]]\r\nFont
    Starter Packs: [[http://typophile.com/node/30047?|http://typophile.com/node/30047?]]\r\nFAQ
    Free: [[http://typophile.com/node/44453?|http://typophile.com/node/44453?]]\r\n\r\nIf
    you are a student/faculty member, Adobe offers two very good type collections
    for Education:\r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/education/products/fontfolioeducationessentials/index.html|Font
    Folio Education Essentials]]\r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/education/products/typeclassics.html|Type
    Classics for Learning]]\r\n\r\nI've found that a combination of Open Source fonts
    available on Linux and Adobe's type collection for Education has given me a very
    nice tool set of typefaces to try out--representatives of several periods and
    styles, without so much that I get lost. With that as a foundation, I've been
    able to buy other typefaces as I need them. Of course, I'm just a Mathematics
    instructor, so you may be beyond this point. Still, I wanted to try to offer a
    helpful post.\r\n\r\nst\r\n\r\n"
