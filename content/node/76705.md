body: "Looking for a serif face that would go well with Vitesse Sans.\r\nMostly to
  be used as a secondary typeface for an identity system.\r\nThe identity will most
  likely be in Vitesse Sans. \r\nThe serif, should preferably be something that works
  well for both print and web. \r\nBut only print faces are also welcome.\r\nI'm thinking
  something in contrast to the rectangular aspect of Vitesse. \r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: Or Neuton. Neuton is a lovely text face for screen and print. The italic is
    about to be released, too, I hear.

    Is it Forza your talking about? Or another typeface called Vitesse?"

    it's an early version of Forza, \"leaked\" before H&FJ published it."

  body: Vitesse sans and serif where custom designed by HFJ for Wire magazine, but
    they end up floating around on the web. You will recognize them cause they have
    the wire magazine logo included on the glyphs.
