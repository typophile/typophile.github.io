  body: "Explain the name. Why light? Like light weight (not powerful)? What does
    the mark after the name mean? Would anyone know what it meant without an explaination?
    I think this first version makes lux look weak (almost industrial, boring). I
    doubt that is the image you want the company to have. \r\n\r\nYou have two problems
    the concept is weak and the execution is weak.\r\n\r\nOne last question. Isn't
    fashion and modeling about style and substance?"

    that brings ellegance, simplicity.. but im concerned bout the lettering, not bout
    the symbol"

    kinda dated and 'retro', they at least do to me, and that may mess with the modern,
    light look of the type.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dav.name\" target=\"_blank\">Dav</a>"

  body: "Next to the l and u the x lacks the elegant quality, the languid curves.
    The diamonds are not integrating with the lettering, they seem a bit narrow and
    weighty.\r\nTim"

  body: "Well the x looks a touch too tall and low and the strokes a little too heavy,
    to integrate it more you could look at some other x's like\u2026\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/auto-2/light-italic/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typebox/tx-wirish/light/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/preface/\r\n\r\n\u2026for

  body: "I think the straight bar of the x needs to have a touch off the top and bottom
    (especially at the top it appears to be jutting out too much, this is visual rather
    than mathematical and might also be affected by my screen, printing it out and
    using that is generally more reliable than screen I find). The junction of the
    vertical and curve on the u is taking the attention a bit you could try raising
    the outside curve of the serif a touch, see if you can lighten it. As for the
    kerning ux could be a little bit tighter but really doesn't need much in my view.\r\nTim"
