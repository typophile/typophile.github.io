  and I can't figure out why it won't attach."

  body: "If it is the sans, it could be <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrotesque\">Bureau
    Grotesque</a> from Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nIf it is the serif, it could be <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eldorado\">Eldorado</a>
    also from Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nHmm. In the 90s, Premiere and Entertainment Weekly
    both had great design going on, I could have the fonts confused. But, I thought
    I'd take a blind stab anyway."
