  above the baseline? It's a widespread enough practice that I wonder how it all got
  started. I think it can look fairly decent on signage/ads if the proportions are
  handled well but I could see how this might be a typographic sin to others. Would
  you do the same in certain situations?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/399_4612.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6a00d83451b3c669e201347fb68773970c-800wi_5162.jpg]"

  body: In grade school, we were taught to draw the $ on the baseline, same size as
    a capital S. But all the (non-teacher) adults in my life drew a small '$' raised
    up (and slightly skewed) in their handwriting. For this reason I thought of the
    smaller raised $ as more sophisticated- adult.
