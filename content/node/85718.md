  flat-out lying XP rendering samples &c and I'd really like to get all cards out:
  So, all ye developers, stat counters and type aficionados -- how many web users
  are still seeing Windows XP's default greyscale rendering? Really?\r\n\r\nI apologize
  for beating a dead horse. But is it dead?\r\n\r\n"

  body: The W3C claims 38% of browser users are on XP. I think that we can safely
    assume that at least 90% of people who still use XP have no idea how to change
    rendering settings. Internet World Statistics estimates that there are 2,095,006,005
    web users worldwide. So my guess is that at least 716,492,052 web users around
    the world are still on XP with default settings.

  body: "I think the methods for getting these numbers haven\u2019t changed since
    you last brought this up, though the percentages probably have.\r\n\r\nMy accurate
    numbers for last week:\r\n\r\nOut of a total of 6159 browser requests to a general
    interest site, 1439 came from Windows XP (including bots claiming that they\u2019re
    on XP). Of these 1439 requests, 663 came from browsers that can display web fonts,
    but don't override the ClearType settings of the system. That\u2019s 10.76 % of
    the total requests.\r\n\r\nIn other numbers, of 129 requests to the web fonts
    files, 19 (14.7 %) came from browsers on Windows XP that respect the system font
    rendering settings.\r\n\r\nI know you asked for \xBBhow many users\xAB, not for
    requests, but counting users is hard, and counting requests gives a more accurate
    reperesentation of real usage (think of one user using ClearType, but only reading
    one page vs. one user without ClearType reading 20 pages)."

  body: "Thanks Jens. These numbers are good. I can\u2019t help think many would upgrade
    beyond IE6 even though they are using other browsers. Perhaps the numbers are
    even better. \r\n\r\nAnyway: The last time around, the answer was close to 30
    % (based on similar numbers from Wikipedia). Statistics grow more accurate with
    quanitity, so keep em coming."
