body: "I've been challenged with, in the word of the client, \"freshening up\" the
  brand for a mid-size bank that hasn't changed a thing about its look and feel since
  it was created in 1987. They are not willing to change their logo, which uses Eras
  as it's primary typeface. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the words \"Eras\" and \"fresh\"
  do not belong in the same sentence.\r\n\r\nSo I think the best I'm going to be able
  to do is select a new typeface for their tagline, which could therefore be used
  as the primary typeface in advertising, stationery, etc. I'm thinking it needs to
  be a serif face, as to not conflict with Eras, but I'm open to other suggestions.
  I'm having a hard time finding a serif typeface that looks contemporary enough to
  compensate for the use of Eras in the logo, but also timeless enough to work in
  case it's another 20 years before they update their look again.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? "

    is being used? How long of a logotype is it? What colors are present? Is there
    another element involved? \r\n\r\nStrictly speaking I don't think it has to be
    a serif. Two sans, heck 3 sans, can be used together happily, it just takes finesse."

  body: "Here's their website. Our agency only recently acquired this account, so
    we had nothing to do with the current look. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.carolinafirst.com/personalbanking/index.asp\r\n\r\nWhat
    I need to do is find a primary typeface that can be used in headlines, the tagline
    (which we have rewritten), on outdoor, etc. They are currently using Eras for
    everything except the tag, and that needs to change, but the \"Carolina First\"
    part of the logo and the \"1\" symbol isn't going anywhere.\r\n\r\nAs far as colors
    go, we're hoping to transition them away from gold towards silver and gray.\r\n\r\nWe
    have some great, progressive tv and print concepts, but my main challenge at this
    point is figuring out a way to avoid their current look from taking the viewer
    back to 1989."

  body: 'Can the logo design stick with Eras but be redesigned using roman letters
    in a lighter weight? Because what I see really dating this is not so much the
    typeface itself, but that it is huge and clumped into one long clod of text. An
    airy, lightweight logo set in Eras with the tagline also set in Eras could end
    up looking very contemporary, especially with new colors. '

    '80s, but I guess my fondness for it is just childhood nostalgia.
