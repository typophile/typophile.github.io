		<div class="commentbody">On what platform do you work, Sita? MS Windows or MacOS? <BR> <BR>OpenType is bound to become the new standard and it's cross-platform,  <BR>so you can't lose. Unfortunately QuarkXPress still doesn't support them, <BR>so that could be a problem. They work perfectly with Adobe software. <BR> <BR>The typefaces that come with your Adobe applications are licensed  <BR>for any work, including commercial, but that license is limited to the  <BR>computer the software is installed on (and probably some output  <BR>device). So basically you can't install them on any other computer than  <BR>the one the software they are bundled with is installed on. <BR>You should be able to find more details about the extent of the license  <BR>in the documentation that comes with the software package(s).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, <BR>Being a recent graduate faced with purchasing several fonts this year, this issue is one that I have been wondering about. I'm on a Mac, use Quark, and have read about the problems with Open Type, so have opted to purchase either True Type or PS fonts &ndash; never really knowing why I'm choosing one over the other &ndash; but I think I've read PS fonts will go the way of the dinosaurs, so True Type is the better choice - correct? <BR> <BR>However, I hate the idea of investing so much money in either format if Open Type is going to take over. Does that mean I'll eventually have to repurchase the fonts I've spent so much on this year?  Just yesterday I purchase Sparrowhawk on Veer for $39 (!) and it only offered one format (it didn't say which one it is) - BUT it doesn't work in the Microsoft Office  Entourage program (trying to create a logo for an email signature), so I'm either feeling a bit cheated &ndash; OR I just need to tweak something somewhere to get it to work (probably the later but the constant detective work of what needs tweaking is soooo time consuming!)  <BR> <BR>How should I think about font formats in order to make the best long term investment? Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Service bureau would be the people who take your files and output film - may be the print shop in your case. If as part of your production process you need to give them fonts (license permitting) as well as Photoshop and Illustrator files then you should ask them what they prefer.  <BR> <BR>With respect to Donna's question - the OpenType fonts will likely contain goodies and extras accessible in Adobe apps and eventually Quark. If you don't need or want the extras there's no need to upgrade. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Apparently, Quark 7 will come out later this year, and support the full range of OpenType features. So you can continue to work in the page layout program you're comfortable with, and not miss out on special OpenType features.  <BR> <BR>The legacy font formats of PostScript Type 1 and TrueType will continue to work for many, many years to come. <BR> <BR>So you can feel comfortable buying any format you like. <BR> <BR>Of course, like any software, fonts can have bugs; and in that, no format or foundry is immune.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Before OpenType fonts became available, for print work I preferred working with Type 1 PostScript fonts rather than TrueType&hellip; They were more reliable than most of the TT fonts I was familiar with. <BR> <BR>Briefly, the differences are that PostScript fonts have two components: a suitcase containing the screen fonts and separate files for the printer fonts, while TT fonts combine these into one scalable font file&hellip; Also, PostScript fonts use the same page-description technology as laser printers. <BR> <BR>As for OpenType, it is a cross-platform format, meaning you can use the same font file on a Macintosh or Windows machine. OpenType fonts have room for many more characters than the older font formats.</div>

I keep a few Type 1 fonts around for specific compatibility needs. <BR> <BR>But then again, that's predictable: I work for Adobe (inventors of Type 1, and co-developers of OpenType), and we stopped making new Type 1 fonts in 1999, to switch to OpenType. <BR> <BR>We will likely stop selling Type 1 fonts this year, but that's another story, which I will cover in more depth at various type conferences later this year. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>
