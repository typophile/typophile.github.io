  body: "Great! This is yet another step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nTo further
    improve on this concept though, it'd be nice if I didn't have to clutter my RSS
    list with all the individual feeds, and could instead mark threads to be included
    in a combined \"watched\" list, whether or not I've commented on them. Such a
    list could be viewed on the site, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013\_could have
    it's own RSS feed.\r\n\r\nThe need for this kind of thing is apparent from all
    the people adding comments on a thread that are devoid of any information (usually
    <a href=http://typophile.com/node/72683#comment-422777>a single period</a>). When
    I first saw these non-comments, I thought they were spam, but eventually realized
    that people were using it as a hack in order to see when there had been new comments,
    via their Track page.\r\n\r\nTo complement the concept of an RSS feed for \"watched\"
    items, it'd also be nice to have an RSS feed for threads which I've commented
    on.\r\n\r\nFinally, to round out the system, perhaps a single feed for both \"watched\"
    and \"commented on\" threads (so as to avoid duplicates where the two might overlap).\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work!"
