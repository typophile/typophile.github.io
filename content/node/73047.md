  body: "Could even have been constructed from scratch, or close to it. That \"K\"
    is awfully wide, and the \"e\" wider than the \"O\"... also look how the top bar
    of the \"T\" is thicker than the vertical (unlike the \"H\").\r\n\r\nI think you
    might have to redraw the darn thing, if they don't have it in a useful digital
    form.\r\n\r\nT"
