No, but the FAQ specifically asks to do a Search first if you know what you're looking for, so Florian's remark was warranted. I think he reacted more to the <em>"If I had time"</em> remark which made me jump as well. Especially since doing a Google Search takes exactly 0.22 seconds, so why waste our time then? :^P
Let's say that -- fair enough -- this time it wasn't <em>really</em> necessary, but we've had times that it can became very tedious answering the same question over and over again. There's a reason why I put that in the FAQ. ;^)</div>

Exactly.
I have no problem with id-ing, searching or advising how to search – even if it was one of those notorious recurrent queries – it can be great fun, otherwise we all won’t be here, would we?
Yet, I might have a problem with being treated as if this was a paid service.
Well, Ella nicely said thank you and everything is okay again. ;°)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Every time (not sometimes, but every single time) the issue of search comes up it's because the user is new here. (I always check how long a user has been a member). As easy as it is for us, navigation is not very novice friendly on Typophile. Information is layers deep or overwhelming. Search is apart of that too (even Google). With regards to <em>"If I had the time"</em>... maybe she doesn't understand the process/mess here or she's busy or even lazy. Doesn't matter to me... because I have immediately took into account that Ella is new. Did anybody else here? Yes, Marten did when he gave her the correct answer then positively encouraged her to use the Google search. That's how you do it.

<em>Well, better let others spend their time, huh? :^(</em> This question is repellent and not welcoming. I don't want Ella to have the impression that those who ask questions have to feel responsible or owe or have to answer back to us. We do it for fun. We are not paid. In the scheme of things Typophile is just a trivia endeavor. 

That's why I said what I said.

I will always give the newbie the benefit of the doubt. I will always light the rear-end of the person who doesn't either.

Some of us are are experienced designers with degrees and accolades all over our wall or some of us are just lovers of type with few a questions to ask here and there. So its a cacophony of voices but we especially like yours. Please continue to post. We like you- <em>even if your from New Jersey</em>- kidding :o) Also glad that you found the right font for the job.

BTW... Florian is an excellent font ID'r and Yves is our very own font ID moderator. Both very nice people.
