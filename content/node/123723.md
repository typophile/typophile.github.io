  Queens Museum. I found the choice of typeface to be quite interesting -- it seems
  to be an unusual marriage of Futura and Akzidenz-Grotesk. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wf-1_5106.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wf-2_6122.jpg]"

  body: "Unfortunately, don't have the answer, was not even able to find this poster
    online (sure about its originality?).\r\nMainly because of single storey /a and
    cross-shaped /t, [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/ag+schoolbook|AG Schoolbook]]
    comes to mind but that's far from it either. There's also [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/ag+old+face|AG
    Old Face]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-schulbuch|FF Schulbuch]]
    but still not matching.\r\nReminds me a lot of [[http://typophile.com/node/95908|this
    previous discussion]] about 2012 edition of Whitney Museum Membership Calendar
    font. It was identified as Mike Gallagher's [[http://mikegallagher.org/gross.html|Gross]]
    which actually does not look like it at all... But the one from your sample and
    the one on Whitney Museum Membership Calendar looks pretty close, some kind of
    textbook/infant version of Akzidenz-Grotesk.\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/mark|Mark]]

  body: "Brown was not available in 1964, but Brown Bold has many similar letters
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrowneBoldAsCome_4242.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrownBoldAsNew_3808.gif]
    to the poster lettering.\r\nThe file info for Browne gives credit to Arno Drescher's
    Super Grotesk and Edward Johnston's Johnston.\r\nIt is plausible that these same
    sources were influences on the design of our mystery lettering of 1964.\r\nCompare
    to Super Grotesk Med which was available in 1964 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFSuperGroteskMedAsCome_5081.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFSuperGroteskMedAsNew_4213.gif]\r\nand
    the condensed version of _C_ [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFSuperGroteskCondMed_C_5752.gif]\r\nwhich
    is now digitized by Font Font http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-supergrotesk/\r\nDon"
