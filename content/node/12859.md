    Windows, go into Accessories->System Tools->Character Map and you can copy the
    Greek characters to your application.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "One way is to open the Character Palette and click on the Greek category.
    The fonts with Greek support are listed at the bottom under Font Variation.\r\n\r\nThe
    Character Palette is accessed via the little flag icon in the menu bar. If you
    don't have one of those, you can enable it by going to the International control
    panel in System Preferences. Click on the Input Menu tab and then check the box
    labeled Character Palette."
