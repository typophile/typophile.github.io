body: "Hello !\r\nI am a College Professor and with the help of a designer I recreated
  the font of my old typewriter. I am around to publish a new textbook using this
  font but I would like to have some very simple (for someone familiar with font software)
  enhancements:\r\n\r\n- Bold Version (a simple underlined version of the normal font);\r\n-
  Spacing of the font: they original typewriter as a slightly different spacing between
  one letter and the other e.g. \r\nHello looks more spaced in the original format
  than in my current font reproduction so a bit more like H e l l o (well not with
  so much spacing but you got the point I guess) \r\n\r\nPrompt payment via paypal
  or similar - and obviously the great deed to help reconstructing an historic typeface
  to be as close as possible to the original even in these small details :) \r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time and kind attention,\r\n\r\nBests\r\nDavid "
