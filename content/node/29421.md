body: "Hey Typophiles,\r\n\r\nSo I'm currently revising and updating my portfolio.
  In the process, I noticed that my personal wordmark, which I designed in school
  (7 or 8 years ago), looks slightly discontinuous, most likely as a result of the
  mixed thicks and thins:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_old_6718.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I've set out to tweak it slightly, make it more harmonious and improve the overall
  aesthetic quality while bringing it a little more in line with the rest of my identity.
  I've swapped out the Gill Sans \"g\" and replaced it with a Meta Bold one. I've
  made some adjustments to the very top of the \"g\" so as to allow it to blend into
  the \"c\" more smoothly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_new_3731.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd,
  for good measure, the two paired side by side:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_together_6720.gif]\r\n\r\nThoughts
  and suggestions of all sorts would be appreciated."

    C thinner as you suggested. Sorted!\r\n\r\nI'd like to see how it looks accompanied
    by text to explain it out."

  body: "The ear of the g join to the C is clumsier in the Meta version, although
    that of the Gill one is a touch too long. I would like to see the angle of the
    bottom terminal of the C reflected a bit more in that join, further, the relationship
    of the shapes in the bottom right is more harmonious in the Gill version.\r\nSeeing
    it with the supporting text might change my mind.\r\nTim"

  body: "Agree\r\nI would take a close look into Gill's attributes. If you are using
    the semi circle as a \"C\" then you might look at the ending angles. On your current
    \"C\" of  the gill sans ends up on a vertical ( 90 degrees angle) and the bottom
    one at a different one.\r\n\r\nAlso take a look at Gill Sans \"@\" and compare
    the stroke weight. \r\nI agree that the ear of the \"g\" is too long. Play with
    it so that the \"g\" is still centered. You might want to shorten the \"C\" on
    top a tad resize it but keep the stroke weight and the original ending angles
    or if you modify them, keep both at the same angle.\r\n\r\nShow us the accompanied
    text!\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nKco[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_4953.gif]"

    in that there is little support for the Meta G then?\r\n\r\nI'll try and get some
    new versions up later tonight."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_slimgill_3608.gif]\r\n\r\nOk! Here's
    a slimmer C-shape (I somehow don't think I was using a Gill Sans C after all.
    Oh those strange days of being an undergrad!), with the Gill Sans G. I've taken
    the suggestions to heart and tried to ensure the top terminal of the C-shape is
    closer in appearance to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd, as requested, with accompanying
    text, which is simply my full name and whose treatment also dates back to my school
    days:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_type_5746.gif]"

  body: "I like the the angles of the new \"C\" looks sharper. Although Gill \"C\"
    endings are cut vertically why not try one like that so it has more resemblance
    of the typeface?. If you really want to try Meta how about a lighter version?
    the bold one just makes it horsey and claustrophobic. And I wouldn't mix two sans
    serif, specially meta and gill. Use what ever is on your icon. Otherwise I'd keep
    Gill\r\n\r\nKco"

  body: "I'd hate to ruffle any feathers here, but I like the meta direction much
    more. However, I do agree even with this version that the terminal angles are
    not working well together. Maybe try one of the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Alter
    the upper terminal to relate to the lower terminal.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2. Pull the
    bottom C terminal up to be even with the g's, then slice it flat (even with the
    g's). Use the resulting implied frame (produced from the C's upper and lower 90
    degree terminals) to begin your logotype.\r\n\r\nEither approach requires more
    refinement than is stated, but it's a start.\r\n\r\nAloha!"

  body: "Thanks again for all the suggestions. The terminal question is definitely
    something I'm going to resolve before I finalize this logo.\r\n\r\nI'm using Meta
    for my other personal collateral \u2013\_resume, portfolio, business cards, etc.
    I think at this point, I'm going to look at refining the current Gill G logo.
    I'm thinking I may be able to set my name in a lighter weight of Meta, or perhaps
    the caps, and manage to sneak by for now.\r\n\r\nMore soon."
