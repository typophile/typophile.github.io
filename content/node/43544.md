body: "I was thinking, after noticing the 500th post titled \"WHAT IS THIS?!\" with
  a link to imageshack, that there must be a better way to do type ids.\r\n\r\nOf
  all the forums, I think the Type ID board gets the most workout during the day.
  I've seen an influx of fresh faces all asking the same question... \"This is awesome,
  what is it? By the way I need to know immediately.\"\r\n \r\nI'm not trying to dispel
  the bad habits of people that didn't know other wise. I just think the forum could
  use a little more organization. Could save a few members some headaches.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  the \"open\" approach towards the Type ID forum should be corralled. A form with
  instructions could be a more benefiting approach.\r\n\r\n1. <b>Title</b> - please
  be specific, refrain from using \"What is this font\" or any variations. (think
  of poor Yves)\r\n2. <b>Image upload link</b> - please don't post links to outside
  websites or image hosting, that may be blocked on some member's computers.\r\n3.
  <b>comments/information</b> - What do you know about this font, where did you find
  it, is there specific thing you'd really like to know.\r\n4. <b>tags</b>\r\n\r\nThis
  is just a suggestion of course. I think it would help clear up some confusion, help
  speed up type IDs and help people search for IDs already made. \r\n\r\nI know that
  Typophile is a labor of love for some of the Punchcut crew and other Typophile members.
  I don't expect these changes to be made. Though it would be cool to see my suggestions
  implemented."

  body: Andrew, many of your suggestions are addressed quite clearly in the FAQ (especially
    about giving your threads more specific titles) and in "How to post a sample or
    image". It seems lots of people can't be bothered to read the FAQ, even tho it
    says READ THIS FIRST. There was also a recent epidemic of people re-posting threads
    when they weren't ID'd quickly enough - one guy hadn't even attached a visual!
    I mean, we are not psychic - and I got reamed (by Furioustype for one, LOL) for
    chastising them.

  body: It's funny, I believe the "PLEASE READ THIS FIRST" FAQ actually seems to cover
    these points, but it seems that some people can't be bothered to read it first.
    Perhaps the only way to make some notice at all would to put the text with the
    above-mentioned suggestions in some separate box at the top of the forum, rather
    than an actual forum post itself. I'm no web developer, but I think it would take
    a lot less time to read the PLEASE READ HIS FIRST than it would for someone else
    to code that new window in.

  body: "Exactly Patty, that's why I made the suggestion, nobody reads the FAQs. The
    main thing is that it's a form.   With a form, you can control the content better
    and reduce the chances that someone will post something without an image, or a
    clear understandable title. You can even block \"What is this Font\" from being
    used, or any other popular phrase. The form acts as a posting moderator. Plus
    poor Yves wouldn't have to waste time changing the titles to reflect that the
    original poster should posted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's just a suggestion. "

    maybe spoiling the fun a bit.\r\n\r\nIf IDing feels like work, don\u2019t do it!
    Sure this service is being taken advantage of. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all
    about. If something like WHATSISFONT...INEEDIDASAP!!!!! comes up maybe a standart-reply
    like <em>Please read guidelines first</em> would work. BTW - the Type ID Board
    doesn\u2019t have guidelines like General Discussions, just FAQs. FAQs aren\u2019t
    read unless there <em>is</em> a question."

    with you. Particularly the learning part. While nowhere in the same league as

    of peripheral information. \r\n\r\n\"I wonder if all the type ID pop quizzes at

    an idea to have the posting guidelines come up as a mandatory step before a member

    thing, and as a noob, I probably did. \r\n\r\nIt does illustrate that unlike other
