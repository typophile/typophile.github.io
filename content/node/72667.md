  here: \r\n\r\n[link removed by moderator]\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not know the font
  that this comes from. I'm looking for the \"parent\" font that the author turned
  into a stencil type font. Essentially, I'm looking for this simple, sans-serif font
  to use with glaserSted.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nDrew\r\n"
