    including Dyslexie, whose basic concept is followed in the font described in the
    BBC article. He is rightly critical of misdiagnosis of the problem that the font
    makers claim to be solving, and of the absence, as Chris notes, of any scientific
    research to back up the claims.\r\nhttp://www.commarts.com/columns/should-dyslexics-unite.html\r\n\r\nTom
    also has a follow-up blog post:\r\nhttp://www.thomasphinney.com/2012/06/should-dyslexics-unite-on-a-typeface/\r\n\r\nOne
    of the points that Tom makes is that current scientific understanding of dyslexia
    is that it is a <em>phonological</em> deficit, i.e. a problem in the cognitive
    processing of language, and not a visual problem.\r\n"

  body: Well, the article records one dyslexic saying that he found it easy to read.
    Nice anecdotal evidence, but note that the same person commends the spacing of
    the font, so maybe the letter forms themselves are not providing the perceived
    benefit. It is more widely spaced than typical text fonts, which Kevin Larson
    would predict to improve reading for non-dyslexics too. That is just one of the
    factors for which no attempt has been made to control.

    disability is a relatively common developmental disorder, the aetiology of which
    is clouded by conflicting theoretical approaches and the heterogeneity of the
    subtypes found. Recent advances in understanding of the visual system have revived
    interest in the role of visual processing in the persisting inability to read
    fluently that characterises dyslexia. A new integrated model of visual processing
    based on primate single cell and human electrophysiology may provide such a framework,
    implicating the magnocellular pathway's role in activating and driving attentional
    mechanisms in higher order cortical regions. In particular, the recent introduction
    of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to create \u2018transient lesions\u2019
    may provide causal evidence for dorsal stream feedforward/feedback involvement
    in rapid visual processing tasks. Such organization is argued to be crucial for
    the development of fluent reading.\r\n\r\nThe following distinguishes between
    \u2018high-level\u2019 cognitive or language deficits associated with developmental
    dyslexia and \u2018low-level\u2019 perceptual or neurological deficits.\r\n\r\n\u201CDyslexia

    this article, we review research into the underlying deficits associated with
    the failure to learn to read normally, or developmental dyslexia. We focus on
    the heterogeneity within this broad category of disorder and on the relationship
    between the proposed deficits and the acquisition of specific kinds of reading
    skill. We also distinguish between \u2018high-level\u2019 cognitive or language
    deficits associated with developmental dyslexia and \u2018low-level\u2019 perceptual
    or neurological deficits. We conclude that the mixed and sometimes contradictory
    sets of findings associated with most of the proposed deficits reveal something
    important: that there is no single cause of developmental dyslexia and that it
    is likely that multiple causes interact in complex ways to impair reading acquisition.\r\n\r\nA
    central issue in this hypothesis seems to be \u2018visio-spatial resolution,\u2019
    which appears to be weak or diffuse in dyslexics. I suspect looking into the magnocellular
    deficit hypothesis (where the \u2018low-level\u2019 perceptual or neurological
    deficits seem to be based) is the way to go for those interested in type-design
    or typography-based remediation of dyslexia.\r\n\r\nGoogle the words \u2018dyslexia\u2019
    and \u2018magnocellular deficit,\u2019 for more."
