<div class=commentbody>I've always found this digraph to be as cloying (for me) as the historical ligatures st and ct. They call too much attention to themselves. I suppose for specific settings or maybe artistic settings they are useful though. The second from the left works best for me. The first and last (top line) read as CE to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Good point.
People with these digraphs in their alphabet (eg Scandinavian languages) don't have that "CE" problem, but for English usage of Œ as a ligature, a more "O-ish" left half might be better. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, Scandinavian languages don't use œ (you might be thinking of ø or ö). French is the only prominent modern language I can think of that uses œ, as in your example <em>œuf</em>.
I have no problems with the lowercase œ, but the designs of the uppercase Œ often do bother me, and I sometimes wonder if a form where an O with minimal optical distortion just touches E might work better at least for those who don't use this grapheme* on a daily basis. But we will also have to consult native French speakers on this one.
* I use <em>digraph</em> to mean a two-letter combination used for writing a single sound, such as <em>th</em> and <em>ng</em> in <em>thing</em>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like it. The U&lc more than the small-caps, as the ‘E’ unfortunately is straight on its left, and therefore tends to clog the gap.
How frequent are ‘Æ’ in ‘Œ’ in French, Danish and Norwegian?
This remarkable illustration is taken from a French primer (1967):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oeuf_6131.jpg]
Learning the letter ‘e’: An ‘oeuf’ looks like an ‘o’ – but sounds like an ‘e’. (The derivation sequence is a little bit bloated; what exactly happens between 2/3 and 5/6?)
Just wanted to add that, sorry for the digression.</div>

<div class=commentbody> I guess the capital digraph OE is more likely to appear in the word "oeuvre"
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oeuvres_6508.gif]
[at least on the internet]. See the site http://www.cardinalleger.com/
Edit. People may be less careful when writing "oeuf" than "oeuvre" ("Les Oeuvres du Cardinal Léger" becomes "The Endeavors of Cardinal Léger" in English). But there are so many French recipes... Who knows, at least when printed on paper. But don't forget, there are also "hors d'oeuvres", that are quite important in French cuisine. And there is also "main d'oeuvre" (manpower).</div>

<div class=commentbody>In French, there’s also bœuf (beef), cœur (hearth), manœuvre (operate), chef-d’œuvre (masterpiece), contrecœur (back-plate) and some others…
In any case, there’s nearly no occasion where the Œ ligature (or diagraph or grapheme) will be use with lower cases (the only possibilities are «œuf» or «œuvre» as the first noun of a book title. A sentence couldn’t begin with a common noun. So, mainly, this gliph will be use in an all lower cases or an all upper cases word.
As for reading CE, it’s a matter of habitude, I think. As a French reader, I would never have tought of this but have read OE by recognizing the character and the word instantly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just a simple remark : if I type “boeuf” instead of “bœuf” in Word on my sister’s PC, the word is automatically replaced by “bœuf” by the spell checker: if I can manage to get “boeuf” in the text, I get a mistake. Of course, if “œ” is not in the font, the result is a square for the missing character. The same holds for “Œ”.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>«How frequent are ‘Æ’ in ‘Œ’ in French, Danish and Norwegian?»</cite>
Since œ in French has already been dealt with by native French-speakers, I’ll speak only of æ in Danish and Norwegian (and also in Icelandic and Faeroese—or should that be Færœse? :-P).
Æ is very common in Danish and, unlike in French, it is not thought of as an actual combination of the letters a and e in the minds of the common Dane. Whereas a French person might easily type <em>oeuvre</em>, rather than <em>œuvre</em>, without really considering it ‘un-French’, no Dane would ever type ae, but always æ. The letter is about as common as ä is in German, perhaps slightly less so, since umlauts are more common in German than in Danish. As in German, æ is pronounced as [ɛ] in Danish (and Swedish, where it’s a bit more open).
In Norwegian, æ is less common than in Danish; many words where Danish uses æ (and German and Swedish use ä), Norwegian uses e instead: D <em>æbler</em>, S <em>äpplen</em>, G <em>Äpfeln</em>, but N <em>epler</em> (‘apples’). It’s pronounced [æ] in Norwegian.
In Icelandic and Faeroese, it’s even less common. In Faeroese, where it’s pronounced [æ] as in Norwegian, it’s used in a number of very common words where it’s a very strange development of an old Germanic i or Scandinavian é, such as F <em>mær, tær</em>, I <em>mér, þér</em>, G <em>mir, dir</em> (dative of ‘me, thou’), but apart from that, its usage is similar to Icelandic, where it’s only used as old i-umlauts of Old Norse a and is not that common. In Icelandic, it’s pronounced [ai], a diphthong.
&nbsp;
As for the digraphs themselves, I’ve never liked the uppercase Œ, either. In some fonts, they manage to get away with it and make it look sort of harmonic. The <em>Cardinal Léger</em> text above is a good example of that. But most commonly, it just looks like the poor O has had its skin pulled too taut, making it all warped stretched. Not pretty. I’ve never read it as a CE, though. More commonly (due to sheer ingrained habit, I suppose), I’ll instinctively read it as an æ instead, so <em>œufs</em> becomes <em>æufs</em>, which in turn becomes complete nonsense in my head and makes me stumble in reading.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>One of two things normally happens:
1. The vertical beam of the ɑ is retained, so there’s a vertical stroke between the ɑ and the e, or the curvature of the ɑ is made uneven, so it closes up towards the top right corner, rather than being properly circular (if that explanation makes sense). But they do end up looking rather similar. (Avant Garde uses the former way, fonts like Ayuthara—first one in my list of fonts that applies—do it the second way)
2. The ɑ is replaced by a two-storey a. (Futura does this)

<div class=commentbody>Ah, sorry, I completely misread that.
Uppercase Æ is quite common in the Scandinavian languages. Unlike French, Scandinavian languages have no problems starting sentences with nouns (since nouns without articles are often employed, and the definite articles are all suffixes, rather than separate words before the noun they qualify).
In <em>Retskrivningsordbogen</em> (the dictionary that dictates spelling in Danish), there are three pages of words beginning with the letter æ.</div>

It is used for Œdipe (and may thus appear many times in some text on psychology), Œta (a mountain in Greece) and in proper names of foreign people. And I learn from two (non recent) dictionaries of mine (Larouse and Hachette) that one may write either Œrsted or Ørsted.
In my "Petit Larouse illustré", I count 54 words (that are not proper names) including only one verb, "œuvrer" whose first letter is "œ". A sentence can start with a verb, for instance "Œuvrer", "Œuvrons", "Œuvrez" etc. The article in front of nouns may be elided in titles. So, in a title, you might get "Œcuménisme moderne" and, when the subject gets hot, newspaper titles may beat the statistics!</div>

I have to say I’d far prefer simply <em>Oersted</em>, or even <em>Orsted</em>, to <em>Œrsted</em>.

Well, I, as a Dane, am not one to lambast language councils for their sometimes dubitable decisions, considering how the Danish Language Council regularly butchers loan words in Danish in an attempt to make them ‘easier’ for Danes.
I quote, haphazardly, <em>majonæse</em> (for <em>mayonnaise</em>), <em>konjak</em> (for <em>cognac</em>), or <em>risalamande</em> (for <em>ris à l’amande</em>). The last one in particular grinds me, since <em>risalamande</em> is not even any more logical or phonetic in Danish than <em>ris à l’amande</em>.</div>

In German typo-/ortho-graphy (alone) it's acceptable to replace umlaut with a following e; a typographic alternative is to merge those letters (see also: e.g. http://www.liechtensteinmuseum.at/de/pages/home.asp 's typeface NEUE ÖFFNUNGSZEITEN SEIT 2. MÄRZ 2008 (with Ö and Ä as OE-lig, AE-lig )
It is not acceptable to use a postscript e for umlaut-dots in most other languages (compare: it's only acceptable to use apostrophe instead of caron for d, l and t in Slovak and Czech, not in any other language).
Still, I understand that Tiptoe was just your _source_ of inspiration. French indeed cries for Titlecase version for that letter :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>In Norwegian handwriting, æ is very similar to œ. I think most Norwegians don't even know œ excist. Actually, last saturday Dagbladet accidentally switched æ for œ in a headline.</div>

<div class=commentbody>That sounds very odd to me.
In handwriting, yes, æ is usually written very similar to œ (or rather, almost exactly like ce in joined-up writing). But I’ve never seen anyone confuse æ with œ in type. A classmate of mine who bought her computer in the US could never figure out how to type æ on her US keyboard layout, so she consistently used œ instead, but even though it was legible, everybody noticed that it looked wrong, and it slowed down reading.
That a newspaper could actually mix them up sounds completely bizarre and absurd to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>the latter just seems an odd, misplaced Frenchification more likely to cause confusion than anything.</cite>
The more I look the more I am puzzled.
I downloaded the two Mozilla French dictionaries from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/browse/type:3. The files have extension .xpi and you just unzip them to get the dictionaries, that are good old-style plain text ISO8859-15 (latin9) encoded files (one word per line); fr-FR.dic (82000 entries) would be the "pre 1990" version and fr.dic (1990 reform, 90 000 entries) would to be the most "modern" one. Instead of utf-8 re-encoding, I just used a unix window (on my mac) with "Window Settings > Display, Character Set Encoding > Western (ISO Latin 9)" and kept the files as is to better see the bugs.
I first looked at all proper names containing "oe" or "œ" in fr-FR.dic. Here is the command (I had to make a screen grab)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/egrep_6474.jpg]
and I got on the output the following list (one entry per line):
&nbsp;&nbsp;Coelho, Defoe, Goethe, Groenland, Hoegaerden, Hoeilaart, Koekelberg, Loewner, Noether, Oedipe/LM, OEM, Oersted/M, Piedbœuf, Schoenberg, Toeplitz, Westhoek.
This proves that in foreign names, even if "oe" is not pronounced as two separate letters, French will use "oe" if necessary, and not "œ". The entry "Oedipe" looks however erroneous and the fact that Oersted is not written "Œrsted" may unfortunately be explained by... a bug.
Indeed, if I look more carefully at the file fr-FR.dic (if I search for "rsted"), I realize that the character "Œ" was ill encoded; it was encoded twice 0xBE (for "Œrsted" and "Œdipe") and twice 0x8C (for "d'Œrsted" and "d'Œdipe"), instead of 0xBC. The entries "Oedipe" and "Oersted" might just be... a patch?
If I compare fr-FR.dic with fr.dic, I see that the entry "œrsted" (for the physical unit) has become "oersted", which seems to be reasonable but, on the other hand, many other "œ" are now "oe" in fr.dic, for unknown reasons. Those I have checked have not changed in the "Petit Robert" dictionary (online). Does anyone know who decided what in 1990? And do you know of more reliable plain text dictionaries?

<div class=commentbody>I have seen handwriting styles where (naturally) a single a is single-storey, but for &#230; a double-storey-A&ndash;E ligature is used.(starting like the bowl of the P, curling back at the bottom to form the A's bowl and writing an e, looking like antiqua print &#230;-s, connecting from left at the x-height, on the right at the baseline.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I normally write æ like that by hand (though the writing style I currently use the most has double-storey a’s, as well). However, it is far less common than the ‘ce’ style, at least in Denmark.
Another style is to actually write œ, which some people also do (I myself used to write æ’s like that previously).</div>

The <a href=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries target=_blank><em>OpenOffice dictionaries</em></a> are plain text and those for French I have looked at don't suffer from the "Œ" bug. It seems clear that "œrsted" is now "oersted" after the reform on which I could find some information <a href=http://www.renouvo.org/index.php target=_blank>here</a> (in French).
