    as well, but I would make the diagonal upstroke thinner (like in the original

    It was sort of a last minute throw-in anyway because we needed three. Here's the

  body: it's funny how the one you 'force out' (like your last) sometimes ends up
    getting the most attention.  i like all three, particularly the first, but i'm
    strangely drawn to the last as well, particularly with the improvement.

    the other two fit so well that there is no need to discuss them."
