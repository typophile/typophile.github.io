body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've made a new logo for a tree company, keeping it simplistic with
  helvetica and and a simple tree icon. Just looking for any feedback on it please
  especially in terms of the kerning, I'm a kerning newbie so I'm never fully sure
  if its ok or not. In particular with the T and r. Also if there any other suggestions
  for improvements. Cheers"

  body: "Before we get to the letterspacing, do reconsider the font choice: Helvetica
    is a staple of large nasty corporations, and everybody knows it (or at least feels
    it); are you sure you want it for a tree company? Actually even if it's a large
    nasty corporation, since you wouldn't want to let that on! Unless you're being
    a sneaky conscientious designer.  :-)\r\n\r\nAnd that \"a\"... yuk. Gag me with
    a pinecone.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Less space between the r and the e and a hair more between the double e.
    Maybe try slightly less traditional colors to offset the use of the traditional
    font. Green and brown for the tree biz is kind of clich\xE9. If you're going helvetica
    and geometric, look at some of the classic swiss design. The very obvious T +
    A = a tree combo needs to be countered with something a little less expected.\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the comments, I can see how the whole geometric/helvetica look
    is a bit too cold and corporate for a small tree nursey. Any suggestions for a
    warmer more personabile font? I think I may have to change the style completely

  body: It kind of depends on what type of tree company it is. Do they raise trees
    for industrial lumber or sell Christmas trees? Focus on the audience and the image
    they need to project. The concept is nice, but I get an institutional vibe, like
    a forest ranger asking to see my permit.
