  round to getting enough pictures and artwork on the walls for my wife's tastes!\r\n\r\nI
  got thinking today about producing a large scale work based upon a single glyph
  - either as a 2D print of some sort, or as a 3D object... It occured to me that
  with type having such a rich history that it would be hard to choose any particular
  glyph. Do I choose one based simply on it's form, or perhaps one based upon it's
  political history, or one that was simply part of an important event in the history
  of civilisation?\r\n\r\nI expect there are as many choices as there are reasons
  for making them. \r\n\r\nAlthough not my choice, consider the dollar sign? but in
  which typeface, and why?\r\n\r\nAny interesting ideas? It's really made me consider
  how poor is my knowledge of typographical history!\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n"

    It has all the prerequisites for this - adequate X-height, single bar in the middle

    of the Sun and Moon, the eye's pupil, and the Earth itself (although it took some
    time to figure that out). It is also geometrically perfect and is the symbol for
    zero and the letter O. In its utilitarian manifestations it becomes the wheel,
