  font in a headline or whatever, but I don't own the font - \r\nIs it legal to trace
  that headline from say a catalog or an image?\r\n\r\nDoes that fall into the category
  of piracy/theft?"

    tracing, digitizing and cleaning up an outline, vs. $25 for a font that will last
    forever and has better outlines and default spacing than your effort.\r\n"

  body: Hmmm...I feel like it's not since if it's offered.  Fonts are everywhere,
    and it's hard to trace the copyrighting of them.

    acceptable. But as Simon noted, this is not going to save you any money if you\u2019re
    doing commercial work."

    is an Arabic font, and due to, ahem, supply-demand issues,\r\nit costs 250 Euros
    (for 1 weight, the whole set costs close to 800 Euros, I only need 4 characters)\r\n\r\nKhaled,
    Thanks ), i've been there and i was just questioning this particular action,\r\nI
    know very well what piracy is, just got stuck with this one...\r\n\r\nDTF, Thanks
    for that pat on the back )"

  body: If it were illegal or unethical, then I think there's a group of companies
    who owe Claude Garamond's descendants some money. They're called font forgeries,
    or by some senior members here, 'interpretations'. You can trace the artwork in
    Illustrator, and export to Fontlab. You can't give it the same name however, or
    say that its based on font x by somebody. That's how Richard Kegler stays in business.
    Just be sure that you save your file someplace, in case anyone desperate for money
    comes around looking for an easy frivolous lawsuit.

  body: "In the U.S. the font is not copyrighted, so it's legal, unless it's patented
    (which is highly unlikely). In other countries, if it's copyrighted it's illegal.
    \r\n\r\nSo, in the U.S. it's legal - technically, unless they actually take you
    to court which they won't, but also unethical. \r\n\r\nIf the font designer states
    in the font's license that it's okay to trace it and do that, then it's okay,
    but that would be highly unusual for an artist to not care if his work is copied.\r\n\r\nNot
    to sound unethical, but hypothetically, if you really wanted to you could just
    do it, and wait to hear from the font's designer. They may tell you to pay them
    for the usage and then you pay them for it. As a font designer though, I think
    that kind of thing is totally immoral, especially if you can totally afford to
    buy the font in the first place.\r\n\r\n"
