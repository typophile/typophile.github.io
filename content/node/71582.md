body: "There are some type rasterizing options on Photoshop.\r\nAnd it is usually
  for anti-aliasing(smoothing), and it makes a difference between hinted result and
  smoothed result.\r\n\r\nDoes Photoshop do anti-aliasing with TTF hinting result
  if the font has hinting instructions?\r\nOr does it reject all the TTF hinting?\r\n\r\nThough
  I have tried searching it in the web, I couldn't find it at all;\r\nIs there any
  helpful topic for it? If so, please let me know it.\r\nOr if there's anyone who
  knows the relation between TTF hinting and Photoshop's smoothing, please let me
  know it."
