<p>I would be very appreciative for any ideas of the approximate age of this label.  I notice the text is different from the background, and the background is not plain as I would have expected but dotted upon close magnification, whereas the text is solid by comparison.  Thank you for your thoughts.</p>

Yes this is from my favourite violin.  If it were a Guiseppe Guadagnini it would be worth minimum 6 figures. (His father&rsquo;s are upwards of $1,000,000). The complete label on this violin suggests an apprentice to Guiseppe, Felice Beretta which would fetch $50,000.  The luthier friend who sold it to me is truly convinced it is a genuine label, but I had my doubts based on the style of the violin and I bought it as an unknown fake strictly for the sound at a dirt cheap price.
Oldnick, I have heard the term halftone before (but as a non print person remembered the phrase as half duplex - no wonder I couldn&rsquo;t get any decent info).<br>
The interesting thing is that there are repair marks which indicate a manufacture prior to 1850 (replacement and angle change of neck to accommodate pitch change at that time) so I was hoping the label might have dated as far back as say 1840 and hence be an &ldquo;original fake&rdquo;.  Dendrochronology if it is to be believed has pegged the instrument no earlier than 1820 plus time to age the wood.
The other clue I have which supports JamesM theory is that I have in fact seen on eBay what appears to be an identical label but in much better condition.  That violin sold for less than $1000 before I came upon mine, so I have been unable to study it further as the listing was removed. 
In general the condition of the violin suggests a very great age with repairs done by many generations of luthiers of varying talents.  The average condition of a decent fiddle from 1830-1850 is much better. So it must have been well used.
So considering everything plus other theories and style, my guess is 1835-1840 violin,antiqued a bit to pass it off as an earlier work, from a workshop of some quality, bordering northern Italy with French and Austrian influence,  and a label inserted after 1870 by a dealer who looked at the violin and thought he could profit with a better label.
Well it has always been a dream to own a great Italian violin. But of course to a player it all comes down to quality reproduction of sound and if I have that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where it originates.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
