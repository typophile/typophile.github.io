  body: 'As previously suggested by monmeehan and probably too much obvious, I would
    have said [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/myriad/|Myriad]] (Semi Extended
    Light). I assume [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/bitmaps_are_so_2011.php|the
    official former logo was set in Myriad]]. Makes me also thinking to [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331|Segoe]]
    (could be the one if these captures come are related with Windows Mobile). Another
    similar is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/interval-sans-pro/|Interval
    Sans]]. '
