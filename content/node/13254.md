  text. I just started looking and I have found the Epson Stylus Photo R1800. I am
  a freelance designer working from home so money is tight, but need a solid printer
  for client reviews.\r\nAny responses would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nTommy"

  body: "I've gone through a number of cheap inkjets and haven't found anything that
    comes close to epson for final prints or proofs. Their ink quality and the colors
    are just way better than anything else I've found. Like any inkjet, they have
    a number of issues to be aware of. \r\n\r\nThe most important problem is that
    the nozzles can clog and render the printer useless. This is best addressed by
    turning the printer off when it's not being used. \r\n\r\nThe other, more immediate
    and chronic issue is the cost of the black ink. Personally, I have a little $60
    Canon that I use for utility printing and save the Epson for when it counts. \r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

    price point, too.

  body: Any experience with the Epson StylusRip software? Or printing from pdf. Epson
    sales is telling me the best in my price range is the 2200 with rip sofware, but
    the 2200 is discountinued so limited availibility.

    Tiger. I really don''t trust the new PPDs at all. '

  body: "I've had to go to using PowerRip third party RIP for my 3000. I've always
    found the Epson RIP fussy and a paper eater.\r\n\r\nThe 3000 needs too much attention
    with the print heads. It does, however, run banner paper which is fantastic. I'm
    cheap so I'll keep running it until it dies."
