		<div class="commentbody">It is not off topic, but I think there needs to be some clarification of terms before this argument becomes constructive. Porn, feminism, sexuality, these mean many different things to many different people. By using these words, you can't assume that people know exactly what you are talking about. There are branches of feminism that are pro-sexuality and pro-men, believe it or not, and obviously those that are against men AND porn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what exactly are we talking about here? Is all exploration of sexual identity and desire porn, and therefore does that make all people who are interested and passionate about their sexuality violaters and abusers of women's sexuality? Every type of media produced about sex is not porn. It's like trying to argue the exact nature of what art is, it's so different for so many people, unless you know exactly what people mean by saying that word, there's no point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't doubt that some forms of porn ARE abusive and degrading to women. But I would like to see some acceptance that some porn is empowering, intelligent and engaging, to both men and women, and perhaps we all need to accept that this is, like many things, not a clear, black and white issue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think it's off topic, given the topic. Personally, I'm with Zara on this one. But that's just my opinion, of course. At the same time, I consider myself strongly pro-feminist. (I used to say I was a feminist, but some folks claim that it's not possible for a male to be a feminist. Whatever.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm just suspicious of arguments that porn is degrading only to women. Sometimes I think some of that belief stems from a conservative anti-sexuality viewpoint that says women can't possibly enjoy sex as much as men. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An interesting feature of the porn industry is that if anyone is degraded, it can be argued that is at least as degrading to men as to women. Male porn actors are paid a small fraction of what the women are paid, they don't get the same kind of billing and very few become stars. And certainly what's required of the male actors is more demanding. Yet in hard core porn, they are more likely to be just mobile genitals in the movies, while the women are central characters. If women are the sexual objects of desire in porn, then men are just the desire itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, I guess I am more likely to buy an argument that porn is degrading to people in general. But even that is an oversimplification to me. What I *do* absolutely believe is that in the absence of other information and role models about sexual relationships, most porn, when viewed by people whose attitudes towards sex are not fully developed, has the potential to create unhealthy expectations and denigrate the value of emotional intimacy and love in a sexual relationship. On the plus side, most porn at least teaches that sex is fun, which is a Good Thing in my book. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably there are a lot of companies/people in the porn industry I wouldn't want to work for. But I'm pretty sure there are at least a few that I would be willing to do design work for. And almost all I'd be willing to do expert witness, document verification kinds of work for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">JFP: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder about the survey you launched? Are you in front of such dilema yourself?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, but it is something that I think about from time to time. One of the troubling aspects of the current configuration of capital is that it is very difficult to find any company that is not in some way connected, e.g. by investment, to other companies. So even if one wants to avoid working for e.g. war profiteers, one can never be certain that one is not in some way contributing to businesses that one thinks unethical. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding porn, I don't doubt that there are more and less abusive and exploitative examples and, if there is to be porn I doubt if many reasonable people would disagree that it would be better run by women and with guarantees to respect the rights and dignity of the participants. But before we start talking about some porn being 'empowering*, intelligent and engaging' we might ponder whether those things are, in fact, part of the distinction between the pornographic and the erotic. Most legal definitions of pornography centre on the functional intent, in which pornography is judged to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->solely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> intended to provoke sexual arousal, which suggests that if the intent is e.g. to intellectually engage one may already be moving beyond the merely pornographic. I think this is a useful way to look at the question, and worth maintaining rather than blurring the line between the pornographic and the erotic in a way that can only benefit the makers of degrading and exploitative material. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All that said, I'm basically in agreement with William on the characteristic nature of porn. But will add that porn is as degrading to the consumer as to the women (and men and children) who are consumed. The reduction of human beings to sexual objects of animal gratification is inherently degrading, because we are capable of &ndash; and, I would say, made for &ndash; so much more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I don't believe there is any such thing as 'empowerment': it is a jargon-driven illusion marketed to the economically, socially or politically disenfranchised to convince them that their situation is a subjective problem of self-worth, rather than an objective state of injustice. It is the language of diversion: among other things, the process by which feminism in North America has been diverted into the dead-end of identity and gender politics and away from economic and social justice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heh. Having a mother who's a sex therapist and being surrounded by lots of books on sexuality made it pretty clear (including several books on adolescent sexuality). I literally can't remember not knowing where babies come from, either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But my own experiences aside, for a very long time the predominant message about sex in the English-speaking countries was that it was dirty and sinful. I think there is still a lot of residue of that attitude around today, even though the idea of sex as pleasurable and intimate and basically &quot;good&quot; is now pretty prevalent among folks our age and younger. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the side, I do believe there is such a thing as empowerment. But I think that people are empowered either by achieving economic and social justice, or by being given access to the levers of power that will enable them to achieve that justice. But I then again, a lot of the stuff that is talked about as &quot;empowering&quot; doesn't meet my definition, and seems like a diversion to me, too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

The USA has always been a country of extremes, and the tendency, in sex as in much else, is to exchange one set of extremes for another: puritanism for license, perpetuated by the fact that 'sex sells'. And, of course, anyone who even suggests that there might be some appropriate balance is will be accused of being censorious, of denying 'expression', etc. by people who willfully ignore the great emotional and physical misery that ensues from treating people as objects.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Well, that's what Protestantism gets you  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, John, the view of sex as inherently sinful is mainstream traditional Christian, including Catholic. To start with you have Saint Paul saying that celebacy is spiritually superior. Then you have for example, Augustine: &quot;A good Christian is bound to love in one and the same woman [his wife] the creature of God whom he desired to be transformed and renewed, but to hate in her the corruptible and mortal conjugal connection, sexual intercourse and all that pertains to her as a wife.&quot; [De Sermone Dom. in Monte, 41.] And Pope Gregory the Great &quot;Sensual pleasure can never be without sin.&quot; And even in the current Catholic Church many view sex within marriage as &quot;mere tolerated in view of procreation (New Catholic Encyclopaedia, Annual 1988, p 414) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a long Christian tradition of seeing the body as corrupt, and sexual desire as inherently sinful.

My views are informed by Jewish views of sexuality, which are at odds with Christian ones, but I also object to traditional Jewish views where I think they are at odds with human wellbeing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My objections to Zara's views, and sexual modernism, have to do with their very harmful effect on human happiness, and in particular leading to the destruction of love.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;the view of sex as inherently sinful is mainstream traditional Christian&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, even noting that you ignored my ironical smiley, this is a gross simplification. The tension between the flesh and the spirit necessarily makes sex a complex issue for any religion that takes the interior life seriously. Christianity, like Judaism, puts limits on the appropriate expression of sexuality, for social, moral and spiritual reasons, limiting it to marriage, for instance, and in the case of Catholicism and Orthodoxy also affirming chastity and celibacy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as expressions of sexuality.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And yes this has sometimes led some to puritanism and a denial of all sensual pleasure, especially in that period when Greek and Roman converts imported stoicism into Christianity or, in the case of St Augustine, remnant Manichaeanism. But to cite a few readings &ndash; only one canonical and that clearly not saying that sex is inherently sinful &ndash; to suggest that this is the predominant teaching of mainstream Christianity is unfair. The wholesale condemnation of sensual pleasure has long been understood as contrary to the belief that the physical order was created by God and is fundamentally good: a basic teaching that is reaffirmed by the Magisterium when puritanism, stoicism or Manichaeanism rear their heads. What <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mainstream is the observation that lust, i.e. selfish sexual desire for physical gratification, is one of the most pervasive distractions of the spirit away from God, hence it is counted as one of the deadly sins: those sins that by habit come to replace God in the human heart. Obviously, in this perspective, sexuality that is directed toward physical gratification as its sole or primary goal &ndash; e.g. pornography &ndash; is disordered. By the same token, not everything that is erotic is pornographic or in the nature of lust. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll also note that, like most other things in North America, Catholicism here has been more touched by puritanism than in, say, Italy. A friend of mine who has led groups of North American pilgrims to Rome has observed their shock when they encounter the frankness of fleshy humanity in the paintings and statues that adorn many churches.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yes, the Church still teaches that sex is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->primarily<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ordered to procreation, and that sex from which the possibility of procreation has been deliberately removed is disordered. But it does not teach that procreation is the sole purpose of sex or of human sexuality. Rather, sex is understood to be a wholeness, involving flesh, mind and spirit open to the gifts of God, including spiritual gifts, emotional gifts and the gift of life. What is sinful is to reduce it or to subtract from it any part of that wholeness, so that it becomes a shadow of what it is meant to be. This wholeness is well expressed in the official statements of the Church, e.g. the recent Catechism: 'Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.' [Article 2332] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should note that when I talk about religion, I am not expecting anyone outside my religion to agree with me or to conform to the direct moral implications of what I believe. I'm just explaining where I'm coming from. On the other hand, I don't believe that things are immoral because the Bible or the Church teach that they are: I believe the Bible and the Church teach that they are immoral because they are immoral, and can frequently be demonstrated to be immoral on purely natural and secular grounds as causing misery, undermining social bonds, leading to illness and death, etc. I'm very well aware, having lived for many years as an atheist, that some aspects of Catholic morality make little sense 'from the outside'. That is, I wouldn't expect any non-Catholic to abide by the Church's teaching on contraception, for example. Without conversion, without first turning toward to God and seeking His will, one isn't likely to perceive the fractured, or at best partial, nature of sexuality that closes itself off to the gift of life. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My objections to Zara's views, and sexual modernism, have to do with their very harmful effect on human happiness, and in particular leading to the destruction of love.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this observation, we are completely in agreement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am never quite sure what to make of some of the fine points of the kinds of teachings tha John is citing. Often they seem like well- or thinly-disguised versions of pleasure-is-bad. Maybe I'm just projecting my prejudices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But my own view is pretty straightforward. Pleasure is inherently good&ndash;but that principle applies to everyone, and over time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, things are good that create pleasure for all affected. But short-term pleasure that causes long-term unhappiness is probably a bad idea. I think that most people have some (usually a lot of) emotional involvement in having sex, so for most people having sex with random people they've just met is a bad idea. Not because it's immoral, but because it is has a good chance of leading to unhappiness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Relatively casual sex is often a symptom of other kinds of unhappiness or insecurity or feeling unloved. This too doesn't make it bad; just an outlet or a way of trying to paper over other emotional issues. As long as it doesn't simply create more unhappiness (for example, through guilt, or feeling rejected when the casual partner doesn't remain interested), there's nothing *wrong* with it. But if you don't feel good about yourself in the first place, it sure isn't going to fill whatever void you've got. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wow, this is getting perhaps more personal than I'm used to in a public forum&hellip; and I've got to get to bed anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

The desire for sensual pleasure is very strong in most people, so if an individual is serious about developing the inner life, some measure of denial and a deliberate attempt to control desire is simply necessary, not because sensual pleasure is wrong or evil or sinful, but because it gets in the way and distracts the mind from contemplation. There's nothing particularly Catholic or Christian about this; you'll find the same ideas in Buddhism and Hinduism, without any reference to the Jewish, Christian or Moslem notions of sin.

I think pleasure is inherently good, and good for all people.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your thoughts, Peter. Yes, it is getting us off topic a bit, which is a pity because it is interesting stuff. Just one comment: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If there was a religion that took seriously the need for carnal pleasure (within measure) working in harmony with a spiritual awareness/focus then I have not found one.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I think the major religions are pretty sensible about this in determining that there are circumstances in which sexuality can positively contribute to spiritual growth, especially as it relates to love and to communion with another. That phrase you use, 'within measure', seems key, as is the notion that we should make room throughout our lives for physical, intellectual and spiritual development, although the balance of focus might change as we age. I don't think it is particulary controversial to suggest that in materialist, consumerist western society, there is an emphasis on the physical to the detriment of both intellect and spirit. That, too, is anti-human.</div>

So people can, and in many places largely do, drink alcohol without the express intention of getting drunk and in moderation for the pleasures of taste, in the same way that they eat delicious food without gorging themselves to the point of vomiting. This is why alcohol is socially acceptable while most other mind altering drugs are not: no one drops MDA because they like the taste, the only reason to take it is for the psycho-chemical effects. In the same way, pornography is concerned solely with animal arousal and gratification (following the traditional and legal distinction between pornography and erotica). I think it is this crudity and reductionism that makes porn distasteful to many people, including those like me who don't believe sex is sinful and enjoy it very much, thank you.</div>

I fail to see the connection.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that one should not end the life of a human being except in extreme cases to preserve another life. I do not consider a human being in the embryonic or foetal stage to be any less a human being than an infant, a child, an adolescent, an adult or a geriatric: they are all phases through which the same individual human being, created at conception, passes so long as his or her life is not interrupted. There is no magic moment after conception when a non-human suddenly becomes a human. This is not a religious opinion: I know atheists and agnostics, including scientists and philosophers, who take the same view. Any book on human biology is likely to begin with the same observation: human life begins at conception. Hence abortion is the termination of human life. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Capital punishment is also the termination of human life, and except in extreme cases, where it might be deemed necessary to protect other life, it should not be done. Since we have the means to remove the threat of murderers to society by locking them up, there is no good reason to kill them. Capital punishment in such circumstances is, fundamentally, a statement of despair: a refusal to allow for hope and grace. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I put abortion and capital punishment side-by-side deliberately, because in political discourse, especially in the USA, they tend to get separated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, do you honestly know anybody who found wine, beer or scotch to taste good the first time they tried it? It seems to me that these are acquired tastes, and the primary reason they are acquired is because of the effects of the alcohol in them. Otherwise, a lot more effort would go into perfecting non-alcoholic beer.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Labeling arousal and gratification for their own sake as &quot;animal&quot; is exactly the kind of denigration of physical pleasure I'm concerned about. We celebrate many wonders and pleasures we share with other creatures that are pretty basic physical experiences, even having children. Food and drink don't have to have non-sensual artistic or philosophical value to be appreciated. Yet somehow sex is different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The big difference is that sex is a more powerful physical experience than the rest. Outside of certain drugs, it is the greatest of earthly pleasures. Unless one centers a religion around it, it clearly threatens the primacy of religion. Maybe that's the underlying reason why so many religions try to put sexuality in as restrictive a box as possible, to try to minimize how big a part of life it can be for people&ndash;make it less important to their happiness, and the religion more important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your apology for Christian views isn't traditional Christian, including Catholic. Here is St. Thomas in the Summa Theologica, clearly saying that if you have sex with your wife for the sake of pleasure, you are committing a sin:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;For if the motive for the marriage act be a virtue, whether of justice that they may render the debt, or of religion, that they may beget children for the worship of God, it is meritorious. But if the motive be lust, yet not excluding the marriage blessings, namely that he would by no means be willing to go to another woman, it is a venial sin; while if he exclude the marriage blessings, so as to be disposed to act in like manner with any woman, it is a mortal sin.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The modernist reaction against Christianity was for a good reason. The current attempts to paint Christianity as not having a significant hostile streak toward sexual desire are just historically false, including your effort John.    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;especially the Abrahamic ones <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter, the traditional views of Judaism, particularly within the Talmud, are radically different from the Christian ones. For example, here is Rabbi Akiva: &quot;When the husband and wife are worthy the shechinah [Divine Presence] abides with them.&quot; (Sota 17b) Marriage and procreation are seen as divine commandments, and hence voluntary celibacy as a sin. Furthermore, for a man to sexually please his wife regularly is mandatory, even when there is no possibility of procreation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The views of Jewish thinkers over the millenia changed, and under the influence of Christian Europe became more prudish than in the Talmud.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;pleasure is inherently good <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomas, your view is close to the Hedonist view that pleasure is the only good. But the Hedonist view is not psychologically sound, because pleasure, happiness and fulfillment are all different, overlaping things, and thinking of them as only one variable is a very serious blunder that has disasterous consequences. To quote Cheryl Crowe: &quot;If it feels so good, how can it be bad? If it feels so good, why am I so sad?&quot; The pursuit of pleasure can be destructive of happiness, and this is what traditional religions have understood well, and modernism has been fundamentally misguided in ignoring.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I'm making no effort at all to counter St Thomas: I think he's absolutely right. He's saying that lust can occur in marriage, i.e. that the state of matrimony is not some magical protection against lust, as some Christians have treated it. Lust is selfish desire, which treats the other person as an object for physical gratification. So lust in marriage is a sin, just as it is outside of marriage, because it dehumanises and reduces sex to a merely physical act. The sinfulness is in the objectification and absence of virtue, not in the pleasure. If the pleasure is mutual, and not selfish and objectifying, it is not lust. St Thomas is making a charitable and pastoral concession though, by noting that lust within marriage is a lesser sin than adultery. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, for a man to sexually please his wife regularly is mandatory, even when there is no possibility of procreation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that's an excellent teaching. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that the Church teaches that sex when there is no natural possibility of procreation is not a sin; what it proscribes is deliberate contraception, i.e. the artificial prevention of the natural possibility of procreation. This is, indeed, a recent clarification, and yes, there are some Catholics and other Christians who disagree with this. The Magisterium is quite clear however: 'Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the objective criteria of morality. These methods respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, and favour the education of an authentic freedom.' [Cathechism of the Catholic Church, Article 2370.] That last comment, regarding 'authentic freedom' &ndash; as against the false liberty of taking a pill to get rid of consequences &ndash; is to me one of the most attractive aspects of Catholic teaching on sexuality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I understand it, the traditional teaching of Judaism also opposes contraception as being contrary to the mitzvah to be fertile and increase, especially when it is employed for selfish purposes. Apparently some forms of contraception are permitted in family planning, though, if the couple do intend to have children. Is this correct?</div>
