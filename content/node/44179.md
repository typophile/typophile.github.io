  celebration book range.\r\nCan anyone tell me what the Font is and if there is a
  similar free font.  Also, are all the fonts on this cover the same?  It is mainly
  the font for \"Jonathan Safran Foer\" that i am interested in\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  in advance for any advice you can offer.\r\n\r\nLaura[img:sites/default/files/old-images/illuminated_5053.jpg]"
