body: 'Okay this is my first post in the critique section so I&#39;m not too sure
  <BR>how people work with attachments, I&#39;m guessing a PDF will be fine. <BR>
  <BR>This is a project I&#39;m doing in school in a typographic experimentation <BR>class.
  The typography itself is not really experimental but it&#39;s more <BR>conceptual.
  The text speaks about the page &#40;or sheet&#41;, at first in a <BR>very mathematical
  way and in the end it becomes an excuse for <BR>imaginary travel. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  not sure how to say this in english but it&#39;s contained in itself, <BR>at first
  the author writes : <BR> <BR>I&#39;m writing... <BR>I&#39;m writing : I&#39;m writing...
  <BR>I&#39;m writing : &#34;I&#39;m writing...&#34; <BR>I&#39;m writing that I&#39;m
  writing... <BR> <BR>For this reason, I gave a shot at Courier because it really
  conveys <BR>that typewriter feel and also because I wanted to work the typography
  <BR>in depth &#40;I&#39;ve already tweaked quite a bit of stuff in there&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;d like to have your opinions, suggestions on the spacing. &#40;And more
  <BR>if you want / can read the text!&#41; <BR> <BR>By the way, some paragraphs are
  upside down because this is meant to <BR>be folded. If anyone feels like giving
  it a shot, here are the <BR>simplified translated instructions -- <BR> <BR>1 : Fold
  <BR>2 : Flip <BR>3 : Fold corner / <BR>4 : Fold right corner too <BR>5 : Fold one
  part <BR>6 : Flip <BR>7 : Fold one part <BR>8 : Open and flatten <BR>9 : Fold one
  part <BR>10 : Fold one part <BR>11 : Open and flatten <BR>12 : Pull here. <BR> <BR>Emilie

  body: Hi Marcio, <BR> <BR>It would be better to start a new thread since this is
    not related to what I initially posted. But maybe it will attract attention to
    my first post so it doesn&#39;t matter anyways =&#41; <BR> <BR>Em
