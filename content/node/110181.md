  body: Thanks, Ryuk. I was hoping for something a little bit more elegant than Railhead,
    if it's out there.

  body: Hmm .. I took more elegant to mean less flashy. Hopefully Lu will clarify.

  body: "Hi Mike, I agree a little clarification by Lu of \"elegant\" would be helpful.
    The Victorians loved to make Tuscan fonts like Lu's example with amazing amounts
    of ornament and encrustation. Michael Hagemann's digitizations are well engineered
    and have a clean look not found in most other digital versions, which are usually
    autoscans with little editing. It is possible to prune some of the ornamentation
    to make something more streamlined. Kills the authenticity, but might be suitable.\r\nDon"

  body: "Good find Zoya! Definitely the closest digital so far. Seems to me that maker
    of the old font in the image and Monogram Fonts Co. designer Brian Bonislawsky
    may have both based their typeface designs on the \u201CPearl\u201D letterset
    of 1854 by George J. Becker, cited by Monogram as their source.\r\nBecker's Pearl:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BeckerPeal1854SM_6437.jpg]\r\nA
    digital version of Becker's Book is available at archive.org\r\nhttps://archive.org/details/ahn2554.0001.001.umich.edu\r\nA
    final word. Tuscan designs like this were a dime a dozen circa 1850. Other designers
    could have independently created something virtually identical using one of the
    various Tuscan design formulas then in use. But the Monogram digital is probably
    the closest we will find to a digital version of the image.\r\nDon"
