  body: email David Carson, this is probably his handiwork. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure
    he&#39;ll return the email promptly. <BR> <BR>The Eddie Aikau type is probably
    custom. <BR>Carson &#40;<a href="http://www.davidcarsondesign.com" target="_blank">www.davidcarsondesign.com</a>&#41;
    <BR>has used that quite a bit lately in <BR>Quik&#39;s branding. <BR> <BR>Customized
    Clarendon? <BR> <BR>the Big Wave type seems DIN-related.

    target="_blank"> DIN 1451 Mittelschrift</a>. <BR> <BR>I think &#34;Eddie Aikau&#34;
    &#34;invitational&#34; is not custom but  <BR>an existing typeface. The lc &#34;a&#34;
    looks familiar. Let  <BR>the hunt commence...'

  body: The k reminds me of walbaum, the horizontal bar is a distinctive feature of
    walbaum but I cannot find a sample that is quite as bold or slabby.

  body: I guess the clarendonesque typeface is something exclusively licensed to Carson.
    <BR>And IIRC, the sans at the bottom &#40;&#39;waimea bay, hawaii&#39;&#41;, designed
    by Miles Newlyn, is called Neulin Sans... I think you&#39;ll find the credits
    for the clarendonesque in Carson&#39;s &#39;Revised Edition&#39;.
