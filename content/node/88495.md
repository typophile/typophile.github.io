  see this cartoon, do you place yourself in the cartoon world? Does your brain translate
  the hand-drawn words with a modern typeface? If so, I'd say your brain is justified,
  because the context of the whole piece seems to translate a wide range of typefaces
  into cartoon script. \r\n\r\nBut I'm wondering if there are brains out there that
  work a little differently, and instead interpret the new branding as \"from now
  on, every product will be branded with hand-written letters that look like a child
  drew them.\" "

  body: I think it's pretty clear to anyone that the labels are meant to be typeset.
    Especially for anyone who's familiar with xkcd, where Randall habitually hand-letters
    recognizable pieces of typography like Wikipedia templates.

    to out-design each other that they blow past the basic, minimalist approach. Their
    attempt to stand out has resulted in a confusing mess in which no one stands out.
    \r\n\r\nUnderstandable from a cartoonist who draws mostly stick figures. \r\n\r\nHe's
    [[http://images.google.com/images?q=no+name+brands|not the first to have this
    idea]], but that's neither here nor there. "

  body: 'I''ve often had this thought myself. It would be fantastic to do a line of
    products with just the basic name of the product printed in black in Times Roman
    on a white paper bag or box or can. They would look very suspicious, but certainly
    eye-catching. Imagine one in the kids'' cereal aisle, amidst all the cartoony
    packages. This is, in fact, an extreme example of the approach taken by healthfood/organic
    cereals to differentiate themselves from the typical junky cereals. '

    and mainly natural things, labeled exactly the same way. I believe it''s packaged
    by a place called Homey Hearth. It''s all just set in an OCR font with the barcode,
    as above. I like to snack on some of the stuff they have, like dried salted peas
    & cinnamon sticks (the sweeter Vietnamese kind). '

    choice however would give a customer no additional information about a product,
    if it would be premium or cheap, it does not translate an emotion. Interesting
    question weather or not one can do that solely with typography in this restricted
    setting. "

    bare-bones, generic packaging indicates a product whose main selling point is
    low price. \r\n\r\nTheir assumption might be right or wrong, but I think that's
    what most folks would think unless they had  a reason to believe otherwise."

  body: Generic packaging had a mid-life crisis several years ago.  It also looked
    too much like military packaging or Govt. issue food products pre-food Stamp era.
    Like anything else that gets overused and neutered, it fails with time.

  body: "The <em>President\u2019s Choice</em> brand (that name wouldn\u2019t fly in
    the US!) is a Loblaw\u2019s (Canada) house brand.\r\nWith close cropped product
    shots on a white package, and plain all-cap sans type, it has a minimalist look,
    but not generic or cheap. The discreet logo, the small size of the type and the
    nice art direction (photographed on white with vignetted shadow) give it sophistication.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pc-appetizers_5133.jpg]\r\n\r\nLoblaws
    still carries the <em>no name</em> brand, so the contrast between all lower case
    and all caps serves to differentiate the brands, as does the choice of colour,
    which comes into play much more in this kind of pared-down layout. \r\n\r\nThere
    is also the<em> Blue Menu</em> house brand:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presidents-Choice-Thin-Bagels-300x300_6429.jpg]\r\n\r\nWould

    styling to help shoppers tell the languages apart :-)"
