  body: You could ask them which font they&#39;re using to view the txt files. It
    may be a special hack-encoded font to get around some limitation in the DB. Can&#39;t
    think of another reason why this would be broken in this day and age.

  body: Thanks for the responses. <BR> <BR>Wonderful news Johnych, we were afraid
    we&#39;d lost the data. I do have one question though -- how did you get that
    to display on the screen in cyrillic?  <BR> <BR>When we view the files in notepad
    etc. all we see is the messed up code above, and when we pull it out of the database
    and display it on a web page, all we see is upside down question marks. <BR> <BR>Any
    ideas &#40;you would be lifesaving!!&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Jordan

    <BR> <BR>Shortly, you just need a font supporting Cyrillic to read the text in
    Notepad. <BR>Choose e.g. Times New Roman in Format/Font in Notepad. There is the
    Script combo box in the Font dialog. Choose Cyirillic. If there is no Cyrillic
    for Times New Roman then try other fonts or ask your client to send you a font.
    <BR>Perhaps you will need to switch on Cyrillic support in Control Panels, I don&#39;t
    know. Cannot add anything more since I use Win XP which is more language-friendly
    than 2k. <BR> <BR>By the way, all that Cyrillic text above is readable in IE under
    XP with proper language settings except letter &#34;&uuml;&#34; in 1 - '
