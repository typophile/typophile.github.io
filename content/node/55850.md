    shape, I would like to see the same kind of logic applied to the capitals too.
    \r\n- I would also try to make the foot serifs of n,m, etc. more asymmetric.\r\n-
    I think you can also try different alternatives for Q, maintaining the same concept
    of a single movement."

  body: "This is looking good! What's it for? I'm assuming text (and looking at the
    vertical metrics, I'm guessing books rather than newspapers)? It'd be great to
    have a bit more info.\r\n\r\nHere are a few comments, be sure to have salt ready.\r\n\r\nIt's
    great to see bdpq executed like this. If you don't mind telling, where do these
    come from (read, what other fonts were you looking at while making them)?\r\n\r\nI
    really like the \"a\" too &ndash; it's beautiful.\r\n\r\nI wonder about the terminals
    on the \"c\", \"f\" and \"r\" (the latter seems a bit too soft/bulbous/stubby
    in context). Have you tried using it on the \"s\" as well? Because with its rather
    long straight serifs, the \"s\" looks surprisingly hard/determined/closed in comparison.
    Then again, comparing with the caps (see below) maybe the \"s\" is cool, and it's
    that c/f/r terminal that is too soft?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the \"k\"; it
    looks beautiful by itself, but seeing it in text* I'm wondering if the leg might
    need more air.\r\n* Assuming this is meant for text.\r\n\r\nLooking at the caps:
    Is it intentional that they're notably spikier/\"harder\" than the lowercase?
    The \"C\" looks especially Dracula-esque ;-). (It might also be leaning left a
    bit.)\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something slightly lopsided about the weight/contrast
    on the \"M\". Also, the heavy diagonal of the \"A\" might be a hair heavier than
    say the one on the \"N\"?\r\n\r\nThe \"Q\" is an interesting experiment! Something
    slightly Non-Latin-looking about it. But it doesn't quite work for my eyes yet.
    It has a slightly uncomfortable lean/twist, and looks kind of large; the tail
    may also be looping up a bit too much, almost clashing with say a following \"u\".\r\n\r\n\"T\"
    might be a bit wide? Also, I think your \"To\" is overkerned.\r\n\r\n\"W\" might
    be a bit heavy (though it might just look like that on my printout), and slightly
    unbalanced.\r\n\r\nBy the way, please switch off automatic ligatures in InDesign
    when making your samples as long as you don't have any. ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm beginning
    to note some interesting stylistic confluences in the Serif board. Must be something
    in the air. :-)\r\nI'll be curious to see this progress."

    friendly and useable. I love the proportions and design. There's a nice amount
    of space overall (because I'm currently struggling with spacing in my font!).
    Your a reminds me a bit of Chaparral. \r\nThe two things that jump out at me are
    your Q and the vertical serifs. The Q I think could try a straighter southwest
    curve and tail. The vertical serifs on CEFGSTZs and z seem too straight to me,
    especially against the curves serifs of adhijklmnpqr and u. I'm not sure what
    the solution is, but perhaps they need to be wider and/or shorter?\r\nCould W
    be a touch wider or Z narrower? Could the knee of k be a bit lower? I love the
    shape.\r\nThe capitals with curves look like their sidebearings might be a bit
    wide. \r\nThe two heavy strokes of M are not balanced, I think. L looks narrow.\r\nWell
    done with this, it'll be really nice :)\r\n"

    designed the font for small sizes from about 7 to 9 points. This is the regular
    weight but maybe I should make a little lighter version and make the semibold
    versionout of this!? \r\n\r\nI wanted to achieve a calligraphic, fresh and smooth
    look but on the other hand it should have a classic and not too clean apperance.
    Fonts I looked at were mostly Rialto, Maiola, Palatino and Dolly.\r\n\r\n\"cfr\"
    have pen shaped terminals and the \"s\" have a single sided serif like in venetian
    faces. If I would change the serif of the \"s\" and make it pen shaped like \"cfr\"
    the \"z\" would be the only letter that matches the spured serifs of the capitals.

    has a better name for it. I am grateful for every suggestion."

    That reduces the x-height necessity; but your design is a bit on the narrow side.
    In my view 60-something percent is for normal text sizes (for a narrowish design).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to make this design the semibold and make a lighter regular version!?!

    Make a statement (\xE0 la Smeijers) that text fonts should be much darker than
    they are. But of course you'd have to believe that first. I actually do myself,
    but maybe not <em>that</em> dark. Or maybe yes indeed.\r\n\r\nBTW, you really
