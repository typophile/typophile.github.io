I personally despise bullet points, but I don&#39;t get to edit these texts. Any suggestions for formatting them to look their best? Currently, I have the bullet at the left margin edge, then a tab, with the rest of the text lining up to that tab &#40;most of the bulleted text I work with is multiple lines&#41;. There are no paragraph spaces between items, or between the list and the text. I haven&#39;t found any examples of bulleted text that I like, so I&#39;m not sure what else to try.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really hate bullets and all they stand for: the inability to write coherent text, to express connection, or to organise a list into any order. I have a queasy suspicion that the very word &#34;bullet&#34; has coincidentally contributed to their grotesque popularity, with its connotations of deadly speed. A bullet point is not just a point: it is a killer, swift and sure and aimed at its target. <BR> <BR>I agree with those who suggest using either a midpoint or a reduced size of bullet. I would not succumb to the temptation to use some other symbol &#40;asterisks, or hyphens, or guillemets, or plus signs or whatever ...&#41; because each has its proper function, and appropriating symbols with common uses to do service in some other task causes momentary confusion. &#40;I suppose a pure ornament would not suffer from this, but it hardly solves the problem. Anyway, what has an ivy leaf got to do with anything: decorated bullets are worse.&#41; <BR> <BR>And I wouldn&#39;t dispense with the bullet altogether because I think the decision to use a bullet carries semantic weight for the writer: the writer wanted a &#34;set of bullet points&#34; &#40;that&#39;s how these people think&#41; not just a list, and if you give her/him a list you are in some sense altering the meaning of the text, subtly but perceptibly, in a way I think one normally shouldn&#39;t. At least, if you are going to do that you should go back to the writer and say &#34;These bullet points look bad, could we do ...&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I get alot of text with bullets at work as well, and I&#39;ve become convinced that copywriter&#39;s facination with bullet points can be blamed entirely on PowerPoint. <BR>Generally, I find that removing bullets altogether is the best way to handle lists. They can be unsightly and clutter the text. Set a list the same way you&#39;d set the body, and add a little leading between points &#40;if the body is 10/12, then between points in the list, put a hard break of 14 or 16&#41;. It&#39;s not great typography, but it&#39;s not great copy either.</div>
