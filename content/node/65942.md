    good/recommended books in the same general direction (how reading \"works\", hardware-wise)
    anyone?"

  body: "I get the impression from the review that Dehaene might take a more Chomskyan
    view of innateness than the reviewer does, which suggests that the entire second
    half of the review and its conclusion reflect what the reviewer thinks rather
    than what the book has to say. Well, that would suit me fine, since the second
    half of the review gets on my nerves. :)\r\n\r\nThe reviewer -- and perhaps Dehaene?
    -- presumes that the computational theory of mind is correct and describes actual
    brain activity, which seems a common presumption of cognitive psychologists these
    days. Coincidentally, I am currently reading Jerry Fodor's <em>The mind doesn't
    work that way: the scope and limits of computational psychology.</em>."

  body: "As long as we're swapping book tips - Berlow had mentioned a book on another
    thread called <em>Empires Of The Word</em> by Nicholas Ostler. Sub-titled \"A
    Language History Of The World\".\r\nTerrific. And thanks to DB for mentioning
    it. I find it hard to believe that it's the first look at human history through
    the prism of language communities, but that's what's claimed in the Introduction.\r\nIt
    also intersects with Richard Dawson's idea of memes - ideas and, I believe, possibly
    the languages that express them  - that replicate from mind to mind and are therefore
    subject to a kind of natural selection. Some survive, some don't.\r\n\r\nNow,
    off to check Christopher's link..."
