  body: "Glad to help, but I'll tell you how I found it, so you'll see it's no magic
    trick -- I typed 'brush script' into the MyFonts.com Search window, and then I
    put 'galerie du maroc' as the Sample Text. I set the number of Results per page
    to 96, and there was 'Majidah' as number 65, looking just like your sample. It
    doesn't always work so well, but very often it does.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
