  a highly interesting old typeface called Antique Old Style No. 3, which has no descenders
  at all. More precisely, the descenders of f, g, j, p, q, y in Roman and Italic are
  sqeezed or crippled such that they do not (or almost not) go below the base line
  enabling extremely non-leaded typesetting.\r\n\r\nI uploaded a sample page here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/luke.gif\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to me that this KJV Bible edition, which is a reprint, was originally typeset
  using the foundry type or hot-metal type of Antique Old Style No. 3, which seems
  to be a modification of one of the various Bookman fonts.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is this
  curious Antique Old Style No. 3 available as a digital font?\r\n"
