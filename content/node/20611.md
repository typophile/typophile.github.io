  body: It's a kind of copyright, only Scottish produced can be labeled as Whisky.

  body: Most of these labels are hand scripted. This is a standard copperplate style.
    You'll probably never match it, but all those fonts come close, including <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=SG.118958.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=ChoiceOldScotchWhisky&sampleSize=45">Artscript</a>.
