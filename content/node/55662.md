  use having moved to digital letterpress for its flexibility.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if there was any problem with digitizing what type I have for personal use (that
  is to say I wouldn't be selling it).\r\nMy gut tells me there isn't a problem, but
  in these sort of cases I'm almost always wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\njr"

    selling them."

    is \"digital letterpress\"? I'm very curious\u2026\r\n"

  body: most metal faces have been digitized by now. You can probably find them available
    for sale at various digital foundries.

  body: "@piccic The term is a bit of a misnomer, as all the typesetting (what really
    makes letterpress) is done in the program of choice, using whatever digital typefaces
    are on hand. Graphics can be added, the whole thing is exported to .eps or .pdf
    and made into photopolymer plates which are then mounted on a type high base and
    printed using old presses that would otherwise go unused.\r\n\r\nMy thinking was:
    since I own these typefaces, for example News Gothic in 10pts, in their original
    castings, which all pre-date microcircuitry, I should have some right to digitize
    it myself provided I don't try to rebrand or sell it. Otherwise I'm just stuck
    with 15lbs of News Gothic in 10pts."

  body: Even if the typeface designs were subject to US copyright law most weights
    of News Gothic would already have been in the public domain for decades. And given
    the state of the News Gothic market, it seems that the trademarks are a non-issue
    as well.

    with the ruler and display (like 36\u201348 pt) hand type, then ink it and proof
    it. That was fantastic fun. Next week, they brought us a book page each, and untied
    the string holding the thing together: 2000-odd small pieces of metal, to be sorted
    into their little compartments in the cases. Thanks gods for the computer!\r\nBut
    I digress, oops."

    can digitize whatever US metal typefaces you like. Haven't all the major and minor
    digital type foundries? Only thing you have to worry about is registration or
    trademark licenses that may still be valid. And most of those protect stolen property.
    Nice industry.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Besides, you could end up with a more interesting digital version than the
    ones around, like what Metallophile by Mark Simonson does to (digital versions
    of) Spartan.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that irregularity should be the norm, but often
    digital versions totally lack the warm appearance and consistency of metal ones,
    especially at small sizes, but this largely depends on the design itself.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I am not at all satisifed by all current Gill Sans versions on the market: too
    little spaced, mostly without any optical size versions, disregarding its original
    conception.\r\nEven the Monotype \"Pro\" version of which I licensed a weight
    is so tightly spaced you should manually space it to set small point sizes."
