  text. I want use it for my portfolio but I'm not a big fan of geometric san serifs
  for use in body copy thus am not confidant in using it. \r\n\r\nAlternatively I'm
  gonna use Akzidenz or Feijoa. "

  body: "AG, Gotham, NO. Feijoa, YES!\r\n\r\nThe sans faces you mention are general
    purpose and can be used for short bits of copy, not too small. Feijoa was built
    to be used at small sizes for long texts. "
