<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>well, it says "anything goes" and since people do seem to enjoy one or the other non-quite-type-related-thread on this board, i was wondering, what liquid goes best with designing typefaces. it's a personal choice, of course, which might make this thread as interesting as "What's your desk, studio etc look like?". at least i hope so. <br>for me it's basically fresh ground italian coffee (Saquella) and natural french mineral water (Vittel) during the day. but if i'm still in front of the screen after the sun has left the building, i tend to grab something "more enlightening". in my case that would be either beer from eastern europe (Budweiser or Pilsner Urquell) or red wine from spain or preferably from northern italy, depending on the weather and mood. btw, i'm german and live and work in hamburg, so my poison is not as sophisticated as it might look to people on "the other side of the pond".</div>

<div class=commentbody>Years ago, at my first ATypI conference, Dave Farey explained to me the correlation between the italic slant angle and the number of glasses of wine consumed by the designer. <br> <br>During the day, I usually have a glass of water handy (next to the bag of double salt licorice -- they sort of cancel each other out in the system), but in the evening a glass of wine is not uncommon (usually a shiraz or shiraz blend, usually Australian), and if I'm still working at a later hour I have a scotch (usually Lagavulin, always single malt, never less than 12 years old - because some snobbery is good snobbery). I tend not to drink coffee while I'm actually working: if I need to stay up all night to meet a deadline, I find chocolate covered espresso beans to be more effective. But coffee is <i>very</i> important in other ways, so once or twice a day I leave my desk and walk to <a href=http://www.caffeartigiano.com/>this place</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Depends. I like a good beer while I'm working -- a Flying Dog Pale Ale or a Sam Adams Summer Ale. Not enough to get drunk, just enough to work up a light buzz and get the brain loosened up. <br> <br>When avoiding alcohol, I drink water or Mt. Dew.</div>

<div class=commentbody>During the day, at the office: copious amounts of Hinckley Springs water and equal amounts of some wretched institutional coffee or other. <br> <br>At night, at home (or with the laptop out and about) it's generally booze, punctuated by periodic intakes of water. Scotch rocks is the perennial favorite. Arbeg, Laphroaig, or Lagavulin (in order of preference) are the favorites. Usually it ends up being something like Dewar's or Ballantine's however. Unlike the esteemed Mr. Hudson, I prefer the 10 year Laphroaig to the 15. <br> <br>Beer comes in a close second. Old Style (the mainstay of Chicago) tops the list. Singha takes silver, with anything Polish (Tyskie, Dojlidy, Okocim) going home with bronze. <br> <br>And since I hear it's better for the ticker, I'll throw an odd bottle of wine in here and there. Typically Chileans (Gato Negro or Concha y Toro). I finally gave up my grad school obsession with 3-liter screw-top jugs of Livingston Cellars ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I suppose I'm gonna bore everybody out of his/her skull, <br>but a liter of finest Earl Grey in the morning and sparkling <br>water after that will get me through my working day. I <br>guess we've got at least one thing in common, Hrant <br>(although my water comes from a glass bottle). <br> <br>I also picked up the habit to eat three to four pieces of <br>fruit a day while working since I decided to ditch the <br>"cooky diet" I was on a couple of years ago. It worried <br>me that some of my colleagues had taken to calling me <br>"Cooky Monster"... The fruit is just as tasteful, but I'm <br>a bit worried about those darn vitamins and dietary fibers. <br> <br>If I have to work nights, it's mostly (Lipton) Ice Tea, <br>grenadine with fizzy water, or ice-cold <i>menthe </div>

<div class=commentbody>>"It's OK Beer". <br> <br>Last time I was in Poland, I still saw that. But that was five years ago. At the market I go to in Chicago, the advertising is minimal - most of the beer's sitting in cardboard boxes. Frankly I prefer Okocim's Porter - Dojlidy beats their lager hands down. Okocim Mocne is quite a drink too - and packs quite a punch. The other Polish brew I like, my favorite in fact but which I can't find anywhere in Chicago, is Kosher. And oddly un-Polish spelling.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm curious if I'm the only one here with a habit of stuffing myself with excitants and <br>relaxants at once. My drinks of choice when drawing type are coffee (drip, black as sin, <br>no sugar, no cream) and a beer (newcastle, alaska amber, anchor steam, &c). The trick <br>is to drink them both at the same time, so as to balance the effects of each, and the <br>outcome is an openness to ideas, courtesy of the beer, and a motivation to get lots <br>done, thanks to the caffiene.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>excitants and relaxants at once. <br> <br>Ah, a like mind. That was my dietary strategy for about two years. When I wasn't drinking screw-top wine anyway. It does work wonders - the beer counteracts the jitters from overly strong coffee and the coffee kept me from the lure of sleep due to the beer. Unfortunately my beer wasn't so rich in taste. I had just moved from Tennessee, so I was still drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon.

I wait from 9 to 13 to drink water during my lunch in my house, in the other side of my small garden. Same for afternoon, I wait the dinner. <br> <br>Perhaps? my "poisons" are: For lunch, I generally eat fresh tomatoes with basil and a good olive Oil and pepper: close to everyday during the week, along the year. Dark chocolate is always take at the end of any lunch or dinner. <br> <br>But, sometimes, I take a glass of "Danao," a Danone drink based of a mixture of fruits and milk in the afternoon. <br> <br>Wine is served here only when we receive friends/family. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>If I am designing or writing I try not to imbibe any mind altering substances, even chocolate is out. So its water (fizzy or still), various "British" or fruit teas, or bizarre non-cow milkshakes (So Good or Provamel). <br> <br>Its a different matter otherwise though. Wheat/White beers are always good (and if Yves wants to send over some bottles of Dentegems then he can have my hand in marriage), as is new world white wines, and my personal favourite, Bombay Sapphire gin, ice, tonic, and a slice of lemon. <br> <br>My dirty secret is diet coke.

<div class=commentbody>Vincent, I'm fond of Pyramid Apricot Ale, too -- though I think of it as a girly-beer. (Girly-beers are the only kind I like.)

<div class=commentbody>> absinthe and laudanum <br> <br>Ah, our Baudelaire has come forth! ;-) <br> <br>BTW, you've reminded of something strange that happened to me about 10 years ago. I was on my Amiga 500 (running Fog 3.1 under MacOS emulation) in my little appartment in Barcelona, designing a geometric Armenian font (hey, I was young) deep into the night, when, under the influence of nothing but sleepiness, I started drifting in and out of sleep, but never stopping to push the beziers. Finally I had to stop, and barely managed to crawl into bed, but not before I hit Save and shut down. The next morning I went back to the font, and saw a really strange Jeh indeed... It was partly garbled, but somehow it still must've made sense, in some ethereal dimension. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have a source for the real thing, although I've only tried it once. It really isn't a strong hallucinogen, as many people believe, unless you were to drink a lot of it (I had about two fingers, straight, and didn't see anything unusual except a man sitting next to me playing a ukelele, but he turned out to be real). The impressive thing about absinthe is the apparently perfect balance of the depressives in the alcohol with the stimulants in the wormwood. <br> <br>You can make your own laudanum very easily if you have the poppies. A lot of perfectly respectable people in Victorian England made their own. <br> <br>I should point out that I'm not a drug user, and never drink with the intention of getting drunk. Just in case anyone was wondering.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't drink. <br> <br>But in my previous incarnation "I never used sobriety as a crutch." <br> <br>I saw nothing wrong with drinking . . <br> <br>"A litre of wine <br>before the crew at nine. <br>That's what great typographers are made of." <br> <br>Don't believe that if you quit drinking you will save a lot of money. You won't. <br> <br>You know how they say. "Oh he is a completely different person when he is sober." You bet, I was nice drunk and a you know what now! At least that's what some think. <br> <br>I never drove a car "legally sober" until I was 45 years of age. Not a single infraction, never charged with drinking and driving. I drive better drunk than most sober. I should not be allowed to drive "unless I am under the influence of alcohol". <br> <br>So what do I drink now? Piss and vinegar! <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>A pub in the university district of Bristol used to offer a 'get drunk quickly and cheaply' special: a pint mug, half beer and half cheap, low quality port. Certainly disgusting, but probably effective. <br> <br>Mind you, in the same fair city I made the mistake of having half a pint -- <i>just half a pint!</i> -- of exhibition scrumpy at lunch time and had to go home and sleep the rest of the afternoon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>a 'get drunk quickly and cheaply' special <br> <br>Reminds me of a shop in Nottingham about 15 years ago called 'Cheapest fags and booze in town' <br> <br>>>a pint mug, half beer and half cheap, low quality port <br> <br>Years ago we used to drink half bitter, half ginger wine - that works well in the 'get drunk quickly and cheaply' stakes. <br>Recently I've come across 'Turbo Shandy' - half a pint of Nelson and half of Bacardi Breezer, but it just seems like a waste of good lager to me as Bacardi Breezer is only 5% anyway - you might as well just drink a pint of the lager.</div>

<div class=commentbody>i once visited a friend who was studying at the american college of switzerland in leysin. on a saturday we visited a bar nearby, where they celebrated a game called blatterbuster. <br> <br>the rules are simple: everybody gets free beer until the first person either leaves the bar or goes to the bathroom. definately a very cheap way to get drunk, but the pain ... especially since a bunch of very big guys from the college were guarding the doors.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm almost entirely off caffeine these days. Mind you, conferences are one of the few times I'll indulge--gotta deal with the lack of sleep somehow! <br> <br>Outside of that environment, caffeine free diet Dr. Pepper is a favorite, when I can find it. Although I like Guinness straight up, I'm also partial to a 3:2 mix of Guinness and Henry Weinhard's vanilla cream soda. It's got to be really good stuff, mixing Guinness with cheap soda pop is truly awful. (Isn't that a great straight line for somebody?) <br> <br>I'm also fond of ginger beer. <br> <br>But to be honest, most of the time when doing design work, I just drink water. In general, I'm trying to be better to my poor over-abused 38-year-old body. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oops, forgot to mention I start off most every day with a double decaf espresso. I'm quite fanatical about making it as fresh as possible, so I manage to get water through the beans within 40 seconds of starting to grind them. It makes an *immense* difference in the flavor of the coffee. Apparently there are all sorts of highly volatile aromatic hydrocarbons that are vaporizing within the first couple of minutes after grinding. <br> <br>T</div>
