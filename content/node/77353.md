body: "Hi,\r\nI have some problem with metrics classes in fontlab. To illustrate this
  I will give example - I made metric class for \"H\" - ist called .HR and it describes
  the right side of \"H\". Inside class there are letters like \"I,J,N\" and so on,
  and listed here with accents like: Iacute Icircumflex Idieresis and so on. When
  I go to metrics asistance and want to apply the sidebarings for letters in calss
  with option \"use measurent line\" fontlab seems to ignore that. Lets say the Icircumflex
  after this operation should have value like -5 on the righ side but it is still
  80. Fontlab ignores the opion \"use measuring line\". Accendet characters are components,
  but even I decompose them - it still doesn't work. \r\nI dont get it. Maybe I misunderstand
  the idea of meric assistance. But I think I remember that I did this kind of things
  before and it was OK. Thanks for any help and just in case - sorry for my English."

    it.\r\nbtw. I changed \"H\" for \"I\" in class and now it works fine but I not
    shure if everything is ok - checking now, will post when finish. but after all
    this was strange."

  body: "Hi Kukam!\r\n\r\nI haven't solution about that but share the same weird bad
    experience.. FontLab is still a WIP then you will find several bugs, the good
    news is that is on working, the bad news is you will need pay again to purchase
    new version or update version. \r\n\r\nIn my experience I was indirect solve that
    trouble just restarting fontlab or rebooting my computer.\r\n\r\nAnyway FontLab
    is a great tool, but still incomplete and still imperfect (like our human being
    behaviors).\r\n\r\n=)\r\nPedro"
