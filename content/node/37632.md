  body: "As other people have noted here before, T-Star is biting Lineto's style by
    ripping off not only one font, but two: Lineto\x1D's Simple and Gravur Condensed.
    Die Gestalten have a track record of boldly going where someone else has gone
    before them, an deserve zero respect for doing so unashamedly and repeatedly.
    Fact: one of their aesthetically and economically most sucessful fonts, Blender,
    credited to Nik Thoenen, is entirely based on the actual outlines of a previous
    incarnaction of a Norm font. Like with most Gestalten products, their investment
    into content is zero, they're strictly Also-Rans, and I, for one, have a hard
    time deciding what sucks more: their fonts, or their books?"

  body: "Blender does exist in various versions and variations - as the name says:
    it has been blended, obviously - and some may now look like they are owing to
    Crouwel. But all of these are originating from a design by Norm, and that is not
    hearsay or rumour or interpretation, it is just a little-known hard fact. I wouldn't
    knock Thoenen for having done so if Blender was a font for his own work; alas,
    it is a font family published by Gestalten now, and as such we're in different
    territory.\r\nT-Star Mono is a different case, though - a conceptually lazy piece
    of work, relying on someone else's aesthetic and using their approach as a formula
    for quick success. Whether outlines have been copied or not is not the question
    here, and I wasn't saying that. I was talking about the blatant \"me too\" mentality
    of all things Gestalten that bores me out of my brain."

    there. Are you for example going to tell me that because Zuzana Licko designed
    the very first 'gi'- en 'it'-ligature in type design history (correct me if I'm
    wrong) designers like Kris Sowersby (Feijoa) and Dino dos Santos (Mus\xE9e) are
    not allowed to incorporate them into their typefaces? Or that no other distressed
    typewriter face can exist alongside FF Trixie? Or that Norm holds the sole right
    for minimalist tech sans faces with rounded finials?\r\n\r\nI'm not defending
    Die Gestalten whose lack of design ethic <em>do</em> annoy me, make no mistake.
    I'm just saying it's not as clear cut as you want to make it look. There is a
    world of grey between the black and the white."

  body: No I am not saying that, nor am I implying it. I was talking about a phenomenon
    quite specific to Gestalten. I'm all for a greyscale world, of course, or better
    still, a rainbow-coloured one, but there is a pattern there with Gestalten and
    it looks pretty black & white to me. When looked at isolatedly, both Blender and
    T-Star appear to be quite ok fonts, but that's only half of the story.

    hidden. Most Typophile users are open about their real names as they find it lends
    some credibility and accountability for the things they say. You seem to be a
    reasonable fellow, so I wonder why you wouldn't want your name known.
