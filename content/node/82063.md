  the titles of books or documents on Paul Renner. I am struggling to find information
  on him. My professor would like me to get a broad knowledge of what Renner did and
  the socio-economic conditions of his time, and I am keen to find out more about
  him too.\r\n\r\nI have only found a dissertation mainly on Futura (obviously) so
  far. I can't seem to find any informative books or journals on Renner."

  body: If you are seriously interested in Renner, there is no way around reading
    Christopher Burke's book. What about your university library and interlibrary
    loan? As to "the socio-economic conditions of his time", you may need quite some
    additional literature too. If you professor has such high expectations, perhaps
    he can give you some pointers at how to get at the relevant books.

    by the German artist and typographer Paul Renner, the Futura typeface enjoyed
    an unprecedent commercial success from its publication in 1927 by the Bauer type
    foundry. To this day it remains one of the most widely used typefaces in the world
    in every domain: advertising, publishing, signage, corporate design, etc.\r\nFutura\u2019s
    rigorous construction and functional design raised the status of the principles
    of modernism in the field of typography. It is associated with photography just
    as it was beginning to be defined as a new vector of communication and as an art.
    Futura made the golden days of the \u201Cphotomontage\u201C and responds to the
    dictates of typo-photographic composition as advocated by Moholy-Nagy. Even though
    it doesn\u2019t come from the Bauhaus, it became the emblematic typeface of the
    school of Dessau as those of Bayer and Albers. Described by the Bauer foundry
    as \u201Cthe type of today and tomorrow\u201D it looked like the perfect modern
    typeface to Jan Tschichold, Kurt Schwitters and Ladislav Sutnar, who used it widely
    throughout the 1930s, while Gebrauchsgraphik magazine chose it as its text typeface
    and it became the exclusive typeface of the Gesellschafts und Wirtschafts Museum
    of Otto Neurath in Vienna. Distributed under the name \u201CEurope\u201D in France
    by the Deberny & Peignot foundry, it is the flagship typeface of the eponymous
    Studio allotted to advertising photography, while it inspired Cassandre in his
    quest to develop a new style of lettering.\r\nThe Nazis formally imposed a return
    to blackletter letterform but the german exhibition at the Milan Triennal in 1933
    showcased the Futura typeface. In 1941, blackletters were forbidden in favor of
    roman typefaces, the Futura being designated as one of the best among them.\r\nThe
    \xAB typographic heresy\xBB of the national-socialists somewhat soiled its reputation
    and the one of its designer but the post-war economic boom and the advent of the
    international typographic style soon positioned Futura as the paradigm for the
    geometric lineals that would dominate graphic design, particularly in the domain
    of corporate design. \r\nIn Europe, Volkswagen and IKEA are outstanding and lasting
    examples, and Max H\xFCber installed it on the fa\xE7ades of the La Rinascente
    department stores. Its in the United States \u2014 where modernism have found
    refuge and where it was in use since the end of the 30\u2019s \u2014 where it
    earned its letters of nobility thanks to its use for the Sweet Catalog Files by
    Ladislav Sutnar, and thanks to the work of Bradbury Thompson and Paul Rand. Then,
    its adoption by NASA for the Apollo space program reasserted the original proclamation
    of Bauer: \"Die Schrift die Welt erobert\" set as the type of space conquest.
    \r\nThis astonishing evolution didn\u2019t escape the attention of Stanley Kubrick
    in his vision of 2001: A Space Odyssey and he utilized Futura in the credits and
    marketing materials for several of his films (notably Eyes Wide Shut).\r\nWith
    such global success, Barbara Kruger utilized it in the register of contestation
    and detournement, in the 1970s and 1980s; while the continued scope of its use
    can be seen, for instance on the advertising screens of the French and European
    TV channel Canal+.\r\nFutura has experienced an upsurge in interest over the last
    few years, notably in the corporate identities of the Seattle Public Library by
    Bruce Mau, of the Barbican Gallery in London by Cartlidge Levene and the Studio
    Myerscough, of the Mus\xE9e du Jeu de Paume by Change is Good, and of 104 by Experimental
    Jetset.\r\nFinally, it remains a major reference for typeface designers, from
    Herb Lubalin to Christian Schwarz, from Adrian Frutiger to Erik Spiekermann, who
    faced their skills against its forms to develop original typefaces (Avant-garde,
    Avenir, etc.) or interpretations mainly intended for corporate identities (Volkswagen).\r\nA
    book relating the story of the futura typeface is a real historic retrospective,
    showcasing many never published or really rare materials.\r\n"
