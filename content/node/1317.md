body: hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I am new to this discussion area but decided to give it
  a try. Here is a logo for FinnAgora. Comments are welcome. <BR> <BR>The organization
  is a Finnish Institute in Budapest. Main focus on delivering culture and science
  projets from Finland to Hungary and developing a contact network for these in Budapest.
  The main idea behind the design is a snowflake with movement. The dots create networks
  which communicate to the outside. I know typography &#40;Meta&#41; is a bit pass

  body: Terve Mikko! <BR> <BR>the logo is really elegant and simple. <BR>The type
    &#40;meta&#41; you used are appropriate  <BR>and so is the colour &#40;anyway,
    you couldn&#39;t have  <BR>much of a choise, I guess

    happy, go with it.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my problem: It&#39;s too bad so many others
    have tried this approach and done it with less skill and craft. Yours shines.
    But still, has been done. Alot. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the sour comment. <BR>Cheers

    it better &#40;I think Randy implied the same sentiment&#41;. This is a very well
    crafted design and if it were mine, I &#39;d go to print. <BR> <BR>Sorry

  body: 'Very nice, although a bit ideographic, I don&#39;t know if there is any specific
    meaning you associate with the visual sign. The light blue might prove difficult
    in print technically and also might be a problem to read in outdoor applications,
    like on posters etc, depending on the light and reading distance. Meta, imo, is
    quite unused these days, and with its heyday gone, I feel one can use it again
    without being to me-too. The fi, despite there not being a REAL ligature in the
    font itself, as Spiekerman kept the i-dot and the f apart, should be remodelled
    to a real ligature, perhaps. It would add a nice touch of individuality to the
    typography. But at the very least you should use the ligature provided with the
    Font. '

  body: My only comment is explore a horizontal format incase you run into a space
    problem. maybe have the snowflake in front of the name inbetween the two words?
    I only mention this because every logo i&#39;ve ever made had to work both vertically
    and horizontally depending on what was being printed. Dan

  body: I don&#39;t see any problem with tints. Seems like the dark blue should be
    100% black and the light about 40-50% black.  <BR> <BR>A non screened version
    would be nice for things like embossing or special application. BTW embossing
    with a 2 level die could look nice. Light blue shallow emboss. Dark blue heavier.

  body: I agree with Randy, in that the B&amp;W version will require much darker tints
    than what you can do with color. I would print no less than 30% black, but I still
    think tints are acceptable. I have been limited to 1-color &#40;black&#41; designs
    on many occasions where tints have drastically improved the versatility and appeal
    of the subject. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'He&#39;s talking about using a stroke &#40;outline, keyline&#41;, rather
    than a tint. And making the smallest circles say, .25pt and the largest ones 1.5pt.
    I don&#39;t think this will work for two reasons: <BR> <BR>1. It makes an already
    busy mark even busier. <BR>2. Ok, so you stroke the circles. Do you also stroke
    the finn? If so, what happens when the logo gets small? <BR> <BR>Better to use
    a tint.'

  body: 'I always feel that a tint can make things look a bit smudged or as if there
    is a shadow or cast, whereas a stroke, if delicately handled and considered, shows
    elements of the design to a better advantage. As for the type I would also consider
    doing finn with a stroke &#40;examine a stroke 1. As in Illustrator which expands
    both sides of the vector thereby making it larger than the other type or 2. create
    the stroke on a character then copy that character and make a mask of the stroked
    character '

  body: I had the same thing in mind as Tim concerning tints in b&amp;w version. Especially
    fax documents look blurry with tints. Here are both versions &#40;keyline and
    tint&#41; for consideration. The icon has also developed from the original version
    after few meetings with the client. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16796.gif"

  body: How much faxing does this particular company actually do, and how purposeful
    are the faxes in relation to the corporate identity. For example legal and real
    estate professions utilize faxing as a prominent means of communication, whereas,
    most retailers do little to no faxing and the faxing they do may only be internal...Not
    to say that internal identity is not important, but the perfection of logo output
    via fax may not be detrimental. <BR> <BR>If possible, I would go with the tints.
    The outlined/stroked version says bubbles or maybe I envision an automatic tennis
    ball dispenser simultaneously shooting multiple balls at my face. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: I only offer faxing as an example, other applications could be white out of
    colour, white out of an image, foil blocking, certain kinds of screen printing,
    cutting out of metal, creating gobos, watermarks, embossing and debossing. All
    of which may not be the first consideration for a logo but something which may
    well come up. <BR>However, my main objection to tints is an issue with printing
    quality.

  body: Beautifull work Mikko! <BR> <BR>Very sophisticated. Very finnish. Alltough
    the use of blue to represent Finnland seems a bit conventional to me. Propably
    a foreign person wouldn&#39;t think so. <BR> <BR>Allso it reminds a little of
    Telia logo &#40;not too much&#41;. I&#39;m not sure if Telia has used their dots
    so much after the fusion with sonera... <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to see the way it&#39;s
    used with other elements.
