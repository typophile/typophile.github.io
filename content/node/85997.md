  use this font, however I can''t seem to find the name and we need to make a decision
  soon. Image is attached. If you could help ID this font or send me a link that would
  be fantastic! If not, would it be possible to direct me to several similar fonts?
  Much thanks! '

    font,\r\nthey are just additions of the designer.\r\n\r\nSome fonts matching the
    thin-lines of your sample are:\r\n\r\nHelvetica Neue LT Std 27 Ultra Light Condensed\r\nLinotypeUnivers

    san-serif, does anyone else have any suggestions for this, or other geometric
    looking fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks Fvilanakis for your suggestions, they're nifty fonts!\r\n"
