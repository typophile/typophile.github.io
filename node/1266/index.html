<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>i made this font - a oneline font to get easy the weights from ultra thin to extrabold. for the moment, there are just the illustrator drawings, no kerning - no spacing. i just want to hear some opinions about the forms, and the mood of the alphabet. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1612.gif alt=GGrapidograph_reg.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody> Even though the face repeatedly uses some obvious devices it still lacks unity. I think the error lies not in the forms themselves, but in the counterforms they create. For example the negative space around the k has no relationship to anything else. The g has similar problems. The extension on the M also causes some awkwardness. The 5 and the G also demonstrate the same idea. While it is obvious the device used to create them, the resulting counterforms are completely inconsistent with the rest of the face. <br> <br>Another note: the tails on the lc letters feel like they are floating. Try decreasing the angle of the slant and lengthening them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>christian <br>it seems, that you think my typeface is kind of crap. but your critique was really helpful to me and i'm willing to finish the typeface anyway. <br> <br>so i change quite a lot. the lower case g and k were really strange in the kontext of a text. so i changed them to another mood. <br>also the slants of the lc letters a,b,d,u i changed so they reach the baseline. the slants of m,n,p,q,r i leave the same as they are. <br> <br>what do you think <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1623.gif alt=GGrapid_fine.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody> Thom -- I think you're going in the right direction with this typeface. The only aspect that I find jarring are the ears, such as on the r and m. For me, this is a very smooth font and I don't believe the ears add any readability. Anyone else agree or disagree? </div>

<div class=commentbody> I agree. Btw, it has an eerie familiar feeling. Anyone used those plastic stencils... uhm, hard to explain. Looks like those though, I like it. <br> <br>Btw, the new "k" is a huge improvement. </div>

<div class=commentbody>john <br> <br>i agree with you, that this is a smooth font. it was just the intention to get a bit of originality what makes me doing these ears. otherwise i'm afraid this typeface is too techno. i wanted to get a bit of a typwriter mood in it. <br>do you think these ears are disturbing the other fletters? <br> <br>and john - what do you think lc "a". i have the impression it is a bit too wide, perhaps it should be a bit more condensed..? <br>(sorry about my lousy english) <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1624.gif alt=Det_lcA.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think this a very subtle font. <br> <br>Did you try to use round ears? <br> <br>What about a solution for your 'k', which is between the 2 samples you've shown us? <br>I made a little flash-image to show you what I mean. <br> <br>Jacques <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>kkk.swf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/kkk.swf><b>kkk.swf</b></a> (&lt;1 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody> Sorry if I sounded harsh. I try to say it as I <br>see it. I do think the face has some good stuff <br>going on. I also think you are heading in the <br>right direction. Now all you need is something to <br>make the face stand out from all of the other <br>lineal geometrics out there. <br> <br>I actually think that the ears are a start in that <br>direction. When set in copy I think they give the <br>face a unique feel. They still feel a little abrupt, <br>but I think they are the key. Is there a subtle way <br>to incorporate the feel of the ears' kinked line <br>other places in the face (like the caps)? For <br>example, what if the arm of the E and the F were <br>to bend slightly? I'm just throwing out ideas now. <br>Good job. Keep it up (I don't think that it is crap. <br>Just a work in progress<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> </div>

<div class=commentbody>allright - thanks to everybody. it is good to get critique for workin hard. i'm still sitting behind the face, and made some experiments, about the ears, and found with it also a solution to change the general form - just a little bit, but with this changement, i think, i found perhaps a way to make my GGrapidograph stand out from all the other linear geometric faces out there - like christian said. <br> <br>i hope you guys are still helping me to develop my font to a good end, so i can finish it, and agree with it. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>GGrapidograph03.swf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/ggrapidograph03.swf><b>ggrapidograph03.swf</b></a> (8 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody> I suggest a merge between the lowest samples (nr 4) and the ones at the top. Just a small bend on the tails (?) would be good... </div>
