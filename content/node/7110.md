body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I thought I&#39;d start off my first post with this font identification.
  I&#39;m trying to identify the fonts from the bruce springsteen album &#34;greetings
  from Asbury Park&#34; designed by John Berg for Columbia. I&#39;m sure that the
  &#34;Asbury Park&#34; was hand drawn, but I might be wrong or someone might know
  of something similar. I couldn&#39;t identify the &#34;Greetings from&#34; at all.  <BR>
  <BR>I hope someone can help me. I did a search because I thought this might have
  been discussed before, but came up with nothing.  <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR>Brian <BR>

    has any other ideas for a font similar to the \"Asbury Park\" or \"Greetings From\"

  body: Ancient thread, I realize, but the new [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=cubano|Cubano]]
    font from Lost Type has a similar spirit to the Asbury Park. Especially if you
    put a thick stroke on it.
