body: It&#39;s a logo I plan to use in a coffee bar illustration. I haven&#39;t designed
  that yet. <BR>I guess I just wanted to mess with this first. <BR> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
  want to keep refining this if the concept has some fatal flaw I&#39;m missing. <BR>

  body: I like the &#39;Percolators&#39; part, I am not too sure about the &#39;The&#39;
    part, if this makes any sense at all.. <BR><i>&#40; &#39;The&#39; just seems too
    straight, too &#39;normal&#39;, maybe, compared to the &#39;vintage&#39;, organic
    feel of &#39;Percolators&#39;.. &#41;</i>

  body: It seems like you are cramming a literal coffee reference into the &#34;the
    P&#34; combination. It doesn&#39;t really seem necessary to have a kettle in this
    mark. Or if you want a kettle in the mark, don&#39;t hide it.
