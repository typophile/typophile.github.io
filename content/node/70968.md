  to Typhophile and I am having a bit of an internal struggle with the task in front
  of me!\r\n\r\nI am working on some logo concepts for an outdoor nightclub. The major
  overriding condition is that it has to have a neon influence. That is not particularly
  taxing, however the client is quite convinced that the lettering should be in a
  script face. The face that my client prefers is Rapier. \r\n\r\nNow this may not
  necessarily be a deal breaker either, but I find myself perplexed to find decent
  examples of this typeface used in any logos, let alone in neon. I look at this font
  and I think Pizza Hut. Not particularly modern. And the connectivity of the lettering
  does not seem to flow either. I have reduced the font down to a single stroke to
  help with legibility in the neon setting, but it just seems weak.\r\n\r\nThis logo
  will need to be used in a number of places. My biggest challenge though, is bringing
  this logo to life on a 10 foot wide arching entrance sign. Yikes!\r\n\r\nI've included
  a couple of other rough examples for comparison. What are your thoughts? Any input
  would be greatly appreciated!"

    What kind of music do they play at the club?'

    penn.and.ink! The music varies depending upon the night, but can range anywhere
    from rock to country to dj/dance music. There is a food component there also.
    I agree with you as well on the the tittles being too large on No. 3. That is
    stock NeonStream with a slight bend.\r\n"
