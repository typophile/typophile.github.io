    but it needs to be pushed further to be useful I think. But to do that you need
    to know where you want to go & why.

  body: "I like the direction you're going, but I question your decision to make the
    bottom of the uppercase letters slant up while the lowercase bottoms are nearly
    horizontal. It makes the capitals far too different from the lowercase, in my
    opinion. I'd choose one or the other to use for both uppercase and lowercase (I'd
    go with horizontal bottoms myself).\r\n\r\nIt's looking good, but it needs some
    polishing. After a quick look, the M seems overly wide and lopsided, the meeting
    point of the center and bottom stroke of the W leaves a dark spot there that unbalances
    the letter, the top of the b's bowl should be more angled to match the other lowercase
    letters, the bottom of the j is too wide, the top part of the s makes too dark
    an area (you need more white space there), and the y and z are tilting too much
    to the right. There are other issues too, most to do with consistency between
    letters and the amount of white space you use. A common suggestion is to flip
    the letters horizontally so that they form a mirror image. After doing that, you
    can more easily evaluate any weight or other problems with the letterforms. Even
    with these problems, it's looking good. Keep going."

  body: I think you could even extend the 'reverse-angle glyphs' to a whole alternate
    set of alphabet. It shouldn't be very hard to do, but you'll still have to fine-tune
    them to achieve the optimum optical balance.

    Nonetheless, the touches that you're going to put in will depend on how much 'hand

  body: "Hey Marc,\r\n\r\nRight off the bat, there's something peculiar about the
    upper left part of the <em>f</em>. The stroke doesn't start naturally. In my opinion,
    you can't simply use the stem of an <em>l</em> and the arm of an <em>r</em> to
    make an instant <em>f</em> ;-)\r\n\r\nThe <em>d</em> and <em>q</em> also look
    like mirrored <em>b</em> and <em>p</em> to my eye (you might have designed them
    differently; and if so, I apologize). As far as I know, this is not an uncommon
    practice in display faces (Alternate Gothic no. 2, for instance, use mirorred
    <em>b, d, p,</em> and <em>q</em>). But personally, I design every alphabet a little
    bit differently to not only account for its relative visual weight (this you must
    do) but also to impart subtle design touches to each one.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of
    the strokes that you draw doesn't end naturally. For instance, the end stroke
    of <em>i, h, k</em> and <em>u</em> are missing the right part of the serif. See
    below for the \"right stroke\" example (this is taken from the typeface Costa).
    Your situation is different, but I hope you can grasp the general principle of
    stroke ending by seeing it in action. I understand your intention of making this
    face a semi-serif; so, In this case, if you do add the right serif to the stroke,
    the left one can be erased and you'll still have a semi.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ihku_3759.gif]\r\n\r\nJust
    shout if you have any question. Best of luck!"

    experiment with adding/cutting the serifs until you find a combination that's

  body: "Marc,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, sorry about the long overdue reply.\r\n\r\nBut
    wow, this typeface is really shaping up to be quite nice! Some quick remarks before
    I head to bed:\r\n\r\n<ol> Love the new serif that you have at the end of <em>d</em>.
    Small, subtle touches like this is what's going to make your typeface unique,
    especially when printed large.\r\n\r\nHowever, my eyes kept on wanting to see
    a normal arm on the <em>f</em>. I think the current slanted serif design is unique,
    but for some reason, it doesn't look like a normal <em>f</em> to my eye (which
    could be good or bad). You know, kind of what Eric Gill said about \"what makes
    an <em>a</em> an <em>a</em>?\" But this point is totally subjective to me, and
    you should get other designers to view the letter and see what they think.\r\n\r\nLove
    the new <em>i</em> and its new dot\r\n\r\nSpeaking about the dot, it needs to
    be moved closer to <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>.\r\n\r\nAlso love the new <em>k</em>,
    very nice touch there.\r\n\r\nYou might want to eliminate the bottom-left serifs
    of <em>l</em> and <em>t</em> and replace it with right serifs. Right now they
    looks a little bit unbalanced, I think.\r\n\r\nThere's also a balance issue on
    <em>m</em>, where the second and third downward strokes appear too thin, when
    compared to the first stroke (that you purposely made thick as a tool to achieve
    consistency). You might want to thicken the second downward stroke, so that the
    alphabet's progression goes more smoothly from thick (left) to thin (right).\r\n\r\n<em>w</em>
    looks unbalanced, not only angle-wise but also visually. For instance, the second
    'v' appeared to be on a slightly different angle when compared to the first 'v'
    shape, the crotch that's inbetween the two v's should be wider, and the two counterspace
    should be more optically equal.\r\n\r\nDesigning <em>x</em>, like designing <em>s</em>,
    takes a lot of practice and patience to get them to appear 'right'. Is there any
    explanation behind the uneven angles on the <em>x</em>? If you want to make them
    uneven (which could be to a good or bad effect), you better connect them optically
    (ie. the strokes should look like they're connected, although, in vector, they
    really are a little bit off from each other).\r\n\r\nThe <em>y</em>'s crotch seem
    too small. I understand that you want to keep all the left stroke thick, but maybe
    you can make <em>y</em>'s second stroke a little bit thinner to open up the counterspace.\r\n\r\nLove
    the <em>fi</em>, but I'm wondering if you could even take the ligature concept
    further (since this is meant to be a display face) and design it slightly differently,
    rather than jst connecting the letter <em>f</em> and <em>i</em> together.\r\n</ol>\r\nI'm
    really sorry if my critique is harsh. I hope it can help your typeface for the
    better. I also hope that you got a buddy that can help you understand all the
    English. At times like these I wish I knew the French language more :)\r\n\r\nThanks
    much, Marc!"

    create) to evaluate the typeface in a line ?\r\n\r\nThanks very much Bram !!!!"

  body: "Marc,\r\n\r\nAbout the F, I meant the capsline\u2014specifically its stiff
    left edge\u2014not the arm (sorry about that).\r\n\r\nTrue, the dots on i and
    j are usually set at caps height; but on a display face, it is common to move
    them down to achieve balance (especially since you're going to print them large)\r\n\r\nI
    think you can have W wider as well; right now, it does appear slightly thinner
    than M anyway.\r\n\r\nAs for the sampling text, I use the one that everyone commonly
    use, 'Hamburgefonstiv'.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Thanks a lot!"

  body: "Hey Marc,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I haven't been able to comment on Azoumbie.
    Actually, the reason I'm posting here right now is to excuse myself for a hiatus
    for several months. Lately, the agency has been getting a lot of projects (and
    meetings have also gone crazier, from several times a week to every day), so I
    feel that I have to focus on that for the time being.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry
    that I wouldn't be able to leave a comment for Azoumbie in the next few months,
    but I do know that this typeface is looking better by the day, so please keep
    on working on it!\r\n\r\nComments for now:\r\nThe g looks good, but it's lacking
    an angle on its bottom bowl (right now it's just plain square)\r\nv and w looked
    excellent and more balanced. Love it. You need to do the same thing with y, but
    that shouldn't be too much of a problem.\r\nHave you tried making the upper serif
    on l, t and i to face left (like what you did on h)? It would provide more balance
    to the letter, I think.\r\nAlso, the bottom-right serif on n will need to face
    right, so that the alphabet won't look like it's falling over :)\r\n\r\nThis typeface
    is shaping up very nicely, and I'm looking forward to finally be able to see it
    to completion. Thanks a lot for your patience so far, Marc, and I'll be sure to
    see you soon!"

    or suspention, do you mean  you really do a good improvement but the typeface
    is bad or you never been a good typographe ?\r\n\r\nDont be shy to tell, I prefer
    the thruth even if its thaught.\r\n\r\nHave a good day to both or you !!!"

  body: "Well, to be honoust, I'm not really a typographer (everything I \"know\"
    about it is what I read in books -and mind you, I'm not much of a reader, I basically
    just look at the nice pictures ;-) ) & on these threads, but I've developed a
    great interest in it a few years back & even made a few attempts of making my
    own typefaces posted here as well.\r\nWhat I meant by the 3 dots is that you should
    definitely keep working on typography! Seeing as this is only your first typeface,
    you're already way ahead of me. So when you're done with Azoumbie, please show
    us everything else you start with. I can't wait to see more of your work!"
