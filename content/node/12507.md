  \r\n\r\nI'm sure the bloggers will soon notice that the new logo and the Spider-Man
  movie font are based on T26 Mata, the same font apparently used as the basis of
  the original Xbox logo. \r\n\r\nSi "

    is that the market's attention span is counted in seconds, and that many will
    be too glazed over to see the connection. But nice catch, sii.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i saw the connection to the spiderman font, but i dont know much about identifying
    typefaces so i couldn't relate it to T26 mata.  Although it is a new, as such
    'futuristic' font, i do not think that it relates with the console that well.

  body: "I cringed at the first sight of this.  Not fitting whatsoever, especially
    in light of the Spiderman AND XBOX relations.\r\n\r\nDuring my stint at T26, we
    \"retired\" roughly half of the library from active promotion due to low sales
    and poor quality.  Mata nearly got the ax, but the Spiderman phenomenon kept it
    selling.  Microsoft was considering OEM licensing Mata for Windows... not sure
    what happened with that.\r\n\r\nMata was one of the first T26 fonts.  It's amusing
    to see such a dated design make such a (IMO) premature comeback on so many high
    profile fronts.  A true life testament to publishing your designs... setting them
    loose upon the world for reckless and uninspired art directors to pitch for huge
    accounts.  Too bad Greg Samata is only seeing chump change for the usage."
