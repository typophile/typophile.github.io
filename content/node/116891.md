    would be helpful if you could cut your image into parts and post them separately.

  body: "Dick, the problem I see with identifying a Victorian sans is that they got
    little publicity and were not featured by the foundries. They were used relatively
    rarely.  I think the sample is more likely to have been called a Gothic than a
    Grotesque, if only because of the leg on the R.  Many foundries sold these by
    number and not by a specific name. If I had to guess a name for it, I would call
    it simply a Gothic Extended.\r\nDon"
