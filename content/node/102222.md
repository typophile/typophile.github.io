  out my problem is centered on unicode 2665.\r\n\r\nIf I include unicode 2665 (heart)
  in my font, MS Word (or PowerPoint) will not render the font and insteads renders
  every glyph in Times New Roman.  However, if I simply remove 2665 from the font
  MS Word renders my font perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe same font renders perfectly in MS
  Publisher, InkScape, and Gimp.\r\n\r\nI have tried searching but can't find anyone
  who has had my particular issue with an unicode character.\r\n\r\nI'm running Windows
  7 64bit, Office 2010, FontForge 13:48 GMT 22-Feb-2011.  Which is the latest stable
  FontForge version for 64-bit windows.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what information from
  the font is needed to figure this out, so I'm just including the font sfd and ttf.
  \ (had to rename them to txt to upload)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help, I'd be very
  greatful.\r\n\r\n"

    u+2665 glyph, aside from it's unicode value? As in, is it the tallest or widest
    glyph? \r\n\r\nJust fishing, but it's worth a thought.\r\n\r\nJason C"

    body: "No, I have tried it with different glyph including a blank glyph.\r\n\r\nIt
      seems to have nothing to do with the glyph itself only the unicode value 2665.
      \ It also doesn't matter what the name of the glyph is.  I can have it named
      \"heart\" and it works fine if it's another unicode number.  But of course,
      I'd like the unicode map to be correct."
