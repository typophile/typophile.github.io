  that's being used in many London Underground stations is - it's bugging me. \r\n\r\nI
  know Johnston is used for the signage, but this is clearly not that.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: I think these modern tiles are based on the original 1900's ones from when
    this early stretch of the Northern Line was the Hampstead Tube, and they were
    put up in a mid-'90s refurbishment. Right now I'm looking at a photo of Euston
    in 1907, which I'll try & scan later, and it looks the same. I don't think they
    have them anywhere at Euston now, but have you seen them on any other line apart
    from the stretch of the Northern between Hampstead & Mornington Crescent.

    thinking I've seen it on some of the more central stations, but can't recall any
    right now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    my photos of the new tiles which were at the earliest mid-'90s.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MyShots2009_4901.png]\r\n\r\nLondon
    Transport seem to be very good at archiving all their material, and as the original
    plans for the 1900s Hampstead Tube stations still exist I expect they had the
    drawings of the original lettering to work from."
