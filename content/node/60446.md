  of creating the ideal typeface for use on spaceship exteriors in sci-fi movies (kind
  of a joke idea but I ended up really making it). You can download 3 weights for
  uppercase, numbers, and some alternate characters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/orbtiron_test_6164.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  created a [[http://pixelspread.com/orbitron|minisite]] for the font and posted the
  [[http://pixelspread.com/file_download/9|three weights for download]]. I thought
  I'd post the font files so I could get some feedback."

    the next X-men movie. :D\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I always wonder, why any typeface
    that has square-ish, bevel corners letter would be considered as sci-fi, futuristic
    typeface?"

  body: "I'm happy with it. I started out with the intention to create a very specific
    kind of typeface and I think I've succeeded in doing so. I'm really interested
    now in working out the kinks like keeping characteristics of the face from the
    medium to black weight and getting the font metrics right.\r\n\r\nAs for why square-ish
    bevel typefaces are considered futuristic, I think it has a lot to do with modern
    architects' use of similar geometry. When Mies and Corbusier started introducing
    entirely new 'futuristic' structures like glass and steel boxes and skyscrapers,
    I think it introduced the visual vocabulary of what the future will look like.
    Eurostile seems to have taken that idea and run with it, and we're kind of left
    this this vestigial idea of the future will be that remains in sci-fi movies.
    Whether the future will be square and beveled or not, who knows...\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

    do with that too. To draw the square shape, Computer sciencist can draw it with
    the pixel easily. "
