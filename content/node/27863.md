    \r\n\r\nHowever, you could always set it with normal bullets and do a find/replace
    when you are finished.\r\n\r\nI would suggest using an embedded character style
    for the first character so you can assign a baseline shift also. This assumes
    you are using InDesign CS2."

  body: 'wow thanks for the responses I didnt expect them to come so fast, unfortunately
    Miss Tiffany im using Indesign 2 and i dont see an option to do that, though im
    sure there is one im just too ignorant to the programme. Nick thanks for the suggestion
    to use a different font, right now im using 36pt size full stops from Helvetica
    rounded, i still have to place the circles on a horizontal axis because i dont
    know how to use negative tracking (putting the circles to the left of the text
    frame, so they appear to be out of fram) but the pre set leading helps a lot thanks. '

  body: "Not sure what you mean by \"on a horizontal axis\" but to 'outdent' anything
    simply indent everything <em>except your bulleted copy</em> and, shazam, your
    bullets are hanging outside the margin.\r\n\r\n(You may need to adjust the placement/width
    of your text frames to compensate for the global indent.)"

  body: "It's strange that neither Zapf Dingbats nor Webdings has a plain open bullet.\r\nHowever,
    you could perhaps use the Webdings bullet (Webdings is a Mac OS font), outlined.\r\nIt
    comes in two sizes."

  body: "If you simply want -- or can use -- and outlined bullet, this is a perfect
    opportunity for nested styles. You could create a \"character style\" of the black
    outline and \"nest\" it in your \"paragraph style\" which assigns proper indentations.\r\n\r\n<a

    feature would also do the trick.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither of these features exist
    way back in InDesign 2, which is what Pank is using. Sorry!\r\n\r\nT"
