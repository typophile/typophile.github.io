  body: "It looks like a number of film type slab serifs. One Egyptian called Karnak
    had many of the same structural features, but my book only shows a Black weight.
    McGrew's book on Metal Types shows another version called Karnak Obelisk, that
    is about the right weight, but I see the S has a different curve to it. In this
    time period you are probably looking at a film type or metal.\r\n\r\nAmong digital
    fonts, Jim Parkinson had an Antique Condensed Two that is similar, but narrower.
    Adrian Frutiger's Egyptienne Medium Condensed looks like a good match, and dates
    from 1956. (You can tell I worked in stream of consciousness style, as i looked
    things up, ending with what I think is the best answer.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
