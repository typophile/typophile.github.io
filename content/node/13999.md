  Either Constructa Extended, if it exists, or a very similar slab that would be more
  on the proportions of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rockwell-mt-2/\">Rockwell</a>.
  I plan to use Constructa as it is <b>together</b> with whatever you all recommend,
  so they do have to appear similar. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    has a wider range of weights/widths (4x4=16) rather than use <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Constructa\">Constructa</a>
    which only has 3 styles, I'd think of switching it all to dispatch."
