  body: "Can't find a match but really doubting there could be one. Feels \"customized\"
    to me. Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/isonorm|Isonorm]].\r\nMore
    clients for customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/millar|Millar]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/af+module|AF Module]], [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Greyscale-Basic|Greyscale
    Basic]] (possibly the closest, only needing /b to be reconstructed from /o + ascender
    and tweaking /a), [[http://www.shiftype.com/fontdetail.php?m=1&p=3|BetaSans]],

  body: I agree with Ryuk that this is custom. The C appears to not be a useful cap
    in a whole font - scale is wrong as is placement - this is a logo, not a font.
