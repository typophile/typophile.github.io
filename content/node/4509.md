body: Just wondering what your collective philosophy is concerning where you normally
  put logos when designing business cards.   <BR> <BR>The last two that i have done
  had had a great deal of contact info, thus compelling me to put the logo on the
  back solo, and the info on the front, sans logo. <BR> <BR>I know this isn&#39;t
  the way they teach you to do it in school.  But do you folks think?

    the back&#41; is that a lot of the folks in business still use B-card binders
    or rolodexes, so you want to try and keep it all on one side. '
