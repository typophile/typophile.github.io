body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI have recently noticed the lack of professional quality
  fonts available under open licenses here that are of any professional value.\r\n\r\nApple
  and Microsoft may have the money to license typefaces from other groups, or pay
  to have typefaces developed for them, but a community-built operating system depends
  on the community to contribute each in their own little way.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for any open fonts on a professional level, there are a couple already like Gentium,
  Bitstream Vera out there, which is a great start.\r\n\r\nAre there any more freely
  available and freely redistributable fonts you're already aware of?\r\n\r\nI urge
  all of you who benefit daily from open-source technology (Firefox, Openoffice, even
  Typophile is hosted on a linux server) to consider contributing some of your work
  towards the community that has provided you with so much software.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  to build a package of only the highest quality typefaces under a free licenses and
  make that available for download on my site related to Linux and Design, but they
  would be valuable to people on all operating systems.\r\n\r\nAlso, the availability
  of professional alternatives might help even just a couple from pirating or stealing
  those fonts type designers sell to make a living.  hopefully together we can give
  the community something valuable, generate more interest in good typography and
  at the same time help support those commercial designers who rely on font sales.\r\n\r\nAnd
  lastly, by releasing one font for free with credit to a group of open-source users
  who desire fresh new fonts, you can direct traffic to your other reasonably priced
  fonts and this will more thank likely channel an entire new market of clients that
  are currently not buying your fonts."

    working in universities, corporate research labs, government research labs, etc.
    In most cases the work was funded by the US government (which taxes me) or various
    corporations. Even Firefox is programmed primarily by programmers paid by Google
    (and is built on the old Netscape code), which pays the Mozilla foundation millions
    of dollars for search results from the search tool. The notion that great open
    source code is being freely given away by a bunch of generous hackers is largely
    nonsense; without financial backing of entities who have financial or other interests
    the code would not exist. \r\n\r\nAnd like all those paid programmers I have plenty
    of bills to pay. Going through design school put me in debt up to my neck. I\u2019m
    not about to give my work away\u2014especially when a global recession is kicking

  body: "wow.  Based on the interaction I've seen on this site I never would have
    expected such an averse reaction to the idea.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is
    what people do for a living, but simply because something is released does not
    mean it is a free-for-all and subject to derivative works.  What if the fonts
    are released in a CC-BY-ND licence, your work would be free to use and distribute,
    and even use commercially, but they would still be required to give you credit
    at the author, and they would not be allowed to make derivative works based on
    your typeface.\r\n\r\nAs for the big question of what do I get out of it, I think
    it's pretty clear.  I personally have been using linux since 2001.  I've used
    Firefox since it was Mozilla Phoenix, then Mozilla Firebird.  All mac users use
    a proprietary desktop, built on an open-source kernel called Darwin.  Safari is
    based on the open-source webkit engine, which was based on the khtml engine from
    the open-source desktop KDE.\r\n\r\nIf you've visited 3 websites in your life,
    chances are 2 of those depended on open-source technologies to be served to you.
    \ If they use Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal or another popular CMS it would also be
    running open-source software.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever been to wikipedia you've benefitted
    from open content, run on open-source sofware, hosted on open-source servers.
    \ And some of you have personal entries on that site too.\r\n\r\nSo, what do <em>you</em>
    get out of it?  I'd say you've already benefited from open-source in so many ways
    they could never all be listed.  Although many other groups of people (programmers,
    artists, musicians, photographers, 3d modelers, etc) have seen the open-source
    movement and joined in, helping each other out, it has become very clear to me
    that type designers are a cold, ungrateful group of people.\r\n\r\nIt may take
    a company funding development to get a good typeface designed, but it's shame
    that it would require that before anybody would consider 'giving'.  Because if
    you're paid, you aren't giving at all.  Well, I hope you enjoy your fonts all
    by yourself then, and I expect none of you will use open-source software again
    (or visit the linux-hosted Typophile) because it's all just trash anyway.\r\n\r\nAre
    you guys serious with this response?  When a schoolboy comes to your door raising
    funds for a charity do you tell him to get himself a job and donate his own money?

    Usenet posting that basically <a href=\"http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/76536d1fb451ac60/b813d52cbc5a044b\">announces
    Linux:</a>\r\n\r\n<em>Hello everybody out there using minix -\r\n\r\nI'm doing
    a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)
    for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to
    get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my
    OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical
    reasons) among other things).\r\n\r\nI've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40),
    and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within
    a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)\r\n\r\nLinus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)\r\n\r\nPS.
    Yes \u2013 it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is
    NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support
    anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"And
    the Linux operating system as a whole is hardly the work of hobbyists. Much GNU
    software that makes the kernel useful was produced by computer scientists and
    academics who wanted code that they could edit and redistribute. They didn\u2019t
    give it away because they were great philanthropists, they did it because they
    were nerds who wanted to tinker with code unfettered.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAs I said
    earlier, I don't really think that the Open Source/free software paradigm can
    work with type design. I'm not saying that you should design a font-family for
    free. In fact, I only stepped in to clarify that many open source projects are
    started as hobbies that grow into something much more. Too, I never said that
    Linux was STILL a hobby. It's obviously much more than that now.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    what would it matter whether the programmers were doing it be philanthropists
    or merely \"nerds\" who wanted to mess around with code? They released it OS/Free
    all the same. And again, I AGREE that this sort of thing wouldn't really work
    with type design. However, if type design is something that you love to do, and
    you find yourself fiddling with a font in your down time, just \"tinkering\" around
    with it, why not release it for free if you're already not being paid for it?
    After all, OS/Free also doesn't mean that a team of people HAS to work on it.
    A lot of my favorite software comes from a single coder who is nice enough to
    share their personal projects with the net.\r\n"

    like iKern and the like. The only problem with truly open-source typefaces is
    that, to its designer, a typeface is more than a purely functional tool. Trying
    to move typefaces into the open-source spirit of collaboration is tricky, for
    the same reason that an artist doesn't expect people to add more brushstrokes
    to his painting after he finishes it. While there are certainly technical aspects
    to type design, it is ultimately much more subjective than coding is. Someone
    earlier raised the issue of how a type designer would feel if someone suddenly
    decides that shortening the serifs would look better.\r\n\r\nI dunno, maybe I'm
    expressing it too simply, but I think that that's the major roadblock preventing
    type designers from joining the open-source community."

    been surprised at the backlash against this request. After all, the motto of Typophile
    is \"Typographic Collaboration\". \r\n\r\nIn response to this bitterness, I would
    like to highlight how this forum has, indirectly, perhaps already contributed
    to the requested project. Typophile is a forum in which experienced type designers
    can share their knowledge both among themselves as well as among less experienced
    designers. Without the Typophile forum we likely would not be seeing, on the one
    hand, the quantity or quality of free fonts that are being released these days,
    nor, on the other hand, the number of people would be in a position to contribute
    to such a project. So while it might be imprudent to try to design a coherent
    type system using collaborative strategies similar to those used in the open source
    community, this forum likely has given knowledge to many people who could participate
    in a more organized, even modestly funded project. And many of these people would
    not have the knowledge they do without this forum.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, I do
    not believe that the massive [[http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index.html|M+]]

    portion reads thus:\r\n\r\n<cite>These fonts are free softwares.\r\nUnlimited
    permission is granted to use, copy, and distribute it, with or without modification,
    either commercially and noncommercially.\r\nTHESE FONTS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\"

    could be spent doing something of greater benefit. I will simply consider the
    source and allow disappointment.\r\n\r\nYou have collectively, and completely,
    shocked me.  It's not often you misjudge an entire collective of people, but it

    disagree with this statement. There were a few moments in this thread where, though
    not named personally, rather unflattering terms and generalizations were used
    about a community to which innovati clearly belongs (I too, count myself in that
    community). I understand completely why he would get defensive and take things
    like that personally. Any vitriol found here cannot be fully attributed to the
    him, though. But for the most part, I think everyone's been very respectful.\r\n\r\nJust
    some more food for thought: <a href=\"http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/\">Jason
    Rohrer</a>, an open source/free game designer based in up-state New York, makes
    his living (roughly $10k/year) almost entirely from web donations from fans, plus
    the occasional commissioned game/article from an online gaming publication (which
    can't amount to too much). Of course, Rohrer doesn't want bills to pay, etc.,
    so his meager income is by design. But you CAN make money from releasing your
    spare-time projects open source/free (or even just free) and ask for donations.
    Will everyone who downloads your font/project/whatever? Of course not, but you
    can make a decent amount of money all the same, even if you just do something
    in your spare time.\r\n\r\nThough a bit hesitant to do so, I would liken exljbris
    foundry's release method to this, at least for Museo. 3(?) fonts for free, and
    you can purchase the other 2(?) to make the family complete. You get a great quality
    product for absolutely nothing. If you like it (a sidenote: I do!), you \"make
    a donation\" to Jos and get the other two weights. It's a bit of a stretch, as
    you're not really making a donation, but I think the spirit is there.\r\n\r\nAll
    that said, I'll just reiterate that I think any open source font project would
    have to have either a sole author or a very small group of like-minded designers
    to be \"professionally\" successful. \r\n\r\nEdit: Rohrer's income is actually
    in the range of $14.5k, as he has a consulting job with Electronic Arts, as well
    as a patron. I was a little surprised that such people still existed (patrons,
    that is)."

    me from some of the direct ad hominem attacks thrown at me while I was attempting
    to raise support for the benefit of others, though I did try my best to remain
    diplomatic and not fall into the trap of replying or arguing against any comment
    that I may have taken offense to in the interest of trying to keep the thread
    itself on track, lest it decay into bickering and nothing get accomplished.\r\n\r\nI
    apologize if I have disappointed you through my failure to either engage the forum
    in a manner in which intelligent discussion could be carried out, or through my
    greatest efforts to remain impartial toward comments comparing me to throwing
    a tantrum and questioning my comprehension of the nature of open-source and commercial
    development models.\r\n\r\nThis whole thing has really been a learning experience
    for me, and I hope that long after I have been removed from this thread and forum
    that maybe some seed of charity will grow in the hearts of those who did read
    the ideas, and hopefully some will eventually consider releasing some work under
    a license that allows free redistribution.  If that happens because of what has
    become this ugly thread I will still count it as a win for the greater good although
    I likely won't be here to see it.\r\n\r\nI was no longer checking this thread,
    and if I hadn't been emailed by another forum member I wouldn't have been back
    here to post this apology.  I feel that there are others here who rightfully owe
    an apology, but based on how things have unfolded I have serious doubts that other
    apologies will be made.\r\n\r\nI can't quite understand though Zara, and maybe
    it's because you haven't got the time to go through all of the comments as much
    as I had, but when a direct ad hominem attack is made against you, how else can
    you take it <em>but</em> personally?  Isn't that inherent in the nature of such
    attacks?"

    inherent in the nature of such attacks? </cite>\r\n\r\nTom, I have two perplexities
    about your attitude:\r\n\r\n1) Charity: I have strong doubts about the possibilities
    of being charitable through the offering of open-source works. Firstly, because
    people tend to abuse what's gratuitious. I would like to see initiatives to be
    rewarded by donations, I would like to see more sharing of work, and not all backed
    up by sponsorization, but as long as we're on this earth, in this human condition,
    spiritual progress largely depends on everyone's commitment and availability.\r\nIf
    you are unable to sensibilize people about recognizing the gratuitious nature
    of things (and I have strong doubts you can do that by words, seen how everything
    is often taken for \"granted\" and not \"given\", but this opens up a whole reflection
    on \"creation\" and \"authority\" which people tend to dislike, as they seem to
    prefer to live in a sort of \"automated\" way.\r\nCharity comes out of Charity,
    no other way.\r\n\r\n2) Youngness: I think this is a point of strength on your
    part, not just a \"vulnerability\". Personally I have never had the chance to
    attend studies. We simply did not have them around 20 years ago in Italy, that's
    all. But I see I have \"learned\" nonetheless, and the first step is not to give
    so much importance to \"personal attacks\" or the short-sightedness of many so-called
    professionals.\r\nI feel I still have everything to learn, but I am no longer
    saddened or embittered by that, since I have realized you learn in an infinite
    number of ways, and it may prove a more enriching experience to learn from a small,
    single thing, than to try to tackle the biggest problems on a wide scale.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I quite agree about the fact that it would be good to have more open source
    faces, but I also agree with the idea that we should have more works of personal
    dedication priced accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo, if you really wish to understand better,
    try to explain more in detail what you would propose, and I'm sure you'll get
    a lot of constructive feedback."

    not confuse services and products. Dentist, airline, icon and font design are
    services, it makes sense to pay for that. Pizzas are physical products, it makes
    sense to pay at least as much as the flour/tomatoes/etc cost. Making and baking
    the pizza is a service that adds value to the raw flour and tomatoes.\r\n\r\nUsing
    a font on my website or in a PDF is not a product nor a service the font designer
    provides, thus I don't see why I should pay or have to read legalese and worry
    about abusive embedding/redistributing/per-cpu limits. Once the font is designed,
    distribution is basically free. But of course unless the designer has a patron
    (is that the correct word? \xABm\xE9c\xE8ne\xBB in french) there is nobody to
    pay.\r\n\r\nThis is the same problem as with the music industry \u2014except font
    designers cannot live from live performances :-) In the end I wish I could have

  body: "I\u2019ve been only now catching up on this thread and the open invitation
    to type designers on Typophile and was sad to see how poorly received it was.
    I believe most of the negative responses were due to misinterpretations of the
    invitation due to ignorance of FOSS, its community and development models. I have
    seen many similar responses to the concept of pro bono work from professionals
    who felt themselves and their business models threatened by the flag of FOSS.
    Ultimately I believe ignorance begets arrogance and fear and thus hold it vital
    to try to understand new (sometimes very radical) ideas for often they are the
    proponents that lead to (often positive) change.\r\n\r\nIt is equally regrettable
    to hear that Tom may take an absence from the typophile.com community. Although
    I am not much of an active member, I particularly value the contributions in a
    holistic sense of those who do in fact understand FOSS for their insight and willingness
    to look past immediate concerns of payment for their time and efforts.\r\n\r\nThis
    said I understand the situation of many professionals who may find they do not
    have the time or otherwise ability to participate in an open type project\u2014I
    find I often don\u2019t have the time to read and respond to many of the discussions
    that occur here, along with the thousands of other things I wish I had time for.
    I think Tom\u2019s invitation was worded persuasively yet it was an invitation
    that begged for consideration, and he felt was met with outright rejection.\r\n\r\nI
    believe the misconception that openly licensed fonts are prone to depreciation
    through inconsistent or \u2018amateurish\u2019 edits comes from being compared
    too directly with other code-based software projects. In my opinion no font is
    ever perfect, and yes while this will always be an entirely subjective opinion,
    even Robert Bringhurst states that adjustments of the kerning tables can, and
    even should be made. Furthermore with Unicode always expanding the task of adding
    new glyphs and ensuring widespread language support will keep any open font project
    alive for years to come\u2014see the commit change logs of the more successful
    open font projects. If the project lead feels a negative edit has been made this
    can be easily reverted; similarly if the community is not happy with the decisions
    of a project lead, the project can easily be forked.\r\n\r\nThe argument that
    projects with visual aesthetics at their heart are harder to collaborate on than
    software projects with code at their center I believe has some merit. I think
    of these potential issues more as a challenge to overcome rather than a reason
    not to get involved\u2014the possible benefits of collaboration in my opinion
    are worth the efforts of overcoming subjective opinions on aesthetics. Having
    participated in the GNOME and Tango Desktop Project and otherwise the FOSS community
    for over a three years now, I am personally convinced that we have overcome many
    subjective disagreements over aesthetics and as a result have produced work we
    are proud of and the community readily uses.\r\n\r\nAs a final thought, I think
    a good starting point for a new open font project would be to begin with a faithful
    historical revival, thus possibly sidestepping some of the issues of aesthetics.\r\n\r\nKind
    regards.\r\n\r\n\u2014Simon Pascal Klein"

    (in a holistic sense) nor any specific project (that I aware of). There is no
    general guideline on starting a new project, though it generally just begins with
    invitation through dialogue, much like Richard Stallman\u2019s GNU project or
    Linus\u2019 kernel project posting on mailing lists\u2014in fact that\u2019s how
    most FOSS projects that I can think of came into being. Many developers perused
    mailing lists or newsnets, whereas many type designers are found at home here
    on typophile, hence Tom\u2019s decision to post his idea and invitation here.\r\n\r\nWe
    are not going to get a formal proposal from someone because the FOSS community
    does not operate like a traditional business; there is no brief, quote to write
    or contract to sign. FOSS projects commonly begin with a general invitation to
    join a cause to scratch an itch.\r\n\r\nSo, in an effort to get a ball rolling,
    here\u2019s what I think a Tom and we could consider aiming for:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a
    high-quality font family, whereby the quality is measured in hinting, kerning,
    character support/language support, number of weights and styles available, etc.;</li>\r\n<li>stylistically
    a good place to start as I noted above might be a digital revival, perhaps from
    the humanist period (it\u2019s one gap that is not yet covered by open fonts and
    humanist typefaces are reasonably popular);</li>\r\n<li>to publish the work under
    an open license, anything from public domain to an open font license (I haven\u2019t
    looked into this), a Creative Commons license, one of the open artistic licenses
    (their proper names currently escape me) or even the traditional GPL, or variant
    thereof (or anything else if none of these are applicable?).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSupportive
    technologies could include a mailing list, which would probably be a good place
    to start from if this project attracts a couple of people. Once anything gets
    going a distributed version control system (e.g. git or bazaar) could be set up
    to manage contributions and edits and to manage new interest and show off the
    work, a small site/wiki\u2014as an example, have a look at http://tango.freedesktop.org/.\r\n\r\nJust
    some thoughts?"

    you start a new thread and invite the interested parties to join in a directed
    effort that has a clear charter? Or will you let the negative initial reaction
    kill the whole idea? If it's worthwhile and you're committed to it there's no
    reason to waste energy by getting offended.\r\n\r\nIf it's worthwhile the people
    with passion for the idea will help make it happen. Wikipedia started as one guy
    who invited a small group of people to help him out with a social experiment.
    He didn't start with a grand vision of replacing printed encyclopedias. Say what
    you will about Wikipedia's quality, it has changed the landscape.\r\n\r\nTypophile
    will gladly host a project of this nature. There's no compelling reason not to.
    What Typophile can't do is convince people to join in or donate their energy,

    valid points, but the thread lost track do to missing the main idea and the \"two
    sides\" speaking not with each other, but against each other.\r\n\r\nIt probably
    was not diplomatic (and actually also *unreasonalbe* to suggest releasing fonts
    for free. Who would want to give away months of work?\r\n\r\nAlso, the arguments
    saying that fonts don't work like code is true (or not so... see details below),
    as it's evident that too many cooks will spoil the broth.\r\n\r\nI will, how ever
    feeble it might be, try to play the interpreter (and why I'll won't take this
    position permanently, I hope to give this thread a new track. (Yeah, tracking).\r\n\r\nNow,
    open code actually does not work like anyone changing anything at will. Or open
    code would not work either. Also, if you do study the OFL (it's not as long and
    NOT legalese. Go read it: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=OFL_web)
    carefully, you will find that it caters for overseen developement.\r\n\r\n(a)
    Open does not mean void of copyright! (b) there is the concept of \"Reserved Font
    Name\"\r\n\r\nBasically it thus also enables a cooperation style which would not
    ask for as much as innovati initially did and which also allows for a consistent
    font style and quality.\r\n\r\nThe licence allows users to modify the font, however
    if they redistribute the modified font they must use a different name. Of course
    they can resubmit their additional or updated glyphs to the original copyright
    holder, who then can decide to incorporate them right into the font with the reserved
    name, or can touch them up and include them then, or not to include.\r\n\r\nThis
    enables a workflow process that will benefit from micro-contributions and maintaining
    quality.\r\n\r\nA potential use case would be a designer releasing a basic set
    of ASCII-only character set, e.g. Designers are using them in their work. One
    needs a non-ASCII character (say, \"\xE9\"), so creates an \xE9-character for
    his local copy. Cause he cannot monetize on that single character he has created
    anyway, he resubmits it to the original author, who might include it in the next
    official release with little effort.\r\nIf our user created a whole big set (e.g.
    Cyrillic), 'cause he needed it, he can either decide to resubmitt (and he would
    be attributed), or he can start a \"new\" font (i.e. distributing it under a new
    \"reserved name\" including the latin and cyrillic, attributing the original author.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the more interesting scenario is the former one, as it operates with micro-contributions,
    which consume (relatively) little time each, and effort which comes collaterally:
    which you (potentially) need to do, but cannot monetize on anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    could be a potential model for Open Fonts. Well, it's exactly how it's supposed
    to work already, however the movement needs some pro's taking care of the key
    part assuring quality as the holders of the rights to the \"reserved names\".\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,
    it probably won't work out, 'cause once any one of us is at that level, he has
    also a couple of years behind him. Which necessarily reaps a man from idealism
    and which necessarily makes every man into an egoist (\"it does need to hurt me,
    but by not helping them out, I'll be in a 'better' position by not improving theirs\"~~~
    whatever-like thinking).\r\n\r\nNo, it's just natural. We're all like thet (no
    exception here). We all become like that with time, and we have to feed our families
    after all, don't we?\r\n\r\n\r\nGo, micro-contributions! [That's how Wikipedia
    works. Wikipedia sysdevelopers might, but editors are not paid by large corporations
    [except for those touching up information on world powers' politics and big pages
    about big companies' products...]].\r\n\r\n\r\n/Szabolcs\r\n\r\n"

    I did not give you permission to make your application public. The whole point
    of the application process is that it is meant to be a private conversation between

    You offered your Fell fonts to Alt Indie Typo, and accordingly I have given reasons
    why they don't meet Alt Indie Typo's technical standards. So this part is an issue.\r\n\r\n<em>In
    any case many actually use them without the problems you think will arise and
    every browser I have display them perfectly.</em>\r\n\r\nI tested them in Internet
    Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome, and those fonts render slowly. Speed
    of rendering is a critical factor for embeddable web fonts. Every font vendor
    I've had contact with will not accept fonts with stacked points in the outlines,
    and I conceive of Alt Indie Typo by the same technical standards.\r\n\r\n<em>Anyway
    I didn\u2019t offered my design services at all. Just spacing and kerning.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    thought you were offering your Fell type fonts. I appreciated what you were offering
    at the time, and as I told you in my reply email, if Alt Indie Typo needs manual
    hinting services I may contact you if and when the time comes. So it's hard to
    see the point of what you're saying above.\r\n\r\nI can't put any more time into
    this discussion thread, so I thank you Igino for acting in good faith and for
    offering the Fell Types and your hinting services. The best thing you can do with
    the Fell type fonts is clean up the outlines, reduce the number of nodes and eliminate
    all the stacked points.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    strong agreement: a high quality open source font project involving multiple contributors
    would need strong leadership and vision to stay on track and maintain that quality.
    But I suppose that even if the goal is to release something open source, there\u2019s
    nothing to say that one can\u2019t run the main development line in a less \u201Copen\u201D
    (in the sense of accepting all contributions) fashion.</em>\r\n\r\nThank you Tom
    for articulating that point so clearly. This is the approach I have taken with
    Alt Indie Typo. Totally open projects like Wikipedia have massive problems with
    their user communities. Complete freedom of everyone involved to edit everyone's
    contributions works for Wikipedia because it's a vast text writing project, but
    such openness comes with a price attached to it---lots of very stressed-out, frustrated
    contributors and a massive pseudo-legal arbitration system backed up for six months.\r\n\r\nType
    design and font production are much more specialized tasks requiring expert contributors.
    One applicant I had to knock back told me, in his own words, he only wanted to
    be \"a lurker\" in Alt Indie Typo. That could only slow us down. It isn't practical
    to have hangers-on lurking in the group solely to satiate their own curiosity.
    His use of that word \"lurker\" made me wonder what his true motive for wanting
    to be involved was. It's hard not to be circumspect of that word. At any rate,
    that kind of member would be too distracting.\r\n\r\nAlt Indie Typo progress report

  body: "There is a whole heck of a lot more wrong with Lavoisier than the oblique
    italics. Just in a couple of minutes I noted:\r\n\r\n- no optical adjustment where
    curves meet straights. hmnru are horrible\r\n- inconsistent sidebearings (left
    straight cap: 56 or 60? left round cap 41 or 44?)\r\n- just bad sidebearings (Z
    and N have the same left sidebearing, while s is 60% of Z)\r\n- slightly inconsistent
    stem weights for no obvious reason\r\n- horizontals are not enough thinner than
    the verticals to be optically the same. They look too thick or the verticals too
    thin.\r\n\r\nAlso, where curves turn into straights is very clunky to my eyes.
    Either give it an angled join or make it smooth, but the status quo looks bad.
    I suppose this could be argued to be a design feature (unlike the errors above),
    but I'm skeptical at best.\r\n\r\nThis is real amateur stuff. In a one-day seminar
    on type design, I'd cover all these points. Heck, I think I covered all these
    points in my 45-minute talk on font quality for \"TypoBerlin\" last year. They
    are just fundamentals.\r\n\r\n(No wonder type professionals and serious aficionados
    are skeptical about quality for open source fonts.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    open-source issue\u2014there\u2019s plenty of commercial fonts with the same problems
    on MyFonts. If an open-source type design project were to be managed by experienced
    designers this sort of stuff wouldn\u2019t make it into to project files. \r\n\r\nBut
    that does bring us back to the earlier problem\u2014how does the experienced designer
    pay his mortgage when he\u2019s taking time from work to oversee a free font project?"

    the experienced designer pay his mortgage when he\u2019s taking time from work

    a reasonable likelihood of income is usually enough to get a type designer moving.
    I'm working on a project now that took two years of planning before the contract
    was signed, including a lot of work on glyph set definition, making spreadsheets,
    costing the development, etc. all of which was done before I was assured of any
    payment. But I was willing because I knew that the client had the money and serious
    intent, so it was a reasonable investment of my time. So far, every open source
    font sounding has been incredibly nebulous. I'm waiting for someone to come along
    and say 'We have a grant/investment of X number of dollars/euros and want to commission
    some fonts that will be released under an open source license'.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    to me that one of the problems of open source advocates is that they are coming
    to type designers presuming that we are going to be enthusiastic about treating
    type design as open source software development. It isn't, and I'm not enthusiastic.
    As far as I'm concerned, open source or proprietary is a licensing choice that
    has absolutely nothing to do with design. So rather than looking for type designers
    to play at being open source software developers, I think interested parties should
    get their hands on some cash and then commission some fonts the same way our commercial
    and institutional clients commission fonts."

    did the same in Poland about NotCourier typeface...

    \r\nHow many of you for example rely entirely on type design for your living or
    are totally self employed? How many of you are financially secure? etc . I don't
    really want to know the answers but from my experience of over 40 years I find
    that self employed designers/craftsmen etc without financial security, can normally
    understand the attitudes of those with financial security better than the other
    way round.\r\nAs one who is totally self employed there is nothing I would like
    to do more than give of my talents freely for the benefit of others, and indeed
    I have done so on so many occasions. My family suffered as a result but my Bank
    manager was delighted as he could enjoy the interest on my overdraft. \r\n\r\nMany
    years ago I was a Chairman of a prestigious  society and I willingly gave my services
    and help for free and hopefully helped many people. But after 2 years I had to
    give it up as my freelance work and family suffered badly.\r\nThere is nothing
    I would like more now than to put my 40 years experience with lettering into font
    design as I feel I have learnt so much. But can I afford to do so - NO.\r\nI have
    no financial security so I have to keep on working to make ends meet.\r\nThis
    is not meant to be a sob story or an excuse to get the violin out but to ask some
    of you to grow up and face reality. Not all of us can give our time for free even
    if our hearts want to.\r\n\r\nIf you want the best-pay for it. \r\n\r\nFrom my
    long experience  I have come to realize that many of those who expect things for
    free normally have low standards and lack professionalism and don't really appreciate
    what is really involved in good design.\r\n\r\nIeuan Rees\r\n"
