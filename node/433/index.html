		<div class="commentbody">Despite the high prices on the ones already mentioned, all of these are so much cheaper (and especially the cost of an average font being now $25 or so for an individual license!) than what it used to cost back in the day. I can remember ordering a whole slew of types for a Monotype LaserComp in the 1980s and it was mucho thousands of dollars. Jackie, do you remember how much it was to buy fonts for an even earlier Alphatype or VIP system? And for that matter, I wonder how much one paid for a nice full magazine of Linotype mats when those were being sold new, retail, and made in the U.S.? Adjusted for 2007 dollars probably not cheap, either. (Forgive me if this is considered to be a highjack.)</div>

Back to the subject, what purpose does it serve to charge that amount of money for a typeface. I mean, if you can get away with it by all means, but damn! It's a volume thing I suppose? Why sell 1000 licenses when you can sell 2 or 3?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can think of a few reasons to charge gazillions for a font:

1. If someone will pay for it, then why not?
2. If you only sell one or two licences, then you can easily spot unlicenced use.
3. If people are paying that much, they are less likely to copy the font for their friends, and might even be careful about embedding it and such.
4. Having the most expensive font might bring at least a little fame or notoriety within the font community.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the most expensive font you can own -- is asking a type designer to design an exclusive font for you -- and have fun negotiating a price.

Meanwhile, depending on what year you bought commercial fonts, I spent more than 900 US Dollars for the Gill Sans family from Monotype. I couldn't believe I was spending it. But considering I owned it all on typositor at $30 a weight, and on Alphatype $60 per weight -- spending the 900+ seemed like a bargain -- it included more weights than the typositor or typesetter did.

Most I was ever taken for at one time -- Adobe. They put me on an automatic font release program. One January I came in on a bill for over $1500 -- it was everything I didn't need, old style numbers, mathematical fonts...how do I say it nicely? I was pi**ed.</div>

For me, something that has a balance between character and utility, like the full Myriad family, or Futura or Univers I could get tons more use out of than any of these expensive typefaces.</div>

You are absolutely right about using what you have (Myriad family, or Futura or Univers ) there good fonts.  However sometimes one becomes attached too a font so much that their willing to fork over cash for  whatever the retailer is asking for them.  I have bought a couple fonts that I love and use exclusively.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">like someone mentioned earlier, if you hired a type designer to design you a font, then had a world-wide exclusive on it forever, that would cost a lot. 

i wonder how much companies like 3 paid for their world-wide exclusive fonts? i;m guessing it's not cheap, but totally worth it for their branding. (plus miles did a fantastic job! i love verona!)

		<div class="commentbody">@Simon - have you taken a look at this?

http://www.linotype.com/24-19724/corporatetypedownload.html

As far as I understand, these are just the companies who wish others (like design agencies) to be able to download their corporate fonts. I am quite sure companies like Linotype or Adobe have a huge "secret" list of companies they made fonts for. Guess we'll never know :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Werfer - i hadn't seen that, interesting...

i once contacted a foundry to see how much a world-wide exclusive license would cost for my work for a custom family of fonts (Roman, Italic, Bold & Bold Italic in sans and serif) and the rough estimate was around $60k if it was all original. For a world-wide exclusive, i think this is quite reasonable. 

in regard to 3, some info is here about it: http://www.newlyn.com/work/client/3

i find this kind of work really interesting, and i respect miles a lot.</div>
