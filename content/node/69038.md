  the title in the main menu of the first network enabled, multiplayer 3D cyber space
  video game entitled \u201CSPECTRE\u201D.  This game was developed by Peninsula Gameworks
  for the Macintosh in 1990 and published by Velocity in 1991.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SPECTRE
  logo (from original game main menu)_5104.png]\r\n\r\nWe are developing an updated
  version for the iPhone and cannot locate the original font resources in our archives.
  \ None of us remember the font name (it's been 20 years!).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is not
  necessary that we find a version with the chrome type of fill, as solid black would
  suffice.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and interest.\r\nBest regards,\r\nCraig
  Fryar, President\r\nPeninsula Gameworks\r\n\r\n"
