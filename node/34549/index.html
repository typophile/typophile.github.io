I've been here for a little over a year & I've had some great time reading both original posts as the replies to my own.
What started as a site to escape to whenever boredom struck me quickly became like a second home to me.
I've had my share of laughs here & also some minor disputes, but all in all, it's been a great experience sharing thoughts with all of you. Due to certain circumstances I won't be posting anything new here for x time, so to all of you who are awaiting an answer from me: my sincere apology. I'll be reading new posts still, but as off now I'm retiring myself from participating in any threads. I really appreciate all the constructive ideas & links I've gotten from each and everyone of you & I'll do my best to keep up with any new posts, albeit in a merely passive way (I'll keep my profile active). Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone in my interests ;-)
Keep up the good work & maybe we'll meet again some day!

Kind regards,

Tom Lukacs - ill sans</div>

I always get a kick out of your wickedly great <em>nom de screen</em> and avatar... and enjoy your contributions to many threads here... Thanks especially for your encouragement with <a href="http://typophile.com/node/30114">Barrio</a>, which I still have to finish.  ;-D Best wishes to you, and I sure hope we see you around here again!

All the best,

To Ricardo: everything I've said in your or any other thread has been sincere. I really think Barrio has a lot of potential!
It's nice to know some people -who you don't even know personally- will actuallly miss your comments & contributions.
I honoustly hope to be back soon, but I'm sure I'll check in every now and then (more often than I'd like to admit) on Typophile. I just have too much on my head right now to participate in any threads... Just don't consider that as a lack of interest. I enjoy reading almost everything here on Typophile & I've learned a lot in the year that I've been a member. I can't promise to be back someday, but for what it's worth, I'd like to thank all of you for your insights/inspiration/comments...
All my best wishes to all of you! And thanks again for the above!</div>
