  body: I think this could be Marker Felt Wide, slightly stretched (that's an Apple
    systemfont).

  body: "I'm with Bert. I think the original font this was based on is Marker Felt
    Wide, designed in 1992 by Pat Snyder (samples <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg24.html\"
    target=\"new\">here</a> in the Script Font ID Guide). Bert's sample has all the
    same earmarks, and it's a free font. Wichita was designed in 1994 according to
    <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?DJ0\" target=\"new\">Identifont's information</a>.\r\n\r\nSo
    if anything, there are two 'winners'. Take your pick.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    may do the job as well."
