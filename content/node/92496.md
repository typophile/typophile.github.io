  Polish newspapers, but since I don't speak Polish I don't want to take this as evidence

    by Adam Twardoch:\r\nAt the page 38 (37) you can find a good \u0142\u0142 ligature.
    \r\nOn the page 34 (33) you can see a difference between printed and handwritten
    letters. (Note, that the someone forgot to add the slash to the uppercase \u0141).\r\nPage
    35 (34): \u0142 can look like T, but let the bar fly over the stem a tad.\r\nLet's
    come back to the page 38 (37): if you want, you can lead the outgoing stroke of
    the second l through both letters, so you draw the whole ligature with one movement.
    Very romantic."

  body: "Thanks everyone for the feedback.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, the ligatures I'm
    dealing with are uppercase, not lowercase, and this is a sans display face rather
    than a script face. I'm basically nesting one L above the other in an attempt
    to reduce whitespace.\r\n\r\nAt least in English, the result isn't terribly satisfying
    when it occurs across morpheme breaks (e.g. in compounds). Do all of the Polish
    examples of \u0141L given above involve morpheme boundaries? The face I'm working
    on has *lots* of interacting glyph variants, so the addition of any ligature actually
    involves creating numerous new glyphs. If these examples are restricted to morpheme
    breaks, I might opt not to include it. If they occur within a single root, then
    I'd want to include them.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    of a few common compounds and could possibly be seen far more often than all the
    other words in question, so if you face the all-or-none dilemma, I would rather
    go for no ligature at all."

  body: "Definetly. If you plan nesting letters, there should be no ligature here.
    The double \u0142 appears in few foreign words like <em>mu\u0142\u0142a</em> (mullah)
    or the above mentioned Lithuanian names. The only exception are forms of the past
    tense and conditional mood of one verb, <em>mle\u0107</em> (to grind), which seem
    to be a linguistic ballast, and aren't practically used in daily language. There,
    in plural, the \u0142l appears. It appears to mark a difference between masculine
    and feminine forms: <em>-\u0142li</em> -> m., <em>-\u0142\u0142y</em> -> f. So
    nesting the second letter there, would be a bit misguiding. But in the case of
    the suffix <em>p\xF3\u0142</em> (half, <em>p\xF3\u0142legalny</em> = semi-legal)
    - where one probably can create much more compound words than those few \"\u0142l's\"
    we are familiar with - crossing the boundary would be purely distructive."

    a non-Polish speaker, the <em>\u0142\u0142</em> sequences I've run across have

  body: "Polish <em>\u0142</em> used to be pronounced [\u026B] or [l\u1DAD], i.e.
    a velarized or \u2018dark\u2019 [l]. This sound is found in North American English
    dialects in words like \u2018ball\u2019 [b\u0251\u026B] and \u2018built\u2019
    [b\u026A\u026Bt]. In Polish the lateral [l] part was gradually lost, leaving only
    the velarization as a voiced velar approximant [\u0270]. Labialization came along
    at some point, producing [w]. (The [w] sound is not produced with a single gesture,
    but is instead actually both a bilabial and a velar approximant, i.e. [\u0270\u02B7].)
    Apparently the letter <em>\u0142</em> developed back when it was still a lateral
    sound and hence was paired with the letter <em>l</em> representing the ordinary
    voiced lateral approximant [l].\r\n\r\nBecause some Native American languages
    distinguish a voiced and voiceless lateral sound, the Polish <em>\u0142</em> letter
    was borrowed to indicate the voiceless lateral. Thus Athabaskan languages like
    Navajo use <em>\u0142</em> to represent their voiceless lateral fricative sound
    [\u026C], <em>t\u0142</em> to represent the aspirated affricate [t\u026C\u02B0],
    and <em>t\u0142\u02BC</em> to represent the ejective affricate [t\u026C\u02BC].
    In handwriting the Native American <em>\u0142</em> is distinctly different from
    the Polish <em>\u0142</em>, even though both are similar in print. Handwritten
    <em>\u0142</em> in Native American orthographies usually appears as a looped <em>l</em>
    with a crossbar, similar to a cursive <em>t</em>. In such hands people tend to
    write cursive <em>t</em> without a loop. In non-cursive hands the <em>\u0142</em>
    is often still written with a loop, but unconnected to neighbouring letters. Some
    people write it more like the IPA \u2018belted l\u2019 symbol \u026C instead,
    with the crossbar connected by a loop to the upright; this style of handwritten
    <em>\u0142</em> is where the IPA symbol came from. Finally, it can also be written
    in unconnected hands with a simple vertical stroke like <em>l</em> but with a
    slanted crossbar, very similar to the usual sans-serif appearance of <em>\u0142</em>.
    I would attach some examples but I don\u2019t have a scanner handy. Maybe I\u2019ll
    post some tomorrow.\r\n\r\nIn Native American languages it\u2019s not impossible
    to encounter sequences of two <em>\u0142</em>s in a row, but it isn\u2019t exactly
    a common thing. Representing them as a ligature would be confusing to most people,
    however. The only thing that might be advisable to do would be to ensure that
    the two crossbars don\u2019t overlap."
