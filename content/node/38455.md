body: "i guys,\r\n\r\nI just joined this forum and I am very interested to learn more
  about typography and design composition.\r\nI tried to post it on the typography
  section but there was like almost no one at there :( so, I hope you guys don't mind
  that I post it here \r\n\r\nFYI, I was a student in graphic design program but I
  dropped out after my first year because I just don\u2019t have enough money to continue
  so, while I am trying to save the money, I was thinking to keep on practice because
  I am still not very clear when to stop or dram the line what is good enough.\r\n\r\nI
  have few books about typography from my class textbook\r\nThe Elements of Typographic
  Style by Robert Bringhurst\r\nThinking with Type by Ellen Lupton\r\nTypography Workbook:
  A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design by Timothy Samara\r\nThe Ten
  Commandments of Typography by Paul Felton and Jonathan Barnbrook\r\nLay Out Work
  Book \r\nDesigner and The Grid \r\n\r\nbut I need to say that I am not very book
  person :(\r\n\r\nI am just wondering what is the best practice for me to do it daily?\r\nI
  am more than willing to make a commitment to my self to sit for 2-3 hours every
  single day and only to play around with typography and design composition (I have
  two jobs). \r\nBtw, I tried to read a book about grid system but I think its a bit
  avanced for me because I don't really get it. \r\n\r\nFor my future goal, I just
  want to work around typography, publication,web/motion and branding. My current
  goal is want to have a better handle of kerning, spacing, and choosing the right
  combination of font type for poster design and understand better design composition
  in print media .\r\n\r\nPlus, I want to learn how I can create my own type face.
  I tried to sketched some font type then, I scanned it and trace few of them at illustrator
  but then, what's next for me. \r\nI am quite clueless \r\n\r\nI was thinking to
  took some words from magazine articles/lyrics, type it manually, and play around
  so, I can have better handle at spacing and kerning but I dunno.\r\n\r\nby the way,
  is they any some kind of online courses (small budget) for typography?\r\n\r\nthanks
  guys\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "wow! thanks guys for the comments! \r\nJames, I was working in the print

  body: "There must be some \"old paper\" stores in town.\r\nOften comic book stores
    have old magazines, and many second-hand and antique stores have a few old printed
    pieces.\r\nThe thing about the old printed pieces is that they're from the pre-digital
    era, so the technology and fonts don't match exactly, and trying to create a facsimile
    digitally will always require a lot of \"massaging\" -- you really have to look
    hard to see just what the spacing is like, and fiddle with things like tracking,
    justification settings, maybe even kerning and horizontal scaling, to get the
    text to break in the same places, and it is this difficulty which will sharpen
    your eye and typesetting skills. "

  body: "I came into being a graphic artist through the back door -- working in a
    print shop. I started out as a pressman, but that job doing paste-up and mechanicals
    looked a whole more interesting, not to mention cleaner.\r\n\r\nOnce I managed
    to finagle my way into that one-man department, I began to teach myself by reading
    whatever I could find on type and design. I then took the approach Nick speaks
    of: I would see old and new printed pieces that I liked, and then would go about
    duplicating them. I learned a lot about type that way. \r\n\r\nI was quite content
    doing that for a while, but fortunately, one of our more savvy press-ready clients
    came into the back of the shop one day and saw my stuff hanging on the wall, and
    said \"You don't belong here...you need to be in a graphics house.\" Thus my careeer
    was born.\r\n\r\nSo even if that print job pays less, it might be worth it to
    find a way to work there."
