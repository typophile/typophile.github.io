  helped a lot. This is my first post.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the font used in Dr.
  Brown's soft drinks logo, as in the attachment. I am pretty sure the smaller letters
  could be replicated by Cooper Black (or correct if me if I am wrong) but what font
  is used in the \"Dr. Brown's\"?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\nNik"
