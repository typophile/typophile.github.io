body: "So as a graphic artist, I know nothing about web design. I know A LITTLE (from
  what things like myspace teach you with adding templates, etc), but that's about
  it. I'm trying to use WHAT I KNOW artistically to create my ideal website in illustrator,
  then saving for web and then linking them all somehow. I'm still working on that.
  Once I've got it figured out, I'm going to buy a domain and booyah! I will finally
  have an online website. Go me. Any help or critique would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n"

    the worst place to learn good web design. ;o)\r\n\r\nThe best advice I can give
    you is to remember that web design is more about suggestion than dictating. The
    best you can do is suggest a design, and the end-user may decide to over-ride
    your preferences. As such, work with the medium...don't fight it. ;0)\r\n\r\nAs
    for your GIF...that is what they call a 'splash page' and what most folks would
    call pointless and annoying. There's no reason for it. Just take me directly to
    your home page."
