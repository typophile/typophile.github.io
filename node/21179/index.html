<p>Handgun worship is simply militarism writ small. This year alone, the nation-states of the world will spent almost <strong>one trillion dollars</strong> on various kinds of hardware and software intended to maim, mutilate and kill other human beings. The companies and individuals who manufacture this hardware and software will become rich(er); meanwhile, tens of thousands of children will starve to death, and millions will die of preventable diseases or avoidable mishaps. Destroying lives is easy: any fool can do it (hence, this foolish discussion); saving lives is far more difficult, yet it&rsquo;s entirely within our means as a species, if only we allocated these misplaced resources to saving lives, instead of destroying them. If that&rsquo;s liberal thinking, then call me a liberal all you want: I&rsquo;m not ashamed to wear the label&hellip;</p>

<p>Sure, we all wish we lived in an ideal world. Guess what. Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. Not in the way the idealists think anyway. In the meantime, as far as real people are concerned, the FBI also reports that firearms are used three to five times more often to stop crimes than to commit them.</p>

<p>OK, I sort of agree. I think a sub-conscious mischieviousness may have been the context, although I can&rsquo;t be sure. Reading Nick&rsquo;s post did give me my best laugh of the day. He sure makes nice fonts, so I am willing to cut him a bunch of slack.</p>
<p>This is just another of those issues that has a lot of emotion attached. And wildly diverging opinions. Long ago, I advised religion and politics (this is a political issue in my mind) be avoided, but was voted down. So I guess I should have known better.

<p>As I&rsquo;ve argued before, censoring views on politics and religion is not called for, but deleting personal attacks is. It will keep typophile a happier place, in my opinion, with no loss to vigorous argument about any subject.</p>

<p>I guess it comes down to being a case where statistics can prove any point, depending on what you want your outcome to be. Here&rsquo;s what the NRA says about one study refuting Kleck:</p>
<h2 id="to-produce-the-misleading-ratio-from-the-study-the-only-defensive-or-protective-uses-of-firearms-that-were-counted-were-those-in-which-criminals-were-killed-by-would-be-crime-victims-this-is-the-most-serious-of-the-studys-flaws-since-fatal-shootings-of-criminals-occur-in-only-a-fraction-of-1-of-protective-firearm-uses-nationwide">To produce the misleading ratio from the study, the only defensive or protective uses of firearms that were counted were those in which criminals were killed by would-be crime victims. This is the most serious of the study&rsquo;s flaws, since fatal shootings of criminals occur in only a fraction of 1% of protective firearm uses nationwide.</h2>
<p>But to go in another direction, this is from Wikipedia:</p>
<h2 id="in-florida-which-first-introduced-shall-issue-concealed-carry-laws-crimes-committed-against-residents-dropped-markedly-upon-the-general-issuance-of-concealed-carry-licenses-which-had-the-unintended-consequence-of-putting-tourists-in-florida-driving-marked-rental-cars-at-risk-from-criminals-since-tourists-may-be-readily-presumed-unarmed-florida-responded-by-enacting-laws-prohibiting-the-obvious-marking-of-rental-cars-with-this-change-crime-rates-continued-to-fall-alongside-the-issuance-of-concealed-weapons-licenses">In Florida, which first introduced &ldquo;shall-issue&rdquo; concealed carry laws, crimes committed against residents dropped markedly upon the general issuance of concealed-carry licenses, which had the unintended consequence of putting tourists in Florida driving marked rental cars at risk from criminals (since tourists may be readily presumed unarmed.) Florida responded by enacting laws prohibiting the obvious marking of rental cars. With this change, crime rates continued to fall alongside the issuance of concealed weapons licenses.</h2>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have been an avid reader of Typophile for about a year now. It has been a great source of humour and knowledge for me in my hectic life as a designer and student. I am always mesmorized by the wealth of information one can glean from exposure to other like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>I have up to this point been merely a reader not a participant; mainly I enjoy trolling the forums for new ideas for type-choices and the like. But this weekend with the appearance of this thread I feel it is time to contribute.
How or why this discussion started I am not really sure&hellip;but for those us us who are beginning our careers as designers and trying to fuel our typographic fires, it is stomach-turning. I live in Ottawa - I get enough polictical diatribes here.</p>
<p>And for your consideration&hellip;perhaps you&rsquo;d reserve your comments about gun control if for example, you had RCMP officers in your family and this weekend several mounties were shot while in pursuit of a suspect. Then you had to wait by the phone to hear if your sister was dead after being shot by an unregistered rifle.</p>
<p>I respect the rights of free speech and even the right to bear arms - however it doesn&rsquo;t help me sleep at night.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s talk about type and leave the soapbox at home please.</p>

It is you who were not factual when you stated that FBI statistics show that more guns were used in self-defense against crime than in commiting crime.</p>
<p>Also you do not acknowledge your error, which makes me think you are not interested in a rational dialogue about the issue.</p>
<p>Also the NRA is rather notoriously biassed on these issues, so quoting them alone is not very convincing.</p>
<p>Let us look at what Prof. Kleck actually did. He had phone surveyers ask gun owners whether they had ever used a gun in self-defense against crime. This would include waving a gun at an 8 year old child who is cutting across your lawn (trespassing). So a few cranks who are constantly waving their guns at those they imagine to be trespassers could create the large &lsquo;self defence&rsquo; numbers Kleck reports. And it might be that a polite request would have been just as effective&ndash;and a lot more civilized&ndash;than waving a gun at someone. So it seems to me that Kleck&rsquo;s numbers (from 1993!) don&rsquo;t prove much of anything.</p>
<p>The gun control issue is not a simple one. But just quoting the NRA and ignoring problems with their supposed &lsquo;facts&rsquo; is not going to shed any light on the issue, nor convince anybody of anything.</p>
<p>Also Dennis, if you act on your principle &ldquo;you will believe what you want to believe,&rdquo; then what is your point in posting your provocative graphics?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To me this is pretty simple.</p>
<p>This place is about typographic work. If it&rsquo;s good, but contains politics that I dissapprove of, I still try to appreciate the work, and discuss it as such.</p>
<p>No one here, you included, Mr. Type Play, seems to be interested at all in discussing this on a typographic or design basis.</p>
<p>So here it goes:</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much typography in the whole thing. The typeface is standard and unspectacular, the composition is pretty cheap, and you don&rsquo;t seem to have given the whole typography thing much thought.</p>
<p>It seems to be more about wordplay than typeplay. And the word joke is kind of cheap too, in the sense that the motif has been used millions of times before in this discussion.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be on the right-wing side of politics, I don&rsquo;t really have an opinion on Gun Control, allthough in my country we don&rsquo;t allow handguns at all, and hunting weapons are really just used for hunting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna change anyone&rsquo;s mind with the trite word game on your &ldquo;type play&rdquo;. And since you&rsquo;ve allready come here with the preconcieved notion that the users of this site are of a liberal bent, comeing in here and posting this and then focusing on creating a hostile discussion on gun politics doesn&rsquo;t paint a very pretty picture of the people and politics you&rsquo;re representing.</p>
<p>I for one am not fond of the idea that people who like to enter situations with the intent on starting up a fight should posess lethal weapons.</p>

<p>Heavens no. It was the latest FP I did, and I merely thought it was fun. It is more a comment on man&rsquo;s nature. And went back to my comment about the two things we should steer away from in discussions.</p>
<p><em>Also you do not acknowledge your error, which makes me think you are not interested in a rational dialogue about the issue.</em></p>
<p>When I started reading the page you cited it made my head swim. I did see that it was by a very liberal source, and I know how fluid they can be with the truth. But I may have made an error in citing Kleck. But even Diane Feinstein believes the same as me when it comes to her personal safety.</p>
<p><em>Also Dennis, if you act on your principle “you will believe what you want to believe,” then what is your point in posting your provocative graphics?</em></p>
<p>It was just something I made, and liked. As stated before, there may have been an undercurrent of mischief involved, or I may have been simply tired and didn&rsquo;t think. It is too long ago now to say for sure.</p>
<p><em>So, let’s talk about type and leave the soapbox at home please.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any more sensitive topics to wade through, except maybe global warming , so I&rsquo;m with you.

What Dennis mentions here is what this should be all about.  A place where people can post things, and through discussion, learn something about themselves.  The only way you might change a gun toting homophobe is to talk to the person about it, rather than censor him/her.</p>
<p>It might be hard for you, or others here, to realize, but some people at times don&rsquo;t know where the &ldquo;line&rdquo; is, there are a lot of different folk in this world.  I actually appreciate Dennis&rsquo;s random weird graphics.  At times, they are not the smoothest of things to swallow, politically, or visually, for some here.  But the guy is honest, has passion and is excited about type, photography, etc.  which is more than can be said for a lot of people.</p>

<p>In a history class they aren&rsquo;t going to teach formulas, are they. A general education about type is not a silly idea. Occasionally some subject may be tied into a type discussion in a relevant way, but just discussion for the sake of debate isn&rsquo;t necessarily productive on some levels, especially when they might deter some people vewing the fracas from getting involved at all.</p>
<p>And rather then <strong>the noble route of simply admitting I am right</strong>, some people get upset by discussing things that don&rsquo;t fit the world view they have embraced.

<p>Pointing out an egregious instance of ignorance is not name-calling; it is pointing out an egregious instance of ignorance. Ignorance is no crime: we are all born ignorant, and we overcome it to greater or lesser degrees as we grow older. The title of this particular forum is &ldquo;General Discussions,&rdquo; which would seem to imply that give-and-take are the order of the day here. Persons who believe themselves to be in possession of Absolute Truth (that is, the Ignorant Militant) do not, by definition, allow much latitude for discussion: they wish to state their &ldquo;considerable opinion&rdquo; (thank you, William Golding) and have it affirmed, praised, perhaps even worshipped. That is <strong>not</strong> a discussion: it&rsquo;s a sermon.</p>
<p>People who think they have all the answers aren&rsquo;t asking the right questions.</p>

<p>You are indeed correct: Ms T IM&rsquo;d me to point that out, and I apologized for the misunderstanding. Maintaining one&rsquo;s cool when confronted with self-righteous intransigence is difficult. When I am confronted with the situation, I try to remember two things: one, an old Italian proverb which proclaims &ldquo;the ignorant are never defeated in an argument&rdquo;; and the other, which I hear from a co-worker (although it&rsquo;s probably not original to him), which is &ldquo;the less I know, the smarter I feel.&rdquo; Or, to take the Bertrand Russell quote from another angle, the more you know, the more you know you don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I think Stephen answered your other question about guidelines, but I think I should elaborate&hellip;</p>
<p>In our 6 year history we have only banned 1 or 2 accounts for persistently making libelous statements that could have put is in the path of a law suit or for posts that level personal attacks (name calling). We&rsquo;ve removed probably a dozen posts or more for the same reasons, but they have all included a proper warning.</p>
<p>And finally, some thoughts about General Discussions as it relates to your images. If you are truly looking for a critique of your use of type, then please post it in the Critique section. If you are announcing something newsworthy you can post it in News and Events. But if you&rsquo;re just promoting your products, it just doesn&rsquo;t fly very well to treat the General Discussions like a promotional outlet or a pulpit ( you can use the blog feature for that).</p>

<p>I had a very nice note from Tiffany (what a sweetie!)</p>
<p>First, I guess: Please note when I said I was always right, I put a winking smiley face after it. In other words <strong>a joke!</strong>
Get it? I guess I learned if you push the right button, some people see so red they wouldn&rsquo;t know a joke if it ran over them.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not a genius designer, and never will be. I feel I usually post my images because they seem to me to relate to the topic, like the cartoon font thread. In all cases I am just having fun. But to save the pros from the pain of seeing them, I will post just a link from now on.</p>
<p>Please note: I don&rsquo;t sell anything. I may seem to endorse free fonts, but that is because I have a big never-ending supply of them. But if someone wants to give a no-talent hack some nice commercial fonts, I&rsquo;d be glad to promote them to the best of my limited ability.
; )</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll just say there are no hard feelings on my part and let it go at that.</p>

I have seen that if you say something wrong on certain topics, apparently you can only be sent to the far corner in the extreme right-wing bigot category. And I usually am just as comdemnatory of them as I am of liberals.</p>
<p>Even if I feel something isn&rsquo;t right, I am not one to say what someone else has in their heart is worse than what might be found in mine.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t get overly finger-pointy, unless I am joking or having fun. Mostly I am just trying to have fun. Life is tough enough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that since this is a site devoted to typography &ndash; and despite the general discussions category &ndash; that fontplayer&rsquo;s original post didn&rsquo;t belong here as did most of the &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; followed (everything after Tiffany&rsquo;s post). I do understand his thrill of achievement and the desire to tell everyone about it. His posting it here may have been mischevious, but not provocative.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we should be able to discuss personal beliefs without losing respect for the other person&rsquo;s beliefs whether we agree or not. Descending to personal attacks, snide retorts and the like doesn&rsquo;t constitute a discussion nor respect. You may not agree with someone else&rsquo;s views but you must respect their right to those views.</p>
<p>As for Kleck&rsquo;s study, most police departments don&rsquo;t breakdown shooting incidents in any meaningful way. Most don&rsquo;t even separate shooting deaths into categories (police vs. criminals, criminals vs. victims, victims vs. criminals) so there aren&rsquo;t really any good FBI statistics. Kleck&rsquo;s study, while flawed, is the most accurate one that addresses the issue until a better one comes along. Instead of criticizing the study, it would be useful to design a better study that would produce unbiased results.</p>
<p>No one mentioned fontlpayer&rsquo;s considering joining the police force &ndash; deciding not to become a cop and be a designer instead (do you really meet a better class of people?) &ndash; and I was surprised no one asked what &ldquo;acp&rdquo; meant. There was not one nice comment about his achievement &ndash; 21 in 2 in. is pretty good (standard load jacketed or target load wadcutters? Goldcup or ?).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here because we share a common passion for typography that almost no one else does. Our other individual interests shouldn&rsquo;t separate us from each other. Incidently, I&rsquo;m a fan of open wheel auto racing, French art deco furniture, and bagpipe music (tubas? are you kidding?).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, here&rsquo;s a liberal learning a few things about bullet jackets and so forth, it&rsquo;s what general discussion should be about.</p>
<p>Why would a liberal care for such things?  Well, liberals plant little organic gardens so his family can eat fresh wholesome food without all those nasty corporate pesticides and such.  Then one night along come a freakin' band of deer that lay waste to his succulent tomatoes and yummy lettuce.  You try the deer spray, and the flashing lights, and the sound machines, and nothing works.  So, the liberal starts thinking about the rifle, or how deer hunting may not be such a bad thing after all&hellip;.  Relax, I haven&rsquo;t done anything&hellip;yet!</p>
<p>But, things like deer population control may not be an issue in San Francisco or Gent.  And, I take it back, he&rsquo;s Flemish, they ARE the belligerent barbarian Belgians.  Oh, oh, that could really set him off.  I&rsquo;ve learned, don&rsquo;t mess with Belgian politics.   I kid, moderator, I kid :-))</p>
<p>Incidentally, I’m a fan of ballroom dance, knitting, extreme cagefighting, and I collect those bread package twist ties, I must have about 2,300 by now!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is a common sentiment that one ought to engage in discussions of principles and ideas rather than comment on the character of one&rsquo;s interlocutor. For the most part I tend to agree. But there is little point in engaging in such discussions when the character of the interlocutor leaves so little to be desired.</p>
<p>For a couple of years and up until a few months ago I looked forward to jumping to Typophile for a few minutes throughout the day to listen in and see what others were working on, to discover recent type and typographic news, and, from time to time, to venture off on tangents a little more personal, always grateful for the community here and the exchange taking place. Over the past few months, however, I find myself less and less willing to inflict on myself the distasteful experience of coming upon the contributions of a single voice.</p>
<p>This post, however, is not a request for censorship of any kind. It is simply a note of regret that what was, for me, an engaging and technically sophisticated forum on type and typography, a community which had and still has an amazing collection of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and with a wide variety of perspectives, a rare and much appreciated place I had grown fond of visiting – this is simply a note of regret that Typophile has become, for me, so often soured by a single voice that I rarely visit more than once or twice a week, only to quickly back away, again, and again, discouraged and, quite frankly, nauseated.</p>
<p>For any discussion to produce productive and engaging dialogue a certain level of tact seems necessary. All tact seems to have gone out the window these days at Typophile, including the hesitant yet overwhelming urge I felt to write this post. Would that I didn’t feel the need to. Would that I had the wherewithal to restrain the urge to do so out of tact. Would that others had enough of the same to shut the fuck up.</p>

You see, not everyone is blessed with your poetic writing ability.  Some people speak or write a certain way and you should be tolerant of their history, backgrounds, and viewpoints. After all, as far as I can tell, this is a public place.  Everyone has the right to speak their mind as well as the right to refrain from selecting certain threads.  There are a treasure trove of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this font&rdquo; and &ldquo;what do you think of my logo&rdquo; places here, where you can go and impress everyone with your acquired knowledge.</p>
<p>To me &ldquo;Liberal&rdquo; has always stood for tolerance.  I think Typophile needs a lot more tolerance, of everyone&rsquo;s point of view.  Liberalism without tolerance leads to authoritarianism and censorship. It has given us Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Che, Chavez, etc.  Many of these were educated elitists who all &ldquo;knew&rdquo; what was right for their people, if they just followed the rules and learned to &ldquo;shut the fuck up&rdquo;, as you so eloquently put it.</p>

<p>I think on the contrary that what Jason wrote was very thoughtfully phrased (apart from the last sentence, but we have Typophile&rsquo;s automated auto-censoring thingie to take care of that :-). All he did was describing his personal experience with Typophile and how it has been tainted by the postings of a specific member. He is entitled to voice his concern, just like any other member.</p>
<p>And frankly you&rsquo;ve got your &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo; argument back to front. A tolerant person can&rsquo;t be anything but intolerant for intolerance. That&rsquo;s a classic case of double negation. Accusing someone of being intolerant because he/she doesn&rsquo;t abide intolerance is pretty ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think Typophile as a community is being <em>very</em> tolerant. If that weren&rsquo;t the case, I don&rsquo;t see how this situation could&rsquo;ve come this far.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yves, 
I&rsquo;ve seen one too many long and thoughtful comments posted here end with a nice big &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; sentence, which negates all the thought put into the entire post in my view.</p>
<p>Rather than get censored, what some people get are personal attacks, one is told that their ideas are nauseating, that they make people feel like puking, or that they are untalented hacks (something which you have fortunately edited, but unfortunately stays singed in people&rsquo;s minds.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the whole intolerance thing is ridiculous.  One can disagree with intolerance and have a reasoned argument with the person, try to change their mind, educate, etc.  At some point, yes, you let go and have no tolerance for the person.  But, right off the bat this turned into a pile up, instead of a discussion.   I happen to be fairly liberal, but I have many conservative acquaintances.  Many are actually very well meaning. Their views don&rsquo;t come from hatred or bigotry at all, but from biography and personal beliefs.  I talk to them about these issues, I don&rsquo;t start calling them names.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy put up a target that he took some shots at and everyone gets wacky, they started talking about bombing abortion clinics, on and on.  I just ask for some patience from people and not assume because someone owns a gun, or likes to hunt, or is pro life, that they are subhuman or that they don&rsquo;t belong here.  Or, as you also edited, can&rsquo;t make beautiful art.  I could point out dozens of right leaning artists throughout history that have made great work.</p>
<p>And I was in Ghent four weeks ago, no Barbarians in sight, only the queue to see the Van Eyck altar piece.  Now, they were belligerent!  It&rsquo;s really a beautiful city, everyone should visit, but don&rsquo;t speak French when you&rsquo;re there :-)</p>

<p>Not subhuman (an irremedial condition): simply close-minded (an eminently remedial condition). And, please, spare us the &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; label: the proper term is &ldquo;anti-abortion.&rdquo; If so-called pro-lifers were <em>really</em> pro-life, they wouldn&rsquo;t support the death penalty (which far too many of them do). And if &ldquo;defenders of traditional marriage&rdquo; were <em>really</em> serious about defending traditional marriage, they&rsquo;d push for a constitutional amendment, not to prevent gays from entering into committed relationships with the legal benefits thereunto appertaining, but to outlaw divorce, which terminates fully half of all the marriages in the United States (see how far <em>that</em> gets).</p>
<p>The point, I believe, which many of us here are trying to make is that hatred and intolerance, dressed up in high-falutin' names, are still hatred and intolerance. Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tiff nails it on the head. This is not an isolated incident, but the culmination of several weeks and months of repeated incidents.</p>
<p>I believe what we have witnessed here is a perfect example of group dynamism at work. Like it or not, Typophile is first and foremost a community, made up of living and breathing individuals. One of the characteristics of such a community is that it is governed by certain unwritten rules. For example a community will always be in flux, but at the same time try to reach a state of equilibrum. Every individual joining that community will disrupt that balance, whereafter the community will attempt to regain a new state of equilibrum.</p>
<p>If the balance is too severely disrupted, the rest of the community will try to adapt. When it fails to achieve that in the usual manner, it is to be expected that other members will re-evaluate the community they belong to and their place in it. Some will leave, as we have unfortunately witnessed a little while ago when a most valued member decided to terminate his membership. Others will react and try to rectify the situation in more drastic ways by going head-to-head with the perceived disruptive element. As such, this thread is the result of something that has been building up for the last few weeks and months.</p>
<p>We have to be realistic and accept that not everybody fits in just any community. That is the nature of the beast. Again, nobody was censored nor forced out. Joining and leaving Typophile is a personal decision.</p>

The humour got lost in the translation; I guess I should&rsquo;ve linked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sometimes in a very dichotomous situation, being a moderator <em>and</em> a human being; it&rsquo;s not easy, especially since my personal situation makes me extremely sensitive to certain remarks (my sister is a lesbian and my sister-in-law half Italian, half Moroccan, which make them perfect targets for the growing extreme right wing movement in Flanders).</p>
<p>So, to put my quote into context &ndash; as a moderator I apologise, but as a human being I don&rsquo;t regret it because sooner or later it simply <em>had</em> to happen. As we&rsquo;re usually pussyfooting around all the time trying to not offend anyone ourselves, the offenders get away with it and the offended can eat it.</p>
<p>Whatever, I&rsquo;ll shut up and retreat into self-imposed exile to the Type Identification Board now. This section simply doesn&rsquo;t agree with me.</p>

I hear you&rsquo;re pretty good, but, really, you are no Zidane!</p>
<p>Oh, and you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m tired of the &ldquo;pussyfooting&rdquo; too.  If you&rsquo;re a hack, we&rsquo;re coming after you, you&rsquo;ve been warned.  Students included!  Toughen up kids.</p>
