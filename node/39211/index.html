<p>He listed Font Bureau, House Industries, H&amp;FJ, and Emigre, and implied that there weren&rsquo;t really any others that came close.</p>
<p>I mentioned a couple that I thought were contenders, but he contended that these four were THE rock stars, and that any other than them were more like &lsquo;indie rock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are obviously lots of talented individuals outside of these, but what about other companies?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">True enough. Though if the company is the record label, the rock stars are the designers who in turn own the record label (in most of these cases - Adobe notwithstanding).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Si is right. Also the Mono-Lino conglomerate has to be there, as well. They have a lot of both good and bad in their back list, and their new stuff is also uneven. But they have so many classics and enough good recent stuff that I would think you have to include them.</p>
<p>So from the point of view of &lsquo;labels&rsquo; the big 5 (in no particular order) are probably: FontBureau, H&amp;FJ, House Industries, Monotype Imaging, and Adobe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t include Microsoft, as its type is normally included with software, rather than sold separately.  Beyond those 5, you would probably get more arguments, including about Emigre.</p>
<p>edit: On second thought, if you are thinking &lsquo;quality&rsquo; any list of foundries is probably misconceived. The story of type in the past ten years is as much a story of <em>individuals</em> as foundries, though both are important. For example, Village, with its collection of outstanding designers, may be as much of a factor now as House or Emigre. And Christian Schwartz, who has published through a number of foundries and collaborations, is so productive and his quality so high that he on his own is a virtual foundry. Then you have one-man American shops like those of Typophilers Mark Simonson and Eric Olsen, who also have a large and high quality body of work.</p>
<p>And among distributors you have Veer and Bitstream (MyFonts), who also have high quality work that is exclusive.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think a picture of a big 5 is very representative of what is going on in the production of type in the US.</p>
