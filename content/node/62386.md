body: Hey, I've tried everywhere to find this script font. It may be customized, but
  I've seen it used a lot, so if it is customized, then a lot of people are doing
  it. Any help would be great! It doesn't have to be an exact match. Just something
  close. thanks

    Script</a>. But it doesn't have any of the "western" elements.

    \r\n\r\nIf this isn't based on Edwardian, then whoever made it was cosmically
    connected with Edward Benguiat, designer of Edwardian Script."

  body: "Thanks. Those are close. In the meantime, and murphey's law that I would
    find this after posting a request on a forum, I found something super close, just
    without the customization\r\n\r\nCheck out\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/jackie-o/"

  body: "Jackie O is also close. Good find!\r\n\r\nI am now 99% positive this is a
    custom job, based on Edwardian Script. The difference between the two \"r\"s seems
    to give it away."

    handlettering, although in all likelihood they at least reference a font for the
    basic forms. I suppose if I was more organized I might actually be able to find
    a link\u2026 ;-)"
