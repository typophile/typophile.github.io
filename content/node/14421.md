body: "The Tiger Widget, <a href=\"http://www.figlet.org\">Figlet</a>, generates ascii
  text in about 9 different styles. You type in the word and it generates the ascii.
  It's fantastic. It offers the convenience of adding the text to your clipboard so
  all you need to do is paste it into your app.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n ___         _           _

  Cast</a> is a Tiger widget from Code Line Communications that lets you preview fonts
  installed on your system. Good for its simplicity. One problem is it seems the kerning
  falls out, leaving some awkward spacing."
