  body: "Well, if you know this is from the 60's that should tell you why finding
    similar fonts could be hard. Many pre-digital fonts never made it into digital
    form. \r\n\r\nThe most similar font I could think of is called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/arbiter-bq/|Arbiter]],
    by Aldo Novarese.\r\n\r\nI have scoured the Solotype Catalog, Rookledge's Typefinder
    and some of my Photo-Lettering books. It has a familiar look, so it's driving
    me nuts. I think Mark Simonson has a pretty good collection of older type books,
    and might recognize this. \r\n\r\nI am still looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely right, this could be something that never
    made it into digital form, but, like you, it has a familiar look and I feel like
    I've seen something very close to it in digital form somewhere.  Thanks so much
    for looking....\r\n\r\n--Keith"

  body: It's an old film font from the Seventies by TypeSpectra (Phil Martin) called
    Sequel, and it's been stretched horizontally. I am not aware of a digital version.

    fact that a certain \u2018Mike Y\u2019 gets credited with a good deal of all IDs
    here."
