  a very impressive building.\r\nThey use a custom (?) typeface in their advertisement,

    and Christian Schwarz designed for Deutsche Bahn recently. It is still only sporadically
    seen in Germany, because implementation takes a long time over such a big network.
    Most of the printed stuff seems to have changed over in my neck of the woods,
    though.\r\n\r\nSince the Berlin train station just opened, I guess they would
    have done things in the new type, instead of redoing things. Looks good, though,
    right?"

  body: "Chris, I think that one of the problems is decentralization. In Germany,
    the train company (which is still state owned, or at least mostly state owned)
    is involved with every local city's transit networks as well. They run the commuter
    trains, while local organizations seem to handle subways, trams, and buses. Local
    transit system have their own signage identities (especially Berlin and Munich,
    whose most recent redesigns are all very good, in my opinion, even if the whole
    network wasn't really covered).\r\n\r\nIf Amtrak was a real, well, a real *anything*,
    maybe one could talk to them about a national Amtrak signage typeface and/or system.
    Local prop-us like the DC Metro might then be impressed by said results, and a
    \"me too\" effect could ensure. The closest thing one can show would be James
    Maltabano's new highway faces. Somehow, I don't think that showing European success
    stories, even great ones, would carry much water :(\r\n\r\nI worked in DC for
    a year, and I must say that I was thankful that Metro had any sort of coherent
    signage system at all. It wasn't good, but in the US, most transit authorities
    seem not to put anything together. "

    no I haven't, but then my collection is still in its infancy. If the 'STOP' on
    the road is super-condensed because it's on the ground, would you likewise paint
    super-extended letters on the platform to be read as you travel past? Be a great
    way to add a some texture to an otherwise dull surface, anyway. Like the opposite
    (in size) to the Concorde station in Paris. Few things better than letterforms
    to create texture. :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concorde1_4727.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concorde2_6019.jpg]"

  body: "I visited the Berlin Hauptbahnhof a few days after it opened. The information
    system in the new station does not utilize the new Spiekermann typeface. You see
    this new face, however, in the on-board printed timetables DB places in just about
    every seat in the EC and ICE trainsets. (although the graphic integration/modifications
    in the timetables are not yet complete)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the new typeface
    was viewed by billions during the world cup, as it was clearly present in close
    proximity to the goalposts on the DB billboard cards in virtually all twelve stadiums.\r\n\r\nSome
    of my Berliner friends criticize the new Hauptbahnhof because it flows the ICE
    trains away from the traditional Berlin Stadtbahn stations, but that is a very
    minor flaw. Others are upset because the original design was compromised by DB
    to reduce costs. I heard others call it a \"big shopping plaza.\"\r\n\r\nI say
    all of this is nonsense. This new station is so intriguing, so compelling, so
    well thought out, that it becomes clear immediately upon arriving that it is the
    most light-years advanced facility of its kind in the world. Its the first epic
    train station built from the ground up in Europe in 100 years. As a lifelong resident
    of highway cluttered California, its a joy experiencing public facilities like
    this one."

    if you live in Berlin, or are visiting Berlin for virtually any business or pleasure
    trip. The location of this new station is only good for traveling politicians,
    and a few people who travel to meet business or consoluting contacts in the government
    park.\r\n\r\nThe train station is a monolith that was intended to act as a service
    hub for a city of 6 million. However, since reunification, Berlin's population
    has not doubled, as was originally expected. And even if Germany had another economic
    miracle, I doubt that it would.\r\n\r\nBut, it is a pretty building."

    true. Thanks to Hauptbahnhof, the thin and very error-prune East-West connection
    can be relieved a bit. This should result in less delays and better scheduling.
    One of the major flaws of the Berlin train transit so far was that if one train
    was late, the entire system was shuffled around because practically all trains
    had to be rescheduled. \r\n\r\nGetting to Hauptbahnhof from any of the other stations
    (Ostbahnhof, Friedrichstrasse, Zoo) is really not much of a challenge. You just
    go to another platform and take an S-Bahn. \r\n\r\nA."

    I used the Hauptbahnhof as a transfer point to the S-bahn on twelve occasions,
    day and night. The total aggregate time I spent waiting for S-bahn trains on the
    upper Bahnsteig during those twelve journeys was about ninety seconds.\r\n\r\nYet,
    if you live in Charlottenberg and use the ICE frequently, you must transfer to
    the S-bahn upon arriving in Berlin. This is a major annoyance, to say the least.
    Also, there must be fears that the new Hauptbahnhof will overshadow the efficiency,
    charm, and character of the other Berlin stations, which are world-class facilities
    in their own right.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berlinHaupt2_5543.jpg]"
