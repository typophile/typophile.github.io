body: "My work pal and I recently proposed some covers for a 2006 agenda which is
  going to contain sales tactics and advice for sales people. Our client returned
  them telling us that \"people\" didn\xB4t like them, that they were boring and weren't
  creative or modern.\r\n\r\nI know this has not been one of our best works (mainly
  because of limited time and client budget) and that it\xB4s pretty plain, but is
  this really as bad as she said?\r\n\r\nHere are some sketches of a couple of proposals:\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Our client is a retired teacher who has written a couple of fairly successful
    books and wants to invest her capital into this product and sell it to small and
    mid sized companies like departamental stores, car agencies, insurance agencies
    and any company dealing with detailed sales work.\r\n\r\nThe agenda is meant to
    be for the average sales person, but bought by their bosses.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    up and down arrows on the 1st file.

    meant to stand for an achieved transaction in the first proposal and also are
    meant to contextuallice into the realm of \r\nstrategy and planification in both
    proposals.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: 'My problem with the designs is one: Arrow graphics for sales are over done.
    two: Everything on the cover is fighting for attention. Prioritize the information.
    If Tactica is the most important statement, make it dominate. Make Agenda and
    2006 small. Think of process over graphics, maybe a textured cover weight paper
    could carry message. Just some thoughts'

  body: "The ideas in the covers aren't bad as designs on their own, and I'm a sucker
    for elegance/simplicity. However, many of the layouts feel like first passes,
    rather than finished ones. Plus, as Dan said, the hierarchy isn't working yet,
    which is often harder than one expects with only 3 elements on the page. Overall,
    I prefer the black designs to the white ones. I like the blue and red arrows in
    'Tactica', too.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, sales people love pop, sizzle, sexiness,
    and any other poorly articulated term for a lot of stuff going on and crazy visual
    effects. In that sense, your designs my not strike the target audience where it
    counts, so that's probably why your client didn't like them.\r\n\r\nAgain, not
    bad, but could be better."

  body: "You could put some really cheasy photoshop work in there, whith everybodies
    picture with blurry edges and big 'ol smiles, lots of color, Arial or Times roman
    embossed in photoshop\r\n\r\n... I'll bet you 20 they'd love it.\r\n\r\nBut seriously,
    I agree with the first pass and hierarchy comments by crugen... I think the blue
    and red arrows are a possibility, but at this point weaken the headline, makes
    it feel a bit indecisive.  Try integrating the arrows into the background, having
    them move through the headline, don't know how, just experiment.\r\n\r\nEric"
