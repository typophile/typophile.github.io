body: 'I hope someone is still up and can help me on this.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always
  used PC and had several problems on some os the works I&#39;ve done on Xpress regarding
  the fonts and mac transmigration. The last one was a CD where I&#39;ve used Requiem,
  built the deisgn on Xpress and as the printing of the films would be made on Germany,
  so I&#39;ve sent the files to them. The result was a disaster, the font output gave
  me type A LOT SMALLER. They never replied to my technical question, so now that
  I&#39;m on the process of printing a new work on a mac I question: <BR> <BR>1. I&#39;ve
  switched to InDesign. Just finished a new work and will develop the films tomorrow.
  Before outputing to films, I&#39;ve printed the same page using a PDF output &#40;font
  included&#41; and the Indesign document with the font converted to paths. There
  is a hugeeeeee diference. The convert to path gives the text a more black text.
  The PDF print is much more soft. Would you print the FILMS from the Indesign with
  the fonts &#40;would have to give them to the films company, install etc&#41; or
  use the convert to paths? <BR> <BR>2. That Requiem example, where I got a so much
  smaller type, can anyone explain? I can place a PDF with the original PC output
  and a photo of the final artwork. <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

  body: 'Interestingly, neither of these issues really has anything to do with PC
    versus Mac. They&#39;re both general workflow issues. There are two things going
    on: <BR> <BR>- when outputting a PDF from Acrobat, in the print dialog there is
    an option &#40;in English, in Acrobat 6&#41; in the &#34;Paper handling&#34; section
    called &#34;Paper scaling&#34; with the setting &#34;shrink to paper.&#34; This
    is often ON and needs to be set instead to &#34;None.&#34; <BR> <BR>- Converting
    text to outlines always results in slightly heavier text, due to differences in
    the way PostScript fills text as opposed to graphics. <BR> <BR>I hope this is
    helpful. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Thanks Thomas.~Tomorrow I&#39;ll upload images of that particular problem
    I had. I also believe that it was somekind of &#34;human&#34; error, tomorrow
    we&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR>&#34;Slightly&#34;. hum... Interesting, maybe I did printed
    the PDF with that option selected. As a general rule do the typophiles people
    make Films with fonts or with convert to paths?
