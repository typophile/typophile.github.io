  body: "Hi Schickele - \r\n\r\nMany thanks. I thought maybe the reason I couldn't
    find an exact match was because it had been customized.\r\n\r\nAre you able to
    recommend a company or person who could re-create this custom font? (That is,
    supply a set of fonts with the modified 'G' and 'a').\r\n\r\nActually - is this
    legal??\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPhilip "

  body: "ITC\u2019s EULA (hard to find) states: \u201C13. You may not alter Font Software
    for the purpose of adding any functionality which such Font Software did not have
    when delivered to you ...\u201D So you are not allowed to modify Avant Garde yourself.
    If you only want these particular letters adjusted, I\u2019d just contact them
    directly. If you want to create a font in the same vein from scratch, why not
    contact a type foundry/type designer you admire? I can certainly recommend someone.
    If you have a budget, that is."
