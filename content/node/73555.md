    Typecon. But there\u2019s nothing stopping you from taking the project on. Although
    you might try to pick something better than Pilcrows\u2014they\u2019re not the
    most useful of symbols."

    composition, rather than interpretations of a single character - which ends up
    being interpretations of a single character, but more versatile.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd favour the pilcrow over the Delta, as it offers much greater possibility
    for distinctiveness and elaboration.
