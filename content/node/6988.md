body: I never thought this day would come, but... <BR>I am experimenting with vector
  paint tools in fontlab. <BR> <BR>I know you can draw a single line with the pencil
  tool. You can draw a brushed line with the brush. But can you draw a single line,
  tweek the curves, and then apply a brush stroke to it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve check the
  manual and Learn FL Fast and haven&#39;t found the answer. Thanks! <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: you sure can randy! go to outline -&#62; stroke and then a dialog box should
    pop up that lets you choose your brush options and then voila! yer in bidness!
    at least i think that&#39;s how it works. i haven&#39;t done it too much. just
    be sure to let us see yer beautiful results, please. ;^&#41;

  body: 'Right! I knew it was in there somewhere, thanks.  <BR> <BR>Attached is the
    first letter digitized: q. It is from a handwiting sample from my grandmother,
    Ardeth. She is in the early stages of what looks like Parkinsons. When she was
    having a good day and her hand was steady, I asked my mom to walk her through
    a basic set. The results are beautiful, but it was done with a cheap ball point
    pen. As this is a fun side project for me, I just wanted to experiment with adding
    a calligraphic stoke to the monoline. <BR> <BR>As with most computer auto-features,
    it&#39;s no substitute for the real thing. Fine penmanship &#40;penwomanship&#41;,
    where art thou? Thanks for the info though.  <BR> <BR>R <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/50509.gif"

  body: amazing project, randy. <BR> <BR>keep us updated as the project progresses..
    <BR> <BR>for me, the trickyest thing would be generating a &#42;connected&#42;
    script..it&#39;s a spacing/kerning thing i guess

  body: To be clear, the above wasn&#39;t done using the stroke.  When I stroked it
    the modulation looked off no matter how it adjusted the angles and widths. Probably
    because people arent plotters and we rotate when we draw. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;
    i&#39;ve been digitizing my own granny&#39;s handwriting <BR> <BR>Hopefully the
    decenders are shorter in her writing :-&#41; <BR> <BR>R
