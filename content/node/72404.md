body: I googled a lot and still couldn't find a simple answer or a solution for this.
  I created two very similar documents, one with InDesign, another with Word 2010.
  Exported to pdf, the quality of the pdf produced in Word is much worse. Any reason
  why?

  body: InDesign is made by Adobe and Adobe controls PDF technology; other companies
    must get a license from Adobe. It's hard to tell what's happening in your particular
    situation without seeing the PDFs, but often in lower-quality PDFs the type and
    vector graphics look okay but bitmapped graphics like photos are reproduced in
    lower quality, similar to what happens if you make a PDF in InDesign and choose
    "smallest file size" as the quality setting (rather than one of the higher-quality
    setting).

    Offoce 2010 are raster images of the document in a PDF wrapper, or that what it

    is about the Arno fonts that Word didn't like, and not sure if Word doesn't like

    special custom version and will then check with Word team.
