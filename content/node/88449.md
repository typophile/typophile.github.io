body: "I have FontLab 5.04 installed on a Windows Vista system, and have had Python
  2.7 installed on the same system for a long time. But FontLab has always insisted
  that \"Python is not installed\", which obviously is not true. How can I convince
  FontLab that Python is present? I want to use my licensed RMX tools. Is my Python
  too new? Do I really have to find an outdated build to make it work with FontLab?\r\n\r\n"

    for other purposes outside of FontLab, it's a shame to have to have to downgrade."

  body: Indeed. I use Python for lots-of-stuff, so this is a nuisance. FontLab is
    very far from cheap; that kind of money should really buy us regular maintenance
    upgrades too.

    installed on Windows.

    No issues with the system paths and such? Will check it out - nothing worse than
    a bad assumption.\r\nAny gotchas to be aware of?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
