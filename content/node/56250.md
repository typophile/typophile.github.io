body: "Hi typophiles.\r\n\r\nI'm in a hurry and I need a script font, that needs to
  be the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Must look handwritten with a pen (no explicit caligraphy
  and as little stroke variation as possible)</li>\r\n<li>Must serve masculine and
  feminine signatures.</li>\r\n<li>Must be readable</li>\r\n<li>Must have central/eastern
  european characters (\u010D\u010C\u0161\u0160\u017E\u017D\u0107\u0106\u0111\u0110)</li>\r\n<li>Must
  have dignity, because it will be used for signatures of strong personality and successful
  individuals</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI'm having some difficulty choosing one. It also
  looks there's not much choice around. There's lot of caligraphic script fonts. Or
  scripts written with caligraphic pens... But not my required style fonts...\r\n\r\nI'm
  seriously flirting with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/ivana-script/|Ivana
  Script]]. Does it stand my measures?\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest?"

  body: Ivana is a little sloppy and not so readable. For your needs I'd go with <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/handsome_pro_ot/">Handsome
    Pro</a>. Unfortunately no CE characters. I would ask [[Nick Shinn]] to add them.

  body: Hmm, I reread your request. You want to use the same font for the signatures
    of many different people?

  body: "Yes. I need it strictly for singatures. Masculine, feminine.\r\nThanks for
    the suggestion of Handsome Pro. I would expect of a Pro font to have all kinds
    of letters in it as they are with ITC or Adobe... Unfortunatelly this one doesn't
    have \u010D\u010C, \u0107\u0106, \u0111\u0110 as you already mentioned anyway.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I think that Handsome font may not be the best as false signeture font for let's
    say... Bill Gates. I don't think it would look legitimate. Anyone could tell it's
    made up.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Thanks and welcome any other suggestions.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "@Florian: Caflish Script Pro does in did look very nice, but you can easily
    tell it's digitized. It does have every character I need though.\r\n\r\n@Manlio:
    Nice discovery. Thank you. Do you think it's a bit feminine with all these large
    rounded letters? And very upright. I guess determined people have slant in their
    handwritting \"pushing\" things forward. Hvala.\r\n\r\nAnything else?\r\nStill
    looks like I prefer Ivana Script over others.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    have, some not. If the signatures are in the same document or in different documents
    that can be viewed at the same time, any typeface you are going to use can't do
    the trick.\r\nMy suggestion could sound silly since I don't know enough about
    your project, but maybe you could ask people you know to write down the signatures
    and scan the best results."

  body: "Well. The difference being calligraphers tend to make artistic strokes with
    calligraphic pen. People usually don't write that beautiful. We tend to write
    \"ugly\" and barely readable. And we use regular pens that don't produce variable
    stroke weight. At least not to the same degree as most calligraphic pens do (depends
    on the tip, but still).\r\n\r\nThat's how I see it.\r\n\r\nThat's why I wanted
    a still readable type, that would look more natural (not artistic) with not much
    stroke variation.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    It was drawn using my own every-day handwriting with a pen. A preliminary study
    was done to improve its readability. Letters have various angles that helps making
    the whole thing look realistic as a handwriting, and it covers eastern European
    languages.

    nib and the round tip of a ballpoint.
