  shapes of a and g in the English language? \r\nFrom what I could gather, the common
  practices seems to be to have two groups: the single-story shapes and the double-story
  shapes. But until now, I fail to see the formal logic behind that. \r\nIf I take
  the double-story a and turn it upside down, I then get, what is referred to as single-story
  shape of the g \u2013 even though this is exactly the same shape. So what actually
  are then the \u201Cstories\u201D of that character? \r\n\r\nTherefore my personal
  logic would be to name the different possibilities:\r\nsingle-story a\r\ndouble-story
  a\r\ndouble-story g (because it is basically an upside down double-story a)\r\nand
  three(!)-story g\r\n\r\nBut maybe I am missing something \u2026"

  body: "Ralf's original question can be explained away by extending the metaphor.
    Think of the baseline as ground level. A two-story building has two floors above
    ground level; you don't count the basement if it has one.\r\n\r\nI think I've
    identified the best clear way to describe the two main types of g without running
    into exceptions. The verticals of letters such as b, d, p, q are stems. Any g
    whose tail drops down from the right side is a <em>stemmed g</em>, and others
    such as the typical binocular g are <em>unstemmed</em>."

  body: I like "the sexy, curvy letter". If you've practised calligraphy you'll know
    that that g feels <strong>so</strong> good when you get it right; and usually,
    if you don't get it right, you know it's not right soon after you've started the
    lower curve.
