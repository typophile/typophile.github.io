    else? It mustn't be on FontLab. All I need is something that focuses on pixel
    fonts creation."

    ). It's a $29.97 application that comes with a Python plugin for FontLab Studio
    that helps creating pixelfonts. Please check the FontFlasher FAQ (http://fontlab.com/FontLab-Product-Support/FontLab-FAQs/FAQ-FontFlasher/
    ) for installation tips for the plugin in FontLab Studio 5 (there are some manual
    steps you need to perform). \r\n\r\nA."

  body: Thank you, Adam. Can I assume there aren't too many differences between 4.5
    and 5.02 when it comes to FontFlasher related functionality? I was looking to
    produce windows ttf and mac suitcase fonts with some grey shading.

    don't need any special software\r\nto make grayscale pixelfonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, \r\n\r\nyou don't need any \"special\" software to make any kinds
    of fonts. You can always write the binary .ttf code by hand. It just takes a little
    bit of skill. FontFlasher or the FontLab Pixel tool (that comes with FontFlasher)
    does not directly support greyscale pixelfonts since some greyscale pixelfont
    creation techniques seem to be covered by U.S. patents and are therefore not available
    for general public. Also, the simulation of greyscale in pixelfonts differs depending
    on the rasterizer used. \r\n\r\nHowever, you can still use the Pixel tool for
    FontLab/FontLab Studio to create greyscale pixelfonts. You just need to specify
    a 2x or 3x or 4x finer grid in the tool, and then you can turn the \"subpixels\"
    on and off. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

    thought you knew: Jose Benavides released the patent for general use.\r\nSo please
    put gs pixelfont support in all your apps!  :-)\r\n\r\n> You just need to specify

    everything sound so simple...  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
