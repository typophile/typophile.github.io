  of knowledge and generosity amongst all users.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, would anyone
  be so kind as to help me identify the type used by CAROLINA HERRERA in their logo
  (www.carolinaherrera.com)? I would be ever so grateful as it is for a project which
  has this coming Friday as deadline.\r\n\r\nThank you all!\r\n"

  body: "I'd like to explain my remark earlier, and the only reason I said \"Which
    one?\" is because I genuinely think this is the greatest outfit ever and I'm being
    <em>extremely</em> nitpicky here.\r\n\r\nWhen it is specifically stated that the
    I.D. request is related to a job with a deadline, it's not enough to just point
    out a name, but actually linking to a downloadable font would be nice. Again,
    great work all around, just dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's. :^)"

  body: The Engravers to which I was referring is from Monotype. But, upon looking
    more closely at it, I realize it isn't a match. Monotype's version has bracketing
    on the serifs. It isn't Orange Italic either.

    body: "Thank you all ever so much, if you wise people couldn\xB4t find the exact
      match, it probably doesn\xB4t exist :), having been built on purpouse, which
      of course one would expect for such brand. Having said that, they've played
      around with different fonts through time...\r\n\r\nNever the less, with the
      closest of matches, courtesy of you all, I will attempt to do what's been requested
      of me. I might even be brave enough to post the result.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nW."

  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is creating their version of Engravers
    Roman, but under license from URW++, features 2 uppercase character sets - bigger
    for "uppercase" and smaller for "lowercase" - and comes in the styles of regular
    and bold.      The typeface name will be called "Gravure" and'll appear on two
    of SoftMaker's premium-quality typeface collections - "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for
    home users) and "infiniType 4" (for designers) - both being released in May 27,
    2014.
