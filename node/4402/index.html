		<div class="commentbody">The words &quot;ideas with vision&quot; mean absolutely nothing. Global Investment is rather vague, is it investing globally for clients or is it investing in global markets like a countries economy. I don't get the orange, its pretty but not conserative, I also don't get the shape of the orange mark, is it a person? Just some thoughts, nothing mean meant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thnx for the feedback.  The client I am working for is through the sba, small business association, of Oakland.  The owner of Global Investments co. already registered her ficticious name of business as the one stated above. I can agree its a very generic name and global is not even about of her mission statement. but I cant get her to change the name. its what she wants. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>MY school has a program with sba to help small companies getting online. Her orginal logal was some clip art. The logo wasnt really thought out well because she doesnt have a big idea. If you know what i mean. Anyways, she wanted something that was friendly. The cirlces are just some thing I was playing around with and came up with a person.  I guess its hard to tell I, and I should rethink the logo but I fear we dont have time. Do to our scope of the project.  I feel though  that these small business's do need some identity and branding strategy's. I suggested to my teacher that the graphic department should help these company's with their identities because since we are an html class we dont have time to develop it..   <BR> <BR>Anways, I sad to hear its hard to read. and ideas with visions is her tagline, but it doesnt make sense either.</div>
