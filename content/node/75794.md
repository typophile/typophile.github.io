    the name of the document Adobe put out -- maybe someone can add that -- but if
    a character is *named* with the correct components as a Unicode number, it will
    be extracted from a PDF in proper Unicode. The program picks up on \"uni\", counts
    four digits for the first character, the next four for a second, and the next
    four for a third. I believe 12 digits (three characters) is all it will parse.\r\n\r\nI
    would use 0041 + 0328 + 0301, e.g., uni004103280301 as the name, which lists the
    bottom diacritical character first. But I believe it will parse with either diacritical
    given first."

  body: "This isn't the document I was thinking of (I'll try to rummage it up at work
    Monday if you are still interest), but does show Adobe's thoughts on the matter:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html\r\n\r\nQuoting
    \ part:\r\n\r\nThe glyph name is expressed as the prefix \"uni\" followed by two
    or more sequences of four hexadecimal digits. Each sequence of four digit hexadecimal
    digits indicates the Unicode scalar values of the standard Unicode characters,
    in order.\r\n\r\nFor example, the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH WITH CIRCUMFLEX
    AND GRAVE, which is not in Unicode, should be named \"uni01B703020300\", since
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH is at U+01B7, COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT is at U+0302,
    and COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT is at U+0300.\r\n\r\nA maximum of 7 name components
    is available with this format, due to glyph name length restrictions."

  body: "Thanks Charles,\r\n\r\nI'd thought that A_uni0328_acutecomb would also be
    extracted correctly since it would be treated as a ligature and decomposed into
    its component parts, but I'll adopt your suggestion if you've seen this recommended.
    I'd looked through a number of adobe documents on naming but hadn't found anything
    really definitive on the subject.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    includes a note on *stability*:\r\n\r\n<cite>The specification consists of the
    Adobe Glyph List (AGL), a mapping of specific names to Unicode values, and of
    rules for decomposing glyph names. Because it is anticipated that this specification
    will be implemented in many pieces of software, and that revising consistently
    all those implementations is unlikely, this specification is intended to be stable,
    i.e. never revised.</cite>"
