body: "I am curious what people think about the designing of multi-lingual scripts
  (i.e typographic matchmaking). \r\n\r\nIs there perhaps a dialectic at work? I mean
  that while on the one hand the designing of multi-script families seems to be a
  way of visually representing rising multi-culturalism and the displacement of peoples
  of different backgrounds. \r\nAn appeal in type for harmony in the \"Contact Zone\"!?\r\nBut
  then could economic factors be brought to bear on this as well (i.e. multi-script
  design perhaps reflecting a convergence with purely capitalist interests, using
  the vision of cultural harmony as smokescreen??).\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems to be
  a developing area I'd also sure like to know about historical precedents of scripts
  being designed side by side. \r\nIs this the future of type design? Where does it
  lead?\r\n(and pardon if my words be poorly formulated)"

    typographic matchmaking and related OpenType features: <a href=\"http://www.urwpp.de/graphic/pdf/URW++_GlobalFonts.pdf\">Peter
    Rosenfeld (URW++) on \u2018Global Fonts\u2019 </a> [PDF, 7.8mb]\r\nIt\u2019s in
    German, but that should be no problem as it mainly consists of letterforms, statistics
    etc. \r\nF"

  body: "Might want to look at the ClearType Collection fonts and the booklet \"Now
    Read This\" - the book has details of how each typeface was conceived from the
    get go to support a pan-European glyph and feature set.\r\n\r\nApart from that
    there should be material online around the idea that for a duo-script font, say
    one supporting English and Armenian, you need to produce two versions, one for
    use when Armenian is the dominant script used in a document and one for use when
    English is the dominant language. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

    a desire to serve the needs of the world.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps it's just a good thing
    that sometimes the two of them coincide, no?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Of all the type designers I have met, I don't believe I have ever met one
    with overriding capitalist interests. There just isn't enough money to be made
    in the field to satiate that kind of desire. I think they just like the challenge
    of multiscript work and love the look of the several alphabets they work with.
    It is more like they thought, \"I wonder what this face would look like in Cyrillic?\"
    rather than, \"I'll bet I can rake in big bucks from those Ruskies if I do a Cyrillic
    version, too.\":-) \r\n\r\nThey just do it for the love of letters.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

    Greek, and Cherokee along with very broadly applied Latin in [[http://typophile.com/node/28862|the
    font I'm working on,]] but I sure wouldn't mind it.

  body: "You might want to look at typeface design in Japan, where to serve the needs
    of the Japanese written language, one needs to produce designs for hiragana, katakana,
    kanji, and romaji (the Latin alphabet), not to mention Arabic numerals, that work
    together in text. A Japanese newspaper article will often require all of these
    different scripts to work seamlessly. Is it multiculturalism or capitalism at
    work? Hard to say. Perhaps a willingness to represent different origins in Japanese
    vocabulary through different scripts is at work here, although it's certainly
    more complicated than that.\r\n\r\nIn Korea, hangul (the Korean alphabet) and
    Chinese characters tended to be used together in the past because of the prestige
    of the difficult-to-learn Chinese characters, but 99% of the texts produced today
    are written exclusively in hangul. Typefaces for Korean use are designed to include
    hangul (Korean alphabet) and Latin as a minimum requirement. Most Korean type
    designs don't include Chinese characters to match the hangul, since the time and/or
    design expertise they require isn't usually available. The understanding is that
    one can choose from the handful of those fonts that include Chinese characters
    to match the hangul design.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether in the future, Korean type
    designers who want to include Chinese characters will find it desirable to collaborate
    with Japanese and other non-Korean designers who have more expertise and manpower
    in producing Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nBecause of the different scripts required
    and the sheer volume of work in producing kanji alone (several thousands glyphs
    are needed), type design in Japan is already largely a collaborative process,
    even in the age of font-design software.\r\n\r\nFor a fascinating example of such
    collaborative efforts that pool the expertise of designers working in different
    scripts, take a look at the recent <a href=\"http://www.khtt.net/artefact-106-en.html\">Typographic
    Matchmaking Project</a> that brought together Dutch and Arab designers to produce
    Arabic designs to harmonize with existing faces by Dutch designers."
