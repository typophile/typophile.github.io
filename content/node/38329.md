  need to know the name of these TWO fonts\r\nin this picture (arrows). I think, it
  must be \r\n50s fonts or any retro-types.\r\n\r\nThey are from an old german movie-poster
  \r\nfrom the 50s.\r\n\r\nIt would be sooo nice, if you could \r\nhelp me to identify
  them.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nGigi\r\n\r\n\r\n*(sorry for my bad english) ;)"

    In the future, please start a new topic if you have a different typeface to ID.
