  body: It's really nice, very legible. In fact, some of the more idiosyncratic features
    might not even be needed - I think it might be even better without the idiosyncratic
    broken O and semi-serifs. I love the small sizes!

  body: I'd say decide on a target use (and especially size) for this. The heaviness
    of it offers the legibility at smaller sizes that Birdseeding mentioned, but there
    those "ideosyncratic features" are lost (if not counterproductive). On the other
    hand if you are aiming at a larger display font, you may want to reduce the heaviness.
