body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nIm looking for some pointers and rules to start working
  with a light and bold weight of a regular I have made. (My typography is a geometric
  sans serif like Futura and Avant Garde) \r\n\r\n\u2013 Is there a special set of
  proportions between horizontal and vertical lines, when making a thinner and bolder
  weight? Thinking about thickness and width\r\n\r\n\u2013 What about the spacing
  and kerning \u2013 Does it change?\r\n\r\n\u2013 Whats the experince with making
  a general 'action' in fontlab, where You make all the letters thinner or bolder,
  and then afterwards creating the necessary adjustments?\r\n\r\nThe questions might
  seem a little naive, but i need to be a 100% sure about what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nAny
  entries on the subject will be gladly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank You very much,\r\n\r\nGS"
