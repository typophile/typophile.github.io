body: "Quick question: I have Snow Leopard now, so [some of] the system fonts are
  TTCs. Since I'm very much a type design learner I like to open fonts and study the
  outlines up close; but now FontLab says it can't handle TTCs. :-(  Is there any
  way to make Fontlab accept these files? Or do I need to revert to typing the glyphs
  in question in Illustrator and converting to outlines to see them up close?\r\nThanks
  for input."

  body: "A TTC is a regular TTF and then some more: it contains the usual tables for
    one single TTF, <em>plus</em> any number of additional font sections that share
    some of its tables with the 'base' font and have some private tables.\r\n\r\n(And
    I am surprised FontLab didn't know that. Perhaps they <em>do</em>, but it's too
    hard to switch from a one-file-one-font-outline paradigm. (They could do something
    like, on opening a TTC, ask \"What section do ya want?\"))\r\n\r\nI'm fairly familiar
    with the TTC tables; perhaps it's not too difficult to write a 'converter' that
    creates at least a single file of the 'base font' (and perhaps (oh my!) of the
    other fonts as well).\r\n\r\n... No promises, though.\r\n\r\n...... Besides, I
    bet this is one of those forbidden things you sometimes hear about."

  body: I think you can use ttx.py (from the <a href="http://www.robofab.org/download/index.html">Robofab</a>
    Python module library) to dump a TTC into xml. And then probably rebuild separate
    TTFs from there.

    much knowledge has been lost.\"\r\n\r\n(It seems you pay for the MBs, not for
    any intellectual investment. A cursory glance shows it's a complete [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/|FontForge]]
    distro -- fontforge, fontimage, fontlint, and sfddiff --, glued together and given
    a nice interface with RealBasic. Even comes with all original FF interface icons
    and man pages. Note To Self -- try to run it!)"

  body: "Hm, thanks guys. I guess hoping for an easy and legal solution was a bit
    too optimistic :-\\ \u2026 I guess I'll just look at these fonts in Illustrator
    for now \u2013 most times that should be sufficient for what I need, if not as
    convenient. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if FontLab 6 will have TTC support?\r\nAnd
    can FontForge open TTCs? Maybe I should just install that too."

    Opening: [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/filemenu.html#Open|FontForge -> Open]]\r\n\r\n(coincidentally
    addressing what I said about FontLab: \"When opening a TTC file, or a mac dfont
    -- files which potentially contain several fonts -- you will be given a dlg showing
    a list of all fonts in the file, you get to pick which you want to open.\")\r\n\r\nSaving:
    [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/generate.html#GenerateTTC|FontForge -> Generate
    Fonts (Generate TTC)]]\r\n\r\nGetting the thing to run seems to be a hit-and-miss
    affair. I had mixed feelings about my trying to run it under Cygwin (my Windows
    machine). It froze up every 30 sec, and boy! was it ever <strong>ugly</strong>!
    Perhaps I'll try again on my Mac."

  body: "Just to clarify some things.\r\n\r\n1. Fontlab Studio was never supposed
    to support TTC fonts. There is another product from Fontlab to do this: http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\r\n2.
    New TTC fonts introduced in Snow Leopard are a little bit different from those
    on Windows. Apple took font data from the data fork, compressed it and put in
    the 'cmpf' resource in the resource fork of the file. So new ttc fonts are now
    resource-based files.\r\n\r\n<cite>Does anyone know if FontLab 6 will have TTC
    support?</cite>\r\n\r\nNobody knows. ;)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: 'Apart from the difficulty of running it on a Mac or PC, Font Forge is quite
    ugly, compared to the elegant GUI and user-friendly functions of Fontlab. But
    from my limited experience FF seems strictly professional in treating the basics,
    for example it lets the user see which tables are associated with which font.
    Font Forge installs with one click on any Linux operating system and runs smoothly
    in its native habitat. I tried it from a Ubuntu OS installed temporarily from
    a USB key on a homeless PC laptop that does not even have a hard disc - and it
    is all open source. See http://www.linuxliveusb.com/ . FF is downloaded as a package
    from within Ubuntu. '
