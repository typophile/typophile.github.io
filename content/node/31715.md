body: "HI all,\r\nI\u2019ve had this problem testing fonts on PC for a week now so
  any help would be greatly appreicated.\r\n\r\nI have an opentype font in TTF and
  OTF flavours, both work fine on the Mac platform. When trying to test on the PC
  platform only one of the flavours work. If I test on one PC it\u2019s the TTF that
  works and if I test on a different seperate PC it\u2019s the OTF that works.\r\n\r\nI
  only install one font at a time and all applications are closed when installing
  the fonts.\r\n\r\nMy order is this:\r\n1. Close all appliactions, install font files
  into fonts folder (TTF)\r\n2. Open application and test - font will work fine.\r\n3.
  Close application and remove fonts from fonts folder and empty trash\r\n4. Restart
  system to make sure.\r\n5. Install other flavour of font (OTF) and test in application.\r\n\r\nThis
  second font flavours won\u2019t work in the application. Do PC have a font cache
  like Mac and is there a way I can remove. or what else can I try.\r\n\r\nc."

  body: "Miguel,\r\n\r\nIt's adobe applications that the fonts don't work with - Indesign,
    Illustratot and Photoshop. The fonts seem to work fine with Windows apps. like
    Word. When the fonts don't work the name shows in the font list and I can click
    them but the text goes blank. \r\n\r\nIf I have \"The quick brown fox\u2026\"
    set in say Arial and then change the font to the font I'm testing, the text disappears
    and that weight of the font is removed form the font list.\r\n\r\nThe font flavours
    that don't work changes between machines, one machine works with the TTF and not
    the OTF, while a second machine the OTF works and not the TTF. This I why I thought
    it might be a cache problem to do with which font flavour I installed first, although
    I complete remove the first font I considered it might corrupt the second font
    installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nc.  \r\n"

  body: 'I had a similar problem with CFF-flavored Opentype fonts and PS Type 1 fonts
    on the PC. I installed the OTF font first for testing, then uninstalled it and
    attempted to install the PS font of the same name. I got an error message saying
    the font file was damaged. We will probably need to send up a Phinn-signal for
    this one, because I believe that the Adobe Font Handler is responsible for the
    problem: all I can gather is that, once a font with a certain name is installed,
    the Font Handler looks for other instances/formats of that font, and disables
    them in some way or another.'

  body: "If you test different flavors of otherwise \"same\" OTFs, you <cite>must</cite>
    clear all font caches -- both Adobe's AdobeFnt*.lst and the OS's -- before installing
    the other flavor.\r\nAs regards Windows, perhaps somebody else can jump in and
    tell how to delete them properly.\r\n\r\nThere was (is?) a problem with testing
    different flavors of OTFs in the Windows-version of InDesign. Say, you install
    and test the PS-OTFs first, deinstall the fonts, then install the TT-OTFs, InDesign
    still has the information that fonts were PS-OTFs and looks for PS-outline which
    are not present in TT-OTFs. (If you place the cursor where was text before, you'll
    notice that the glyph's metrics are there, but it just doesn't render the outlines.)\r\nIf
    I remember correctly, it is irrelevant if you test PS or TT flavor OTFs first.\r\nI
    thought this bug is removed already, but since you write \"but I get nothing just
    a blank text box\" it seems it isn't.\r\n\r\nSo it's important to remove all references
    (caches) to the previously installed different-flavor OTFs."

    the OTF version to try that, but now that isn't working.\r\n\r\nI've spent far
