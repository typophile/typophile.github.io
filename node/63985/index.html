  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm considering purchasing either Skolar or Mokka, but considering the price of four basic styles will run me, I want to be certain before I buy. I've looked at online specimens of both, but in the past, I've fount that what may look great in that setting, or even in downloaded PDF specimens, ends up looking awful on-screen in Microsoft Word. (Might this be because I'm using Windows, and perhaps these typefaces were designed largely by Mac users for Mac users?)

I'm not looking for free fonts, or to rip off foundries. What I'm hoping is that someone might be willing to set the attached word document (at least I think it's attached) in either Mokka or Skolar (ideally both, if you can), and embed the fonts so that they'll appear when I open the document. That way, I'll be able to see what they'll look like in actual use, without getting additional access to them before buying. (my email is mikebaranowski@gmail.com)

Thanks so much in advance to anyone willing to help me out. I know it's asking a lot, and I appreciate your assistance.

I've tried ClearType tuning, turning ClearType off, and pretty much everything else. And I've ended up concluding that some fonts display poorly on Word in Windows (for whatever reason). I get that there's no real financial incentive to catering to the very small group of folks in my situation, but it sure would be nice to be able to purchase some fonts that display as nicely in the application I use all the time as they do in print.</div>

May it be, that the fonts, that are not looking good on your screen, are PostScript flavored fonts? It’s normal, that they don’t look as good as well hinted TrueType flavored fonts in small sizes on screen.</div>

The fact that you don’t like the PDF rendering, suggests that like many Windows users your preference has been tuned to crisp rendering of Windows and Office bundled fonts like Calibri and Cambria under Windows “GDI rendering”. These TrueType based OpenType fonts have had a level of hinting investment that few third-party font vendors can justify. Occasionally corporate clients, looking to roll out a corporate font across thousands of desktops, might be willing to invest in having a font hinted, but typically for font vendors selling to graphic designers (who are happy with the way Adobe apps render type) would have no need to. So really you have three options, live with the rendering, pick different fonts, or pay to have the fonts hinted.

I've set it for long running text at sizes from 10-11 points and there's something that just doesn't feel right about it. Maybe I've become too accustomed to using warm, flowing faces like Dolly or Feijoa, but there's something rather jarring and distracting about Skolar when set at these sizes. I don't think it's appropriate for setting long running text, at least not at 10-11 points. The Skolar specimen pdf has it set smaller, I think, and it seems to work. 

It shines as a web or display font, however. Go figure. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The existence of these TrueType or TrueType-flavored specially-hinted fonts is a jolt to me. Considering that MS Windows is the preferred operating system (although perhaps not by type and graphic designers), and the ever-increasing level of digitally distributed documents, I should be thinking more about these fonts. Do they display better only with MS applications, like MS Word, or with other word processing and page layout (InDesign) programs as well? Do PDFs display better when viewed with Adobe Reader? How about with other PDF viewers? What about epub formats, which I don't really know too much about, viewed on Windows? Will these specially-hinted fonts continue to have a viewing advantage with Windows 7 and the upcoming Office 2010? Is anyone reviewing these fonts to see how much better they look?

What are the disadvantages of these fonts, besides limited font selection, cost, and, if the fonts are actually TrueType (as opposed to TrueType-flavored OpenType) as the Lucas fonts seem to be, no OpenType options?

And where should I be getting more information about this subject. Thanks, J.Tillman</div>

This is by no means surprising, as many fonts are not elaborately hinted.

But if those fonts had also looked bad when the finished document printed on your laser printer, then that would be surprising, and due to an actual discrepancy between what the font looks like in the specimen and what it looks like in actual use.</div>
