  body: "I don\u2019t see the benefit of having an extra place for \u2018Solved IDs\u2019.
    (I am also opposed to the idea of having style categories, see the comments in
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/65232\">this older thread</a>.)\r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion, this overcomplicates things. We have a well-established system that
    helps distinguish between solved and unsolved requests: the titles of solved threads
    are edited and marked with \u2018(x)\u2019, the solution and credits are added.
    \r\n\r\nMoving solved threads to an extra forum adds another work step that needs
    to be performed manually by the moderators. At the moment, we have around 15 requests
    per day, almost 500 every month. Just saying.\r\n\r\nAnd when to move them? We
    see so many threads where there is no easy, definitive answer \u2013 lettering
    work where suggesting alternates is all we can do, custom and modified type, obscure
    freebies, pre-digital typefaces etc. There is always someone who has some valuable
    information to add, even after the correct (or supposedly correct) answer was
    given (and credited). This openness would be lost if we immediately consign all
    threads that have received one plausible answer to some \u2018dead\u2019 archive.\r\nMost
    IDers are not willing to observe several separate lists.\r\n\r\nMany of the posters
    on the Type ID Board are first-time visitors, many of them not returning. If a
    solved thread was moved from the original forum, chances are the original poster
    would not find back the thread, and start another one on the same subject.\r\n\r\nBack
    to the question of benefit. Having an archive is a great thing. However, when
    people want to know which typeface is used for, say, the \u2018Kings Of Leon\u2019
    cover, they don\u2019t care whether this has been filed as \u2018solved\u2019,
    \u2018partially solved\u2019, \u2018yet unsolved\u2019, or maybe in a completely
    inappropriate place like the \u2018Design\u2019 forum. They should be able to
    perform a search and find the relevant thread(s). (At the moment, this is something
    that <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com/node/%20Kings%20of%20Leon\">works
    with external search engines</a>, but still is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/search/node/Kings%20Of%20Leon%20type%3Atypeid\">impossible
    using the built-in search</a>.)\r\n\r\nMy vote is for Riccado\u2019s latter suggestion:
    let\u2019s get rid off the \u2018Solved IDs\u2019 fora.\r\nFlorian"

  body: "I think Florian is perfectly right.\r\nAt most, we could borrow some functionality
    from the WTF forum, as in placing the solved status and attribution into some
    sort of metadata, in order to make titles less cluttered.\r\nEven if not, it would
    be nice if there were an interface for moderators with radio buttons (unsolved/solved/partially/not
    a font/similar, ecc.) and a text input for attribution (linked to the users database,
    of course).\r\nThen the system could be instructed either to display such information
    through the title or by other means."
