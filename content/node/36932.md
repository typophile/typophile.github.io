  body: 'Thanks! La Portenia is definitely close, nice typeface if a little ''neat''
    in comparison. I think the tattoo has a slight french feel to it, esp. to the
    capital A and L. '

  body: You could certainly go into Illustrator and bend and mold it to your heart's
    content. Or your arm's content, if that's where the tattoo's going.
