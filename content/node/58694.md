  to just one version or is it sometimes ok to mix them?\r\n\r\nThanks for any input!"

  body: "If you're ever tempted to stretch or squish a font, use the extended or condensed
    version instead.\r\n\r\nBut the greater benefits of an expanded font family come
    into play when setting complicated documents, such as magazines that need various
    styles to distinguish photo credits, captions, pull quotes, footnotes, etc. without
    detracting from the body text, headlines, and subheads, etc. Each of those could
    be of a different size, weight, width, and even a different variant specialized
    for very small or large display. Maps have need of many varied type styles to
    distinguish different feature types too. Examine a copy of National Geographic,
    where you can see examples in both of these situations."

  body: Some of the grotesque and neo-grotesque fonts out there are really wider than
    they need to be when used as copy, so a condensed weight can save paper and look
    better. For example, its common for designers to use Univers Condensed for copy
    and save the regular width for headlines.

  body: I totally agree James and cfish, but I also think that condensed and extended
    styles are pure evil and the inbreeds of comercial typography. There so many solutions
    with good typefaces that have small-caps, good italics/cursives and a bold style.
    Maybe extended and condensed type can serve a purpose in logo-design or posters,
    but some typefaces like Helvetica have so many styles that you can easily end
    up with a circus of unclear typography. We don't need 30 styles, just several
    good ones.

  body: "I think Condensed is far more useful than extended, for example, in the Madrid
    Metro, there is a limitted amount of space to use to put the name of each station.
    \ Sadly they switch to Arial Condensed from the normal Helvetica or just squash
    it, but this is when a well-done condensed variant could be useful.  In poetry,
    especially in translation, you might have a line that won't fit on one line.  I
    personally think it's rather unsightly to use the open bracket + rest of the line
    combination right justified and a condensed font most of the time would help out
    a lot.\r\n\r\nThat said, designing the condensed to 50% makes it obviously out
    of place.  Subtlety (as best possible, like the \xE6 lig) is key."

    is evil. Nothing wrong with using a well-designed face that may be wider or narrower
    than the norm. (What exactly is the norm? I haven't seen any specs as to exactly
    what each character width should be.)"

    condensed or extended, a relatively narrow style of typefaces by Luce (and picked
    up also by Fournier le jeune) were known as <em>Types Po\xE9tiques</em>. (cf.
    Updike, Vol. I, figs 176 & 183.)"

  body: "I don't know if it matters, but condensed and narrow versions of fonts are
    very important in signage. When you first set up a directory of any kind you try
    to plan for every contengency, start out with the normal scale, but it doesn't
    work all of the time. You always run into a name that will not fit but can't be
    shortened or made smaller. This saves you from squashing the font, which I don't
    allow unless otherwised ordered.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "phrostbyte64:\r\n\r\nYour right about the condensed type in signage. My only
    point was that all those condensed and extended styles are made for offering and
    selling more fonts by foundries. Because these styles are easy to make by interpolation
    you just need to extreme designs and interpolate everything in between. In my
    opinion if you need a condensed face for signage that gets a lot of readable characters
    on one line, design one that fits that purpose. An extended or condensed Helvetica
    is not what the initial idea was behind the typeface just some idea from the foundry
    to make more money out of it. But maybe I'm to traditionally biased. "

  body: "Sidney:\r\n\r\nTo some degree I agree with you. Some type designers don't
    do enough to design their condensed and extended fonts. They just throw them together
    to fill out a collection. That's almost as bad as stretching a font. Some fonts
    shouldn't have a condensed form. This doesn't stop people from buying and using
    them. I started a condensed version of a font I am working on and stopped when
    I realised that the only way to do it correctly was to start over. \r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    are in it for the money I guess. (that's a good way to destroy 600 years of tradition)"

    a type designer, I make things I like and generally will use. I don't take into

    to get the discussion going, but I still think the use of condensed and extended
    is limited. I am traditionally oriented and of course I'm not accusing anybody
    of the wrong use of type. I just want to make people realize that there are designers
    with opinions based on air and not knowledge and experience. We are working in
    a critical time of transition between techniques. From metal type to digital,
    it took almost 600 years for this to happen. The computer opened the world of
    design for the mass, which results in a lot of designers not being educated and
    capable. Keep tradition, history and most important quality alive.\r\n\r\nThanks
