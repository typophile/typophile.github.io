I wanted to see if I could add a workable lower case, and try my hand at my own version of the upper case and symbols in a style that would make for a reductivist addition to my Seriatim family &#40;now showing in the Sans Serif Critique Forum&#41;. <BR> <BR>The question behind the experiment is this: How much of each character can be removed while still allowing the human mind&#39;s phenomenon of &#34;gestalt recognition&#34; &#40;recognizing the whole&#41; to still resolve each individual character? <BR> <BR>The result seems to be very similar to a stencil font, but then it occurred to me that stencil fonts are another extension of this same question. In order to allow counters, etc., to remain in place in a stencil font, what parts of each character can be safely removed without compromising character recognition? Seriatim Gestalt simply takes it beyond the counters. <BR> <BR>As always, comments are appreciated and encouraged. <BR> <BR>David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I love this concept -- I&#39;m a big fan of J Hoefler&#39;s variant. you&#39;re goal, to include the lc is a truely valient one. you&#39;ve done a wonderfully modest job on the ligatures! also, the uc M is really standing out to my eye here, the diagonals assist in completing the shape quite well.  <BR> <BR>my overall impression is that you still have some research ahead of you. I&#39;m not certain the components you are emphasizing are the essential ones &#40;I&#39;m thinking of the lc k &amp; a at the moment&#41;. some of the characters seem less reductivist than decoratively geometric &#40;the lc p &amp; d, perhaps&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> &#62; some of the characters seem less reductivist than decoratively geometric <BR> <BR>Which leads directly to a central conundrum: <BR>A font consisting of &#34;gestalt-minimal&#34; shapes isn&#39;t necessarily something anybody would actually want to use... Which doesn&#39;t make it a bad effort, not at all. But a &#42;usable&#42; font &#40;as opposed to a truly experimental one, in the scientific/analytical sense&#41; has to strike a compromise between theory and aesthetics. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t read David&#39;s mind &#40;for which I should probably be thankful ;-&#41; but I wonder if he&#39;s worried about where this treacherous road leads, or if he&#39;s just enjoying the strange scenery &#40;and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, quite the contrary&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Sometimes even &#42;I&#42; don&#39;t want to read my own mind... :D <BR> <BR>Actually, you&#39;ve hit on something, though, Hrant -- this has been one of the more strange &#40;yet fun&#41; typographic forays I&#39;ve taken. <BR> <BR>The lower-case &#34;a&#34; was a startling accident, as I played with forming an &#34;a&#34; out of a reversed &#34;s&#34;. What you see above is what resulted. The upper-case &#34;M&#34; had a similar genesis, as I tinkered with the angles and strokes of the glyph. <BR> <BR>PlainClothes: <BR>I agree that this experiemnt is far from complete. I&#39;ll probably go ahead and release this typeface soon, after a few adjustments, but I&#39;ll continue the experimentation toward perhaps creating an even more reductivist version sometime in the future. <BR> <BR>David </div>
