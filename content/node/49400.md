  this question to the people here whom own this book also...when going trough the
  fonts on the disk i noticed that 'TheMix Arabic\" folder only contains 0kb TTF files,
  so they can't be opened, only thing that works in that folder is the readme pdf
  file.\r\n\r\nshouldn't this font normaly be included and working?....just asking
  to make sure :)\r\n\r\nthe book looks superb, can't wait to start reading!!"
