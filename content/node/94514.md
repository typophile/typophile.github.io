  various websites for hours but have not found it - although it is not especially
  novel. \r\n\r\nI think the easiest way to describe it is as follows: the left side
  of the characters (I am only using caps) is not included. So an \"E\" looks like
  three horizontal lines. And a D looks like a backwards C.  And a P looks like a
  small backwards C, raised up off the bottom line.  And an N looks like a tilted
  V. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what this is called, or where I can find it? \r\n\r\nTHANKS"

    How the OTHER characters or glyphs look is also important.  BTW - you should probably
    use the \"edit\" link to move this out of the Design forum into the Type ID forum.

    If you want a hand-written look for a small group, why not have someone hand-write
    them? \r\n\r\nI have a small pet-peeve re faux hand-written type that's clearly
    mechanical. Not saying there aren't good versions out there. Just sayin'."

    all these fonts seems rather unreadable to me, although I have to admit it depends
    on the actual text set - sometimes my eyes read the whole words and it's fine."
