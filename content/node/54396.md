  Steiner-Prag]]  referred to the spine of the book as its face, since it's the part
  that you look at when it's placed on a shelf. <em>Or something to that effect</em>.
  \r\nNow that I want to use it properly, I can't seem to find it. \r\n\r\nDo the
  words ring any bell, anyone?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\u0192"
