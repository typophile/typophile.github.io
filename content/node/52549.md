    to consult with you. He's super nice and he has studied in Lebanon, NY, The Netherlands,
    Qatar and Dubai. Aside from being far away, he has EXACTLY the skills you're looking
    for. Tell him he came highly recommended from someone who saw him speak in Doha,
    Qatar in 2004.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.atrissi.com/"
