  body: Dear Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Happy April Fools Day One and All! <BR> <BR>Finally
    years of planning have met their reward that I am fortunate enough to have pulled
    off perhaps the most obscure practical joke ever, knowing only a handful of people
    in the world would truly &#39;get it&#39; . . . Consider it my joybuzzer to the
    Type World! <BR> <BR>For those who still have a shadow of doubt, feel free to
    contact the folks at Macromedia to inquire about the new Fontographer MX for 2006.
    <BR> <BR>Warmly, <BR>Stuart :D

    publically, I can reveal that there&#39;s invisible ink in my first post that

    Good job, Stuart.

    The new Macromedia had commissioned Landor to do a corporate ID and they&#39;d
    designed a logo with a circular munching yellow M, and a freeware TT t-face named,
    , , I forgot but remember that Jim wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d got his $ worth,
    as was usual with him. I&#39;d been working on venus for nothing else, and Neville
    was hiding out at my house trying to tweek 100&#39;s of images into his second
    book. Jim called looking for advice on the landor thing, and wanted to know how
    he could get neville from london to texas which I turned into Jim coming to my
    house. I also rounded up Matthew Carter and Alvin Eisenman to review the Landor
    work, so by the time Jim left, Landor was unhired, Venus was Vonnes, 54 styles
    of tweeked Venus and Neville was doing the ID. He took Vonnes and designed all
    the packaging a couple of times, and MM took them &#40;after I finished kerning

  body: David, do publish the &#39;Venusian spectrum&#39; - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s
    great. I did a multiple master of Venus a few years ago, but I can&#39;t find
    the files anywhere. If I recall correctly, I did not do enough redesign to allow
    the master to extend over a really wide range of weights - either a good thing
    or a bad thing, depending on your point of view.

    up the box from a Freehand MX box. I could have spent longer trying to get all
    the details worked out but I figured it was convincing enough to create a &#39;shadow
    of doubt&#39; . . . <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if you were in San Francisco for
    Typecon to listen to Ed Benguat&#39;s SoTA award acceptance speech, but it is
    reflected in this thread. Ed had a great bit about how it&#39;s impossible for
    a type enthusiast/designer to read a newspaper and proceeded to pantomime how
    a quick glance at a folded newspaper turns into pulling it closer, closer, taking
    off the glasses, closer again till your nose is almost touching the thing . .
    . It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true and I expect nothing less from my peers

    <BR>Regarding menus Jay I had the opportunity to work on a menu once and it can
    be an organizational nightmare. The biggest challenge being restaurants change
    menu items so quickly to keep &#39;ahead&#39; of the competiton and keep the regulars
    interested . . . <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also convinced menus serve as more of a branding
    piece than for function at some places . . . Counterpoint to that, I&#39;ve said
    it before, I&#39;ll say it again, there is an entire industry in Chinese menus
    which I am repulsed and strangely attracted to simultaniously . . . Also, they
    are among the easiest to read considering the array of options . . . <BR> <BR>:D
