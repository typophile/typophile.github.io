  alt=""> <BR><a href="http://www.salon.com" target="_blank">Salon</a> features an
  article on <b><a href="http://www.salon.com/business/wire/2003/11/12/ted/index.html"
  target="_blank">Ted</a></b>, United&#39;s discount carrier. <BR> <BR>My initial
  reaction to this is with a jaded sense of skepticism toward a big, bankrupt airline
  -- even though I&#39;ve had a good experience with United in my various travels
  with them. So, in trying to think past that and think about the branding issue at
  hand, here are my initial thoughts: <BR> <BR><b>The strategy is ripe because nobody
  likes the airline industry</b> <BR>- The airline industry is full of unfeeling behemoths
  that fundamentally don&#39;t <i>get</i> customer service. Travelers are at the service
  and mercy of the airlines, when it should be the other way &#39;round. <BR> <BR>-
  A new airline has the opportunity to be more human, more approachable, and perhaps
  more irreverent in breaking through the bad stereotypes. <BR> <BR>- A new no-frills
  airline has to avoid seeming &#39;cheap&#39; and by extension unsafe. Think ValueJet.
  You may remember ValueJet as the East coast carrier that, as a cost-cutting measure,
  put passengers at risk by shipping hazardous materials &#40;strike one&#41;. Then,
  with a crash and ensuing passenger deaths &#40;strike two&#41; they&#39;re not around
  anymore. <BR> <BR>- Finally, we can&#39;t expect JetBlue and Southwest to be the
  only players in the no-frills market forever. <BR> <BR> <BR><b>The execution is
  a missed opportunity</b> <BR>If United wanted to copy the golden formula for JetBlue
  and Southwest, they missed a key ingredient. One of the key ingredients for JetBlue
  and Southwest is the low cost. But the reason people buy into flying Southwest and
  JetBlue is one part price and one part attitude. SW and JB have poked a proverbial
  stick in the eye of the airline industry. They&#39;ve axed the class seating system
  &#40;now all customers get the same good service&#41; and they&#39;ve dumped the
  chicken or beef mentality. <BR> <BR>Ted is too close to United to effectively be
  sold as an independent. Instead of benefitting from peoples&#39; frustration with
  the big airlines, Ted is in danger of just being a little, obnoxious version of
  same. <BR> <BR>Think about this a second. With a no-frills version of United, should
  we expect the new cheaper flights <i>and</i> the same old planes? Should we expect
  limited destinations <i>and</i> the same crappy food? Do we get to have the first-come
  seating arrangement <i>and</i> that signature grumpy, &#34;and you are&#34; attitude
  from the &#39;service&#39; staff? No thanks. <BR> <BR>They should have distanced
  themselves from the baggage of the airline industry as a whole and from United specifically.
  Southwest and JetBlue have done this successfully. Their ads are witty but they&#39;re
  careful not to  over-promise. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t readily fit the airline
  industry mold that they can credibly call themselves independent. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  sure Ted wanted the best of both worlds. They want the appeal of a first-name basis
  and the independence that comes with being a little informal. Yet they hang on to
  the safety of not straying too far. With the name Ted and the big U mark on the
  tail, they&#39;ve tried to infuse the airline with United&#39;s credibility, safety
  and on-time record. Instead, they&#39;re in danger of having strung United&#39;s
  dirty laundry from the tail. <BR> <BR>_____ <BR><b>Disclaimer:</b> I know this is
  early to judge a new brand. Especially when all we&#39;ve seen is a press release
  and the airplane livery. We&#39;ll know the full story when we fly Ted or deal with
  their site or watch their ads.'

    of a certain overnight shipper, was &#34;They left off the Ex in TedEx!&#34;

    The [mountain range &#43; aeroplane &#43; exclamation mark] conflation seems a
