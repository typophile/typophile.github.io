  markets, who are notorious for their copyright infringement & piracy practices.
  I wonder how I could build some kind of license protection in the font beyond the
  licence information, which can be easily edited. It should protect the font from
  working on more than one computer."

    concious hinting errors, kerning all over the place, glyphs in the wrong slot
    &c -- the works! Just make it believeable enough for geezers who'd never license
    it anyway.

    don\u2019t. They sell the fonts to western designers who have to apply existing
    brand standards to Russian campaigns and products. The demand for popular classics
    like Helvetica is so high that firms in New York and London will buy enough Helvetica
    Cyrillic to make up the development cost."

    that have no interest in the lives, rights, or property of their own citizens
    have even less interest in protecting the intellectual property of foreigners."

  body: "I agree that IP law is irrelevant in some countries. In other countries,
    it's lopsided. And it's definitely inconsistent. \r\n\r\nThat said, it's still
    a legal concept in terms of protection. So any protection is going to have to
    involve legalities be it pre-job (carefully written contracts/payments up front,
    etc...as suggested) or post-job (suing, which is probably not a viable option
    from a cost/benefit POV). "

  body: "Trust me, I know those sites where people share fonts. Those designers who
    are not shared widely, or not at all, work either with very exclusive clients
    only (TEFF.nl, Unger, for example), or are hardly known and generally do not sell
    a lot. Those who are shared, normally are already established, or are in the best-selling-lists
    of vendors anyhow. \r\n\r\nI like Frode's suggestion."

  body: "I only see the situation improving once an affordable alternative to font
    piracy becomes available to people in the poorer parts of the world. \r\n\r\nSadly,
    I don't really see that happening any time soon, since most of the free/open source
    font development going on at the moment is either being done by Western hobbyists
    (who don't have the knowledge or interest to create fonts that target non-Latin
    alphabets) or being bankrolled by Google (who mainly want an easy-to-use library
    of fonts available for use on expensive tablets and smartphones and thus are also
    uninterested in fonts for the languages of poor countries)\r\n\r\nAlso, I suspect
    that part of the problem is that the big players like the Mono-borg and Adobe
    \"look the other way\" when it comes to the piracy of their products in poor countries
    because they'd rather that people get hooked on their products while poor than
    that they start to develop local alternatives..."

    a $35 Android tablet: http://technorati.com/technology/gadgets/article/will-indias-35-akash-tablet-survive/\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I think your point is valid. The disparities in the global economy don't
    really accomodate virtual products well. "
