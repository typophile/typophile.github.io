  of glyphs within a font's em box as you do to the proportions of letterforms themselves,
  and to the spacing among letterforms in the font as a whole? Or, on the other hand,
  are size and position within the em box a more practical matter, based on how you
  know fonts will behave in typesetting applications?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time."

  body: "Hey Tim,\r\n\r\nThis was discussed a little while ago here: http://typophile.com/node/78036\r\n\r\nThe
    short answer is that it depends: on the designer's preferences, on the intended
    usage, etc. As you probably know that the more em the characters take up, the
    bigger the font will seem.\r\n\r\nThe general rule of thumb is something that
    you might expect: try to keep as much as you can in the em. \r\n\r\nIt also seems
    like a part of your question asks about spacing, or arranging the glyph horizontally
    in the em, and of course this takes up even more time than drawing the letters
    themselves when one is making a typeface."

  body: "Thanks Colin! I was sure the collective answer would be that it depends,
    and the thread you reference definitely speaks to the practical aspects of making
    these size/positioning decisions.\r\n\r\nBut I'm still curious about the aesthetic
    effects of making this decision with such pragmatism. Perhaps rightly so, it leaves
    balancing text blocks to the typographer ... but type designers have such astute
    sensitivity to letter and inter-letter proportions, I wonder if the em box factors
    into the (at least vertical) aesthetics of their work."

  body: "Oh I also should add that going outside of the em typically doesn't have
    as big of consequences as it used to. Where as with older programs, if accents
    or ascenders went outside of the box, they would get chopped off, but more often
    than not modern programs\u2014including web browsers\u2014will display the entire
    glyph, inside and outside the em. \r\n\r\nThere are also other OT values you can
    set to give the font default line spacing, more info about that can be found in
    a useful PDF Karsten Luecke made and uploaded to his website: http://kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.shtml"

  body: "The em definitely does. In my last design I went through a whole bunch of
    proportion changes before settling on one that I liked\u2014one that seemed full
    enough at text sizes without looking too large. \r\n\r\nThe proportion that you
    have inside the em effects default line spacing, how \"big\" your text is when
    set at a text size, and the OT values I reference in the second post also enable
    some control over the default values. The designer also can't go too small in
    the em or their typeface would look minuscule next to other fonts at the same
    size and require some adjustment on the behalf of the typographer. \r\n\r\nSo
    like many things in typeface design it is a balancing act, trying to provide your
    user with the best defaults but knowing some of them will be changed in the type
    setting anyway."

  body: I don't really worry about the body of my letters. I got into type design
    late enough that most issues related to going outside the box were resolved and
    people had figured out that it's generally not good to have a caps height bigger
    than 700 em on a 1000 unit body. I also don't use any glyphs with stacked accents
    or design scripts with large flourishes. So for me it's a non-issue as long as
    I keep things under the 700 em height limit other designers established.

  body: "Thank you both.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the em box is an unnecessary abstraction.
    If typesetting applications allowed designers to specify font-size based on baseline-to-cap-height
    dimension, for instance, or other dimensions of the letterforms themselves, wouldn't
    that make more sense?\r\n\r\nOr is there something I'm not thinking of, and there's
    a reason the em box is valuable?"

    the notion of baseline to cap height doesn't apply. Think of most of the Indian

  body: "With OpenType fonts there's a technical limitation I have to deal with. The
    maximum vertical size is 1200. The difference between the height of the Aring
    and the depth of the ogonek (or comma accent or descender) have to squeeze into
    1200. I usually rescale the whole font to fit exaclty into 1200 after testing
    the accents. After scaling, my caps height usually ends up in the 700 range anyway.
    This way I can design accents that look good to me rather than trying to hit a
    specific target height.\r\n\r\nVietnamese accents require more planning to squeeze
    in without making the font look too small."

    bounding box (highest element to lowest element across the whole font). Where
    did you get that from, Ray? I was just looking at my own Hypatia Sans, and the
    vertical BBOX is ~ 1360 total in the black weight....\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I also
    second Jason's comment. The em square is needed because there is no design element
    that is comparable across all writing systems.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT "

  body: "I'm guessing that Ray might be referring to the quasi-standard employed by
    some foundries that aims for the sum of OS/2 TypeAscender, TypoDescender and TypoLinegap
    distances to equal 120% of the UPM value -- hence 1200 units on a 1000 unit em
    --, and to the technical limitation that the sum of the Typo distances should
    equal the sum of the Win metrics distances to ensure cross-platform and cross-application
    compatible default linespacing. Taken together, this approach produces a default
    linespacing that is equivalent to 10-on-12 point leading, but require that all
    outlines fit within the resulting Win metrics to avoid clipping.\r\n\r\nBut neither
    of these are solid technical requirements or limitations, and there are good reasons
    to break both of them so long as one know what one is about."

  body: "Ray, clipping is generally determined on Windows by the OS/2 table WinAscent
    and WinDescent values: so long as those values afre equal to or greater than the
    bounding box, there should be no clipping. Over the years, we've had to make some
    fonts like Cambria Math with very large WinAscent and WinDescent values to avoid
    clipping of the tallest glyps.\r\n\r\nOne thing to watch out for though is that
    a lot of apps also use WinAscent and WinDescent to determine default linespacing
    as well as the non-clipping zone, so if these values are high you will also get
    loose linespacing in some apps.\r\n\r\nMS Word does sometimes clip shorter than
    the WinAscent and WinDescent values if particularly tight linespacing is applied
    by the user. This is because of the way in which Word draws lines of text.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure how Apple determine clipping."
