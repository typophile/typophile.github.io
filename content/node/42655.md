body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI've recently been asked by the local student arm of the
  Green party to make them a poster. Although it's too late to make any changes for
  the actual event (already gone to print), I'm interested to get some feedback because
  it was something of a new adventure into an almost Constructivist style.\r\n\r\nI
  would love some criticism.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "Hello, i think that theres a hierarchy problem going on it there, to do this
    kind of layouts, you must organize them in the most bizare but legible way, i
    believe that there is a problem with lettering beeing too close to the edjes of
    the pages, this is something that confuses the eye, the numerous types of font
    weights make the eye follow a balance line, getting to confusing with them, you
    make the viewer to lose his mind and just stop trying to read the poster, also,
    i have been writting this for about 2 minutes and i have already forgotten the
    message, the only thing i remember is GREEN, that is because green had something
    different on its shape (leaf) , i dont know but i would say, take it easy with
    the typefaces, use max 2 weihts or correctly justify the use of more through your
    design.\r\n\r\nandreas"

  body: "Rafe \u2014  I like this, though the El Lissitzky style really cries out
    for a bar of crimson red somewhere in the design. Without that it looks a bit
    anaemic. But I like the angled type and I think it's well balanced."

  body: "Thanks for your comments; I would like to put some colour in there, I will
    try that out (the poster had to be black and white on this occassion though).
    And yeah, I used four different weights; perhaps I overdid it a bit there, though
    I think the type up to the edges is part of what gives it its dynamism.\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate all of your feedback!\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: Of course a slab of very rich green would provide a counterpoint to Lissitzky's/Malevitch's
    usual red.
