    comes from Europe. I don't see how anyone is shocked. I can't speak for these
    guys tho. Thats a funny lil' costume. Besides, who wants to hear about fairies
    and pixies some more?\r\n\r\nEven better, the album is called the Arockalypse"

    serif version of them. I agree with Eric. Best metal comes from Europe by Linotype.
