  body: "I think this is my first ID (if I'm right). Hooray! \r\n\r\nAs penance for
    gloating, I'll add a bit more. Another upright italic-feeling typeface is <a href=http://www.pampatype.com/html/tipografia_caracteres_rayuela_reg_home.html>Rayuela</a>
    by Alejandro Lo Celso. Rayuela is actually supposed to be used for lenghty texts,
    especially Spanish language ones. I'm sure there are other upright italic-esque
    typefaces, but I haven't found them. In case anyone's interested."

  body: My pleasure. Is that specimen book Tankard's <em> TypeBookOne</em>? Because
    I was thinking about buying it for myself. Is it worth the cash?

  body: i think you're getting a wrong idea. he has no interest in typography whatsoever,
    thats why he gave me the booklet :)

    That's why I'm on Typophile!
