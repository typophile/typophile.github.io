  most unusual characters seem to be the very star-like asterisk, and the 'i', I believe
  it is upper-case, despite looking lower-case, as the whole rest of the book is upper-case
  too."

  body: "I have often commented about how easy it is to make personal fonts with samples
    of hand lettering, just by filling in a template. I would expect the cartoonist
    could easily have made a custom font of his own printing. I did use one of the
    online font tools with part of this sample to search for this, and did not turn
    up a match. The odds are good that this is not available because it is custom.\r\n\r\n-
