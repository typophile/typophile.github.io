  idea was to do the English in roman text and the french in italic, the problem is
  that the text has a lot of italics in it, that is fine with the english but how
  do you show the italics in french(since the text will be all italic)?\r\ndo you
  just change it back to roman?\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\n"

    with bilingual English/French documents in Canada and no one would contemplate
    setting one language (always the implicitly <em>inferior</em> language) in bold,
    italic, or another typeface.\r\n\r\nA bilingual document must communicate the
    equality of both languages typographically. Abandon your plan, please, and typeset
    both languages in roman by default."

  body: "I agree with Joe Clark: don't treat one language as \"secondary\" or inferior
    to the other. You can use position to separate the English and French texts, without
    any change of typeface.\r\n\r\nBut in general, the question of using italics for
    text, and then dealing with \"italics\" within that text, comes up again and again.
    There's no ideal solution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, if you're going to set any lengthy
    text in italic, make sure that you're using a type family whose italic was *designed*
    for extended reading. An italic derived from the chancery italic handwriting (and
    fonts) of the 15th and early 16th centuries is usually much better for this than
    one derived from the more rounded italics of the 18th and 19th centuries, which
    were usually meant only as companions to the roman. That lets out Times Italic,
    for instance: we're all used to seeing it, so it's familiar, but it's really not
    designed for continuous reading. (In fact, I think that all by itself, Times Italic
    is responsible for a good deal of the prejudice against *ever* using italic for
    text.) \r\n\r\nThe usual practice for dealing with titles or emphasized words
    within an already-italic text is to set them in roman. That's logical, and expected;
    but it has always bothered me, because it's almost always ugly. When the \"italic\"
    words are sparse, and the typeface has the requisite characters, I sometimes use
    small caps for emphasis or titles within the italic passage. (All small caps,
    not caps & small caps.) Of course, if capitalization within those words is important,
    then this won't work. But in an old-style typeface, it can look quite elegant,
    and easy to read.\r\n"

    italic. [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/nara/|Nara,]] for example.\r\n\r\n\u201CNara
    includes two different secondary scripts for situations where you need to emphasise
    a selection of text that is already italicised. The designer of Nara also explored
    the notions of what defines a secondary script. While the Cursive version is perfectly
    upright with a stroke structure inspired by handwriting, Italic uses a 12 degree
    slant.\u201D"

    italics of the 18th Century were based on contemporary secretarial hands, just
    as the italic hands of the 15th and 16th century were, and both were used extensively
    -- in both written and typographical form -- for extended text. Bodoni, for example,
    set the entire introduction to his <em>Manuale Tipographico</em> in italics.\r\n\r\nI
    think there is a good argument to be made -- and a testable one -- that the 18th
    Century neo-classical and romantic italics may be easier to read in extended text
    because a) they are more regular than many of the renaissance italics, having
    consistent slant angle and consistent stroke contrast patterns, b) the stroke
    contrast typically follows the slant angle, rather than being independent of it,
    c) letters are typically less cramped than in the more compressed renaissance
    italics and closer in proportion to roman types."

    agree, i decided to do it italic just because the original text was written in

    them both roman. "

  body: "The novel <em>Birdy</em> by the pseudonymous William Wharton, published in
    1978 by Knopf, had a similar problem. The story was told by two different narrators,
    usually speaking in alternating chapters. \r\nThe book's designer (whose name,
    alas, I do not know), solved the problem by using W.A. Dwiggins' Electra font,
    designed for Linotype in the 1930s. Dwiggins' original design included a Roman
    and an Italic, but his Italic was an oblique Roman, generally considered easier
    to read in mass than the more conventional cursive italic. It was Dwiggins' original
    oblique Roman type that was used for the second narrator in <em>Birdy</em>.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    No. 1: In the 1930s, Linotype's customers found Dwiggins' oblique Roman a little
    too avant-garde, so Linotype sent Dwiggins back to the drawing board to create
    a cursive version of Electra, and that's pretty much the only Electra Italic you
    see these days. Check around, though, I'll bet someone has made a digital version
    of the original Electra Italic. \r\n\r\nP.S. No. 2: <em>Birdy</em> became a bestseller
    and was published as a mass-market paperback, set in another Dwiggins face, the
    then-ubiquitous Caledonia. Caledonia has a cursive Italic, and the Italic chapters
    in the mass-market paperback <em>Birdy</em> are damn near impossible to read."

  body: "If text blocks are flagged by typeface as language-specific, this indicates
    a shortcoming of the layout.\r\nIdeally, the reader should be able to determine
    the conventions of the document design immediately, established on the first page,
    have this confirmed at the first page turn, and then be able to anticipate where
    his/her eye should go on subsequent page turns, without having to look for cues
    such as typeface, or having to start reading text to determine which language
    it is.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nHowever, as to your point about the French being a translation,
    there is a case to be made for identifying the secondary status of translation.
    For instance, in a book of poems by Lorca (Penguin), the verse is set in standard
    manner, in Spanish, and the English translation is in footnotes, prose style.
    This respects the primacy of the original language, and the limits of translation.\r\n\r\nSomewhat
    related, in a recently acquired album (Ozawa/TSO, late 1960s), I was intrigued
    to find that the English and French liner notes were written independently, with
    different information and critical perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    18th century the connection between type and handwriting had gotten much looser
    than in the 16th. And as far as I know, italic type in the 18th century was mainly
    used as a secondary face, to complement the roman; not intended for use in long
    passages of text. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to try to test your hypothesis
    that 18th-century italics are easier to read than chancery italics. Maybe it's
    just my eye, but to me, every factor that you name in favor of the later style
    is one that makes it less readable.\r\n\r\n"
