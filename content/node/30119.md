  at the university. Its a total 4 weeks course including the research, surveys, problem
  finding and the final product. As a final product we have to redesign the complete
  package according to the problems we figured out in the existing packaging.\r\n\r\nI've
  taken the cigarette packaging for my research. Ive tried few concepts for the boxes
  but am planning to give a typographic treatment to the cigarette boxes and to the
  cigarettes. Generally they have very rich classic look but i wanted to try a bit
  different.\r\n\r\nNow the question is - Will it be a good idea to explore typography
  on cigarette packaging? Will it affect the buyer? Please tell me what you all think
  about this idea.\r\n\r\nSmoking typophiles can tell me what they would like to have
  on their cig-box, may be i can try that as well :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the time,\r\nSatya_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    also because\r\nI find that type of smoking more related to tasting, \"a moment
    to enjoy.\"\r\nI used to like \"<a href=\"http://www.iisg.nl/collections/reclamearsenaal/e14-615.php\"><em>The
    Rising Hope</em></a>\" (this slogan also, still used) but I cannot find it in
    Turkey, I can find <a href=\"https://www.lilbrown.com/prodpics/SAMSONT.jpg\">Samson</a>,
    tho. Last year a student of mine brought me some tobacco from the far East of
    Turkey, in a white bag, it was very blond but I could not keep it well and it
    got rotten.\r\nBeside issues related to healt, I think you could reveal <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~ina/images/infographics/smoking_big.jpg\"><em>smoking</em></a>
    as you can reveal the difference between producing/drinking beer and producing/drinking
    wine."

  body: "\"NIL\" from Germany and Danish \"King's\" or \"King's favourites\" are both
    quite stylish, I think. King's were originally designed by Claus Achton Friis,
    one of the great Danish designers/ typographers.\r\n(see image below, from Steen
    Ejler: Claus Achton Friis \u2014 Skrift og brugsgrafik, Arkitektens forlag , Copenhagen
    1996) \r\nThe picture shows the design from the 50's but they pretty much look
    the same nowadays, despite a redesign which added some new background colors for
    the different versions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1020176_6361.png]\r\n\r\nI
    also remember reading an article arguing that \"the smoking problem\" (no quote)
    could be helped by designing ugly packaging i.e. with clashing colors, misprints,
    overprints and hard-to read type that would make it difficult to differentiate
    the brands and to make cigarettes look less like a lifestyle product."

    body: "In the late 60s, I went to a small \"great books\" liberal arts school
      west of Chicago, called Shimer College. A wonderful place. One of the English
      professors there had worked in advertising and then subsequently was living
      out his dream of being a college professor, wearing a tweed jacket with suede
      elbow patches, smoking a pipe, and driving an antique Jaguar SS100. As he told
      the story, Marlboro had originally been positioned as a \"ladies' cigarette.\"
      Not a big seller. They then did a complete about face and turned it into the
      cowboy thing, and Andy was one of the first models to pose in the photographs.
      He was very glad of this, since the income from all his connections with the
      creative enabled him to leave the agency and go into teaching. He also was quick
      to point out how manipulative the whole thing was, and that it had everything
      to do with image and association, and almost nothing to do with the cigarette
      itself. Might the agency have been Burnett? Too long ago, can't remember. (And
      maybe this is covered in Patty's book.)\r\n\r\nMy two puffs worth,\r\n\r\nBruce"
