  Grotesk CE Roman in their identity but when I want to upload it on the web it says
  that it's not allowed, does anyone have a recommendation on a similar one that I
  can use online? Also looking for a bold version :)\r\n\r\nHere's an example: http://upshizzle.com/pfiles/12366/Akzidenz.jpg\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n"

    two fonts I've linked to come with web licenses and in the necessary formats,
