body: I'm developing a logo for an apparel company and I'm having trouble deciding
  between these two approaches. The first option speaks more to the market, but I
  don't think it reads quite as well. The second option reads much better, but feels
  a little bland to me. Thoughts?

  body: "I don't know what the market is, but the first option, with its sigmas in
    place of the e's says \"oh, oh, fake-Greek is cool! and we can think of anything
    else to say\u2026\"\r\n\r\nI don't think that legibility of readability would
    be the issue here. It will be read just fine (even though it isn't written in
    either English or Greek).\r\n\r\nAre you looking for something that is all style
    and no substance? Maybee there is another visual pun that you can use that would
    be more deep.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: Yah, I agree. The sigmas look quite awkward.. being that there are no other
    visual elements in the logo, the first thing we are forced to look at are those
    sigmas!
