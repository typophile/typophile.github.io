  session and $50 for each half-day session, plus materials fees if any\"\r\n\r\nMaybe
  I am blind but I cannot seem to find information about them on the typecon site.
  Does anyone have a link to these workshops? I even signed up for the newsletter
  and not received any information about them. (is it just too early for a schedule?)"

    rest of the masses that wish to pounce and are anxiously waiting with baited breath
    for the detailed listing of speakers and workshops.
