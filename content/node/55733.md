body: "I'm wrapping up a retro baseline script <a href=\"http://typophile.com/battle28\">that
  started as a type battle entry</a>. I want the high/low joins to happen automatically.
  At first I put them in calt because, well, they are contextual alts o+r -> o+r.high
  (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/52410\">see here</a>). However some major apps
  (Illustrator CS2) don't have calt on by default, but most do have liga on. I have
  seen many examples in the wild of nicely designed scripts ruined by ignorance about
  calt. \r\n\r\nWould it be a problem to do this kind of sub inside liga? The result
  is very ligature-esque and I can't imagine a time when you'd want ligs on, but this
  off, or visa versa.\r\n\r\nAnything I'm overlooking? Thx!"

    now. at least that's the conventional wisdom on such things.\r\n\r\nmy opinion
    is that if you're going to be making OpenType fonts, you must be an OT evangelist
    yourself, insofar that you educate your user base how to use your the OT features
    of your fonts effectively."

  body: No matter which feature you choose, there is no guarantee that the end user
    will set it nicely. They can turn on calt or not. They can just as easily keep
    ligatures on while attempting to track it out. Since your script is connected
    using ligatures seems like a reasonable way to go. You could even use the clig
    feature, though its probably not necessary in your case.

  body: "As liga is used as a default in more applications, I'd say use that.\r\nI
    put contextual alternates in a \"Pro\" script font, thinking it would be default,
    but lo and behold, a distributor managed to produce an advertisement for the font
    with the contextuality turned off, i.e. non-pro. "

    in a later version (CS4 I think, but it might have been CS3).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
