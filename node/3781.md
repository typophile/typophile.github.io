body: Here is a layout &#40;printers spread, back cover then front cover, from left
  to right&#41;. <BR> <BR>Rather a new approach &#40;design wise&#41; for me. <BR>The
  black/gray is my simulating what 100 black and rich black would look like. Gray
  being 100k and rich being the darker. Its 4/4 Inside covers are ad space. <BR> <BR>Thoughts?

  body: Nice work. I&#39;m a sucker for black/rich black, but last time I did it on
    a CD booklet, the printing was done on germany without my &#34;supervision&#34;
    and they used a papper that simply ate the 2 blacks as one <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0>. What is the rich black you&#39;ll be using on this? <BR>
    <BR>The only feeling I have is that the box for the type could be moved a bit
    to the right... At least I&#39;m tempted to move it a bit. <BR> <BR>Will you put
    a plastic matte on this book cover?

  body: The rich black will be printed 50 40 30 100, the other just 100 K. I had contemplated
    coating, spoecificly matte uv, buti think this will dimenish the rich black effect.
    So I am printing on a super smooth coated matte stock. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant. <BR>

  body: My thoughts, which are not what you want to hear &#40;but you did post the
    pdf&#41; are that you could work a bit more on this challenging your design decisions,
    such as the box -- for example -- that disrupts the flow of the lines and adds
    an unnecessary element. Why not a box without the lines -- lines without a box?
    Is a box necessary? Flush right type? Why? I see only blue and black, why this
    color combo? Personally, I think typography alone could carry the day for you.
    Of course it would have to be just the right face, impeccably set. Hope this helps.

  body: The biggest problem you might face is in the registration. Even if the registration
    misses by one dot you will have a colored glow. Yeah, maybe only slight, but that
    is why I would use a pantone black and then a gloss varnish on top &#40;or of
    some sort&#41;. If then the reg is off with this it won&#39;t glare near as much.
    <BR> <BR>The opposing lines/angles is jarring, but this is not necessarily a bad
    thing for some people.

  body: Can you tell us more about the client? I live in the Phoenix area, but I&#39;m
    not familiar with the Scottsdale Dream Center.  <BR> <BR>To me, the name suggests
    a place where one would go to find practitioners of holistic medicine/alternate
    spirituality. If that&#39;s what this is, then I think the design is far too hard
    edged.

  body: I like Tiffany&#39;s Idea about the varnish but try this use two varnishes
    both tinted put white in the matt varnish and black in the gloss varnish. I did
    this technique years ago for The Dime Savings Bank. It works.

  body: 'Kyle wouldn&#39;t that put your image of the man on the back cover? I have
    an idea you might look into: take the man image with no face blow it up huge and
    put your title where his facial features would normally be. It could be surreal,
    like the work of De Chirico.'

    shown. <BR>I like the idea of the face bigger. Does this mean that you think this
    may be amore appropriate direction for the piece? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: 'I don&#39;t care for the man. &#40;Maybe I&#39;m too concerned with politcal
    correctness, but the idea of using an image of a white male with a briefcase seems
    a bit dated.&#41;  I think that my gut response would have been slightly different
    if  the businessman was less illustrative, perhaps just a silhouette. It might
    be striking to have the solid black form of the businessman against a black-on-rich
    black striped background. '

  body: 'Kyle I like the idea of a surreal faceless man/woman, but not the whole body,
    but this is just my opinion. One take on Tiffany&#39;s idea is make the silhouette
    aqueas coating and then hit the background with a mat white varnish. The effect
    is the silhouette is glossy on matte. So basicly you could make it a PMS match,
    Aqueas Coating and a Matte Tinted Varnish and you have another slot for a 4th
    color. '

    if you browned the red up a bit? More redrock looking?  ---  Also, I&#39;m not

  body: Yes, CMYK only. I was hoping to make this bright, and punchy -- thats where
    that red plays in. That, and its 100 M 100 Y, so it prints quite well, as if it
    were a solid PMS color.
