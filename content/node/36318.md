body: "OK, this can't be that difficult...\r\n\r\nIt looks like a simple san-serif,
  but for some reason, I am having a DICKENS of a time trying to ID it EXACTLY. So
  many fonts (like Avenir) come close...but I am looking for something with the same
  perfect roundness and symmetry in the O's and the lower e's. Even the counters within
  the p's and d's look like circles, and aren't off-center, elongated, or squashed.
  The descenders and ascenders aren't super tall, either.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help??[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SP_A0052_5024.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SP_A0037_5191.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, everybody...I think if it isn't Avenir, it is darn close. To get
    it exactly the same, however, I think I will need to modify it. \r\n\r\n"
