  fonts. I like the design of his Kalenderblatt Grotesk and wonder where it came from.
  The original font is most likely German Jugendstil from about 1910. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KalenderblattBySteffmann_3995.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/kalenderblatt-grote.font\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Many thanks Fivos for finding the Jackaman and Harvey fonts, and for the
    information that the digital fonts are based on the Players typeface designed
    by by Adrian Williams in the 1970s.\r\nAfter checking the three fonts I find that
    both Steve Jackaman and Thomas E. Harvey created generally similar but independent
    digitizations of the players typeface. The Steffmann version, when sizes are adjusted
    to enable comparison, and allowing for accumulated  conversion errors, is a point
    for point digital match with Thomas E. Harvey's font, although some tinkering
    was done. \r\nI see that Nick Curtis digitized, as Stoney Island NF,  a 1930s
    design by Alf Becker named Chicago Modern Thick and Thin. \r\nThe Players typeface
    looks somewhat similar to Becker's design.\r\nDon"

  body: The Fontry claims that <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry/arb-44-chicago-modern/'
    target='_blank'>their version</a> of Alf Becker's Chicago Modern Thick and Thin
    is the most accurate. I've always liked this original version more than the Players
    typeface it inspired - perhaps because it was a hand drawn alphabet I see as masterful
    artwork.
