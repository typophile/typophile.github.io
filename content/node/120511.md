  body: If I recall correctly, some monospaced typefaces lighten the |m| by shortening
    the central stem.

  body: Are monospaced typefaces supposed to be absolutely consistent in line weight?
    I think I always assumed you can compensate for dark areas like these. The /m
    is invariably going to be problematic in a monospaced font, isn't it?

  body: "<blockquote><p>I always assumed you can compensate for dark areas like these</p></blockquote>\r\nYes,
    of course, but given the modularity and adherence to a very small grid of this
    design, I think it could be right to look for solutions used in pixel and similarly
    strictly constructed typefaces."

  body: "That makes sense. I can see the solution for /m, but for the other characters
    I don't think such a solution would work. M/N/W/AE/OE/&/@/\xD8 are particularly
    too dark. For OE I would simply increase the counter a bit. For \xD8 perhaps the
    slash within the counter should be lighter than outside it. I would prefer to
    remove the slash from the counter completely, but given the point size at which
    the typeface seems optimal, I don't think the slash will be obvious enough if
    you remove the part within the counter.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite impossible to fix
    all the dark spots using a pixel-based solution. But I guess since the design
    is inspired by pixel typefaces, it may not be necessary to remove all dark spots."

  body: "Thanks everyone for your valuable feedback!\r\nI guess another trick to lighten
    the \"m\" could be to widen the grid slightly for that character, making the glyph
    a little wider, but keeping the character spacing? I was thinking about making
    this into an old school CAD font in the .shx format. In that case I would not
    be able to vary line thickness for individual characters or strokes."

  body: If you widen all letters enough, indeed the dark spots should mostly disappear,
    but I think you will have to wide the characters too much to remove the dark spots
    completely. If you widen the characters just a little, characters like /m will
    still look relatively too dark even though on an individual basis you've lightened
    the /m. It's worth a try though. Your characters are quite condensed, so you do
    have some space to work with.
