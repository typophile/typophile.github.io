  \r\n\r\nI made something a booklet with Dala Floda as Headline Font. Now the same
  booklet will be translated to Russian and I desperately need a cyrillic font, similar
  to the Dala Floda. Any lovely suggestions?\r\n\r\nThis is the Dala Floda:\r\nhttp://typedesk.com/2010/12/09/dala-floda-by-paul-barnes/\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much for your help!"

    and weight(s) you used.\r\nYour best bet is to find a fancy cyrillic headline
    font that goes well with the body text one."

  body: i know it's very very difficult and I don't know anything at all about cyrillic
    fonts. :-( I used Dala Floda in Bold and Roman. Maybe anyone has got an idea what
    fancy cyrillic headline font might be a good choice?

  body: The text font is Verlag light in the international version. In the cyrillic
    they need to change the text font as well of course. I didn't research one yet.
    I think I'll do that after I found a solution for the title font. I am really
    worried about the very big titles in Dala Floda bold an roman cause they are very
    important to the look.
