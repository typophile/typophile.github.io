  body: "Congrats and good luck Nick!\r\nIs that two different small capitals features
    shown (smallcaps & c2sc), or does the font recognize when the feature is applied
    to all-caps strings and convert them differently?"

    are four features that effect small caps:\r\n- aalt changes lower and upper case
    to small caps\r\n- smcp changes lower case only to small caps\r\n- c2sc changes
    upper case only to small caps\r\n- ss03 changes numerals to small cap numerals\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the same horizontal positioning as the caron, circumflex and dieresis. Should
    be fine. Maybe the image doesn't help?"

    artifact. With the PDF file I see diacritics above E are consistent (maybe a bit
    towards left, but this is my taste and not a problem). Again, a very nice release."

  body: Thanks, Igor. The accent placement over an /E/ was a struggle between visually
    centering it over the top arm and centering it on the centre of gravity of the
    /E/ which is further to the left (which is where I've gone with Camphor). Believe
    me, I spent a long time deciding!

    My preference is just a personal taste. I also liked very much the nut fractions
    and ordinals.

    of Verdana, which is a good thing, off coarse. A workhorse with class. Not your
    last release I hope?

    support, with the inclusion of superior capitals, both superior and numerator/superscript
    figure alignment, nut fractions and f-thorn ligatures (!).\r\n\r\nSorry, but I
    don't get the flag-waving.\r\nIn this day and age, geared to an international
    market, this doesn't strike me as being particularly English, especially with
    its European single-bowl \"g\" and Univers-style ampersand."

    curious about the fl ligs: the pdf shows they are all connected except the versions

  body: Good spot, Ben. I only noticed the /fl.alt/ and /ffl.alt/ not being joined
    up when you mentioned it. (They are still two/three separate characters in the
    pdf!?) The capture of the character set above shows how it actually looks.

  body: "Not all versions of Univers appear to have the 'Et' ampersand. I'm assuming
    the original version had it but then the digitised version seems to have replaced
    it? Now in Linotype Univers (1999), guess what, it's back! That might be a somewhat
    simplistic way of looking at the history of the Univers ampersand, so someone
    in the know might like to flesh it out a little.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Camphor's
    ampersand does not have the ascender on the 't' part of the the Et (it's more
    of a small caps T). Not altogther sure what influenced me on the Camphor ampersand.
    If it was Univers, it was pretty subliminal. Fairly sure I just went for a horizontally
    flipped 3 as a starting point and went on from there."

    BT or Trebuchet MS, you can see it there. If not, Universalis ADF does have it.

  body: "My understanding (completely subjective, as I've not done any statistical
    analysis) is that the Anglo* ampersand is a single stroke \"eight-ish\" shape,
    whereas the Continental model involves at least one extra stroke, and is more
    discernibly \"E + t\".\r\n\r\nI name-checked Univers, recalling that there had
    been some objection to its Et form of ampersand in the Anglosphere, with the substitution
    of the more normal, for there, shape in later editions of the typeface. \r\n\r\n*Also
    preferred in the former colonies.\r\n\r\n"
