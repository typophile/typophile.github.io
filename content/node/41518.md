  for this typeface, and i need to use them on a mac for now, so i converted them
  to otf using transtype pro. The only problem is that when I install the font, it
  shows up in my fontbook as, having 4 medium faces, and 4 medium italics even though
  when i click on each one they are all different, they should be named,  ligatures,
  roman, fractions, and small caps.\r\n\r\nsince they are all named medium, and medium
  italics, i can only use the first one named medium and the first one named medium
  italics, in any program i use.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know how i can rename each of
  these files for fontbook so that i can use each face? "

  body: "Do you have a license that permits this sort of conversion? Except for Adobe's,
    few retail font licenses do. Or is it a shareware or freeware font?\r\n\r\nSounds
    like TransType Pro didn't do as good a job as one might like. Assuming it is legal
    to do so, you should first try to redo the conversion in TransType Pro, modifying
    the menu names along the way. If TransType doesn't allow the degree of fiddling
    you need, you might have to go to FontLab Studio or some other higher-end program.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Well, if it's a typical retail font, you need a license to use the font at
    all. When you say \"I was given a .pfb and .pfm\" that sounds rather like somebody
    just supplied you with the font for the task. In many cases that wouldn't be legal,
    any more than them supplying you with a copy of Photoshop to do a project would
    be legal, unless they specifically bought a license for you.\r\n\r\nBut then again
    there are shareware and freeware fonts, and it's possible that whoever gave you
    the font had a license that permitted it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
