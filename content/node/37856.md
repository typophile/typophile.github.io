  via CSS tags/attributes. I believe this recommendation was \"pulled\" a few years
  ago, and it would be terrific if a similar and/or replacement feature were being
  considered.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to original <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html\">recommendation
  on W3</a>.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for additional information."
