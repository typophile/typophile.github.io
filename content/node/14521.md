    Uppercase area, you see a screen that indicates that there are no posts there.
    \ After seeing this post of yours, I looked for your thread there and found it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Actually, the Tracker works pretty strangely in that respect: as far as I
    can figure it does show you the threads you've made a post in, but sorted based
    on the most recent post to it by <strong>anybody</strong>, not by you. Meaning:
    you could have made a post to a thread a month ago, but it goes to the top of
    your own tracker when somebody else makes a post to that thread. So it's only
    practically useful for backtracking in the very recent past, like half a day or
    something.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"...you can also track your recent posts.\"\r\nTiff,\r\nThere is no problem
    with threads I have already posted to or even threads where the title is self
    evident.  The problem is best illustrated by looking at Kyle's recent post called,
    \"RGR Results Guaranteed Realty\".  From that name, I thought it was one of the
    \"what typeface is this\" kind of posts which are very popular with most people
    but not interesting to me. Therefore, I did not look at it until Kyle posted this
    thread we are on now.  When you go to \"Uppercase\" area, the screen says zero
    posts and zero comments.  This kind of made me feel that there were zero posts
    and zero comments in that area.  Imagine my surprise when I clicked on the Uppercase
    critique area (after Kyle told me it was there) and seeing his post. What I am
    saying is, thatb if I already know about it, it is not a probem and that \"zero
    posts\" is less than accurate.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Chris, ok, I understand. I've been asking Christian if we can't replace 'forum
    topic' with the actual name of the forum from which it originates. That would
    be better, right?

  body: also, the areas that seem to have zero action because all of the action is
    one hierarchical level beneath is a rather large hurdle for the guys.

    know your reward is only in heaven:-).\r\nAlso, since there are so few posts in
    the Uppercase area, we could just make it one section simply called \"Uppercase\"
    without any subdivisions.  Then it would show up in the Forums list.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
