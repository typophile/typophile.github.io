  of a commercial? I'm looking for a typeface that appears to be that of Miss Brooks,
  however I want to see if their is a commercial font available.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/miss-brooks.font"

  body: "Yes, its similar but not quiet what I'm after. The example I have looks more
    looks Miss Brooks to the \"T\".. but if I download the font, it displays all choppy.
    That leads me to believe its a poor knock-off off another font.\r\n\r\nDiva appears
    to be the one that has been knocked off. Though diva is a little thinker than
    the example I have. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/diva/"

  body: I should also add that the original "Manuscript" by Bauer and later revivals
    are listed in Mike Yanega's <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListMN.html">script
    guide</a> which includes Nick Curtis' Bayern Handschrift NF.

  body: "Just a word about Miss Brooks. It is NOT a knockoff of anything. It was one
    of <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/denada/dn1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Mike
    Allard's</a> shareware creations. All of his fonts were revivals of old typefaces.
    He did this in the very early days of font digitization, though, and the quality
    is, indeed, poor.\r\n\r\nAlso, he originally created these fonts on a Mac and
    not only refused to make PC versions, but forbade anyone else from doing so. Of
    course, like many things with computers and online, that was not controllable.
    As a result, most of his fonts that you find today are old, unauthorized PC conversions
    - and that may also account for part of the lack of quality.\r\n\r\nIf you decide
    to purchase one of the other versions, Joshua, I might mention that Mary Monroe
    was made by David Rakowski. He was a putting out fonts (including lots of shareware)
    at the same time as Mike Allard and he's had nothing to do with fonts for many
    years. So Mary Monroe may very well be as crude as Miss Brooks. Also, Petzendorfer
    shows that Manuscript had two M's. It appears that none of these versions has
    both (it's especially strange that Rebecca Alaccari didn't include the alternate
    in one of the Diva fonts) - so that might be a factor in which font you opt for."
