  advertising and is called 'game creative'.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the logo represents
  the essential building blocks of all games i.e. pixels. So I'm looking for a face
  that has a pixel look or is very square and gridlike.\r\n\r\nI tried ff stealth
  and gridnik but neither seem right for this. Can anyone suggest anything else?\r\n\r\nThanks"
