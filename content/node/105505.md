body: "I am thinking of using 1 Cor 13:13 (\"And now abide faith, hope, love, these
  three; but the greatest of these is love.\") in the original Greek for an engraving
  on wedding rings. Here is an initial attempt:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/motto1_6374.png]\r\nMy
  questions are:\r\n- The font is GFS Neohellenic. It seems to me that a serif font
  would be less legible at such a tiny size as a wedding ring requires. Do you have
  any other suggestions?\r\n- Apparently, there is no kerning in GFS Neohellenic.
  I think I should add negative kerning for the |\u0393\u0391|, |\u0391\u03A5|, and
  |\u039F\u03A5| pairs. How big should the kerning be? Are any other pairs jarring?\r\n-
  Is the word spacing in the first line not too loose?\r\n- Is the leading good?\r\n-
  Is there anything else that could be improved?\r\nThanks!"
