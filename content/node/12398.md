  body: "Just disappeared from their site. There was a thread about this somewhere.
    Finding it is another story. \r\n\r\nedit: Found the ID thread I was talking about:
    <strong><a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/9841> here </a></strong>\r\n\r\nEric
    Mentions the removal in this <strong><a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/8695>thread</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>A
    few of my typefaces were made for very specific projects (Process Grotesque +
    Elderkin) and really have no contribution to make beyond that. Sure they look
    fine, but who cares? I'm not thrilled with them and plan on removing them this
    spring.</cite>\r\n\r\nI always feel a bit sad when a designer removes fonts from
    a body of his work regardless of how they feel about them now.\r\n"

    so give me some time and I'll try to find that specific thread. Search isn't working
    yet, so...

    New Foundry: Process Type\r\n\r\nWitness the (alternately organic and digital)
    beauty of Eric Olson\u2019s Process Type. Featured are the first four families:
    an old-school grot with exagerrated quirks, a surprisingly usable product of ASCII
    art, an exploration of the same industrial roundness found in Frere-Jones\u2019
    Garage Gothic, and a thoughtful take on Courier. The site itself is notable, glowing
    of attention to usability.\r\n\r\nUpdate, April 15\r\n Process Grotesque and Elderkin
    have vanished from the Process Type website but the fonts are still available
    for sale at MyFonts.\r\n"
