  contemporary, modern, industrial when applied to a sans serif typography sense.\r\n\r\nI
  see fonts listed as contemporary and I think clean eligible fonts like Gills Sans,
  Helvetica, Arial (fonts that you see everyday and that are main stream), but I also
  see other futuristic / modernistic looking fonts that also list themselves as contempary.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any good links, tutorials or books that I might be able to read to help
  me understand the finer points of these meanings as I try to improve my knowledge
  of type.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great\r\n\r\n"

  body: Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style" is an excellent typographic
    resource. Unfortunately, as you're probably discovering, there is no concrete
    set of rules to typographic definitions or their usage. People seem to use what
    makes sense to them. So its best to carefully explain to others what you mean
    when you use certain terms that could have various meanings or even usages that
    vary by context.

  body: "\"Contemporary\" is a word often used to indicate a style, but taking it
    literally it means \"at the same time as\" (and here, an ending \"us\" is implied).
    So it seems odd to me to talk about types designed half a century or more ago
    as contemporary. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Agree with bemerx25, you'll find some descriptions to be erroneous in some
    places. There is a tendency to equate contemporary and modern which is inaccurate
    and big differences between similar descriptions. Futuristic and futurist would
    be an example of this.\r\n\r\nI think Helvetica is classified as a neo-grotesque
    sans to be really specific about it, but I understand this doesn't really deal
    with the 'theme' of the type so to speak, rather it's form.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    ago. That leaves Helvetica as contemporary to someone born in 1954, as I was."

  body: "Thanks bemerx25 I'll be sure to take a look. \r\n\r\nYou guys you don't know
    of any other books that also cover how to describe a certain style from a more
    design point of view? I'm trying to get a better grasp on it all."
