<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I, as most mexicans have family working in the United States, so I decided to make this post as a mean to support them asking all north american typophiles to reject and help to stop the HR 4437 bill.
There are about 41 million hispanic inmigrants working in the united states, doing an honest life trough hard work on duties most north americans are not willing to do. It's true many of them (about 11 million) reached the United States ilegally, but it is also true that ilegal workers are hired under very unfair conditions like up to 14 or 16 hour working days, not medical or social assitence, unjustified dismissal and very low payments.
Trying to turn this people into criminals is not fair, and is not going to fix the problem, it´s just going to make it worse. A wall in the desert is not going to stop illegal inmigration and treating people like animals (denying medial assitance) is the real crime. There are also some illegal north americans in mexico (many of them in San Miguel de Allende, about 40 km from here), and I can assure you they are well treated.
The real solution is to have a fair treat for temporal inmigrant workers, because we all know you need the workers and we need the work, this radical position is an hipocresy that only benefits the ones who explode and violate the human rights of workers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll second that and add that unless you are 100% Native American you are no doubt the descendent of immigrants who may or may not have come here legally. It makes me crazy the entitlement that so many Americans seem to feel over what is truly an accident of birth. I am so profoundly unimpressed by my countrymen at this point that I welcome some new blood!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Héctor,
My family came here from Greece in early 20th century. We are a nation of immigrants who all came here for a chance to live a better life. In the process, we made this country what it is today (for better or worse). Each new generation of immigrants has something new to offer and should be welcomed as much as all that came before. I welcome your family and any other to become part of us.

If that was the case Chris, wouldn't the law have been been more firmly enforced?
The theory is that a large underground workforce enables US businesses to compete with cheap labour in China etc., so the situation is allowed to continue.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree, with Nick. We've sent some very mixed messages to people entering this country illegally. That said, one of the things that makes the US great is that, for the most part, we obey the law. Personally, I welcome people who want to come here to adopt our laws and customs, and pay taxes. I also feel that its important for people who live and work here to vote, so I'm not sure I like the 'guest worker' idea.
We also might want to think about why so many people want to leave Mexico. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It's similar to the debate about adoption - prospective adoptive parents are put thru the ringer for children they really want (and can provide for) and yet any idiot can bear a child or two or three and end up being a drain on our resources.
The harsh anti-immigration bills will threaten parents who have children who were born here and are therefore American citizens, and also a lot of law abiding tax payers.
I ain't saying there shouldn't be limits and regulations but that they should be humane and reasonable.

<div class=commentbody>Nick, one of the reasons the U.S. government has not cracked down on illegal immigration is that they will lose voters by taking up that issue. Most of the jobs supposedly performed by illegals are service industries, not manufacturing, so they aren't in direct competition with China. This isn't about immigration, this is about illegal immigration. We are a nation of immigrants, and anyone is welcome in America as long as they are here legally, obey the laws, pay taxes, etc. Businesses that hire illegals should be fined. Workers deserve a fair wage, and while illegals may be making more money here, they still aren't being paid a decent wage by American standards.</div>

Governments are different than people. Because one government has a policy which we may not approve of, does not allow us to apply that same logic to our own. I don't speak for my government and it rarely speaks for me. The U.S. is far from the only country with failings and it isn't even the worse of the lot. That does not give us license to say, "Oh, well, we are still doing better than Rwanda, so what we do is OK until we do worse than the others."

<div class=commentbody>True enough but aren't these new laws designed to keep out a certain type of immigrant? Read: not white, or not white enough.
If laws were designed in order to make it easier to obtain legal immigration and then pay taxes, vote, etc instead of creating criminals out of hard working citizens we'd all be better off.</div>

Which is where much of the support is rooted. The Democratic party sees it as a way to garner votes and are milking it for all it's worth.
So many who don't live near the border don't know that many Mexican women sneak across the border to have babies here, so they can have the benefits. When people are coming, not to be assimilated, but to simply milk the system, this is a big difference from the immigration issues of previous generations.</div>

Don't get me started. How many corrupt or dictatorial governments has the US propped up or helped install because it served our "national interest"? And then we try to export our "values" abroad through force instead of example - and wonder why we're pissing everybody off.
How can ANYBODY justify Guantanamo by any standard?</div>

<div class=commentbody>All nations have the right to set and protect their own borders, and to regulate who comes in.
However, the United States of America is also the same nation that once agreed that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
What is morally untenable, to me is not that people come to the US to seek a better life (illegally, if necessary), but rather that so many Americans seem to be willing to look the other way while individuals living in their midst are mistreated and paid substandard wages.
We talk about all the individuals being here illegally. How come more people don't talk about the individuals, companies, and corporations who pay these immigrants illegally-low wages? That is criminal behavior! <strong>That</strong> should be stopped. In fact, if these crimes would be stopped, the illegal immigration issue might flare-down a bit as well. But no one seems interested in that dialogue. We want to have it both ways as Americans… cheap goods and services, and only legal immigration.
People come to the US because they know that they will have a better life. Illegal immigrants know that millions of Americans are willing to pay them under the table.
As a caveat, it should also be pointed out that the US allows more legal immigrants across its borders than any other nation in the world. But then again, even these people are not treated well. I live as a foreign national in another country, and my situation clearly cannot be compared with that of those who have come from Central America to the US, but I have had a few hurdles of my own to jump through here in Germany. Nevertheless, I feel ashamed when I hear what problems my government back home puts *legal* immigrants through. In comparison with that, my problems are nothing. Since September 11, it seems as if all immigrants to the US are viewed as potential terrorists, people who would rather tear the country down rather than build it up, in order that they get to have a better life, too. Maybe it would be for the best if we as Americans would totally rethink how we thought about immigration altogether so that we can finally be honest with ourselves again.
Just my opinion.</div>

Because they have nothing better to offer they flounder around looking ridiculous.

Reality, I think we can agree on that, but it is also where the problem lurks.
Idealism can work great in design, so I shouldn't be surprised that typophile would be dominated by liberals. Even I wish I could live in La-la-landia where there were no borders, everyone was as concerned for my welfare as I am (and visa-versa) and there were no people who want to blow me up because I am an infidel, and all things really <cite>are</cite> equal for everyone.

I really think that a temporal worker program would be a fine solution, it makes legal and easier to control and regulate something that is already happening in a very chaotic and unfair way and that will not be stopped with a wall and a threat.
It would also make clear for the people that goes to work there that they must return to their homes after certain time.

I don't like the idea of a Guest Worker program. I'm in favor of real immigration. Allow more people in, and let them become citizens if they want to. I'm afraid that Guest Workers will be seen as second-class residents. That's not fair.
Decades ago, European nations created Guest Worker programs. The workers came, but they were not guests. They stayed, had children, and now their children have had children. But too many of these residents are still treated like they don't belong, even though many of them are just as German, Dutch, or French as the German, Dutch, or French themselves… not culturally, but before the eyes of the law. </div>

That's the spirit. I guess I didn't think that one through. If it existed, it would be where San Fransico's bounderies are, and I can't afford to live there. But if it were on the ballot to change their name to La-la-landia, I would be their biggest supporter.

Ok, to clarify: One problem is many don't have an interest in making it work. They don't know or care what the people here think, or they wouldn't violate our laws. In general, they are the uneducated class, and are here to take advantage of our system, which they don't have in Mexico. Read the end of my post below for more details on this.</div>

That is a very simplistic point of view. Can one really make generalizations about a group of people 11 million large? Think about how many countries don't even have 11 million people living inside them… 11 million is too big a number for blanket statements like that.</div>

I guess one big problem I have with the whole thing is do we ever draw a line? Is the American taxpayer expected to be Mexico's welfare system, with no limit? As a rule we don't get the cream of the crop sneaking across the border. There are parts of OC where you can see all these little Mexican baby machines cranking them out as fast as they possibly can. (partly because of the Catholic beliefs on birth-control, I imagine), while all their brood is orbiting them as they cross at the intersections
Meanwhile I can't seem to get ahead here, even though I am making what some people think is decent money. We can't afford to buy a house, let alone provide for retirement at my current income levels.
If there is no limit to letting the poor of Mexico flood into California, then no amount of taxation will ever be enough.
If the bleeding-hearts are so concerned about the poor Mexicans crossing our border looking for opportunity, they should be ultra-concerned about the Guatemalans, who are even worse off, who are raped, have their money stolen, usually by soldiers or police. Since they have no right to be there, no one cares how they are treated.
<a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MEXICO_MISTREATING_MIGRANTS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2006-04-18-18-08-31" target=_blank>Check this AP news story</a>
Vincente Fox's hypocrisy reaches new levels of irony.
Please keep in mind I am married to a Mexican citizen who feels much the same way I do, only she is more cynical about the Mexican government. And I love much of the Mexican culture and music. I probably have the biggest collection of trios, rondallas, and female ranchera singers of any white person in California. Lucha Villa, Chelo (Mejor Me Voy, Si Ya Te Vas: Si algun dia las penas de la vida te hacen daño, no pretendas buscarme, etc.), Lola Beltran, Flor Silvestre, Beatriz Adriana (echele ganas) etc. are the part of my music collection I would grab if the house were burning down. Too much effort went into getting them all, and many are out of print.
So I can say I love Mexicans, I don't don't think I should be taken advantage of by the ones who don't respect our laws.
<cite> There are also some illegal north americans in mexico (many of them in San Miguel de Allende, about 40 km from here), and I can assure you they are well treated.</cite>
From my experience, it would only be because they have money. I have family in Mexico, I have traveled in Mexico, and I know how it works. Please don't paint a picture as if ghetto occupants started sneaking into Mexico and down to San Miguel de Allende, they would be welcome with open arms. I have been in San Miguel. I bought some nice Huichol art there, fortunately before the price started skyrocketing.
The city is very pretty. And I imagine they want to keep it that way.
And another thing, why in the flying blankety-blank shouldn't we be able to decide our own laws, or enforce the ones we have without extortion from people with no right to be here. The whole thing is ludicrous.
Now to balance my position, I am in favor (as I think is a majority of Americans) of a program that legally allows workers to be here. There is no doubt they make a valuable contribution.
But not without restrictions or guidelines.
And now a story we personally know about. A Mexican women (cousin of a friend of my wife) crossed the border illegally, then started having babies here (now she is at four), so now all the kids are US citizens, and she is getting benefits; Money for a place to stay (using forged Social Security docs) and since the fourth son is deaf, she is given money for special education, and hearing aids. She doesn't work, because if she did she wouldn't be elegible for all the benefits.
And I could go on for quite a while about things like this, because of the work my wife does. She is trusted by many of them to hear the details of all the stories the working ones have concerning their relatives.
All courtesy of the unknowing Californian taxpayers.
And Ricardo, you make a valid point about my wording which I have amended above.
<cite>Ah, that’s a bit too close to Seattle. Sorry, my offer is off the table. ;-)</cite>
Hey, I have asked to be transferred to develop that area for my company. I'll look you up if it happens. From the conversations I overheard at Starbucks in Enumclaw, you guys could use a few more people there whose political viewpoints aren't in the clouds.

I'm not surprised to see you're in Orange County, I have relatives there and know what the politics are like. Luckily California is a big state.
>In general, they are the uneducated class, and are here to take advantage of our system
Our country is in the sorry state it's in because our OWN citizens are uneducated, xenophobic and only interested in protecting their own interests, not to mention taking advantage of the system.
For the record I'm a Democrat not because my parents are (altho I'm proud that they are and raised me in the bluest district of the bluest city in the country) but because they are right now the party of morality and values. Invading another country for oil (and lying about why) and giving tax breaks to the rich, not to mention devastating the environment and trying to govern this country with a Christian form of Shariah (can't they see the hypocrisy!) does not strike me as moral, or frankly, Christian at all. And as a Jew I find the sancimonious false piety of the religious right both alienating and terrifying.
Thank god for Jon Stewart.</div>

Same here. But among the Christians I know are some of the staunchest supporters of Israel that I know of. And now it is becoming clear we share a common enemy that wants to wipe us from existance.
Granted the right you speak of probably wants to wipe them from the earth also. This is why it is increasingly clear that the world needs a benevolent dictator who is omnipotent, and can put the sanctimonius pious bastards of both sides in their place, so the creative types can work and live in a world without bloodshed and pain.
Amen.
But for a while it doesn't look good, sorry to say. And don't get me wrong, I'd probably agree with you on several key issues, like Iraq being a quagmire whose repercussions could well be far-reaching, and only compounding the terrorist dimlemna. Oh well, any sane solution to anything will be thrown out because it offends Jesse Jackson and the ACLU, or the pious religious right. I think it is a Murphy's Law corrolary.</div>

Is there a statute of limitations on this one? How far back do you want to go? Because I'm pretty ticked off about the invaders from the land bridge who wiped out the woolly mammoths. No respect for the ecosystem! And the way they just took over the entire continent was just rude. I mean, have some respect. Suddenly it's <em>their</em> continent? Sheesh.

<div class=commentbody>I consider myself pro-immigration. It is one of the things that makes this country great. That said, I fervently support LEGAL immigration. Allowing illegal immigration hurts those that follow the proper channels.
My wife is Azeri and immigrated here on a fiance visa last year to marry me. The process of the fiance visa and adjusting her status after we married to allow her to stay took about a year. Additionally, we had to wait two years for her 212(e) residency restriction to expire prior to the fiance visa process. I speak from personal experience when I say that the legal process of immigration takes time and can be filled with anxiety. BUT the process exists for a reason and should be respected. My wife and I were treated with the utmost respect throughout the process by USCIS officials and in the end we were rewarded for following proper procedures.
The issue of illegal immigration touches my wife and I personally as we followed the rules and waited over two years to be married and together. To reward illegal immigration in many ways punishes those of that follow the rules. I am in favor of more open immigration policies, but at the same time I believe that whatever immigration policies/laws are in place should be enforced.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The issue here is specifically the politics regarding
illegal immigration not the general meaning of immigration.
The bottom line is, we need to have some type of control system.
My parents immigrated to this country in the 1970s not by dodging
border patrols, but through the established legal process.
I'm concerned w/ the illegal immigrants who come and try to abuse
the loopholes of our laws and "milk" it as much as they can.
As was pointed out, even if most illegal immigrants who come to this
country are living and working an honest life, are they paying
taxes? How are they contributing to the welfare of our nation?
Furthermore, does our nation have the economic resources to sustain
an ever expanding illegal immigration population?
Even if we support the mental determination of illegal immigrants
to carve out a better life, it is simply unrealistic in the long
run to remain stagnant in our border policies.
Does that sound too unreasonable or right wing?
I'm a Democrat btw.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The problem with the proposed new law is that it does not discriminate between hard working tax paying "illegals" and those abusing the system. It criminalizes all of them. If it were easier for dedicated hard-working would-be immigrants to gain legal - even if temporary - worker status then it might free up resources to deal with those who really shouldn't be here. And I reiterate that these new laws seem particularly aimed at certain groups.
My personal pet peeve is foreigners living here who complain about America. I complain very loudly about our government but as an American who votes I feel I have that right. But when my (mostly European) friends start grousing my response is "don't let the door hit you on the way out". If Europe's so bloody great, why'd they leave?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Patty, That certainly makes sense. I think most people would agree with that. So, this bill should be shelved as too flawed, or is there a way to amend it, I wonder?
<cite>Dennis, I think it’s kinda interesting you’d choose to live in SF where you’d be surrounded by -horrors!</cite>
I guess that all got miscommunicated. Basically I was saying *if* there was a place that should be called La-lalandia, it would be SF. I love SF. There is few things that compare to the fog rolling into Golden Gate Park, or the percussionists just inside Stanyon on a pretty summer day (do they still do that?), but my memories are all from the late '60s. But even from then I could tell some stories that would make everyone here cringe a little. I came out of there having gone from naive to not trusting anyone. It took a long time to get over that, but probably served me well until I was ready to settle down.</div>

<div class=commentbody>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_4437
From what I've read, it's an attempt to do something..
It seems like this situation may be too complex for 1 bill to solve.
An excerpt:
"Detractors say the bill includes measures that will infringe on the human rights of asylum seekers by stripping important due process protections, criminalizing status over which they may have no control, and dramatically limiting their access to essential services. It would also redefine undocumented illegal immigrants as felons, and punish anyone guilty of providing them assistance. It also would create several new mandatory minimum penalties for a variety of offenses, including some that would expose humanitarian workers, public schoolteachers, church workers, and others whose only object is to provide relief and aid to five-year mandatory minimum prison sentences.
On the opposite side of the issue it is argued that living illegally in the United States is a crime, and that this bill merely aims at recementing US immigration codes that have for so long been neglected. Supporters of the bill argue that it will increase border security by providing more US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to the border, thereby helping to curtail any possible entry to the country by terrorists, and that the passage of this bill may help curtail drug trafficking and human trafficking from Mexico to the US by depriving smugglers of sources and contacts on the US side of the border."</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's just so extreme. Plus immigration in general got so much more difficult after 9/11, I have several friends (hardworking, tax paying, etc) in limbo.
Whatever the laws are, there will always be people trying to break them, take advantage, etc.
There has to be a more humane and reasonable (and enforcable) solution than this law.

<div class=commentbody>The truth is that if even the actual US legislation could be enforced to full accomplishment both sides would suffer severely: the US would loose more than 11 million of cheap, efficient and very hard to replace employees and latin american countries would loose more than 11 million jobs (mainly Mexico).
A law that recognizes the need of both countries of this laboral relationship is the healthiest way to go, giving the US the control and security they need, and México the humanitarian guarantees their workers deserve.
Altough many inmigrants look for the US citizenship, the fact is that more than a half of the work inmigrants return to their countries after some years, so it's not neccesary to make a citizen of every inmigrant worker, just respect their rights and play clean with them.

<div class=commentbody>This is one of those issues on which so many of us feel compelled to have an opinion, but which very, very few of us really grasps at all. I mean, I can sit here in Ohio and watch the marches, and then listen to Lou Dobbs, and then read some posts here, and maybe I'll have an opinion. And maybe my opinion will roll around and re-shape itself over and over, as I reflect on the fact that my own great-grandparents were immigrants, but they came through Ellis Island, and their whole life situation was really not like that of the southwest-border immigrants at all.
On top of that, I don't think much of the political "debate" we see is about much of anything susbtantial. We have a kind of sprawling and fairly active border patrol, as far as I can tell, but people come streaming in anyway. They'll get themselves woven into American society if they want to, and these bits and pieces of legislation won't end up meaning much. We're not gonna close our borders in any significant way, and we're not gonna open them up much either. We're just gonna keep muddling along. We can pontificate about the supposed obnoxiousness of people marching with Mexican (not American!) flags, or we can pontificate about the ways in which immigrant labor (illegals or not) is an essential part of our economy, so "illegal" must be considered in context. It just doesn't matter.
My own "opinion" is that a lot of this brouhaha is election-season politics, nothing more. And another opinion would be that we in America just need to acknowledge we can't have it both ways: free trade worldwide, but limited circulation of human beings. Globalization is just gonna happen, like it or not. These are perhaps some of the growing pains, but it's mostly just a whole lot of nothing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The only thing I have to say to those who are against illegal immigrants is this:
Did the Pilgrims came to America legally? For a country built by illegal immigrants, you certainly are neglecting your roots.
And for those who claim immigrants should learn English because the English speakers were here first, then I have another question:
In that case, shouldn't the official languages should be various Native American ones and not any European ones.</div>

While we're at it, let's turn back the clock on all the ways we can kill each other...oh, I guess we can't. Seems this line of thinking isn't productive at all, unless we are just looking to maximize guilt. But since some people have enough of that to go around, I guess we're good to go.

<div class=commentbody>I do think immigrants should learn English not because it's my way or the highway, but because English is the official language in use in this country right now and in order to advance your interests in American society, culture, and economics you need to learn it. Period. For your own good, not because the Brits were here first.
I'd do the same if I moved to another country.</div>

Exactly!
I have to say though, I'd hate to have to learn English. What a mess of rules and exceptions for usage and pronunciation. We take it for granted, but if you ever try and teach it to foreigners, you quickly become apologetic.
If you add in that many of the people we are talking about can hardly read or write in their own language, it becomes more difficult.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You say you'd do the same if you moved to another country. That makes sense. And yes, it does make sense for someone living in the US to learn English. But in areas where Hispanophones are paying large parts of the tax bill, it isn't fair <cite>not</cite> to be bilingual. America isn't like other countries. It isn't the motherland that Italy, China, or most Old World countries are. And, unlike other American countries, it has never become one. You can be American, but most Americans are something else as well, be it Italian, German, Dutch, Chinese, or whatever.
Anyway, it's about time North Americans start learning more than one language. It seems to me that most of the negative feelings towards these people come from simple ignorance. Most Americans don't speak their language or understand their culture. If you remove yourself a bit and think of the reality, what would it change to allow these immigrants into the US legally and accept Spanish as a de facto official language alongside English in the places they live? It would mean more taxpayers. Besides that, not much would change. I don't understand what everyone's problem is..
<cite>If you add in that many of the people we are talking about can hardly read or write in their own language, it becomes more difficult.</cite>
Don't get so self-righteous. My grandparents from Italy weren't well-educated. It takes my grandmother 15 minutes to write a birthday card and I don't think she's ever read a book besides maybe from a small Missal from when she was a girl that she has by her bed. She finished grade 6 (which means she was more educated than most people her age from my region) and my grandfather only finished grade 4. Meanwhile, they are better off, no, <cite>much</cite> better off than most native-born Canadians. Why? They worked their asses off and saved every penny, like all immigrants. Immigrants tend to be more driven, ambitious, and successful than most people. Just think: they saw a problem and went to such great lengths to overcome it as moving to a foreign country, learning a new language (or several), finding a place to live and a job all over again, etc...
Would you have the wherewithal to do something like that? I don't mean moving to a new country because you can afford to do something new (my grandparents had to raise and sell a runt pig their neighbor gave them to afford the ticket to come here), but overcoming your conditions to do it. Acknowledge that in business, there are many entrepreneurs who never had much schooling but who had an idea that made them very rich.
Next, acknowedge that the rich pay more taxes. </div>

Don't get so judgemental. I know *many* of these people. Some have lived here for many years and can barely speak a sentence you would understand.
Granted, someone who is driven by self-motivation can do practically anything. I'd say your grand-parents were motivated, and I notice you say they did learn the language. I'll bet it is because they wanted to, which made up for their lack of education. When you want to do something, it is all the difference in the world.
But looking up a word to see the meaning, can be a big help. I know because I have traveled through many parts of Mexico, speaking their language. And my dictionary was never further away than my pocket.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I couldn't agree more that Americans should learn more than one language and was lucky enough myself to go to a school that started language ed pretty young. Hence I'm fluent in French and also basically functional in Spanish and Italian. But unfortunately not enough emphasis is placed on language ed in most schools here, especially spanish.
However there are so many different immigrant groups, thru history & all over the country, that bilingual education isn't that practical - besides it further marginalizes immigrants not to speak English. I understand it isn't easy for a 65 year old immigrant to learn a new language, but kids in school can and should if they want to get anywhere. Again, I'm not being rah rah rah USA here but practical. English is the lingua franca here (and a LOT of places) and is likely to remain so. </div>

Give me your tired, your poor and earning to be free... Bye Gdubya.. nob... So I left the USA to be FREE!!!!! UK let's Euro citizens, all Commonweath countries (Canada, Australia, NZ, etc) Irish, to vote in local elections.
USA you can't go to Cuba because the US is stuck in the past... you can't do nothing right...But where the president,

Your belly's too big
And I love you,

And of opportunity
In a just and a truthful way
But where the president,

And until that day
You’ve got nothing to say to me
To help me believe
In America, It brought you the hamburger
Well America you know where,
You can shove your hamburger
And don't you wonder
Why in Estonia they say
Hey you, Big fat pig
You fat pig, You fat pig
Steely Blue eyes with no love in them, Scan The World, And a humourless smile
With no warmth within Greets the world
And I, I have got nothing
To offer you
No-no-no-no-no
Just this heart deep and true, Which you say you don't need
See with your eyes, Touch with your hands, please
Hear through your ears, Know in your soul, please
For haven't you me with you now?

<div class=commentbody>If the US would just get it over with and Annex the Globe then there would only be state and territory borders and hopefully we could all just go where we please. Wouldn't that be grand? Of course we would have to deal with a wee bit of global war etc. but we are already well on our way in getting that started. Nevermind my sarcastic ramblings. I think that we should allow anyone who is willing to work, follow our laws, and pay taxes to come to the USA. It was immigrants that built our country to what it is today...
