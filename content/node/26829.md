  body: Aw gawd, you gotta be <i>kiddin&#39;</i> me. It&#39;s plain ole <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/minion/regular/testdrive.html?s=%26%20P%20L%20E&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Minion</a>!  <BR>Here I am, staring at all those Garamonds, and
    not one  <BR>ampersand matches, so in the end I start doing a systematic  <BR>run
    through the FontBook, and whaddayaknow? <i>Bingo.</i> <BR> <BR>I feel stupid.
    No, really... Not being able to recognize  <BR>Minion. I know it&#39;s very distorted
    and only 4 characters,  <BR>but still. D&#39;oh!
