  on the walls for their gallery descriptions. It looked distinct enough that I felt
  I should recognize it, but was unable to come up with a name. I have also been unable
  to find it in my rather limited collection.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to snap an example,
  but I'm hoping maybe someone out there is familiar enough with the museum to know.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "If this is the lettering you mean, it seems very close to Documenta Sans
    from the [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/|Dutch Type Library]]. Look at the numerals,
    especially the 8, and the italic letters. The only disconnect seems to be the
    W, which looked like the legs crossed fully in the Museum sample. For some reason,
    the idea of further customizing what is already a very expensive font, seem like
    gilding the lily, but there must be some money there I'd guess.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
    find a better match?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike, that label is exactly what I'm referring too\u2014I guess I
    didn't search hard enough on the museum website for an example to pull.\r\n\r\nIt
    was the lowercase 'w' and 't' that really caught my attention in the museum. In
    the regular Documenta Sans, neither seems to match, but the capital 'W' and the
    smallcaps 'w' do match the one from the museum. The lowercase 't' from the museum
    has a more aggressive upward flair to the tail. In fact, as I'm flipping back
    and forth between the label sample and the Documenta Sans sample I feel like the
    museum sample is slightly more angular and aggressive in general whereas Documenta
    carries more roundness\u2014I'm seeing this in the connections for the 'n', 'm',
    and 'r'. But then other forms like the '8', 'g', and italic 'f' seem to be spot
    on.\r\n\r\nI guess I was wrong that I felt like I should recognize the type, which
    is a relief then to my pride since I couldn't. Of course, now my curiosity is
    in full strength and I absolutely have to know what they use."

  body: "Jason, the longer I look at the sample and the font, I agree there are differences,
    but I can't come up with anything closer. I also looked closely at Haarlemmer
    Sans, also from DTL, which is quite similar in some respects, including the 't',
    which seems to match the sample better. However, Haarlemmer's italic is quite
    different. \r\n\r\nIt's a mystery so far, and I love these kinds of challenges.
    I have written to the Museum via their web site to see if someone would tell us
    what typeface they used for their labeling. I will let you know if I get a reply.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks guys, Scala Sans does look to be the one. And that would explain my
    feeling of familiarity. I had used it for a big project while on an internship,
    but being a good little boy didn't snag it for my own when heading back to school
    so it wasn't in my collection when I flipped through.\r\n\r\nI think I'll have
    to go purchase it so I can proliferate the application of quality Dutch type."

    Jonathan Krohn, and he confirmed that the font used was Scala Sans. I added this
    just to show that sometimes asking questions from the source does get a reply.\r\n\r\n
