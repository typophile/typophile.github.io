		<div class="commentbody">From Roger Black’s Blog:

—But in 2004, the Guardian decided to dramatically reduce the size of the paper to "Berliner" size, 47 x 32 cm, to better compete with The Times and the Independent, which had gone tabloid. Porter felt that more than size had to be changed, to help the paper deal with the competition—particularly from the web. The news executives in London felt the pressure of circulation and advertising declines that are affecting newspapers all over the world.

The Guardian had played the Internet game very well. Neville Brody designed a brilliant web site, Guardian Unlimited. Yet, that was not enough. Porter wanted a complete typographical change, to signal the paper's currency and relevance just as strongly as the Hillman design had done in the '80s.

He called in Paul Barnes, who'd been an adviser during the previous round of typeface changes, and Barnes hired Christian Schwartz. (Disclosure: I worked with each of these guys at the beginning of their careers.)

Clearly, Porter wanted to make the same break with the old design as David Hillman had with the Old Labor. The Hillman legacy he thought had again begun to take on the dank odor of an old Manchester basement. Papers everywhere had changed, catching up with the design, and the Guardian had to break out of the pack.

He started with Gerard Unger's Gulliver, which had raised newsroom eyebrows when it was adopted by Richard Curtis at USA Today in 2000.

In Lisbon, Barnes and Schartz described a gruelingly long-run type development process. The Airbus 380 probably has had fewer design iterations. The team marched away from Gulliver, back through some Aster-like Old Styles, then did quite a great number variations to something they called "Hacienda," only to abandon it all all in favor of an updated slab, that looks, uh, a bit like Gulliver. But, that's not all. They ran up some 50 different weights, and then made an sans serif set as well.

What an effort! What a client!

The design got off the ground a year ago on schedule, unlike the great Euro double-decker, and to much designer applause (one of those fat pencils from the D&AD and "world's best-designed newspaper" award from the SND).

Porter said the editor's, Alan Russbridger's brief for the redesign was for something "modern" and "austere." He got both. But did he get the Guardian?

Does it make sense to to abandon the traditional forms of newspapers as much as possible, so that, for one thing, the younger generation doesn't attach the stigma they do to the traditional papers? Does it make sense to get rid of a modern classic (Helvetica) and a sweet 19th century revival type (Miller) and bet the farm on a contemporary, Unger-wannabe?

Moreover, does it make sense to move so far away from a successful typographic design? (The layouts and spacing are still quite reminiscent of the Hillman style.) Do readers have any feelings about these things? I think they do.—

Ergo: custom job.</div>
