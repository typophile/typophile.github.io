  Chemistry for elementary - preparatory school's level are used locally in Arab countries.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  Dr. Lazrak and his team  (UCAM, Morocco) presented some interesting reviews for
  different used systems through the Arab World and, I think, they applied it to LaTex.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  with STIX fonts arriving to good maturity, I think it is time to work on this project
  and we, @ Aratypo, welcome any person who would like to share with us thoughts and
  efforts in order to realize this font.\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance.\r\n\r\nAbout
