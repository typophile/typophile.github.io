  body: "You know, I think we're only offering the closest fonts that resemble the
    lettering. The artist can distort the size and shape of the strokes, serifs and
    interior spaces (counters). Most likely, no digital font was used in the production
    of the Love logo. If it was designed before 1980 that is almost a certainty. I
    think a Clarendon was the typeface he started from.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The type in the design is heavy, but its stroke contrast is greater than
    that of either Clarendon Black or Century Schoolbook Bold.\r\n\r\nCentury Schoolbook
    Ultra is closer in stroke contrast, but then it's too heavy.\r\n\r\nAll that said,
    Clarendon is indeed closer in design. I agree with Mike that it was probably used
    as the starting point."

    has type at its core.

    back & Clarendon indeed came closest, but it's definitely not an exact match.
    If you look at the numbers Indiana used in his work, you'll clearly see the differences...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gallerybrown.com/indiana/indiana_numbers.jpg"
