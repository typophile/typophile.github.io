  evening 12 October 2013, the diner of the yearly ATypI (Association Typographique
  Internationale) conference took place at the atmospheric Winter Garden restaurant
  of Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky in Amsterdam. More than 300 attendees enjoyed the excellent
  buffet. Highlight of the evening was the presentation of the 3rd <em>Dr. Peter Karow
  Award for Font Technology & Digital Typography</em> to Dr. Donald E. Knuth, world
  famous for developing TeX and Metafont.\r\n\r\nEspecially for this occasion a booklet
  titled <em>Digital Typography & Arti\uFB01cial Intelligence</em> was jointly produced
  by Adobe and the Dutch Type Library, the latter being the initiator of the Dr. Peter
  Karow Award. In this publication font-software pioneer Dr. Peter Karow, who is especially
  renowned for developing the IKARUS program, describes how digital typography in\uFB02uenced
  type design and text layout. Digital typography has changed font production and
  text composition in their entirety. Modern text composition was mostly in\uFB02uenced
  by programs such as WordStar, Word, PageMaker, QuarkXPress, and FrameMaker, which
  replaced writing, typesetting and printing in both of\uFB01ce and at home.\r\n\r\nDr.
  Peter Karow (1940) studied high energy physics at the University of Hamburg, leading
  to a dissertation in 1971. With Dr. Gerhard Rubow and Dr. J\xFCrgen Weber he founded
  the company URW Software & Type GmbH in 1972. Several contacts with type designers,
  especially Hermann Zapf, had great impact on his development of the IKARUS program.
  Since 1988, Karow and Zapf worked together on the <em>hz</em>-program in order to
  use the power of computers to improve the micro-typography of texts. \r\n\r\nDr.
  Peter Karow gave international presentations at numerous conferences, wrote many
  articles for journals, got seven patents for DTP-related methods, and wrote several
  books, among them: <em>Digital Typefaces</em> and <em>Font Technology</em> (both
  Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1994), and <em>Typeface Statistics</em>
  (URW Verlag, Hamburg, 1993).\r\n\r\n<em>Digital Typography & Arti\uFB01cial Intelligence</em>
