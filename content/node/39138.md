  well for display but a little too irregular for copy.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    as Din. What's it for?

  body: "Thanks for the replies... planning to use Crank8 for a logotype and as a
    headline font for a non-profit. \r\n\r\nThe font I choose for copy would probably
    be used in print material only (brochures, flyers etc.). Legibility is a key concern.
    Was thinking of something like Excelsior or Garamond, but perhaps too traditional
    (needs to be forward thinking, \"innovative\" brand)."

    for something that should be more \"innovative\" I can't help but to think of
    my own typeface: [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Profile&site=d&btnG=Go|FF
    Profile]]. A sans serif text face that has it's roots in the renaissance but with
    a minimum of contrast. Maybe this could be a healthy contrast to the more geometric
    Crank8.\r\n\r\nMartin"
