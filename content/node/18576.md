  Tablet or the mouse? Is one more accurate than the other? If so, which one? Or are
  they both the same and really all up to preference? Thoughts anyone?\r\n\r\nMister

  body: "Tablets are generally used more by retouchers and the such who 'digitally
    paint'. Type design (if you're talking actual production) is purely manipulation
    of single points. I don't see how a tablet would be beneficial. That's just my
    opinion though.\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about brainstorming phase, ideas, sketching
    etc. then I suppose you'd be better off getting your concepts out with a tablet."

  body: "After making the switch to a tablet, I don't think I'll return to using a
    mouse for anything other than web-browsing. Everyone works differently, but for
    me, whether it is drawing with vector tools or pixel pushing, my hand can move
    much more freely across the canvas, and with more accuracy. I find that it is
    more comfortable than using a mouse, however, strangely enough, I have developed
    a callous on my pinky finger (aka Wacom Callous\u2122) from the way I hold the
    pen. :) Don't let this scare you -- I haven't yet come across anyone else with
    this problem.\r\n\r\n"

    between sizes? 4x5 vs 6x8 or between the versions? Graphire vs. Intuos?

  body: "Hi, I'd strongly recommend the 6\"x8\". I used a 4\"x5\" for a day and found
    it to be a little limiting, but it might be better if you want portability and
    something to work on your lap!\r\n\r\nThe difference between Graphire and Intuos
    is that the latter has more degrees of pressure sensitivity (512 to 1024). I'm
    not sure if this difference is tangible but I use an old Intuos2 and it's great."

  body: You can trace artwork under the wacom but the results probably won't be good,
    I think it's a little impractical as it's likely that the artwork will be bigger
    than the wacom surface. It's better off using good eye-hand co-ordination and
    draw directly onto the screen.
