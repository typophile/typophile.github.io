    looked like. (And the 'e' seems to be the 'a', rotated by 180\xB0)\r\nStill looking.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    I guess 'handmade'/customized, because the proportions of the single characters
    dont really work or match.\r\n\r\nDav"

    Katakana version.\r\n\r\nIf you have them, a good place to start looking would
    be on the Font Pavilions discs:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/pavilion/\r\n"

  body: "Small update: Still looking.\r\n\r\nIn trying to trace this in Illustrator
    (not going well, this is definitely a skill I don't possess), I noticed that the
    'e' isn't EXACTLY the same as the 'a' flipped upside-down. It's close, but slightly
    different.\r\n\r\nStill hoping this is actually a font so I don't have to settle
    for my quite poor Illustrator trace. :)\r\n"
