  body: "These are manufactured letters, and don't necessarily have anything to do
    with computer fonts. It (surprisingly) turns out that this is not that easy to
    match when you take the combined structural attributes into consideration: The
    straight-sided M, the straight-leg R, the offset K arms, and the openness of the
    S. A G would help, but anyway, I thought the font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/threepoints-west/\">Threepoints
    West</a> was a fairly close match. It would have been nice if it had a heavier
    weight, but some added stroke could take care of that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
