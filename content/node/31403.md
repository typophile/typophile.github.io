body: "First of all, I wasn't sure whether to post this font here, in the Display
  forum or the Experimental forum.\r\nI've tried to make a legible (and I use that
  term broadly) font with a 10 pixel limit for each glyph while respecing each character's
  characteristics (ascenders/descenders). I'm not sure if I succeeded at this, after
  all, I kn\xF2w what it's supposed to be, but I do like the outcome of it."

  body: I've updated the font with uppercase characters & slight changes to the lowercase
    l, m & w. I also made new numbers.

  body: Check out my Fourmat, further down the Bitmap Text page. It's interesting
    how we were able to achieve significantly different styles with these parameters.

  body: Interesting indeed, but what might explain a lot is that I didn't want to
    make diagonal corners with "wandering pixels" which obviously makes a look a lot
    heavier.

  body: Hey cerulean, I considered your comment as a challenge & made a pixel font
    (see Micro3) according to your parameters (also using "wandering pixels" this
    time) just for comparison & -obviously- this one is a lot more like your Fourmat
    (nice name BTW)... Even the capital B which I found quite a challenge turned out
    pretty much the same, but then again, there's only so many ways to make a letter
    using a limited amount of pixels.

  body: The new z there is nifty. And I was indeed impressed with the  contiguous-area
    aspect of Micropolis.
