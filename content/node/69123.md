  of my classroom project.\r\n_\r\nNow looking for a typeface to use in my mock-up
  pages.\r\nHave read up on Sassoon, designed for children. \r\nAlso looked at rounded
  fonts, like Helvetica Rounded and \r\nVAG Rounded, but the i, j, l and t are quite
  confusing.\r\n_\r\nPlease can anyone tell me what other choices I have?\r\nAnd what
  all should I take into account?\r\nAlso, do I need to place this query in the Type
  ID forum?\r\n_\r\nThank you all in advance."

    think you have to go out of your way too far for any particular typeface that
    isn''t also readable by yourself. '

  body: "~aluminium, Thank you. I'll write a few lines there too.\r\nOne thing I forgot
    to mention, English isn't their mother toungue.\r\n_\r\nI might go with a not-too-slanted
    Italic Slab Serif. \r\nI also want to avoid non-handwriting-like elements in k,
    g, a etc."
