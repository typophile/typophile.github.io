body: "I'm a student and was wondering about a particular font and whether or not
  it can be used in a logo design or a poster for a school assignment. Or can this
  font be used for an actual logo design? I'd just like to know what sort of licensing
  it has.\r\n\r\nThere was a font used for the Venice Biennale 2012 by John Morgan
  Studio. I've e-mailed directly to his studio about licensing and what not and so
  far received no response. (Most likely very busy, no time to address a student)\r\n\r\nSo
  I thought I would ask here. This bespoke typeface was created specifically for this
  event. Some of the characters are available in png image format online. I've tried
  to find fonts remotely close to this typeface but none compare. I am more than willing
  to invest in a as good a typeface as the one he created. But of course, without
  wondering why, it's definitely not sold online. \r\n\r\nUltimately I'd like to know,
  if I redrew 7 letters to use in a poster design or logo design would I be breaking
  copyright laws?\r\n\r\n(Please forgive the fact that I am a neophyte in these matters
  and have patience explaining! That'd be awesome!)"

    personal experience I'd advise to make small changes to the letter shapes. This
    practice is done by most of today's type designers when designing a font which
    looks very similar to another. "

  body: Agree with 5star's comments. If it's just for a school project that only a
    few people will see, they probably wouldn't object, but still I wouldn't copy
    characters exactly without reading the license first or getting permission.
