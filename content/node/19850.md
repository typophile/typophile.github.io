  \r\n\r\nThe fonts I have picked for the project are\r\n\r\nSans \u2013 Headline\tSerif
  \u2013 Body Text\r\n\r\nFF Scala Sans and Serif or\r\nFF Nexus Sans and Serif or\r\nFF
  Absara Sans and Serif\r\n\r\nI wanted to use Gill Sans initially, but I think it
  is overused and besides there is no Gill Serif to go with it. IMHO these fonts though
  resemble it, are actually better.\r\n\r\nIf you guys were to pick 2 pairs among
  these what would it be? Better if anyone of you can tell me what the actual difference
  between them is and which to go for.\r\n\r\nPlease help me with your expertise in
  this regard. I would be grateful for the same.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nlordkv\r\n\r\nP.S
  - I have attached the preview versions of all three in order of Scala (Left), Nexus
  (Right) and Absara (Below)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like Absara because Scala is being over done these days. Scala's presentaion
    is art-deco meets industrial europe- like DIN. Absara is geometric too but more
    subtle. However, I recommend you choose the one you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso think
    about Amor from Storm Type Foundry: \r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/pdf.php?pdf=F58\r\n\r\nIts
    maybe to soft for your project though... but check out the PDF to see if you like
    it.\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "<cite>...and besides there is no Gill Serif to go with it.</a>\r\n\r\nActually,
    there sort of is a \"Gill Serif.\" <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=M.125983.0.0\">Joanna</a>,
    which is designed by Eric Gill is often used as Gill Sans' serifed counterpart.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also find that Gill Sans/Joanna have much in common with Scala Sans/Scala.
    From what I understand, Martin Majoor closely studied Gill's designs when creating
    the Scala family.\r\n\r\nAs for Gill Sans being overused, I don't think anyone
    can justly fault you if you use it well."

    but needed second opinion. Amor is beautiful might actually be tempted to go for
    it. Joanna hmmm this is certainly the serif I wanted, now I am confused. Will
    see it in detail and decide. Appreciate your help guys.\r\n\r\nLordKV"

  body: "I think Amor is too stylish for a medical brochure.\r\n\r\nI never knew about
    the Gill/Joanna connection and can't say I really see it, especially in the italics.\r\n\r\nGill
    Sans is a maddeningly incomplete family, I like Scala (I'm less familiar with
    Nexus & Absara) because it has an expert collection, native small caps, etc. Ultimately
    you'll find you get a lot of bang for your buck with the FF families."

    agree with Patty, the detailing in Amor serif is too severe for something like
    this."

    I will go for Scala Serif and Sans. Just out of curiosity, what are the other
    best combinations. I have 2 in mind\r\n\r\n1. Auto and Dolly\r\n2. The usual Helvetica
    Neue and Garamond Pro.\r\n\r\n$ is not a issue so please feel to suggest me what
    you guys think is the best or currently the most sought after."

  body: "Seria seems like Nexus. The long ascenders and descenders seems appropriate
    for texts in books though. Not sure about brochure although the readability will
    certainly be enhanced. Definitely not Quadraat as its x height is too much and
    Priori is a bit too fancy. No disrespect just my thoughts .I am grateful as you
    are kind enough to help me. Yeah luckily dough is not a factor at all as i get
    good returns from it. \r\n\r\nFedra's good but not sure about it as not seen it
    in action. Will keep my options open though as I have time to decide."
