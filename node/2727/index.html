		<div class="commentbody">Whoa - I've never heard of this. Is it some new British thing? <BR> <BR>How do they equate results from this research for a logo design <BR>with no name, is the answer that blue is better and red didn't work for your <BR>company called 'Company A Inc.'? <BR> <BR>Looks like Richard's client wasn't even testing type or colour on their market. Was the test only about a gradient? Was that research oriented or for printability? <BR> <BR>And finally why would any company do this? Sounds like a waste of money that could otherwise be spent on their product or service. Sounds like some clients don't trust our skill, <BR>or a matter of watching over our shoulders while we work, plain ol disrespect <BR>or is this the final answer that would hold all designers liable for our work. <BR> <BR> <BR>-t <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In this case the first image was supplied to companies who were actually going to manufacture product with this new branding, in our case, reflective badges for high-visibility jackets. <BR> <BR>I can only imagine(and hope, for the client's sake!) that the design and evaluation process had already been carried out. <BR> <BR>This sort of thing is very useful in a production environment. It isn't usually as good as this when our client is the end user's garment supplier, and we get all the right information from the start. <BR> <BR>A more common situation goes something like this: <BR> <BR>A freight company somewhere in England. <BR>A decision is taken to obtain high-visibility jackets. <BR>The guy who normally places orders(probably knows all there is to know about truck tyres) rings his contact in an industrial supply company(who happens to major in packing tape and warehouse supplies). <BR>Tapeman speaks to somebody in our sales department(very keen, but can't always tell how many colours make up CMYK) and asks for a quote for , say it was the GIST  image above, a two colour badge. <BR>If we're really lucky they'll fax us a photocopy of the logo as well. <BR> <BR>BTW the first image above was a scan of an old inkjet print I had hanging around, so there isn't much colour management going on here. <BR> <BR></div>
