body: Does anyone know which script typeface was used for the word 'The' on this logo?
  It's possible it's custom but Anagrama seems to mostly base their logos off existing
  typefaces.

  body: kthomps5 I agree with the tail being sport-esque but Metroscript doesn't have
    the thick and thin feel that the logo has. The logo script is a bit more elegant/formal.

  body: The closest I've been able to find is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/">Sterling
    Script</a> and it's really not all that close. Is there anyone on this forum with
    a keen eye for script identification?

  body: "Tylor, while Anagrama may be known for basing their logos on actual fonts,
    there is the possibility that this was hand-drawn or a custom font by local designer,
    and not commercially available. \r\n\r\nThe folks on this board are fairly perspicacious--if
    anyone had recognized it straight off, they'd have spoken up.\r\n\r\nI've scanned
    through all 1000+ calligraphic scripts on Myfonts, and no match. Also no match
    to the 140+ fonts that supposedly include \"tail\" ornaments in their character
    sets. The following two fonts, however, may be closer to the feel of the original
    than Metroscript:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/lavinia/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/samantha-upright-script/"
