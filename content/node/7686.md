  body: One suggestion is to find an old typewriter font like Blake Haber&#39;s &#39;Love
    Letter&#39;&#40; see this <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11180.html?1054058415"
    target="_blank">old Typophile thread</a>&#41;. Most servicemen during the 40&#39;s
    were likey to see typewritten mail &#40;if it wasn&#39;t handwritten&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Blake told me it was from his grandparents&#39; typewriter.

    In fact, this whole series, which goes from the 20s through the 70s so far, is
    a great resource for period design ideas.
