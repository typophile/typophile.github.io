  I'm sure I should know what it is off the top of my head, pretty sure it's a MS
  Word font - but I can't reproduce it in Illustrator and it's driving me crazy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simonetteLewisLogo_3431.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  used on <a href=\"http://www.simonettelewis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this website</a>
  but only in the logo\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
