    would be \"National First\"\r\n\r\nanother dotted font I personally love is \"Fortuna
    Dot\" which you can find it here http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/fortunadot.html,
    it isn't anything like the one you are looking for, but still worth checking out
    :)\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: "Chris, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/xlt/|Avant
    Garde Gothic extra light]] is slightly different in the details of the letterforms,
    but certainly what you suggest will get much closer than the previous suggestions.\r\n\r\n-
