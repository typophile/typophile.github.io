  anybody offer any help?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBZA"

  body: "You can do this with a Robofab pen, although I've been told that Fontlab
    has stability issues with fonts that use the same component numerous times. But
    for something this simple I would probably just do all the work by tracing over
    the glyphs in Illustrator with a custom brush and then import the finished glyphs
    back into Fontlab. If you go that route be sure to read the documentation on using
    Fontlab with Illustrator <em>before</em> you start. \r\n\r\nYou'll also have to
    re-draw some glyphs because not everything in Futura is going to work as a dotted
    lines. And the spacing and kerning will likely need an overhaul if you need to
    use the font for anything other than all-caps headlines. If you need to hire someone
    to work that out drop me a line, jp@dunwichtype.com."

    hoping I could do this in Illustrator \u2013 I've never used Font Lab before."

  body: Your best option is probably to redraw the letters as single strokes & then
    either apply a dotted line to them or put dots at the end of your strokes & use
    the blend tool (replacing the spine with your strokes). I'd opt for the latter
    option 'cause it tends to give better results & you can still play around with
    the specified number of steps used.

  body: "If your only doing ten glyphs, I'd recommend just biting the bullet and doing
    it by hand.\r\nI can't see you getting happy results from a brush.\r\n\r\nIntersections
    like the bar on the A, and curves like the S will require some optical adjustment
    to feel even.\r\nTry to use maths to your advantage too, pick a good cap height
    that will divide neatly into the dimensions of your circles."

  body: The intersections are the main reason I suggested using the blend tool. You
    can put dots at all intersections & fill the strokes with the best amount of steps.

  body: I don't disagree - I just think the sake of 10 glyphs, doing it by hand and
    knowing you have a consistent pattern of distribution is probably the most efficient
    method.
