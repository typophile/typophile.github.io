    you want to do is smoothly ramp up the curvature from zero (on the straights)
    up to a maximum at the 45 degree point, then back down to zero. To do that <em>right</em>
    takes more than one Bezier segment, as shown by this illustration:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rounded-box_4860.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    that the control points of the corner knots are colinear with the straight segments.
    That's an indication that the curvature will actually be zero at the straight-curve
    join.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

    body: "Raph,\r\n\r\nGiven a cubic Bezier segment with endpoints P0 and P3 and
      prescribed curvatures K0 and K3 at each end, is it always possible to add a
      point (ie, subdivide the curve into two Bezier segments) and change the control
      points such that the new curve has continuous curvature, including at the endpoints?
      \ If not, is there any fixed number of points that can be added to guarantee
      continuous curvature?\r\n\r\nIn the example with the square O, it is impossible
      to guarantee continuous curvature without adding any points.  Because of the
      diagonal symmetry, it's relatively easy to see which point to add.  Do you know
      how one would do this in general?  It seems that there are enough degrees of
      freedom to guarantee this, but I don't see an easy way of calculating this.
      \ For instance, is the new point always on the original curve?  If so, I assume
      that it's not always the midpoint, but I'm not sure how to calculate the location.\r\n\r\nIf
      this could be worked out, it could provide a nice way of \"smoothing\" contours
      so that they have continous curvature after the rough shape of the contour is
      described with just a few points. Consider, for instance, describing a D with
      just 5 points, and then adding the extra points on the curve to \"smooth\" the
      contour.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nStephen\r\n"

    subdivide the closer you can cut it. You can get away with just one, but two is
    probably going to be noticeably better.\r\n\r\nI wish I could quantify this better

    corners. it doesn\u2019t seem logical to me, could you please explain further?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    can try. One of my favorite ways of \"seeing\" curves is to look at what happens
    to the curvature. That's a mathematical concept, but there is an intuitive physical
    metaphor for it. Imagine driving a car along the outline, and imagine what's happening
    to the steering wheel.\r\n\r\nIn your first example, which is essentially a quarter-circle
    arc joined to a straight line, you'd be driving along straight, then turn the
    wheel very sharply to match the curvature of the circle, hold it there until you'd
    turned 90 degrees, then turn it very sharply back to the center.\r\n\r\nIn your
    last example (which <em>is</em> much smoother), you'd begin the turn much earlier,
    and the sudden jerk of the wheel would be a lot less, then as you approached the
    corner, you'd turn it reasonably smoothly to a peak at the 45 degree point, then
    reasonably smoothly back. The peak (maximum position of the wheel), however, is
    quite a bit more curvature than it is in the first example, and that's one important
    measure of curve smoothness.\r\n\r\nIn my example, curvature is continuous and
    quite smooth - no sudden jerks of the wheel. Further, the peak is broader than
    in your second example (you spend more time with the wheel near its maximum position)
    which means it doesn't need as tight a turn at the very middle.\r\n\r\nIt all
    depends on what you're trying to achieve. Your second example isn't bad, but if
    you want to achieve the effect of a box with smoothly rounded corners, then as
    I say you'll need an extra Bezier point. In my experience, Beziers are not very
    intuitive - when you're drawing with them, it's way too easy to get sharp changes
    in curvature. I predict that before too long, type designers will embrace a more
    intuitive curve primitive than Beziers, one that guarantees certain properties
    of curve smoothness, and there will be tools to automatically convert to standard
    formats such as OpenType.\r\n"

    what the Underware diagram is urging you to avoid, and instead to do something
    like the 1:23 post of Goran. It's all geometric, of course, but I think what Underware
    was arguing that simple circles are not as good as more complex shapes. It think
    it's all about what will work in the particular design, but Underware's view was
