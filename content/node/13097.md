body: "I have a following problem (FL4.6, Windows).\r\n\r\nI have a typeface with
  full set of small caps glyphs. I didn't assign an Unicode index to these glyphs.
  I want to import a separate AMF file containing kerning pairs:\r\n\r\nKPX d.small
  a.small -60\r\n\r\nBut FL refuses to add such pairs unless I assign Unicode index
  to small caps glyphs. Is there any way, HOW to import kerning pairs for all the
  glyphs, regardless on Unicode index?\r\n\r\nI don't want to make separate font,
  copy small caps, remove 'small' suffix, import AFM, add suffix and copy small caps
  glyphs to the main font. It is too complicated. I also don't want to temporarily
  assign Unicode indices..."

    word 'kerning' in the title.)\r\n\r\nFilip, you've probably solved this by now.
    But anyway, here's a small Python script that does the job. You'll need Robofab
    installed.\r\n\r\n<code>#FLM: AFM Kerning Importer\r\nfrom robofab.world import
    CurrentFont\r\nfrom robofab.interface.all.dialogs import GetFile\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nPairsBefore
    = len(f.kerning.keys())\r\nprint 'Pairs before:', PairsBefore\r\npath = GetFile(\"Open
    AFM file\")\r\nf.kerning.importAFM(path, clearExisting=False)\r\nPairsAfter =
    len(f.kerning.keys())\r\nprint 'Pairs after:', PairsAfter\r\nprint 'Pairs added:',
    PairsAfter - PairsBefore</code>\r\n\r\nThe script also gives information about
    the number of pairs added, just as a checker."
