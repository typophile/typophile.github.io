		<div class="commentbody">InD is very compulsive (even more so than PageMaker) about wanting to revert text boxes to the default: the solution is to make the default your "usual" text box, or to fire up various standard templates as what you really want to do.

The solution(s) (is)are:

1. Set your default text boxes when you open up the applications but no documents are opened (this is detailed in the Help files),
2. Create a range of templates for various clients,
3. Make your default dead simple, and tinker for each document.

I use a combination of 1 and 2 but YMMV....</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the whole I find indesign to be fine, sure it shuts down regularly but I ask a lot of it. I got into design using photoshop mainly so moving to indesign for page layout was easy, the layout seemed very intuitive whereas Quark seemed remote, aloof and unfriendly. I can't say I've noticed it trying to think for me, although Microsfoft word is another story... "sorry did you want to make that a bulleted list with really generous tabs? Done" "Oh right, so that looks like a weblink so you must want it underlined in blue, no don't thank me"...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It may sound a bit compulsive, but it's actually a pretty cool feature. You can set a default for a whole document and/or individual text boxes. You have to figure that when you open a new text box the style will have to default to <cite>something</cite>... if you're used to using other Adobe products then you probably expect that <cite>something</cite> to be the most recently used style. In Indesign's case it will be whatever style settings were selected prior to the document being open. Here's the explanation from Indesign help:

<cite>If you change settings when no documents are open, your changes set the defaults for new documents. If a document is open when you change settings, the changes affect only that document.
Similarly, if you change settings when no objects are selected, your changes set the defaults for new objects.</cite>

And defaults are fully scriptable, so everyone working on a project can be using the same defaults and, trust me, that's a beautiful thing :)</div>
