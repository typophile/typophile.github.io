    around 200.000 fonts,\r\nand the results are:\r\n\r\n<strong>any.jpg:</strong>
    nothing close\r\n\r\n<strong>marisu.jpg:</strong> \r\nLooks a bit similar to <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/arista-2-0.font?text=Piclot|Arista
    2.0 Alternate full]]</strong>\r\nbut I think it's more \"similar in concept\"
    than a copy\r\n\r\n<strong>OSCAR2.jpg:</strong> nothing close\r\n\r\n<strong>crimi.jpg:</strong>
    nothing close\r\n\r\n<strong>sheila.jpg:</strong>\r\nSorry to reveal, but this
    is a cheat:\r\nIt matches exactly <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/mias-scribblings.font?text=PQRST|Mia's
    Scribblings]]</strong>\r\n\r\n...therefore, I have to say you must be proud -in
    overall- for your students,\r\nbecause if they cheated, they did it in a smart
    way by choosing uncommon fonts\r\nwhich are difficult to spot :) \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nFivos"

    said \"lucky them\" NOT because I consider it to be a demeaning job, or unimportant...
    \r\nbut they don't have the ability to design fonts, no one would hire them.\r\n\"I

    unfortunately, have very little to do with each other these days. The focus seems
    to have moved from crafted, thought through pieces of communication to cookie
    cutter ideas that come a dime a dozen. \r\n\r\nEither way. Typography is a skill
    and an art form. The people that create these beautifully crafted shapes should
    be respected more in the creative industry.\r\n\r\nGustav"
