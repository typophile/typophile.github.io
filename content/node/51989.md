body: "Hi friends,\r\n\r\nI've been asked to design a logo for our R&D department.\r\nWe
  are in the aerospace business, more precisely business aircrafts.\r\n\r\nThe logo
  should express leadership, state of the art product and facility, high tech, discrete
  luxury and be comtemporary.\r\n\r\nThe logo will be used mainly on lanyards, coffee
  mugs and internal communications.\r\n\r\nCould you guide me with fonts / layout?\r\nPlease
  help to bring it to the next level! \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I like the one on the bottom left. Nice ampersand. The right leg of the \"R\"
    is a bit funky \u2014 looks stretched to me. Although I like the idea of the ampersand
    leading into the \"flight streak\" of the plane, I don't really like how it tapers
    down towards the plane. Try making the plane bigger so that it matches up better
    with the thickness of the ampersand (and you wouldn't need to taper the trail).
    Also try it without the trail through the \"D\".\r\n\r\nGood start here.\r\n\r\npenn"

    got inspired by Richard Branson's private island logo : [[www.neckerisland.com]]
    and the New Regency logo : [[www.newregency.com]] . \r\n\r\nI tried \"the squeezed
    look\" (top right) but I'm not sure it's the appropriate direction, maybe too
    wannabe futuristic? I want to keep it quite geometric and not too organic.\r\n\r\nWorked
    a lot on the letters and ampersand, everything is custom. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nStill
    not too sure what to do with the aircraft... any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R&D

    box  that would allow you to attach / directly insert an image into your comment
    box. There also are tips on how to insert links and other formatting details below
    the comment box (as your links above don't lead to where you want them to). \r\n\r\nThese
    latest sketches are good, but I prefer the ampersand from the bottom left (with
    the closed top) as opposed to the ones you've been playing around with in these
    later sketches. The lettering is looking a little futuristic to me in these newer
    sketches because of the pieces taken out of the \"R\" and the \"D\". I do like
    the airyness of these later iterations (due both to the increased spacing and
    also the outlining of the characters. Lot's of good ideas to experiment with here.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "The plane is almost certainly too detailed compared to the rest of the logo.
    So simplify it a bit. Ampersand adds quite a substantial amount of detail into
    the logo but it's too sans serif to complement the details of the plane.\r\n\r\nTo
    me the most promising logo was #4 in the first batch of logos. It connects both
    letters and the plane and doesn't leave R outside of the mark.\r\n\r\nLogos with
    only half the plane don't work with me.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. If you'll combine
    outlines with flats (as in logos in the second batch), be very careful about it
    because it usually tends to complicate application if not done properly.\r\n\r\nBut
    other wise type choice is very good for R&D lab.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "First, thank you all for the comments.\r\nIt's always nice to have advices
    and encouragement from professionals (I'm not a typographer nor a graphic designer...)!\r\n\r\nI
    tried a new variant today. Please check attached image.\r\nPersonaly I like it
    because it's simpler and more compact.\r\n\r\nI wonder if :\r\n- right leg of
    R should be widened a bit\r\n- if D is ok as is\r\n- does it still reads as R&D
    even without the ampersand\r\n- do you still think the aircraft should be simplified
    or it complements and add richness to the type?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help!\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/R&Dlogo4.jpg]]"

  body: "Does it actually matter that it has to read R&D, because I think to me it's
    the same either RD or R&D.\r\n\r\nthe serif style of the plane is now more appropriate
    since you introduced stroke variation to the letters thus complementing them to
    the plane.\r\n\r\nI think that plane in the middle is also a very nice solution.
    Did you also try to add a mid line before R to symbolise plane trail? Just an
    idea. Try if it works. It may unballance R since it's more wide on top than bottom
    (missing stem)...\r\n\r\nYou could remove tapered wing ends. It's the only one
    thing that feels distracting on the plane to me... And try moving the plane a
    bit more to the left because it looks like it's closer to D at the top than bottom
    or is it just me...\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
