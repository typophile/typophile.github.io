  New York Times article reviews the COOL-ER</a>, a British e-book reader:\r\n\r\n\"You
  have a choice of eight type sizes. Unfortunately, performing a type-size change
  requires \u2014 no joke \u2014 16 key presses, each requiring about 20 pounds of
  force.\"\r\n\r\nOuch."

    than Amazon\u2019s or Sony\u2019s.\"\r\n\r\nWell, maybe it has some merit then.
    Plus, hey, it's green!"

    someone gave the branding team too much coffee."
