    has not yet been released - sounds worth a look when it comes out - anyone seen
    a review copy?'

  body: "Completely weirdly and coincidentally, just last week I finished an InDesign
    course here in London taught by Nigel French... he was talking about his new book.\r\n\r\nAs
    a tutor, I would say his strengths lay in type rather than repro. He's just returned
    back to the UK from a few years in San Francisco and New York.\r\n\r\nLovely bloke,
    though. So you have to buy his book. :)"
