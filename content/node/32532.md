body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone can assist with some troubleshooting. I've
  spent three days trying to solve this and it's killing me.\r\n\r\nI've taken an
  existing font family, modified just it's name and regenerated it using FontLab.
  I've output to OpenType/TT format, and made sure to have recreated all the various
  family and table information using FontLab's built in automated naming. \r\n\r\nAll
  the various weights of the font work perfectly fine in every app I've tried except
  for in Microsoft Word, where my client needs it the most. What happens is that some
  weights get totally ignored. All the weight names appear in the menu but the Normal
  and Medium (irgnored) render identically, as do the Bold and DemiBold (ignored).
  If I remove the fonts that are working, then the ones that used to be ignored then
  work fine \u2013 so there is some kind of problem with the family naming. From what
  I understand I've named them properly according to OpenType's requirements.\r\n\r\nI'm
  running OS X 10.4.8. FontLab Studio 5.0.2\r\n\r\nHas anyone come across this? What
  am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nG"

    issues like this. I mean, what is the \"build names\" function in FontLab really
    there for, if not for making it work across platforms and applications?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What's the format of the fonts you're opening? If it's OpenType (either TT
    or CFF), then the best way to change the fonts' name is:\r\n\r\n1. In FontLab's
    preferences, under \"Opening OpenType & TrueType\" select \"Read all OpenType
    name records\"\r\n2. In Font Info window, under \"Names and Copyright\" edit the
    entries in the panel \"Additional OpenType names\"\r\n3. In FontLab's preferences,
    under \"Generating OpenType & TrueType\" select \"Export only OpenType name records
    - ignore default names\"\r\n4. Generate the OpenType font (TT or CFF)"

    body: "Thanks Mark. I came across that same page later that night and went through
      the instructions in detail. I'm pleased to say that it's finally working now
      althought the style names that appear are different between Mac and PC, so any
      document templates need to be font speced twice for each platform.\r\n\r\nI
      find it strange that these same instructions come from the same people who make
      FontLab. The 'automated' naming feature in Fontlab only appears to half work
      in that case, becase the instructions in the guide produce totally different
      results than what FontLab's auto feature creates. I realise that FontLab can't
      assume what a families naming structure should be, however it be great if it
      could assess the fonts that are open at the same time and then populte the fields
      based on the strucutre of the family."

    I so totally agree on this. I don\u2018t get the point in having a naming feature
    in the market leading font software, when it doesnt produce a fully compatible
    font."

    of the problems is that applicaton and operating system vendors do not fully document
    the naming behaviors. We try to investigate the different behaviors but it's not
    always trivial. \r\n\r\nWe do hope that in future versions of our applications,
    we will be able to improve the naming user interface. \r\n\r\nA."
