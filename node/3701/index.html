  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">How does one calculate appropriate licensing fees for broadcast? Specifically a network television sitcom using freeware fonts for opening credits? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both MTV's The Osbournes and CBS's Still Standing are using my freeware fonts primarily in the main title sequences of both shows. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the case of The Osbournes, the font usage has spilled out into licensed merchandise and continues to grow the brand based upon my work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm usually not a stickler about licensing nor am I trying to be greedy and take money out of the franchise. I do however feel that if a major network is going to use a typeface as the basis of the brand of the show that they would attempt to compensate the typeface creator by acquiring the appropriate licensing for the font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While it is truly flattering and I'm excited to see the fonts in use so notibly, no attempts to contact me have been made by either network. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I open it up to the group to offer any advice, opions, or suggestions as to what would be fair compensation for the usage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the ear, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had contacted MTV but they were not at all responsive and frankly I don't have the $$$ to sick a lawyer on them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are correct, there are no specific terms in my freeware licensing that would protect the fonts from use without some commercial license in place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other thoughts that I had entertained were to revised the license on my freeware faces to include something to the effect of if it's used for broadcast the Font Diner must be credited or a commercial license must be purchased. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I tell people they must purchase a commercial license for commercial use, I'll get a ton of e-mail from individuals wanting to use it on their business cards and websites. Those aren't the folks I am concenred with as much as I am a major network or company. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another great suggestion I received was to create a &quot;pro&quot; version of the fonts and release them as commercial quality at either my site or My Fonts. Right now, the fonts were done very early in my font making career and are quite techincally poor quality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps it would encourage people to pay up for the better versions. Not becuase I intended it that way by releasing a lower quality first font, but becuase the older version is really quite horrid. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart</div>

Not by MTV or the production company who did the titling, but by the artist who designed the credits because font licensing was his responsibility to MTV. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh well, the license expires each season, so if I see the faces used come fall, you can bet another invoice will be showing up in MTV's mailbox. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart :D</div>
