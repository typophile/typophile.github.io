  interface design, Typophile seems to be the best and most streamlined, letting the
  discussions take center stage. Most of the forums seem to be use stock themes from
  Vbulletin/phpBB and end up looking cluttered.Forums using bbpress look neat but
  all I want to ask is this: Is Typophile the best designed forum? and why aren't
  there more well designed forums out there?\r\n\r\nbtw it would be really really
  helpful if you can point me to other well designed forums online. I've been searching
  for quite some time now and haven't found anything worth mentioning.Thank you, hope
  my questions aren't out of place here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

    (see the sub forum \u201CJoe\u2019s corner\u201D for critique), but I agree that
    it looks and reads better than most stock forums."

    in Front]] which has \u2013 just recently \u2013 been rebuilt from scratch. Looking
    at it now I would say the line length is a bit long, but on the whole it is well
    designed. \r\n\r\nWith Typophile the only thing that bugs me is the flash on the
    home page. I like the way it brings the \"Hottest\", \"Newest\" and \"Handpicked\"
    to the front, however I don't like how I can't open multiple tabs from the flash
    object."

  body: I kinda like the way <a href="http://forum.freelanceswitch.com">Freelance
    Switch's</a> looks. But the discussion pages are a little too generous with space
    for my taste. Takes up an awful lot of the screen. I need to zoom out two steps
    at least, in order to be comfortable.
