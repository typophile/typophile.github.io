body: "I can't find a picture of, but I am looking for a modern serif that looks like
  Bodoni Poster Italic without the thin lines. The typeface uses imaginary lines to
  connect each stroke. \r\n\r\nSorry if this isn't clear enough\u2014still trying

  body: Kind of, but it's more script-like. It looks a like Memoriam, but with out
    the thin lines.
