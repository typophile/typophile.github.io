body: "Now at just over two, my son, Erik, is in love with letters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erik_2009-08_5879.jpg]\r\nHe's
  tracing the letters on the side of the train car we rode at Train Town in Sonoma.
  I think he liked the sign more than the train ride!\r\n\r\nSome things I'm learning
  from him:\r\nZ is N\r\nW is M\r\n3 is M and sometimes E\r\n8 is B\r\nEvery F should
  transform into an E\r\nEvery C should transform into an E\r\nWhen you pronounce
  \"R\" it needs to really sound like a pirate, \"AAAAAARRRRRR!\"\r\n"
