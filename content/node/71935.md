  body: From the shape of the very fuzzy S, I would venture to guess that it's some
    flavor of DIN 1451...

  body: Apologies regarding the quality, this is a screen capture of an Youtube video.
    As for DIN, the 'W' or 'J' are not even close, I think it's another.

  body: "So we are looking for a technical-looking sans-serif: straight \u2018R\u2019
    leg, no \u2018G\u2019 bar, \u2018M\u2019 vertex above baseline, \u2018W\u2019
    is more or less an upside-down \u2018M\u2019, \u2018N\u2019 diagonal meets right
    stem above baseline, bar-less \u2018I\u2019, \u2018J\u2019 with top bar, flat-top
    \u20183\u2019 \u2026\r\n\r\nI tried Identifont, without results."

  body: "I guess I tried all the same things Florian did. Identifont was a letdown,
    not even tracking my choices very well. I once contacted the page owner and he
    admitted that some of the logic has flaws, but he sounded indifferent about fixing
    them. He has a great site, except for that attitude, if you ask me. If your tool
    doesn't work the way it's supposed to, then fix it. I used my own Sans Serif Font
    ID Guide, but it's too incomplete yet to find enough families for this.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I agree that the W is probably an inverted M. If I use that logic, the only letter
    I find difficult is the N. I suppose that would be an easy enough customization,
    but I am surprised NBC would go to that trouble. My candidate for a starting point
    font would be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/anisette-std/\">Anisette</a>
    by Porchez. The lower case letters are narrow caps and seem to be close enough
    to this lettering, as well as I can tell from the fuzzy graphic. The only letter
    that would take any alteration seems like the N. Just replace the W with an inverted
    M.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "the S in Anisette doesn't match.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should ignore the N and
    find similar fonts to NBC's then assume the font was tamper with or mixed. I've
    mixed fonts when I didn't like the way certain letters looked."
