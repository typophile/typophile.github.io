body: "This past week I spent researching calligraphic engraving at the Harry Ransom
  Center (HRC) at University of Texas at Austin. HRC archives hold many copybook (or
  copy book) specimens, three \"The Universal Penman\" by George Bickham, great master
  of this highly specialized craft in 18th-century England, one beautiful copy is
  in the fabulous bound Beaufoy, H.B.H., collection of English, German and Dutch writing
  manuals.\r\n\r\nI examined over 1,460 individual engraved plates either bound or
  tipped-in to these books or the Beaufoy collection.  There are exquisite examples
  of engraved calligraphy but of greater interest to me was being able to look at
  the structure of engraved letter forms.  I was able to bring with me, and use, the
  3X photographic loop, with excellent optics, so was able to see some great detail.\r\n\r\nI
  will be writing my observations here in my blog.  Meanwhile, anyone interested in
  the genre can go to this bibliography about origins of letter forms including writing
  and copy books:\r\n\r\nhttp://ihl.enssib.fr/siteihl.php?page=45&aflng=fr.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  a reasonable copy, offset not engraved, of Bickham's \"Universal Penman\" can be
  bought as a Dover edition for fairly cheap.\r\n\r\nMy favorite specimen was a complete
  book by Snell, about 4-5 characters per page, 13 plates in all illustrating the
  entire alphabet.  At the end of which (and I could not tell if it is part of the
  Snell book or a random, tipped-in item) was a grid comparing each character in the
  alphabet for Roman, Italick [sic], two kinds of script, \"secretary\", \"church\",
  engrossing and several other forms of types.\r\n\r\nI will post pictures in the
  coming weeks, it takes four to six (weeks) for the HRC to process orders for scanning
  copies."
