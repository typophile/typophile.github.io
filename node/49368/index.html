		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with licensing the real typeface. However, doing a Google search for</p>
<p>mgopen site:typophile.com</p>
<p>will bring up a typophile node that mentions the mgopen fonts, which include a font similar to Optima. I haven&rsquo;t ever really looked closely at the quality of MGOpen Cosmetica, but I believe it is more ethical to go with an open source option than to go with downloading a pirated version of Optima.</p>
<p>For non-commercial use, there is also a URW version of Optima in the fonts released with GhostPCL:</p>
<p>[[http://www.artifex.com/downloads/|http://www.artifex.com/downloads/]]</p>
<p>Here are some other Google searches you can perform to find Typophile information on good &ldquo;free&rdquo; fonts, in all the meanings of that word.  I suggest the google searches because some of the internal typophile links to its own wiki pages seem to be out of date.</p>

<p>The type designer may think otherwise. In downloading at least the thief shows that they value and respect the work enough to pilfer it, rather than going with a forgery that someone wasn&rsquo;t even paid to produce.</p>

<p>My understanding of the fonts from URW and from the MGOpen collection was that they were typefaces released under fairly &ldquo;free&rdquo; terms from reputable sources. I apologize if it wasn&rsquo;t clear that I was limiting my comments to these particular options in this particular case.</p>
<p>In general, I know that the question of when a look-alike typeface is a forgery and when it is a legitimate copy done by a legitimate foundry is one that has come up here before, and I certainly don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to be able to add anything to that debate. I&rsquo;m also not suggesting that being licensed as open-source is more important than quality of the typeface or whether someone was appropriately paid for their work.</p>
<p>However, in this case I did try to do reasonable research into the origins of these typefaces. If my understanding of these particular typefaces is incorrect, I would certainly like to know it. When a good typeface that is created in an ethical manner is given as a gift in this way, I do feel it&rsquo;s appropriate to respect that gift by letting others know about it.</p>
