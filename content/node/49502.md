    may be able to have yours renamed because it's PHP-based. Can one of the mods
    or Punchcut confirm that please? Thanks. Accounts are not deleted because that
    messes up discussion threads and rewrites history.\r\n\r\nHauke, if you hate that
    if someone googles your name typophile shows up, you're just not realistic my
    friend. The internet really doesn't work that way. We are all doomed to live on
    in Google's cache forever.\r\n\r\nIf you are ashamed to be a Typophiler, you should
    read my thread titled Top 10 reasons why you should like Typophile. Your user
    page says you have been a member of the site for 2 years 30 weeks. Failure to
    reconcile your sense of self with whatever opinions and remarks you have posted
    here in that time smells like projection of your deepest insecurities onto the
    world's greatest typography forum. If you cannot live with your past without wishing
    to rewrite history, then <em>change</em>, Now.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Too bad they don't delete accounts :( Renaming would be even better, though
    (I would have reregistered with a more anonymous name anyways).\r\n\r\nI like
    this site, and having it in some cache doesn't bother me. (I wouldn't have used
    my real name if the <em>content</em> of the site would bother me in any way.)
    If someone's diggin' around caches, he'll take the time to actually look at the
    site and the content. What bothers me is the first impression someone gets when
    the name of the site pops up as the second or third result in the google search.
    Someone who doesn't happen to know what typo means and who wouldn't take the time
    to actually check what the site's about."

  body: "Hauke,\r\n\r\nIf you would like any of your account information changed,
    please email us at typophile [ at ] punchcut [ dot ] com.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we don't
    delete accounts, but will deactivate them or change names/words if necessary.
    Google spiders love Drupal sites, and so all the content on Typophile gets very
    high ranking upon search. Nothing we can do about it really, except help educate
    people to this fact."
