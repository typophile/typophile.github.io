  body: "Just guessing here, but this looks like a pastiche from the era of photo-lettering
    in the 1960s to 1980s.\r\nThe distinctive wedge serif on leg on the h, and the
    wedge shaped crossbar on t, are features of a pre-WWI era serifed font sold by
    American Typefounders as Invitation. The sagging bowls on g and p were the height
    of font design fashion circa 1910.\r\nCan't say if this was a full font or just
    enough to design the book title.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "ATF  1923 is a magnificent specimen publishing effort. Print copies are rare.\r\nInvitation
    is also in ATF 1934 -- a much less extensive book --at page 133. Readily available
    in an accurate reprint by Schiffer in 2007. ISBN: 978-0-7643-2770-4. Currently
    priced at only $19.95 for direct sales from the publisher.\r\nOnline copies of
    ATF 1923 & 1934 are disappointing.\r\nDon"
