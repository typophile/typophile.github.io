    characters.\r\nA is definatelly too bold, comparing with others.\r\nm, n = they
    need a bit more fixing.\r\nthat's it for the beginning."

  body: "i think you stick too much to the geometry, which is not really helpfull
    here.\r\nbesides that, it's hard to see how characters really look like, without
    an pdf."

    and I dont see where I will be going without following them. Still if you mean
    something specific I am willing to try it :)\r\n\r\nAnd you are right about the

  body: "well, there is nothing wrong with that if you use geometry as a fondation
    for your face.\r\nin my opinion you have to make some compromises to make it more
    interesting, legible and sexy, after all.\r\njust sticking to the geometry for
    the sake of it wont make your face more interesting.\r\nbut then, maybe it is
    just me. :)"

  body: "It might just be me, but there's something awkward and unstable about the
    whole font. A few things I'm noticing:\r\n\r\n1. /s/ looks like it's leaning to
    the left\r\n\r\n2. /e/ looks like it's leaning to the right when next to certain
    letters\r\n\r\n3. /t/ leaning to the right\r\n\r\n4. terminals of several letters
    appear too wide and \"chunky\" (maybe that's what you're going for though)\r\n\r\n5.
    Shoulders of /n/ and /m/ appear to slope too sharply\r\n\r\nI'm no type designer,
    so take my advice with a grain of salt, unless some more credible reinforcement
    comes along.\r\n"
