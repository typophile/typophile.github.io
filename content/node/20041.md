    which looks great. The PDF I printed out for Dederon looked to me clotted and
    not so lively. Dolly seems to me to manage to be dark, but keep liveliness and
    a degree of lightness. I admit I haven't seen Dederon in use other than the PDF,
    so probably I should just have kept quiet.  It's the internet that made me do
    it :)\r\n"

    12, while Dederon seems to be\r\noptimal for something like 10 point.\r\n\r\n>

  body: ">Dolly has a smaller x-height, so it\u2019s better\r\nat larger sizes, maybe
    around 12.\r\n\r\nLooking at the specimen book, to my eye Dolly works best at
    10 point, but is lovely at 12 pt also--though a bit dark for my taste. At smaller
    sizes, I think it could use some wider tracking than in the specimen book. \r\n\r\nHere
    is what Erik Spiekermann says in the Introduction to the specimen book: \"What
    purpose was Dolly designed for? In small sizes--the ones we read--it looks like
    a warm, comfortable Garamondish, Minion-like Roman. Close up, we notice dozens
    of subtle curves and unusual shapes. The designers have managed to walk the fine
    line between their vanity (wanting to show off how good they are) and their purpose
    (to design other people will enjoy.)\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say other nice things
    about Dolly, which I think are very deserved, as I think it is one of the best
    recent text faces--which is why I bought the specimen book at TypeCon. Count me
    a fan of Dolly. \r\n\r\nMy printer--1200 dpi Xante tuned to 'light'--does thicken
    a bit more than offset, but I think that is not the difference. I have just looked
    at a few characters large (on the fontshop site and the PDF from Suitcase) and
    Dederon is both thicker and with less contrast in the normal weight. To me it
    just goes a little too far in that direction. \r\n\r\nAlso the design of Dederon
    to me is just flat-footed compared to the lively Dolly. Again, I don't have a
    printed sample, so there may be charms to Dederon that I don't see.     "

    Dolly's letterforms. It was a hard choice, though; they seem pretty similar to

  body: "Reviving an old thread because I've used Dederon Serif recently. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure whether this would work as a book face. It is quite unlike Dolly. The
    medium weight is far too heavy. Fair enough. The light, however, looks better
    suited for Display than anything else. It looks anemic. This is all at around
    10 pts. The situation doesn't really improve at smaller sizes. In any case the
    letterspacing seems a little too wide and the x-height a little too small. All
    in all it looks like a cross between Mrs. Eaves and a slab serif. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    else notice this?"

    the page. And is it ever readable! Lexicon and Dorian are wonderful as well. I
    have a license for Dorian and I wish I could use it more often. I love all this

    is an (excellent!) typeface that was started at the Type and Media program in
    The Hague, not on the MATD course in Reading. Moreover, while there are a few
    stylistic similarities across some of the typefaces designed at Reading, I wouldn't
    say that Slab Serifs are a big theme, tackled by a majority of students there.
    Other directions seem much more prominent in my memory. FF Tisa stands out as
    a pretty unique typeface, I think."

    guess that it depends on what your definition of a slab serif is. In my opinion,
    trapezoidal serifs aren't slab serifs, for example. But if you browse all of the
    typefaces on the Reading typefaces website (<a href=\"http://www.typefacedesign.org\">http://www.typefacedesign.org</a>),
    I think your see several different kinds of investigations."
