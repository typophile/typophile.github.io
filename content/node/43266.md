  her boyfriend's birthday. Does anyone know what the font for \"Sexiest Man Alive\"
  is, or one that is similar? Its the same on each annual issue.\r\n\r\nFor the \"People\"
  logo, I just downloaded a high-res image of an original mag cover and made a path
  around the logo. So I don't need that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_27_06_UPC_300x400_4210.jpg]"

  body: "It's funny that <em>People</em> switched to <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001063.php\">Verlag</a>
    shortly after <em>Us</em> magazine redesigned using Relay. You'd think they'd
    want to set themselves apart rather than mimic.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have the chronology
    backwards. Someone correct me if I'm wrong."

  body: it is actually backwards. people magazine used a proprietary version of verlag
    before it was released officially. US then switched to relay shortly thereafter.

    give you a similar look. You could even pull it off with Futura Condensed if you
    stick to all caps."
