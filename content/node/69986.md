  body: "I looked through my Script Font ID Guide for any handwritten font with a
    'g' like that. The closest I found was Dave Nalle's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/carmilla/\">Carmilla</a>,
    which has a similar shape, but is rougher. Maybe it was traced over to smooth
    it out?\r\n\r\nI also had this nagging idea that some OpenType font has a bunch
    of alternate g's that may include this, but I couldn't guess which it might be.
    This resembles some of Philip Bouwsma's scripts, including <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/bouwsma-script/\">Bouwsma
    Script</a>, but that isn't as close as Carmilla.\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert about
    techniques, but can you autotrace the 'g'?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
