  Intermezzo II Ep in 1999, on the booklet side, song list and credits. Its pretty
  gothic, but with this nice sharp scandinavian finishing. I didnt find any font quite
  like it. So far Ness from Fountain http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ness_reg.asp
  goes closest. But i wonder if this Bodin's font is available for purchase anywhere?
  \r\n\r\nCheers"
