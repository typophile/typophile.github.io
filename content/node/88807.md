body: "Hi all,\r\nI noticed this unusual font used in the body text of a book published
  in the UK. It's a serif font with a single-story lowercase \"a.\" The closest thing
  I can find is Stone Informal, but that's still not quite it; the lower-case \"t\"
  is different, the capital \"T\" is very different, and the descenders aren't as
  hooked.\r\nHere's a link:\r\nhttp://lalenafisher.com/hidden_design_page.html\r\nIt's
  just for fun, not an urgent need for a job or anything.\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm guessing this may be a schoolbook edition of a 'normal' serif font, but
    I don't know yet which one.

  body: Interesting! I'm now curious about school book editions of fonts, and why
    publishers see a need for a special version for that purpose.

    in fact, even Times New Roman on my mac could do it.

  body: "<blockquote>IPA Extensions [...] What is it, and how do you insert one into
    a font?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOn a mac, you can see them with the character viewer;
    they start at U+0250. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ipa_6738.png]\r\nIf
    you have just a few to put  in some short text, you can just click on them in
    the viewer, like here on the script g, and it gets inserted at the cursor position.
    If you already have a text file, you can apply a global substitution. \r\n\r\nThat
    is sufficient to get a text to print, but not good to search with the Acrobat
    reader; if you search for \"narrow\", it won't find it because the a was replaced
    with some other character. To get a searchable text, you need a properly designed
    font.\r\n\r\nI have never drawn a single glyph to my satisfaction, that's why
    I look only at fonts that already contain the shapes I want. Once they are drawn,
    all you have to do is to use some font editor to add properly named copies of
    the glyphs you want to use, and opentype substitution tables, to get a working
    font that gives you the desired shape when you type and that produces searchable
    texts. Such a font will work with so called \"Opentype savvy\" applications, like
    Adobe InDesign.\r\n\r\nI should mention that there is a way to proceed without
    touching at the font (if the EULA does not allow modification). You need only
    \ design a keyboard layout that will give you the character U+0251 when you type
    \"a\" and U+0261 when you type \"g\" (there are tools for that). To search the
    pdf, you then need to use that very same keyboard layout."

    everything looks nice but the spell checker (in Word for instance) finds a mistake
    every time a word contains an IPA character.'
