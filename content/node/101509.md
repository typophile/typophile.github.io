  by the logotype. While i'm sure there are custom elements to the logotype, i'm looking
  for the base typeface, or a similar one. Really love the lowercase \"g\" and the
  small rounded terminals.\r\n\r\nYour help would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\n(Original,
  and a fixed-skewed image)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/magtiwin_6513.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/magtiwin_6082.jpg]"
