body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reggie08_5083.png]\r\n\r\nThis font is
  from Regiomontanus' calendar (we'd call it an almanac, I guess). It seems this font
  is a sort of compromise between blackletter and Roman, which maybe makes sense given
  the context.\r\n\r\nI'm posting this particular page so you can see the <em>old</em>
  old-style numbers.\r\n\r\nI know the font might not look like much in this picture.
  Some pages toward the end of the almanac are full of running text, though, and I
  think the look is kind of cool, but I can't really read German so what do I know."
