  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

I'm working on this project called Mentorskap (swedish for mentorship).

It's a practical training projekt at my school for students studying at different health care programs, social studies and physical therapy.

This project brings in people from the field to help the students with their practical training, a mentor.

I've narrowed it down to three elements that I want to present in the logo. The student, mentor and the school.

In these three sketches the student i the yellow part, the box is the school (a box with four sides representing the four years of each program) and the small line beside the yellow part is the mentor.

Any feedback you can give is much appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">Only for Finland and yes. It's a very small thing, will mostly be visible to students at my school and the places where they do they're practical training.

As for the a circle on top I'll give it a shot but it would be a fourth element that I wouldn't have an explanation for, also it might start looking like some variation of a stick figurine and I really don't want that.

Personally I like that the square symbolizes the school, studying can be very boring and repetitive. Then having the "student" breaking free and evolving is a nice thought.

Gonna try some more experiments with the first one. The arrow is kind of cliché but it doesn't look half bad.

Thanks for the feedback so far.</div>

You should consider the placement of the two elements (icon & logotype), because they're fighting a bit right now. In the earlier options, both on one line worked.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe I was a little unclear ealier. It's not supposed to directly depict a srudent or a school för that matter. An outside person looking at it is not suppose to get the idea of a school and student in their mind just the breaking free/evolving part.

This logo will only be seen by three types of people, students, their mentors and the person that the students are doing their practical training for. So for them the student and school part are already present in their mind when they come in contact with this logo.

Going to do some revisions as soon as i get feedback from the client. I think that having the type on the side next to the icon would work better. I'm also going to try to find another font, have been looking for a while but haven't founf anything that seems to fit.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks,

:D I was hoping no one would notice the macdonalds fries thing. I was worried about that but the client didn't react on it.

This logo will only be viewd on a website, fairly small. This is what I'm thinking about doing, removing one or two triangles and moving them down so that they don't "explode". Now the concept is leaning more towards that the student is the jewel in the project with the "M" as the mentor supporting it. Which I think works better then the exploding/evolving concept. Also I'm hoping this will reduce the fries problem.

As for the colors I have a color scheme which I have to follow. The orange and dark purple are two of the colors. Might adjust the gradient some still.

Will post more updates soon, thanks for the feedback so far.

nice one. sorry to chime in so late, good work.

glad you didn't go with the initial concept ... it was WAY too corporate and the wrong feel.

the latest presentation is definitely a step in the right direction!

		<div class="commentbody">thanks, I wanted to work on it some more to improve the diamond shape but I only have 80 hours to put into this project. 

I've done the logo, webpage plus CSS/HTML for the site. 

Now I only have 8 hours left and that will be spent fixing bugs on the site.</div>
