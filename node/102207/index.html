  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The unicode codecharts specifically state that the sample glyphs shown are not intended to be normative, but I&rsquo;m wondering how much leeway is actually intended. I&rsquo;m specifically interested in symbol/picture characters rather than characters from actual scripts.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, both Linotype Astrology Pi No. 1 and Linotype Astrology Pi No. 2 include glyphs in the range U+2648 through U+2653 (i.e. zodiacal symbols). The glyphs in LAP#1 closely match the symbolic representations shown in the standard whereas those in LAP#2 contain pictorial representations of these signs which bear no resemblance to the glyphs shown in the standard. This seems legitimate, though, since each set of glyphs match the <em>descriptions</em> given in the standard (aries, taurus, etc.)</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m wondering about cases where the description given in the standard describes an actual <em>shape</em>.</p>
<p>For example, in the standard U+26E8 is described as BLACK CROSS ON SHIELD (=hospital). Would it be inappropriate to encode a glyph in this slot such as the hospital glyph from Adobe Carta (encoded in the private use area at U+E02D) despite the fact that it is actually a white cross on a black circle?</p>
<p>Note that the above is just an example. I&rsquo;m just trying to get a feel for whether the graphic description takes priority or whether a graphic or semantic match is sufficient (or near-match for that matter - with pictorial symbols in some cases the semantics are a bit fuzzy).</p>
<p>n.b. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Adobe Carta was released before this codepoint had been defined, so their decision to use a PUA codepoint is not revealing of their take on the matter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Generally speaking, this has to be determined by criteria external to the Unicode Standard. Such criteria have to take into account user expectations, and must reflect the degree to which a certain shape is normative in a particular usage. The zodiac symbols are a good example, because users employ both symbolic and graphical representations; hence the Linotype Astrology font approach makes good sense in supporting both usages.</p>
<p>Where a Unicode character name does specify something like particular colour arrangement &ndash; e.g. black on white &ndash; then that can usually be expected to form user expectation, such that someone may legitimately complain if this character is represented in white on black. If U+26E8 were simply named CROSS ON SHIELD, then I think reversing the colours would be legitimate and while some users might not like it they would have no grounds to complain.</p>
<p>Note that some mathematical symbols in Unicode have recognised variant forms that are meant to be displayable using Variation Selector code. This is supported in OpenType using a format 14 cmap table, which maps combinations of character code and VS codes to glyph variants.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the reply. Your position on U+26E8 makes sense.</p>
<p>More generally, what I&rsquo;m trying to decide is, when encoding a pi font, whether it&rsquo;s better to assign non-PUA unicode values to symbols only when an exact match can be found, or whether a &lsquo;close&rsquo; match is sufficient.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d prefer to avoid PUA codepoints where a more appropriate assignment exists. The big problem here, though, is figuring out exactly what constitutes a close match. The standard doesn&rsquo;t always specify why certain symbols were encoded in the first place, which makes it difficult to figure out whether a precise shape might be expected in some technical contexts.</p>

These are 2 examples of how to find documents specifying the “whys” of encoding (the <code>nDDDD</code> ones).  The first page was found via going to Scripts/Cyrillic/search-for-Unicode Status; the second one can be reached via Scripts/Latin.  I cannot find “Unicode Status” for “Miscellaneous symbols” though…  Maybe googling for <code>site:scriptsource.org &ldquo;unicode status&rdquo; &ldquo;miscellaneous symbols&rdquo;</code> (or some such) may help you…</p>

<p>The ScriptSource community have been adding Unicode Status pages for various scripts just because the background information for characters is, as you&rsquo;ve found, difficult to find.  I&rsquo;m glad you have found the info helpful, but please understand that this is a work-in-progress &ndash; and we invite anyone with relevant knowledge to contribute to the project.</p>
<p>I would point out that for characters that have been in Unicode for a long time documentation is both harder to find and, in a practical sense, generally less important to developers. For that reason ScriptSource contributors have focused on characters added more recently.</p>
<p>Case in pont: the zodiac characters you mention (U+2648, U+2653) are very old &ndash; dating back to Unicode 1.1.</p>
