  for some wacky font variations from Dr B\xF6ger Photosatz GmbH. I'm pretty sure
  there was Souvenir with a variety of outlines, inlines and drop shadows. And Helvetica
  in rounded, outline, shadowed and maybe chiseled. I even had Marvin Kommel set set
  some logos for me in those fonts.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone remember them? Are there any
  showings on the Web and have any of those fonts been digitized?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNos"

    where I found the correct spelling of the firm's name. Thanks.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping
    to find some information about the unique fonts that they sold. If they weren't
    unique, at least I never saw them elsewhere."
