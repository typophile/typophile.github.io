<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everyone.
ok, so im still trying to focus my effort in typography.
i have 2 questions hope you can help me with.
1.about le corbusier's modular measures, how is it applied to typography? only for the grid? (maybe i can figure it out if someone gives me a link. although im fixing up my math intelligence which sucks right now)
2.is the same modular applied on type sizes in a publication? how is it done? or again where i can learn about this? like having a certain proportional difference between all the hierarichal sizes in a publication?
thanks a mill.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>ok so no one seems like could help... (like my native language isnt english) hmm i will try re stating the question?
how can we decide on the type font sizes within a publication? like i know i will have 4 different sizes from body to big title, does it matter that there is a proportional jump between them?
thanks.

<div class=commentbody>I see no reason why Le Corbusier's Modulor could not be applied to a typographic scaling system. It is, is it not, related to the Golden ratio? I know it's more specific than that, but it might be best to consider your typographic system in isolation from factors like the height of the average man &c.... factors that might be irrelevant.
First, find your ideal body size (which will be different for each typeface and application) you then find the equivalent sizes for your other faces, and multiply the results by some factor of the G.R..
For example, I start at the point where your body type and, say, your companion sans are equal in x-height, and then work from there. In some cases they will be almost equal from the start (for example Matthew Carter's ITC Charter is almost exactly the same size and proportions as Process' Seravek), but some faces which otherwise share a similar set of proportions (for example OurType's Eva and Adobe Garamond Premier Pro in the caption size) will turn out, as I'm sure you know, to be perversely unequal in numerical value, eg 9.5 of font A = 8.9 of font B.
So let's say that your base body size is 9.5. For a simple table you'd go (NB I'm rounding):
9.5 x 1.618 = 15.4
15.4 x 1.618 = 24.9
24.9 x 1.618 = 40.2
40.2 x 1.618 = 65.1
this process can go the other way:
9.5 / 1.618 = 5.8
5.8 / 1.618 = 3.6
3.6 / 1.618 = 2.2
But for editorial type these steps are way too big to be useful, so to pick another number that produces steps that are small enough, use the a root of your number. If I was to use a square root my values would cycle back to my original scale in only two steps:
2 {root} 1.618 = 1.272
9.5 x 1.272 = 12.1
12.1 x 1.272 = 15.4
15.4 x 1.272 = 19.5
19.5 x 1.272 = 24.9
But if you choose a root of a higher power, you can have more steps:
4 {root} 1.618 = 1.1278
gives you four steps:
9.5 x 1.1278 = 10.7
10.7 x 1.1278 = 12.1
12.1 x 1.1278 = 13.6
13.6 x 1.1278 = 15.4
There's a good calculator for this at:
http://www.wiris.com/demo/en/
And you can use a number of different roots that fit together, so a 1 {root}, 2 {root}, and 3 {root} set would have a collective cycle that would be in unison in six steps (as the smallest common factor of 2 and 3 is 6).
Once you have your multiplier (say 1.1278) then you can build out your tables of type-size equivalents as far as you wish. You can, if you're doing a large number of values, plug it into an Excel spreadsheet (just create a chain of functions between cells).
For leading I think it's better to think of it like Lego bricks, so I just take my base value and divide it as needs be, eg:
12/6 = 2
2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14 etc.
You might be able to employ more sophisticated math on your grid, but it might make things very complicated.
I hope this is of some help.</div>
