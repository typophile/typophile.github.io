body: "Hey all, this is a question of taste. There's no one answer I'm looking for,
  just advice from those more versed than I.\r\n\r\nI'm designing a site which will
  @font-face embed Museo for use as body copy.\r\n\r\nThe site is used for display
  of statistics and information, tastefully laid out on a grid. A few tabular structures.
  Nothing with long runs of body copy, and Museo performs beautifully at the task.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am seeking is a reccomendation for a display face to be used sparingly in some
  prominent locations. Some considerations:\r\n\r\n* Some of these locations are large
  and numeric, so pretty numerals are important.\r\n* Obviously, limited to faces
  which are either widely-installed (separate faces for Win/Mac ok) or legally @font-faceable.\r\n\r\nI've
  been having trouble settling on one. Thus far I've liked:\r\n\r\n* Museo Sans--usually
  only when set in uppercase\r\n* Helvetica-alikes.\r\n* League of Movable Type's
  (LMT?) [[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk|ChunkFive]]. I like
  it more for just the numerals.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations? What face would you use
  to set off Museo nicely?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nIdan"
