  Some might be professionally printed, with a bleed. Some might be printed manually
  on normal, desktop inkjets, and so they will not need a bleed.\r\n\r\nIs there a
  practical way to scale a document that I've created in InDesign so that it prints
  on a normal printer within its standard margins? \r\n\r\nI don't think it's practical
  to redesign every piece for two purposes, there are too many. Can I convert the
  fonts to outline in InDesign and scale the whole thing as a group, so that it will
  print on the inkjets? (I would, in this case, create a background under all the
  other elements at the final size necessary).\r\n\r\nOr export the bleed-version
  as a PDF, and scale it down 95% or so in Photoshop and re-save it?\r\n\r\nI'm not
  so concerned with a difference between the elements and their closeness to the edge
  between versions, just that everything looks good & crisp."

    And while exporting the PDF go to Mark and Bleed options and enable crop and bleed
    marks.\r\n\r\nSo, when you print the document with manual settings you will automatically
    get bleeding margins on all the sides, which you can cut & implement later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nNitinGarg,

  body: "Which version of Indesign? CS4 allows positioning of InDesign documents within
    InDesign. So if I get you right, you could make one \"container\" document with
    a frame that respects the printer margins, & position your original document inside
    that, like you would an image, scaled to 95% or whatever. Then export new PDF,
    voil\xE0.\r\n\r\nThat, or select everything, group, and scale while holding down
    the Shift and Apple keys (dunno how that works on Windows \u2013 probably with
    Ctrl?). That even scales down type, too."

  body: "NitinGarg. I'm not sure if that answers me because--well i know how to print
    with bleeds and get that cut. But one version will not have bleeds and will not
    be cut...\r\n\r\nAltaira,\r\n\r\nWell, damn, its CS3 on Windows. That second option
    sounds like it would be perfect! At first try it wasn't working, with everything
    selected. I then found that when you group all the items and hold shift+control
    that does indeed work.\r\n\r\nI was hoping i could get it to scale from the middle,
    centered...holding alt doesn't accomplish that. Oh well, i guess! Thank you!\r\n\r\nBut
    if I am understanding correctly, InDesign can scale everything by itself (using
    the scale box near the upper left). This does seem to scale things to the center,
    and does preserve the text as editable.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to use one
    of these options over the other, aside from scaling from the center? Or is this
    just a case where two roads lead to the same destination?"

    options over the other\"</cite>\r\nI'd assume it's just two ways to do the same
    thing, depending on if you want to do it visually, or via inputing exact target
    values. \r\nI guess you could also group everything and then do an Object &gt;
    Transform &gt; Scale and go via percent values. That seems to scale the type too."

  body: "@evanbrog:\r\n\r\nSetup and finish the version with bleeds and print the
    final design to PDF with marks and bleeds. Open a copy of that PDF in Acrobat
    Pro and select 'Crop Pages' from the 'Document' menu. Select the option to show
    the 'trimbox'. This will automatically set the margins in cropping area. Click
    OK to crop.\r\n\r\nWith the PDF now cropped to the trim size you can print from
    Acrobat with 'Page Scaling' set to 'Fit the Printable Area'. Any scaling that
    is required will be handled automatically."
