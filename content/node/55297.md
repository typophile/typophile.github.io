  body: "It is <em>probably</em> okay, but not officially recommended. I'm not aware
    of any situation in which it would break, but that doesn't mean that there isn't
    some piece of software out there with an in-built assumption that all font names
    contain only A-Z and a-z.\r\n\r\nWe took the risk many years ago, including numerals
    in a font name (Garamond 1530) and didn't run into any problems, but I noticed
    that even fairly recently when Adobe were experimenting with naming optical masters
    by explicit size they spelled out the numbers, e.g. 'ten' instead of '10'.\r\n\r\nOnce,
    when mastering a large set of fonts for a client, I came across # in a font name,
    and my recommendation to the client was that we should get rid of this. One simply
    doesn't know what problems a character like # or & might cause.\r\n\r\nSo I'm
    not necessarily saying that you should play it safe, but if you wanted to play
    it safe, you would avoid &."

  body: "It's a bad idea. In Windows, application menu captions are written in a way
    that ampersands precedes the letter that gets the menu keyboard shortcut assigned.
    So if the source code of the application says \"&Open\" and \"S&ave as...\", the
    menu will have \"O\" in <em>O</em>pen and \"a\" in \"S<em>a</em>ve as\" underlined,
    and those letters will work as keyboard shortcuts. \r\n\r\nDepending on how cleanly
    a programmer has written the code, it may happen that the same is applied to font
    names displayed in the menu. So if you name your font \"Black&White\", the user
    may actually see \"Black<em>W</em>hite\" with \"W\" underlined, which will obviously
    be nonsense. "

  body: Definitely avoid unless there is a *VERY* compelling reason to use it and/or
    you enjoy doing tech support. All punctuation and non-ASCII alphabetics should
    be avoided, really, as many of them are reserved or have special meaning in different
    contexts (i.e. '/', '\' in filesystems, '&', '<', '>', ';' and others in HTML,
    etc.).

    The sorts of reserved uses that Adam described for Windows menus can also apply
    to other areas of programming. Operating systems might handle them, but I\u2019ve
    run into software that was not coded to anticipate filenames with special characters
    or spaces and starts misbehaving. It gets especially bad once the files end up
    on a CD/DVD, where the mastering software may not be capable of dealing with nonstandard
    filenames but will burn something to disc anyway, without ever raising an error."

  body: "I just wanted to reiterate not to use & in the font name, meaning the file
    names, postscript name and whatever name will be seen by the system. Such special
    characters in Linux often make life more difficult on the command line. The ampersand,
    for instance, stops the command at that character, and puts whatever was called
    into the background. One can always remedy this by writing \\& for &, but it always
    is frustrating to have to go through long internet addresses and pick out the
    special characters, for example. \r\nAlso, in Xe(La)TeX one has to declare the
    font in the document using the full name installed on the machine. An ampersand
    here would be seen as a misplaced alignment character, and I would just have to
    hope that \\& would remedy it. "
