body: "I'm desperately looking for an alternative to this (f)ugly face. The idea was
  something that could work with Meta (body copy), yet in a completely human, quirky,
  silly way. I dont want it to be overdone to the point where it starts conflicting
  with other elements on the page. Please help anyone. Thanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=122\r\n"

  body: Oops sorry. Its for a corporate identity. But the "quirky" face is only going
    to be used for powerpoint presentations (to explain to clients in a softer, looser
    tone). And also used very minimally as callouts or quotes perhaps  2-3 sentences
    etc.

  body: I should probably stop beating the House Industries drum, but they've got
    a ton of gorgeous quirky fonts, one of them has to be perfect for this sort of
    thing.

  body: "FF Hands- too funky.\r\nI second Linotype Feltip. Its neutral but it has
    personality. Ropsen is also close.\r\nLindsay Pro is well done however it may
    be too high contrast. It's probably hinted though.\r\nMarydale, Bradley Hand,
    Lucida Casual, and even Chalkboard.\r\n\r\nThere are zillons of casual scripts
    out there... the tough part is finding the right one. \r\n\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
