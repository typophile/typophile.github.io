  family is now available through Myfonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ryancorey/occidental/\r\n\r\nThe
  Occidental family is a geometric, sans-serif text face marked by its angular construction.\r\n\r\nOccidental
  is suitable and economical enough to set large blocks of copy, but at display sizes
  Occidental\u2019s inherent character takes over making it useful for headline setting
  as well.\r\n\r\nThe family includes four weights, each with corresponding italics
  (excepting Display) for a total of seven fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/25625_5531.png]"

  body: "Congratulations on the release, Ryan. This is an interesting mix of curves
    and straights. \r\n\r\nNot to pigeonhole the typeface, but I could see it finding
    an audience with hip design firms and cultural organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
