  family print license. I'd like one with quite a spread-out, relaxed feel, maybe
  sort of a sans-serif version of Garamond, with quite a low x-height but something
  you can still reasonably use for printed body text in the 12-14 pt range. It would
  be very good if for maths typesetting use it had both small caps and a basic Greek
  character set (just what you need to set maths terms like \u03C3x\u0305), but I
  don't think I need text figures. TheSans, FF Quadraat and FF Kievit are close to
  what I want but I'd prefer something with a lower x-height and a bit less condensed
  than TheSans."
