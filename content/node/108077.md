  body: 'Yes. I would highly recommend reading through, [[http://kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf|Karsten
    Luecke''s guide to font metrics]] (fair warning, depending on your browser, that
    link will trigger an automatic download of a PDF). There are also numerous discussions
    elsewhere on Typophile, but the one about [[UPM and vertical font metrics: please
    help to clarify|UPM and Vertical Font Metrics]] should have the level of detail
    you need and cover most questions.'
