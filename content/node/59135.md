body: "Hello, I realize that this is my first post here ever, and it's basically just
  a link to my blog, but I am by no means just fishing for hits or trying to gain
  some popularity. The simple fact of the matter is I don't do a whole lot with exotic
  fonts, but I happened to fall into this situation, and thought others should be
  aware. Some (most) of you may feel LHF is in the right here, but I really can't
  get around how unwilling they are to provide access to something I have proof I
  paid for.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is I bought a font from Letterhead several years
  ago, before they maintained a user database that allows you to download purchased
  fonts whenever you need them. I lost the original download, and after contacting
  them to regain access to the font (a process they have described on their support
  page, specifically for orders placed before their user database was in place), they
  maintain that their policy is to only grant access to these \"legacy\" purchases
  if the customer purchases a new font. According to them, this is to compensate them
  for the time required (\"about 20 minutes\", to quote a rep) to grant my new account
  access to the font. I have provided them both the original receipt and the credit
  card statement showing the purchase but they are persistent about the 20 minutes
  of customer service being equivalent in value to an entire typeface. They also closed
  my account for saying I wouldn't be paying for a new font.\r\n\r\nGranted they are
  only looking for $35 or $40, but since I only need the one font that I have already
  purchased, that would be doubling the cost of the original product. Not to mention
  I don't specifically need another font, and I have very little (read: zero) money
  to simply through around at the moment.\r\n\r\nLike I said, maybe I'm wrong here,
  but this whole thing really just smells like them trying to score one extra sale.
  I just can't comprehend how something that's probably four or five clicks of the
  mouse could demand $35, when that is the cost of their product.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I
  generally liked LHF before this happened, but this experience has left a bad taste
  in my mouth. Here's the whole story:\r\nhttp://www.awholenother.com/2009/06/17/letterhead-fonts-bad-business/"

  body: This is really not a good example of customer service. At all. The squeaky
    wheel gets the grease, so to speak, I hope you get the help you deserve.

  body: "LHF seems to have a bit of a reputation around here for not necessarily being
    customer friendly. I doubt I'd ever purchase a face from them.\r\n\r\nGranted,
    I had the same runaround with Adobe as well (regarding Macromedia licenses)--though
    I kind of expect that kind of bad service from a behemoth like Adobe."

    all the best getting it sorted.

  body: "EK, legally I don't know for sure. It certainly would seem like I'm within
    my usage rights, as I have a license. I know they have a verbiage on their website
    that says their fonts are all visibly and invisibly digitally signed, and they
    can all be traced. I've also heard that they don't distribute actual font files
    anymore, but rather an application that loads the font into the operating system
    during boot, but that's not confirmed, and maybe not uncommon (like I said, I
    stick to pretty standard fonts being a web dev, not buying too many these days).\r\n\r\nAs
    far as my opinion, I wouldn't be losing any sleep if I happened to find the font
    elsewhere :)"

    LHF if you are just looking for something in that style. Dafont just happened
    to be the first google result:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/ballpark-weiner.font\r\n"

  body: sorry to revive this thread, but I'm wondering if anyone knows where LHF is
    located, or has any contact information outside of the normal support form? I've
    tried several more times to make some headway in this whole thing, and haven't
    received any more replies, so clearly I'm just being ignored. I would like to
    try and at least contact the BBB or something, but for some reason I feel like
    LHF isn't a US company.

  body: so not sure if anyone really cares about this, but I submitted my complaint
    to the Reno BBB. I received confirmation that they are sending LHF a complaint
    on my behalf, and LHF has two weeks to respond before..something happens. Not
    really sure what, but at least they're looking into it.
