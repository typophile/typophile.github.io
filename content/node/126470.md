  version of MS Font Validator which is now in open development. I am perplexed by
  Github and the arcane file lists there. I tried to download a binary and McAfee
  immediately flagged the downloaded file as containing a virus, then deleted it.\r\n\r\nWould
  someone kindly point me to a recent version of Font Validator ready to be installed
  on Windows 7, hopefully an .msi or .exe file.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCharax\r\n"

    yet you have to give really well ordered guidelines with the goal that the normal
    Mac client who has never set a way factor in their life will have the capacity
    to tail it. Presumably a large portion of the potential group of onlookers for
    this apparatus doesn't know how.\r\nI for one just prepend the order with the
    variable, I.e. Doing: \r\n\r\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<someplace>/Darwin <someplace>/FontValidator
    \r\n\r\nRather than \r\n\r\n<someplace>/FontValidator \r\n\r\nWhere \"<someplace>\"
    is the unloaded organizer some place under/Users/Hintak or Desktop . \r\n\r\nThere
    are more diligent methods for doing this (\"fare ...\" per session or altering
    .bashrc - perpetual) yet I won't go into points of interest. Simply prepending
    is sufficiently simple.\r\nFurther details visit <a href=\"https://sovinco.com/\">sovinco</a>\r\n"

  body: "Hello, I was searching for some other Font Validator related thing and came
    to this... I would like to know which urls you click got McAfee to delete.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    this is probably what I would recommend people to download to use now:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/hp-pxl-jetready/files/Microsoft%20Font%20Validator/misc/FontVal-2.1.0-py-bin-net4-x86.zip/download\r\n\r\nYou
    just unzip somewhere and double-click  FontVal.exe within. Unlike the older version,
    it doesn't write anything to registry, etc so you can have multiple versions around,
    and does not really need to be packaged into an installer. Just unzip somewhere
    and run.\r\n\r\nMostly I try to get people to post in public (the freedesktop
    create mailing list or the freetype-devel mailing list, typedrawers web site,
    or file a issue on github in either Microsoft's issue tracker or mine) so that
    others can benefit instead of one-to-one e-mails, but if you have to e-mail me,
    you have to ... htl10 at users.sourceforge.net is the e-mail address.\r\n(yes,
    I am the main person reviving the Font Val code...)\r\n"
