body: "Here's some samples of a new pointed brush font I've been working on. It's
  being drawn on the wrong side of Epson photo paper with a Japanese Pentel brush
  pen and of course redrawn (I do ok with a brush but I'm not that good yet) and edited
  in Illustrator to create the connections. I've redrawn the upper and lowercase about
  5 times now to get to where I'm at. I'm unsure about the L, k, s and z and I'd like
  some opinions on what everyone thinks about the direction it's going.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pointed_brush_5275.gif]"

  body: i think it's quite nice! the lowercase seems a bit too tight in places, esp
    the right side of the o, but in many other places as well. i think the lettershaps
    you're questioning are just fine, but i found the u a bit ambiguous i stopped
    reading when i came to it because i couldn't decide if it was a u or an en. The
    S seems wonky, something just not quite right about it. overall it feels very
    nice though, keep up the good work!

  body: I like it... a very nice flow to the lettering... would be nice to have some
    alternates for when there are double letters, to make it look less 'digital'...
    however, if i could write like that, i'd probably not bother with digital :-)

  body: Not bad, Jess!  Paul is right about spacing. The 's' is just fine, just needs
    more room. Especially apparent in the 'ss' pair.

    :(

  body: But the 's' doesn't connect on the right side, and doesn't need to. "Jackson"
    looks fine, for instance, and will still with a little more space after the 's'.

  body: "> <em>The S seems wonky, something just not quite right about it.</em>\r\n\r\nCould
    that be because of the very thin spine?\r\n\r\nI understand that the tool dictates
    the shapes in this case, but maybe if the weight would be on the spine a bit more,
    it might look better.\r\nI think most writing tools put the weight on the 'ears'
    of the S (because of the angle), so to speak, and that historically speaking,
    the weight was shifted to the spine, to balance the shape. Or am I mistaken?"

    loosened up spacing and also the reworked S and u. I also reshaped the s and made
    a few other minor changes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pointed_brush_2_4543.gif]\r\n\r\nJess

  body: this is really terrific. i especially enjoy the "y" and "g," and i'm usually
    a bit uneasy with the "x" in connecting scripts, but yours works well. i know
    you'll continue to noodle with it for a bit yet, but great job so far.

  body: much better already! the dl combo seems a bit tight still, it could actually
    be the left side of the l that's doing it. also the right side of the s seems
    a bit tight still.

  body: "I like this very much. It has a nice loose flow, but still looks a bit tight
    - you could easily make the lead-outs a bit longer to get more inter-character
    space. For a more authentic handwritten look you could also introduce many two
    or three character ligatures in OpenType, (especially duplicate characters together),
    and also have some replacement end characters without the long lead-out stroke.\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "Thanks Chuck, Paul and Nick! : )\r\n\r\nI'm having a spacing dilemma. Everything
    looks ok to me except the double s combination. Would it be a bad idea to use
    kerning to move them away from each other instead of how a kern normally works?
    Here's an example of how that looks with the double s kern:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pointed_again_5289.gif]\r\n\r\nJess

  body: jess, the ss looks better to me, but even the sh looks tight to me. the s
    could probably use a bit more air to the right. (or it could be the h that's problem,
    but i'm guessing the s)

  body: "This is a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nAt small sizes the exit stroke on the s (the
    little half loop) is a little flat. Or maybe I should say it is sharp. And the
    terminus on the e seems flat, perhaps the t as well. I assume you're working on
    alternates?\r\n\r\nThis is fun. (I know I said that already but I couldn't help
    writing it again.)"

    talking about the pair.

  body: I'm new to this thread but the face is beautiful and your work on the kern
    pairs really perfected it. This is a look that's needed right now. It's a med-heavy
    script but smooth and easy on the eyes. And it's always fun to find alternates
    in a typeface, shows craftmanship. Very nice work.
