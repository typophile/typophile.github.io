    certain people have no qualms about trying to bring down an entire channel of

    who make enough money to call type design their sole profession.&#34; <BR> <BR>Hrant:
    <BR>&#34;&#34;From what I know, about half of those 20 people seem to live too
    modestly for my tastes, so for me the list is actually around 10&#34;&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#34;However, I no longer think 20 is too high. But 300 is completely
    lala-land.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&#34;If I wanted to scour the rest of the
    UK I&#39;m sure I could easily get up to 20 or 25.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&#34;I
    stand by my previous assertions that there are &#34;way more&#34; people than
    20&#34; <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR>&#34;It is a market that is  <BR>in a very sad state,
    whether there are 20 or 200  <BR>full-time designers.&#34; <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#34;20
    is an order of magnitude closer to the truth than 600.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Refences
    to 600: <BR>Hrant as above. <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&#34;The 3-400 is probably comprised
    of 600 or so actual bodies who drift in and out over time or as they are completing
    other projects.&#34; <BR> <BR>Erik Spiekermann: <BR>And Clive is totall right
    with his estimate of maybe 600 people making a living out of font sales worldwide.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>So, Hrant says, latterly, that there are &#42;not&#42; way less
    than 20, but says he was right anyway. <BR> <BR>No one says anywhere in this thread
    that there are &#34;600 type designers&#34; &#34;making a living&#34;. Therefore
    Hrant&#39;s use of that figure as being incorrect would appear to have a high
    bogosity factor: <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#34;20 is an order of magnitude closer to
    the truth than 600&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>References to 300: <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&#34;I&#39;d
    say that the type business supports around 3-400 people world wide on a full time
    basis, excluding those working in retail sales which probably comes to around
    another couple of hundred.&#34; <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#34;BTW, forget thousands:
    if it is/were even close to 300, I&#39;d be happy.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clive: <BR>&#34;However
    they choose to go with the flow of work as it comes and goes. I do believe that
    there is enough work to keep 300&#43; people working full time, but as i wrote
    before, that&#39;s a subset of a group that&#39;s quite a bit larger.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#34;But 300 is completely lala-land.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Conclusion:
    Clive seems non-specific if these 300 are &#34;type designers&#34;, so difficult
    to argue that his figure is wrong, though Erik&#39;s post indicates having read
    this and chooses not to counter it - in fact agreeing with the wider 600 figure.
    <BR> <BR>Given that many people have given numbers far inexcess of 20, or around
    20 for just 1 little country &#40;how can there be that many just in England and
    not a &#34;magnitude&#34; greater than that worldwide!?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hrant still
    insists there are ~20. <BR> <BR>I think I would tend to side with someone like
    Erik Spiekermann, who clearly has a better understanding than most - being a type
    designer himself and having run a large foundry/reseller. <BR> <BR>So, there are
    the tatters: your point seems to be proved wrong at worst and rhetoric at best. '

    Hrant: <BR>&#62; &#34;&#34;From what I know, about half of those 20 people seem
    to live too modestly for my tastes, so for me the list is actually around 10&#34;&#34;
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s totally out of context, and you know it. <BR> <BR>---- <BR>
    <BR>It seems that you want to see things as absolute wrong/right, and for me that&#39;s
    self-destructive: it&#39;s all about &#42;learning&#42;. <BR> <BR>&#62; Hrant
    still insists there are ~20. <BR> <BR>Wrong. <BR> <BR>Less than three hours ago
    I wrote: <BR>&#34;20 is an order of magnitude closer to the truth than 600&#34;.
    If you need help understanding what that means, ask, or look up some words. <BR>
    <BR>Yes, I &#42;was&#42; wrong back when I wrote that there are &#34;way less
    than 20&#34;. I&#39;m willing &#40;and possibly unlike you &#42;able&#42;&#41;
    to learn, and I&#39;ve found that going out on a limb is a great strategy in this
    respect &#40;because too often people who have valuable information will only
    reveal it in some form of self-defense&#41;, as long as you can take the occasional
    slip &#40;which I can&#41;. The problem is that some people here are not interested
    in learning, just yelling. <BR> <BR>If we must focus on 20/600, I can safely say:
    <BR>I was much less wrong than &#42;you&#42; still are now! <BR> <BR>&#62; I think
    I would tend to side with someone like Erik Spiekermann <BR> <BR>I learned a lot
    from Spiekermann&#39;s post. And actually much of what he wrote &#40;not the little
    snippets you wasted your time compiling, like some hapless lawyer, but the &#42;good&#42;
    stuff which is &#42;always&#42; between in lines&#41; gave me more confidence
    that 600 was way off &#40;again, remember: using my definition&#41;. I side with
    nobody, except what makes &#42;sense&#42;; no single person is omniscient, and
    certainly not 100% objective. If you could be just over 50% objective, you might
    get my point. But I think it might be too late for you. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    300 is really not hugely more accurate than 600; a factor of two - big deal. <BR>

    measured in terms of difference, or proportion? Let&#39;s just use both: <BR>
    <BR>1. Difference: <BR>&#40;x - 20&#41; = &#40;1 / 10&#41; &#42; &#40;600 - x&#41;
    <BR>x - 20 = 60 - &#40;x / 10&#41; <BR>11/10 &#42; x = 80 <BR>x = 800 / 11 = ~73
    <BR> <BR>2. Proportion: <BR>&#40;x / 20&#41; = &#40;1 / 10&#41; &#42; &#40;600
    / x&#41; <BR>x / 20 = 60 / x <BR>x^2 = 1200 <BR>x = ~35 <BR> <BR>Giving the two
    equal weight, the answer is ~54! Yippee...  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#42; But really, Tiffany&#39;s
    evaluation is increasingly true: this horse, who had such a tumultuous, eventful
    life, is now verily dead. So what are we now but bestial necrophiliacs? Sweet

    some not so. Erik Spiekermann&#39;s comments were obviously the most informed.
    Just my 2 cents, I think it about as likely to make a decent living these days
    from type design as it is from graphic design in general. The true &#34;democritization&#34;
    of design has happened, i.e., everyone with a computer is a designer. This subject
    has been touched upon by some in other venues. There can&#39;t be more than a
    very small number, 600 ? someone said, perhaps Erik, worldwide who make a living
    designing type fonts. But, I still do this stuff when I can and enjoy it.  <BR>Jordan '
