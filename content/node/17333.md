  \r\n\r\n\r\nSergey's release notes... \r\n\r\n<STRONG>Microsoft VOLT 1.2.236 release
  notes</STRONG>\r\n\r\nNew VOLT release includes several important new features:\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Context
  exclusion syntax for contextual lookups.</STRONG>\r\n\r\nThis is the new way of
  using contexts in VOLT lookups, allowing font developer to do things that were not
  possible before and to implement lookups more efficiently. Inside the lookup user
  can use 'EXCEPT' contexts and substitution or positioning will happen only if input
  does not match excluded context. To do this, you simply type 'EXCEPT' word (case
  sensitive) in the beginning of context you want to exclude. You can use both normal
  and 'EXCEPT' context in one lookup. The only restriction is to put all 'EXCEPT'
  contexts before normal ones.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Here are few simple examples of how
  context exceptions can be used:</STRONG>\r\n\r\nFirst, in this example we\u2019ll
  substitute letters with special forms at the end of the words. Normally, you can't
  do this or can do with very unintuitive.\r\n\r\n&lt;Letters&gt; -&gt; &lt;EndOfWordForms&gt;
  \r\nIn context: \r\nEXCEPT  | &lt;Letters&gt; \r\n\r\nThe second example mixes normal
  and except contexts, making code more readable. Before, you would need at least
  two lookups to do this and this would cause unnecessary substitutions.\r\n\r\nA
  -&gt; A.1 \r\nIn context: \r\nEXCEPT | x y                   \r\n  | x \r\n\r\n<STRONG>Export
  and import for multiple lookups and multiple groups</STRONG>\r\n\r\nYou can now
  select multiple lookups and export them into single file. Same can be done with
  groups. \r\n\r\nThis change required slight changes in export file syntax. This
  is important if you have lookups or groups exported from older version and want
  to use them in the new VOLT. \r\n\r\nEven if you have one lookup in the file, it
  should be appended with the 'END' keyword at the very end. (You can use your favorite
  text editor for that). Please note: if you import lookup from new VOLT into older
  version, only the first lookup will be imported.\r\n\r\nIf you have a positioning
  lookup that uses anchors, 'END_POSITION' keyword should be moved before all anchors
  in the file. And, of course, do not forget the 'END'.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Main window
  improvements</STRONG>\r\n\r\nYou can now select and drag multiple lookups from lookup
  list into feature tree. You can delete several lookups as well.\r\n\r\nFeature tree
  is not refreshing and expanding after every change anymore. Also, if you select
  a feature node in the tree, lookup list will automatically select all lookups associated
  with this feature \u2013 a convenient way to check if some lookup is missing from
  the feature.\r\n\r\nUsers may re-import cmap table from the font at any time. It
  is useful when font had been modified outside VOLT with some other tools. You just
  should not forget to do this first thing after you opened font in VOLT - otherwise
  cmap will be overwritten by data stored in the VOLT project.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Proofing
  tool improved experience</STRONG>\r\n\r\nNow, when you close the proofing tool window
  and open it again it restores all parameters that you used to test your font \u2013
  input glyphs, script and language system, features applied. \r\n\r\nAlso, debugging
  your lookups is made easier. Instead of using lookup navigation buttons, you can
  just use combobox above it and jump directly to the lookup you are interested in.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Glyph
  properties window improvements</STRONG>\r\n\r\nCharacter codes for surrogates can
  be entered as scalar values instead of surrogate pairs. Surrogate pair format is
  still recognized but immediately converted into scalar value. Please note that because
  of that change older versions of VOLT will not understand fonts saved from this
  new version, but only if surrogate characters are used in the project.\r\n\r\nSearch
  box had been added to glyph editor \u2013 at the very top, above glyph properties
  text box with Find button. Button is the same as it used to be, but when you type
  into the box VOLT will dynamically search for and select first glyph that has specified
  prefix. Also, if you type U+xxxx it will search for the glyph which has this character
  mapped to it, e.g. U+61 or U+0061 will select Small Latin \u2018a\u2019.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Positioning
  lookup editing</STRONG>\r\n\r\nNew, convenient model to restrict anchor movement
  added to positioning window. When dragging an anchor with the mouse you can press
  Shift key to allow anchor only move horizontally, and press Control key for vertical-only
  movement. If you press Control/Shift in the middle of the dragging it will have
  the same effect as if it was pressed from the very beginning - anchor will jump
  onto the original vertical or horizontal position.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Compilation options</STRONG>\r\n\r\nYou
  may now control compilation by instructing VOLT to use extension lookups or choose
  to use format 2 for pair positioning lookups (by default, format 1 is used). These
  options are saved in the project and used every time project is compiled. Use this
  option only when it is needed \u2013 when size of the tables in the font becomes
  too big to fit your lookups.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Various bug fixes</STRONG>\r\n\r\nMultiple
  minor and not so minor bugs fixed in VOLT.\r\n\r\n<STRONG>Supplemental files updated</STRONG>\r\n\r\nSupplemental
  files are updated. New Uniscribe is taken from a recent Windows Vista build, integrating
  the latest changes to script shaping engines. Mangal font is also latest Vista version.
  It is renamed to \"Mangal Sample\" and has hints stripped out.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Simon,\r\nThnx for the announcement. I got the latest VOLT, but there
    seems to be a bug in the installation process (using XP here). When installing
    it points out at least 3 version conflicts, claims that my existing files r more
    recent, and recommends that I keep my existing files. When I got to the supplemental
    files I realized something was wrong and, sure enough, the supplemental files
    contained in the latest VOLT are newer, though the installation claims the opposite.
    If I followed the install advice I would not have got the new supplements.\r\n\r\nNow
    I do not know if I was supposed to update the dll's that the install claimed were
    \"older\". Any advice?\r\n\r\nBest\r\nI"

    to the better technology for this release but did not have time for that, so this
    will be left for the next update.\r\n\r\nFor this version you can do follwoing:\r\n\r\n1.
    Uninstall all previous versions of VOLT.\r\n2. When installing this update, keep
    files with higher version number in Windows\\System32 folder.\r\n3. (If you did
    not unistall VOLT as I recommended in item 1,) overwrite any file in VOLT installation
    folder.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
