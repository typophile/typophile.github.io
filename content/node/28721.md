  logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_odeon_6572.gif]\r\n\r\nand the
  1930s Paramount vertical logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/odeon_gal14_300x225_4751.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny

  body: You won't find a match for Paramount - it's a neon sign not a font. There
    are a lot of sans that could give you this look - try Interstate for example.
