  body: Why is it necessary to have a new font format? <BR>Surely browsers should
    be able to work with any font, and why not the OpenType format? <BR> <BR>I just
    don&#39;t understand what the difficulty is. <BR>1. Load fonts on site server
    with other web info. <BR>2. Download fonts used on a web page when it is opened.
    <BR>3. Delete font when page is closed. <BR> <BR>If engineers can figure out streaming
    video, surely streaming fonts shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

    to Web pages, especially if you have to download them every time you view a page.
    Compression and subsetting are required to keep the font sizes small. There was
    also the issue of a page designers rights to embed a given font and the protection
    of the embedded font. <BR> <BR>The web font wars, at least with respect to embedded

  body: The web is a medium that is very much about accessibility. It is as much about
    end-user preferences and whims is it is about back end designer&#39;s preferences
    and whims. <BR> <BR>Font embedding didn&#39;t take off because it&#39;s not really
    needed for the medium to work.  <BR> <BR>Flash methods like sIFR are actually
    quite useful for a bit of specific font spec&#39;ing here and there, but I&#39;d
    never dream of setting an entire page using the technique. And, honestly, I&#39;m
    quite happy with the current selection of typeface for most web work I do. In
    the end, it doesn&#39;t matter how much I like Univers, if the end user prefers
    verdana, so be it.

  body: I&#39;m surprised that sIFR hasn&#39;t made a bigger splash, actually. It&#39;s
    a little hinky here and there, but it basically works. Its biggest drawback is
    that it can&#39;t reliably draw with a transparent background. Also, at least
    with Safari, sIFR&#39;d text, though it can be selected, can&#39;t be copied to
    the clipboard, which breaks one of its benefits. I&#39;m cool with existing screen
    fonts for text. It&#39;s not great, but I can live with it for the moment. But
    I&#39;m glad to have the option of any font I choose for headings without resorting
    to images.

  body: The real issue is that it&#39;s not safe to assume that everyone browsing
    your site has any given fonts at all installed. While Microsoft was distributing
    their core fonts for the web, it was safe-ish, and we can assume that most clued-up
    web users will have the usual suspects &#40;Verdana, Georgia, Courier, etc.&#41;
    installed, there&#39;s no real way to present a consistent typographical feel
    to everyone. <BR> <BR>sIFR is an elegant hack for dealing with display type &#40;and
    I appreciate the lengths its creators pursued to avoid interfering with assistive
    technologies&#41;, but it sucks for body type. I&#39;ve read enough working group
    messages to think this may be infeasibly complicated in the near to medium term,
    especially because browser developers don&#39;t seem to see much percentage in
    tangling with it anymore.
