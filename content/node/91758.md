body: Hi everyone, I'm searching for recommendations for an alternative to Futura
  Condensed Extra Black. The type will be used for a small logo and I'm hoping for
  it to have a "street" feeling. Ie the way that Futura Condensed Extra Black is used
  by Nike. Many thanks for any recommendations that come this way.
