body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCan someone please help with a kerning problem or at least point
  me in the right direction?  I am creating a cursive font.  (apologies for the lengthily
  explanation below, I hope it makes sense!!)\r\n\r\nAttached are three screenshots
  \u2013 1)  showing the two glyph variations of the letter \u2018a\u2019 joining
  up smoothly within the metric window 2)  showing the preview panel correctly substituting
  the second glyph and smoothly joining up and 3) the output in MS WordPad when I
  try to get the same result as above.  As you can see, the \u2018calt\u2019 substitutions
  work correctly, as all the glyphs displayed are the ones without an entry stroke,
  except for the first character.  However, as you can see, the spacing is not correct
  for every glyph displayed after the second character.  The fact that the spacing
  is correct between the first two characters seems to show that it is possible for
  WordPad to pick up on the kerning, I just can\u2019t figure out how to do it for
  EVERY glyph instance repetitively.  The same issue applies to Word 2007.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any idea why I am getting this problem or where I can go to find a solution
  I would be most grateful \u2013 I have searched through this forum, the FL Manual,
  the Fontlab msn user group, VOLT user group, and various other reference sites.
  \ I really need to get this sorted urgently as other people are relying on the finished
  font.  \r\n\r\nIs the issue associated with using PUA glyphs?  I have tried including
  the kerning encoding MAC with PUA (also attached as screenshot) but this didn\u2019t
  help.  I\u2019m using FL 5.04.  Surely if PUA is the issue, the first substitution
  would not join correctly?\r\nI have read the other posts in this forum but nothing
  suggested there helped.\r\n\r\nIf you need a sample font / .vfb file, I cam mail
  it.\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance,\r\n\r\nNikki\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fontlab_Preview_5516.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Metrics_window_5782.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WordPad_screenshot_4288.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerningOtpions_window_4827.JPG]"

  body: "As far as I know, Word has always had kerning turned off by default. I don't
    know if that is still the case in the newest version though. Wordpad probably
    as well, if it even supports kerning.\r\n\r\nEdit: I should read better. You are
    talking metrics. Oh well, it seems it doesn't use those either."

  body: WordPad is an RTF editor, so there might be something in the  [[http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/f/5/2f599e18-07ee-4ec5-a1e7-f4e6a9423592/Word2007RTFSpec9.doc|Microsoft
    Word 2007 Rich Text Format Specification]]. A possibility might be ANSI versus
    Unicode kerning pair information (see the entry for \krnprsnet at the bottom of
    page 65).

  body: "Hi again,\r\n\r\nFirst off, thanks for all the comments, I am new this area
    and really appreciate all the help.\r\n\r\nYes the kerning works as expected in
    InDesign - see attached screenshot. \r\n\r\nI am not too worries about the application
    of the calt feature; it is the kerning I am worried about.\r\n\r\nI have the complex
    script support activated and it still does not work within Notepad / Wordpad or
    Word.  Although I do need to get the kerning working without support for complex
    script activated (is this even possible???)   \r\n\r\nSince it seems to be a Microsoft
    issue, I think I'll try doing the kerning within VOLT... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/In_Design_screenshot_5175.JPG]"

  body: "Nikki, \r\n\r\nthere are two types of kerning: OpenType (kern feature in
    GPOS table) and TrueType (old-style kern table). FontLab Studio lets you specify
    which type of kerning (just one or both) you are including in your font (Preferences
    / Generating OpenType & TrueType / Kerning). \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "All the spacing works in notepad, still not in word, but that is ok as we
    wrote a custom application to use the font in.  \r\nIn case anyone else is interested,
    we use a rich edit control text box, which seems to handle the spacing perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all your help.\r\n\r\nNikki  "
