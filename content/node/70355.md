  photoshop...\r\n\r\nHere I'm posting a screenshot of font-family menu in photoshop.
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_6520.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would
  like to have just one choice for knockout in font family menu, and all other sub-weight
  in font-style menu. But instead, I have all the weights in font-family menu..\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  have the same problem with some other fonts too.\r\n\r\nI was searching the forum,
  but I didn't find such a topic..\r\n\r\nThanks for your help..\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "The font menus are build from information from within the font files themselves.
    If this is how it comes out, there is nothing you can do about it (unless you
    made the fonts).\r\n\r\nTechnical background: in a proper font family, the <em>entire</em>
    family should have the same name, and each of the styles should have an additional
    unique name. If the <em>family</em> is called \"Knockout HTF94-UltmtSumo\" for
    one font, and \"Knockout HGTF93-UltmtHeviwt\" for the other, all software -- no
    matter how smart -- will <em>think</em> it's actually <em>two</em> different families.\r\n\r\nIt's
    kinda sloppy of the font creator; contact them if it bothers you."

    knockout fonts and they are all properly named..family-name knockout, when I click
    get info..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot2_4078.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
    that mean it is problem somewhere deeper inside the font files?\r\n\r\n"
