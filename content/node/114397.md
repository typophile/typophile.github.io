  body: "You have done at least eight posts in the the past three weeks with the same
    title \"Please help me identify the name of this font.\" This reduces your chance
    of having someone check your post for something they can identify. At least use
    some key words such as script, logo, package, serif, sans etc. The more specific
    you are in your title the more likely a type detective familiar with that category
    will read your post.\r\nAlso if you know where the the lettering appeared and
    when, state this information in your post.\r\nDon"
