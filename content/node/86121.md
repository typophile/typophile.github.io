  body: "With just a few letters it's not easy to say, \r\nbut I think the following
    is a good choice:\r\n<strong>Baskervlle2 BT Roman<strong>  (c) Copyright 1990-1999
    Bitstream Inc\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baskerville-no-2/\r\n\r\nI
    suppose the very tight kerning and the 'o' overhanging bellow baseline,\r\nare
    the logo-designer's choices."
