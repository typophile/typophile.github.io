body: "I have a semi large type family that has a problem with installing certain
  fonts that receive an error stating that they are \"not a valid font file.\"\r\n\r\nThe
  type family is set up with 3 sub families like this:\r\n\r\nfontname-regular\r\nfontname-regular-italic\r\n\r\nfontname-alt1-regular\r\nfontname-alt1-regular-italic\r\n\r\nfontname-alt2-regular\r\nfontname-alt2-regular-italic\r\n\r\nIf
  you google \"was not a valid fontfile\", you'll discover a host of problems and
  solutions from the users end. But my issues only seem to effect the 'alt2' sub-family
  of the typeface which makes me think this is a problem caused on my part. \r\n\r\nWhen
  installing the complete typeface, it only seems to effect 1 or 2 fonts in the alt2
  sub-family, and not always the same two.\r\n\r\n I've encountered the problem on
  both osx 10.6.8 and winXP\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to look at the fonts, please
  let me know and I'll send you the files.\r\n\r\n"

    page, check the \"yin/Yang\" looking button which checks for errors in font names.
    \r\n\r\nAlthough this is just a guess, it could be something else completely.

  body: "Thanks for your help so far. After remaking one font from an old working
    file, I tracked the issue down to one stylistic alternative. When I renamed the
    guilty character from k.salt to k.alt, the font exports and installs without problem.
    \r\n\r\nNo idea why the salt doesn't work in one subfamily of fonts, but is fine
    in the others... but at least it's usable now!"
