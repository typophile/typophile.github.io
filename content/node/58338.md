body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm finishing up a large font family and will make instances
  from my multiple master font of the weights inbetween my masters. This works just
  fine, but... it doesn't interpolate the kerning pairs. More than that, there are
  NO kerning pairs in my new MM font. \r\nI've got about 900 kerning pairs in my masters.
  I did a class based kerning which looks just fine to me.\r\nPeter Bruhn told me
  that the both masters should have exactly the same kerning pairs, otherwise no kerning
  is interpolated? Is this true? \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why the kerning date isn't
  interpolated and how to correct this? \r\n\r\nthnx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    masters that represents the same pairs?\r\nSame amount of pairs also?\r\n\r\nThey
    must be the same if they are going to get interpolated, and they must represent
    same pairs also. Otherwise the odd pairs will not be interpolated.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you say there are NO kerning pairs in your new MM font, what do you mean? Were
    you not taking out instances FROM an MM-font?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Goran, the pairs are exactly the same, I duplicated them. I just didn't create
    the same amount of kerning pairs, because the extra bold not always needed them.
    \r\n\r\nCorrection, there are 425 pairs out of 900, but NO kerning classes. \r\nAnd
    yes, I created the instances from the MM font.\r\n\r\nJames, does Superpolator
    do the job correctly even if the kerning pairs and/or kerning classes don't match?"

  body: Is it an upcoming Fountain font? In that case I think you should send the
    MM to Peter for inspection, these things are so much easier to problem-solve when
    one can have a look at the actual MM source file.

    do you exactly mean James?</em>\r\n\r\nIn my (very limited) experience using MM
    in Fontlab some little things alway goes wrong. Fixing those little things can
    add up to a good deal of wasted time. As someone who still has a lot to learn
    about type design this is especially irritating because I really need to focus
    on problems with my type and not problems with my software. But I have never had
    problems with Superpolator as long as my paths and nodes match up, which is pretty
    easy to do with the compare script that Erik provides.\r\n\r\n<em>James, does
    Superpolator do the job correctly even if the kerning pairs and/or kerning classes
    don\u2019t match?</em>\r\n\r\nSuperpolator assumes all missing pairs to be zero,
    so values still get interpolated. "

    to hear. I'm not that familiar with superpolator, but that's just the way it should
    be. No kerning pair means a zero value. So simple...\r\n\r\nthnx"

    that's the way it should be. Hopefully in next FontLab update for those who dont
    use Superpolator :)"

  body: "I've tried about every setting in Fontlab but on generating the MM font,
    the classes are just not there. I spent about 5 hours to match the kerning pairs
    in both fonts, but it makes no difference when I create the MM font. I have 290
    pairs in both masters, but in the new MM font I just have 74!! It only took some
    of the UC pairs. What could have happened to the other pairs? \r\nDoes anyone
    have a thought on that?"
