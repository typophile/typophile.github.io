body: "Doing a series of editorial pieces on classic motorsport (from 50s to today),
  mainly F1, Le Mans etc. The first piece centers around 1982 f1 season.\r\n\r\nIm
  looking suggestions for a typeface that exudes classic motorsport, but without being
  too tied to a particular era. The only face I can think of is HFJ's Tungsten, which
  would work well. Hoping for some suggestions of more \"unique\" fonts, everywhere
  I look I see Tungsten these days (it is a great face though!)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
