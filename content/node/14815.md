  body: "According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally updating two versions of
    Eurostile. \"Eurasia\" (an actual clone of Linotype Eurostile, Berthold's version)
    to come in 10 styles - Regular, Demi Bold, and Bold (each in the parts of regular
    and italic for the regular-\"widthed\" part only), plus the condensed and extended
    widths each come in the styles of \"regular\" and \"bold\", marking as SoftMaker's
    exclusive typeface family update. SoftMaker's other version of Eurostile appears
    to be \"MicroSquare\" under license from URW++, except that the typeface itself
    comes in all 5 styles for the \"regular\"-widthed part (Regular, Medium, Bold,
    Heavy & Black), plus the \"extended\"-widthed part comes in the styles of Regular
    & Black, the \"stencil\" part as an actual clone of \"Eurostile Extended Black
    Stencil\", and the small-caps part is two styles (Regular & Bold).\r\n\r\nThose
    font names are finally appearing on two of SoftMaker's premium-quality typeface
    collections - \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" (for home users) and \"infiniType 4\" (for
    designers) - both being released around May 27, 2014."

  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally updating two versions of
    "M730 Sans" (an actual clone of "Microgramma Extended" under license from Berthold/Brendel)
    to include the styles of Regular & Bold each for the "regular" and "small-caps"
    parts. SoftMaker's other version of Microgramma Extended appears to be called
    "Micro" (which comes in the styles of "regular" and "bold", and also under license
    from URW++). And of course, "M731 Sans" (an actual clone of Microgramma Deco,
    the older "Microgramma Bold Extended" in all-uppercase only form, which appears
    to be in the design of FontBank's Microbus and Southern Software's Chino SSi/SSK),
    appears in to join "M730 Sans" and "Micro" (the two actual clones of Microgramma
    Extended), and so these font names are finally appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0"
    and "infiniType 4" - the two premium-quality typeface collections from SoftMaker
    - both being released around May 27, 2014.

  body: "The difference between Microgramma (designed 1952 by [[Alessandro Butti]]
    and [[Aldo Novarese]] for [[Nebiolo]]) and Eurostile (designed 1962 by Aldo Novarese)
    is not only 10 years, but that Microgramma was <em>originally</em> a CAPS ONLY
    face.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of meeting Signore Novarese (pr. No-vah-reh-zay)
    and afterwards kept correspondence for a while.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nS\xEC,
    sono vecchio, ma sono indietro nello stile!"
