body: The golf course I work at is having an event to raise money for Breast Cancer
  research and this is part of the flyer (the text is solid and colored pink, but
  no color scanner available). Those in charge want to make keep all of the sign-up
  sheets, gift certificates, scorecards, etc consistent with this font, which (of
  course) they do not know the name of.  Please help.  Thank you[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5678.jpg]
