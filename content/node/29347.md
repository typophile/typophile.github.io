  body: "Check out \"Gravur Condensed Thin\" from http://www.lineto.com/ (which looks
    stunning btw.)\r\n(FF DIN Condensed light is too condensed and too thick, i think
    - is there no ultralight FF Din?)\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI checked it in the lineto typesetter
    - it would say, it is \"Gravur Condensed Thin\"\r\n"

  body: "I'm not certain how old this sample is. I also thought it might have been
    DIN, but the D in the versions I have seen is much more round.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the help! I'll take a look at Gravur."
