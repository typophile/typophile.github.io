  body: 'Thought about Tungsten too at first sight for ''POWER 96.1'' but I don''t
    think that''s the one: /R leg does not match (or at least you''d need to customize
    it), /1 top is off, /9 bowler bottom connection to vertical stem is off and counters
    are squarer for your sample. So if it''s Tungsten, it has been massively edited.
    Still searching...'

  body: "No idea about the font, but my first impression is that, whatever it may
    be, it has a some stroke applied to the outline that emboldens it (and perhaps
    partly alters the glyphs' shapes).\r\nMy hunch is that the client asked for \"more
    power\" ;)"

  body: "Obviously, I was a bit hasty in my ID of Tungsten. But I don\u2019t feel
    quite so bad, considering that no one else has been able to make a definitive
    ID.\r\n\r\nI reran individual letters and numbers, and didn't get any better hits
    for the overall shapes. |POWER| and |96.1| may very well be two different typefaces."
