    didn't Dr. Frankenstein invent digital fonts?\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n"

  body: "Norbert,\r\n\r\nthank you very much for your findings. Stark Bold is close,
    but it is really those angled terminals that caught my eye. So i am still happy
    about any suggestions.\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nPS> I don't think that digital fonts
    are monsters per se - but posters designed in Word that contain 15 different fonts
    certainly are.  "

  body: How about <a href="http://www.linotype.com/9642/macbethregular-font.html">Macbeth</a>?
    It isn't an exact match either, but it has some angles in it.

  body: "Perhaps Dr. Frankestein could put Macbeth's brain into Stark Bold's body.\r\nBut
    seriously... there are a myriad of analog type designs begging to be digitized
    and consider those faces yet to be designed.\r\n\r\nMaybe in another 20 years,
    Tenazas and Vignelli might add one more face to their repertoire. ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I could not find any current faces that look like your sample, but I did
    find more information on the face used in Frankenstein.\r\n\r\nDan Solo's sample
    of \"Othello\" was indeed correct. \r\nThough another typeface named \"Othello\"
    from Monotype was released in 1928, Morris Fuller Benton's \"Othello\" was released
    in 1934 by American Type Founders.\r\n\r\nHere is the only sample and availability
    (in hot metal) I could find:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.donblack.ca/fonts/o.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Don Black hot metal faces</a> (scroll down to page bottom)\r\n\r\nList
    of faces by <a href=\"http://www.typolexikon.de/b/benton-morris.html\">Morris
    Fuller Benton</a> (scroll down to \"O\").\r\n\r\nIt would make a great revival
    face since it is still very unique for display. If someone digitized it already,
    it hasn't shown up in any sans serif display cuts I've searched through (plus
    it probably isn't named \"Othello\" anymore).\r\n"

    Fiorello</a> my license from the stone ages has it as CG Fiorello. You'll have
    to alter a few characters, but it could be a fun exercise (in patience).
