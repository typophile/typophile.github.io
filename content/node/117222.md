  the Bauhaus book n\xB0 8, 1925. I can't find what fonts he uses. For the text there
  are a serif and a sans (maybe Futura?) and a sans for the titles(all in uppercase).
  There is anybody that can help me? \r\nThank you a lot!\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Fh2aCkgfh6Q/TEqoWtIAjQI/AAAAAAAAA70/-Dgr4EIFWd8/s1600/2.jpg"

  body: For the sans (both text and headlines), I would have said [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers|Univers]]
    but it has been designed by Adrian Frutiger in 1957, 30 years later after your
    sample...

  body: "Checked Tempo, an R. H. Middleton design from 1930-42 and found it very similar,
    but note that it has a splayed M and straight leg R. Stempel Sans/Neuzeit Grotesque
    by C. W. Pischner (1928) might be a match, including the leg on the _R_ in the
    version \"Neuzeit Book -S.\" Other versions have a different leg on the _R_.\r\nBut
    this is three years after the publication date. Perhaps an earlier design by Pischner?
    More digging needed.\r\nDon"

  body: "The scan you provide is of the original \"Malerei Fotografie Film\" from
    1925? Because the English text would suggest a later translation.\r\nAnyway, for
    what I can tell, at least the bold type seems the same in German too (see, for
    example: http://culturevisuelle.org/icones/files/2013/09/moholy_MFF_dynamik-grossstadt.jpg)."

    mind, I'm going to reaffirm the guess that this is Univers, with the publication
    date significantly later. No need to overthink it."

    what Johan said. The discussion sample is definitely not the original edition,
    everything is set with a complete different sans close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/halogen|Halogen]]
    or [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview|Idlewid]]."
