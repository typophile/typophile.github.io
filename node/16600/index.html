<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>How come nobody ever talks about Blackletter? It is absolutely everywhere. Advertisers are using it like it is going out of style and clothing designers are using Blackletters as if they are logos.
I asked Armin at Under Consideration if he should revisit a blog he did in April on the poularity of Blackletter. He responded by saying, “Blackletter is at its peak on mainstream, it can, sadly, only go downhill from here. It became too trendy for its own good.”
How can a typeface that is over 500 years old be considered going downhill?!!
Why is Blackletter so popular right now? Where did this stronghold on popular culture come from? And don’t tell me that the Germans are the influence.

<div class=commentbody><em>How can a typeface that is over 500 years old be considered going downhill?!!</em>
[[Blackletter]] is not a "typeface," but a whole family of scripts. Some styles are more popular than others, with the [[textura]] variety being the forerunner and maybe [[fraktur]] coming in at second place, but a lot of blackletter is still fairly obscure, imo.
Maybe blackletter is so popular now for the same reason that other scripts are: i think it's a backlash against the "techno" style: whereas evertything used to be cool if it were futuristic and seemingly made by machine, people now want to be able to feel the influence of the human hand in their design. Of course, scientific studies could prove all my ramblings above are just bunk, but that's my gut reaction.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the mention, Vince. And who drew the 3rd Tuesday titling
for the Typo Circle...?
http://www.typocircle.co.uk/index.live
Armin Vit may be right about the peaking of hipness...
designers ought to use blackletter typefaces and lettering
for the same reasons they choose decorative italics, or
blocky sans: 'cause they look good or corporate or festive or evil or...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, Chris is right. I actually think that we talk about blackletter quite a lot. I know that blackletter is all over the place now, but I don't think its a new fad… I think that fad has been running more or less pretty strong since about 1991. You might as well go and ask Miles Newlyn why he drew Savage Black… maybe the "trend" is even older… Didn't Licko start Totally Gothic is in 1988?
Whatever the cause for the blackletter fad is, it certainly is *not* the Germans. German designers won't touch the stuff with a ten-foot pole. This is US driven, primarily, although the stuff can be seen all over North, Central, and South America, plus the UK and some of continental Europe.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John Butler knows a lot about blackletter too.
He has even started a dedicated section here:
http://typophile.com/forum/11 _
But something is wrong with it - it's missing
most of the content! Please fix it guys.
If blackletter is indeed a fading fad now, maybe that means it's high time to take it deeper?* Also, I hope the Germans jump in - they should in fact be leading the movement.

<div class=commentbody>Just to clarify one thing... My quote above was preceded by "Blackletter has made its way to an <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B66PD4/uc-20/ target=_blank>Ashlee Simpson</a> CD cover." It was within the context of this <a href=http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002273.html target=_blank>discussion</a> – blackletter typography in mainstream. Hence, the rest of my comment. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I saw an interview on MuchMusic (Canada's MTV) about 10 years ago, I think it was with a metal band from Sao Paulo. Anyway, the guy said Blackletter was like Europe's ethnic thing, now that the Latin had become globalized.
That's the same way the Siberian (?) throat singer who did "Levee breaks" said that Led Zeppelin was, from his perspective, world music. Or Memphis Minnie at least.
So blackletter is historic, ethnic, gothic (in every sense).
The present vogue is not necessarily nasty gangsta/satanic/ethnic/historicist though, a lot of it is pure formality, to do with the fabulous flourishes. Go Marian! (Same vibe as Spencerian flourishing.)
It's such a rich vein, capable of holding so many meanings. </div>
