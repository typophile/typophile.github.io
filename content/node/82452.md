  really appreciate any feedback people might be willing to give. I'm a graphic designer
  but am fairly new to identity design.\r\n\r\nThe Organisation train and then send
  volunteers into care homes to engage in one-to-one educational activities with care
  home residents. It is funded partly through the care homes, who pay a small fee,
  and through grants. Each volunteer brings their own set of skills to the Organisation
  and they are then matched with residents who might be interested in engaging in
  that activity - for example an arts student might visit a care home to teach watercolours
  to people interested in learning watercolour painting. \r\n\r\nI picked the dandelion
  as an icon as the florets, when composed together create the larger dandelion structure
  and symbolically this could be applied to the volunteers which work for the Organisation.
  When they work together under the Orangisation's stewardship they achieve a joint
  goal. The dandelion seeds also represent new life, and a number of the residents
  are often learning new skills that they wouldn''t have necessarily had the opportunity
  to in the past. \r\n\r\nAny feedback or suggestions would be most welcomed and appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks"

  body: I'm afraid that I see an evil eye rather than a dandelion, and the individual
    seeds have a devilish, trident look. A different colour might help, however I
    think in this context a dandelion could be seen as a bit morbid. It is the end
    of the flower's life and the fragile head disintegrates in the wind. I think this
    aspect is the more likely response to a dandelion than the possibility that the
    seeds might grow again.

  body: I don't have the same negative feeling about dandelion seeds that Justin mentions
    (I associate them with kids blowing the seeds off) but I do agree with his comments
    about your drawing. If you want to stick with the dandelion theme, I'd redraw
    it from scratch. Try a more naturalistic stroke - the monoline approach looks
    weird and conflicts with the font you chose. And try some other colors. It might
    look better with a few less seeds, and the trident tip looks strange.

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback - Much appreciated. I now see where
    you are coming from with the devil trident - Not something that occurred to me
    during the design process but is now completely apparent! I'm inclined to pursue
    the dandelion symbolism further for now as I don't see the negative connotations
    however I will look at some sketching variants and a more naturalistic approach.
    \r\n\r\nMany thanks again for your comments and I'll update with new visuals soon.\r\n "

    had been on the path of something more abstract but maybe this more literal interpretation
    is the way to go? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches_5770.jpg]"

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWork is in progress with the more naturalistic approach to
    the dandelion icon however in the meantime I thought I'd share some other options
    that I keep finding myself revisiting. I've attached just the concepts of the
    graphics, separated from the type for now. \r\n\r\nSeparately from the type/ natural
    approach does anyone see anything worthy in these options? The first option revolves
    around the pen nib (as representative of learning) and was an earlier concept
    I looked at and the second two look again at the dandelion but back in the mono-line
    mannor. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/l4a-logo-v_6587.8.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
    thoughts on these would be appreciated as would any type suggestions ( I used
    Fontin for the first but am open to other suggestions) \r\n\r\nMany thanks"

  body: middle one does a good job, but really mimics the apankrat's sample pretty
    closely. i can't help but wonder why a dandelion? i get the idea, but can't help
    escaping that it's a weed and commonly recognized as a nuisance. would flower
    pedals create a similar feel? It would be a start of something beautiful/colorful/inspiring
    versus something that represents the end of something?

    be great to get any opinions in this version. I think Candara works better than
    Fontin so am contemplating the switch but have included both versions. \r\n\r\nThe
    image obviously is based on a flower form as opposed to the dandelion. Think I
    was on a hiding to nothing by persisting with that concept ;) \r\n\r\nAny input

  body: i like it so far, but wonder if the center dot in the flower is to big. i
    love the idea of a star in the center. ties in nicely with the idea of achievement.
    might not need the dot. maybe work the size of the star and pedals so that star
    isn't too big either. =)
