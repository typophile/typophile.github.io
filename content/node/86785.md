  shirts? The really block slab-serifed one...\r\n\r\nAlso, what are some good fonts
  used for athletic purposes. Ex. Eurostile is used on the back of some futbol uniforms. "

  body: 'I have done a lot of designs for high school and college sports teams--a
    vestige of being a parent--and some of fonts that I use a lot are Chevin, Eras,
    Morgan Avec and Morgan Sans, Soho and Soho Gothic and Vitesse in various weights
    and widths. They are solid and read well when screened and/or sublimated. They
    are also a little more current in appearance than the ''old school'' look of Princetown
    and this appeals to athletes as well as the parents, coaches, staff or school
    paying for it. '
