    sans and serif just in the last week. I don't think she's there yet, but give
    her a little while - she just turned two on Thursday.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "That was a great story! \r\n\r\nMy nine year old and eleven-teen year old
    daughters are very good at giving me constructive comments when I bring student
    typography projects home to grade. \"I can't believe they chose that typeface!\"
    or \"That type is completely unreadable, don't you think?\" or \"The kerning on
    that seems a little off, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nYou are never too young to appreciate
    type."
