  used a few years back as the masthead of Nova Magazine if anyone remembers that?\r\n\r\nMany,

    is a custom face it's been used several times and in different contexts..."

  body: "I agree. I feel that the connection to Clearface made by Akira and Jan seemed
    reasonable, because of the shape of the 'a' and the way that the 'v' and 'y' were
    formed, but there are so many differences. Has this font ever been seen anywhere
    else, or just as used by Nova Magazine? If only Nova uses it, then the custom
    font idea (perhaps using Clearface as an 'inspiration') is probably the right
    answer, but if it is showing up anywhere else, then I think we need a new explanation.\r\n\r\n-
