  me or at least say how you pronounce them\r\n\r\nHaas (hahss? ahss?)\r\nAkzidenz
  Grotesk (always said ack-zee-dens gro-tesk, but I've heard a type director say a
  weird pronunciation along the lines of ack-zee-den grawt. Possible abbreviation?)\r\nLubalin

    and ask if we had the typeface \"Arostel\".\r\n\r\nArostel? Never heard of it.
    He didn't have anything with the name on it in front of him; it was given to him
    verbally. After several minutes on the phone with him, he was able to more or
    less describe it to us, and we finally figured it out.  Eurostile.\r\n\r\nWe all
    had a good laugh about that one."
