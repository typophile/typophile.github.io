  80th Birthday\" stuff, I saw that they've redone Meridien;  The new version is called
  \"Frutiger Serif,\" and has added more weights, a condensed version, lining and
  OSF, both proportional and tabular, small caps, extra characters, some revised characters,
  etc.  Since Meridien has long been one of my favorites, I couldn't resist buying
  a bunch of the weights, and discovered that they've somehow added a \"private space\"
  that makes everything accessible from Microsoft Word.  Haven't checked to see whether
  this screws up things in InDesign.  The weights are slightly different than their
  previous Meridien (digital) equivalents, and they've futzed slightly with the spacing
  so that, for example, Frutiger Serif Medium now pretty much matches the old hot
  metal Meridien from D&P.  \r\n\r\nI've only been playing around with Frutiger Serif
  for a couple of hours, but, so far, this looks to be a seriously nice revision that
  cures just about all of the flaws/weirdnesses/omissions that hurt the old Linotype
  Meridien and the extra weights and condensed version make it a lot more versatile.
  \ Check it out.  They've even broadened out the lower-case \"f\" and provided a
  \"normal\" ampersand, although the original \"gallic\" ampersand is there as an
  alternative."
