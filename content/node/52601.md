  wonder if anyone knows an authority that supports what I have always considered
  good practice. I don't think it's my idea, but something I was taught years ago.\r\n\r\nI
  believe that the range en dash should have no space around it if it joins the same
  units, so:\r\n\r\nJuly\u2013August\r\nFebruary 25\u201328\r\n1975\u20131996\r\n\r\nbut
  should have spaces around if the range is being expressed by different units, so:\r\n\r\nJuly
  5 \u2013 August 6\r\n4 July 1965 \u2013 7 January 1966\r\n\r\nThis approach seems
  particularly better in the second case, because \"4 July 1965\u20137 January 1966\"
  results in a moment of confusion as the reader perceives the range as \"1965\u20137\",
  but even the first case \"July 5\u2013August 7\" creates an unnaturally strong visual
  unit between the 5 and August.\r\n\r\nI know the Chicago disagrees with me, but
  I think the Chicago is wrong.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nrgh"

  body: I'm in between. I like a little bit of space, but not a full space, which
    is just too much. I don't think the dash should touch whatever figures are before
    or after it.

    best. I prefer no space and if the relationship between the dash and the letter/number
    is troublesome just kern the thing. A full space looks a little too much.

  body: I agree with Bruce. I like having some space, but depending on the situation,
    a full character space may be too much. Inserting a smaller space in InDesign
    may be a better practice. Ultimately I believe these considerations are based
    upon the larger context of the piece on which you are working. The "negative/whitespace"
    that surrounds each letterform and each word must be carefully managed to create
    the feeling you want and effectively convey the information. Looking at the spacing
    attributes of an en dash in relation to the whole, as opposed to a general rule
    of practice, is very important. I also think that different typefaces require
    different spacing. I have always viewed the Chicago manual (and all such style
    manuals) as grammatic usage guides which are not specifically geared toward the
    needs of typographers and graphic designers. As such I design according to the
    benefit of the piece.

  body: "Thanks for the thinks. Yes, I prefer the thin space (if I am putting a space
    in) over the word space, and I will often globally kern en dash/number relationships
    (thanks to Quark XPress's kerning table edit) \r\n\r\nIt is, as Charles says,
    \ the editor's call, and on this job I will be doing it what I think is the \"wrong\"
    way. But what I'm curious about is if there is any documentary support for this
    approach (determined by function, not aesthetics) to dashes in these cases, i.e.,
    July\u2013August (no space) and July 5 \u2013 August 12 (space). \r\n\r\nI wonder
    if it is a British approach, because their traditions on the relationship between
    quotations and other punctuation has usually been determined by usage more that
    appearances. For example, the British would favour 'He said he was \"sick\".'\r\n\r\nBecause
    \"sick\" is quoted within the sentence, the period must fall outside. In North
    America, the sentence would be:\r\n\r\nHe said he was \"sick.\"\r\n\r\nwith the
    period inside the quotes.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps it's a mstter of national philosophy.\r\n\r\n"

  body: With the rise of computers, the British approach to punctuating quotations
    has gained a lot of ground in North America, because it is logical. Many people
    in the last few generations, who have at some point learned at least a little
    programming, tend to feel that something that is not part of the string quoted
    has no business being inside the quotation marks.

    agree with Linda, have your own style--and I think this will be intimately related
    to the typefaces that you prefer, and the way that you use them. \r\n\r\nAnd having
    your own style is something that the boss should respect, especially if you publish
    it. Type houses used to have their own house styles, but as they are no more,
    doesn't that responsibility succeed to those graphic designers and art directors,
    the digital typographers who have assumed the mantle?"

    are stuck with Chicago \u2013 tight dashes and loose ellipses.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    in the US there isn't a formal space before and after the en-dash but I do often
    cheat a little in there for aesthetic purposes. In QUARK (I know, shoot me, I
    still use it sometimes) you could add that space in via kerning tables, but Adobe
    has not seen fit to incorporate that feature into InDesign."

  body: "I'm sure everybody would agree that \"The Elements of Typographic Style\"
    by Robert Bringhurst is one of the most authoritative books on typography ever,
    and it says:\r\n\r\n5.2.1 Use close-set en dashes or three-to-em dashes between
    digits to indicate a range.\r\n\r\nThus: 3--6 November; 4:30--5:00 PM; 25--30
    mm. [...]\r\n\r\nWhen compound terms are linked with a dash in the midst of running
    prose, subtle clues of size and spacing can be crucial, and confusion can easily
    arise. A sentence such as <em>The office will be closed 24 December -- 3 January</em>
    is a linguistic and typographic trap. When it stands all alone in a schedule or
    list, the phrase <em>25 December -- 3 January</em> will be clear, but in running
    prose it is better both editorially and typographically to omit the dash and insert
    an honest preposition: <em>25 December to 3 January</em>."

    from time to time, it is useful.\r\n\r\nI like the rest of your post, but again,
    it is the editor's call in a author > editor > designer > (maybe comp) workflow.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nPatty,\r\n\r\nI've always gotten around certain editorial prejudices
    on small matters by doing the work in the font. Ever since PostScript fonts and
    Fontographer became available, I've gone into the fonts & reworked them. Mostly
    this is kerning, and if you wanted to kern the digit-dash-digit combinations,
    thats how to do it.\r\n\r\nI started using an em dash of three-quarter's em length
    with 1/8-em l&r sidebearings to help Richard Eckersley (British) reach a compromise
    with his editors at Nebraska. In the end, Richard preferred this to either the
    word-spaced en-dash or full-length em dash. With this dash, I've only been called
    by an editor once in 16 years, and the explanation of \"that's how it is in the
    font\" seemed to satisfy them. \r\n\r\nFurther refinements can be to set the width
    of the \"ink\" in the dash to the width of a capital M or W, whichever is longer,
    again with the small but significant sidebearings.\r\n\r\nThe en-dash needs work
    too, as all too often it has no sidebearings. This may be the source of the original
    post. I usually start by giving the en-dash the same sidebearings as the hyphen,
    & work from there. Kerning is still needed.\r\n\r\nThis post is a bit off topic,
    because all these treatments of the dash build the spacing into the dash itself,
    so it is the same for all contexts. Still, it seems to be this *sameness* that
    gets things by most editors -- and it has been my experience that the few with
    a good enough eye to notice appreciate the work & go along with it."

  body: "Thanks Henry, I think my source might have been a Bringhurstism. He doesn't
    appear to say it explicitly, but in  \"The office will be closed 24 December \u2014
    3 January\" he clearly includes spaces (I did refer to the book itself) around
    the dash (though he says a \"to\" is better), and does explicitly say  that \"between
    digits\" and \"in a range\" the en dash should have no space. So my belief is
    (sort of) in line with Bringhurst. Like Charles, I don't necessarily agree with
    Bringhurst, but when he agrees with me, I think he's very authoritative....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
