  body: "Great. \r\n\r\nHere's the first complaint :) I was staring at this list of
    Sans Serifs for a good minute before noticing the warning at the top. What's the
    point of showing this list to a site visitor if it's guaranteed that it will not
    show right ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sans-serif-typekit_3855.png]\r\n"

    is not going to work at all on non-compliant browsers, or very well in user environs
    set to alias type. If one does not want to upgrade or poke ones preferences into
    line, one must read the bright red sign at the top. \r\n\r\nNot showing anything
    is anti-web, and showing a completely different page is probably useless. \r\n\r\nCheers!

  body: "@epsilicon\r\nI'm confused by the phrase \"Typekit does not yet fully support\".\r\nDoes
    the browser you're using support this @font-face thingy or not?\r\nIf it does,
    then Typekit gets a black eye.\r\nIf your browser doesn't then there should be
    a much larger alert to that fact. IMHO"

  body: "I'll bet he's using Chrome.\r\n\r\nMe too, but I flip the runtime switch
    to get it to read TTF/OTF fonts just fine, which works pretty well.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I've seen spotty behavior from TypeKit @font-face even in an environment
    where it ought to be pretty flawless: FireFox 3.5 (latest dot) on Windows XP.
    Not sure why, but there are plenty of subtleties in @font-face implementation,
    so I don't know that I should gripe too loudly when it doesn't work perfectly
    all the time, yet.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Nope, I am using Firefox 3.0, but that's beside the point. Including in the
    page elements that are known to <em>not</em> show correctly is like making the
    car mark its right turn if the left turn signal is burnt out. Is it blinking ?
    Yes, it does. Alright then, what's the problem ? :)

  body: "But what is being displayed is content, i.e text, and what you are getting
    is the expected fallback behaviour for text display in a browser that does not
    support served fonts. It is only the fact that in this case the content is also
    intended to be a specimen of served fonts that makes it seem peculiar. What you
    are seeing is normal, expected and a pretty good demonstration of what your browser
    will do when it encounters served fonts in the wild (only in the wild, you won't
    get any warning that the text is not displayed as intended).\r\n\r\nYour car metaphor
    doesn't make sense to me. If the content of the text were being changed, then
    a parallel to a semantic distinction such as a left/right indicator would be appropriate,
    but the content is not being changed, it is only being displayed with a fallback
    font. The correct parallel would be an arm waved out the window in place of an
    indicator, with both the indicator and the arm indicating the same direction."

    point of @font-face...it doesn''t interfere with getting to the actual text regardless
    of whether one can see the specific typeface or not. '

  body: "@epsilicon\r\nIf you're using FF 3.0, then my quibble is with the ambiguity
    of the message.\r\nShould be more like: \"Schmuck, use a browser that supports
    @font-face if you expect to see anything useful.\"\r\nThe message implies that
    they have not \"yet\" found a way to make @font-face work in FF3. You'll be waiting
    a long time for that. ;)\r\nrich"
