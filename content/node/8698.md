body: So i was wondering if anyone had some interesting images of well known typefaces
  in progress and under the knife? i think it would be great to be able to see Helvetica
  or Univers being drawn or redrawn by hand. Maybe not even something that well known,
  just something being actually made by hand. I&#39;ve seen some sort of images of
  Renner&#39;s Futura being constructed mostly since it&#39;s based on hard geometry
  and visual proof of that is exciting to see as well as revealing, so i really think
  seeing other typefaces in such circumstances would be wonderfully eye-opening and
  informative. any insight would be much appreciated!

  body: well, i didnt think showing progress work would fall under the realm of copyright
    infringement, but i guess it depends how you obtain it. time travel would be ok
    i guess...

  body: Significant collections are available to those who can travel and can persuade
    the curators that they have a reason better than curiosity; keep in mind that
    most museums have an obligation to preserve, and it doesn&#39;t get much flimsier
    than working sketches and inked sheets. Some designers have had retrospectives
    issued in their name, or major exhibitions that, thankfully, were accompanied
    by substantial catalogues -- these are pretty easy to locate. However, a major
    work has been announced for publication in a couple of months that has not appeared
    on any pre-publication reviews yet, so I will shamelessly take the opportunity
    to plug <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1584561556/qid=1106087052/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_6/102-7146946-0712100?v=glance&amp;s=books"
    target="_blank"><i>Printer&#39;s Type in the Twentieth Century</i></a>. It covers
    its subject through well-illustrated case-studies that should prove manna to any
    hungry brain.
