Saul Bass, early twentieth century designer, was one of the first artists I selected. His work is categorized as a branch of New York School. I selected this piece and this artists because the style seemed so modern to me. Not modern in the sense that you see exact replicas today, but modern in the sense that you can see influences of Bass, in work today. The movie, Catch Me If You Can being an example. I also liked how his work is disheveled, yet neat and organized. His type maintains personality and is made beautiful by its smooth imperfections.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/00043049_6377.jpg" alt="">
Lester Beall, noted for his contributions to the Modern Movement in America. I selected this artists because I liked the simplicity of his concept. It is very straight forward and to the point. I enjoyed his slightly muted color palate, it created an interesting contrast in my opinion.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/paul_rand_logos_5403.jpg" alt="">
Paul Rand, was a profound designer of the Corporate Identification period of design history. I selected this period and designer because of the incredible amount of patience, practice and skill it must have taken for him to create such timeless logos. I have tried in the past to create logos, and it is not as easy as one would think, therefore I can really appreciate the skill this task requires. The longevity of his designs are just amazing to me, they have been around for so many years, with on a few slight modifications here and there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Fine Print</em> magazine, c. 1990, reprinted this quote from Paul Rand, in which he recalled an encounter with another typographic titan of the 20th Century, Stanley Morison:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once had the pleasure of meeting him at the Garrick Club in London. He was sort of like the Pope. He sat there in a black suit with a little white collar, just like a priest. I decided, this is too much. I started to drink and I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea what he was talking about for about two hours.&rdquo;</p>
