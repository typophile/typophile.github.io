  body: The &#34;K&#34; is clotting. <BR>I&#39;d lower the bars of the &#34;A&#34;s
    and the middle join of the &#34;P&#34; as well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Here is an updated version of the logo. The middle joins have been moved down
    slightly. I&#39;m not sure what to do about the &#39;K&#39; yet. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Make diagonals endings of S, C, E, less diagonal and it will work better.
    <BR> <BR>Correct optically horizontal/vertical weight. <BR> <BR>Make the A bar
    lower, make P more bigger, so more lower for middel bar. <BR> <BR>Correct the
    middle joint of the K to avoid &#34;black hole&#34; at connection. <BR> <BR>Et

  body: I really like that E. <BR> <BR>The SPA seems looser to me than the CEK. Optically,
    anyway.

  body: Overally, is better. <BR> <BR>I wonder, why the diagonal angles on S are differents
    than CE?? <BR> <BR>K need again to be adjusted optically. <BR> <BR>the horizontal
    bar of the A still heavy compared to the middle bar of the E.

  body: okay, <BR> <BR>here is another revision. The horizontal bar of the A has been
    adjusted. The intersection on the K has been lowered, and the angle of the S has
    been changed on the top. <BR> <BR>I think that these details are starting to really
    work themselves out. thanks for the feedback <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11807.gif"

  body: and here is the wordmark with one of the possibilites for the logo. I want
    the logo to be clean and simple, yet have a feeling of strength.  the proportion
    of the logo to wordmark has not been finalized. just thought i&#39;d throw this
    up too <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11810.gif"

  body: Hey Ben- <BR> <BR>The A &#43; P crossbars should not be the same height. The
    bar in A ought to be distinctly lower.  <BR> <BR>The E &#43; P are the best letters
    thusfar.  <BR> <BR>The way you&#39;ve snipped the corners from the S doesn&#39;t
    make sense with the rest of your font. It results in a distinctly backwards slant
    in relation to the other letters.  <BR> <BR>The K is so clunky, and it feels like
    a chank rip-off. Fix the join and &#40;IMHO&#41; lose the 90

    bold on the vertical &#40;not too much&#41;, its just because its an open letter.
    <BR> <BR>then, send more bigger sample &#40;along with the original size to&#41;,
    its too small to see anything more.'

  body: Here is another revision. The C is slightly bolder on the vertical. not very
    noticeable, but I think that there is more visual balance now with the C.  The
    A is a bit wider. <BR> <BR>JFP --  what do you think about Karl&#39;s advice about
    adjusting the height of the crossbar for the A and the P? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11818.gif"
