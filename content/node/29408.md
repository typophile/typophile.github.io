  body: "Seems like standard cartoon eyes to me.\r\nThis could could basically be
    from any cartoon or brand character. A lot of product mascots (especially the
    ones from the 50s & 60s) are drawn with this type of eyes.\r\nMy guess is that
    this is custom made by some cartoon lover."

    did you consider that the sticker (inadvertently or otherwise) might have been
    placed upside down? It alters the appearance of the eyes considerably."
