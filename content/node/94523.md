  v. 4, then \u2018name\u2019 strings for family and subfamily are provided that are
  consistent with a weight/width/slope family model without requiring the use of \u2018name\u2019
  IDs 21 or 22.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'name' table for the \"Gabriola\" doesn't have the name
  ID's 21 and 22. The font \"Arial\" also doesn't have these name ID's, but it doesn't
  have the bit WWS set, in the OS/2 table. What's the difference between \"Gabriola\"
  and \"Arial\", regarding this bit ?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I just found out
  that, among the ~190 fonts used by MS Word, the font \"Gabriola\" is the only one
  that has this bit (WWS) set.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Arial is an old font, whose OS/2 and name table settings predate the bit
    8 and IDs 21 and 22 settings. Since it is an MS core font, there may be compatibility
    concerns in updating such settings in the font, and MS also have the option of
    providing special handling for it in their apps if necessary to make it behave
    correctly in DWrite environments. Remember, the WWS settings in the OS/2 and name
    tables are designed to improve processing times by giving the DWrite (previously
    WPF) system explicit information that it otherwise has to produce via heuristics.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was building Gabriola, which is a single style display type, I had to ask MS
    where in the DWrite font environment such a font should be classified. After some
    thought, they determined that a single-font 'family' fitted within the weight/width/slope
    family model, hence the bit 8 setting in Gabriola.\r\n\r\nThe bit 8 setting indicates
    to DWrite that a font is a member of a family that conforms to <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/text/archive/2009/04/15/introducing-the-directwrite-font-system.aspx\">the
    weight/width/slope model</a>, i.e. that each member of the family is differentiated
    from others only with regard to these three properties."

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nI have realized in the 'name' table that you were the font designer
    for Gabriola. Now reading what you wrote above I can see what WWS stands for (weight/width/slope).
    Could you elaborate a little bit more on this : \"Remember, the WWS settings in
    the OS/2 and name tables are designed to improve processing times by giving the
    WWS system explicit information that it otherwise has to produce via heuristics.\"\r\n\r\nI
    have just observed you edited your post. Let me read the link you provided, and
    I'll come back if necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    be null, for the Gabriola, Cambria and Cambria Math fonts, in the OS/2 table,
    instead of 0x0020 ?"

  body: 0x0020 is the word space character. In many fonts, esp CFF OpenType fonts
    following Adobe's practice, this will be the lowest character code in the font,
    and hence will be the entry for the OS/2 usFirstCharIndex field. In fonts that
    follow Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm">recommendations</a>,
    the second glyph in the font will be /NULL/ which will be encoded at 0x0000, which
    is then the lowest character code in the font. I make all my fonts following the
    MS recommendations for the first four glyphs (which in turn is based on Apple's
    original TrueType spec), even CSS fonts, since that means I can maintain a single
    source independent of output format; obviously I make an exception to this practice
    when I am making fonts for Adobe.
