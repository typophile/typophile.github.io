  body: "Does look like a taller Copperplate Gothic, but I'm hardly an expert.\r\n\r\nHow
    old is that bottle? Copperplate Gothic was released in 1901 (American, which makes
    me notice about the London and Edinburgh label), but you never know...\r\n\r\nThen
    again, could just be an imitation. I'll let the experts figure it out, I guess.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
