  body: Hey Stuart, nice job on Mister Retro, babe. But I think you&#39;re undervaluing
    your <a href="http://www.misterretro.com/vector_images.html">Snappy Hour</a> collection.
    Given what <a href="http://www.csaimages.com/">Chuck &amp; Co.</a> ask for similar
    imagery, you should be bumping and grinding your price up at least a notch or
    two.
