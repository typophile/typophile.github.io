  there are <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGFont/index.html\">API
  calls</a> for font variations. It kinda has the flavor of [[MultipleMaster]] technology
  to me. Does anybody know more about this (that they can talk about publicly)?\r\n\r\nIn
  a related question, does anyone know whether InDesign CS2 will automatically select
  the correct optical size when a suite is installed? I tried it in CS1 and it didn't
  seem to work, but now that they're shipping (bundling even) Garamond Premier Pro,
  it would make sense as a showcase feature.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I was both surprised
  and pleased to see this supported natively in the OS."

  body: "Raph, TrueType variations fonts have been around for a long time, but are
    not at all widely supported and there are few examples of them. They are considerably
    more versatile than MM fonts, and theoretically less work to produce. Another
    of Apple's brilliant ideas backed by a lack of implementation commitment. The
    necessary gvar and fvar tables are documented on the Apple font developer site:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6gvar.html\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6fvar.html\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the InDesign preferences option to automatically select correct optical size,
    this is actually an MM-specific preference, not an OpenType preference. I don't
    have any MM fonts with optical axes installed, so can't test it, but in theory
    it will select the appropriate instance to use. I don't know whether you need
    to have created such instances ahead of time, or if InDesign does it on the fly.\r\n\r\nThe
    OpenType size feature doesn't work anywhere, and is a really little more than
    an ugly hack of the OTL tables. David Lemon at Adobe mentioned last year that
    they are working on a spec for a new 'size' table, which would be welcome and
    a much better approach. Maybe now that the OT 1.4 spec is largely finished making
    its way through the ISO standardisation process we will see more work on a new
    version."

  body: "John: you rock. Thanks, that's <em>exactly</em> the information I was looking
    for.\r\n\r\nI'm all for refining the OT spec, but I don't see what's so terribly
    <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bbe4ce2\">wrong</a> with the
    size feature, or why it would be particularly difficult for Adobe to implement
    it (my guess is that the main issue here is knowing the grouping of the instances
    into one logical size-variant font, but in the worst case it seems to me that
    can be done heuristically from the names). The \"automatically use correct optical
    size\" feature (using MM variation) has been documented since InDesign 1.5 (update,
    according to Thomas commenting in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/3999\">this
    thread</a>, it's actually been there since 1.0)."

    be an exaggeration to say that we are working on something right now.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    TrueType font that ships in Mac OS X that includes variations -- it's Skia. Normally,
    AAT features are available through the system font selector -> Typography palette
    in applications such as TextEdit, Keynote, Pages and others. Note however that
    the standard Cocoa text API does *not* expose variations so these applications
    won't give you access to the variations. In order to see how the variantions work,
    you need to call ATSUI directly. There is a demo application that does that in
    the developer add-ins of Mac OS X (look for \"ATSUI\" there). \r\n\r\nA."
