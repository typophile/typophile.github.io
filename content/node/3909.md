  ALT="SIXTYSIX"> <BR>As you can see, they want a basic &#34;MOD&#34; flavor, and
  I was wondering <BR>what typefaces are appropriated for this period. Think Lambretta,
  Quadrophenia.... <BR>&#40;PS: SixtySix are nice people, not clients with business
  preoccupations&#41;'

    &#40;aka Zurich&#41;. <BR> <BR>with this family it&#39;s possible to experiment
    with lighter or bolder versions and the condensed - normal - expanded variations,
    too. '

  body: ' I agree w/ the &#34;cleaner&#34; fonts that have been suggested such as
    universe or the monoline one. I might also suggest a classic - frutiger.  <BR>Maybe
    the use of a clean and classic heavy serif font such as the clarendon is a great
    idea too if you are trying to stay &#34;period&#34; style. The logo - an awesome
    logo it is - is busy - so stay clean and clear with the supportive type. '
