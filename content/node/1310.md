body: Hi hhp,  <BR> <BR>recently you helped me with calculating an angle for a type.
  you talked about ratio &#40;?&#41; in stead of angles. <BR>Now I&#39;m working on
  a new type that has a 58 degree angle. does this make any sence, or should I take
  an other angle. could you help me out? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

  body: Finally, my college minor in Math pays off!  ;-&#41; <BR>Actually, this is
    more like junior high stuff. <BR> <BR>58 degrees?! Is that correct? Well, you
    take the tangent of 58 = 1.6003-whatever, which is about a 16/10 = 8/5 slope.
    But that translates back to ~57.9946 degrees, so sticking with 58 is really just
    as good in this case. <BR> <BR>But if you want a simpler/more_elegant slope you
    could use 3/2 which is 1.5, and the arc-tangent of that is about 56.3099 degrees,
    so use 56.31 and you&#39;ll get a nice two pixel move vertically for every three
    pixels you move horizontally, which means your line will have alternating two
    and one pixel steps. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hhp, I admire and thank you for that. I just can&#39;t do math. Perhaps it&#39;s
    very simple, but I just can&#39;t. <BR>I think I&#39;ll go for the 56,31 angle
    if you think that&#39;s better. I like elegance, therefor I think it&#39;s the
    better solution. <BR> <BR>Thanks a bunch. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: oeps, I made a mistake. I rotated the line from a horizontal position in stead
    of a vertical position. <BR>Now I have an angle from 31.5 degrees. Could you please
    recalc? <BR> <BR>Sorry for the bother. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: Of course, the &#34;measurement&#34; tool is only useful when you want to
    determine the angle in degrees for a previously known slope. <BR>If you have the
    degrees and want to find the slope, the only way is using the tangent.

    slopes- you could set up a background with rectangle of various [integer] proportions,
    and when you draw &#40;or paste&#41; the line at the angle you want, you can see
    which rectangle&#39;s corner it comes closest too &#40;and couple that with the
    notion that smaller recangles are simpler/more_elegant&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
