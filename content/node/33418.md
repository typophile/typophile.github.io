body: I've been given the wonderful task of chossing new fonts for  our company rebranding.
  Do any of you have any ideas of fonts that work good for mainly DM, Inserts, billboard,
  print ad formats. It's for a telecom company, large demographic range. Need creative
  help. Not a branding expert. :)

    What typeface is already incorporated?"
