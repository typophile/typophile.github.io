body: "I've been using Tribute a lot lately and found a character I didn't recognize.
  It's in the Italic face and is the Nr. character. I assume it's an abbreviation
  for \"number\" (like No.), but I wanted to consult with the experts.\r\n\r\nYou
  know what happens when people assume. Thanks for taking a look."

  body: "\"Nr.\" is the German equivalent of \"No.\" in English. Tribute was designed
    by Frank Heine (a German). See this [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No.|wiki article
    about \"No.\"]].\r\n\r\nThis is the second [[http://typophile.com/node/62727|German-specific]]
    font feature I've seen posted about today. "

  body: "Awesome. Thanks for confirming.\r\n\r\nI think it's a great alternate to
    the \"No.\" I think \"Nr.\" makes more sense, as there isn't an \"o\" in the word
    \"number\" (or nummer in the Germanic case).\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: The "o" in "No." is from the ending <em>-o</em> in Latin <em>numero</em>,
    meaning essentially "by number".
