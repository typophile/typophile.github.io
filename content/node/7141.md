  body: According to ATM it is an Image Club Graphics font, so I&#39;m not sure where
    you&#39;d get it from now.

  body: Omni was Image Club&#39;s simplified take on Optima, essentially it lacks
    the concavities on the vertical and horizontal strokes. For whatever reason, Agfa
    decided not to include Omni on Fonts.com after they purchased the Image Club library
    along with the remnants of the EyeWire site from Getty Images. <BR> <BR>The only
    place to obtain Omni today is to locate a used copy of Image Club&#39;s Letterpress
    CD &#40;which I happen to have a few of in my software archive&#41;. If you&#39;re
    interested in following this up, contact me through my <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&amp;profile=grant-users">Typophile

  body: My copy of Omni came from the Photoshop 5.5 &#34;Action Pack&#34;, an extra
    disc with clip art, stock photos, and fonts. There are a couple dozen ICG fonts
    on that disc.  You might be able to find a used copy somewhere.
