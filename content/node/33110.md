  a computer when I can ask some real typophiles? Does anybody know of any foundries
  or fontshops in Philadelphia? \r\n\r\nYes, it's a shame. I've lived here all my
  life and I don't know much about the industry here. Don't even get the feeling that
  there is one. Does anybody know? Where da typophillys at? Tryna' get in on the scene
  if ya know what I mean."

    let my foundry go comatose.  (Just brought it back.)

    scene is farther north or way out west.

  body: What about any type designers from philly? Am I wrong to assume that John
    Langdon is the only man practicing around here?
