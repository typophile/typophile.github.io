  body: Yup, can't find the right one. I've searched through so many handwriting fonts,
    and none of them work. I don't think it's a custom font.

  body: thank you for pointing out my misuse of term. I agree that it could be custom
    lettering, but I was hoping that I was wrong. Consider the thread closed, I'll
    make it up. Thanks everyone :)
