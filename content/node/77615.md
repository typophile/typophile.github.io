body: "Hello everyone, working a small project for a family friend. Company name is
  Elite Marble & Granite. Name pretty much what they do. They want to come across
  a professional and established company. \"Simple\" and \"Clean\" are the two most
  used words when describing the feel. Because of the name \"Elite\" I thought number
  1, top notch and royalty. I explored with granite slab idea in the #1. Three slabs
  making an \"E\" and crown. #2 takes on the \"number 1\" idea. Converted the \"I\"
  into a one and used a rectangle to show the slab of granite/marble. #3 is a play
  on the letter \"E\" and swirls of color/pattern variations in the stone work. #4
  focus on the royalty idea. \r\n\r\nHere are some first draft ideas. Do anyone of
  these jump out at you? Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elite_5740.jpg]"

  body: "Two and four are nice!  The third is too, but to me seems like it could be
    the logo for almost any company in America, and the swirly sphere looks too much
    like a bastard child of AT&T and Pepsi.\r\n\r\nIn number four, I would definitely
    raise the \"Marble & Granite\" so that it's closer to the \"Elite.\"\r\n\r\nGood
    start!"

  body: 'I guess #4 is my favorite, but all of these have a rather generic look. Would
    be nice if the logo related more to the marble & granite business, maybe through
    use of pattern, or representation of a tool (chisel?) or tiles of the material,
    etc. A quick Google Image search for "marble logo" or "granite logo" brings up
    examples -- some good, some terrible -- of logos that try to suggest those specific
    materials.'

  body: yeh, i started there too. Its's a fine detail type craft. the primary tools
    for granite/marble works are hand and laser cutters/sanders/buffers. nothing to
    exciting that's why i went more for the significance of the name and tie is with
    the granite/marble slab idea. I thought about drawing a figure of a man working
    on a slab, but that too seemed generic. Keep in mind the logo will be accompanied
    with marketing that suggests what they do on a more literal sense.

    bit too much like Adidas, and doesn't connote marble or granite to me."

    at it kinda looks like a pineapple or bee. =) thanks trevor.

  body: "First two look more like a castle tower to me. All three options have completely
    different feel to them. First is modern, last is (sort of) Las Vegas / discorama-ish,
    and the middle one looks like a much older logo tweaked to the modern age (I'd
    pick this one). \r\n\r\nWhich one works the best obviously depends on your client
    and what they are going for really.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd change, purely from the
    visual perspective, is to round E's top left corner. That straight angle really
    sticks out and IMO not in a good way."

  body: 'I agree. I feel like i''m all over the board. on the tower looking one, i
    was trying to make an ''E'' out of the shape and crown. also conveying slabs of
    granite/marble. the color version would probably aid this visual better. I''ll
    give the rounding of the E a try. Thanks apankrat. much appreciated. '

    the particular logo shown was meant for smaller-size reproduction, and thus when
    enlarged the register mark looks too big.  "

  body: okay. client picked this one. It came closes to a granite/marble installation
    type company. i'm having issues on what to do with the Marble & Granite line.
    Any ideas. Should it always be used with the name? I've been thinking of just
    using the mark and name on the business card and website. Thoughts? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_6244.jpg]

  body: "I don't lean toward any of these particularly but rather a combination of
    few:\r\n\r\n1. Take the lettering of #1\r\n2. Remove the symbol to the left\r\n3.
    Just take the crown from the symbol an put it on top of /E/ as you did #3 which
    is too playful and they don't make toys\r\n4. Set /Marble & Granite/ whole width
    and make it a bit more prominent - maybe even using tricks from #2 but I'm not
    too sure how to do it mayself (yet).\r\n\r\nDo not forget that this logo should
    be possible to be cut into marble/granite. Light type (especially /Marbe & Granite/)
    may be too problematic. Make it applicable for their business. What good would
    be a logo for i.e. fashion if it couldn't be sufficiently sewn on fabric?\r\n\r\nBut
    to look at all these I think that #3 and #4 are too playful for the business they
    do and don't work with this type.\r\n\r\nAs I said in AD3 to put the crown on
    /E/ I would also try putting it on the last /e/ which would balance the whole
    word as it gets smaller to the right because /e/ is not full high. Putting a ballanced
    subtle crown on it may help with that.\r\n\r\nedit: Sorry I just noted that this
    is a very old thread long gone and finished. Forget what I just said."
