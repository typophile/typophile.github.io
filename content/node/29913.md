  can write individual letters, scan them, send them back to the website and they'll
  make a font out of your handwriting?\r\n\r\nI did this a few years ago and was curious
  to find it again, but I'm not having luck.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    nice casual handwritten script. I don't think you'll get such even spacing or
    smooth character shapes from <a href=\"http://www.fontifier.com/examples.html\">Fontifier</a>,
