    the way: This font is for a course in my university. Im doing a new corporate
    identity for a roman germanic museum. This font should be used for the logo of
    the museum and its outposts. My teacher cant give me further corrections but I
    think that its not ready yet!?\r\nSo please feel free to comment. Any anwers are

  body: "Speaking of spacing, have you done tests using HH_HOHO_OO? Your \"O\"s seem
    way to airy and larger in size compared to the rest, The \"E\" seems to have a
    different SB than the \"H\" (look at \"THE\") and there seems to be a lot of weight
    balancing issues. I would like to see the letter combos in the HH...OO combo before
    I make a final comment. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, I think the diagonal are all
    too heavy(M,N,A,V), or the verticals are too light(H,L,) in the major stroke weight.
    \r\n\r\nAnd I think the secondary stroke weight for the \"A\" isn't working with
    the secondary strokes of the rounds like \"S\" or in transitions from round to
    vertical like the \"R\".\r\n\r\nDo you have unit numbers for these things? As
    much as type design is a creative discipline, it requires a lot of constancy and
    precision. "

    They may be owned by national, regional or local governments or be privately owned.
    Some museums address the history and artifacts of space exploration as well <a

  body: "edwin111 almost posted something relevant. Not a bad achievement for a spam
    bot, but that non-sequitur link is an instant tell.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely
    some spacing issues with the round letters, and the S looks too narrow among the
    rest. Of course this is all stuff from two years ago that was plowed up by a spam
    bot, so you may have resolved those issues long ago."

  body: "Jason is right; S looks too narrow, and so does L. To my eye, A, H, N and
    U are too wide. And the lower leg of K should bend in only one direction. Now
    it's sort of trying to go in both directions. I would make it bend down, and lose
    that start of a serif, just leave an angle at baseline or overshoot.\r\n\r\nThis
    is just after a quick look, but I see that you want to make a brake from Trajan
    style, with some hints remaining, and it pretty much works. Just don't over-do
    it."
