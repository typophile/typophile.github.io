    I can't remember. Maybe I can find it in tracking my own replies...\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Hmmm, that didn't work. Apparently it was during a gap in the re-titling
    of posts to show answers, so the name I was hoping to see as the answer did not
    show up.\r\n\r\nIt's a relatively new font, I think, but I cannot recall the name
    at all.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike,\r\nI guess you were thinking of this thread: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/70234\">A
    few Prince album fonts</a>.\r\nThe typeface would be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/envision/?refby=mfde\">Envision</a>.\r\n(I
    searched Typophile for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com/node%20Democratica%20Percolator\">Democratica
    and Percolator</a>.)\r\n\r\nNot a match for this one, however.\r\nF"

  body: "This is obviously based on the idiosyncratic [[Herbert Bayer]] design, like
    Jeanne Moderno is. See The Foundry\u2019s faithful rendition, <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_architype_2/bayer_type.html\">Architype
    Bayer-Type</a> (also no cigar)."

  body: "After seeing these choices I'm starting to feel that we are seeing a mix
    here. The Upper case seems to be from a Didot-style font, and the lower case,
    may be a blend of Jeanne Moderno and Architype Bayer-Type. I think the designer
    picked and chose to achieve an odd new combination. When this many of us can not
    get closer than we have, I suspect either custom or customized, and I include
    blending a mix of fonts as a customizing technique.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    it is indeed an exclusive design for Vogue, maybe by Austrian-American designer
