  body: Here is Wrigley and Wrigley Italic ... <BR>sorry for the poor scan, but I
    didn&#39;t <BR>want to crack the spine too much. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The nameplate has evolved over the years; <BR>if
    you look at the evolution, you can see <BR>that each time it&#39;s a custom job.
    Impact <BR>Wide is probably the closest thing going, <BR>nice spot Ryan. <BR>
    <BR>The nameplate is not set in Wrigley, but  <BR>Wrigley is one of the headline
    families, along <BR>with Carter&#39;s Georgia. <BR> <BR>Carter&#39;s Fenway is
    the SI text face. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63213.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>One clever and practical feature of the current logo: &#34;Sports&#34;
    slides left or right depending on the composition of the cover photo, and to accommodate
    snipes, banners, and all the other detritus of modern magazine covers.'

  body: The Wrigley family, as it&#39;s posted, isn&#39;t really used now, I just
    realized.  <BR>There&#39;s a grotesque that shares headline chores <BR>with Georgia
    ...but I am unclear whether it&#39;s called Wrigley. <BR> <BR>A friend of mine
    works at Sports Illustrated; he might be able <BR>to direct me to a person in
    the design department who might know more about the typography. <BR> <BR>bj
