body: The Santiago Canyon fire in Orange County came over the hill about a mile north
  of me. I didn't have to evacuate, but I was up until 4:00 a.m. this morning helping
  a friend evacuate from North Tustin.

  body: "I live in Rancho Santa Margarita and found two of my normal routes to work
    completely shut down. At approx. 8:30am, the fire was very close to where I live.
    You could tell by the way the clouds of smoke were coming off the hills. As I
    was making my way up the 5 north, ash was raining down on the highway and the
    air had that all too familar orange glow. I work in Anaheim and the winds are
    blowing all the clouds of smoke directly our way. It is very hard to walk around
    outside right now because of the smoke.\r\n\r\nStay safe, Gus."
