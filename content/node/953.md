  a custom quote for them for some fonts they&#39;d like to use for thier department
  and while it&#39;s a nice opportunity, it seems also riddled with problems. <BR>
  <BR>Here are some questions that came to mind: <BR> <BR>How many computers do they
  wish to put the fonts on? <BR>How many students enroll annually in your program?
  <BR>Will the students have access to the font files for use outside of school? <BR>How
  many years do they intend to use the fonts on your computers? <BR> <BR>Knowing that
  piracy is so rampant on college campuses, how can I willingly quote this knowing
  that my faces will be vulnurable to piracy? <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? '

    word-of-mouth, or would you prefer to sit by the fireplace with the sole copy
    of your precious design? Don&#39;t let your anger against piracy &#40;which is
    a &#42;certainty&#42;, btw, and really only a matter of degrees, in college or
    wherever&#41; cripple your productivity. Enough people are making that mistake
    already these days. <BR> <BR>Depending mostly on how much money they have and
    what size family they want, quote them somewhere between 2000 to 5000 US$, do
    it, and move on. If they want exclusivity, add anywhere between 50% to 100% to
    the price, depending on the duration. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    mechanisms they have in place to prevent font piracy among students? '

    misunderstood you: <BR>Does the school want a custom font &#40;what I thought&#41;,
    or a site license for some of your retail fonts, or what? <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' The school wants a site license for several of my retail fonts. I found
    out a few more details since my original post: <BR> <BR>These would be loaded
    on 22 computers &#40;PCs&#41; and would be used for a maximum of three courses
    a year at a maximum of 22 students/class. &#40;Typically only 2 of the 3 courses
    get enough enrollment to &#34;go&#34;. Typically, there are about 10 students
    in each course.&#41;  The fonts would not be made available to students for use
    outside of school. The fonts would probably be retired in three years along with
    the computers. <BR> <BR>I like many of the suggestions presented here. Overall,
    it&#39;s nice to understand the different directions I can take knowing where
    the fonts will end up before the license is created. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '
