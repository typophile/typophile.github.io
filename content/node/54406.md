body: "One thing has been buzzing in my head, since I read an opinion in [[http://typophile.com/node/54221#comments|my
  previous log entry]] about some glyphs of a font I'm developing.\r\n\r\nThe sharp-smart
  designer <strong>[[http://typophile.com/user/13487|Nina]]</strong> commented: <em>\u2018[...]
  the \u201Cn\u201D even seems narrow compared to the \u201Cm\u201D and the \u201Cu\u201D,
  the \u201Cm\u201D looking like it\u2019s about 2 units short of being a perfect
  duplication of the \u201Cn\u201D, and the \u201Cu\u201D almost exactly equal in
  width to the \u201Cn\u201D. Is that intentional?'</em>\r\n\r\nMy first answer and
  her bright reply [[http://typophile.com/node/54221#comments|are in the blog]], but
  it made me think about the \u201Chum\u201D question (it involved the \u201Ch\u201D,
  too) in the \u201Cn\u201D case, that is: how similar are these glyphs in their components
  compared to the \u201Cn\u201D.\r\n\r\nWell. I started to search for the way that
  different serif designs face the problem, and I noticed that criteria are quite
  uneven, but it is worth to attend to each one. \r\n\r\nAfter all, it is not matter
  of size (though some says \u201Csize matters\u201D) but of the overall look, and
  one must watch the typeface as a whole, regarding of its singular details.\r\n\r\nThe
  odd results of my experiment are showed below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The_n_case_4364.gif]\r\n\r\nPS:
  Fonts used for testing purposes were Baskerville, Big Caslon, Book Antiqua, Calisto,
  Caslon Pro, Century, Century Schoolbook, Cochin, Garamond Pro, Hoefler, Lucida Bright,
  Minion, Palatino and Times New. The small arrows point the shifts (meaning red:
  wider and green: narrower). "
