  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/isonorm-sb/|Isonorm]] is pretty
    close, but the corners of your sample are squared off and not rounded as in Isonorm.
    I guess it's possible that it is a customization, either a regular sans style
    with rounded terminals added, or a rounded font with some squaring added.\r\n\r\n-
