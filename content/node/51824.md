  be? Or where I might search for a font like this.\r\n\r\nIt's just so appropriate
  for a logo I'm working on -- friendly and retro, but strong, clean and legible.\r\n\r\nDo
  you think it was hand rendered?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arnolds_logo_4152.jpg]"

    of the letters that lead me to that conclusion. Plus the weights and x-heights
    are all over the place. But with open type I could end up with egg on my face
    as opposed to bread.\r\n\r\nMichael"
