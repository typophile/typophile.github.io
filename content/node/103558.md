    unusual for Dickinson to patent their faces, and I've not found it as uspto.com.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks, Anna\r\ntypeheritage.com"

  body: "Hi Anna, \r\n\r\nI did some further research. The results are not encouraging.\r\n_The
    Inland Printer_ published a specimen of Quaint Open from Dickenson in December
    1888 which includes the claim _patent applied for_. The Pettingill catalog of
    1901 -- source of the image I posted -- includes the claim _patented_. \r\nThe
    statement in my post that it was patented in December 1888 is from Loy's book
    _Nineteenth Century American Type Designers [2009]_.\r\nI went through the online
    design patents for December 1888, i.e. D18775 to D18830, but they do not include
    this patent. \r\nSo the patent date information from Loy is in error.\r\nPerhaps
    it was actually patented between 1888 and 1901. \r\nBut perhaps it was not, and
    the 1901 patented claim is a lie to intimidate competitors, a practice by foundries
    of the era. \r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi again Don,\r\n\r\nThanks a LOT for your super-quick legwork! I was excited
    when I read your first post\u2014before officially joining ATF in 1982, Dickinson
    personnel held only two design patents that I have verified:\r\n\r\n\u2022Norman
    Italic, Phemister et al. 1881 [USTPO D12235]\r\n\u2022Aesthetic, Phinney 1882
    [USPTO D13328]\r\n\r\nAs you so correctly observe, patent notices were often \"toothless\"
    warnings like \"beware of the dog\" when no dog existed. I suspect that the Dickinson,
    like the Central, TF adopted a legal-fee-beating policy of \"Skip the [expensive!]
    USPTO red tape/attorney fees. Instead, display a 'pending' notice. Our designs
    are so famous that no one would dare to sell copies of them.\" \r\n____\r\n\r\nBTW
    Loy did not consult USPTO design patent records. The info you read was researched
    for Johnston & Saxe by a woman duly acknowledged in their book *illustrating*
    his Inland Printer series (sorry, I can't find her name at the moment). \r\n\r\nRead
    his original article on J.F. Cumming [JFC] via the link here:\r\nhttp://typeheritage.com/jfc/jfc-02/\r\n\r\nThis
    chapter of my featured article on JFC may also interest you:\r\nhttp://typeheritage.com/jfc/03-patents/\u2014the
    nitty-gritty of who REALLY designed faces attributed to him...\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for your response, Don\u2014it's truly a treat to find a committed fellow type
    historian willing to explore beyond the \"easy [wrong!] answers\" so readily available
    from the online digital font giants that have acquired trademark ownership of
    letterpress faces originally designed in c1800\u2013World War I. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Anna"

  body: "Hi Anna,\r\nThanks for the kudos. I appreciate your shared interest in deep
    digging the facts on fonts where the provenance is lost in the mist of time.\r\nMy
    notes on the book include:\r\n    Loy's editors, Alastair M. Johnston & Stephen
    O. Saxe, researched the fonts produced by the designers and engravers profiled
    by Loy.\r\n... and for some reason I too did not write down the name of the actual
    researcher! Student? We DO tend to ignore the minions!\r\n\r\nLike you I got most
    of my patent info the hard way by digging at the USPTO. Learned a few quirks about
    PO examiner behavior in the 19th century. One is that the examiners sometimes
    let the font design applications pile up then cleared a group within a few days.
    So if I had a confirmed D-number or issue date I checked all of the D patents
    in a block of up to 50 before and after. Turned up a fair number not in Loy's
    book by this method. \r\n\r\nAs for who actually designed old fonts, I'll check
    your reference. I do know that Loy's book is about punch cutters, not designers.
    Sometimes they are the same, sometimes not. Some foundries allowed the designer
    or punch cutter to claim the patent & assign it to the foundry owner. Some owners
    took the credit directly. A few designers got the point where they did not have
    to assign. Sorting it out is a real forensic exercise!\r\n\r\nAnd as you note
    some foundries, like Bruce & MacKellar patented as policy, others did not. Almost
    nobody included full alphabets in their specimens. So we have to guess about the
    less frequent letters of unpatented fonts where old type fonts did not survive
    the modernizing purges by being purchased by Phillips -- his rare 1945 book is
    a goldmine -- or Solo, or being acquired by a type museum such as StBride or Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGreat
    fun.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
