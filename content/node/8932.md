  body: The two best ones I&#39;ve heard are by Weingart and GGL, the first saying
    something like somebody who uses Helvetica doesn&#39;t understand typography,
    and the second that it looks like a monster with a big torso and such. Exact quotes,
    anyone? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'About 5.5 years ago I had an allergic reaction to all the preposterous typeface-rationalization
    crap some people were coming up with, and wrote the below parody of two ficticious
    faces. <BR> <BR>Note: if you&#39;re in the middle of eating something you might
    want to wait... <BR> <BR>Regurgita embodies the ironic millennial paradigm shift
    <BR>that inescapably results from applying tomorrow&#39;s child-like <BR>vernacular
    meta-language to the form &amp; function of our <BR>technocratic past. <BR>By
    combining the progressive sensibilities of the Bauhaus <BR>with the palimpsest
    of Granjon &#40;a French punchcutter of aeons <BR>past&#41;, the letterforms of
    Regurgita tap into the psychosomatic <BR>turbulence of Humanity&#39;s future.
    <BR>And because Regurgita&#39;s forms each contain two levels of <BR>information,
    it is twice as readable. <BR> <BR>Helvomita carries Regurgita&#39;s spirit to
    the next level. It combines <BR>the alphabet with an anomalous biological process,
    yielding the <BR>typographic equivalent of partially-digested food coming out
    <BR>the wrong end. The question is, would you eat that? <BR> <BR>hhp'

    and his book <i>Grand</i> that denounced the typeface. I believe there were a
    number of interesting anti-Helvetica shirts offered on letterbox... I think.

    of the most successful typefaces ever. I meant that one cannot compare them, like
    apples and pears. Perhaps I used the wrong words to describe those two fruits,
