  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I immigrated to the US (California) a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;m looking for full time employment at a design agency, but the economy being what it is, I might have to do freelance work for a while. I have been offered a few local design cases, so I need to urgently figure out how to bill my clients. I&rsquo;ve lived in Europe all my life, so I&rsquo;m completely new on how to run my own small design business in America and the legalities involved. Do you have any suggestions where to start finding out about this? Is there an easy way to bill freelance work? What about setting up a small business? I am looking for a light and easy solution as my main goal is to join an agency. Right now I only need to have a proper way to bill my clients and to know how to file taxes for that. I just got an American social security number and am authorized to work here.</p>
<p>Also, do you have suggestions of a price range for hourly rates (freelance brand identity design, 5 years of experience, southern california).</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The SBA is a good suggestion, and you could also talk to an accountant for advice.</p>
<p>State Sales Tax &ndash; In some states, designers are required to charge state sales tax on their sales, and then pay the collected tax to the state periodically (usually monthly or quarterly). This can be a confusing situation as states usually have a list of which occupations need to collect sales tax, and design sometimes seems to fall into a gray area. Plus even if you do have to collect it, some of your clients may be tax exempt.  Check with an accountant or with the California department of taxation. (This is something that people doing an occasional freelance job don&rsquo;t bother with, but if it&rsquo;s how you make your living you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you&rsquo;re doing things legally.)</p>
<p>Business license &ndash; California may require you to get a business license; you&rsquo;ll need to check. (As with the sales tax situation, if you&rsquo;re just doing a few freelance jobs I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it, but if it&rsquo;s a full-time job I&rsquo;d make sure I was doing it legally.)</p>
<p>Federal Tax &ndash; If you&rsquo;re a U.S. citizen you need to file federal tax forms yearly (April 15). If you&rsquo;re self-employed you&rsquo;re supposed to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the government, so that by the end of the year you&rsquo;ve already paid most of what you owe. The amount you&rsquo;ll need to pay varies with your income bracket. See the IRS.gov site for more info.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hourly rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they are in California. Freelancers tend to be on the lower end of the scale, as clients know that a guy working out of his apartment doesn&rsquo;t have the same overhead as a multi-person design firm with offices. But it&rsquo;ll depend on your portfolio, reputation, etc.</p>
<p>Most clients will just want you to quote a flat price for a job. Be sure you get a clear understanding of what the job entails and put it in writing for their approval. List your fees and anticipated expenses. There are always going to be a few rounds of revisions with any job, so list them in your estimate (something like &ldquo;anticipated revisions &mdash; round 1 $x, round 2 $x, round 3 $x; actual amounts may vary depending on extent of revisions&rdquo;).</p>
<p>For freelance work, always ask for a portion (maybe 1/2) of the fee at the start of the job, and list the fee schedule for the rest (for example, 1/2 at start, 1/4 on delivery of concepts, and the final 1/4 on delivery of final art). You may need to do some negotiating and may have to compromise, but when doing a one-time job for a client who you don&rsquo;t know well, there&rsquo;s always the danger that they won&rsquo;t pay or will take 6 months to pay. Most folks are honest but you need to protect yourself.</p>
