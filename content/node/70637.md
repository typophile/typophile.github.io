  body: "It is better to make two threads, and also to use more descriptive titles.
    The album titles would have worked (you can edit the title since you were to one
    who started the thread).\r\n\r\n\"GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL\" is similar to MVB
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-aunt-mildred/\">Aunt Mildred</a>.
    The actual answer may turn out to be an amateur font from a freebie site.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes, I agree with Lex and Frode. There are many free sites for fonts where
    you might find something close to your \"GREAT SOUTHERN..\" font, but when we
    try to ID fonts we look for them where it is easiest to see selections based on
    styles or keywords, and we look for them where they can be licensed properly,
    not stolen, unless they were meant to be free fonts.\r\n\r\nI think you might
    just want to try designing a font before you complain about how much they cost.
    If you want hand-lettered fonts, that's easy to do, but anything else takes a
    great deal of skill and time, not to mention expensive design tools.\r\n\r\n-
