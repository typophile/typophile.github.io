    USD but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find it for free. <BR> <BR>I would
    maybe suggest using Impact &#40;usually comes with Windows&#41; and then condensing
    and skewing it. It won&#39;t look as good, but it&#39;ll be cheaper than spending
    $32 USD. <BR> <BR>Check out here: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/38604.html?1101045556"

  body: Abdul, since you are in school and don&#39;t have the money, stick with the
    junk you get at free font sites and leave the commercial fonts alone. Its only
    fair and not funny.

    <BR>Like instead of the next pair of fancy sneakers &#40;or iPod, or whatever&#41;
    spend money on fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp
