  and a few others, without any luck.  Can someone take a look at this logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Team-new-color-print_4313.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  idea what font this is?  I work for the station and I'm working on some material
  for some handouts, but no one seems to know the name of the font we used back when
  we created the logo. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nBrock"

    has a version called Adelon which comes in the right weight.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/adelon-serial/\r\n\r\nPS>
