body: Hello everybody <BR> <BR>i have just started to redesign a logo  <BR>for a &#34;chateau&#34;.
  The company is very famous  <BR>in Greece for their hotel in an amazing landscape
  <BR>in Chalkidiki &#40;northern Greece&#41;. Wine production  <BR>is a secondary
  activity of the company  <BR>and the &#34;chateau&#34; is placed in the same  <BR>landscape
  to the hotel. There is no need  <BR>to be a connection between the two -i just  <BR>mention
  the whole thing for the story. <BR> <BR>I tried to make the design as clearer i
  can,  <BR>though i kept all the basic shapes in the buildings  <BR>since i don&#39;t
  know how much i can omit. <BR> <BR>For the moment i prefer A though i am not sure  <BR>about
  the sizes &#40;that&#39;s why A1 and A2&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am looking forward for
  comments about  <BR>the typography and the clarity of the design.  <BR>I was trying
  to find a good combination to make  <BR>a ligature but i couldn&#39;t see such a
  case.  <BR>If anybody have a suggestion on it i will be  <BR>very pleased to know.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance and have you all a nice day. <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR><img

  body: I like very much the way that you have used the thinning lines to convey the
    landscape, but I wonder if the oval shape retained from the original isn&#39;t
    keeping the whole design somewhat rigid. Is that oval shape a requirement from
    the client? <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I don&#39;t like the versions with the borders
    around the image as I find that they make the design heavy. If pressed, however,
    I would prefer the borders in B, C, D and F because they mirror the lines in the
    image.  <BR> <BR>Generally I prefer the versions without the thin-thick line at
    the bottom as they are more open and welcoming, although the F and H are fun.
    My favourite example is G. <BR> <BR>I hope that these comments are helpful; I
    look forward to seeing the final decisions for this project.

  body: I like the logo without an oval border, and I  <BR>like the KAPPA? &#40;?&#41;
    with the swash K, like in  <BR>C,D,E. I also like KTHMA in italics, like in B.
    <BR> <BR>But these are the details and I think that you <BR>have the core of an
    excellent mark.

  body: Christos, you have made an excellent mark. Of those that you show here I like
    A2. No border on the oval and the double rule below the type looks both fresh
    and modern to my eye but also provides a nice foundation for the type. <BR> <BR>In
    general the oval is very active and is eyecatching. I wonder if the buildings
    could be simplified, removing the window details and providing a calmer centre
    like the pupil in the iris of an eye. <BR> <BR>No matter what, your revision of
    this mark is a huge step forward for the chateau. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Hello Christos, <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the oval works as
    well. I like the play between the curve of the edge of the  <BR>oval and the various
    straight lines. Were it bothers me is in how the oval shape isolates the image  <BR>from
    the type. <BR> <BR>Maybe it is just me, but I would put the type aound the oval
    &#40;like in the original&#41; as that would unify the  <BR>two, however I didn&#39;t
    want to suggest that when I put up my first post &#40;as I felt that it would
    not be  <BR>interesting for you to be too similar to the original&#41; so I wondered
    about modifying the oval instead. <BR> <BR>By the way, I like the modifications
    you made; they have lightened everything up considerably. <BR> <BR>The Italics
    in III are to my taste; they go very well with the other elements. <BR> <BR>Just
    a question, what kind of applications will this have other than letterhead etc.
    Will this be on signs,  <BR>wine bottles, menus?  <BR> <BR>And best of luck to
    the Greek team today! We will be watching from here &#40;if we can find space  <BR>in
    a caf

  body: Hello <BR> <BR>don&#39;t worry Robert and of course i didn&#39;t get you  <BR>wrong.
    I was wondering about the oval after  <BR>you mentioned it, so i tried different
    shapes. <BR> <BR>It was a good coinsidence because now that  <BR>i opened typophile
    to send them, i find your post. <BR> <BR>I think you are right about the type.  <BR>It
    works better in the way it is now. <BR> <BR>The sign will be applied on everything  <BR>you
    mentioned and even more... <BR> <BR>Thanks about the support but Czechs have a
    great  <BR>team. I hope we will win, but if not at least  <BR>the competitor is
    a worthy one. <BR> <BR>cheers, christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39734.gif"

  body: Wow, these look great! <BR> <BR>It occurs to me that by removing the &#34;sky&#34;
    the image has opened up, which really lets the  <BR>type into the image. It think
    that a version with a rounded bottom might embrace more the type  <BR>on top,
    but I like these versions too. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s funny, I wasn&#39;t partial to
    the swash caps in the previous versions, but I like them in this  <BR>latest post.
    I think that the angles of the swashes are working well with the lines in bottom
    right of  <BR>the image. But I find the middle version the most elegant typographicaly.
    <BR> <BR>This is really a beautiful project. I&#39;d stay at the chateau if I
    were in town... <BR> <BR>Robert

  body: This design has progressed very nicely, terrific job Christos. From your last
    posting I prefer the logo &#40;in the grouping of five with no type&#41; that
    is in the middle. It has the sky &#40;?, I thought it was more landscape&#41;
    and the land on the left breaks out of the rectangle shape. to me, it makes the
    overall design more interesting and dynamic. As for the type I like the version
    on the left, with the swash K&#39;s. One thing that looks off to me is the swash
    k next to the cap T and then small caps for hma. I don&#39;t read Greek so I&#39;m
    assuming that is gramitically correct, but how would it look with thma all in
    small caps?

  body: good morning. <BR> <BR>Robert and Kirsten i tried your suggestions.  <BR>
    <BR>Kirsten you are right that the &#34;T&#34; doesn&#39;t fit  <BR>to the &#34;K&#34;.
    Actually i was thinking about that  <BR>...i just needed someone to say it.  <BR>I
    also tighten the kerning and now i think  <BR>the swashes work better. <BR> <BR>Robert
    it seems your wish worked as we won  <BR>the Czechs yesterday. I have to admit
    that  <BR>they really were the best team in Euro 2004  <BR>but the psycology was
    with us &#40;around 15.000  <BR>Greeks were at the stadium&#41; and our defence  <BR>was
    strong. If i wasn&#39;t Greek i would support  <BR>the Czechs and even that i
    am pround we passed  <BR>on the other hand i feel sorry that  <BR>they didn&#39;t
    make it, because they deserved it. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback, au revoir

  body: You are right Ivan. There is a seashore in the original logo, but i decided
    to &#34;sacrifice&#34; it for the favor of simplicity &#40;or i didn&#39;t find
    a way to keep it&#41;. Of course if the client will insist on it i will have to
    find a way. <BR> <BR>...no more words about soccer. Not everybody share this discussion
    with the same pleasure... <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Regarding the sea--perhaps the straight lines at the left could be parallel
    curves? This would gently indicate the shore but not become too important.  The
    2 sets of straight lines now seem to be attacking a fort. <BR>I like the last
    2 in &#34;C&#34; best. Perhaps the length of the curved type &#34;Porto Karras&#34;
    could equal the width of the drawing.  The word &#34;KTHMA&#34; could be smaller,
    lighter, and wide letterspaced to also equal the width of the drawing? <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    i disagree with the need to fix everything in the same width first because i think
    it will be so over-symmetric for my taste and second the letters will be very
    small. About the contrast i prefer to keep the lc italics as in B2 and C2 &#40;i
    think i will keep C2&#41;. <BR> <BR>Good day to all, christos'

    perspective change between the two towers. The tall tower looks like it is falling
    to the right. I think it will need to be flatter on top &#40;showing less of the
    back wall. Either that, or the tower with the roof may need to show more roof.
    Speaking of this roof, did you try the left side dark and right side light '
