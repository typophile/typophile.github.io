  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was wondering a couple of days ago if there has been variations in the size of book types trough history. <BR> <BR>I have the impression that typefaces of the XV and XVI centuries were printed in sizes of about 14 points, and read somewhere that during the XIX century mondern types were frequently printed in sizes of about 7 or 8 points. <BR> <BR>I know that today nobody would think of setting a normal book page in sizes as extreme as 7 or 14 points, but what about 100 or 400 years ago? <BR> <BR> <BR>BTW, I just found out that the first fully digital typeface was Hermann Zapf's Marconi in 1976 (according to Gerard Unger: <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns04.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns04.html">http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns04.html</a></a>)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the book <em>Counter punch</em> there is a reference to the earliest cutting of very small text size faces. <BR> <BR>Since book work is determined by conventional parent paper sizes, today and to some extent, always, there is only a certain range of point sizes that are appropriate. Early paper sizes were regulated in regard to size based on previous formats, which were based on the size of animal skins, e.g., goats, calves. An elephant folio sheet was one entire animal. Uterine calf was used for miniatures (both mother and unborn were sacrificed). The monestaries dedicated to scribal work were mass slaughterhouses, but set the standard that we still abide by. <BR> <BR>14-point is hardly an extremely large size however. The fine printer-publisher William Everson, who worked in larger format, recommended 16-pt as the ideal size for bookwork. Victor Hammer often worked at the larger end of the spectrum as well. There is some validity in this as most faces do seem to show their form best at larger sizes. This may be more a fine press/letterpress thing though. Fairly large text sizes are much more friendlier in regard to presswork. And, then there is the market as well; larger format books tend to have a higher selling price and are more likely to attract collectors.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some of the finest printing from small type, in very small pocket books, was done by the Elzeviers in the late 16th and 17th centuries. They also produced books at larger sizes, using larger type, up to folio size, but their small books are justly admired. The body type is usually about equivalent to 7pt or 8pt.</div>

&ldquo;Mut zur Typographie&rdquo; by Jürgen Gulbins and Christine Kahrmann, p. 281 
there is a table with names and point size both in didot points (the &ldquo;new didot&rdquo; 0,375 mm) and the corresponding value in DTP-points (1/12 inch = 0,3528 mm) (there is also a row in Pica-Points with 0,351 mm I omit here):<br><br></p>

I tried to give a translation of some of the names (second row). I don't know if the actual size of type has been different due to the different units in american type. If this would be true an american "nonpareil" would differ in size from a german "nonpareil". But of course an old "Minion" with 7 didot-point was bigger in size than our 7 dtp-point. To get a "Minion"-size we ought to set in 7,44 pt (and of course depending on the actual shape of the glyphs on the body).</div>

I think though that your point about its typographic colour and the incidence of vowels is the result of how easily it can thus be hyphenated (and its differing rules regarding hyphenation), with the consequence that word spacing can be uniformly tighter. This is not the case with roman languages derived from Latin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, although this had changed by the time of the Elzevier editions referred to above, and most scribal abbreviations were abandoned. The point about hyphenation and evenness of word spacing is well made, but I think there is also a simple pleasantness in the frequency of certain letters and repetition of combinations in Latin. I recently set a bi-lingual Mass booklet for a friend's ordination, using the Dante types, and the Latin columns look much more magesterial than the English (in part, I admit, because Latin is a more efficient language, so I had to use a smaller point size for the English).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wasn't solely responsible for the ordination booklet, and it was somewhat hastily completed, because the final text revisions arrived a short while before we needed to go to print. Fr Joseph had originally been hoping to include the chant setting in the booklet, but in the end this needed to be printed on a separate folded sheet, because we didn't have time to get it typeset before the deadline for the booklet. It isn't perfect by any means: there are a couple of mistakes in the text, and some instances of less than ideal justification, but it made a good impression on the day. Some of the visiting FSSP clergy noted that it was better typeset than their missals. <BR> <BR>I decided to go for quite a large format, to keep the number of pages down and because we knew there would be a lot of elderly people in the congregation who would appreciate the decent size of the type. <BR> <BR>Here are a couple of PDFs.

On the negative: Everybody always does his part in the last minute. Blame myself too of course. <BR> <BR>I like the printing in two colours - a good tradition of missal typesetting. <BR>Unfortunately in our church there often is not enough money (or not enough care for liturgical capability to spend it) to work like this. <BR> <BR>The distinction between &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;old fashioned&quot;: Unfortunately my english is not so good to understand which implications you have - but it also may be in the words themselves: Which do you regard as better? <BR>Here in Germany with good traditions lost due to Ultramodernism (I mean thinking that <i>all</i> old things are bad and <i>everything</i> new is entirely better, but that results to a good part from a very difficult relationship to history and the shadow of evil that has fallen on it), and now seeking for traditions that are able to take a weight (especially in parishes), everything is called &quot;traditional&quot; that has been done twice. Even if no one carries/trades that &quot;tradition&quot;. <BR> <BR>I will post an example of missal booklet from me. <BR> <BR>I would find it a very interesting thread of its own: <BR>&quot;Missal (booklet) typography&quot; <BR>because there are interesting questions about setting the different types of text and dealing with tradition, readability and even dignity of words and also the influence of social atmosphere. <BR>How make a modern, open, visual skilled booklet keeping long time weight of words? How to integrate explanations? And so on. <BR> <BR>Back to the setting of Latin: <BR>I think its evenness is in the rhythm of the language. There is a clear difference in the visual form of latin text in whole sentences (with very very few capitals) and the passages where a lot of Names with capital first letters and a different distribution of consonants/vowels occur. <BR> <BR>Gesegneten Sonntag!

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the distinction between traditional and old fashioned. Especially in the context of religion, I take an etymological stance on tradition: always remembering that it is from the Latin verb <i>traditio,</i> to hand on. Tradition is all about passing on of something of inherent value from one generation to another. Conversely, old-fashioned implies simply doing something superficially in the way it used to be done, without critically considering whether the thing has inherent value. The kind of ultramodernism to which you refer is similarly uncritical, in that it tends to treat all tradition as if it were merely a matter of fashion and taste, and not of inherent value. Some traditionalists, of course, make the opposite mistake, and in their fervour to defend tradition against modernist or post-modernist assault will adopt a reactionary position that clings to anything old-fashioned as a kind of reassurance. It seems to me that the only healthy position in all these options is that of true tradition: which requires a critical consideration of both past and present, but with dutiful acceptance of what is handed to us, maintaining it and handing it on in our turn, <i>and erring on the side of this </i>traditio<i> if we are uncertain about or unable to understand the value of what we have been handed.</i></div>

I was very sleepy when I wrote that, having stayed up the night before to watch the live feed of the Pope's innaugural Mass, itself a study in both tradition and innovation. Watching Benedict XVI and the eastern rite patriarchs incense the tomb of Peter before the Mass, it was difficult to believe that this is a new addition to the innauguration of a Pope, which has never been included in the ceremony before: it is an innovation that joins to the tradition without the seams being visible.</div>
