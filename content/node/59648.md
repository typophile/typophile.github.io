body: "I am nearing completion on a display face I would like to offer in both a merged/solid
  option and broken-apart/two-layer option. I have generated the three font files
  (solid, layer 1, and layer 2) with identical vertical metrics. When I typeset text
  boxes on top of each other to test the alignment, layer 2 lines up properly on top
  of the solid font, but layer 1 is set at a slightly higher baseline.\r\n\r\nSearching
  past threads, I found this post by Nick Shinn from a couple years back where a similar
  problem was being dealt with. However I could not find an answer. I have also tried
  John Hudson\u2019s how-to on vertical metrics and Adam Twardoch\u2019s guide in
  Learn FontLab Fast for setting metrics for type families but have failed to fix
  this problem.\r\n\r\nBelow are screenshots of the relevant Font Info metrics panels
  for the three fonts:\r\n\r\n<strong>Solid</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_solid_4672.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Layer

  screenshot illustrates the issue I'm facing. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_4095.jpg]\r\nThe
  left shows Layer 1 misaligned atop the Solid font; the right shows Layer 2 working
  just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone could throw me a technical life preserver on this,
  I would be greatly appreciative. Some notes: working with FL5 on Mac OS 10.4 (Intel);
  alignment problem occurs in Illustrator and Photoshop CS2, but not InDesign CS2;
  generated fonts are OT PS.\r\n\r\n*hhea table metrics inconsistency has been corrected

    I have corrected this within the Layer 1 font but continue to experience the misalignment

    slightly. It\u2019s the half of the edge of the triangle. I notice, that the sum
    of WinAscent and Win Descent (or Ascender and Descender) is bigger than the Font
    BBox height (1224); is this allowed? I am not sure. And the solid style minus
    the layer 2 style is the layer 1 style. I can imagine, that this subtraction has
    cut a key glyph, Photoshop or Illustrator uses for alignment, at the top. I am
    speculating, hope this is okay. I think, that I would test the font with a very
    basic character set; I mean, that I would remove first most characters from the
    font. Do you have tested it with the b as the only glyph, that is contained in
    it? For the case, that the different height of a key glyph is the cause, I would
    try to insert a mini dummy outline (which is likewise a triangle, but with an
    edge length of round about 1 unit, isn\u2019t it?) into the key glyph."

  body: "Arno: thank you for your response. You're correct\u2014perhaps 'slightly'
    is a bit of an understatement. I will look into setting the WinAscent/Ascender
    and WinDescent/Descender values so that their sum are equal to or less than 1224.\r\n\r\nHere
    is how the three font files were created: 1) I made an <em>unmerged</em> font
    for production that contained all triangles (both those of layer 1 and 2) as separate
    contours; 2) I merged all contours into individual characters, creating the solid
    font, adjusted metrics, kerning, and hinting; 3) imported the metrics from the
    solid file into the original unmerged production file and deleted triangles in
    each character to form the layer 1 and 2 font files. Which is to say, I did <em>not</em>
    create one of the layer files, then use a transformation or contour substraction
    to yield the other layer file. I'm not sure if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
    for what to start with in terms of a basic character set for doing a diagnostic?"

  body: "Having the OS/2 Win- metrics values sum to greater than the bbox is permitted,
    although Adobe avoid doing it. There are circumstances in which it is desirable,
    notably if one is releasing a font that is liable to be extended in future with
    additional scripts or stacked diacritics, and you want to be able to maintain
    metrics compatibility. In that case, it makes sense to build some leeway into
    the Win- metrics.\r\n\r\nHowever, if an application is using the bbox to calculate
    vertical alignment, which it might do for the first line in a text block, then
    the font with shorter descenders will be raised, as shown. One way around this
    would be to create a dummy glyph in the font that is the same height as the ascender
    in the taller fonts, e.g. the height of your Solid and Layer 1 b. This will make
    the bbox values compatible."

  body: "John\r\n\r\nThe height of the bbox in Andy\u2019s fonts already is the same.
    (The bbox values cannot be edited like Ascender, Descender and so on.) That\u2019s
    the reason, why I wonder, whether Illustrator and Photoshop CS2 calculate the
    alignment with the help of a key glyph in the font, the letter H for example.
    In this case you had to make the key glyph heigher, which could be done by adding
    a useless node over the top of the key glyph. Does a single node violate the specifications?
    A single node or two connected nodes would be optimal, because they are unvisible.
    If two nodes are not permitted, I would create an outline, that is as small as
    possible. I think, that is a triangle with an edge length of 1 unit. Such a triangle
    is even not visible at 512 zoom size (points?) in FontLab. Nevertheless this would
    be a dirty solution.\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n<cite>Any suggestions for what to start

    there is a key glyph, that Photoshop CS2 or Illustrator CS2 use for alignment,
    I doubt, that this glyph is not in the alphabet (without diacritics). I can imagine,
    that it is the H. (Edited: It can\u2019t be the b, because its height is the same
    in solid and layer 1.) If the different alignment remains, after you have removed
    all glyphs, except from the alphabet, I would remove the small letters additionally
    and test again. Something like that. But make sure, that you don\u2019t change
    the bbox height, when you remove the glyphs. So keep a glyph, that is not in the
    basic alphabet and make make sure, that its height is 936 units in all three fonts."

    If you type text without a frame, it does not appear. And if there is a key glyph,

  body: "Andy\r\n\r\nI think, that I have solved the problem: The small d is the key
    glyph. I have added a horizontal line, which is an open contour, to all characters
    d of my test font family except from the d, that is the highest one in my test
    font family. The line, that I have added is in the same height as the highest
    d in the family. When you generate the Font, FontLab grumbles. Ignore it. Maybe
    there is a cleaner solution. I am not sure, if this has any negative side-effects.\r\n\r\nMay
    it be, that the d of your solid style is a b, mirrored at the vertical line? I
    ask, because otherwise the layer 1 d would probably also have the same height
    as the solid d.\r\n\r\nNote, that not your font is the problem (in my theory).
    All fonts, in which the small d has another height as the other styles in the
    font family (measured from the baseline to the top), show the same problem in
    Photoshop and Illustrator.\r\n\r\nEdited:\r\n\r\nJust save the following code
    as eps file and drag the eps file to the d-character. FontLab will not grumble,

    the first line in a text frame with the help of the height of the character d.
    So the heighest point of the d is always in the same height as the text frame.
    (And it seems to compute the height for the actual text size, which can result
    in a one pixel rounding error.) It simply does not use any of the values stored
    in the font for aligning the first line. So I doubt, that the manipulation of
    the bbox values will help here. But it is nevertheless a useful tip, which might
    solve other problems with alignment and leading.\r\n\r\nOff topic: Have a look
    at <a href=http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html;msg23929#msg23929>my

    naming tutorial.\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\nPhotoshop CS3 renders the aligner, but I assume,
    that Photoshop CS2 also does it. It probably is dependent from the text size,
    in which you test. Imagine, that the aligner has no content. At least I thought,
    that a line with a height of zero does not have content. So it may help to double
    the aligner and change the path direction of the aligner, which is on the top.
    I want to test that. But even if it works, now I cannot exclude anymore, that
    there are negative side effects. The way, in which Photoshop aligns the first
    line, is the problem, not your fonts."
