  it with other designers. The reoccuring question is: What did she mean graphic design
  is about:  <BR> <BR>Data -&#62; Information -&#62; Messages of meaning <BR> <BR>as
  opposed to <BR> <BR>Information -&#62; Messages of meaning <BR> <BR>If you could

    of being informed; communication of knowledge: Safety instructions are provided
    for the information of our passengers. <BR> <BR>You wouldn&#39;t say, &#34;...for
    the data of our passengers.&#34; Information can carry the implication that it
    is being communicated, while &#34;data&#34; just sits on paper, waiting to be
    analyzed. <BR> <BR>Data, Information, and Message might also be broken up into
    Observation, Interpretation, and Application. Data is gathered, the information
    is deciphered, and it is tailored to apply to a certain target audience.'

  body: Your information has to come from somewhere. Sometimes the information you
    recieve needs to be reprocessed or rewritten in order to create an effective message.  <BR>
    <BR>I participated in a workshop with her a year ago and one of her biggest points
    centered around a very early project of hers. If I remember correctly it was a
    guide for janitors on how to perform certain cleaning tasks. There was a big problem
    with people mixing cleaning chemicals. <BR> <BR>She reluctantly showed us slides
    of the final piece, which were very clean and modern&#40;ist&#41; in appearance.
    By all standards of visual quality, it looked very nice, a very good example of
    information design.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, the janitors kept screwing up and
    mixing chemicals and the project was unsuccessful. She realized a few years later
    that it was unsuccessful, in part, because it was very dry and boring. The modernist
    visual style and the formality of the instructions were so disinteresting that
    none of the janitors read it.  <BR> <BR>In rethinking the project she concluded
    that if she were to have reworked the information to appeal to the specific audience
    of janitors they might have actually read it. She showed an example of a student
    project from somewhere that used a comic book format and said that it would have
    been more effective communication solution for the project than her original modernist
    solution. I&#39;m not saying I agree with her but maybe her example will help
    you understand what she means when she differentiates between data and information.

    <BR> <BR>A scanner can do that job. <BR>Put man back into graphics for the sake
    of heaven ! <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s tad too hardcore but I stick with what Mr.
    Jef Raskin <BR>wrote : &#39;Information cannot be designed; what can be designed
    <BR>are the modes of transfer and the representations of information.&#39; <BR>
    <BR>__ Observation, Interpretation, and Application.__ <BR> <BR>Brian, I like
    what you wrote very much.  Writing &#39;deciphered&#39; <BR>you are &#39;hiding&#39;
    the word &#39;code&#39; which is about &#39;symbols&#39; <BR>&amp; &#39;electricity&#39;
    -- uhh, that&#39;s tough, that the challenge <BR>&amp; my my 2 cents, for what
    it&#39;s worth. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>AS'

  body: In my understanding, data is just raw numbers. Information implies the intervention
    of the human hand/mind to focus and represent a specific set of data to make it
    meaningful. The &#34;messages of meaning&#34; is how we make the information relevant,
    accessible, and meaningful beyond the implied meaning. The janitor story that
    Jackson gave is a quintessential example. <BR> <BR>I think she includes the &#39;data&#39;
    step to remind us that we typically receive pre-digested/sorted/interpreted content
    before we add our own spin. It&#39;s that spin that separates us from accountants&#40;?&#41;.

  body: There are some interesting interpretations of a potentialy ambiguous quote.
    My own conclusion was that the data represents keywords given to us by the client
    to solve a design problem. We act as the mediators of information but the data
    is the essence of WHAT needs to be communicated.

  body: 'No doubt I&#39;m missing the mark entirely here &#40; I frequently do&#41;
    but this quote makes me instantly think of the process I go through when designing
    graphs and charts for annual reports. I&#39;m provided with pure data: lists of
    potentially meaningless numbers in Excel files. They mean nothing to me. I have
    to translate this into information &#40;quality, quantity, for example&#41; and
    then further translate that information into a graph or chart that communicates
    the main point as clearly &amp; simply as possible &#40;eg: if &#34;x&#34; is
    this low, we&#39;re stuffed. Or &#34;y&#34; is this much '
