  body: "I just spoke to the people at Foundry, and they say that Foundry Architype\u2019s
    Bayer Type doesn't have capital letters: \"no \u2013 it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it
    is a single alphabet in accordance with it\u2019s origination\".\r\n\r\nPlus,
    Foundry Architype\u2019s Bayer Type seems more condensed than what I can see in
    the above jpgs. On top of that, the l, t, w, etc. aren't the same...\r\n"

    a exclusiv design for the magazine, based upon an exixsting font. Perhaps Architype's
    Bayer.\r\nSorry if I hadn't answered you before, I was away. \r\n\r\nThank you
    very much!\r\nEliane"
