  body: The Coca Cola core brand logos are custom designed,  <BR>so I don&#39;t know
    whether you&#39;ll get a match. I&#39;ll have  <BR>a look for similar stuff if
    I find some time tomorrow.

  body: I think it&#39;s a modified version of Adobes ITC Berkely Bold Italic. The
    script &#34;O&#34; is custom along with the &#34;C&#34; from the old branding
    but I&#39;m almost positive they&#39;re based off of that font. <BR>kfur
