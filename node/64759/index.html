  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In my opinion, although it is very early in its lifetime to say this, I suspect that the popularity of Times Roman bids fair to endure nearly as long as that of Caslon.

Of course, there was Stanley Morison's own famous comment on that font:

<em>As a new face it should, by the grace of God and the art of man, have been broad and open, generous and ample; instead, by the vice of Mammon and the misery of the machine, it is bigoted and narrow, mean and puritan.</em>

Yes, it has short descenders and a large x-height, but not so much so as Corona, for it was designed originally for use in a newspaper, albeit one printed with more care, and on better paper, than the typical North American newspaper.

An alternate version of Times with long descenders was offered for a while by one founder (I think Monotype itself); it was made to match regular Times in size, which meant that leading was obligatory, as it was still cast on the body of its nominal point size - the long descenders became vertical kerns. I don't know if it was ever digitized.

But my question is this: given the popularity - and evident merits - of Times Roman, why hasn't someone (or has someone, outside of my meagre knowledge) produced, as it were, a "Times Book" in which not only the descenders are lengthened, but so are the ascenders (slightly), with the lower case reduced slightly in size relative to the upper case so as to moderate the x-height to a "normal" value, and the stroke widths then also adjusted (made heavier in the lower case, or lighter in the upper case, or both, so that the ratio between them remains at the appropriate value)?

Times is a beautiful font, but if those characteristics of it which save on paper (the vice of Mammon perhaps becoming the virtue of wise stewardship of our forests) can fairly be recognized as a problem, why can't this problem be solved, so that the fullness of the beauty of Times may be appreciated - and the spirits of both Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent find peace?</div>

Times is classic Dutch book type adapted for newsprint. Why would anybody bother reversing the process? There’s hardly a shortage of good Dutch book faces out there already.</div>

I do think, though, that Times Roman isn't <em>just</em> an adaptation. Even compared to Plantin, it has just that extra little bit of zing - by sharpening the serifs, as Caslon did - and so it isn't entirely beyond imagining that for some, nothing less than a book-ified Times would do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Times Roman actually works quite well in books. But its proportions aren't those of a classic book face, and so even Stanley Morison himself has criticized it.

Since the "flaw", if flaw it is, of a large x-height is so easy to correct, I had wondered why this had not been done.

But then I came across the font New Aster, designed by Simoncini for Linotype, which seems to be rather close to what I was thinking of. Or perhaps I've just been confused about what the x-height of Times is.</div>

Indeed, very, very early. You may have to bequeath your great grandchildren's grandchildren the link to this discussion for them to ascertain any truth in this statement.

Today there are so many excellent book faces in their own right that it seems almost embarrasing to drag Times into their company.</div>

What's this Nina, <em>reductio ad Aachen</em>? 

There are many ways to categorize any font.
We're talking about a face, designed for an upscale newspaper, that has become the most-used, most-read face in book publishing. It seems absurd to not consider it a book face, amongst its many other uses. 

Morison's antipathy represents the hypocritical snobbery that exists within the type and design world, looking down upon the "trade" work that most of us must do to make a living--serving mammon--while we admire work that is more refined and "creative". But he was mistaken about the rudeness of Times: it was used as the text face of the Penrose annual for many years, during his lifetime, in an open, generous and ample layout. Apparently, it passed muster with his peers.

There is no reason "classic" (hardcover) book faces need have a small x-height and supposedly aristocratic proportions. Dante, for instance, is quite proletarian in that respect.

		<div class="commentbody">Frankly, I wouldn't be above typesetting a book in Corona. But my reasons would not be entirely "mean and puritan"; rather than trying to save trees, it would be because the face was once so familiar - and still blends familiar ingredients and proportions - that it might be more nondescript than Century Expanded, and thus better approach the worthy ideal of the "crystal goblet".

But snobbery though certain things may be, I'm not sure it's hypocritical. Designing Paragon and Aurora and Excelsior and Corona... yes, it was a living, but as a post here noted, designing the TTS legibility fonts was more "work" and less "fun" than working on something that would be more creative, more of a labor of love.

Thus, cutting Jenson Oldstyle or Poliphilus - that's the sort of thing a type designer wishes to get to do when he gets to the top of the field. That's what will be acclaimed and remembered when rubber rollers on stereotype presses become museum pieces.

It's not hypocritical to pay one's rent by doing the work that one can find, or to prefer to be doing something more creative. That's true in technical fields as well as artistic ones.</div>

Under certain circumstances you might have to do even worse.

I've seen books 'typeset' in communist countries --I'm thinking of Cuba in this particular instance-- where the setting itself is nothing more than pages banged up on 1950's typewriters, reduced to the final book size. Awful doesn't even begin to describe it. One can only pity those who are obliged to use such books.

I'm sure that gently scolding those who produce books this way cannot be construed as snobbery nor hypocrisy. As typographers, one is just upholding over 500 years of tradition while at the same time showing that we've learnt a thing or two along the way.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, maybe language is a bit too imprecise here. To me a font being a "book face" would primarily mean "a typeface designed for books" and [somewhat] optimized for that purpose. Now maybe a font could be a "book face" as well as something else; but if on the other hand you take "book face" to mean "a typeface used in books", then that can really be anything. Which makes the term kinda useless in my book (sorry).

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that Times New Roman is a great typeface, with many assets. 

As Mark said, it is extremely compact, which makes it good for shorter columns--newspaper and magazine columns, paper backs. Also of compact types it combines being dark, readable at small sizes, and clean all at the same time. 

Whoever did it basically took a large x-height Dutch type and put sharp, lapidary serifs, like Gill's Perpetua, on it instead of the slabby originals. This worked very well, and it is hard to beat for compact, short printed columns at small size. 

However, to me it is a little too compact for ideal comfort in reading. Also its sharpness and compactness has a certain kind of "I'm all business" aesthetic about it that I don't think is best for many uses.  

At long measure, such as in a single column on letter size or A4 paper with narrow margins, it is pretty much of a disaster. </div>

No it's not, if those two situations are considered separately; but the connection between them is tenuous.
It's hypocritical to assert that one's rent-money work is inherently inferior, or that one's work which achieves popular acclaim is thereby second rate.  

Further on Morison's hypocrisy: he was happy to take the acclaim for having excogitated Times, although it is now understood that he swiped the design from Starling Burgess and Victor Lardent did all the work.

<em>Thus, cutting Jenson Oldstyle or Poliphilus - that’s the sort of thing a type designer wishes to get to do when he gets to the top of the field.</em>

A bit of a generalization. I suspect that more of us take a crack at reviving Jenson early on.
And if you made it to the top and wanted to leave your mark on history, surely doing something original would make more sense than a revival?
BTW, Poliphilus wasn't designed or "cut": it was pure concept, a photo-facsimile.

Times has almost the same vertical proportions (cap to x-height ratio) as Minion, a face that has become quite popular and respected for book and text work in general. Is Minion, too, not really a "book" face, because of its x-height? (Don't tell Robert Bringhurst!)

Minion's x-height is notably smaller* plus its forms are much wider.

I think all three (cap height, extender height, descender length) are relevant to x-height.

However, isn't it true that in typography we normally discuss x-height in relation to cap height, and extender length in relation to x-height? In other words, we say that a typeface has a small x-height if it is small in relation to cap height. But if it is small in relation to extender length, we don't say that it has a small x-height, rather, we say that that the font has long extenders.

Therefore, it is correct to say that Times has a large x-height and short extenders; and that Minion has a large x-height and long (er) extenders. What you are saying, Hrant, is that any typeface with long extenders has a small x-height, according to which logic Minion does not have a large x-height. But if you ask typographers about Minion's x-height, I think the consensus would be that it is medium to large, because they will compare it to cap height. Duh.</div>

Frankly, I don't know of that convention of defining one via the other and not the other way round. But if that is indeed so, it seems (a) a bit arbitrary, and (b) not very helpful, at least when discussing readability: How relevant is cap height to reading, compared to extender length? Not very, I would surmise, at least not if you're typesetting English. So doesn't it just make more sense to talk about x-ht/extenders?</div>

That's like saying an airplane gets more traction than a car because its wheels are relatively smaller than a car's. It ignores almost everything that matters.

A setting of Times looks nothing like a setting of Minion, and that's due largely to the latter's x-height being much shorter and wider, not compared to the caps but compared to the vertical span of the bulk of text.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the most useful measure of size of x-height for the sake of type discussions is the percentage of the em. For then you can specify caps, ascenders, descenders etc independently in relation to that as well. 

However, as 95% plus of type in extended type is lower case, the relationship between the x height and the ascenders is visually the most significant figure for aesthetics and possible affect on readability. 

The actual affect of x-height on readability I think is pretty hard to pin down, in a case when differences are as small they are between Minion and Times New Roman. 

The difficulty is that the overall readability is, as Nick is fond of pointing out, a matter of the overall setting. If you have short columns tightly set at 10 point, then Times might win. If columns of a somewhat longer measure set at 11 point with a little more leading, then Minion might win. But we don't have any good measures yet anyway.

Further, as Hrant points out, the width and color of the type are also important variables. These may not be independent factors in readability, but interact with x-height/ascender-height ratios. </div>

I agree with Hrant, Nina, and Bill, that the relationship between ascender height and x-height is the most significant.
However, that is NOT the way that x-height proportion is generally defined, e.g. TypoWiki:

"The x-height is measured as a proportion of the total cap height. A typeface is said to have a large x-height when the lowercase x is relatively tall compared to the capital X. A typeface is said to have a small x-height when the lowercase x is relatively short compared to the capital X."

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Nick, the x-height in a piece of metal is a fixed number, however many fractions of an inch or how many millimeters. When we go to digital type, because it is scalable, I think it is preferable to compare the x-height to the em. Then, for example, you can speak of how sizes of x-heights compare across fonts, and when they match in setting on one line. If you pin the comparison in relation to either the cap height or ascender height, you lose that. Also in the font itself the x-height is actually a number in units based on the em. So I think the Typowiki would better define size of x-height as percentage of the em, rather than the cap height.

This is a problem because a user can choose any point size and he often does this to compensate for a size-on-body that's too small or large; but a user cannot change a font's vertical proportions.

So talking about x-height with respect to extenders* really is the best compromise I think.

About what?
As I said, Times is, among its many applications, a book face, and it has the same vertical proportions (cap to x-height) as Minion.

It may make more sense, in some respects, to consider x-height in relation to ascender height, but that doesn't alter the fact that in typography, x-height is pegged to cap height.

And in practice, cap height is, I believe, more consistently pegged to em square.
I haven't done the calculation, but I would imagine that if one measured the em-unit height of caps and ascenders in a dozen faces, the cap heights would be more consistent than the ascender heights.

Therefore describing x-height in terms of cap height would give a better idea of absolute x-height at a given point size.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I know that my local newspaper only switched from Corona to Times Roman back when they adopted improved printing processes in order to include color photographs on their pages. (They've since switched to something else.)

And, yes, the Times of London was a very prestigious newspaper, not printed on the same kind of newsprint as most other newspapers. The copies I've seen were printed on white paper, but this could have been a special print run on paper that weighed less for shipment overseas.

Elsewhere in this thread, I am boggled by one poster admitting that the ratio of x-height to ascender height is more important than the ratio of x-height to cap height, even if the latter is the conventional definition of x-height... but also continuing to maintain that this in no wise contradicts his statement that, since the <strong>latter</strong> form of x-height is nearly equal between Minion and Times Roman, therefore it is invalid to categorize the former as more of a book face than the latter.

I wasn't aware that the definition of a "book face" had to depend on the conventional definition of x-height even if an alternative view of that parameter was more typographically valid: it is unclear to me what reasoning this is based on.

I wouldn't be averse to agreeing with statements that Times Roman is not all that bad as a book face, or that the difference between the x-height to ascender ratio between Times Roman and Minion is not all that large, but this specific argument seems to have a clear flaw in logic.</div>

Nick, in digital fonts x-height is of course specified relative to the Em, and the Em is scalable. 

So instead of a 'better idea' why not just use the x-height relative to the Em, as I suggested above, which gives a completely *exact* idea of the x-height at a given point size?

The x-height of Times Roman is 450 when the Em is 1000. And the x-height of Minion Regular is 438 on the same scale. That is a complete specification of the x-height. 

If you want to discuss how it will set, and the readability in a given usage, then you need to look at other factors: length of ascenders, descenders, cap height, set width, color, and diacritics, depending on the use you are considering.

This is also my answer to you, Hrant. You are right that how small or large on the body matters, but so do all the other factors I mentioned. So we'd do better to express x-height as it is actually specified in a digital font: in proportion to the em. Everything else can be a bit misleading.  

Note: After your input, I revised the TypoWiki to include the fact that in digital fonts the x-height is specified in Em units.  </div>

No, because it fails to include the one important reference point: the ascender height. The relevance of x-height size does not need to, and should not have to go through the trouble of combining two separate measures (the other being ascender-to-EM) to grasp what's really relevant.

Yes, because including that one factor leaves out others and is misleading. 

Ascender height is *not* the only important factor relevant to how the type sets. So are cap height, descender length, and many other factors--in fact many more than I mentioned above. 

So even though I agree that ascender height is the single most significant factor, the most accurate and least confusing is just to give x-height in Em units or as a percentage of the Em. </div>

True, but to me it's still a much better compromise. And if you want a bigger picture nobody's stopping you from looking at other measures. It's just that essentially forcing people to do that sort of extra mental work just to get beyond a 95% idea of how big the x-height really is is wasteful.

It's like looking at a pangram to get an idea of a font. Sure, it's not
enough to make a final decision, but it narrows things down very nicely.

It won't be typographically valid if typographers don't understand you.
In a meaningful discussion, the participants should all understand the terms involved to mean the same thing.
So it's logical to observe the conventional meanings of words, even if you think they don't make sense.

You proposed that a smaller x-height version of Times would be worthwhile, because "book faces" have small x-heights.
I alerted you to the fact that they do not, according to the conventional understanding of what x-height is.
I didn't make this up, or write the TypoWiki. I have been in the type business many years, in various capacities, and my understanding is that x-height is defined in terms of cap height. Of course, that may not be entirely logical, and one may work with a different understanding, but that doesn't alter reality.

There are cross purposes here.
As Hrant says, when comparing typeface design, it is useful to consider ascender length in assessing x-height.
As I say, when considering the absolute size of x-height a typographer will get from a particular font at a particular point size, it is useful to consider cap height.
As William says, if you really want to determine exact x-height, the number of em units will tell you.</div>

I'm saying that Times is a book face through widespread usage as such, irrespective of its x-height, however that is defined or understood. 

There is a typographic myth that Book Faces Have A Small x-Height, which is ironic, as there is also the convention that x-height is small or big in relation to cap height, which doesn't support the myth.

I wonder why.

Nick, Times and Minion do not have similar vertical proportions; and as a result they do not have similar affinities in terms of how they're used. Period. A conveniently faulty wiki does that change that. And conveniently deluded typographers (assuming what you say is even true) don't make it OK to use such confused and misleading language here.

Who cares about the absolute units? The irrelevance of point size (which is flexible) compared to the huge relevance of a font's vertical proportions (which is inflexible) breaks the usefulness of basing necessarily relative measurements on the EM.

> I’m saying that Times is a book face through widespread usage

Same old Hrant, misrepresenting to score points.

What I said was "significant", not useful.
If we're talking theory, ascender height is significant. In practice, less so.

Try this test: set two paragraphs with the same spec, one in Minion, one in Times.
You will be hard put to determine which has the larger x-height.
Now suppose you say, "well, Minion has 8% taller ascenders, therefore I will reduce the Minion setting by half a point size for a more accurate comparison, and now Minion has a smaller x-height." Well duh, you made it smaller, so of course it now has a smaller x-height!
With regard to ascender height in this comparative setting, the typographer would be more inclined to say that the ascenders of either face are too long or too short with regards to the leading, or the mise-en-page. 

Ultimately, ascenders are long or short in comparison to x-height, not the other way round.
Because x-height is the most apparent vertical dimension of a typeface.

Finally? That's what I've been saying all along.
Yes, I believe in "Readability Relativism". New shoes take time to wear in, no matter how ugly the old ones.

Book designers specify Times for text because they like the way it looks and reads.
Publishers and distributors report no adverse sales effects.
Readers don't have a problem with the face.
In fact, they wouldn't buy a mass market paperback if it was set in a "book face", because it would look too much like hard work to read. Book faces connote literary content, and they want easy language. This is a cultural dimension of readability that doesn't appear in any of the lab research, which is generally done with college students (correct me if I'm wrong).</div>

I know what you're trying to say, and generally speaking it is true for the most part - after all, there were people who thought Fraktur was readable - I do have a quibble here.

Mass market paperbacks set in Caledonia instead of Times Roman don't seem to have any problem selling. I will admit that Jenson Oldstyle might scare people away, and Caslon is much too unfashionable.

Corgi, a British paperback publisher, has used Plantin and other book faces (IIRC, even Bembo) in books which were aimed at the great unwashed (having been written by an Englishman who claimed his body was taken over by a Tibetan after he fell out of a tree) without apparent harm as well.</div>

What a load of bunk.

Your test is the sort of naive thing only the shallowest of typographers would perform. First of all, a font's x-height is certainly not the only player in apparent size. But also, if two fonts have the same absolute x-height but one's ascenders are taller, you need more leading; and that puts pressure on the vertical proportions, hence the point size. All these dimensions are linked, and cap height is one of the very smallest factors. You're allowing a font's size-on-body to completely throw off any valid evaluation. So your comparison is nearly totally useless, and no decent typographer would be "hard put" to realize that Times and Minion are not similar in vertical proportions, which is what you said, and I objected to.

* BTW, now you've quietly dropped the cap height reference?

> ascenders are long or short in comparison to x-height

Sure - same difference! The point is, caps are far less relevant. You admitted this once before, but then found a convenient weasel hole in the wiki.

Repeat: saying Times and Minion have very similar <em>vertical proportions</em> is completely false. If you're strong enough to admit that, you would save yourself a lot of contrived logic, not to mention a lot of typing!

Complete hogwash. Most book designers who specify Times

You know no such thing - there are no reference points!
This is pure, baseless fabrication.

The fact that readability research has been so flawed does not give you license to believe things that tickle your artistic fancy. The truth is, you would rather nobody ever did any readability research.

I don't know if I can really dispute that statement. After all, a lot of books do simply use Times Roman by default, without much thought being put into their design.

But I will at least point out that Times Roman has been used in some very well-designed books. The Codebrakers by David Kahn, from Macmillan impressed me very favorably with how Times Roman looks when used well. (They did get the chapter heading for the chapter titled "Russkaya Kriptologia" badly mangled, even though the italic page headings were right... nobody's perfect.)

It's true that he is being... anecdotal. However, I think that it can be safely said that except for the few who take an interest in such things, most people don't pay much attention to fonts.

If a book is set in Univers or Optima, people will notice that it's trying to be "contemporary", so that usually happens in books on art and design.

If a book is set in one of the condensed Scotch Romans from the 19th Century - or even in the vastly superior Binney & Ronaldson Oldstyle, they'll notice it's old fashioned.

"Typeset" the book on an IBM Executive typewriter, and they'll notice there's something fishy right away.

Otherwise - Bembo, Palatino, Times Roman, Caledonia, Baskerville, Century Expanded... if the responsible parties have made a reasonable effort to choose a halfway-decent serif font, and an appropriate point size given the font's x-height, a column width not stupendously long, and a little leading if necessary... and they will just go off merrily reading without noticing the effort that has been made on their behalf.

Whatever may be wrong with Times Roman, I strongly doubt that it is so seriously wrong as to percolate into the consciousness of the general public. It would indeed be kind of nice if Times with long descenders were seen more often - given that 12 point Times on a computer is 10 1/2 point Times with 1 1/2 points leading or thereabouts <em>anyways</em>, it's not as if we would have broken kerns falling out of our laser printers - but I think someone could set a mass-market paperback in Corona with hardly anyone noticing anything was amiss.</div>

Yes, it is true that people don't have to be directly interested in or aware of fonts to be affected positively when a printed page is a thing of beauty.

But when a response is subconscious and not explicit, that also means we're dealing with something that isn't out in the open, and that means - as one would expect when the subject is aesthetics, in any case - that we're dealing with something likely to be subjective rather than objective.

I think that Times Roman can be, and has been, a contributing part of many beautiful pages of text. It does have design limitations - so it is unsuited to the kind of typography where one would want Centaur instead - and it has been misused, as can happen to any font. Times, optically condensed by 10%, is something that deserves the kind of obloquy you appear to be hurling at the font in general. But all of this is just my personal taste, and you therefore do not have to account for why your taste may differ from mine - nor I for why mine differs from yours.</div>

A part of that is that there obviously is more than one factor/element to this complex equation, and we obviously can't change that. But maybe better words can help untangle this.

For example, how about distinguishing "vertical <em>proportions</em>" (inherently relative: how does say x-ht relate to asc height) from "vertical <em>metrics</em>" (which could be taken to mean x [or other elements] to the em)? Is this commonly done?
Maybe we could even find something like <em>"absolute"</em> vs. <em>"relative</em> x-height" to talk about, the former being compared to the em, the latter to the extenders (sorry Nick, I'm still not seeing how cap height could possibly be relevant here).

Nina, Cap height is relevant because it affects how closely you can lead lines that have a lot of caps, such as in classified ads, notices of performances, etc, and anything with a lot of proper names. Also large caps may be more of an issue in setting German vs English. The height of numbers can also be relevant. You can get away with tighter leading with only ascenders because they are fewer. But if you also have a lot of caps, and they are unusually tall, such as Adobe Caslon, then it's more of a constraint. 

All this is why I still think that the best thing is just to give the x-height as a percentage of the em. Then you can separately talk about other ratios: x-height to ascenders, caps, etc, as needed depending on the point you want to make. 

Terminology is not right or wrong, it's convenient or inconvenient, clear or confusing. Defining x-height as relative to the em is certainly more clear, and that's a big advantage. 

Speaking of 'absolute' x-height is confusing because in digital type there is no such thing. Speaking of 'relative x-height' raises the question: relative to what? You may want to discuss any number of relations--x-height to overshoot, to ascenders, to caps, etc., so to be clear you need to specify further. 

Trying to restrict the meaning of 'relative x-height' to caps or ascenders or bounding box just adds needless confusion, it seems to me. 

Also why not just "call it what it is". In digital type, the x-height is specified in em units, end of story. If you want to talk about other ratios, then say what ratio--it only takes two words to be clear--and go merrily along. </div>

For the purpose of talking about how large the x-height will appear on the page at a given point size, yes. But for the purpose of discussing optimal x-height as a <em>design feature of a font</em>,* and its effects, what's relevant is how the x-ht compares to other factors.
* It changes the "nature" of a type design much less if every glyph is scaled to be proportionally bigger on the em (thereby changing "your" definition of x-ht) than if the extenders are lengthened or shortened (thereby changing the relative definition of x-ht to ascender).

And of course, in this thread, the point of why x-height came up in the first place was the latter: Relative x-height as an aspect of the design.

(And of course I realize cap height is more relevant for say German than English, but I still think its relevance to reading (and typesetting) pales in comparison to the ascenders in terms of sheer frequency.)</div>

To answer this question, the x-heights of thirteen Regular fonts were measured:
Aldus, Bembo, Dolly, Electra, ITC Garamond, Gentium, Minion, Nimrod, Perpetua, Scala, Scotch Modern, Times, and Utopia. These were chosen to represent a variety of text styles, with variety of x-height-on-em, and variety of ascender overshoot above cap height.

Then the values of their x-heights were calculated three ways:
(1) % of em,  (2) % of cap height, (3) % of ascender height.

For instance, Minion:
(1) 43.4, (2) 66.8, (3) 61.1
and Times:
(1) 44.7, (2) 67.6, (3) 64.4

The standard deviation amongst these three groups, for 13 fonts, was:
(1) 4.4, (2) 4.5, (3) 4.3

From this I conclude that the three methods have similar consistency.
In other words, a typeface with a small x-height according to one method will have a comparably small x-height in another method. For purposes of comparison it doesn't matter that the "% of cap height" method ignores the effect of ascender overshoot on x-height proportion.

But what of x-height appearances at specific point sizes? 

Next the em-square percentage was used as a benchmark, assuming that this represents the "actual" height a font's x-height will appear at a given point size, and the difference was calculated between this value and each font's x-height as first (a) % of cap height, and then (b) % of ascender height.

So, the difference between "actual" x-height and (a), then (b), 
for Minion: 23.4 and 16.7
for Times: 22.9 and 19.7
etc.

Next all values of (a) and (b) were totaled, and the standard deviation calculated:
For (a) 3.3, (b) 2.9

Very close, within half a percentage point. Again, I conclude that the amount a font's ascenders overshoot cap height has no bearing on whether one compares x-height as a percentage of cap height or of ascender height. To repeat: if a font has a small x-height in one method, it has a comparably small x-height in another. 

The advantage of the cap height method is that X compared with x gives a stronger visual indication of cap-height line and median line than, say, l and x. The letter x was chosen because it suggests the median line.</div>

That's an entirely unsound conclusion, because it doesn't account for which direction the deviation is for a given font.

Furthermore, why are you using Standard Deviation? Typographers choose fonts, and  a given font is one unique case. It's almost like you're saying Times and ITC Garamond have similar vertical proportions!

?
This conclusion also makes no sense.

Anyway, there are more than 13 fonts out there. What you describe obviously does not work for fonts with short caps (which are not at all rare these days). No obfuscating math is needed to figure that out.

Why use an inferior method, even if you might get lucky with it?

		<div class="commentbody">I have a Math minor - specialization: Numerical Analysis. Not that most people need any such background to grasp that some rudimentary averaging* is useless when comparing individual fonts. You need only the most basic math. The difference in vertical proportions between Times and Minion is about 3%. That's 30 units in an Em of 1000. I don't know about you, but when I define my vertical proportions, I worry about units in the single digits. Furthermore, and this is just as significant, the difference in widths seems to be about double that. Ergo: the two fonts do not have similar proportions. And you need <em>no</em> math at all to see this - one simply needs to look.

		<div class="commentbody">If you're so math savvy, please deal with the subject. It's spelled out in the question at the beginning.

This is not about comparing two fonts using the same x-height definition, or by eye.
It's about calculating which system of x-height definition -- percentage of em, percentage of cap height, percentage of ascender height -- is the most consistent over a number of fonts.

Isn't that knowledge desirable in assessing systems of x-height definition?
Typographers have to deal with many potential candidates, as you stress.
If one system had significantly more or less standard deviation, then it could be inferred that there was a difference in accuracy. But the way it stands, for the most significant figures -- where the standard deviations are 3.3% and 2.9% -- there is only a .4% difference, which corresponds to 4 units of em.

What makes you think that increasing the sample, or changing its members, would impact the outcome significantly?
Bear in mind that there are already four short cap fonts in the sample: Aldus, Bembo, Dolly and Gentium.

*Re Raph, was that when he was scanning and blending letterpress outlines? Or when he was popquizzing which waveforms were more attractive? I questioned the aesthetic validity of both those. As for Fourier transforms, interesting stuff in theory, but again, better to rely on one's eyes to appreciate text colour. 

As you are no doubt aware, I think the best way to set type is to try many fonts in a layout, play with size, leading etc., and work out what looks to be the best design solution. Not much theory there. I don't believe that by pursuing numeric analysis of x-heights I'm contradicting my preference for using taste as the arbiter of design decisions. This is pure research--whether x height is better defined in terms of cap height or x-height has no bearing on whether one chooses Times or Minion, and how much leading you give them, because one will try both, with various leading, and see which is most readable.

I'm convinced by Mike Parker's theory.
And I suspect it has a lot of currency, having been promoted by Font Bureau in its Starling typeface material.
But you're right, there is no way of knowing what the general consensus is.

2) Any analysis that goes against the basic realization that 5% of text cannot have the same relevance as 95% of text is flawed analysis. Specifically here, your conclusion that x-to-cap is just as good as x-to-ascender cannot be arrived at from any Standard Deviation calculation. The results of such calculations cannot be applied to gauge specific fonts. This is critical because typographers do not make decisions based on aggregate statistics, and rightly so. Typographers need to figure out, for example, whether Times and Minion have comparable proportions. If they look at x-to-cap to do this, they will be confused; their results will be inferior; they will be poor typographers.

Why? Both x-to-ascender and x-to-cap calculations show that these two faces have comparable proportions within the group of 13. In other words, their values are close to the mean, less than the standard deviation. (Although I didn't mention the mean values in my 4:01 post, it does show that the difference between these fonts is less than the standard deviation for the whole group.) This is not to say that the difference between them isn't significant, it's just not big. So that's one conclusion that can be drawn from the data, that these are two faces with "average" x-height, however measured. 

But the purpose of the exercise wasn't head-to-head font comparisons, it was to analyze the quality of different methods of calculating x-height, as applied to a large set of fonts.

Well previously, the discussion was about which "system of x-height definition" makes the most sense. :-\
The idea that it statistically doesn't make a huge difference whether one chooses to compare x-height to cap or asc height, or to the em, doesn't nullify the relevance of the logical (and actually, practically relevant) difference in choosing one definition over the others.
And I'd agree with Hrant that a difference of 3%, in this discipline, really sounds like way too much for the results of this little investigation to be all that significant.

If you're so sure that x-height, per se, doesn't matter too much, just say so. Switching gears from jumbled logic to empirical analysis, and then again to broad statements of typographer-centric relativism, doesn't exactly enforce your point.</div>

And what's wrong with putting a fence between pure research and practice? Theory can too easily become dogma.

3% is a lot when you're designing a typeface, trying to hit the sweet spot. But not so much when you're comparing fonts.
Comparing Times and Minion, they are remarkably similar at the same spec, in terms of copy-fit and proportion. Times is a bit stronger, due to its thicker strokes and more contrasty fit, more so than its larger x-height (1.3% of em bigger). So to get a similar heft of text block, you would drop the Times point size, say from 12 to 11.8. The difference in ascender length doesn't come into play after adding a couple of points leading--it's such a negligible proportion of that amount.

I wouldn't say that x-height is unimportant, but for comparing average x-height types like these, where the difference in their x-height is so small however it's measured, it doesn't matter too much.</div>

Nick, don't you realize this doesn't befit a type designer?

For one thing, if that were true, why would anybody buy your fonts?
It's telling that most people don't buy fonts; to them 3% is nothing.
But there are enough people that care about things that seem tiny for
you to stay in business. And there's a lot more than 3% difference
between staying in business and not.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Not really - that’s a false conclusion.</em>

In this statistical comparison, it states that values within the standard deviation are comparable.
That's a true conclusion, based on the data.

Based on the same data, the four short cap fonts in the sample fall outside the standard deviation, as do the "news" fonts, Nimrod and Utopia.

<em>Times and Minion ... are remarkably similar...</em>

"...at the same spec...in terms of copy fit and proportion."

Why don't you include the whole sentence, or would that upset your argument?

My conclusion, after looking at the data, is that Minion and Times have x-heights that are close to the average, to the extent that x-height is a minor consideration when assessing their relative merits--other factors are far more important, such as the relative sharpness of Times' serifs, and the heaviness of the horizontally-stressed stroke on lower case "e " and "c". 

Also, it seems to me that you are underestimating the significance of ascender overshoot with regards to cap height.
Certainly, capitals occur far less frequently than ascenders in U&lc text, but cap-lowercase sequences such as T_h and W_h play a huge role in determining the personality of a typeface, in English.

<em>Nick, don’t you realize this doesn’t befit a type designer?</em>

I don't think so.
And that is a conclusion supported by my statistical analysis.
Using your preferred definition of x-height, classic book faces that I measured such as Aldus (56%), Bembo (59%), and Perpetua (56%) do indeed have low values, but there are other perfectly serviceable book faces with "normal" x-heights, such as Dolly (61%), Minion (61%) and Scala (61%). And this distinction is reinforced by the calculation of a Standard Deviation. How do you explain that? 
What would constitute, in your opinion, a convincing sample group of text faces, and where would you draw the line between bookish and non-bookish?

I suspect that one's selection of text faces might skew the results, depending on whether one included faces such as Utopia (66%) in the sample group.

What do you make of ITC Century Book (68%)? It is not a classic book face, but it is named and published as a book face and many books are printed in it. Are they all garbage?

<em>Are you now saying that sequences of x-height and ascending letters (like “fi”) don’t contribute much to a font’s personality?</em>

I said that the combinations T_h and W_h contribute a lot to the personality of types. That's where ascender overshoot is most noticeable, and I assume that typographers use mental images of these combinations to help conceptualize, categorize and remember typefaces.

I don't know if the line between classic book faces and other faces is really drawn between Minion and Times Roman.

And I wouldn't call Della Robbia or Typo Upright book faces either, so I'll definitely agree that proportions relative to x-height can be dwarfed in importance by other factors (which usually aren't varied for non-display faces as much, though).

If I believe the statements

"Minion is a valid example of a classic book face."

and

"Times Roman varies sufficiently in its proportions from Minion that it does not quite qualify as a classic book face."

that does not imply that I have to think that books set in Times Roman, Utopia, or even Corona are "garbage".

Corona and Antique Olive can be quite readable. If someone sets a book in Corona - and at least remembers to use leading - I might be somewhat dismayed that he seemed to have used whatever happened to be lying around inside his Linotype at the time, but slightly substandard typography isn't going to make me sneer too loudly at a book if I find its content valuable.

People should care about typography. But you can care about something and still keep it in perspective.</div>

Tellingly, Utopia is a newspaper face.
Times BTW is ~68%. And Minion is ~62%.
So my initial measurement was way off,
in your favor however.

But anyway you don't believe vertical proportions are a big deal in
evaluating whether a font is fit for a book or not... This, BTW, even
though you wrote:
"Times has almost the same vertical proportions (cap to x-height ratio)
as Minion, a face that has become quite popular and respected for book
and text work in general."

Same here. In fact Minion is a bit too large on the body for that.
So it can work for a book at slightly smaller sizes, but it would
be more versatile (for book work, but tellingly not overall*) if it
were slightly narrower and had a smaller x-height.

* Noting that Adobe has historically liked to please the most people.

Gary, I also find Times formally attractive - like a nice building, or ship.
But to me that actually confirms one of my axioms: that a true text font
must necessarily look at least a little bit ungainly when viewed large.
This is because scale has a very large say in how letterforms look and work.
So in effect Times is too much of a display face to do the heavy lifting of
extended reading. Minion is far less so.

		<div class="commentbody">My calculations were based on your graphic of November 27. Was that flawed? BTW, I think your ascender numbers are not taking overshoot into account; so the absolute ascender numbers should be lowered (thus increasing the percentage difference). And more significantly the head serifs in Times (like at the top of the "el") are steeper than the ones in Minion, so the ascender value for Minion should be lowered less than the one for Times, thus (further) increasing the percentage difference.

Anyway, 3% is still significant (I'm dismissing the x-to-cap codswallop) especially when coupled to the width difference. I think in practice you secretly agree, because I really can't imagine that when determining your fonts' proportions once you come within <strong>30 units</strong> you say: "Yeah, close enough, whatever."

The thing is, I don't grasp why you're nitpicking this point, since you've already stated that Times is really a more readable font than Minion -presumably for any kind of setting- simply because it's seen by readers much more frequently. Proportions, shroportions, right? BTW, do you tell your potential customers this sort of thing? I mean, you might be forgiven for not volunteering such insight when a juicy payment is imminent, but if somebody asks you point-blank "Is this as readable than Times?" I guess you just <em>have</em> to say: "Not even close! This font was just released last month. It would have to be the default MS Word font for two decades to become as readable as Times!"

> What’s your point?

My point is that you can't combine:
- Times is a book face because it shares vertical
proportions with Minion, an "uncontested"* book face,
AND
- vertical proportions are not central to bookishness.

You honestly don't see this?

That's sloppy, working from a screen grab.
My calculations are derived from the digital font BCP coordinates. 
Don't you have Times and Minion on your hard drive?

<em>the head serifs in Times (like at the top of the “el”) are steeper than the ones in Minion</em>

So, you admit another problem with the ascender method -- the need to make a subjective decision as to where the "optical extreme" of the terminal is.

Is this Nick Shinn talking?!

Anyway it's not that subjective. And even if we would put the optical line a slightly different place, my point was that at the very least you can admit that the more slanted the top (like in Times) the lower the optical line is. This increases the difference between Times and Minion.

> What makes you draw such bizarre conclusions?

?
You say that Times is a fine book face simply because a lot of books have been set in it. So since far more books have been set in Times than in Minion <em>and the vertical proportions either don't matter or are close enough anyway*</em> then Times must be more readable.

* It's sort of stopped mattering what you actually believe...

The only way I can think of that that's not what you actually mean is if readability is essentially <em>irrelevant</em>. This it doesn't matter how easy/hard a text is to read. That the only important thing is how it looks! (But I guess I shouldn't put that past you.)

> If a and b are both members of set c, it doesn’t follow that a = b!

This is all quite delusional...

You're putting words in my mouth. Again. Please stop.

What I actually said was, "...why you would consider the most-read book face ever to not be a “book face”.

And again,
"We’re talking about a face, designed for an upscale newspaper, that has become the most-used, most-read face in book publishing. It seems absurd to not consider it a book face, amongst its many other uses."

And again,
"I’m saying that Times is a book face through widespread usage as such..."

Did I ever qualify it as fine or good?

<em>...it’s not that subjective. </em>

...give or take 3%?

<em>Since far more books have been set in Times than in Minion and the vertical proportions either don’t matter or are close enough anyway* then Times must be more readable.</em>

Sorry, I don't subscribe to your notion that vertical proportions determine the readability of a typeface.
What proof have you of this?

<em>It’s sort of stopped mattering what you actually believe...</em>

Good!
I'm hoping to discover something from this thread, not bully across my prejudices.
At one point I stated that I suspected x-to-cap heights of a group of faces to be less consistent than x-to-ascender, then I did the math and concluded that isn't so. Don't concern yourself so much with trying to guess what I believe, or whether a recent post of mine contradicts a previous one, but try for new insights, such as your observation about the difficulty of accurately measuring x-height--even if you find you are undermining a previous idea you had held.

		<div class="commentbody">My opinion of Times Roman is that it <em>is</em> a fine and good typeface.

But it would simply be wrong to say that it is an oldstyle face; it's transitional. And Bodoni is fine and good too, if suitable for fewer purposes than Times; it is neither oldstyle nor transitional, it is modern.

I think that Times Roman has been used to excellent effect in the typesetting of books. However, in the English language at least, phrases don't always mean the sum of their parts.

So when someone says that a typeface is a "book face", or, better yet, a "classical book face", being sufficiently naive that I don't expect that if I am not familiar with a technical term used in typography, then it <em>isn't</em> a technical term in typography... I assume that the speaker (or writer) is indeed using a technical term.

If Corona is a newspaper face, and Caslon, Bembo, and Baskerville are book faces, then I would suppose that Times lies somewhere in between. It certainly wouldn't be legible under the kinds of demanding printing conditions that made the resort to the newspaper legibility faces necessary. But its design was affected by having been aimed at an application in which legibility in small sizes was important.

I think it is useful and meaningful to have such a technical term, and that its existence doesn't mean that it's bad typography to use a typeface which isn't a "book face" to typeset a book.

There's even a simple definition of a "book face" which I can offer that illustrates why x-height is an important factor without having to define a new kind of x-height, or argue why ascenders are more important than cap height. A book face might simply be a face that a book may be well typeset in... without any leading.

Then everything becomes clear and simple. Yes, Times Roman has been used for the text of many beautiful books - but not unleaded. It can be used, and used well, in a book - but because that is not its native element, it needs a little help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What is the amount of leading appropriate for book typography?
Stanley Morison's didactic work on typography (First Principles, 1937?) is set in Bembo, with solid leading--with the result that ascenders and descenders frequently entangle visually, almost touching. Solid setting is not much used today. I believe that most book designers now give Bembo "a little help" in the leading department. The idea that text type needs extra leading is entrenched in the Paragraph defaults of Word, Quark, and InDesign, and in every font that doesn't have its TypoLineGap value set to zero.

In Scotch Modern, my revival of a mid 19th century Modern, I set TypoLineGap to zero, so that (many) web pages set solid in browser display. I think it looks cool and have no trouble reading it, but most people would think the readability is poor. Nonetheless, I think it's appropriate for such facsimile revivals.

(Discussion of leading probably warrants another thread.)

<em>If ... Caslon, Bembo, and Baskerville are book faces,</em> 

But were they designed as such? That could be argued, as there was very little commercial or jobbing typography at the time. Nonetheless, Caslon in particular has proved extremely adaptable--for instance as a display face in 20th century print advertising, e.g. for Honda in the 1980s.

<em>I think it is useful and meaningful to have such a technical term, and that its existence doesn’t mean that it’s bad typography to use a typeface which isn’t a “book face” to typeset a book.</em>

I'm not so sure. A lot of books have been set in digital Bembo and Perpetua in recent years, because that was a safe bet, as they are classic faces used in letterpress book printing. However, the digital versions lack the heft of the older technology, with the result that there is a lot of anemic-looking book type out there. Not just an aesthetic problem, but a practical problem for boomers and other demographics with less than perfect vision. I would prefer a splodgy, overinked paperback in Times over a finely-printed work in Perpetua or Bembo, because unless I put on my best reading glasses, turn up the light bright, and hold the book at just the right distance, it's harder to read those classic faces in their toney settings. 

<em>...what “book face” might really mean...</em>

Don't fall for that. What Hrant really means is that he would like to impose his narrow conservative taste on such matters as dogma, supported with "logical" arguments. Now <em>that's</em> agenda, as practiced politically by the American right.</div>

I was just planning, shortly before seeing your post, to start a thread on leading - with a twist.

As for "narrow conservative taste", I would expect technical terms to have been in use for a long time, and thus to reflect well-established practice. So the fact that we call a font with attributes X a "book face" doesn't have to mean that we have to be so narrow and conservative as to believe it is only appropriate to set books in traditional book faces.

Naturally, letting one side control the meanings of words can be dangerous, but I don't think that Hrant is out to get us to view Times Roman as doubleplusungood.</div>
