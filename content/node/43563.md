body: 'I''m trying to find a font I saw in a magazine a few months ago. It was a "Pubic
  Hair Font" "Pubes Font" or "Pubic Font" something along those lines and it was placed
  in a V on the outline of a womens body. I read communications art, print, and cmyk
  mostly so I''m pretty sure I stumbled upon it in one of those. If anyone could help
  me out I''d greatly appreciate it :) '

  body: I've seen two band posters that utilize "that" shape in "that" place. One
    being The New Pornographers, the other was Peaches. I can't seem to find the images,
    I think they were screen prints. Not sure if that's what you were looking for,
    or if it even helps.
