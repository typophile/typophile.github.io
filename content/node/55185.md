body: "Here are some awesome pictures of costumes. The only costume that has type
  on it is the third one. I do not know if it is a certain typeface or not but is
  is elaborate and I believe completely made out of sequins. It is a Zulu king costume,
  and most of them that I saw in the museum had a Z on it somewhere. The other costumes
  do not have type on them but I thought that it would be nice to show a little bit
  of Mardi Gras history in New Orleans. So enjoy!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN1884_5048.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN1888_6106.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN1890_4035.jpg]"
