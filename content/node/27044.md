body: Last Thursday the forums were down for about 4 hours. I  <BR>learned today that
  it coincided with the posting of an article on  <BR><a href="http://www.slate.com"
  target="_blank">Slate</a> that details Typophile&#39;s <a href="http://www.typophile.com/smallerpicture/"
  target="_blank">The Smaller Picture</a> collaborative <BR>project and included a
  link. 480,000 hits to the &#34;smaller.cgi&#34;  <BR>code later and the overloaded
  script tanked, taking the forums  <BR>down with it. <BR> <BR>You may recall that
  at the height of the popularity of The Smaller  <BR>Picture our host took us offline
  due to the load it put on their  <BR>server. <BR> <BR>Read Slate&#39;s article,
