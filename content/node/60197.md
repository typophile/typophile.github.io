  body: "It's a hideously de-seriffed serif made into a sans. That's the sort of thing
    that designers with not much experience think is a good idea until they get more
    experience. For some reason this kind of thing makes me really angry. I'm going
    to have some lunch and calm down now.\r\n\r\nI could put an unprintable name to
    it.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
