  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,
Starting a new thread with this to get rid of all the crap in the other one.

here's the description again:
MAQ is a company that is going to start giving out certificates for nurses and other people in the medical field. The certificate is for treatment/handling of prescription drugs, dosage and things like that for patients.


yes yes, trying a more modern approach this time. A bowl, which references to the Bowl of Hygeia, used by other medicine organizations.

Leafs witch symbolizes growth.

The top one is the newest version.


Feedback greatly appreciated.
peter

		<div class="commentbody">Oh yeah, looking good, looking 'important'. For me it's definitely number one, the other ones look blobby because they don't have enough air through the devices and also the shapes, although meaningful, seem not to balance compositionally. Although I do like the stripes.

I wonder though whether number one could go even simpler? The triangle of the bowl perhaps dominates too much (also makes t a bit top heavy) and takes away from the nice balance the leaves and the text have between light and dark. Perhaps it's worth exploring just the leaves or the bowl or something. Loving the colours,  *makes mental note to use oranges and purples together in the future*
Again, though, looking good.</div>

The leafs look like flames in the top two ones. Number three looks like a leaf.

02
Remember to test the design in b/w also

03
I like the first design (the top one) best

04
Bowl ... what bowl? Is the blue triangle a bowl? Then what is the brown shape on top of it? The inside of the bowl seen in perspective? Or some kind of stylized content?
And what is the brown upside-down triangular shape between the leafs?
... I would say that the bowl is more abstract than the leafs/flames if you get my drift ... I think they should have the same amount likeness/should be drawn in the same style

05
Overall: nice, clean, professional, trustworthy, nice colours

06
This version is two-storey ... you may consider a one-storey version ... (symbol left and typography right) ... I mean, you may need both ...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the stripes too, I've been trying to incorporeate them in to the first one but no good results yet.

I've been testing this idea to have the leafs connected at the botton and have the bowl "grow" out of them, would be a nice suitable concept but I think I need to draw a diffretn bowl for that to work, keeping it one color and then I would get rid of the traingle top bit beeing to heavey. Have to work more on that version though.

Yeah I've noticed that the leaves aren't precived as leaves. Some other people have pointed that out also.

Yes the orange top is supposed to symbolize conten, so you would have a full bowl. The hole two triangel thing is supposed to show diversity by having the bowl split in two colors, same as two color leaves.

I'm also have a version that is one storey because they are considering using an additional text with the name, something like "Competent Drugcare" or something like tahat but I can't post that version here since the real name is still secret.

The MAQ version of the logo will not be used with this text so that's why it's two storey. The MAQ version will probably be in use for a few months until they decide what the project is to become, a company or some kind of non-profit association. The final name depends on this aswell.


thanks will post updates in a couple of days.

		<div class="commentbody">I like number 2 best as the leaves look most like leaves, as they do not rise as sharply.
The 'Q' I am not too fond of. I would use a Q with a bar that runs in a squiggle horizontally through the bowl of the 'Q'

Nice work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd correct the "spikes" within the blue part and make them less pointed by putting the node apart into two nodes. It will also help with printing process. Or cut vinyl.

The outer curve seems symmetric but the top of the symbol doesn't suggest that.

Maybe make the gap between both parts smaller?

Just suggestions to try out. Otherwise I like it a lot.</div>
