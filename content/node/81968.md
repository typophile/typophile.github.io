  that we cannot design a typeface on our own by the deadline (which is near as hell,
  by the way).\r\n\r\nWhat are the legal aspects of using a shareware font?\r\n\r\nUp
  to now I've choosen Dante and I'm trying to find a respectable sans-serif companion
  for it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know what should we do, if the identity system is accepted,
  to legally use Dante and the sans-serif companion (think of renowned names like
  Univers, Frutiger etc.).\r\n\r\nWe'll have to buy the license and goodbye? Or there's
  something more complex behind?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for all the replies!\r\na."

  body: "The Build section isn\u2019t the most appropriate place where to ask such
    a question. You should move the thread.\r\nAs for the question itself: it depends
    by the use of the typeface. \r\nIf the identity involves just the logo and tagline,
    the designer must own a license for the font(s) appropriate for the use (some
    foundries ask more if the font is used in logos, for example).\r\nIf the font
    will be used to set all the text for any given product by the client, the client
    itself will need to purchase an appropriate license (presumably a site license)
    for the use of the font."
