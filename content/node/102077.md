  2 Of Letter' of Moxon's ...Art of printing:\r\nWhen he speaks of 'feet' in 1683,
  should this be regarded as The Roman foot divided by the 10/11 rule of the 'Composition

  body: It's probably a mistake to try to be too systematic about units of measure
    prior to 1795. For Moxon, as the Wikipedia article indicates, these would be English
    feet, i.e., more or less the same as 12 inches American, but measures were less
    standardized in general before the Industrial Revolution, so it should be thought
    of as roughly 30 or 31 centimeters, give or take, not as an exact unit. Each typefounder
    or printer would have had his own measuring tools that might or might not give
    the same results as others'.
