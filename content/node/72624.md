  in collaboration with design studio FM milano, for a pitch for the new identity
  program of the Center of Contemporary Art in Lugano, Italy. It is a vast project
  embracing many different sectors of the center, from music to theater to art. Therefore
  FM milano's idea was to connect all these entities with a unique typeface that would
  give the center recognisibility and character. The first weight to be developed
  was a display version to be used on posters, in the logotype and other promotional
  material. The typeface would then, if accepted, be expanded into a broader range
  of weights.\r\nThe concept of the whole identity derives from the special place
  Lugano, a lake surrounded by mountains and particularly the Monte Br\xE8 that is
  visible from the new building of the art center. The visuals are a representation
  of reflections, natural colours and triangular shapes of mountains.\r\nThe brief
  for the typeface was based on these visual ideas. It described to combine swiss
  typographic tradition with the specifically natural environment of Lugano and its
  organic shapes. The result is a rather dark display typeface, qute stiff in structure
  but with playful details, such as the curved outstrokes and soft stem terminals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_1_4850.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_2_5347.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_3_6430.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_4_4024.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_5_3660.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_6_4342.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAC_8_3924.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nsee

  body: "Nice work!\r\n\r\nDetails I see:\r\n. \"j\" seems to have more space at the
    right side. (look the space with the \"k\")\r\n. \"z\" the upper stroke at the
    left seems to exeed too much, this might generate some tracking problems.\r\n.
    \"A\" the middle stroke might be a bit low\r\n. \"4\" diagonal stroke might be
    thin.\r\n. \"B,E,F,L\" seem to be narrow compared to the other letters.\r\n. \"R\"
    the leg should be a little more to the right, if you prolong the stroke it should
    reatch the upper left vertex.\r\n\r\nI'm doing something similar now, so its nice
    to have theese examples.\r\nWill it be available to purchase or it's a exclusive
    job?\r\nCongrats!!! :)"
