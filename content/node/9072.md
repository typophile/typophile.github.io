  body: 'Not so much a crit, but a general comment: I like it. It&#39;s very stripped
    down but has just enough character that it isn&#39;t dull or blunt. From an on-screen
    glance, it looks very even.'

  body: The M and the W are interesting but the middle join feels too wide. <BR> <BR>The
    bowl of the g feels disproportionately large next to the tail. <BR> <BR>I like
    the curved leg of the k. I also like the chiseled tops on A, N, and Z. <BR> <BR>Right
    now the ratio of letter spacing to word spacing makes the text a little hard to
    follow. This may be a function of the face being light; I don&#39;t know. <BR>
    <BR>Overall, I like its simplicity, but it needs tweaking to harmonize the whole
    alphabet &#40;the Q, which I otherwise like, sticks out of the face, as does the
    k&#41;. With a little work, it would be characterless enough to make a good sans
    body text.

  body: Hmm, it&#39;s nice. <BR> <BR>The body-weight is full and nicely packed out.
    <BR> <BR>Not sure about the lowercase &#39;i&#39; though. I&#39;m not a great
    fan of such style.

  body: 'I think that mono weight &#39;stroke types&#39; are fun. The real trick is
    when you start to optically adjust the strokes. Forrest mentioned the thick joins
    on the M and the W, which are good examples of letters where you need some optical
    trickery to make it feel even. You will need to adjust most of the other joins
    as well before you&#39;ll be done. One good exercise is to make some bold characters,
    and start to play with how the letters wear the extra weight. As the strokes get
    wider, some of the optical problems will become more apparent. <BR> <BR>Of course,
    the spacing needs work. It looks like you&#39;ve got too much tracking in there
    to compensate for the uneven spacing. The best way to figure it out is to look
    at the spacing in other similar types, and plain old trial and error, but here
    are some things I&#39;ve figured out: The more open the side of a letter, the
    less space it gets. For example, the right side-bearing of the &#39;r&#39; gets
    very little &#40;almost none&#41;. The left side-bearing of the h, should have
    more. The right side-bearing of the c, in this type is very open, so it should
    have more space. Curved sides &#40;like o&#39;s&#41; should have a smaller space
    than straight sides &#40;like h&#39;s&#41;. Etc, etc.'
