body: "Howdy! In going through the archives of the <a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/>Yale
  Daily News</a>, I came across this sans used for headlines in the mid- and late-1950s.
  It seems to me to be a mid-century humanizing step in the evolution of grotesques,
  following the example of [[Morris Fuller Benton]]'s News, Trade, Franklin, and Clearface
  gothics, but I could definitely be misguided. As always, any help or directions
  for further research would be very much appreciated. (And sorry for the so-so images;
  they're the best my camera phone can do :-) )\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Merrymakingydn_3949.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forydn_5549.jpg]"

    is a possibility, but it appears there are some differences with that one, too

  body: "Thanks, Brian. Tempo and Erbar do have that stunted \"f\", but I think my
    sans is a bit less geometric (open \"e\", \"a\", and \"g\", angled terminals on
    the \"r\"). I looked through my FontBook, but the related types (Futura, Neuzeit
    Grotesk, Super Grotesk, DIN, etc.) are just more geometric. Hmmm...\r\n\r\nIn
    case it helps, some of the other headline types we used around that time were
    (I believe) Cheltenham, Didot, Trade Gothic Compressed, and Futura."

  body: It's Granby Bold Condensed. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=granby&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Merrymaking%20for&sample_size=36">FontShop</a>
    has some digital versions of Granby, but not Bold Condensed. Note that the dot
    on the "i" is usually a diamond, but in some weights it's a rectangle, including
    Bold Condensed.

  body: Fantastic! Thanks a ton, Mark. No more mystery, and now I've got another typeface
    to add to my type ID repertoire. I do find it interesting that in the light weights
    the bottom stroke of the "e" is vertically cut off like in Gill Sans, but in the
    heavier weights it's diagonal (like in my images); reminds me a bit of the Helvetica
    "a" tail.
