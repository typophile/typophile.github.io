    yes, a.k.a. Ondine, designed by Adrian Frutiger\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ondine/\r\n\r\nHard
    to say on the \"T\" a quick search didn't turn anything up but that doesn't mean
    it's not digitized. There are also tons of Dover books with initials like these,
    many now available on CD as well. I don't have the time to find that!"
