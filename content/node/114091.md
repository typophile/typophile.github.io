body: I was given these type of fonts for a design I work on. I need them in true
  or open type. Is there a way to convert .FOG format fonts without buying Foglamp
  program?

  body: .FOG was the extension used for Fontographer 3.5, not FogLamp. Anyway, FogLamp
    has been discontinued and is no longer available for purchase. Fontographer is
    still available.

  body: Besides Fontographer, the latest (at least) FontLab Studio will open Fontographer's
    .fog files. Then you can write off .otf or .ttf -- whichever.
