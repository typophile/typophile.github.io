    I''d like some kind of explanation of your process for the letter "C". CS3? 4?
    5? Was this a path trace filter? What did we miss? Thanks!'

    and rotated the form, pasting behind each time. 1 degree at a time!'

  body: Nice work! What was your thinking behind the "O" design? (or why did you select
    this approach above any others?)

  body: Thanks! The O was inspired by a pattern I saw on a manhole cover, where the
    rain had puddled inside raised shapes. It hinted at black letter forms in my eyes,
    but retained strict geometry created by a grid of smaller shapes. The O could
    easily be 1 color, filled, but I liked seeing the different pieces make up the
    final form in an optical illusion of sorts.
