  wanted to know whether you can recommend places of typographic interest that shouldn't
  be missed. At the moment I'm only sure about St Brides but lighter suggestions are
  very much welcome too.\r\nThank you,\r\nAkos"

      check out as many of these spots as I can.

  body: I recommend a trip to the British Library. You can't access the reading rooms
    without a pass, but the exhibition halls are well worth a visit (more focused
    on manuscripts than typography, but with some truly stunning and culturally important
    stuff on show), and the shop usually has a good collection of type-related stuff.
