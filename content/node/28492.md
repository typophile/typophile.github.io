  body: The first one (or third for that matter) could work if you extend the r a
    little to obtain the same x-height as the g & b so that it ends halfway down the
    g-bowl. I actually did read g & b, but missed the r. I like these logo's a lot,
    even if they're not entirely legible. The third one is best in my opinion.

      posted, the one you find unbalanced. Perhaps moving the 'r' further up (adjusting
      so that it still reflects the curve of the 'g') would balance the logo out a
      bit and frame the middle letter as the focal point. I don't like the \"RGB'07\"

    last suggestion. Use your current forms as a foundation, then loosen them up a
    little more. Make the shapes less rigid without losing the general shape. Maybe
    consider adding some additional graphic elements to further contribute to the
