<p>I&rsquo;d recommend that you keep it to a page.</p>
<p>Where are you sending it too? A person? An HR department?</p>
<p>The typical advice is to keep it simple, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;over design&rsquo; it, make it readable, and make it one page.</p>
<p>That said, in certain cases (namely large corporate HR departments), you may need to toss in a bunch of keywords to get by the resume filtering software.</p>

<p>Definitely keep it to a page. Feels padded otherwise. I sometimes attach a list of books I&rsquo;ve designed (I&rsquo;m a book designer) to the resume but the main resume itself fits on a page - even w/20 yrs experience.</p>

<p>I never reacted well to &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; or &ldquo;Summary of qualifications&rdquo; or overly descriptive text in a resume. Nothing that smacks too much of self-promotion or filler. I want a concise job history with relevant (but not the word) responsibilities listed - ideally in bullet points. Education history, skills (software, foreign languages), awards are important too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m with Patty on much of what she&rsquo;s suggested. &ldquo;Relevant&rdquo; is a dead giveaway that you&rsquo;re feeling awkward about your experience, and even if you <em>are</em> feeling awkward, that&rsquo;s the last thing you want to convey. Same goes for &ldquo;personal&rdquo; skills or anything along those lines. When I discuss résumé writing &amp; formatting in class my foundation rule is to avoid, at all costs, claims of any kind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good with Photoshop.&rdquo; &ldquo;6 years experience with InDesign.&rdquo; &ldquo;If given the oportunity I will&hellip;&rdquo; Crap, crap, crap. Like Patty pointed towards, <em>prove it</em> by listing <em>what you&rsquo;ve actually done</em>. That said, don&rsquo;t let your résumé turn into a data file, it needs just a touch of personality (both in the design and the copy writing), but good writing and design are subtle (this isn&rsquo;t adverting, even if it is).</p>
<p>As for one page, I don&rsquo;t know about that. Mine&rsquo;s 9 pages long, and depending on the position/contract I&rsquo;m going for I tend to edit it down to just the &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; stuff, which is still usually 5+ pages. While that first page has to do a lot of the work (almost all of it), one page always feels light to me. That said, if you&rsquo;ve got a client list like Patty&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t need much else.</p>
<p>[Patty, you&rsquo;re stuff is too good to be represented by squooshed and pixelated graphics on your site. Kick your developer (or yourself) in the behind and reformat those graphics so that they display at their real size.]</p>

<p>Jason, I agree with most of what you say; likewise with you, Patty. The resume is supposed to sell what you do best, etc. That said, my resume is 2 pages long (gasp!), and on the second page I do list which software programs I know and how long I&rsquo;ve been using them. First and foremost is what I&rsquo;ve done, though &ndash; work experience and studies. I don&rsquo;t list references or bother to have a line that says they are available upon request. People know that stuff.</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;glimpse and a hook&rdquo; article, that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard someone say they don&rsquo;t want a cover letter! Cover letters are supposed to show taht you, um, like, know how to communicate and stuff.  ;-D</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One more note on Patty&rsquo;s site (in case it might be useful to others). The bug is that the images in your site are squished to fit in your HTML code; that is, the code is specifying dimensions that are not correct. Thus, when the image displays in a browser it&rsquo;s getting squooshed (that&rsquo;s the technical term) and thus ends up looking pixelated.</p>
<p>For instance, here&rsquo;s one of your graphics cropped in half but at its real size (approx. 400x400 pixels):
<img src="/images/old-images/Bali_real_5751.jpg" alt="">
 </p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what what it looks like on your site in my browser (your HTML code specifies the squooshed dimensions of 300x300 pixels):
<img src="/images/old-images/Bali_squooshed_3572.jpg" alt="">
 </p>
<p>It simply looks like your developer cut the corner of actually reformatting the images to the required size and instead just packed and crammed them into position in the HTML.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why the pages are so slow to download is that the image files are considerably larger (dimensions) than they need to be. If they were reformated to the correct dimensions, their files size would shrink quite a bit.</p>
<p>And while Stephen is right about the JPG artifacts, if you balance the optimization settings they&rsquo;re easily avoidable.</p>
<p>ps. Thanks a lot for bringing this up Eddie, now I&rsquo;ve gone in to pare down my CV and I&rsquo;d forgotten how painful it is to put these things together.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, HTML doesn&rsquo;t call for any DPI setting. It&rsquo;s merely saying the image is 300 pixels x 300 pixels, so you want to make your actual image 300 x 300 pixels. DPI is irrelevant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point, sort of. DPI is, of course, relevant, because if the images were output as 300dpi JPGs then they&rsquo;re going to be squooshed in the HTML even more. I suppose I was assuming it obvious that graphics for web should be 72dpi, but the pixel dimenions of the graphics (in Patty&rsquo;s case) should match her HTML specs (eg. width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; height=&ldquo;300&rdquo;).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>yes that&rsquo;s very important - patty, my web builders implored me to supply my images to them at the pixel size i wanted them seen - at 72dpi. (exactly as jason explained above).</p>
<p>this also allows you to optimize the images for the reduced size. in my more complex illustrations, for example, i reduce them to the required size, duplicate the layer, slightly blur the top layer, then reduce it to 50% transparency. flatten again. this allows the original &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; layer to dominate, but it slightly forgives and softens the pixelation produced by radical reduction.</p>
<p>i do get into more specific tweaks but that&rsquo;s any easy formula for improved reductions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i&rsquo;m sorry, aluminum, but i disagree. its relevant because dpi is part of the image data whether &ldquo;the web&rdquo; cares or not, and because the web is always 72dpi, whether HTML knows it or not. dpi is part of rasterized imaging, regardless of platform, whether defined or not. 72dpi is the default for most familiar onscreen environemts.</p>
<p>patty&rsquo;s web problem is the proof.</p>
<p>her images were forced down to 300 pixels by HTML. the actual images are some other size when viewed at 72dpi, before involving HTML. The only way to make an HTML encoded graphic look lossless at 300 pixels is to supply it to the HTML at 300 pixels @ 72dpi. 1 to 1. no upsizing or downsizing, and defining 72dpi is part of that data, before it gets to HTML. any other dpi will result in interpolation of some kind, up or down.</p>
<p>believe me, i&rsquo;ve been through this by trial and error. quality control dictates defining size at 72dpi for originals destined for the web at non-original sizes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, OK, good clarification. But not everyone knows how to resample a graphic properly so that it displays at the desired pixel dimensions.</p>
<p>You can take a 300dpi (let&rsquo;s say 1780x1780px) graphic and downsample it to 72dpi, and it might still be 1780x1780px. If you squoosh that graphic into your HTML with specs of 300x300px, you end up with the right display size, but the file size is larger than necessary and (as in Patty&rsquo;s case) the image looks crappy. I&rsquo;m not saying this is the right thing to do (it&rsquo;s the <em>wrong</em> thing to do), but many make this mistake.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can resample that same 300dpi (1780x1780px) graphic down to 300x300px and leave it at 300dpi and you&rsquo;ll be good to go. No squooshing, file size is reduced, all good. Just don&rsquo;t try to use that one in print cause it&rsquo;ll only be one square inch.</p>
<p>The problem, in my experience, is that many folks do the former, or screw up the latter, and end up with graphics that are not the correct dimensions and/or resolution for their website, and the result is often similar to what Patty has run into.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an opinion issue. It&rsquo;s just how it is. ;o)</p>
<p>DPI is simply a setting that some desktop publishing products use to figure out default output if not otherwise specified.</p>
<p>For instance, if you set your DPI in photoshop, it will change the PRINT size if you print directly from photoshop. It doesn&rsquo;t change the number of pixels.</p>
<p>Save that image as a  GIF or JPG to put it online, and the DPI info is gone and not needed, as the web doesn&rsquo;t have any use for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;dpi is part of the image data whether “the web” cares or not, and because the web is always 72dpi&rdquo;</p>
<p>The web isn&rsquo;t any DPI. If anything it&rsquo;s measured in PPI (pixels per inch) and that varies from monitor to monitor and computer to computer.</p>
<p>Browsers may default to 72 or 92 DPI for printing a page, but, again, that&rsquo;s a browser setting and isn&rsquo;t anything related to your images. Browsers will also use default DPI settings to interpret type sizes, but it&rsquo;s not a direct correlation to a real inch in any shape or form (so only adds to the confusion).</p>
<p>&ldquo;quality control dictates defining size at 72dpi for originals destined for the web at non-original sizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Try it. Save a 300x300 JPG and 1000dpi and at 50 dpi. Put them both on yoru web page. What do you see?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I come from print so I’m used to thinking/talking in terms of dpi not in pixels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right. DPI is a print concept. Toss it out the window when doing your web stuff. As you can see, it only confuses folks. ;o)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is in reference too, but those two images would be exatly the same on screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;how could the conversion NOT involve interpolation ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no conversion. There is still the exact same number of pixels in each image.</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s issue was that a 300x300 image was set in the HTML to view at 200x200. Browsers dont' resize images very well, so doing that results in lesser quality than if you had resized the image to 200x200 in image editing software.</p>

<p>No it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s on screen as a pixel. ;0)</p>

<p>these dpi models have guided the work of me and my collegues for as long as i can remember. the advent of HD is a big headache for us, as there are so many more pixels to address &ldquo;at 72 dpi&rdquo;.</p>

<p>okay i&rsquo;m saying dpi becasue that&rsquo;s what my photoshop calls it. but it&rsquo;s really ppi.
and 300 ppi is way more information than 72 ppi. the pixel dimensions (300x300) are &ldquo;the same&rdquo; but one is native to the screen format (72dpi) and the other is forcing interpolation (300dpi). broadcast tv is the functional equivalent of 72 ppi.</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why dpi remains relevant to me, even though my work output remains 
&ldquo;on screen&rdquo;. my head is spinning. all i know is i have to deal with this everyday 
and the results are what matters. i get results by keeping dpi in the mix, 
even though technically it&rsquo;s really ppi and even though the work never goes to print.</p>
<p>i certainly respect your expertise and i hereby officially relinquish any such claim.
perhaps i&rsquo;ve been laboring under an elaborate and unecessary work-around.
but your explanation, while &ldquo;technically&quot;correct, still doesn&rsquo;t explain what i have to deal with, and what i suspect was the reason patty&rsquo;s images were crunchy on her site.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem with both video and web is that there is no absolute like an inch to go by.  It is like units in type. A typical font is drawn at either 1000 or 2048 units. The same number of units exist no matter what the type size is. The output device determines how much of this information it can output but it can&rsquo;t change the number of units. A pixel is like a unit which can be bigger or smaller depending on the device it is viewed on. I can take my single monitor and change its resolution to several pixel depths. This will enlarge or shrink the pixel as well as cut off or add more image in the viewable area. What you like to call an inch is actually a variable that follows pixel resolution of the viewing device.</p>

<p>yea, that&rsquo;s technically incorrect. NTSC is simply a pixel dimention. It&rsquo;s not equivalent to any DPI.</p>
<p>What might be confusing is that a lot of DTP software defaults to assuming 72dpi = 100% on screen. This was only technically true when the first Macs came out (when monitors were roughly only 72ppi). It hasn&rsquo;t been true since, but software still uses it.</p>
<p>For instance, if you set an image to 72dpi in Photoshop and then tell photoshop to display it on screen at 100% you&rsquo;ll get actual size in pixels. Changing the DPI in photoshop won&rsquo;t affect the pixel dimensions of the software, but will change the 100% view in photoshop. Perhaps video editing software adopted that long ago and never let go.</p>

<p>NTCS = 484 vertical lines. I know not all of those lines are availble on screen, but for this, we&rsquo;ll assume they are.</p>
<p>For the screen to truly be 72dpi, it&rsquo;d have to be 484/72 = 6.72&quot; high. Any screen larger than that would be less than 72dpi and any screen smaller than that would be more than 72dpi. Same pixels. Just less or more per inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;and 300 ppi is way more information than 72 ppi&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not at all. It&rsquo;s just a different setting in the images meta information. What matters is the number of pixels. A 1000dpi 300x300 image and a 72dpi 300x300 image both have exactly the same amount of image data: 90,000 pixels.</p>
<p>EDIT: I can see the confusion. Your above statement is correct, 300ppi is more information than 72ppi. What you are confused about, though, is that the image on the screen doesn&rsquo;t have any ppi settings. It&rsquo;s simply a bumch of pixels. PPI is a measurment of screen pixel density&hellip;not a measurment of anything displayed on it. DPI is a measurement of print dot density&hellip;not a measurement of the electronic files that are being printed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>yes apologies to the moderator. we really did get diverted. somebody started talking about patty&rsquo;s web images. may i continue &hellip;or can we dissect this thread into two ?
what is the appropriate protocol for a big new discussion on a thread in which the original question was addressed and then diverted ?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this a setting in your video editing software?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>no, it only exists in photoshop. i create graphics and import them into aftereffects.
almost always it&rsquo;s desirable to work at very high rez (600 dpi or higher) so that aftereffects can pan &amp; scan or reduce as necessary. occasionally i have to work at a lower rez to avoid artifacts created in the video document such as unintentional moire patterns or banding in hi-rez gradations viewd in low-rez media. i always have to preview work on an NTSC monitor to see what it really looks like. the engineers i worked with back in the 90&rsquo;s consistently refered to NTSC as the functional eqivalent of 72dpi. perhaps they were just being kind and sparing me the more complex explanation.</p>
<p>sometimes i have to take frame grabs from video back into photoshop for a promotional publication. they always come in at 72 dpi at the video pixel dimensions.
screen snapshots on my mac also import into photoshop at 72 dpi with dimensions maintained.</p>
<p>when i was prepping stills for my website, my web builders requested that i supply the images at the correct pixel dimensions at 72dpi (photoshop) to avoid any forced interpolation by resizing. i tested a few and saw noticable differences online, similar to the artifacts on patty&rsquo;s site that started this diversion, hence my advice that she follow the same guidelines.</p>

I still can&rsquo;t quite wrap my head around it, but the experiment means I don&rsquo;t really need to, the proof is there. I still know I can&rsquo;t use any of these graphics for print (unless I want to print the image really small), but this does mean I no longer have to resize my graphics (for web) in 2 stages (resample to 72dpi then resize the dimensions). Thanks, Darrel, for driving this one home.</p>
<p>Stephen (and Eddie), more than a hijack I think this thread has now totally changed direction. I apologize as I think I forced it down this other path (see below for link to new thread for this topic). Hopefully Eddie got some good feedback before the thing went screwy.</p>

Your resume looks great, totally different design from everything I have seen thus far on the Internet or in the resume books. Love this one-page design even for more experienced workers; many folks have two pages but it takes so much time to read it all even in the best designed resumes. Also really like this very condensed space for skills and personal skills. Have one question: can I order this type of resume for myself? Do you have a website that I can order it from?
This resume is a great winner on all fronts!!
Thanks,
