body: "I've created multiple typefaces over the last few years  and was recently asked
  to create a typeface for a client based on the custom made logo. I've created the
  type and I've made it work in Glyphs. So good so far. \r\nThe client specifically
  said that the typeface is going to be used on web and mobile applications.  It's
  a really bold header typefaces which shouldn't be used very small because of readability,
  but I'm curious if there is any thing I should be aware of while creating or exporting
  the typeface that has to do with the online use. I know there used to be different
  ways of implementing a typeface on a website that have an effect on the typeface,
  but thats not my responsibility. \r\n\r\nI would love to know if any of you know
  if there are implications on my side while creating the typeface in Glyphs. Anyone? "

    (first) low resolution text face</a>, I did the proofing solely on screen. Looking
    at how the screen \u2013 in fact lots of screens \u2013 interprets shapes was
    important, because I learned I got better results by rethinking some of the optical
    tricks I usually apply to print faces.\r\n\r\nOn hinting: Type used online should,
    generally, have hinting instructions \u2013 most likely TrueType hinting. This
    can be done manually, or automatized. You would need to go outside of Glyphs to
    do this.\r\n\r\nOn vertical metrics: <a href=\"http://www.google.no/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&ved=0CGsQFjAG&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftypophile.com%2Fnode%2F78279&ei=DIDiUu-bG4rnygOgrICoDg&usg=AFQjCNHDkv7BA-pUU4QV86eGxWdY9zyN7g&sig2=aza0Zf4EfBwWvDTK2pL4yg&bvm=bv.59930103,d.bGQ\">Vertical
    metrics</a> for the web is a hornet\u2019s nest. \r\n\r\nOn font formats: WOFF,

    is somthing you do in css or php right? and how relevant is it with all those
    new high-ress retina-like screens? "

  body: It is something you do in a font application. If you are making quality type,
    it is very important, because the only way to have any control over the font rendering
    in Windows is hinting.

  body: "1) Vertical Metrics shortcut:\r\n&emsp;Run your font through the Font Squirrel
    generator. It will automatically measure and change the vertical metrics. Transplant
    those vertical metrics to the originals. \r\n(Caveat: I believe you still can't
    run a font with more than 600 chars in it on Font Squirrel.)\r\n\r\nNote: Make
    sure the embedding bit is set for Installable. Otherwise the font might malfunction
    if IE is a part of your test suite. \r\n\r\n2) Hinting for Truetype\r\n\r\nTT
    hinting is necessary for the font NOT to look like hell in browser's running on
    versions of Windows. As Frode testified.\r\nSo....\r\nEither output a new original
    TTF with the updated vertical metrics (changing the vertical metrics after font
    generation can be done but you'll have to turn to special tools for that - better
    they should be in the font from the start) or make a new source file (vfb, sfd)
    that has Truetype curves.  \r\nOnce you've got that, output the font as a TTF
    without any hints provided by Fontlab or FontForge or whatever other app you're
    using that might try to add TT hints. \r\nDownload ttfautohint.\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/\r\nLatest
    version is .97\r\nThere's a GUI for both Mac and Windows included. Use one of
    those - easiest way. Self explanatory. Employ common sense.\r\nThe TT hinted file
    will be a bit bigger than the original.  Check it out visually in a HTML page
    and if it looks good, it is good. \r\nA Drag and Drop test page that makes testing
    (within a limited charset at the moment) very easy, is located here:\r\nhttp://readableweb.com/tests/draganddrop/font-tester-8.1.htm\r\n\r\nYa
    want/need help? Or got a lot of fonts to process and don't have the time and/or
    expertise?\r\nDrop me a line on my blog Readableweb.com. I THINK it will make
    it to my inbox if, if Media Temple continues to behave itself.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@baxendale\r\n\r\nttfautohint relies on the same TrueType interpreter that
    exists in the open-source Ubuntu operating system.\r\nIt's been a couple of years
    in development and has become, with each new iteration, more and more capable.\r\nAs
    far as Frode's statement:\r\n\r\n><em>&ldquo;Re. autohinting: If you are making
    quality type, you need to hire a TrueType hinter or spend time learning it. Or
    wait 5\u201310 years. Or more. Or less.&rdquo;</em>\r\n\r\nWell, let me just say
    that my day in day out experience with ttfautohint - applying it to a wide variety
    of fonts and then examining the results closely in a variety of browsers on Windows
    - tells me Frode is wrong.\r\n\r\n(Plus, I doubt if we could even agree on a definition
    of what constitutes \"quality\" in a webfont. So I certainly don't want to argue
    with him further. I just don't want you to be biased before you've had a chance
    to see for yourself.)\r\n\r\nBottom line: I think you'll like the results ttfautohint
    gives you. If you don't, let me know. I'll be glad to take a look.\r\n\r\nrich"

    means, I think character in type is most important, and that is another value
    than for instance readabillity. Those two dont nececarily match... \r\n\r\nI'll
    check out the methods and see what happends!\r\nThanks !"
