  body: It may be a font but, without repeat characters, it's difficult to say, and
    could just as easily be hand lettering. Does your friend have any basis for his
    or her opinion, other than a vague recollection?

  body: "I am pretty sure it is a font. It was used on some props throughout a film
    and the characters where repeated several times throughout although they could
    be hand drawn I suppose.\r\n\r\nI think her opinion was a vague recollection,
    she mentioned thinking it was a font she had and would have a look. I haven't
    heard back from her about it yet."
