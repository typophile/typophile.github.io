    is a basic step by step guide to building icons for MacOSX and some of the considerations
    you need to bring to the project. Well worth reading for anyone interested in
    user interface design. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/" target="_blank">http://www.iconfactory.com/</a>
    is a shareware/freeware resource also useful. <BR> <BR>Joe VanDerBos <BR><a href="http://www.joevanderbos.com"
