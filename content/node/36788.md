    the colors, 3-D Effects are looking to cheap in my opinion.\r\nI would try something
    else.\r\n\r\nType \u2013\r\nif you want to go the \"squarish geometric\" direction
    have a look at Klavika (process type foundry), FF Max (fontfont), Etelka (Stormtype)."

  body: "i think the chemical compound look comes from the connecting rods between
    the balls. like a high school chemistry model.\r\ni think the image works a lot
    better in its usage on the back, w/o the lines. if you wanted a small change,
    i would suggest moving them around a little so they aren't so balanced. i know
    that loses the \"play\" reference, but it's more dynamic. you might establish
    the triangle another way...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/balls_5448.jpg]"

  body: "Hi\r\nYes. I love the idea of a circle... it also could be interesting if
    you could add a cube or a triangle or an oval. Games are all dimensional... and
    it comes in all shapes and sizes. Colors are ok. maybe try tertiary colors instead
    of primary or mustard, lilac or olive combo.. layout is clean. How about embossing.../or
    a cut out?\r\nMaybe have the type in the middle and have the shapes over the information
    like a juggler? as another alternative?\r\n\r\nAD-Shamiko"

  body: "I like it without the lines connecting the balls. The lines hold those elements
    static whereas the lack of them has movement. I don't like the blurred drop shadow
    but it makes me think light shadows for the balls would be cool. Love the \"press
    play\" under the name. I don\u2019t think the T F E and WWW in pink is needed."
