      Its hard to tell from the sample if the terminals are at an angle or not, does
      anyone know if they are?\r\n\r\nI have a bad feeling the dot of i is different
      though, and I realise this is being very particular now, its just that it would

  body: True. Looking at the stroke ends in the 'e' I see a definite angle. Also,
    the bars in the lowercase 'r' and 't' appear stubbier than in my samples of Helvetica
    and Helvetica Neue.

    in 1987, Bedford Press, San Francisco, though made and printed in Great Britain
    by the Camelot Press, Southampton. Foreward by Aaron Burns.\r\n\r\nThe only mention
    of production type is Monotype Grotesque 215 used for the text copy.\r\n\r\nThe
    dust jacket type looks slightly spread, more so than the book's title page (please
    excuse the poor repro due to a quick digital snap).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Liberated_Page_titleplate_3612.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    tend to agree that it may be pre-PostScript version which is closest to Nimbus
    Sans, perhaps off a high-end digital imagesetter or phototype (the narrow \"r\"
    clinches it).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nimbus_Sans2_5921.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeuHelvetica75_6739.png]\r\n\r\nMy

  body: "The digital versions of Helvetica nearly all come from machine composition
    companies (mainly Linotype). Machine composition was primarily used for text.
    Thus, the digital versions of Helvetica are mostly based on designs meant for
    text setting. \r\n\r\nToday, these same fonts are used for text <em>and</em> display.
    But digital Helvetica, used at display size, does not match the traditional display
    cuts, as you can see by this book title, because it is not the same design. It
    is a text design being used at a display size. I imagine most designers assume
    that Helvetica is Helvetica, until they come across something like this.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be great to see the display cuts of common typefaces digitized so designers
    could use them again. Most of them were left behind when digital type took over
    and the old type houses closed shop."

  body: "Mark, I completely agree that digital versions of display cuts would be great
    to see, though I fear the only ones who could truly appreciate them are <em>typophiles</em>.\r\n\r\nIn
    the Pre-PostScript past, designer often just specified type by type name and not
    by cut. It was frequently left to the type houses/type directors to refine the
    specifications. The majority of designers today know even less about optical scaling.\r\n\r\nWe've
    seen in many posts that designers find it difficult nowadays to justify the purchase
    of a single quality font, let alone a family. It's hard to imagine that there
    would be much of a market for display cuts since only a few can see the difference.\r\n\r\nThe
    great visual services typesetting shops provided to the advertising, graphic arts
    and broadcast industries are now lost. I think the only place you see such refinement
    is in individual custom type work and by lettering artist (such as yourself) for
    titles and logos.\r\nMay you live long and prosper!"

  body: "Display cuts were not specified out of habit. If you ordered 48 pt metal
    type repro, you had to get a display cut. The time between Helvetica's arrival
    in the late 50s (a bit later in the U.S.) and the dominance of photo type was
    very quick with digital soon thereafter. Heads done on photo typositor were made
    from display cut drawings usually but that is not to say everyone did it that
    way. A lot of phototype headings were reworked by hand as well. Mostly, hand work
    was normal then and everyone was quite used to it. Today it is all digitally futzed

    Chris' great explanations of the history and 'developments' made in the transition
    to digital type, both particularly fascinating.  \r\n\r\nIt is odd that despite
    having some knowledge about text and display cuts, I didn't at all connect or
    extend this knowledge to Helvetica. I guess, sadly (like many others I suspect),
    that I'm a casualty of the digital revolution. Despite the sad situation caused
    by the transition to digital technology, it is great to find a place where this
    knowledge is still alive and discussed passionately (and long may it go on). It
    is a very encouraging forum. \r\n\r\nI must say however that you would think someone
    would duly honour 'one the most important 20th Century typefaces' by actually
    releasing what would be the complete family. I completely agree that it would
    be great to see more display cuts made available, as it seems a particularly odd
    situation for the industry to be in, although I don't really understand industry
    - but it doesn't seem to be in its own interest (whatever that is). \r\n\r\nFunny
    enough Helvetica never was a favorite of mine, and I deep down I was hoping this
    sample was some forgotten alternative I could use instead as it immediatly felt
    better on the eye. It perhaps doesn't come across in the image, but it is nicer...\r\n\r\nI
    would be a bit lost if I discovered Herbert Spencer was using knock offs all along!\r\n\r\nCheers
