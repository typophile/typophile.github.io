    by Dave Farey, but I can see it's not a match. I couldn't find any sans with a
    slanted e and short-tailed g.\r\n\r\nStill a mystery.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Lineto, and Veer. It seems like it must come from a relatively small independent
    foundry, but this kind of techno look isn't my strongest area.\r\n\r\nAnyone else
    have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
