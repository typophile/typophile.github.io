body: "I'm on the exec of a small ultimate frisbee league in Barrie, Ontario.  We're
  looking for a new wordmark and/or logo. I reckon the wordmark is easier, so have
  been playing around with a few concepts myself. (I'm definitely not a graphic artist
  or typographer\u2014just a mechanical engineer who volunteered.) \r\n\r\nThis wordmark
  will go on our website, on jerseys, discs, and potentially other promotional stuff.
  I'd like it to be clear and legible at a distance for both small sizes (e.g., decals)
  and larger (jerseys). \r\n\r\nI'm also hoping to reflect the sport: it's co-ed and
  friendly; modern; fast, \"flow-y\", and fun.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThis is my [[http://barrieultimate.com/images/barrieultimate.com_familian.gif|first
  try]]:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barrieultimate_5838.com_familian.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  font is Familian. I like the flow and roundedness of the font, and the aspect ratio
  of the block.  However, I think this looked better in my mind's eye than when actually
  in front of me.\r\n\r\nI'm favouring my [[http://www.barrieultimate.com/images/barrieultimate.com_century_gothic.gif|second
  concept]]:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barrieultimate_6439.com_century_gothic.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  font is Century Gothic. I like that it's clean, and the very rounded characters
  remind me of the round shape of a disc.  Not separating the words is an effect that
  to me suggests modernity.\r\n\r\nFor either, it should work in with either black/white
  or in colours.  I just added the different colours in the second so that the .com
  was de-emphasized.\r\n\r\nAny feedback on these concepts would be very much appreciated.
  \ Also, any suggestions for a different font (preferably free or not too expensive)
  would also be great.  \r\n"

    least, hire a design student.

    to do it.
