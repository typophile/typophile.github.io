  and I've always been impressed with the insightful, helpful critiques offered. So
  now I\u2019d appreciate some feedback on the attached logo.\r\n\r\nThe company is
  an analytical laboratory, dealing with a large variety of materials characterization,
  field services, consulting and litigation support, and most recently software design
  (really they\u2019re all over the place).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThey wanted to simplify
  and refresh their previous logo, but still retain a level of professionalism and
  make it friendlier and approachable. The symbol references their involvement in
  all stages of the product life cycle, the 3 core business components, and is suggestive
  of a microscopy lens aperture. \r\n\r\nWe've gone through many different iterations,
  and this is the final contender. Please let me know what advice you have.  Thanks
  much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/RJLG_Logo_020711_5479.jpg]"

  body: "I think the basic idea is sound enough, the two fonts used and their weights
    match reasonably, and the spacing generally is fine (although I would let the
    logo circle overhang the bottom edge a bit more, it's onptically centered a bit
    above the text... also perhaps space out the SC Sans a bit more).\r\n\r\nTwo queries:\r\n\r\n1.
    Why all the different cases and sizes? Does the word \"Group\" have to be in small
    caps? Does the tagline? Does every word of the tagline have to be capitalised?
    CamelCase is very unfortunate visual effect.\r\n\r\n2. The logo - besides the
    rather common style - why the sickly primary-green colour? Also, look at the very
    different effect of the three counter spaces in the \"circle\" - the almost straight
    curve in the bottom-right hand corner, the flared one in the bottom-left, and
    the curve-meets-straight-line top-left. Maybe these can be made a bit more unified?
    Same with the shape of the \"leaves\" - the little one is curvy and bouncy, like
    a jumping fish, while the biggest one is practically sleeping in comparison."

  body: "To comment on the mark -- I realize and appreciate it's a M\xF6bius strip,
    but a twisted strip is pretty generic as far as its use in logos goes. Rogers
    has it, Microsoft uses it for various products, lots and lots of other logos have
    it, just flip through Logopond. It is just not distinct on its own.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rogers_logo_5743.jpg]"

  body: "Great comments from Birdseeding. The \"ee\" vs. \"ROUP\" thing really stuck
    out for me - try it with either lowercase or small caps for BOTH. And I'd definitely
    try putting the \"DELIVERING SCIENTIFIC RESOLUTION\" in all-small-caps, without
    the big \"D\", \"S\" and \"R\". And the neon green feels painfully bright to me.
    Not sure how it'd look in print.\r\n"

  body: 'agree with the generic mark. you might get something similar if you stylize
    the letters RJ? maybe create somekind of lens/aperture feel out of the letters.
    both have a nice curved feel to them. '

  body: "Agreed about the all small-caps for the tagline. The word group is in small
    caps as a way to slightly emphasis the the company\u2019s combined expertise.
    The ceo has always wanted the company to be presented as a \"group\". However,
    other concepts that placed greater emphasize on group were nixed and this very
    subtle approach was settled on. \r\n\r\napankrat hola \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen
    the Rogers logo before, thanks. Agreed it is somewhat generic, they are fond of
    it however as it does meet a lot of their criteria.  I\u2019ve tried RJ combos,
    maybe I\u2019ll revisit that. I\u2019ll see what I can do\u2026 \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the comments!  I\u2019ll try to post an update later. \r\n"

  body: "Having the word group in the name presents the company as a group \u2014
    you don't need to emphasize it. Trying to emphasize it with small caps also just
    looks silly.\r\n\r\nSide note \u2014 apparently something with the image does
    not play well with Chrome, because when I was reading the comments and everyone
    was saying the mark was green I thought I had suddenly gone color blind. Then
    I checked the thread in firefox and safari and found the problem was with Chrome.

    small case letters included of course.
