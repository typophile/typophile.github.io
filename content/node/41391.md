  \r\n\r\nFont Bureau predicts it will be McCain vs Obama. Maybe they'll review the
  Patriots and Giants logos in next week's Globe?  "

  body: "Interesting that the Globe would pick type designers to comment, rather than
    graphic designers. We must be going up in the world.\r\nNice job by the guys in
    keeping it simple, explaining some features and not assuming prior knowledge,
    but too bad they didn't ID the typefaces -- that's kinda dumbing it down."

  body: Well, the Globe is set in Font Bureau fonts, isn't it? It would make sense
    then, that they'd have Sam & Cyrus in their rolodex.
