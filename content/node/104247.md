  this a problem?"

  body: Sight unseen, my general advice would be to shorten the descenders accordingly.
    This is often appropriate for bolder weights anyway. But I do wonder why you aren't
    aiming to keep your x-height consistent across the family.

  body: "Great precedent thread(s).\r\n\r\nOne thing I would posit here is that -since
    fonts are typically used hierarchically- it is the Regular that largely dictates
    vertical space usage/efficiency. Ergo: making a subordinate weight's descenders
    shorter gains you nothing (and in fact weakens boumas).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    problem?"

  body: Thanks everyone. I made the descenders a bit shorter, so that they in the
    boldest weight have at least the same length as the ascenders..
