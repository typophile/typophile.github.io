body: "Hi all.\r\nI have a question as to whether or not it would be worth it to release
  a face I've had sitting on my hard drive for 8+ years. \r\n\r\nThe font is basically
  a reproduction of the Van Doesburg Cafe Aubette lettering which The Foundry seems
  to have also duped (and I can't say I agree with some of their design decisions).
  My version is actually quite different than theirs and has my own little twists
  on the theme. I would also be making several weights and possibly widths to make
  mine more versatile.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Do we need another Van Doesburg replica?
  Should I bother cleaning it up and fleshing out the weights?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If I may suggest, Matthew, do what you feel like doing. Complete it ,then
    decide for yourself what you will do with that project, you don't need our approval!  If
    you judge it to be worthy of distribution then do all you can to have it be so...

  body: True. I guess I've been second guessing myself more lately as I'm more weary
    of wasting time on unworthy subjects. I'm going to play with it some more...

  body: Matthew - All the Foundry's "revivals" are a little sketchy. I have someone
    telling me their Ballmer is completely unauthorized by the family of the designer.
    Meanwhile, P22 is a more responsible about such things. They have <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PY.114299.0.0">DeStijl</a>
    which is definitely it's own thing. I say go.

  body: I agree Stephen. After inspecting the other versions closely, it appears to
    me like neither really hits the mark.

    all, that was almost 100 years ago.\r\nEboy and Minimum are in the Doesburg groove.\r\nI
    did a \"Doesburg\" version of Panoptica.\r\nWhat would be relevant right now?"

  body: I don't know, the Aubette lettering still stands strong today despite it's
    age. I think it's as relevant as ever. A faithful representation with multiple
    weights and widths will be a useful tool for people either looking to replicate
    the De Stijl look or I could even see it used in a modern hip-hop magazine.
