body: "Hi guys, \r\n\r\nI'm just about to start doing research for my BA Graphic Design
  dissertation/thesis at Central St Martins in London. My topic as of now is \"The
  Evolution of American Hand Lettering In the 20th Century\" - this will probably
  change as I go along. It's an incredibly broad topic, and I want to narrow it down
  at some point, but I would like to determine my direction according to my research.
  As a starting point, I have picked out the following books and essays:\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAmerican
  Type Design and Designers\r\nby David Consuegra\r\n\r\nHandwriting in America: A
  Cultural History\r\nby Tamara Plakins Thornton\r\n\r\nScript and Scribble: The Rise
  and Fall of Handwriting\r\nby Kitty Burns Florey\r\n\r\nAn Elegant Hand: The Golden
  Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy\r\nby William E. Henning\r\n\r\nHandwritten:
  Expressive Lettering in the Digital Age\r\nby Steven Heller\r\n\r\nEdward Fella:
  Letters on America\r\nby Lewis Blackwel\r\n\r\nHouse Industries\r\nby House Industries\r\n\r\nAmerican
  Modernism: Graphic Design, 1920-1960\r\nby R. Roger Remington\r\n\r\nThe Evolution
  of American Typography (Design Quarterly 148)\r\nby Mildred Friedman\r\n\r\nThe
  Education of a Typographer\r\nby Steven Heller \r\n\r\nThe Golden Age of Hand Lettering
  In American Advertinsing\r\nby Nick Shinn\r\n\r\nAmerican Graphic Design Expression:
  The Evolution of American Typography\"\r\nby Katherine McCoy\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't
  bought any of these books yet, as I am unsure if they all \"fit\" with the topic,
  and therefore worth spending money on. I am wondering if you guys have any thoughts
  on the list so far, anything that should be added or subtracted? Is this an OK starting
  point?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAnders\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    search out Paul Shaw's chronology that he did for the Washington Calligraphers
    Guild (Scripsit). It is, without a doubt, the most incisive look at both lettering
    and calligraphy... two very different things. And it is the least agenda driven
    retrospective.\r\n\r\nIt will give you more names than you can search in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: There's very little in your list on commercial lettering, which comes into
    focus in the Leach book. And commercial lettering was at the centre of the profession,
    as most large text was hand lettered for the first half of the century at least.
    That's an awful lot of work in posters, advertising, brochures and packaging,
    not to mention one-offs such as tickets and show cards. Don't forget greetings
    cards.

  body: "I would suggest \"Lines,\" a book by Tim Ingold. This book is not written
    for a design audience -- it's geared towards anthropologists, but is written for
    a general audience. This will give you zero specific information about handlettering
    in 20th century America, but it will give you a broader picture of how the living
    gesture of the human hand has been replaced with a static and unmoving \"concept
    holder\" in modern typography.\r\n\r\nThe other book I would recommend is \"The
    Stroke,\" by Gerrit Noordzij. Again, this has nothing to do with commercial handlettering
    in 20th century America, but provides a good base for understanding the relationship
    of lettering and type."

    manuals I've got. It is mainly sign painting, posters and showcards so might not
    be as refined as what you are interested in. The Atkinson 75 Alphabets is one
    of the oldest, from about 1914 but I've got books like this going up the '80s.
    Also a lot of British ones, such as Cecil Wade, for comparison. PM me if you're
    interested in having a look. I'm in Harrow in NW London.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SignBooks_5185.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "Wow, I am astounded by the feedback I've received on this thread so far,
    thank you very much guys! I've just ordered a few books off Amazon, amongst those
    \"The Stroke\" and \"Lines\", which both looks really interesting. I am planning
    on getting Dangerous Curves when I get back to London (in Norway for the next
    3 weeks) - looks amazing by the way. I have also contacted The Calligraphers Guild,
    to see if I can get hold of a few of their previous issues of Scripsit. The only
    problem is that they only seem to accept checks, which are hardly in use over
    here anymore.\r\n\r\nNick: I know there's little in my list on commercial lettering,
    which was what I initially wanted to write about, but I haven't found that much
    info on it. I know that my college library has a copy of Leach's book, so I will
    look into that when I get back. Also, my tutor recommended \"America\" by Baudrillard,
    since it touches on commercial and consumer society in America (not from a typographic
    point of view though).\r\n\r\nJustin: Those books looks amazing! I will definitely
    be interested in having a look, I'll PM you as soon as I get back.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thank you so much for the information you've provided me with so far guys!!\r\n\r\nAnders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think your primary challenge will be bridging the content from the early
    part of the century via printed matter through the online stuff from the 1990s
    . . .\r\n\r\nYou may also consider looking through the Taschen book series of
    All-American Ads from 1900 through 1980 to observe the 'aesthetic' evolution of
    hand lettering and its use in commercial advertising as well as its non-printed
    advertising use . . .\r\n\r\nYour thesis will likely find correlations between
    era related design trends and the use of hand lettering but while advertisements
    aren't the end all be all of your thesis, it's likely the best documented . .
    . You cannot ignore non-advertising sources of hand lettering from showcards through
    pinstriping through painted billboards and signage and non-commercial lettering
    such as the evolution of modern calligraphy and the height of lettering at the
    end of the Century revealed itself in millions of 'scrappers' who took the baton
    of hand lettering and evolved a new interest and awareness in hand lettering .
    . .\r\n\r\nYou're correct in your initial post that this is a broad topic but
    nobody has really addressed any lettering that occurred after 1970 so far in the
    thread specifically and there were a TON of changes just in the last 30 years
    of the century . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: "hi,\r\n\r\ni would recommend also looking at traditional engraving styles,
    initially these were all hand cut, just copied.  later this process was mediated
    by a machine (pantograph, as it is still today) and then digital.  but the styles
    were developed over time through the act of engraving.\r\n\r\nlook at bergling's
    books still available through gem city press.  i've always wondered where the
    originals for this wacky, huge body of work came from.  all i could ever find
    out was that, according to his obit, he migrated to chicago at the turn of the
    last century then out to CA for a bit but, supposedly, returned for the white
    fair, worlds expo in the windy city.  but i am not sure this is accurate.\r\n\r\nanyway,
    the books are fun and cheap.\r\n\r\nalso, there's an illustrator's blog with loads

    with something like "The Logo, Font & Lettering Bible," one end would be the extreme
    of theory, and the other end the extreme of practicality. But I think for a research
    project, just looking at examples of 20th century American type isn''t going to
    lead to any meaningful idea unless there''s a lens to view it through.'

  body: I've discussed by opinion of "Elements" at length on Typophile, that thread
    is probably around somewhere. My opinion of the Stroke is that it is an over-intellectualized
    analysis. As someone who has learned by doing, at a time when there was no internet
    and very few resources on type design, I had to come to my own conclusions about
    things. I just don't find the book useful to me, that's all. Perhaps you find
    it enlightening.

    much use to someone with years of experience, but for a designer working on his
    first font it\u2019s great to have someone explain exactly why all those intuitive
    aspects of drawing with a pen can be used to develop, examine, and critique a
    type design. But James is right\u2014it\u2019s not relevant to this research,
    at least not enough to justify reading it over something else. A BA thesis just
    doesn\u2019t offer enough time to read everything\u2014trust me, I went way overboard
