  body: "Susana, I'm afraid that \"old\" doesn't help much. 3 years old? 30? 130?\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, does anyone know of a decent search engine that <em>only</em> returns
    hits for <em>exactly</em> what you've typed. The common search engines now are
    converting my search for SOGIEDAD ALCOLERA (Catalonian?) into SOCIEDAD ALCOHOLIKA
    (grrrr ...). It used to be that you could put your query into parenthesis and
    only get exact hits. Now they try to guess what you <em>really</em> wanted ...
    and are often wrong."

    of variations including \r\nALCOHOLERA Catalonian -ALCOHOLIKA \r\nI had to delete
    the word SOGIEDAD, which Google really does not like, to get something remotely
    resembling the topic. But no matching logo or label.\r\nUPDATE\r\nGoogling\r\nlabel
    ALCOHOLERA Catalonian Catalu\xF1a -ALCOHOLIKA\r\nat least produced some Catalonian

    you will find a modern match.

    and put it together with a cleaned up excerpt from your link\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CompareSM_3421.jpg]\r\nI'm
    not certain what to make of it.\r\nYour photo seems to date from 1909, which is
    very consistent with the style of lettering.\r\nThe ID request lettering is somewhat
    similar, at least for _A_, so it could perhaps be from the same era.\r\nIt would
    be possible to try re-lettering the ID request in this style, with the addition
    of the flourishes for _S_, _G_, _A_, and _C_, but I definitely see no matching
    font. Except for the _G_ mentioned in my previous post.\r\nDon"
