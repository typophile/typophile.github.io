  might build a font proofer/tester, the sort that appear on most founder sites to
  test fonts in different weights and size. An example would be this at process type
  foundry.\r\n\r\nhttp://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/seravek/try-it\r\n\r\nI could
  do it using Flash but I wanted a fully html site.\r\n\r\n\r\nttmt."

    to have a go at this myself so I could have more control. I have a bit of development
    experience but I need a few ideas about how this might work.\r\n\r\nfrode frank
    - yes I would be interested. I would like to produce something myself but I'd
    love to see how you have achieved it."
