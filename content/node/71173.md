  of different languages. I haven't had any problems with danish, french, dutch, swedish...
  so far but now I have to work with the bulgarian one and I can't seem to find a
  solution.\r\n\r\nThe \"how to cook\" instructions can be done with helvetica or
  something similar so it's not a problem. The difficulty comes when I have to write:
  microowave or oven / always crunchy using Market and Impact. Have you got any clue
  of the closest type with cyrillic characters I can use?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!!\r\n\r\nAlex"
