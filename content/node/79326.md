body: "I thought I would share excerpts from a paper I recently presented for my Research
  Methods class in the Masters of Education in Arts & Learning program I am currently
  taking.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this Masters program in to investigate, propose and
  document ways in how the creative arts influence, enhance and/or improve the learning
  process, and the first project I proposed was to investigate alternative methods
  for teaching the alphabet. This paper describes the first excerise I developed for
  the classroom (young early readers or adults learning foreign/non-latin alphabets).\r\n\r\nHere
  are some excerpts, samples and illustrations from the paper. If anyone is interested
  in a copy of the full paper or prepared source materials for conducting the exercise
  with students, please contact me through Typophile's \"contact\" feature.\r\n\r\n<strong>Learning
  New Glyph Systems:</strong>\r\nExperimental Research in Recognition and Retention\r\n\r\nWritten
  communications use glyphs as the essential component for making visual expressions
  of language.  Though the scope of modern and ancient glyph systems is immense, my
  personal and professional interest lie in modern phonetic alphabet systems, in particular,
  the stylistic variations found within Latin based alphabets.  Due in part to my
  training and experience in graphic design and typography, I am deeply interested
  in how others see and interpret words (hand-written, printed or constructed) and
  how their arrangement and treatment can influence or affect the reader.  \r\nI care
  about understanding more about written language since I grow increasingly aware
  of how new technologies affect not only how we communicate, but also what and why
  we communicate.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hypothesis</strong>\r\nWriting systems were originally
  created, learned and practiced by inscribing glyphs and letters through repetitive
  hand movements utilizing various tools and implements.  Teaching students an alphabet
  system through repetitive hand-copying of individual glyphs is the most common and
  wide spread method used.  Newer methods of teaching alphabets have developed within
  the last fifty years which do not involve hand writing individual letters or words
  but instead use student interaction with glyph images through use of key pads.  The
  selection of a glyph or whole word with the single touch of a key or click of a
  mouse is significantly different than manually writing or constructing a glyph (letter)
  or word.  The first question that comes to mind is what is gained or lost by using
  one method of teaching students an alphabet over another method. \r\n\r\nIt is my
  hypothesis that the physical act of writing (manually constructing glyphs and letter-forms)
  aids in the initial learning of an alphabet system and that certain writing exercises
  can improve the speed of glyph recognition when learning new alphabets.  I am biased
  toward methods using drawing, hand writing and physical construction of glyphs and
  letters, since as an artist, I feel there are multiple and complex processes involved
  (visual and motor skills).  It is my suspicion that methods which use key pad or
  mouse click interactions with screen imagery of glyphs and letters might yield faster
  results in glyph recognition and with longer retention.  In order to assess statistical
  data regarding advantages or disadvantages of one method of teaching alphabet systems
  over another it is necessary to establish a baseline or norm for learning basic
  alphabets.  While I am certain that such data exists, it is not the purpose of this
  paper to present comparative results between methods.  Instead, the intent of this
  project is to present an alternative method for teaching alphabets to students then
  \ collect data which can be used for comparison with my future projects and experiments
  in developing new methods for teaching glyph, letters and alphabet systems.\r\n\r\nThe
  exercise I have developed involves hand copying a four to six letter word consisting
  of characters (glyphs) not previously known to the student. Instead of the repetitive
  copying exercise commonly used by other teaching methods, the student only copies
  the word once, but is challenged with creating a copy that embodies the meaning
  or expression of that word.  With this method more emphasis is placed on stimulating
  cognitive and creative centers of the brain as opposed to rote methods using mechanical
  centers through repetition and hand-eye coordination.\r\n\r\nWhat I hope to learn
  from this project is that focused methods involving creative expression will yield
  quicker recognition of new glyph than mechanical repetition and rote methods would.
  As stated previously, this paper will not present comparative data, but only the
  results of the exercise I have developed.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>(Excerpts from Materials,
  Lesson Plan, Samples and Results)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction to exercise.</strong>\r\nSubjects
  were given a brief introduction to the exercise by stating that words can convey
  meaning or expression solely by the way they are presented visually, despite the
  ability to read or understand the word itself.  To help demonstrate the point, subjects
  were each given a word in a foreign language (English translation provided on source
  card), written in the alphabet of that culture.  Then the subjects were asked to
  draw their given word in a manner that expresses the nature or essence of that word.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Armn-bird-sample-card_5729.png]<em>Sample
  language/alphabet source card used for exercise.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Post drawing
  exercise review.</strong>\r\nAfter the exercise, all drawing were lined up for review.
  \ The subjects were asked as a group if they could identity any of the drawings
  by their respective English translation.  One by one, the English translations used
  for the exercise were read aloud and the subjects were asked to identity which drawing
  matched the word.  (Students were asked to refrain from identifying their own drawing).\r\n\r\nSamples
  of students' drawings --[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bird_Monica_6272.png]Armenian

  words were drawn, each word comprised of four to six non-Latin letters.   A total
  of four languages were used for the exercise, each having its own unique alphabet
  system.  Of the eight drawings reviewed by the subjects as a group, each foreign
  word was correctly identified by their respective English translation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Glyph/letter
  recognition test.</strong>\r\nAfter a period of approximately three to four hours
  after the drawing exercise, the glyph recognition test was administered.  The subjects
  were not give any indication prior or during the drawing exercise that such a test
  would be given.  The purpose in not disclosing the test phase to subjects beforehand
  was to collect data on how well subjects could recall glyphs solely based on the
  previous drawing exercise.  \r\n\r\nPrinted sheets with complete alphabets for each
  of the foreign languages used in the drawing exercise were distributed to the subjects.
  \ The subjects were then asked to circle or mark any of the letters they recognize
  from the word they drew.  After approximately five to ten minutes, the test sheets
  were collected and subsequently used for the collected of data for this paper.\r\n\r\n<strong>Glyph/letter
  recognition test data</strong>\r\nA total of 41 foreign characters were used for
  the 8 words used in the drawing exercise.  A total of 28 out of the 41 characters
  were correctly identified by the group as a whole, resulting in an average score
  of 68.3%.  The best score achieved was 100% by one of the subjects or 6 out of 6
  foreign characters identified correctly.  The poorest score was 50% or 2 out of
  4 foreign characters identified correctly by one subject, and 3 out of 6 characters
  identified correctly by another subject within their own respective drawings.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong>\r\nAlthough
  there was no comparison of data between one method over another when teaching alphabet
  systems, I believe there is enough data to support further exploration into methods
  that employ creative interpretation of words while teaching the alphabet.  One of
  the more interesting outcomes of the drawing exercise was the 100% success in identifying
  the meaning of a foreign word solely by the graphic treatment of the non-Latin letters.
  \ One might describe it as pure typography when the meaning of a word can be conveyed
  even without understanding the language or its alphabet.  The group as a whole seemed
  to experience the \u201Cguess the word\u201D session as very positive, while on
  the other hand seemed more stressed and anguished during the glyph recognition test.\r\n\r\nBy
  selecting non-Latin phonetic alphabets for the exercise, I was able to place the
  subjects into a situation similar to what children first learning the alphabet or
  non-English speaking students might experience when learning to read and write in
  English. That in itself is a useful experience for teachers and may foster an understanding
  of how difficult learning our language might really be."
