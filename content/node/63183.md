  show in the image. I'm fairly certain the on there is Travis, but my company doesn't
  own Travis and there's really not enough money in the budget on this title for buying
  it. So my question is, if not Travis, what face is that and short of that do you
  have any suggestions for something similar?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
