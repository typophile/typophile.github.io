body: "You'll find below a screenshot from a Word 2010 document, where I typed two
  'b's, both with the 26 pt Cambria Math font (both characters have bold). The character
  on the left was typed using the text editor. The one on the right was obtained inside
  the Equation Editor.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/equation editor
  bug_3871.png]\r\n\r\nI believe the first glyph is 0x0A86 and the second is the glyph
  0x0888, but I can't understand the criteria for these options. I would also appreciate
  if somebody could confirm whether the glyphs mentioned above are correct.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    from Cambria whereas the glyph on the left seems artificially emboldened and slanted.
    This is obviously not an explanation, but might be relevant in finding one."
