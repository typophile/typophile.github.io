  and at the bottom, I put \"All work copyright 2009.\"\r\n\r\nWith the new year coming
  up, do I just change it to 2010, or do I say 2009-2010?"

  body: "I've seen some websites that use the second option, i.e., 2009-2010, to indicate
    that not all of the work was created in 2010.\r\n\r\n[I can think of a similar
    situation: when old music albums are reissued with bonus tracks and/or remastering,
    the copyright reflects the original year the album was released, plus the year
    of the reissue (not all record companies do this, though). For example: \"\xA9
    1975, 2009, X Records.\" This, to me, is the best way to go about it, as it lets
    you know the original release date, and that you are looking at a reissue.]"

  body: If a piece of work was created in 2009, then the copyright date for that piece
    is 2009. It doesn't change just because the year changes. If you want a blanket
    statement that covers all pieces, then you can either use an en dash for a continuous
    range or a comma-delimited list of applicable years.
