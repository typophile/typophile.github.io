    posted this same question here awhile ago.  I think most of what you are showing
    here is custom.  A nice contemporary monoline script is needed in my opinion."

  body: You could probably find something similar to "liquid," [[http://www.letterbox.net.au/research/res_fo_terital.html|Terital]]
    is close, and the type used for "branding" looks similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/orion-md/|Orion]].
    But the two on the right are really unique. Closest I can think of is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_chambers_sans_ot/|Chamber
    Sans Italic]] with ligatures, you might get close.
