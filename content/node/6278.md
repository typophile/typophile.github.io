body: After making a kerning run through my current project, I fired up TextEdit on
  Mac OS X 10.2 to check out the results. I was a bit shocked and fully dismayed to
  see nary a kern. Adobe InDesign 2.0, on the other hand, handles the kerning just
  fine. <BR> <BR>After a bit more exploring, it seems clear that you have to choose
  a platform. Apple supplied fonts kern only with apps that use their text engine,
  no kerning in sight in InDesign. FontLab generated fonts, OpenType in my case, kern
  great in InDesign but fall over in TextEdit. <BR> <BR>Is this really the sad state
  of type on Mac OS X? After finally settling on OpenType as a crossplatform format,
  are we going to have to go back to offering multiple downloads, one for each text
  engine? Or is there a way to insert an Apple format kerning table into my OpenType
  font?

  body: I think it&#39;s because TextEdit throws away kerning and doesn&#39;t care
    about OpenType features. It ignores them. It prefers to see Apple&#39;s own AAT
    tables built into the font. So that&#39;s why TextEdit likes Apple&#39;s own fonts.
    <BR> <BR>InDesign, on the other hand, is OT-savvy, but not AAT-savvy, I think.
    So it&#39;s the other way around. There is less than a handful of fonts that have
    both OT and AAT tables &#40;ok, only one, I guess&#41;. I suspect that most people
    are going to ignore AAT and develop OT tables for their own fonts, regardless
    of which technology is better. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m totally guessing. <BR> <BR>Alan

  body: Maybe it&#39;s time to dust of my programmer hat and write an app to sync
    the two kerning tables. Apple has some command line tools for OS X to help develop
    AAT fonts. They may lend themselves to being scripted.

    me, I got it wrong. I was thinking of the one that supports both OT and Graphite.
    Can&#39;t remember the name, though.'
