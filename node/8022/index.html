<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello <br> <br>My name is Ragnar and I am from Iceland. I am currently studying graphic design at the Iceland Academy of the Arts for a Bachelor Degree and will be graduating in spring 2005. Right now I am wondering how I should continue my education. <br> <br>I have a lot of interest in typographic design. Not designing typefaces as such but the act of designing with typefaces. <br> <br>So I was wondering if someone here could point to me to schools that offer MA programs in typographic design or something similar. They can be anywear in the world. I am open to anything! <br> <br>Thanks alot, <br> <br>Ragnar Freyr <br><a href=http://www.onrushdesign.com target=_blank>www.onrushdesign.com</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Do you have a financial limitations? Must it be in the EU? Are you dead-set on formal education? Have you considered doing an internship first, one that might perhaps be with a company that does a lot of typographic design? Do you admire any typographic designers? Do they have internships?</div>

<div class=commentbody>What languages do you speak? This could be a bonus and/or limitation in the short run. For instance, if you don't speak French or German, you wouldn't be able to start at most French or German institutions right away. Of course, you speak English, which will allow you to study just about everywhere else. <br> <br>If you are looking for typographic, and not type design programs, Switzerland has several choices (but that is both cliche</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is off the topic a bit, but, <br> <br>Is type design getting more "popular" recently or is typophile simply making a small, passionate community heard louder (even if only to each other). It seems like there is an ever increasing number of posts regarding people interested in pursuing places of higher education that offer type design. <br> <br>I have only been hanging out here for the last 11 months, so I don't know how much this has come up in the past. While there is a lot of debate over the vast amount of type currently available, it is clear that the more demand there is for type education</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think Typophile is a good indicator of general popularity. But radio shows and newspapers certainly are! And there has indeed been an mini-explosion of type talk in mass media lately. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think that teaching type design is becoming more popular. That is why more institutions are starting to do it, even if a few bad apples like ENSAD axed it out of their programs altogether recently. <br> <br>Of course, before the 1980s, lettering and "type" design (what one might call typeface concept design) was a much more integral part of general graphic design education. In general, I would wager that even in this present renewal, far less people are being exposed to the details of letter drawing than in the past. However, the current "type design" educational opportunities, where one can be taught aesthetics, theory, and practice all at once, and in the span of a year at that, is ground-breakingly new, in my opinion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi everyone <br> <br>On the subject of type design programs - are there any suggestions on schools/locations? <br> <br>I am currently in the US and have been a very active graphic designer the 6 years since completing my BFA (including collegiate adjunct facility experience). I wish to attend a MFA program with an emphasis on type face design. <br> <br>I appreciate any assitance!</div>
