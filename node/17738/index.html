There's always one or two teams that fly under the radar, that could be one of them.

<div class=commentbody>Chris, I was not meaning to be (too) bitchy. It's just that Mr Daniels has the Seahawks helmet as his identifier, and for a spell also had the SuperBowl XL logo alongside it. I notice that the SuperBowl logo has disappeared, while the helmet remains, which says to me that Mr Daniels is a true fan of his beloved team, and I applaud that. He doesn't need the Seahawks to be the Galactic Champions for him to love them. (As a Montrealer, and once fan of the Expos, I know all about sports-based disappointment.)</div>

Not really. That would be the logical approach if all the letterforms had uniform widths, but that's not the case. For example, the <strong>I</strong> doesn't occupy the same width as the <strong>O</strong>. So the <strong>M</strong> in a <strong>MI</strong> ligature must be different from the <strong>M</strong> in a <strong>MO</strong> ligature. As Ken worked through the task of drawing all 1,400 ligatures, he would adjust forms as needed to make each individual ligature look perfect. Automatically assembled ligatures would not have had that same attention to detail and the organic qualities of the face would have been lost. In cases like this, automation always yields to aesthetics.
Because the decision was made to hand build all the ligatures, we never really looked into assembling them on the fly. I have some ideas about how that could be done with a combination of contextual lookups, kerning and <em>lots</em> of alternate glyphs, but it would be a big can of worms.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chester,
Si left me (I am a life-long Steeler fan) a message of congratulations on the Steelers win within minutes of the games end. He did not hedge or woulda-coulda-beened me or anything (and there were plenty of officials screwing up to complain about). He took it like a man and offered his congratulations like a man. I admire him for it and gladly allow him to wear his Seahawks helmet with pride for as long as he wants.

Si was probably thinking of the Apple AAT version of Zapfino, which Ross and I produced. Adam was responsible for the OT version with its clever pseudo-random stuff. Of course, no mention of either current version of Zapfino should exclude Akira Kobayashi, who worked on the design revision with Hermann.
If I were to form an OT team for Si's list, I think it would have to be the Hebrew Hounds with Ralph Hancock, or maybe the Torah Tigers. All this fancy Latin display typography is a nice light pre-season workout, but I really don't think you've broken a sweat if the game doesn't require additions to Unicode, changes to the way VOLT works, changes to the way Uniscribe works, and six months in the locker room listening to people shout about why Phoenician is or is not the same thing as Hebrew.
_
Anyway, kudos indeed to Tal, and congratulations to whoever won that silly game with all the padding. I leave you with <a href=http://gvod.blogspot.com/2006/02/rugby-tackles-ouch.html>a real sport</a>. Oh my goodness, they're not wearing helmets! Somebody stop them before someone gets hurt!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Si, your "current favorite fun font", Local Gothic, is actually not published by House, Adobe, or Tal, but by Orange Italic, Christian Schwartz's foundry. Tal was the genius behind the OT "random" programming.
And as for all of the stuff about the Steelers and Seahawks: I was being flippant.</div>
