  it on the Know How Tallinn 2009 site(http://www.trtr.ee/themes.php), and I really
  like the handdrawn feeling to it. \r\nDoes anyone know the name of this font? I
  feel like I've seen in before in some magazines. \r\nIt resembles SwiftEF a bit,
  but more organic and loose.\r\n\r\nOn the photo it is the blue font, the big one...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/know-how-1_3989.jpg]"
