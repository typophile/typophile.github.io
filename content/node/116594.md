body: I'm thinking about getting an expert's opinion on fonts that will work for my
  existing website. The site is a business tool with a subdued, late-1800s motif.
  This would not be an extended project, just an hour or so of your time. A video
  Skype call might work best. Please reply, however you like, with your rate if you're
  interested.
