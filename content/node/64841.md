  released my first typeface: Stickley Text Pro, and thanks for the help and support
  - especially to jackson and paragraph for the seeds of clarity to get me functional
  - to all the random conversations that helped along the way.\r\n\r\nYou can find
  it here: http://www.p22.com/ihof/stickley.html\r\n\r\nSo, thanks. Hope you like
  it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4550.png]"
