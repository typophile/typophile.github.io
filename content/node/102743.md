  Style...Adams Brothers architecture from the mid 1700s to early 1800s.  Thanks!

    rarer bird (and I don''t believe it was ever digitized, assuming you''re looking
    for something for current application). '

  body: "@Kent & Ingrid...\r\n\r\nWell, there are still a few people in the U.S. setting
    Linotype, and if they have the Georgian mats, could set copy. If this is an art
    book, there might not be that much copy. With \"modern\" technology, repro could
    be pulled from the metal type, so the printing could be offset, whatever. \r\n\r\nThe
    type \"size\" could be changed slightly in camera -- no different than with a
    digital setting. You have to pay attention to the measure and word space values
    with this trick...\r\n\r\nYou could certainly wind up with a different look from
    the slick architectural productions common today, which may or may not be what
    you're after....\r\n\r\nIf you want to go with PostScript/OpenType fonts, Carter's
    digital version of Monticello might also  fit the need.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nYou
    might get up with some of the designers at the University of Georgia press --
    Athens isn't too far from Atlanta. There is a guy who just retired who is pretty
    knowledgeable about type & typesetting. He set many of the Press' books that were
    done in house, and this during the days of transition of photocomp-PostScript-OpenType.
    He's on the young side for retirement, & might just be looking for a project."

  body: Thank you so much you three. This gives me some great information! I'm working
    on an assignment for design class due on Wednesday and on last Wednesday's class
    my teacher made a serious point about my type choices. Yikes!

  body: Yes, but the budget available for, say, an art book put out by a society or
    museum is rather greater than for a class project.

    academic at this point, but . . . I doubt there is anyone in the U.S. with mats.
    Jones designed Georgian for British Linotype, and as far as I recall it was never
    big in the U.S. \u2014 in fact may not have even been distributed here (certainly
    no promotion or inclusion in any American specimens that I\u2019ve seen).\r\n\r\nLike
    I said, a rare bird. "

  body: There was a graphic quality to the Adam style (e.g. walls decorated with panels
    of low-relief molded frames) which informed a lot of early twentieth century typography,
    in particular involving layouts structured with decorative borders and type ornaments.
    The 1923 Linotype manual shows fine distinctions between different historical
    typefaces and the kind of ornaments, borders and decorations appropriate to each.
    That manual is online.
