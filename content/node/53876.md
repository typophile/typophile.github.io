    this guy who seems to be using it for something mobile phone related. Recent blog
    entry but I think he is in Azerbaijan.\r\n\r\n[[http://nahidthemes.azeriblog.com/2009/01/09/my-used-font-planet-e-style]]\r\n\r\nMost
    Google references for that name will be music related, about the Detroit record
    label."
