  body: "It\u2019s a variation of Times, perhaps a typewriter version as opposed to
    a computer typeface (something about your sample suggests ink on paper, not toner
    on paper). Unfortunately, that combination of numerals and letters doesn\u2019t
    appear to match a single digital typeface.\r\n\r\nBerthold used to market a version
    of Times (Times BQ) that is very close to your sample\u2014save for the numerals\u2014but
    it is no longer on the market:\r\nhttps://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Berthold&ffam=Times%20BQ%20-%20Roman&fid=8bc0de76663723fe01f1974619d55915\r\n\r\nIf
    you pair the letters from Times with the numerals from Symbol, you can approximate
    the look:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/symbol/\r\n "

  body: "Thanks K.C.\r\nI suspected this may be the case, because there are about
    6 other fonts that I'm interesting in featured in similar documents that didn't
    make it to digital format.  One of them is called Boldface by IBM and was used
    on IBM typewriters such as the Composer and Executive.  I'm considering creating
    digital copies of those fonts, but then there are copyright issues and I don't
    know the origins of those designs, making contact difficult.\r\n\r\nI agree it
    does look like a variation of the Times format, but with a distinctive and very
    round 'o', a wide 's' with a flattened top and thick upper ends to the top right
    of the 'm', 'n' & 'r'.  The original document may have been typed or come from
    a letterpress (or whatever mechanical method was used back then), but I think
    the version I scanned was printed or photocopied.  I'm not 100% sure though, so
    it may have been an original master."
