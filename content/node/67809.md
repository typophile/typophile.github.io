  body: "I could be wrong, but AFAIK when you handle the kerning through Robofab you
    can only control the values of the first master. The kerning value amounts of
    the remaining masters will be the same as the first master. Therefore, you might
    have to use [[http://robofab.org/howto/lowlevel.html|Robofab's naked() method]]
    and go from there, or use FontLab's API's all the way.\r\n\r\nI've wrote several
    scripts for FL that handle MM kerning, and I can tell you things can be complicated.
    The kerning values reside in something that looks like a list, and are associated
    with the left glyph of the pair.\r\n\r\nImagine a 2-master font with only one
    kerning pair AV, with a kerning value of -50 for the first master, and -80 for
    the second. If you do,\r\n<code>print fl.font['A'].kerning[0].values</code>\r\nyou'll
    get <code>[-50,-80]</code>.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties start when you try to modify
    the values or add new pairs.\r\n\r\nThe list of kerning pairs is read-only, so
    this will fail,\r\n<code>fl.font['A'].kerning[0].values = [-10, -30]</code>\r\nbut
    you can change the values one by one, like so,\r\n<code>fl.font['A'].kerning[0].values[0]
    = -10\r\nfl.font['A'].kerning[0].values[1] = -30</code>\r\n\r\nAnd to copy the
    values of one pair to another pair, you first need to create that pair (if it
    doesn't exist already), \r\n<code>defaultKerningValue = -1\r\nrightGlyphID = fl.font.FindGlyph('T')\r\npair
    = KerningPair(rightGlyphID, defaultKerningValue)\r\nfl.font['A'].kerning.append(pair)</code>\r\nand
    then go through the values and modify them accordingly.\r\n\r\nAgain, handling
    MM kerning is not trivial. You might be better off saving AFM files, modifying
    them and reading back in. But that process is not 100% reliable sometimes, so
    proceed with care."

  body: Rachel, what your script is trying to to can be handled by <em>class kerning</em>
    much easier. No coding necessary.

  body: You may be better off writing a single script that has a global variable defining
    the master. So run it once with the value 0 for light master, and then 1 for the
    next and so on. I've several scripts that I use on fonts with 7+ masters and this
    works fine, but I also don't do kerning within FontLab so I'm not 100% sure this
    will work for what you are doing.
