  tried identifying this font through several tools online, with no success - and
  unfortunately the Photoshop file was made by a former employee and someone flattened
  it...\r\n\r\nCan anyone please shed some light??\r\n\r\nThanks in advance[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WFI_3879.jpg]"

    if Bebas Neue looks just like another font then that must be the solution\r\nto
    our font identification - so what is it?\r\n\r\nsee here for better view of Bebas:\r\nwww.dharmatype.com/dharma-type"

  body: "Actually the curves overall in Bebas are pretty good - when opened in FontLab
    only thing Font Audit found was this on that curve on the 2. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontaudit2_4361.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the interest of fairness not all free fonts are bad - on the other hand some are
    really bad. Dafont and other free font sites have examples of both - you need
    to be careful and try things out just like with some commercial fonts."

  body: "That one bad curve makes the font essentially unusable (\"2\" is not exactly
    a rare character). And Bebas might have other problems (like in its kerning) that
    don't show up as quickly, but could end up ruining a project after it's too late
    to change the font. Then you need a font editor (and the expertise to use it)
    or you need to pay somebody to fix it. So in the end, not at all free.\r\n\r\nOf
    course not all free fonts are bad. But pretending commercial fonts have a comparable
    degree of problems is not realistic. You need to be able to trust your tools.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'One bad curve does not make any font unusable. Run a FontAudit on many commercial
    fonts and it makes suggestions on some curves, not all that are very critical
    or even really worthy of being marked. That being said, I really do not think
    anyone would say that commercial fonts have as many problems as free fonts. A
    commercial foundry would not stay in business very long if they became known for
    problem fonts. It is said on Typophile often enough that you are safer with professional
    commercial fonts. '

    not sure I'm quite there yet, it seems like its a bit too Bold and not Condensed
    enough... Is it because I didn't download the right one??\r\n\r\nOther than that
    it's perfect! :) \r\nThanks "

  body: "The \"2\" in Bebas is defective, and will sometimes come out distorted. Considering
    the designer doesn't seem to mind, there might be (and probably are) other serious
    technical issues. Unless you have the software and the skills to fix such problems
    on-the-spot, you might realize too late that you have to switch fonts. The \"perfect\"
    might become \"putrid\", and publicizing that turn-around would be a useful public
    service.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The issue of not being condensed enough can be corrected by adjusting the
    tracking, like for the phone number, also notice that different tracking was used
    for the e-mail line as well. And as I said earlier I have played with the font
    and found no major problems with it.

    file <code>texmf/tex/makor2/refcard.pdf</code> of the makor2 TeX package (dated
    2003) that I still have in my things.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ezradist_5387.png]\r\nThe
    cause of the distortion was not, so far as I understand, \"crappy curves\". The
    elements in <code>BlueValues</code> were <code>-320 5 -76 707</code>, which just
    makes no sense. After changing <code>BlueValues</code>, the font was working without
    problem.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Fontforge complains about the elements in BlueValues/OtherBlues
    of Bebas neue. Maybe the distortion on dafont also comes from there."
