body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI just wrote my first Open Type feature, but it doesn't work! I
  was trying to acheive a simple glyph substitution:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub
  A E by AE;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nAs I hit the \xBBCompile\xAB Button, the following
  Message appeared:\r\n\r\n[FATAL] <FontName> aborting because of errors:\r\nsyntax
  error at \"feature\"\r\n[/Users/jurgen/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
  5/Features/fontlab.fea 6]\r\n\r\nWhy? What can I do?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJuergen"

    the OT code in Free Font Pro, if not, your Fontlab install might be corrupt.\r\n\r\nAnd
    just in case you aren\u2019t just using it as a test, AE is a letter, not a ligature,
    and shouldn\u2019t have ligature code."

    yesterday and it doesn't worked.\r\n\r\n Thanks for your help, anyway!\r\n\r\n(YEEESSS,
    I know AE is not a ligature : ) It was just a quick test with the few glyphs I
    have so far)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJuergen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
