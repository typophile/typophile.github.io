  body: Perhaps not a luxury, but stepping away from the computer is always a good
    idea. I also find doing non-design activities helps, things like playing with
    my niece.  <BR> <BR>Speak-Up discussed <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001718.html#001718"

  body: '1. I take the project to a friend and talk through where I&#39;m at. Often
    having to articulate the problem jars loose a solid or obvious idea I was having
    a hard time seeing. Or, their perspective gives me a fresh idea or perspective
    of my own. I find that sometimes this works best when the other person isn&#39;t
    a designer. <BR> <BR>2. Caffeine. <BR> <BR>3. Change the music I&#39;m listening
    to. <BR> <BR>4. Go and read about a successful design project in a book/mag/website.
    Sometimes I&#39;m not suffering from creative block, but creative fatigue and
    it helps to see a successful process and get excited and on track again. <BR>
    <BR>5. Stop. Look at what I&#39;m doing. Do it <i>completely</i> differently.
    This includes things like what I&#39;m looking at, computer vs. hand drawing,
    type vs. image, the application I&#39;m in, being specific vs. being general,
    medium vs. message. <BR> <BR>Hope that helps. I just used #1 this weekend to much
    success.'

  body: a&#41; try to define the design problem that you have to solve and your personal
    approach to it b&#41; take a hot bath or a cold shower &#40;depending on what
    kind of person you are&#41; c&#41; walk at least for 45 minutes &#40;best without
    seeing any person&#41; d&#41; start with something &#40;you know the final result
    will look totally different anyway&#41;
