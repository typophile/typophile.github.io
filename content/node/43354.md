body: "I'm working on a logo, and I'd like to give it a chiseled or faceted look.
  The letter base is Zine Slab. I have Cabarge's book (Logo,Font & Lettering Bible)
  and he suggests staring with a skeleton stroke then building from there using diamonds
  to create a faceted face.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there are other styles or ways
  to do this? Since Zine has these nice thick slab serifs, the technique Cabarge gives
  doesn't really work, not to mention I don't have a skeleton stroke of the letter.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the base:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FAST_3612.gif]"

  body: I could do it manually fairly easily, but I'm having a tough time coming up
    with step-by-step instructions. I thought there was a filter that does this automatically.
    Isn't there one?

    logo?\r\nCorelDraw has a feature to automatically add a chiseled look (Effects>Bevel
    as shown at top of image), or if you want to draw the facets manually, you can
    convert your logo to a bitmap temporarily and use Corel's Centerline Trace feature
    to get the skeleton stroke as shown in bottom of image. [note the roughness of
    curves is only because I did this quickly, you could be as accurate as you'd like.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Graphic1_5722.jpg]"

  body: "the bottom A-S join seems to be missing a highlighted size (left side of
    the serif on the S like the top one).\r\n\r\nAlso, if your light source is upper-left,
    you'd want to reverse the shadow/dark side on the mid-part of the S.\r\n\r\nBut
    those are both 'technical' answer and, aesthetically, it seems to work just fine
    as-is."

  body: "Yeah, originally the S was actually really easy. I thought it was almost
    too easy, so I started playing around with the middle curve and where there might
    be shadows and such... that became more of a headache than I cared to deal with.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that there is a better solution, but for this being my first attempt, I'm
    very satisfied.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help folks."
