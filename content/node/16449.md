body: "Hello everybody\r\nJust arriving in this typaradise! I'm a graphic designer
  in Paris (with a friend, under the name of \"deValence\") and we sometimes draw
  typefaces. Some are really ours (wich means it is part of our own graphic vocabulary)
  but some might be sold and used by other people... i just wonder if you guys could
  check our designs and tell us what you think of our fonts... The newest one has
  been drawn for the Dada big exhibition in Paris. well, if anyone wants to check
  at http://www.devalence.net ... welcome there!\r\n "
