body: Im looking to sharpen my pre-press skills. CYMK color management, and prepress
  teniques and tricks. <BR> <BR>Anyone have any good books, or online articles? <BR>
  <BR>I am fairly advanced in this area, so Im looking for more advanced things. For
  instance using GCR vs. UCR, and how papers  effect differently to each. Things of
  this nature. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    great informative books from most of the paper merchants we use. And they were
    free!

  body: Adobe Studio has some useful information, you only need dig around. <a href="http://studio.adobe.com/"
    target="_blank">http://studio.adobe.com/</a> -- Searching on their site for phrases
    that you need to understand is useful. They often have links to other sites or
    posting in the forums can help too.
