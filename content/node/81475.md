body: "Hi.  My name is Drew and I am doing a branding and development project for
  a local Mortgage company.  The company name is First Home Equity Loans.  He asked
  for a new logo to be \"upstanding, professional, and to look bigger than the company
  really is\".  He is a former Marine and carries himself and his business in a very
  upstanding and patriotic demeanor.  I developed two different ideas for the logo
  and he chose from the two.  I would like some feedback on both of them as the one
  he chose will need to be more fully developed and the one he did not choose I would
  like to possibly use in the future.  The customer was happy with the file called
  \"fhe logo approved.pdf\" and I would like to finalize that one.  The other file
  \"fhe house tab sample.pdf\" is the file I would like to possibly re-use in the
  future.  Again I would appreciate any feedback or critique.  I will try to be responsive
  with any requests. Please keep in mind this is one of my first projects and I would
  like to make this a portfolio piece.  Thanks.  \r\n\r\nOh and by the way I would
  like some feedback on the perception of the geometric icon in the approved logo.
  \ Is it recognizable? does it read as houses connected or not?"

  body: "approved version - i would suggest removing the color in the \"door\" of
    each house. i like 3d feel the roofs give off. i can see this working in bw very
    nicely. type selection, i would revisit this. also, the mark and words feel unbalanced
    to me. \r\n\r\nsample - seems really busy. i'd suggest you start in black white
    first then move to color. \r\n"

  body: Approved version is the one to refine yes. And please don't use Trajan for
    it because it doesn't work well with this kind of a logo.

  body: "Thanks for your comments. My apologies for taking so long to respond.  Here
    is what I have come up with after taking your comments into consideration.  I
    still feel the typeface choice may need to be addressed further.  The customer
    likes the readability of this new typeface but misses the \"flair\" of the first
    option.  Suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FHE-logo-draft-2_6617.jpg]"

  body: One major issue here is hirearchy.  All the text is the same size and weight.  You
    have the opportunity to emphasize certain words to guide the eye toward more important
    parts first.  Then consider a left alignment, the center align is not doing any
    favors to your composition.  Hope that helps!

  body: "The mark is very nice, but the type needs work.  Why not use a left alignment
    and put it all on one line, or space it like:\r\n\r\nFirst Home\r\nEquity Loans\r\n\r\nAlso,
    take another look at the kerning. Look at the space between the letters in \"Ho\"
    and \"me,\" and \"Eq\" and \"uity.\""

    based on your advice[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fhe-logo-two-rows_3501.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fhe-three-rows_6460.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FHEL-caps_6344.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fhelangledoors_5158.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview-FHEL_5315.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fhe_caps_angle_3486.jpg]

  body: Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that "home equity loans" is one idea
    or term.  If so, it would make the most sense to have FIRST be larger on the top
    line, and the rest smaller on the bottom line.  The way you are breaking the text
    now, it reads as FIRST HOME, which might be only for people buying their first
    home or something - and EQUITY LOANS which I am not sure is the proper term in
    the business.  Hope that helps.

  body: lol yeah thats the huge issue i am having, you are correct.  actually home
    equity needs to be together if anything, that's why i had it broken down into
    three lines.  visually, three lines might be too much.  I like your idea about
    first being solo and the rest being all together.  I will work on that today

    a nested block.\r\n\r\notherwise it's a great logo mark, i think i prefer the
    one without doors. \r\nlook forward to seeing the progression!"

  body: "If you ask me I kinda like the three lined version best. As you say words
    are correctly coupled in it as well.\r\n\r\nThe last logo version would make sense
    if the company would be called /FIRST/.\r\n/Home equity loans/ are secondary and
    only indicate what company's business is about."

  body: definitely like the latest version on the mark. increased the roofs size,
    right? makes that center more prominent and attractive. agree with @litera business
    name.

  body: ">Litera, I was leaning toward the three lined version as well. But it does
    make sense to pronounce it as \"First\" home equity loans, with the emphasis on
    First. Home equity loans would be secondary as the client explained it; kinda
    like \"First Bank\".  This may be a case of compromise between design and functionality.\r\n\r\n>hola,
    Yeah I did increase the size of the roofs. Thanks, I agree about that working
    well."
