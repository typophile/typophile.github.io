  body: I can't help but feel that this face would be better off without the sheared
    ascenders. But that may be a matter of taste. The only thing that really looks
    malformed to me is C/c (the bottom half specifically). And even though your ductus
    is mostly horizontal, you probably won't escape the common reaction that the A
    is backwards.

    las esquinas en las mayusculas probablemente son innecesarias. Ojo con las proporciones
    de C, E, F y J.\r\n\r\nYa casi! Felicitaciones!\r\n\r\nC\xE9sar Puertas\r\nwww.cesarpuertas.com\r\ncepuertas@hotmail.com"
