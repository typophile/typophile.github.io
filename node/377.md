    this is most likely illegal as the book is still under copyright. In a thread
    over at Typographica Stephen Moye posted something to the effect that he has discovered
    that the copyright has reverted back to him from the original publisher and he
    may be intending to re-issue it in revised form&#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: No, somebody else said that the publisher told him that the rights had reverted
    to Moye, but that was news to Moye himself! Then Moye said he&#39;d figure this
    out. <BR> <BR>Yeah, it&#39;s illegal. So was the French Revolution. <BR> <BR>hhp

    else to follow through. Damn. <BR> <BR>Below are the two posts to the thread from
    S. Moye. This sound like &#34;I&#39;ll have to figure this out&#34; to you? <BR>
    <BR>Gerald <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Stuart - I would really appreciate a copy, in one
    form or another, of the letter you received from Wiley. Before I start revising
    the book I want to make quite sure of my ground. <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Stephen

    <BR> <BR>Sorry to be tiresome, but I wanted to thank you for the kind words. Just
    the encouragement I need to start on the second edition and corrections to the
    first.'

  body: What&#39;s all the fuss about boys? If you&#39;re looking for the FOG book
    you can buy a copy at the Typecon Auction in July, on eBay, or wait a several
    months for Mr. Moye to bring the followup book to market. <BR> <BR>FYI, the reason
    I found out about the rights reverting to Mr. Moye is primarily due to the fact
    that I wanted to see this book re-published because it is as relevant a resource
    today as it was when it was published in 1997. <BR> <BR>Now he&#39;s got some
    inertia to rewrite it and I expect it&#39;ll be glorius :D <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    will be releasing a new version of it in the coming year sometime . . . <BR> <BR>Hrant,  he
    previously had inertia and now he has momentum. . . The brain spins slower at
