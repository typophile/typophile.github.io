  body: I really like it too but I see some issues I would fix if it were mine. Although
    maybe it was just set too tight...

  body: To be precise, this is Marian 1554, not 1570. Eben, I'm curious to hear what
    issues you might fix, besides the obvious problems with the spacing. This layout
    appears to use some sort of automatic kerning - this spacing doesn't really reflect
    what I see in the actual font at all.

  body: "Hmm I probably spoke  a bit over casually casually. Like that's never happened
    before. ;-) But I'll take the bait in hopes of learning more...\r\n\r\nAssuming
    for the sake of argument that the spacing stayed the same - already something
    we know it should not - I would make the Cap T more narrow. I would drop the leg
    on the R to let the R get closer. The N & L might be more narrow. If the s is
    going to be so close it should tuck under the y. The various serif like ends like
    on the n - I would cut them back slightly. \r\n\r\nBut obviously I say all this
    quite advisedly because really I haven't seen the font as intended. For one thing
    there is very little of the lower case to go by. Does anybody know where I can
    see more? I have googled it & no dice. Christian, is there a PDF we could look
    at? \r\n\r\nAnd what do you think?\r\n"
