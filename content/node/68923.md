  a postcard being sent out as an invitation to my portfolio show, and I am hoping
  to develop 2 or 3 full size posters further developing the idea of creativity as
  a currency. Any and all comments welcome!\r\n\r\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/9742/creativecurrency.png"

    somewhat heavy."

  body: The grey border is the background/artboard, not part of the design. What can
    you recommend for the type?

  body: Maybe you could try a subtle gradient.

  body: "I like the idea and the background pattern, also the gradient.\r\nMaybe the
    grey border is distracting, if it\u2019s not part of the design try a white one,
    the colours may seem  less intense.\r\nI agree with riccard0 about the main type.
    It\u2019s too heavy and/or the contrast is too harsh.\r\n\r\nIn print, silver
    would look great, at least for \u2018creativity\u2019 and \u2018currency\u2019.
    Or even a hologram/kinegram ;)\r\nBut maybe lightening up your charcoal and a
    lighter weight would do.\r\n\r\nFor further (banknote) inspiration see also http://www.bank-note.ru/security.html"
