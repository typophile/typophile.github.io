    try one using the outline face in the place of the current AKA"

  body: "Have you tried using two lines of text instead of the one you have here.
    I tend to dislike really long logos simply from a usability stand.\r\n\r\nI also
    think the character spacing is a bit too large.\r\n\r\nI would probably increase
    the weight as well from a legibility and reproduction stand. \r\nDo you have a
    thicker weight of DIN maybe?\r\n\r\nI'm with Darrel when he says that the dots
    are a bit strange. Maybe try the whole AKA in Orange (Orange works great with
    grey).\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"

  body: "i was curious as to why the second 'A' is of a different color... is it to
    call attention to the first two initials (like Alto Kick Architecture)?\r\nand
    i have to agree that the dots don't feel architectural enough to me. i think it
    might work w/o the dots completely.\r\n\r\nwith the outlined letters in he second
    version, did you try losing all the vertical strokes at the top and bottom of
    the AKA?"

    I'm not satisfied with this logo because its look familiar to me! I know when
    I browse internet.There is variations of the same for different applications.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_resize_4014.jpg]\r\nThank
    you so much for all your feedback."

  body: "Ooops;-)\r\n\r\nConsider the size of the architecture construction.\r\nIt
    is way to small in comparison to the other elements (the AKA)\r\nThis logo will
    have to be reproduced always at a fairly large size to compensate for this issue.\r\n\r\nOut
    of the versions I found it interesting with the orrange version.\r\nTry the dots
    in the same colour as the A it belongs to if you are determined to keep them,
    that will solve the problem of the beforementioned owl eyes.\r\n\r\nDon't think
    the bottom right one work; the letters become cryptic and illegible.\r\n"

  body: "'Also Known As' Architecture \u2013 Construction :P\r\n\r\nI agree with Endre,
    you need to shrink the 'AKA' to at least 50% the size that it is in those latest
    variations. I also like the orange one best, but coloring the dots differently
    just adds to the 'noise' of the composition."

  body: as mentioned before, the dots are a bit distracting. I like your first idea
    better(AKA | arch....). It has a nice clean professional feel. These current ones
    feel a bit forced. Plus sizing might become an issue. I would suggest going with
    your original idea and work on the dot issue. Maybe it's not a dot that you use,
    but a small vertical line coming from inside the right leg of the 'A'. All i see
    now is angry A's. I might tighten up kerning as well and stack the 'Architecture/Construction"
    if you feel it gets to long.

    so we can actually see anything.
