body: "I was watching Chef Gordon Ramsey's \"Kitchen Nightmares\" recently, and saw
  this great font for the restaurant, \"Bonaparte's.\"  I love it... I think it will
  go great with an illustration I have for a logo.\r\n\r\n(JH POSTED A SCREEN SHOT
  OF IT IN THE POST BELOW.)\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, the only sample I have to show is from
  the show's youtube video.  If you look at it and PAUSE at 1:16 (one minute, sixteen
  seconds) in to the video, you will see the sign I am talking about.  It's here:
  \ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-R7_odvij4\r\n\r\n(Again, I'm so sorry I don't
  have an easier way to see it.)\r\n\r\nPlease... if you can help at all, I would
  greatly appreciate it.  Also, if you have expertise in matching a font type with
  an illustration (caricature-looking) to create a logo, please let me know.  I may
  be looking for someone to handle this small project.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nnader-notralph"
