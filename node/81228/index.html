  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, there.

This might be a really stupid question, but I am anxious to find an answer, and this is the only reason I have subscribed to this list.  So please give me a break and put me out of my misery by shedding light on my ignorance.

I am currently doing an on-line job that involves grading standardized writing tests for seventh graders.  Something peculiar I have noticed in their handwritten answers is the odd writing of an "s".  Instead of the top and the bottom of the "s" being at 12 and 6 o'clock, these "s"'s have been written so that the top and bottom are more at like 2 and 8 o'clock.  And they are always very fat and very curvy.

I am culturally deprived, as I do not watch tv, nor do I follow much but music and politics.  I am also a tad older (48), and therefore am sure I am not running into the same things that a seventh grader would.

So, can someone help me out here?  I've tried googling "s" logo images, and I even thought maybe Justin Bieber wrote his name this way (I do, after all, get some popular culture exposure when I log on to my e-mail account, so I know he is all the rave with this crowd).  But no go.

Any kind soul prepared to help me out with this one?  I thought it seemed like a good place to ask the question.  And I am a curious sort, at that.</div>

Does this resemble the sort of writing you're seeing?

I think they mean that the loops of s are in these clock positions rather than being two separate clock faces. So rather than being upright, they are slanted.

Is S the only slanted letter and all the others are upright?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi.  Thanks for all the responses.  But, nope, I am reading essays from kids throughout the state of Texas, and they are all doing the same thing.  I am thinking a rap artist.  What they are doing is similar to the figure in the box (6.2) that is furthest left, and one from the bottom.  But this S/s has no line through it, and it is written 180 degrees differently from the one shown.  Therefore, the beginning of the stroke made to make the S/s actually starts at like three or four o'clock, and the fat part (or the 'top') of the S/s is at like two o'clock.  Enough kids have done this, and it is geographically distributed at least throughout the state of Texas, such that I am sure that it comes from somewhere within the mass media, again something to which I am not particularly well-exposed.

And, yes, the S/s is the only slanted letter, so it kind of makes the essay difficult to read.  Kind of stands out as an idiosyncratic way of writing, but when you start to see enough of them, you realize they are emulating someone or something else.

I am losing sleep because of this (just kidding), so anyone with the right answer gets a five-dollar Starbuck's card if s/he tells me where to send it (for realsies).  (Who's the OP???  Omnipresent Pen?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just about the only thing I can think of in hip-hop typography you could do with an S is change it to a z or a $, but that's not really a southern thing, more LA and NY respectively. The late DJ Screw would (I guess still) be an "S" with an obvious rationale to lean ("lean" being a particular dance associated with "sipping" codeine-laced cough syrup "drank", a practice I understand is now having a resurgence particularly in its native Houston area), but I've never heard of or seen it in any official context associated with him.</div>

I agree with Joshua. Affectations in handwriting are more likely to be influenced by who you sit next to in class than the signature of a celebrity. I'd still like to see an example of what you are describing.</div>

I don't know where it started, but it certainly is irritating, more so than hearts on the i's.  FWIW, it doesn't tend to be my better students, but as a test examiner that's probably not something that you should think about.</div>
