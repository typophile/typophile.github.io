  the serifs are slabbed instead of pointed and the S and o's seem to be bit stretched.\r\n\r\nTried
  whatthefont and identifont but I think there wasn't enough number of different letter
  to get a close match.\r\n\r\nThanks in advaned."

  body: "Darn.  That's a shame.  This client wants me to develop a website for them
    and they have told me they already have a company logo, only to find out they
    didn't have one in soft copy. Apparently, they scanned the logo on a letterhead
    and sent it to me. >:(\r\n\r\nI was hoping to replicate it on my own but I guess
    it may prove difficult task... hmm..."

  body: It's pretty simple, if it comes down to it you could just get a high res scan
    and re-digitize it yourself.
