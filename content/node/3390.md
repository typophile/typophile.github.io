  body: 'Miguel, I think the idea of &#34;stealing&#34; and <BR>plagiarism in low-res
    bitmap fonts is elusive to <BR>say the least. There&#39;s only so much one can
    do <BR>with that few pixels. In the case in point, the <BR>idea is not terribly
    original anyway, and as one <BR>reduces the design grid, solutions naturally <BR>tend
    to converge. Of course, there&#39;s always <BR>scope for some personality: for
    instance, your <BR>Three-Dots &#39;E&#39; is rather original &#40;and not very
    <BR>legible ;&#41;, but it&#39;s in any case slightly similar <BR>to the one in

    &#40;of course, the art-d&eacute;co guys had done this <BR>sort of &#39;E&#39;
    70 years before Gustavo or you ;&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d think very hard before
    deciding that a low-res <BR>bitmap font was &#34;stolen&#34;. Having said that,
    I <BR>should add that I didn&#39;t bother to enlarge the <BR>image of Absolute
    Minimal to check if there&#39;s <BR>any unexpected similarity to your design.

  body: I&#39;d never seen any absolute minimal bitmap font before.  I&#39;m sure
    I&#39;m not the first to do one, and yeah, there&#39;s not that many ways to do
    a 3x3 font &#40;I mean, there&#39;s only 512 unique 3x3 bitmaps altogether, most
    of which do not actually represent a letter. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>I only discovered this site very recently &#40;yesterday,
    in fact&#41; and in a cursory examination of the forums, I didn&#39;t find another
    minimal font.  Also, I&#39;d like to point out that I did the tiny font <A HREF="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/3/12/20853/2238">way
    back in March</A>.  You might want to consider that before accusing me of plagiarism.

    it to friends, a couple of them said, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve done something like

    though I know that name&#39;s already taken&#41; actually looks pretty good.  I
