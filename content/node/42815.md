    think she might possibly be mixing up one Celtic language with another (well,
    two others): in both Irish and Scottish, when initial consonants are eclipsed,
    only the original consonant is capitalised, not the eclipsing consonant.\r\n\r\nSo,
    for example, <em>br\xF3g</em> \u2018shoe\u2019, <em>dl\xED</em> \u2018law\u2019,
    <em>gr\xE1</em> \u2018love\u2019, <em>poll</em> \u2018hole\u2019, <em>teach</em>
    \u2018house\u2019, and <em>cill</em> \u2018church\u2019, if eclipsed and capitalised,
    would be written thus:\r\n\r\n<em>a mBr\xF3ga</em> \u2018their shoes\u2019\r\n<em>a
    nDl\xEDthe</em> \u2018their laws\u2019\r\n<em>i nGr\xE1</em> \u2018in love\u2019\r\n<em>i
    bPoll</em> \u2018in a hole\u2019\r\n<em>i dTigh</em> \u2018in(side) a house\u2019\r\n<em>i
    gCill</em> \u2018in a church\u2019\r\n\r\nEven if written in all-caps, it should
    still be <em>A mBR\xD3GA</em>, <em>A nDL\xCDTHE</em>, &c.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t
    think of any instance in Welsh where a similar situation would arise, either.
    Eclipses (or soft lenitions, or whatever you call them in Welsh\u2014Welsh initial
    mutations confuse me a bit) are, to my knowledge, capitalised normally in Welsh,
    on the rare occasion that they result in multiple letters. I have a song called
    <em>Yng Ngolau Ddydd</em>, for instance; not <em>Yng nGolau Ddydd</em>."

    old orthography only allowed triple consonants when they are followed by another
    consonant (\u2018Sauerstoffflasche\u2019), now all the <em>Duden</em> has to say
    about this is to advise to separate compound words with a hyphen, in order to
    improve legibility (\u2018Sauerstoff-Flasche\u2019). Triple vocals (\u2018Teeei\u2019)
    always have been compulsive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a lot of new triples were introduced
    by replacing \u2018\xDF\u2019 with \u2018ss\u2019 in some words (Pa\xDFstra\xDFe
    > Passstra\xDFe, also all the other triple-s words that Tim has mentioned. It\u2019s

    I understand it, German typographic convention is not to form ligatures across

    an ff ligature followed by an fl ligature.\r\n\r\nI am currently collecting words
    containing four or more ascender letters in a row (full ascenders, so t is not
    counted). Can anyone here think of any, other than the German fffl examples already
    given and the silly Welsh llll sequence?"

  body: Actually, the form of the fffl ligature in Requiem is very good and arguably,
    by differentiating the descender of the third f, provides a nice alternative to
    breaking ligature formation across a word-boundary.
