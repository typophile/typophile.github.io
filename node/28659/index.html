<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm working on a few very rough comps for a Book Design class I'm taking. Right now we're working on Book Jacket design and I've run into a wall. If you look at the image, you'll see that I need to make the type distort so it looks like it's actually running on the 'tape' My thought was to use Envelope Distort but that just sends the type to funky town and it's totally unreadable. Right now it's just running Type On A Path with the same path I've used to create the tape. Any suggestions would be awesome!

<div class=commentbody>My personal opinion is to redo your concept so that you don't have to distort the type at all. That's a typography no no in my books. Also, right now it's reading "The Vespers A Novel Tapes"
Conceptually this seams like the simplest solution to your book cover problem. Think this way: what other types of tape are there and how can they be used? Video tape, scotch tape, duct tape...etc etc....I'm guessing this is video tape you're trying to convey? Maybe showing video tape is too obvious then. Also think about mood. What type of book is this? Comedy? Mystery? Horror? I have no clue from this design.
About book covers...whatever your design, think about how the viewer is going to see it and how many different situations. The rule of thumb I use is to think how it will still look when reduced to an itty bitty postage stamp size, like when sold in catalogs as well as on book shelves. All that text you are trying to wrap isn't going to read at a small catalog size.
I have some great ideas but I think you should work it out on your own. Good luck!
Anyone else agree?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I said it's a rough concept because if I can get the type to do what I want then I'll be able to execute my idea. Also, the project is front, spine and back cover, my idea spans all three to create one idea. Basically I'm just looking for possible solutions, if I end up using this concept I'll post the whole idea in a comprehensive layout.
It's a book about a mafia boss who is dying and hires a teacher to record his lifestory on tape and how the rest of the mafia responds and how it puts the teacher in danger.
Thanks for your critique, but it's not really what I was looking for.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The best way to do it is photographically, create a flat mock-up, position it and shoot it with a copy camera setup, and then do a bit of Photoshop to clean it up, you <em>could</em> illustrate it but the effect involves a lot of work to achieve a believable effect.
