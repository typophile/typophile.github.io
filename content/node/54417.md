body: I lack the necessary knowledge on the subject, so I thought I'd ask. I'm looking
  at buying Bryant Condensed from Process and an employee of the foundry explained
  that I can use sIFR on a website if the files are secure (she did mention this was
  the short answer!). I don't want to be in violation of the EULA. How do I make sure
  the files cannot be downloaded?

  body: The actual font file is not downloaded or available if that's what you're
    asking. You can decompile SWFs but I don't think the font information (beyond
    the shape of the letters) is available even after such a decompilition.

  body: I don't think they know how sIFR works. It'd be akin to a PDF. There's enough
    information to render the shapes of the type within the file, but the actual font
    is not included.

    Dolly), and ended up doing server/PHP image generation instead since I wasn't
    sure how to "protect" sIFR.

  body: "With the introduction of OpenType support in the most recent Flash update
    I think the complete font can be included in the SWF. \r\n\r\nI would be concerned
    signing anything saying any converted, embedded or encapsulated font is ever \"secure\".\r\n\r\n"

  body: sIFR is about as protective as using straight-up images - someone could theoretically
    trace your letter shapes from any posted image. With a SWF the only difference
    is that the vectors could potentially be decompiled from the SWF (or like someone
    running autotrace on your lettershapes). But no metrics would be available. And
    you can subset the amount of glyphs that are embedded within the SWF, thus reducing
    even more what could potentially be pulled out of the SWF. At any rate, anyone
    going through that much effort to "pull" a font from a SWF values their time much
    more differently then I would.

  body: "sIFR has documentation for taking a few small steps to protect the fonts
    that you've embedded in the .swf files that it uses:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/Protecting+Commercial+Fonts\r\n\r\n...the
    idea being to allow only your website to access the .swf file that contains the
    font so that other sites can't just point themselves to the file and use it too.
    These are very likely the security precautions that those foundries may have been
    talking about (but double check with them to be sure).\r\n\r\nAndy"

  body: Not sure. Talking about your reference to PDFs, aren't at least a part of
    the "cracked" fonts floating around extracted from PDFs? I'm not sure I wouldn't
    share that measure of "paranoia" if I was publishing a font.

    you develop a sense of paranoia. For smaller foundries it's kind of like the guy
    running the small corner shop, who has a \"no more than two school children at
    a time\" sign. The larger vendors write off the thievery as part of the cost of
    doing business, which equals less paranoia. \r\n\r\n "

  body: "Thank you all for your responses.\r\nI guess I have to ask for the long answer
    concerning embedding with sIFR. I must say my position as consumer is rather frustrating.
    While their EULA did not seem overly limiting, it looks like it isn't clear enough
    either. With the current limitations of web typography, methods like sIFR (or
    @font-face) are a breath of fresh air. But are they secure? Here's the paragraph
    from the EULA that regulates embedding ([[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/help/ptflicense.html|Link]]).\r\n\r\n>Embedding
    of the Fonts into web pages or digital documents is permitted only in a secured,
    read-only mode. You must ensure that recipients of such web pages or documents
    cannot extract, install or use the embedded Fonts. The creation of new documents
    using an embedded copy of the Font Software is expressly prohibited. You further
    agree not to change or alter the embedding bits or other restrictions of the embedding
    programs within the Font Software itself."

  body: "I think I can clear this up.\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks Dan for taking the time
    to understand our EULA and investigate whether it meets your needs before you
    purchase. That's really a best-case scenario.\r\n\r\nIf you are to follow the
    advice that Andy linked to about protecting the files/font, then you should be
    within the bounds of our EULA and we would have no issue with that usage.\r\n\r\nTowards
    the notion of security. 'Secure' is difficult to define. There are few methods
    of font usage that are 100% secure, so we cannot expect a customer to keep our
    fonts 100% secure. Even in the print world, simply giving the file to a service
    bureau (which is allowed in our EULA) is not necessarily secure. But, we've tried
    to strike a balance between protecting our work from unreasonable, unlicensed
    distribution and giving customers usage rights that do not unduly burden their
    use of the fonts.\r\n\r\nSo, we don't expect a customer to 'guarantee' the security
    of the fonts, which is simply not possible, but we do expect that they take reasonable
    measures to protect the fonts when they use them in ways that potentially put
    them at risk of unlicensed distribution.\r\n\r\nNicole, Process Type Foundry"

    I understand where you're coming from. In a world where everyone respects EULAs,
    'best efforts' makes sense, but we know that's not the world we live in. There
    is still so much room for interpretation in the phrase. My 'best effort' as a
    cyclist, for example, is not even in the same universe as Lance Armstrong's.  \r\n\r\nThe
    EULA is written for the person who makes every effort to abide by its terms and
    those who willfully disregard it. It is not always an easy balance. We'll keep
    thinking about it though, especially since these issues are becoming more and
    more pressing by the day."
