  body: "I\u2019m not sure about a book about the visual characteristics, but I've
    been reading a book called [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Type-History-Letters-Simon-Loxley/dp/1845110285/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234974304&sr=1-12|Type]]
    . It gives a really good foundation of the history of typography. I found the
    information helpful and interesting and it dose mention some notable characteristics
    of certain fonts, but mainly focuses on the designers and their lives. I'll be
    watching this thread, because I\u2019ve been looking for a good book on the subject.
    Good Luck\r\n\r\nStef\r\n"

    and the way it communicates with the reader\" is a bit broad. If you can narrow
    it down a bit, perhaps we might be able to suggest more books that would be worthwhile.
    Otherwise, just about any book on typography covers the visual characteristics
    and how it communicates with the reader."

  body: "Thank you!\r\nWell, my big questions about that theme are:\r\nDo you think
    typography can communicate the way we speak? \r\nHow many emotions can be communicated
    through typography?\r\nWhy has someone used that typeface instead of some other
    (in advertising, in packaging..)?\r\nDo you think a typeface can illicit zero
    emotional reaction in the viewer?\r\n\r\nI already read The Elements of Typographic
    Style by Robert Bringhurst, Thinking with type by Elen Lupton, TypoGraphic by
    Ivan Vartanian, Logo Font&Lettering Bible by Leslie Cabarga, and The Vignelli
    Canon by Massimo Vignelli. \r\nI read this books becouse they were the only one
    I could find. I think about ordering from amazon but i have modest budget :(\r\n\r\n"

    <em>The New Typography</em>, and old issues of <em>Emigre</em>.

    start 5 Worksheets each one dedicated to a different idea and see where it takes
    you...\r\n\r\nthen perhaps map what you have done and see if anyone was thinking
    the same thing.\r\nDon't think you have to look at books first - this might actually
    start to limit your thinking.\r\n\r\n-or perhaps seeing other work then will set
    up a new set of questions...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMichael
