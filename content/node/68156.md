  whose first language most likely isn't English. This made me laugh.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sig-nails_4728.JPG]\r\nFunny
  how the first 4 letters in NAILS (left sign) are razor-sharp, but the writer went
  free-form with the S after presumably giving up on a ruler-based letter. \r\n\r\nThe
  rest of the text is wildly mixed cases, sizes and spacing. \r\n\r\nThen the artist
  added hand-drawn palm trees, flower and butterfly to complete its beauty and fill
  in the disturbing white spaces. Maybe his wife told him it wasn't pretty enough
  to appeal to women customers. \r\n\r\nObviously the sign on the right was composed
  by a different designer, who used an actual font (of questionable suitability),
  margins, a border and illustration, again with an eccentric result. \r\n\r\nthe
  two signs together - well how could any passer-by in need of nail attention resist?"

    such exquisitely manicured nails.

  body: "It's evident that suppliers to nail shops, dry-cleaners and barbershops sell
    off-the-shelf signs and window graphics kits. Which haven't been up-dated since
    1972.\r\nThat would explain why I've seen that blue and pink sign so many times
    before.\r\n\r\nThe decoration on the hand-made sign is kind of out of the \"white
    space must die\" school of art. \r\n\r\nThere's a shop near where my office used
    to be called, \"Good Hair Day Salon\". I'll always got a kick out of the name.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I wonder why the hand-lettered text has orangey background blocks filled
    in behind each word, since that makes it harder to read, if anything. Where would
    the artist have even seen such a typographical oddity? \r\n\r\nI guess I shouldn't
    waste any more time trying to make sense of it."
