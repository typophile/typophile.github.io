  body: "The quality of CafePress stuff is nothing to write home about, but they\u2019re
    fast and don\u2019t screw up much. When I last used it (In November) shirt designs
    still had to be uploaded as RGB raster files; you know what that does to the output.
    Also, the CafePress t-shirts are apparently sized for a universe in which all
    Americans are direct descendants of Divine; my medium fitted shirts could easily
    be used as nightgowns by most adult Americans."

    and James: while the quality of the shirt wasn''t great, the delivery was prompt
    and hassle-free.'

  body: Yes. It stands to reason that it wouldn't be high craft. Thanks for your info
    Richard & James!

  body: Typophile uses BigCartel, what about them? I worked for a client that sold
    tons of stuff through them.

- body: "CafePress isn't great quality, not terrible, but I've had serious issues
    with getting paid. They  screwed up my profits by posting negative numbers instead
    of positive. When I called (repeatedly) to straighten it out, they were VERY unhelpful.
    \r\n\r\nI've spoken to at least five people at CafePress, including three managers,
    and they all *see* the problem, but nobody can fix it. Two managers told me they'd
    fix it and call me back, and neither did. I finally just gave up. I roll my eyes
    every month when they email me telling me I've earned \"negative dollars\" this
    pay period, even though I've taken all my designs down. \r\n\r\nI don't recommend
    them, obviously. "

    stuff was made by them? Nice suggestion!\r\n\r\nAlaskan, that is gruesome tale

  body: The Typophile tees were printed here in San Francisco at Ape Do Good Printing.
    I think Big Cartel is just an online sales facilitator.

  body: "I only worked on the CSS for my client's Big Cartel storefront. Now that
    you mention it, I guess the shirts etc., were done in-house. Seems like a nice
    service though.\r\n\r\nA website that I write/design for has some stuff for sale
    on a [[http://www.cafepress.com/gvl|Cafe Press page]]. I didn't even find out
    that they were going to do it until I received a <em>thong</em> in the mail with
    my design on it. Talk about a surprise. "

  body: Spreadshirt is outstanding quality, arguably better than screenprinting for
    vector designs. Their base prices are more reasonable, and there are no surprises
    lurking in the terms of service.
