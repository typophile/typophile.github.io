body: "Reading about the typeface Starling, one place the controversy as to the origins
  of Times Roman is discussed notes that the italic of Times Roman was not copied
  from William Starling Burgess' work, which included only five italic characters
  (on which the italic of Starling was based), but was a \"standard Monotype italic\".\r\n\r\nI
  never thought there was anything peculiar about the italic of Times Roman; I thought
  it matched the roman of that typeface well, and did not look just like the italic
  of any other typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever, another member of the Times family did not
  impress me as favorably. Perhaps the experts on this forum can tell me if I'm crazy
  or not... but it had always seemed to me that while Times Roman itself looked neutral
  and international, Times Titling looked excessively \"British\". That was also a
  characteristic of Gill Sans, another face which I personally did not like that much.\r\n\r\nAs
  it happens, though, more recently, taking a closer look at Times Titling and comparing
  it with other faces, it seems to me to be almost identical with Perpetua Titling,
  and Perpetua Titling looks like Perpetua while Times Titling, at least to me, doesn't
  seem to look all that much like Times. Comments?"

  body: How does one acquire a Times Titling sample these days to evaluate it? Is
    it available in digital (and if so from whom) or just metal?

    on Google Books in the preview of V&M Typographical's "The Type Specimen Book"
    from Wiley.
