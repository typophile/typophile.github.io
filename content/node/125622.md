  I\_guess, at least some of you can share the pain of proofing the copy for typographical
  errors.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m building Typopo, an online tool that wipes
  out frequent typos in English, Slovak, Czech and Rusyn language.\r\n\r\nFeeling
  that this tool might be helpful to you, let me share the link where you can try
  it \u2192 http://typopo.tota.sk/ \r\n(Alternatively, take a\_look at the feature
  list at my GitHub account \u2192 https://github.com/surfinzap/typopo)\r\n\r\nYour
  feedback on how to make this tool more useful would be much appreciated."
