body: "OK I'm in the rut with this one!. \r\n\r\nThe name of the brand will be FACE
  FWD. Apparel. (as Face Forward). It will be an urban clothing brand - it wont be
  hip hop oriented, but more towards modern vintage look vs. urban grunge style. \r\n\r\nI
  need some idea for the kind of type that will go on with circular logo and soft
  facial curves. And I'm stuck with room full of type scribbles of failure."
