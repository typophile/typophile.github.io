  body: "Book covers of this era generally used hand lettered titles rather than direct
    application of fonts.\r\nThere is a font with the almost identical letter-forms,
    but a narrower aspect created by Sol Hess in 1938 as Spire. There are digital
    versions by Ann Pomeroy that could be expanded in width. Use the regular version
    and substitute some letters, such as _R_ from the expert version.\r\nRegular\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpireRegInUseAsBells_4149.gif]\r\nExpert\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpireExpertInUseAsBells_5208.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/spire/\r\nDon"
