body: "I am trying to get in touch with Andre Gurtler. Andre are you there? I recommend/require
  your book \"Experiments with Letterform and Calligraphy\" for my students and now
  alas it is out of print. I have long been trying to contact you. Hopefully this
  will reach you, or someone who knows you. How about a paperback version??? I will
  be glad to help. I feel your book is the key to spanning the gap between handwritten
  letterform, typography, and the rest of painterly self expression. Ann M\r\n"
