  \r\n\r\nI sent it to FontLab for a checkup. Pretty soon I got a reply from them,
  and they could not point to individual character, but I got a replay:\"\u2026the
  problem is in the CFF compression. This is a AFDKO issue I think. If you turn off
  the \"Use subroutines to compress outlines...\" option in FLS before you export
  FontBook will accept the font.\"\r\n\r\nThis was all new to me, and since I make
  commercial typefaces, I need to make sure they work. I got help from this forum
  about installing the font without FontBook, but the font; the end product, is supposed
  to work everywhere, so I was somewhat relieved that FontLab advise cleared the issue.\r\n\r\nBut
  what are these CFF compression and AFDKO? And should I know more about them?"

  body: For what it's worth, CFF compression always works fine for me. There must
    have been something about the font that kept the compression routines from working
    correctly. I wonder if it was because the font was lacking some of the uppercase
    characters (as you mentioned in the other thread). Someone from Adobe might know
    the answer.

    the outlines are too complex; thus this is a nasty problem with distressed type.

  body: "Compressing outlines is useless. Fonts are small enough. And the hinting
    of a compressed font is often misinterpreted, if you open it in FontLab. In most
    cases it is a violation of licenses, but I for my part don\u2019t contact foundries
    in cases, in which I am able to tune or correct fonts, remapping of characters
    for example. Well, if I can avoid it, I don\u2019t use FontLab for those corrections,
    but many people use it. And there may be cases, in which you want to open your
    own OTF in FontLab. Except from that I think, there was a problem with the AFDKO
    (the autohint program), if the outlines are compressed."

    is a bug concerning the \"depth\" of recursive subroutines, which results in very
    modular, repetitive typefaces to compress very well but actually invalidate the
    spec, so Mac OS X revokes them. The AFDKO 2.5 library that is available as a standalone
    product and will be incorporated into Fontographer 5 and FontLab Studio 6 no longer
    has this bug. \r\n\r\nAs an interim measure, I do recommend turning the CFF compression

  body: "@ Thomas\r\n\r\nWith regard to the hinting I only saw the FontLab bug, when
    it decompiles fonts. More to the point, I saw a problem with hint substitution
    and counter hints (vstem3/hstem3) in the small letter m, as far as I remember.
    Formerly I first generated fonts with FontLab, then I used the autohint program,
    that belongs to the AFDKO and in the end I tried to correct a few things in FontLab.
    And FontLab did damage the hinting on opening the fonts (but not on generating
    them). (Meanwhile I use the AFDKO autohinting program directly in FontLab.) The
    hints are likewise in the cff table and the subroutine compression applies also
    to the hints.\r\n\r\nAnd with regard to the server I don\u2019t understand, what
    you mean. Converting fonts to the woff format is a question of seconds. In the
    woff format even digitally signatures survive. The subroutine compression changes
    fonts, woff or gzip don\u2019t. And the server does not make a difference between
    woff and otf. By the way, I may be wrong, but does the server really unpacks gzipped
    files? Or does the browser unpack them? If the server unpacks them, where is the
    advantage of gzipped files, except from sparing storage on the server? Well, I
    should google for the answer.\r\n\r\nThomas, I am burning to see Adobe\u2019s
    new PS hinting tutorial. Do you know, if it is already finished?"

    refers to Gzip, not WOFF. The server doesn't unpack them, but it has to know about
    which files are Gzipped.\r\n\r\nI wasn't in any way objecting to using WOFF, just
    pointing out that there is a significant chunk of web font delivery out there
    that is neither WOFF nor EOT, and a noticeable chunk of users can't easily use
    Gzipped fonts (or don't know how to change their server configuration), meaning
    that there is still an advantage to natively compressed fonts.\r\n\r\nBut what
    I'm missing the boat on is, nobody who is sane wants to serve OpenType CFF fonts
    as web fonts now anyway, as their rendering in Windows browsers sucks. The browsers-of-the-future
