  body: The complete collections of Fontshop and Font Bureau. There are probably some
    others worth considering, but those two would keep me covered until they go out

    lot of other favorites so I would buy that also. Then I would need a way faster
    computer and an assistant with a very good memory to remember what fonts I have.\r\n"
