  about that. \r\nSome other things had to be taken care of...\r\n\r\nAnyway, here
  is what I'd like to show you today:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://dimmys.com/albums//PortFolio1141743213/1144447576comixlogo.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
  the info is on the image. \r\nI'd be happy to hear about any flaws you see in the
  type as well as the overall logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time in advance! :)\r\n"

    is that true around the world?\r\n2. I didn't see the birds untill I read the
    discription. maybe if the birds are reversed in black within the letters. they
    would still look like they are sitting, just on the baseline.\r\n\r\nanyways,
    i wish I could see the site.\r\n"

    body: "There might be some typos, I trully apologize about that :( \r\nYou might
      be right about the birds as well. The logo is, unfortunately, in its finished
      state, but before that it was viewed by various people from this \"comix-community\".
      I didn't consider that they wouldn't have a problem recognising the pigeons,
      but for \"first-see-ers\" it might be puzzling...\r\nThank you for bringing
      that up, I will be interested to hear if someone else also had a problem with
      this? :/\r\n\r\nI also thought someone might find the \"dot\" of the \"i\" a
      bit strange :/ When I look at it now, I think it could have been.. more consistent
      with the rest of the type. It seems a bit \"slim\" compared to the rest, doesn't
      it? :/\r\n\r\nps: The site is far from fantastic right now, you are not missing
      much ;)"

    was some kind of flames coming off the top. "

    ideas like maybe make the type have pointy tops so the bird cant sit on it and
    make the pigeon a symbol on the side. just a thought after seeing all those anti
    pigeon things in the city.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I recognised the shapes as birds, and eventually as pigeons, however pigeons
    aren't a symbol of freedom (in the UK at least), doves are used as symbols of
    peace. \r\nThe logotype looks strong, though I would look at the counters of the
    B and the bottom right of the G, as well as the dot on the i (I wonder if you
    need that at all). As for the text to the right try using the logotype (possibly
    without the pigeons) instead of the approximation of it. The actual text has a
    problem with the narrow measure, especially the second paragraph which is very
    ragged, making it broader should help, if you can bring incorporated up to the
    line above. The third paragraph seems to have a fourth paragraph (I chose this\u2026)
    without a line break.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you so much for your time! \r\nYou've been of great help.\r\n\r\ntimd,
    I agree with you completely...\r\nThe treatment of the G though, was the hardest
    thing of all. \r\nBecause if I made the radius of its inner circle smaller, then
    it's different from the C. However, right now, as you can see, the right bottom
    of the G is a bit heavy...\r\nThat's just as good as I could get it :("
