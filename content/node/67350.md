  its original decals.  I would be interested to know what anyone would have to say
  about the 2 different type/fonts used on the decal in the photograph. I am working
  with Adobe Illustrator CS4 in an attempt to recreate the decal- the Lettering is
  the hardest part.  All letters have a 'shadow', any tips or hints?  Thank you, Jamie
  Wallace, Columbus, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_4543

  body: "I expect both were custom work. THOR is a classic example of \"stovepipe\"
    or \"gaspipe\" lettering, which was usually worked out in a modular form on squared
    paper. Letterhead fonts have one called [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/unionthug.php|Union
    Thug]], but it is currently only available as a free gift for spending $99 or
    more! Have you tried drawing this on a grid in Illustrator?\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rockwell/|Rockwell]]
    was a fairly common slab serif at this time. It would be quite easy to modify
    that to get the TWIN MOTOR."
