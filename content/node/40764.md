  body: "Since you raised a question about it, Chase, I wonder if any other LFE users
    have had a problem with disappearing typefaces? Every few weeks, some faces in
    my library just seem to vanish. Some faces seem more subject to disappearance
    than others, but I can't ascribe the problem to a since face or family.\r\n\r\n(Yes,
    I have the most recent version for Mac OS X.)"

  body: "hi akma,\r\n\r\nhad the same thing some minutes ago (disappearing typefaces)
    -\r\n\r\nit happened when adding typefaces per drag and drop to fontExplorer,
    since the typefaces are simply moved and not copied or relativly linked - \r\n\r\nbut
    you can always drag them back from fontExplorer into your own fonts folder and
    you'll get a zip file there - did not yet find out to which exact location the
    files are moved.. \r\n\r\n..just a short reply -\r\n\r\nbest :)"
