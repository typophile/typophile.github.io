		<div class="commentbody"><p>And then you try to negotiate with someone who&rsquo;ve been exposed to this log-o-tron.</p>
<p><strong>A typical conversation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Them:</strong> So, you are a designer..is that like, you work with computers and stuff?
<strong>Me:</strong> Well I do, but it&rsquo;s just a small fraction of it, a computer is just a tool..
<strong>Them:</strong> Year, right, so, what is it that you do? A Designer of what?
<strong>Me:</strong> Well, what you see around you, posters billboards, books, signage, packages..websites (on rare occasions)
<strong>Them:</strong> Ah ! So you are a webdesigner!
<strong>Me:</strong> Well not so much, I dabble on occasion but..
<strong>Them:</strong> Hey, you know what, my daughter needs a logo for her band, I still have a few minutes before I have to head back, can you make one for her before I leave?
<strong>Me:</strong> Well, see now, designing a logo takes a lot of effort, and it&rsquo;s not just a mark, what we do is create identity systems..
<strong>Them:</strong> Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, I see logos every day, they are tiny things, you can make a dozen in five minutes. I&rsquo;d do it myself, but I can&rsquo;t draw, tell you what, just draw me a picture and I&rsquo;ll put in the text and everything, My cousin showed me how to do shadows and other cool things in Photoshop!
<strong>Me:</strong> Identity design is probably the most difficult discipline within the field of graphic design, it requires one to sift through countless concepts to arrive at a finished, concise form that embodies a whole score of ideas, is unique, and pleasing to the eye. You have to appeal to the target, and after all, a logo is just a tip of the iceberg. A logo by itself is just a mark, what makes it magic, is an expansive and detailed identity system, that establishes a particular style to all areas of visual communication, from architecture to the color of your toilet paper.
<strong>Them:</strong> Well, thats just a load of corporate nonsense isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s just a way for you guys to raise your price. All I need is a simple little logo. I don&rsquo;t even mind if it only has two colors, and I can add the shadow myself. I was going to order it from one of those online logo places, but they are charging $50! Isn&rsquo;t that ridiculous? 50 bucks for a tiny picture. Who&rsquo;d ever pay that? If you want payment, I can give you this gift certificate for $35 at Quick-E-Mart. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>And then you accept their commission, because they are distant friends of your relatives and you can&rsquo;t say no, or for that matter, ask for a fair price:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Here are three directions that we can take to develop your identity.
<strong>Them:</strong> Oou! It looks pretty good, but I don&rsquo;t like the green.
<strong>Me:</strong> The green is there to blah-blah-blah&hellip; but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What we have to decide, is which of the three do we pick and work on further.
<strong>Them:</strong> Oh, I think the left one is the best of the bunch, but I thought about it some more this past week, and I think we should have strawberries. I&rsquo;ve asked my friends and my partner, they all agree, that strawberries are a good positive image.
<strong>Me:</strong> Eh?
<strong>Them:</strong> And here is a font that I fond on the web, it&rsquo;s modern and forward-looking.
<strong>Me:</strong> But..
<strong>Them:</strong> So, if you could just take that design on the left, put a strawberry on top, and write the text in ZZ_Type_Kool, we&rsquo;ll be golden.
<strong>Me:</strong> Hang on a minute&hellip; /Writes up a 2-page essay explaining the value of quality design, the difference between kitsch and avantgard, the meaning of professionalism and the role of a designer as conceptual communicator./
<strong>Them:</strong> /After skipping through to the least sentence in the essay/ Stop being difficult! I am paying you money, and should be entitled to get what I ask. I even found you the font (ZZ_Type_Kool) so you don&rsquo;t even have to search for one. My insurance company needs a pink strawberry on top of a shining golden spear, and I expect to get it. If $100 I paid is not enough, I can add 20 more for your troubles.
<strong>Me:</strong> So why do you even need a designer?
<strong>Them:</strong> I can&rsquo;t draw strawberries. Look, I&rsquo;ve worked with other designers before, and it was always very easy, I tell them what I want, they do it and get paid. See what they did for me? /shows a juggernaut of piss and glitter/
<strong>Me:</strong> But that&rsquo;s horrible!
<strong>Them:</strong> All designers say that about the work of all other designers! And it only cost me $50.</p>
