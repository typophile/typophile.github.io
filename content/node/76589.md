  but here goes:\r\nI am a student studying typography and pretty much just starting
  with Fontlab. Besides having all the usual English characters I am also adding Latvian
  ones as it is my native language.\r\nAll was normal and all the glyphs worked, but
  then at one point I noticed that when wanting to preview for example \u0101 it showed
  the correct character in the window where I type what I want to see, however in
  the preview window my font had defaulted back to a. The same happened with \u0113\u012B\u0146\u0137\u013C\u0146
  etc.\r\nIf i now generate the font, these characters are not included.\r\nI tried
  to open a preinstalled font that has all these glyphs but the same thing happens
  - it just doesnt show them and defaults back to the basic characters.\r\nDoes anyone
  have any idea why this could be happening?\r\nThanks in advance."

    and so on, or you can drag them to metrics window from the main font window where
    all the glyphs are on display. Besides making kerning classes helps \r\n_K: K'

  body: Thanks! However it slows down the workflow and it doesn't explain why I was
    able to type normally before or why when generating the font it excludes all the
    special glyphs from the final font file.

  body: "Thanks Kristian! Codepages indeed were the problem, now it exports the glyphs
    properly. It's rather weird though because it was exporting them normally before
    and I didn't change anything there inbetween... Now none of the codepages were
    actually enabled.\r\n\r\nShame about not being able to type the characters directly,
    but I guess I can live without that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the answers!"
