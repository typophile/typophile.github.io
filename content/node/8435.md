body: 'Here&#39;s a logo that I&#39;m working on, unfortunately I&#39;m not budgeted
  to spend too much time on it, so I&#39;d appreciate any feedback I receive.  I&#39;ve
  learned so much from reading Leslie Cabarga&#39;s Bible and I want to incorporate
  this into the logo; like points in extrema, stroke contrast, etc.  This early work-in-progress
  version was created a few months back. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s based on the Sho-Bud logo
  which you can see at: <BR><a href="http://www.shobud.org/" target="_blank">http://www.shobud.org/</a>
  <BR> <BR>The extra letters are based on Loki Cola: <BR><a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?q=loki+cola&amp;nb_ppp_old=10&amp;page=1&amp;text=Shot+Jackson&amp;nb_ppp=10&amp;classt=alpha"

  <BR> <BR>So I&#39;ve been tweaking these to make them blend together.  The client
  wants the Shot Jackson logo to look like the Sho-Bud one &#40;they own Sho-Bud&#41;.  I&#39;ve
  marked some changes that I&#39;m going to start working on, and some changes that
  the client has requested.  So I thought I&#39;d ask for some feedback and ideas
  before I get started.  Let the slaughter begin!  Thanks!     <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: As for the k-s junction, you may be able to solve the thickness and join problem
    by making the leg of the K flow into a decreasing-thickness stroke, and cross
    it with the &#39;curl&#39; of the s.

  body: Chase, <BR> <BR>Thanks that&#39;s a great idea!  So the &#39;k&#39; would
    join the &#39;s&#39; at the bottom instead of the top... I&#39;ll try that.  Thanks!
