  <BR> <BR>Since my first font i have build lots of &#34;pseudo&#34; typefaces, read
  and saw lots of typohile threads. <BR> <BR>This is a new font i&#39;m building,
  that I want to use for a new brand. &#40;Custom type&#41;. I&#39;ve just spend  a
  few hours in Freehand and Fontlab, so this is a &#34;work in progress&#34;. I wish
  to create a light version, and a bold. &#40;i&#39;m affraid of the italic&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sad because i&#39;ve printed some 9/12pt samples, and this isn&#39;t
  readable. Help me! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: This is too modular, light and tight to be very readable. <BR>Are you sure
    it shouldn&#39;t just be a display face? It would work nicely as such. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    it looks like the font didn&#39;t embed right into the PDF. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: What Hrant said. <BR>Also, there are some formal incoherencies, that I find
    disturbing. For example, uppercase and lowercase doesn&#39;t seem to work together,
    they look different things. <BR> <BR>And just FYI, Rub
