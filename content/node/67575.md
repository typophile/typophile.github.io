  choices of vintage oil cans. See attached reference. \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated, ie. what decade these were influenced by and digital replicas of the
  fonts used. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/5256/oilcanrefcontactsheet1.jpg\r\n\r\n"

    hand lettered. \r\n\r\nNice stuff."
