  \"Organic Capitals\" April 17 & 18 and \"Compressed Styles (Black letter)\" May
  1 & 2. To see complete workshop details www.cooper.edu/ce\r\n\r\nThese workshops
  are appropriate for people who have some background in lettering or calligraphy
  and are already\r\ncomfortable using a broad edged pen. Absolute beginners will
  struggle but if you're up for the challenge Julian is an excellent teacher to begin
  with. \r\n\r\nJulian Waters is the son of calligrapher Sheila Waters and bookbinder/conservator
  Peter Waters. He also studied extensively with the legendary type designer Hermann
  Zapf, who later picked Julian as his successor to teach the summer master classes
  at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Julian\u2019s clients have included
  the U.S. Postal Service, National Geographic, and many agencies, institutions and
  companies. His typeface designs include Adobe Waters Titling Pro and a custom typeface
  family for the new Visitors Center at Jefferson\u2019s Monticello where he was the
  typographic designer/advisor. He has received many awards from the Type Directors
  Club, Gra\xACphis, Art Directors Club, Print, and Letter Arts Review, among others.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bismarck_4950.jpg]"
