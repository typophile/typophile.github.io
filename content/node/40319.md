  first 40 years. It\u2019s hard to think of a more exciting look at 40 years of American
  pop culture than I can find here. And for a designer, it\u2019s just a dream. Every
  issue of the magazine up to May 2007 is in here, including the ads. 98,000 pages
  of design is a hell of a lot to look at."
