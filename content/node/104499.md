  body: "Agree its a rip of Kaufmann, the Comic Sans of of the 1940s & 1950s. Published
    by various foundries under that name. Also some others including <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-swing-bold/\">LTC
    Swing Bold</a>. I even noticed it in an old copy of \"From Tenderfoot to King's
    Scout.\" For a show about creativity, it's disappointing that the designers at
    American Idol did not try something more original.\r\nDon"
