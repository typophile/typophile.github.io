body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic design student, and we've currently been
  given a project to design a restaurant identity. Now, I've chosen quite a complex
  theme - it's hard to describe - just think \"grandma\" \"cozy cafe\" \"arts'n'crafts\"
  \"vintage/retro\". So my idea is focusing somewhat on pretty decorative features
  but not heavily so. I don't like the tacky flowery crockery idea if you get me!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  so after a few concepts, I've come up with this (semi final) logo design, and I
  want to know what you think. I have had some positive feedback from peers, but I'd
  like some more harsh and detailed criticm, you know? I've added the full poster
  image too, so you get more of a taste of the look I'm trying to get.\r\n\r\nI'm
  only at a rough draft stage, so not much attention to detail has been paid. I want
  to know if the typeface design is okay, if I should vertically align the text (I
  have it aligned so that the slopes of the two beginning and end initials align on
  an angle) or keep it the way I have it, and whether or not the bird even looks ok.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time :)\r\n\r\nSamantha\r\n\r\n"

- body: "I think it has a ton of potential and you're surely on the right track. The
    font matches both the mark and the concept rather well. I like the way the thorns
    relate to the font, but they're not quite unified yet. Perhaps three refined thorns
    would be enough?\r\n\r\nThere are some technical problems. I suggest you mock
    up a business card and center the logo in it, then print it at actual size. You
    expose so much that way! IMO, printing different sizes is a very important exercise
    in logo development. Logos need to be readable at two inches (or even less) and
    if the mark becomes a blob when it's small, it's no longer doing it's job. If
    it needs to be big to show off it's true character, it's just not working, either.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    the bird illustration is cute, but it feels kinda clip-arty. See what you can
    do to make sure it feels unique and stands out from the ... ahh, flock. There
    are a million ways to draw birds, so look around. A website with tons of unique
    bird art is: http://www.weebirdy.com/birdies/\r\n\r\nGood luck, and keep us updated
    with your revisions!"

    details are going to get lost when smaller.\r\n\r\nKeep up :)"

  body: "I agree with the thorn comment. Maybe a few tight thorns would be better.
    Less barbed wiry? I'm also not usually a fan of tracked out lowercase letters
    either. I don't mind them so much here, but did you try playing around with small
    caps to acheive the same spaced out and light effect? \r\n\r\nIn the case of the
    bird, I agree with the above as well. At small sizes he'll become a blob of indiscernible
    black. maybe try opening up the tail white a bit and the other whites throughout
    as well. But yes, this mark is definitely headed down a nice path.\r\n\r\nFor
    your poster, maybe try a dar gray mixed with a touch of color to soften up that
    harsh black on those soft pink colors. I think it will mesh better and feel truer
    with your layout\r\n\r\nw|m"
