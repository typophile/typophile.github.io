    sentence. \r\n\r\nAre you asking if another company uses this typeface in their

    but he cannot seem to remember which one exactly.\r\n\r\nThe style does look familiar
    indeed. Something to do with cars or racing I think."

  body: yes. epsilicon has right. I want to ask, if this style, this useage of "R"
    (like in the 2nd example) with this typeface is just for me is familiar, or it's
