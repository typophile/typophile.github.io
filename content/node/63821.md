  will be open late and have event.  I am going to be part of a team of stylists,
  make-up artists, and so on, who will let visitors get proper make-up, a photo shoot,
  and be put in a classic record cover of their choice. I will be the graphic designer,
  which means I have to find out which typefaces were used in these covers, so I can
  put it all together on the spot. So, I need some extra eyes to find the right ones.
  I would never hear the end of it if I used the wrong ones, Amsterdam is pretty crowded
  with Typo/Popular Culture-people.\r\n\r\nOk, here they are:"

    is a modified Bifur\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/42125\r\n\r\n\"Arctic Monkeys\"
    is custom, \"Thriller\" and \"Nina Hagen\" are handmade."

    uses an italic Futura for \"CELEBRATION\" and I thought the \"MADONNA\" was Bell
    Gothic, but it isn't. It has large traps like that though."
