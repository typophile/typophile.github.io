  for each of them. Does anyone know of some inexpensive fonts which are similar to:\r\n\r\n-
  Requiem\r\n- Mercury Display/Mercury Text\r\n- Gotham\r\n\r\nI know that you pay

  Would really appreciate any help with this.\r\n\r\nBest, Shaun"

    weights of Farnham at <A HREF=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham\">Font
    Bureau</A> which is based upon the same type model as Mercury.\r\n\r\nAn alternative
    to Gotham would be <A HREF=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.107898.0.0\">Avenir</A>.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason you like these typefaces is because they are done by some of the best type
    designers alive today. You will not find cheap versions of good type though. So
    save up and get the good ones. Any project you use them on will be all the better
    for it."

    some fonts have a refinement that is lacking in the cheaper ones.\r\n\r\nOn that
    note, do you know any sites that give a good introduction to fonts and faces?
    I'm looking for a site that gives some good practical and useful information and

    which (a) enables him to identify about any typeface on sight (b) forces him to
    compile handy lists of alternatives and (c) gives him a compulsive obsession to
    <em>help</em> anyone requesting his assistance. Or to put it bluntly -- he's a
    thoroughly nice guy who values people over profit. And I know a hell of a lot

    disappointment.\r\n\r\nAnd this actually is not such a good comparison, because
    Hoefler&Frere-Jones aren't in the \"Porshe\" price range at all. They're a little
    more expensive, but their price tag is fair, and far less than some of the <em>truly</em>
    expensive foundries."

    In this specific case Shaun needed fonts that he could buy that were similar to
    HF&J. Proxmia Nova is very close to Gotham and he can purchase the individual
    weights he can use now and the same for the other fonts. There is such a thing
    as the 'broke designer'.\r\n\r\nAs for your malfunctioning analogy about the Porshe...
    if you can't afford one- you buy a Miata or S-2000 and get equal thrills. As with
    cars or type designers there is somebody making type at your budget that does
    it right too. \r\n\r\nIn fact I think Proxima Nova has better harmony of the capitals
    and lowercase than Gotham does.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :o)"

  body: "Oh, but I totally agree about Proxima Nova and the price argument in general,
    I think you misunderstood me. It was the absurdity -- for me anyway -- of the
    original question that struck me. You know: cleaning up an \"inferior\" font in
    FontForge. It would take a lot of work and you still wouldn't have a good quality
    typeface. You better license something decent at a somewhat lesser price, just
    like the excellent suggestions Stephen and others made. Mind you, while I'm not
    exactly broke, I <em>do</em> have to carefully consider every personal type license
    myself, so I know what Shaun's talking about.\r\n\r\nAnd to avoid any misinderstandings
    -- I certainly can't afford to drive a Porshe, but then again I don't exactly
    feel the need to. Alternatively my drum kit and my three kids fit in the back
    of my second-hand minivan and I'm perfectly fine with that."

    here with these kinds of requests, rather than being offended. and to use the
    car analogy, everyone knows what a Porsche is, but they don't know how to determine
    which typeface is a Porsche, and which is a Yugo. Give people the benefit of the
    doubt once and a while. Not every person with this type of question is just looking
    for a free ride.

    you simply need to tell your boss not to hanker after what she can't afford; if
    her idea of achieving economy is to have you spend your weekends cleaning up inferior
    faces in fontforge, then maybe she has some undeclared vices of her own...\r\n\r\n<em>
    ...educate the people...</em> my students often download dodgy free fonts in an
    attempt to save on time, effort or money; when I tell them to turn the downloaded
    font into outlines, the application they're using invariably crashes, taking their
    (unsaved?) project work with it. Usually it only takes a couple of instances of
    this before they get the idea."
