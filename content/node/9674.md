  body: I like it. <BR>I think the &#39;o-r&#39; needs to be improved, <BR>and the
    &#39;c&#39; maybe too narrow needs to be <BR>rotated a little bit clockwise. <BR>
    <BR>Regards, <BR>Alessandro

  body: Hey there <BR> <BR>Looks nice - I think there is a problem with the r, the
    i and the begining of the n. How can I explain this...hmmm. they seem to look
    like type thats &#34;just&#34; been cut of by the outline of the other letters
    close to them. Take the &#34;i&#34;. Its ends to &#34;pointy&#34; to &#34;sharp&#34;.
    The whole logo is very round and nice but there are those 3 places that just looks
    wrong - like you need to work those areas a bit more...  <BR> <BR>Am I wrong?
    Did it make sense? <BR> <BR>Mark

  body: Hi everyone, <BR>I&#39;m back with a little change in the logo...  <BR> <BR>After
    trying some ideas and sugestions, I realized that the only thing that was bothering
    me in this logo was the &#39;or&#39;. So, I focused on that and came up with this
    option...  <BR> <BR>I could use your considerations, opinions and sugestions...  <BR>
    <BR>thanks a lot. <BR>Guilherme Menga. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67593.gif"

  body: I would like to see the vertical of the r at the bottom of the o. Have you
    tried a 2 storey a which might help with Dav&#40;id&#41;&#39;s observation and
    the ca join? <BR>Tim

  body: 'Hi Guilherme, <BR> <BR>I think this is an ok idea, but I think you need to
    be careful not to over do it. It would need just the right word to make &#34;organic&#34;
    ligatures happen between every letter and not look contrived &#40;this is the
    trouble I see with your design&#41;. If you have to resort to overlapping letters
    and adding little white spaces, it&#39;s probably not a natural combination like
    LA or rt <BR> <BR>Consider backing away from the ligature idea a few notches and
    restricting them to the places where they fit naturally which is this case is
    pretty much nowhere. <BR> <BR>I would start by adding enough space between the
    letters that each stands on its own, with enough balance between white and black.
    Then maybe consider these more subtle connections: <BR>1. Bring the leg of the
    n to loop into the i <BR>2. Bring the ear of a two story g into the top of a two
    story a  <BR> <BR>Or try a new idea intirely. There are lots of ways you could
    suggest organic: <BR>- How about more natural and totally non-geometric? <BR>-
    Try drawing your logo by drizzling chocolate syrup. At least you can eat the results
    that turn out bad. &#40;scanning would be a problem though :-&#41; <BR>- <a href="http://www.chank.com/designcamp.php"
