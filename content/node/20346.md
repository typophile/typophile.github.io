  body: "I don't know if this is exactly what you mean, since I dont know about the
    \"x_x\" convention, but InDesign has preferences where you can choose if all ligatures
    in the font should come automatically, or not.\r\n\r\nSo if I type \"flow\" -
    then there would automatically be a ligature instead of f and l.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Probably you were talking about something else more technical, I guess\u2026 =)"

  body: "Paul, \r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what you mean. I've never heard that arbitrary
    ligatures would work in Type 1 fonts. \r\n\r\nFor Type 1 fonts with Adobe Standard
    Encoding, the two standard ligatures \"fi\" and \"fl\" will work as ligatures
    if they are named with the names used by the Adobe Standard Encoding itself (i.e.
    \"fi\" and \"fl\" rather than \"f_i\" and \"f_l\"), simply because they always
    have been part of the Adobe Standard Encoding. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "BTW, this is the reason why FontLab Studio 5's STANDARD.NAM file has the
    old-style names \"fi\" and \"fl\" for exactly those two ligatures. Names for all
    other ligatures should be formed using the underscore convention (\"f_f\", \"f_f_i\"
    etc.) but for these two, the \"fi\" and \"fl\" names without the underscore are
    probably better if you generate your fonts as both OpenType and Type 1. \r\n\r\nAs
    usual, I simply recommend following the FontLab Studio 5 STANDARD.NAM practices
    of glyph naming and encoding unless there is really a good reason not to. Note
    that in FontLab Studio 5.0.2, the naming was updated (see http://fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FontLab-Studio-5.0.2/
    for details) and I recommend all FontLab Studio 5 users to get the update. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Paul,\r\nDo you mean they load without the liga feature being written for
    them? or do you mean they only load automatically with that syntax in the feature
    code? As Adam says, fl and fi are standard and should load in any case.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "adam, last night i was testing this hypothesis just a bit with a font that
    had an ll ligature. i named the glyph l_l, generated a PST1 font (for Windows),
    installed the font, opened InDesign, selected preset text, selected the font i
    had just installed, and presto! the l_l ligatures were inserted without any OpenType
    programming. The ligatures persited even when i unchecked the ligatures option.\r\nI
    believe this is the source of the problem with some postscript fonts automatically
    substituting discretionary ligatures when they are not wanted (as has been documented
    elsewhere on these forums): they just exist in the font and InDesign calls them
    when they are named c_t & s_t."

  body: I noticed this when I was working on Grad (OT-CFF). I hadn't added any features,
    but the ligatures all worked (whether or not I wanted them to). I used the x_x
    naming convention. After I added the features to specify liga, dlig, etc., they
    worked correctly, of course.
