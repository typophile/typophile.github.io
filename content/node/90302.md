  body: What is the logic of using something "similar" to something you think is "overused"?  Wouldn't
    it make more sense to go with a different style instead of trying to match letterforms?

  body: Well..it's a the right kind of typeface for the project, BUT specifically,
    Klavika is rather recognisable and having something similar (but distinct) is
    extremely useful here..
