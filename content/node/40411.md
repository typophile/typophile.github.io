  are out of my meager range.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it begs the question, what was the first
  typeface that you purchased?\r\n\r\nthe ones interesting me are:\r\n[[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sans/sans_demi.html|Foundry

    Verlag definitely is worth the money. Do you need <em>all</em> the weights? I\u2019d
    choose a 10 weights bundle; those $199 will pay off soon. (Hey, the Dollar is
    cheap! :\xB0)\r\n\r\nFoundry Sans isn\u2019t a bad font either, but I personally
    would rather go with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/syntax/\">Syntax</a>.
    That\u2019s a true classic, to me. You can pick single weights in OpenType format
    for as little as $29.\r\n\r\nWhat will you use the fonts for? All your choices
    are sans-serif. I don\u2019t say you can\u2019t have more than two sans, hell
    no; or that Meta and Foundry Sans are in any way similar, but you should be aware
    that right now you\u2019re covering only a certain corner of the type universe.\r\n\r\n<cite>Univers
    47</cite>\r\nWhat I like about Univers (and what makes/made it outstanding) is
    its systematic approach: <a href=\"http://www.100besteschriften.de/10_Univers.html#a10\">a
    multitude of weights and widths, all meticulously concerted</a> \u2026 so, it
    feels a little bit odd to pick just <em>one</em> weight out of this system. (Then,
    why not?)\r\nF\r\n\r\nOh, and my first commercially licensed font was <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Charter\">Charter</a>,
    for a university project."
