  i.d. fonts for me. \r\n\r\nI hope that one of you wise i.d.'ers out there can help
  with this... I just came across this site today, and I am in love the script font
  used here... \r\n\r\nMany Thanks in advance! :)\r\n\r\nCheers, and a happy ho-ho
  to you all!\r\nA.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CSC_6271.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
