  architectural publications from around 1930-1950. (used in two different weights,
  haven't seen any italics.) i'd be surprised if it was of finnish origin. in that
  case there would be some secret typographic history i haven't been informed about.\r\n"

  body: "thanks for all the answers. \r\n\r\ngill sans schoolbook looks very much
    like it to me. only differences seem to be the \"l\" which is a straight line,
    the \"4\" (doesn't show in the sample) which is closed and the \"y\" as mentioned,
    all pointing to the regular gill sans. \r\n\r\nthe \"M\" has slanted vertical
    lines and the center touches the baseline, which doesn't happen in any gill sans
    version i managed to find.\r\n\r\nlinotype's gill sans infant looks pretty much
    identical to the gill sans schoolbook...? both versions appear to have a thicker
    stroke than in this printed sample.\r\n\r\nis there a digital version of gill
    sans with a light cut with alternates for \"a\" and \"g\" as in schoolbook/infant?
    :)\r\n\r\nvista sans looks too condensed. fiendstar is pretty nice, the light
    version has the weight right. don't like the \"y\" though.\r\n"

    ;-}\r\n\r\nI love this stuff. Trying to ID fonts continues to be a fantastic education
    for me. I greatly respect your knowledge, as well as those of numerous other members
    here. I'm not in the same league, but it sure is interesting and rewarding to
    try. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
