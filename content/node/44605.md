  body: "Clean. Rain. Blue. Fear in deep water. Mother Earth crying for all those
    who are sad (the rain). The beginning of life. What the world really looks like
    is when you see it reflected off water, for everything is actually upside down
    and this world is dynamic, not static, symbolized by the ripples or waves.\r\n\r\nI
    have meditated on water, specifically the rain more than any other subject.\r\n\r\nThat
    was a fun waste of time.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "I will tell you a water story: I was at Echo Park Lake and I saw a dead duck
    floating in the lake. There were no ripples coming from it. Then I walked over
    to the bridge and I saw a duck sleeping. There were ripples. My conclusion: that's
    how life is, while we're alive we generate endless ripples, once we pass those
    ripples begin to subside.\r\n\r\nDucks bob on liquid glass.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "You might look at the elemental aspects. It is changeable like air in that
    it can conform to any shape or space. It can also be solid like earth as in a
    tsunami or a fast impact against the surface of water. It is cooling, as mentioned
    above. It is the nemesis of fire, able to mix with earth and air.\r\n\r\nYou might
    look at the physics of it in that it has three very common states\u2014gas, liquid
    and solid.\r\n\r\nI believe the Chinese represent it as two solid lines with a
    dashed line between, as a river might create a barier of motion that separates
    masses on land.\r\n\r\nNot to be too crunchy, but these are very old ideas.\r\n\r\nI
    took a canyoneering trek through the virgin river narrows one time. Spent about
    48 hours floating or walking through a river with vertical canyon walls on either
    side. Two German tourists died a month before on the same route as a flash flood
    came through and essentially obliterated them. Nothing was ever found. That gave
    me a real sense for the absolute force of water."

  body: "We used to do this thing with smooth flat rocks. \"cut the devil's throat\".
    The object was to throw a stone as high and far as you could, but it has to hit
    the water without a splash. You'd watch the rock sail through the air in a smooth,
    predictable arc. Spinning, it turned on its side and would drop quickly, piercing
    the surface with the merest \"thp\" and hardly a ripple and be gone. As if from
    the face of the earth. Which in a way, it was. The fall to the deep and murky
    bottom of the lake was out of sight and mind. Like everything else down there.
