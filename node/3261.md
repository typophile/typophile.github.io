  body: Yes. <BR>Typography -being free from rasterization tools- can and should deal
    with notan. Notan is created through boundaries = outlines. <BR> <BR>To me &#34;painting&#34;
    creates the bodies, hence gives more weight to the Black. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Yes, at face value &#40;no pun intended&#41;. <BR> <BR>But, I think that it
    could be argued either way depending on what the painting is doing/ what the letterforms
    are meant to represent. However, this could become a very knotted debate, so I&#39;ll
    leave it at that. <BR> <BR>&#40;This seems related to the &#39;What is typography?&#39;
    thread.&#41;
