  the least amount of pixels and is still legible. It seems to me that it would be
  possible to make all the  characters using a 5X5 pixel grid. thoughts?\r\n\r\nLance

  body: Lance, are you able to share more details about the project? If you're asking
    for such a tiny face can I assume it's for a QCIF or QCIF+ display? Tiny fonts
    very rarely (almost never) serve users that well, even on the lowest resolution
    devices.

  body: "Thank you. there are several good options here. \r\n\r\nJoe, I am actually
    just using these in a teaching presentation. I'm making a comparison between Cuneiform,
    one of our earliest examples of letterforms and pixel fonts, one of our most recent
    examples of letterforms. Cuneifrom is made up of crude triangular \"pixels\" in
    the same way that our cellphones create alphanumeric characters. \r\n\r\nLance
