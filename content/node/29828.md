  body: "cool now I'd like to see a photography school one from maybe Parson's since
    they had the best darkrooms in NYC in the 80's. But I'm sure it would come out
    a lot different since Pro Digital cameras and giclee prints are sharper than the
    best analog film prints.\r\n\r\nI'm carrying my old Nikon FM2 (film 3200 Ilford)
    today and a little canon digi just for a bit of retro fun and it's not as heavy
    as a Nikon D2X. "

  body: Letterpress always seems like it would be so much fun; it's a shame that my
    school ditched all its letterpress stuff. Fortunately it all ended up in a local
    printmaker's studio, so maybe when I'm not taking five classes a semester I'll
    get a chance to try using it.

    years ago. I bought the FTN in Japan in 1968 along with a Zenza Bronica :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    every semester. My teacher always wore the traditional printer's bow tie which,
    unlike a \"normal\" tie, could not get caught in the rollers of the press! \r\nDB~"

  body: "I've seen a few schools dump their little letterpress corner. One that did
    so about seven years ago announced to me that they were getting rid of the stuff
    because they felt it made the college appear \"backward\". In my opinion offering
    a letterpress facility for even a little of a student's early education is forward-thinking.\r\n\r\nI
    have had mature career designers attend sessions in my workshop, and most of them
    volunteered that they had learned more about type in those few days than they
    had over their entire careers.\r\n\r\nI don't suggest that a person can't get
    a grasp of typography without letterpress experience, but it does offer another
    way of thinking and makes clear the point and pica system in a tactile, real way.\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    the Typophile Film Festival to YouTube, for those of us who couldn't make the
    event?
