  to take this 'q' and 'p' and make a logo of it. I have other sites that I want to
  build as sister sites, so for scalability's sake, I (very roughly) made these...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/initialLogos_6551.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  sat on these for maybe 3 months now, and I like some things and dislike others.
  The 'c' and the 'o' work well - although the kerning on the 'c' is daft. Maybe I
  was drunk or excited, I dunno. The 'h' and the 'm' were hand created and obviously
  look wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is the wrongness of these, and the design insight of the people
  around me now that have inspired me to make the whole bleedin' font."
