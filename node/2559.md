  I&#39;d love to get your feedback on the finer points of the type. I&#39;m wrestling
  with the ligature between the M and the E, it just doesn&#39;t quite feel right
  to me. Also, the O seems a little off. Any thoughts? <BR> <BR>The business will
  works with utility companies and other big industries. We want to create a solid
  presence, while also a sense of dynamism. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear your ideas!

  body: 'Joshua: It&#39;s an okay start, but you really need to push it some. The
    ligatures work on a certain level, but I think it needs some more breathing space.
    The &#34;O&#34; looks like an egg that is about to be crushed. Also, your angles
    are all over the map and there is no consistency between the M&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    you should give some more thought to how the symbol works with the type. Can you
    integrate the two somehow creating more of a wordmark? As it stands now, it doesn&#39;t
    seem like a very original solution. Something as simple as moving the lower shape
    forward would give it more visual interest. &#40;abstracting it slightly&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I would also suggest re-working ENERGY. I am not a big fan of artificially
    skewed and stretched type. The G makes me wince. <BR> <BR>Do you have other sketches
    or directions? It might be helpful to see how you arrived at this point.'

  body: 'The &#34;o&#34; seems so claustrophobic between those MM&#39;s. everything
    is a little too &#34;italic&#34; for me, and maybe you could reduce the M logo
    to something like this &#40;with an obvious &#34;O&#34; distortion: <BR> <BR>

  body: In terms of integrating the logo and wordmark, why not drop the cap M in the
    black part? Use the cap M from the logo as the M? <BR> <BR>I like the shape of
    the O that Adriano put in, but trying to make it into ligatures with the two M&#39;s
    makes a big black blob. The way Joshua had it just touching in the first place
    was good. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Hey everyone, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback! I&#39;ve worked on the O,
    trying to make it parallel the curve of the U more. This is what I came up with,
    a bit boxy, but coming along. Also included is a preview of the business card
    I&#39;m working with. <BR> <BR>Regarding sketches and process- this is actually
    an old project which was just revitalized, I put together the rough over the summer.
    I should probably sit down and reconceptualize the piece, see where it leads me.
    <BR> <BR>Keep the good words coming! <BR> <BR>-Josh <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/23255.jpg"

  body: Josh, maybe you are looking for a harsh look, but could you look at making
    Momentum in gray instead of black, since everything runs together. Also maybe
    look at it as an outline stroke. Please make something smaller its way to crammed.
    White space please. Try making the red panel thinner left to right and Momentum
    smaller.

    seem to be off. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The motion might be more exaggerated and dynamic &#40;and interesting&#41;
    if the less important type &#40;address, etc.&#41; weren&#39;t set at an angle.
    Does the address &#40;etc.&#41; need more spacing? Is the address too light?
