body: 'I&#39;m currently breaking my head over naming conventions in OpenType. Having
  mostly used Fontlab to auto-generate OpenType and other Name fields &#40;FOND, menu,
  etc&#41; I&#39;ve been bumping into problems with that wonderful platform known
  as Windows. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve studied the naming convention that Adobe used in Myriad
  Pro, which was cunning and complex at the same time... as well as Underware&#39;s
  Unibody font release. <BR> <BR>Both use distinctly different schemes... How should
  I be naming things? <BR> <BR>To illustrate I&#39;ll give some examples of the kind
  of issues I&#39;m having with the following kind of situations: <BR> <BR>- Unconventional
  names -- Fnord Broken vs Fnord Regular, Fnord Bold, etcetera. as well as &#39;fantasy&#39;
  weight names like &#39;C30&#39; through &#39;E70&#39;. <BR> <BR>- Big familes --
  ranging from Fnord ExtraLightItalic to ExtraBold. Not all weights show on Windows.
  <BR> <BR>The fonts I create work fine on OS X, but when using them in Adobe applications
  on a Windows machine I end up with 5 weights at most, 1 weight regular. ATM for
  Windows Light sees only one weight. <BR> <BR>How do people here set up their naming
  info? When does one use OpenType names, and when not? Is the Adobe Pro way the most
  common way?'

  body: 'I did several large OpenType families using FontLab. There is a limitation
    in Windows OS: type family should contain only four styles: Regular, Bold, Italic,
    Bold Italic. If you create crossplatform OpenType font, you have to devide the
    type family in several sub-families: <BR>Font OT Regular <BR>Font OT Italic <BR>Font
    ExtraBold OT Regular <BR>Font ExtraBold OT Italic <BR>Font Light Condensed OT  <BR>etc.
    <BR>But because I want all the styles of one family to be displayed together,
    I fill in OpenType Specific names in Font Info window. I fill it manualy: the
    first line is the same for all styles in a family. The second line is the style
    name, for example &#34;ExtraBold&#34;. To have all styles sorted by weight, select
    appropriate weight in the Basic set of font names window. The name of the weight
    shouldn&#39;t match the style name. Imporant is the number of the weight, which
    appears after selecting the weihght from the list.'

  body: Sounds like Filip has it pretty much down. That&#39;s the approach we use
    at Adobe, except working through our own FDK tools. I do the same thing when working
    with OpenType fonts in FontLab. I do tend to work in the advanced naming panel
    to work with all the name strings directly, but that isn&#39;t strictly necessary
    AFAIK. <BR>

  body: Chris, if you want to make your OpenType font really crossplatform, you have
    to follow Windows limitations. As I wrote before, in Window OS, type family can
    only contain 4 styles. You have to divide large family into several subfamilies.
    Just read my post.

    opentype.  I can see the entire family in windows when the postscript version
    is installed, but when doing just a straight conversion in Fontlab to Opentype
    I only see 4.  One would assume the names would be carried over, wouldn&#39;t
    they?

  body: Although I can now create OpenType family of eight styles or more, the font
    naming is mistery for me. Especially when I try to open fonts from families, which
    display all styles correctly. Font naming window in FL displays always very different
    ways of naming... And the FL manual makes it not very clear.

    conventions, so forget about the Menu Name, it doesn&#39;t exist in TrueType naming.

  body: You are right.  <BR> <BR>The other thing is the naming convention for styles.
    Sometimes font - usualy named Italic - is named Regular Italic &#40;which looks
    more lined up in the list of styles&#41;. Extra Bold is sometimes ExtraBold. I
    try to use only names which are in the list of styles in FL. <BR> <BR> <BR>Another
    problem is using Character Styles in application like InDesign. For one font the
    style &#34;Italic&#34; works fine, for other font, there must be separated style
    &#34;Book Italic&#34;, for other one &#34;Regular Italic&#34;, &#34;Rg Italic&#34;.
    Not to mention fonts with styles named &#34;ThreeOne&#34;, &#34;HongKongEighty&#34;
    or &#34;45 Light&#34;. I accept the reason for this kind of style naming, but
    sometimes it is not so easy to work with it - for example if you have to different
    fonts in one book and both fonts use different names for italic. <BR> <BR>On the
    other hand, I like Frutiger&#39;s idea to use numbers to describe the style. Unfortunately
    almost nobody followed him. And finaly, the new revised Linotype Next uses 3-digit
    naming convention...

    I&#39;ve had a lot of success by entering the proper weight name in the weight
    field and then only using Regular, Regular Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, in the style
    field &#40;all in the FL naming dialog 1st panel&#41;. I wonder... if you entered
    HongKongEighty in the weight field, and called it Regular in the Style field...
    would that work?'

  body: 'The name in the &#34;weight&#34; field does not directly correspond to anything
    that appears in font menus. <BR> <BR>It isn&#39;t quite right to say that OpenType
    uses TrueType naming, only. OpenType names are a superset of TrueType names. They
    add two things: <BR> <BR>- ability to specify family and style in a way that allows
    more than four members per family &#40;this is in addition to the usual Windows
    four-member families&#41; <BR> <BR>- ability to specify a Classic Mac OS menu
    name &#40;in a Mac TrueType font this would not be part of the data fork&#41;
    <BR> <BR>These extra bits live in name IDs 16, 17 and 18, and are in their own
    little panel in the FontLab Font Info dialogs. <BR> <BR>Adobe has long realized
    the amount of confusion out there over naming, style-linking and weight issues,
    which is why we often incorporate tutorials on this in our OpenType production
    workshops. However, in the past these have focused on how one controls names when
    using our own FDK tools. Clearly it would be invaluable to write up a clear explanation
    on how these things work in FontLab. I suppose I will add it to my to-do list....

  body: Filip, <BR> <BR>after dealing with the generation of the General family which
    has a letter 2 number identification system &#40;C30 through G70&#41; i can safely
    say that Frutigeresque models don&#39;t really make naming easier -- I ended up
    making each font its own family and using opentype to unite it into one listing.
    <BR> <BR>The one thing that bugs me, though, is that either a&#41; Fontlab doesn&#39;t
    generate the files the same way as the Adobe Tools or b&#41; I am an idiot. <BR>
    <BR>Why? Because I followed the naming scheme that Thomas followed on Myriad Pro
    and although 90% of the applications I tested with made it act the same way as
    Myriad, I still had a set of seperate fonts in TextEdit whereas Myriad showed
    up as a single family. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to have to guess that Fontlab messes
    up -- the way Thomas explained it to me using the Additional Opentype table probably
    doesn&#39;t have that problem, though I&#39;ll have to find some time to test
    that method.

  body: 'I&#39;m sure Rob explained this to me correctly either in this thread or
    offline, but I just had an &#34;aha!&#34; experience so I can now solve the problem.
    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the breakdown of what apps use to determine family and menu
    name info. NOTE the OS X Fonts Panel apps entry at the end.... <BR> <BR> <BR>most
    Adobe apps, other cross-platform apps: <BR> <BR>name ID 16 and 17, Windows platform
    <BR> <BR> <BR>usual Windows apps: <BR> <BR>name ID 1, Windows platform <BR>&#40;&#43;
    name ID 2 and style bits for style linking&#41; <BR> <BR>usual Mac Classic apps,
    and OS X apps not using Fonts Panel: <BR> <BR>name ID 18, Mac platform <BR>&#40;fall
    back to name ID 1 if 18 is not present&#41; <BR> <BR>Mac OS X apps using Fonts
    Panel: <BR>name ID 1 and 2, Mac platform <BR> <BR>So, the difference in the default
    behaviors between the FDK and FontLab is that the FDK makes the Mac versions of
    NameID 1 and 2 equal to the Win versions of NameID 16 and 17.  So apps using the
    Mac OS X Fonts Panel get the same behavior as Adobe&#39;s cross-platform apps.
    However, FontLab assumes that NameID 1 and 2 should be the same for Mac as they
    are for Windows, so by default it uses those values. <BR> <BR>As I had suspected
    in my earlier discussion with Rob &#40;before I knew the precise problem&#41;,
    this can be worked around by using the &#34;Additional OpenType Names&#34; panel
    to make the Mac and Win entries differ for NameID 1 and 2. <BR> <BR>I will suggest
    to Yuri that he change the default behavior for FontLab 4.6, so that it behaves
    more like the FDK in this particular regard. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps, <BR>
