  body: One has to wonder how many fractions of a point their typeface sizes are.
    The first time anyone would need an SI prefix for a point?

    it's at 41 \u03BCpoint."

    Engineering</em>\r\n\r\nHow about Sensibly Inspired Engineering. All this little
    venture proves is that, feeling rather godlike, some scientists have succeeded
    in torturing the building blocks of life into predetermined shapes, without regard
    for the consequences. Personally, I shudder to think of what kind of life form
    might emerge if you strung these letterform Frankensteins into a seven-letter
    sequence that said \u201Cbe fruitful and multiply yourself\u201D\u2014but not
    those exact words.\r\n\r\n(Props to Woody Allen)"

    you to this alternative news source:\r\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5914780/harvard-scientists-make-graphic-designers-look-lazy-by-using-dna-to-create-a-new-font
    \r\n\r\nThe letter blocks are 64-by-103 nanometers.\r\n\r\nAlso, the article in
    Nature is here:\r\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7400/full/nature11075.html\r\n\r\nThis
    also makes me wish IBM had gone ahead and made a font from the work they did on
    the atomic logo:\r\nhttp://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV1003.html\r\nhttp://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/photo/28500.wss\r\n\r\nNot
    sure Stanford could have completed the task with their even smaller technique:\r\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090130154918.htm"
