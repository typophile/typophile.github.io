body: "Hello, all. Assistance with identification would be greatly appreciated. My
  first thought, after a cursory examination, was to conclude it was easy to match
  with something like Futura, Avenir, Kabel, etc etc. Not so. This font, upon closer
  examination, has some nice little touches not present in those (or other) fonts.
  This appears to be a '20s or '30s-era style. If anyone knows its name and where
  to purchase it (or a reasonably close approximation), that would be extremely helpful.
  Thanks in advance to all.\r\n\r\n"
