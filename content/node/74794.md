  am in Fontographer and saving my .fog file with the name of the font I want, lets
  call it \"font.fog\" for now (I don't have a name for the font anyway).\r\n\r\nI
  \"generate font files\" to an .otf file and it comes out as \"Untitled Regular\".\r\neverywhere
  I save the file beforehand, it has a name. how do I tell it what weight+name this
  file should be as an .otf?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
