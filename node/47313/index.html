Right now I am interning (in exhibitions, as a graphic designer) at the National Museum of the American Indian in NY and am shocked that even in our library, we have so few examples of Native written languages. Most translations are phonetic anglicizations, which are helpful for me to pronounce (but not really!), but are absolutely ugly when compared to the Native syllabary.

ps. I think the Cherokee font is one of the most developed, but the applications I've seen of it (probably not Zapf's!) are obv. roman character driven and therefore, leave something to be desired. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">What do you mean by "the Native syllabary"? Sequoyah's Cherokee syllabary? I'm unaware of any singular and universal native American writing system developed by native Americans. (Even Sequoyah's system is clearly Latin-inspired.)

Of course, I'm no expert in this area, and would love to be enlightened.

My earlier comment about getting in touch offline was based primarily on assuming that you were looking at Latin-based systems of transcribing native languages. Even these have a very limited number of decent typefaces available....

I don't think it is so much a matter of fonts, but a matter of software -- either in the font or in the applications programs. All my experience comes from typesetting books with some of these languages, primarily Apache, Kiowa, Lakota, Navajo, and just a little with Nahuatl, Maya, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Tojolabal, Tabasco Chontal, Purepecha, Sierra Zapoteco, Isthmus Zapoteco, Mazateco, Ñahñu, Totonaco, and Huichol.

As far as I know, none of these languages had a written form other than using the Latin alphabet. The problem is the various orthographies, some dating back to people working long before laptop computers (e.g., Ella Deloria & Lakota), who would use marks easy to make with a pencil (dots at various places, for example; hard to typeset). Later, the problem was to adapt to the typewriter & to some extent print, so other marks were used -- sometimes needing a touch-up with a pen if you were limited to the typewriter.

Even here, there was no standardization across languages -- even ones with common roots, like Navajo, Apache, Kiowa, etc. (Athabaskan roots) so a nasalized vowel in one might be signaled by an ogonek, but with a macron below or underline in another. Long vowels can be denoted by doubling, or by a macron. Etc.

All these can be made up for any font, and it is much easier now with OpenType. The problem is that the Unicode Consortium will not encode new characters which contain only additional diacritics already encoded, but most fonts do not have the needed routines in any ccmp or mark feature so the characters can be easily accessed.

As to Cherokee, it is a bit political. The (at least Eastern) Cherokee have an official font; that it looks like a 1890s newspaper headline font doesn't bother them. There is some interest in making a font out of Sequoia's hand-written version of the syllabary, and it would make a nice script. Not too many Cherokees read or write Cherokee, so there is some movement to make it easier to learn by simplifying the syllabary -- by removing about half of it. The Cherokee are split on that one. Moreover, the few people at the Cherokee Museum who write Cherokee use the Linguist Software system predating Unicode, back when there were both PC and Mac formats (they use PC).

These are transitional times; we are moving from what could be easily rendered on a typewriter, or the old 126-character fonts, to what can be rendered with the  possibilities with Unicode & applications programs that support it.

I'm confused. In your first pararaph you say that fonts aren't the problem, but it seems to me that in your fourth paragraph you are saying the opposite.

These days, InDesign and the Windows version of MS Office support OpenType mark attachment and 'ccmp', so I don't see app support as being a major barrier (though support in Mac Office would be nice - it isn't there yet, is it?).

BTW, I've looked at the free (and official?) Cherokee font that's available. It's utter junk in both design and execution. Bizarrely irregular stroke weights, sidebearings chosen by rolling dice, extrema often ignored in point placement, non-Euclidean geometry of curves (oops, read too much H.P. Lovecraft!).... yes, I exaggerate, but only a little.

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm, it seems there are several Cherokee fonts available, all with pretty generic names like "Cherokee" making them hard to tell apart,

My scathing words above apply to the 1993 Cherokee font by Joseph LoCicero IV.

The 2005 official font by the Cherokee Nation and Tonia Williams, which I had looked at long ago, is not *as* bad, but still pretty awful. It can't decide whether it's monoline or if it's high-contrast Didone. No overshoots for the rounds. Inconsistent stroke weights. Inconsistent stress. Spacing needs to be thrown out and redone, because it's useless. But at least there are points at extrema.

If they're going to go to the trouble of providing keyboard drivers and such, you'd think they would/could use the proper encoding.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>I’m confused. In your first pararaph you say that fonts aren’t the problem, but it seems to me that in your fourth paragraph you are saying the opposite.</cite>

Sorry, I wasn't clear. Or precise . . . or both.

When I said "I don't think we need new fonts," I should have said I don't think we need new typefaces. I don't think there is anything wrong with setting Native American languages in Arno, or Quadraat, or any good font for the text. You shouldn't pick a font to try and make the text "look Native American" -- certainly not at the expense of that text. (I once worked with a designer who didn't want to use a "European looking" font for Lakota, so she picked Goudy Sans. Far as I'm concerned, that doesn't look good for anything.)

While the typefaces may be OK, the fonts aren't. If you don't use OpenType, you have to used hacked fonts. And even if you do use OpenType, you have to make up either characters or features; probably both. As it happens, I spent the afternoon working on Arno, so as to use it for a text with Nahuatl.

But typesetting isn't the only or most important issue. Unless there are text editors that allow the needed characters to be typed relatively easily and to appear close to correct, no one who writes will use them. I know one author who uses an ancient WordPerfect system because his manuscripts look better that way. Never mind that converting these files for typesetting is an hair-pulling, expensive chore.

And while Omniglot & Wikipedia & etc. don't get the details of Native American languages quite right, this just points up the problem. Nasalized vowels in Kiowa really shouldn't be underlined, they should have macrons below. The glottal stop in Apache is an apostrophe, but it is a "typographer" apostrophe (U+2019), not a ASCII apostrophe. Etc.

I'll allow that's a semi-elitist viewpoint. At some level, if people use underlines and ASCII apostrophes because they are there and relatively easy to use, maybe that will become the preferred orthography.  
 
My guess is something like this is what's happening with Cherokee. The Cherokee Museum already owns, and will continue to use MS Word on a PC. For them, the cost of just one copy of InDesign would mean not doing something else, and I would guess they feel the time needed to learn InDesign would probably be better spent on something else as well. They have already bought Linguist Software Cherokee (hacked Type 1 font), and have learned to use it. Why change? Upgrades cost money. Most material isn't "typeset" anyway. (I'll not comment on the Official Cherokee font, though if you look at <cite>Signs of Cherokee Culture: Sequoyah's Syllabary in Eastern Cherokee Life</cite> you will notice that the Cherokee not supplied as art was set in a different typeface.)

So, there is this tension between those of us who care for the aesthetic presentation and those who are trying to increase the use -- hence ease of use -- of these languages.</div>

It really is a shame that there are so few fonts for these languages. I am including support for Diné Bizaad (Navajo) in my typeface I am currently working on, and it is next to impossible to find any Diné text online. Of course some of this is due to the fact that it is such a little-spoken language. But I'm afraid that the lack of fonts compounds the problem of the language not being used more in print.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Navajo just requires Latin script, so I don't see how lack of fonts could be a significant issue with that language.  Also I think it is by far the most widely spoken native american language (probably over 100,000).  The reason you don't see much text is due to the extremely low literacy rate in it, and perhaps also a certain cultural lack of interest.  One example is

		<div class="commentbody">Navajo requires vowels with ogoneks. You might be amazed at how many fonts lack these -- Also, in the Wikipedia page you reference, the [[glottal stop]] is signaled by an ASCII apostrophe. Far be it from to tell Navajo's they are wrong, but the usual orthography for Navajo & most other Native American languages is the "typographer's" apostrophe, AKA raised comma (U+2019).

Note that Omniglot gets it wrong, too:

http://www.omniglot.com/writing/apache.htm

At first glance on the Omniglot site, one might think that U+0027 is correct; then you notice that Omniglot uses 0027 for an apostrophe everywhere.

Does it matter? Well, probably. In Polynesian, the glottal stop is signaled by U+2018. I've also seen proposals that the apostrophe not be used for a glottal stop, since it is confusing -- and of course, in every case, that's where 0027 is used for the apostrophe.

		<div class="commentbody">If you look more closely at the Navajo wikipedia page, you will see that it uses a mixture of 0027 and 02BC.  The latter is what is used in the English Wikipedia page on the Navajo Language.  I'm not sure that the Navajo Nation has ever decided what is correct, but I think in any case you would want to avoid any "punctuation" mark to represent an actual character, and 02BC seems reasonable to me.  

Navajo's requirement for ogoneks makes it no more disadvantaged with respect to fonts than Polish and Lithuanian.  How great is that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Navajo requires ogoneks with acute marks, including O/o with ogonek, which are found rarely in <em>any</em> fonts. These characters could be composed if combining accents are supplied in the font (also found in few fonts), but using these would require sophisticated software, unless the typeface includes OpenType programming to do this for the user automatically (which is supported by few applications). Even the Wikipedia page you linked to has the problem of using the dotted iogonek together with the acute mark, unacceptable typography in my book. Native peoples deserve good type options as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul is right. For some reason, O,o w/ ogoneks are found in Latin Extended B, and few fonts seems to include characters from this. I'm not sure whether or not the acute w/ ogonek are in Latin Extended additional, but few fonts have these, either.

If you are making fonts, it is valuable to think in terms of what languages your fonts can cover. Just a few extra glyphs get you Yoruba, transliterated Arabic, transliterated Devanagari & Tamil, and of course, some of the Native American written forms. You need not fill out all of Latin B & Extended additional to pick up the glyphs needed of a number of languages.

For OpenType application, using ccmp is one way to provide for Latin characters with diacriticals not precomposed in Unicode.

But until there is general support for these languages in both ordinary text editors & web fonts, the Native American languages will remain a problem.

The fundamental problem is that there are a *lot* of Latin-based languages which need "just a few extra glyphs."

Personally, I'd think Yoruba and Pilipino/Tagalog would seem to be high on the list for easy languages to cover that are not covered by, say, WGL-4. At least by sheer number of speakers....

		<div class="commentbody">It's all relative, but neither combining combining diacritics nor o-ogoneks seem terribly rare to me.  My OS X comes with about a dozen fonts that contain the latter.  I wonder what the comparable figure is for Vista? 

Since the characters with ogonek plus acute are never going to be in Unicode in precomposed form,  the quality of their display will inevitably depend on the smarts of the local software.  As pointed out, having both a dot and an acute on an i is not at all good.  A work-around for this with some fonts may be to encode the character as i-acute plus combining ogonek rather than vice-versa.

But no doubt a font designed specifically to display these things perfectly is the best solution. I'd welcome a chance to test Paul's font with my Navajo keyboard layouts when it is available.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Greetings, all: This is Barbara Williams, spouse of Charles E, who's allowing me a brief post under his log-in.

We considered using Plantagenet, but in the end chose Laser Cherokee, in part due to some variant forms in Plantagenet that traditionalists were not comfortable with. Feel free to write to me directly about this: As I understand matters, the glyphs in the "official" syllabary are under some review right now, in part due to discovery of some documents dating from the time of Sequoia.

Indeed.
FYI, Zapf's design is like that. Which is not really surprising,
considering Zapf has lauded Van Krimpen's jingoistic Greek fonts.

Although there are three bands (three separate nations or governments) we are all the same people of the same blood. Of the three, the Keetoowahs are the more traditional band. More of our people speak, read and write our language. In fact, I'm a teacher of our language among other things. The Eastern Band, those around Cherokee, NC, speak a little differently than those who live in the west but we can still understand one another. In all three Bands, we have instituted programs and cultural camps to teach our youth the traditions, culture and language. We don't use the word preserve when we refer to our customs and traditions. We rather use perpetuate. In the shadow of main stream society, we are fighting hard to keep our traditions in tact and ongoing. Unfortunately, we are very aware of losing our identity which is why we incorporated these programs and other courses of action to teach the youth the various facets of our ways of life.

As I mentioned: I'm a teacher of our language but I am also a member of the Seven Clans of the Fire Camp Committee and a founding member of the Turtle Island Liars Club. As a teacher, I hold classes in the community on speaking, reading and writing our language (using the current version of the syllabary). Other teachers have classes in the public school system while others hold classes at some of the universities in Northeastern Oklahoma. Seven Clans of the Fire holds three camps a year to teach the crafts, traditions and customs of our people to the youth and anyone else who wants to learn the real culture of the Cherokee people. The Turtle Island Liars Club in a loose association of traditional storytellers of the Keetoowah and Cherokee people. We hold storytelling nights every few months to pass on the stories of our people.

It's the same with us Armenians (even though your genocide was even worse than ours) since more than 60% of our population lives outside Armenia. It's a struggle ingrained.

--

As I've stated in lectures and articles, a script can either serve to perpetuate a culture or it can serve to assimilate it, the latter if it slowly becomes transformed* to resemble the dominant mainstream culture. This has been happening to many alphabets (not least Armenian for one) and I call it Latinization. And just like perpetuating spoken language we need to worry about perpetuating written language.

* Or sometimes if it's created to be like that; see Vietnamese, the Carmen Miranda of writing systems.

It seems to me that there's a case to be made for breaking with the Zapf-style Latinized Cherokee, and either reverting to the original form you mention (which I would be very interested to see, especially in a side-by-side comparison with the current form) or making something from scratch, or something in between.

The first is a sample of the Cherokee syllabary, showing the handwritten forms followed by an early draft of the more familiar typeset forms. They are written in pairs, divided by a vertical zigzag bar.

It is quite sad that the handwritten script is largely unknown today. It is quite beautiful. It would be nice to see it in a longer text as opposed to this letter-by-letter display.

		<div class="commentbody">re: American Indian / Native American language fonts

I have a couple of pan-American typefaces in production at the moment which aim to support all North American (along with most European) languages: Huronia and Plantagenet Novus. I can not say when either will be publicly released, as development on these is slower then I should like, as they have no specific financial backing. A basic beta specimen for Huronia can be found by following the beta link on tiro.com/fonts. In developing these, I am also working on a character/glyph set specification which will be released in some form at the same time as the font(s).

As far as the Cherokee script is concerned, it is a bit too complicated to jam into a single post all the issues, but it is an interesting typographic challenge. There are many presumptions from within and without regarding reader's expectations. The 'original' cursive form would be interesting to approach as a design issue, but before engaging in that experiment I am unconvinced that it would work as a fully functional script. Not only are there probable issues in how it would work technically, there is also the issue of how easy it would be to learn. These perceived problems are no doubt behind the development of the second model, which more closely resembles European typefaces and the further development by Worcester for it’s adaptation to metal type. There were obviously various technical and cultural motivations that existed in the mid-19th century which determined how Sequoyah's writing system developed and mutated and for the most part the design decisions were fairly sound at the time.

Present-day expectations and presumptions about what is, or is not authentic is quite another matter and has given rise to some odd results. My own preliminary attempts at designing Cherokee fonts has been informed by the original (metal) typefaces, and to some extent the earlier cursive model. I don't pretend that the first version (as comes with OSX) is exactly as I would like it, and I continue to develop it and other Cherokee fonts—however what I, as a type designer see as a rational process and result may not always meet the expectations of the users of the language, as other interpretations that proliferate weren't produced using the same rationale. I am writing an article on this, but like so many things it is not complete yet so I don't want to post a link here yet. If anyone is interested, they can contact me directly: ross {at} tiro {dot} com

		<div class="commentbody">The script shown in the pic is what Sequoyah came up with but was changed, as I mentioned, to accommodate creating typesets for a printing press. I, for one, have noticed trouble from modern students in learning the syllabary the way it is now. It takes extra effort for them to disregard their mind set in seeing some of the symbols as letters of the alphabet. They see D as 'dee' instead of 'aw' and so on. I've always felt it would have been easier to learn the original than what was developed for the press.

Also, the numbers system wasn't adopted by the Cherokee Nation. They felt the roman numbers were good enough. Again, I wish we would use the numbering system.

The current writing system has been used over the years. I'm often asked to translate letters and note books written in the syllabary. Mostly it was used to write down arcane medicine used by our medicine people. But, of course, we have the New Testament and some of the Old written in the syllabary. Hymns are written down too. So the writing system is used to this day.

One last thing for now.

What Sequoyah came up with still isn't the original writing system. There was a priest clan that was killed off that had a writing system. We have an old legend that mentions we had a writing system thousands of years ago.</div>

This is exactly the problem even in major scripts like Cyrillic.
Cyrillic for example was <em>formally</em> Latinized three centuries
ago by Peter the Great; now, especially if a Cyrillic snippet is
interjected in English text (or vice versa), the reader will get
thrown off. The attenuating factor there is that the Russians
are not an endagered culture, so it's not a huge deal.

		<div class="commentbody">Although I could read each example of the Cherokee Syllabary easily, I kind of liked the Agamemnon type a little bit better because of its unique designs of some of the symbols.

In the early ninties, I worked with a man who developed a font for use by the Mac and, as I mentioned in an earlier post, it was very easy to use. One could type in the sounds and it would come up in the syllabary. It was easy to use and quick but it kept some folks from learning to read and write it. It was too easy to use. A person didn't really need to know how to write in Cherokee to type it up on the computer.

I used this font until a few months ago when the program just quit! I do miss it but am now searching for a font that I can use for my classes. Which is how I found this great site and board. (lucky me)</div>

I was revisiting this thread and noticed I had overlooked this wish, realizing I could oblige.

Below is a snippit of text which shows the cursive version of the syllabary underneath the same text in "regular" syllabics (the upper being Huronia).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/huronia_cursive_3611.png]


This is pretty rough, and is just the first step in my analysis of the cursive form for adoption as either an "italic" or perhaps an italic stylistic variant which I am considering working into Huronia. In any case, what is shown is unrefined and quite close to Sequoyah's original, although I've adjusted the nominal baseline a little as well as inter-character fit (neither to any large extent). Needless to say, a typographic interpretation would smooth things out, but this gives a rough idea as to how hand-written manuscript might look using these forms of the syllables.

		<div class="commentbody">Further South, but still native Americans Tzeltal and Tzotzil Mayan languages use Latin based systems as there was no actual written form until mid 20 century.

A long time ago while helping with a educational project in the mountains of southern Mexico I did this as an experiment, maybe the interesting thing is the idea use of a modified ' to indicate inspired vocals very common in Tzeltal, and the use of a K instead of a Q which is not used in Tzeltal but usually appear in texts.

The dingbats are based in children drawings. It was very usual to have soldiers, helicopters and bombs drawn at art class.

The font was called Tzeltal Kop or True Word

I'd like to do more research and learn more on this.

I see some really basic skeletal letterforms from what Ross Mills post (thanks!) but can anyone point me to sort of extremely basic and fundamental construction? I mean like a subtraction of style and character. All the samples and specimens I can find have a high contrast style, distinct style, kind of all looking very similar.

		<div class="commentbody">ᎣᏏᏲ ᏂᎦᏓ, (hello everyone) Thanks for all the interest.... a lot being said in this line of discussion.  As Font makers you have noticed that much of what we use today, as a designed font, is pretty bad when it comes to some of the very rough looking uneven font designs.  It is a very complex issue when it comes to the Cherokee orthography in the community. Cherokees take great pride in our writing system.  It is true that many in the eastern band of Cherokees do not read and write cherokee but some do. And it is also true that at one time some people at the museum over there proposed the idea of changing our syllabary writing system in to a alphabet. This was quickly dismissed and did not go over very well and we should just leave it at that. Many more people here in Oklahoma Cherokee Nation and United Keetoowah Band read and write in Cherokee.  Roy Boney and I were very honored to speak to so many font designers that work on so many languages.  Roy and I worked with many advanced speakers from our community and that work at CHerokee Nation to find out what advanced speakers look for in a writing system for each character.  We developed a very thin font that was made in fontlab. It is not really that professionally made but it has many needed things in it. Most languages around the world have font styles for many different needs, printed type, signs, web, fun, ads and so on as you all know. but we do not have this for our own language at this time, when we need it the most.  Many in the community do not question why we dont have more fonts. In fact many get defensive when we first talk about new fonts a few years ago thinking we where trying to change the language or proposing something like what the museum over and eastern band wanted.  Roy and I believe that if we are going to continue to have a language for our community it must have all the power and strength that different fonts can offer.. We started realizing we needed to be on the computers and cell phones then after we got on that we realized that we needed more fonts.  This idea is starting to be understood by some of our elders when we start to show them why we want to do this or have it done.  It is always important to work with the community that reads and writes the language that you are designing for.  Most languages have enough material out there so that that is not needed but in smaller language groups it is important to talk to people before starting your design work.   Much of the problems with the present fonts is that people did not at least have the community it was made for, have look at it, before the release.  The Cherokee Type face was made for a printing press and all of our fonts still look like they are for that same purpose.  Sequoyah in his time wrote with print from the style influenced from the printing press also, even after he made the cursive style too.  His main reason was to create a writing system that would allow his people to communicate in written form.  If he was round today, I believe he would be designing fonts and having others to design some for all these technologies that are constantly coming out (and have different requirements) for Cherokee people to use and communicate with each other.  So if anyone needs more information about cherokee handwriting for fonts feel free to email me.  We have collected handwriting samples and old documents that might help a font designer with the information they are looking for.  joseph-erb@cherokee.org

		<div class="commentbody">Joseph, is it possible for you to post a link to the 'very thin font' that you have made, or at least to a PDF of it, so that this can serve as a guide to type designers thinking about new styles? One of the things that is frequently a problem for designers encountering a new script is discerning which features are essential to the identity of a sign and which are particular to individual styles.

With regard to feedback from the community, I think my own approach -- if I ever find time to work on my ideas for a Cherokee type -- would be to make a set of representative glyphs covering, say, ten syllables, demonstrating the principal characteristics of the style, then seek feedback on these. I presume you would be able to facilitate this sort of review by members of the community (elders, of course, but also those who are most likely to use the new styles of type).</div>

We looked at hand writing and tried to get a thinner more balanced look and roy did most of the tech work on this.  This is just a sample and not cleaned up but it might help some out there have another thing to reference. It is strange still for most elders to see a font that changed so much compared to the type face we have had for almost two hundred years.  but we are trying to make the language work better for the youth and the future.</div>

I'd be interested to see some samples of handwriting in Cherokee. I've thought about playing with a script font for Cherokee, but, in all honesty, I have no idea what the glyphs would look like.

And aside from Cherokee, what about expanding fonts to include the diacritics regularly used in Lakota? Letters like ŋ or ȟ have very poor support, I've seen books restricted to using TNR because it was the only font that had enough character support. No one should be forced to use TNR, heavens.</div>

Now, with Adobe fonts anyway, anyone can pretty easily modify a font to include all the Lakota characters. I've done this for a couple, including Minion. The problem is you cannot *distribute* those fonts -- but you can certainly make them up for your own use.</div>

<cite>Is that a bit clearer?</cite>

Not really. Let's take a situation that is very, very close to factual. There are about 100 AAUP presses. I'd guess that at least 50 of them use InDesign, and have more or less stayed current with the various releases. Therefore, in spite of the human tendency to improve the facts, I can be pretty certain all those presses have at least one licensed copy of Minion. Moreover, many of them know we've "modified" Minion's character complement over the years, in order to set to set transliterated Arabic, Indic Scripts, Navaho, Lakota, etc.

They have licenses, we have a license. In response to requests for our fonts, I've always said, "I'm sorry, the Adobe license prohibits it."

This on the basis of anther part of the FAQ:

<cite>A consultant may solicit their services to companies who have legitimately licensed copies of Adobe font software. The work product of the consultant must remain with the company. The consultant cannot (i) take or keep a copy of the company’s original, localized, or customized version of the font software, or (ii) distribute any original, localized or customized versions of the font software.</cite>

It gets down to what "distribute" means. I could furnish the those 50 AAUP presses with the modified Minion if I physically go to their place of business, take nothing with me (strip searched at the door? MRI to make sure I hadn't swallowed a flash drive?), do the work, then take nothing with me as I leave (more searches & radiation from another MRI?) But to send them a copy as an email attachment is prohibited.

That about right?

Does it make sense to your lawyers?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles, I think you're looking at it the wrong way. Think of it this way:

Adobe allows one to modify their Adobe-licensed font, but not distribute it. The modified font is for private use. Adobe, however, recognizes that this private use is often what we call "internal business use." Furthermore, any individual person or business might need to hire an expert to do these modifications, but that is work for hire.

The problem with the scenario you describe above is that you essentially have the font and are distributing it. Place A needs the font, so you go give it to them; Place B needs the font, so you go give it to them. Places A and B might have their own licenses, but the modified font needs to originate and stay with a single person or business. It can't originate with you and then be distributed to multiple people or businesses.

Here's the bottom line. Most foundries do not allow font modifications, but Adobe has tried to distinguish itself by allowing it, <em>with restrictions.</em> We don't want modified fonts to be distributed or become new "products" so we've chosen to draw the line here.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Christopher,

It seems to me I'm looking at it exactly the right way. The font software cannot be distributed, but the work (through a hired consultant) can be be distributed -- done at any location on a properly licensed font. So, taking no software, I could flit about the country, modifying Minion for people. Hopefully the strip searches would not be needed -- I'm an old man, it would be ugly.

Suppose we take the airplane out of it. I, as a hired consultant, from my console, can log onto the client's computer and open up their copy of Minion in my font editing program. I make the needed modifications, then save the files only on their hard drive.

But I cannot (and BTW, I have not) been sending people a copy. Forgive me, but does no one else find this ludicrous?   </div>

Yes. 

BTW, several other foundries allow modification, you just have to receive permission first. But all of them like Adobe, prohibit distributing the modified fonts.

And while I laud Adobe's policy on letting people modify fonts for their own use, between the peculiarities of *publishing* font software, and the differences between digital and print editions facing book publishers, open source fonts are becoming more and more attractive to me. Not to "me" as a typesetter -- we get a competitive advantage from having fonts other people don't/can't have -- but as I think about the industry I'm in, and its future.

		<div class="commentbody">I think one key point of the discussion about modifying Adobe fonts hinges on the meaning of the word "distribute." In this case it's a legal sense of the word, and might be subject to debate.

One might argue that overall it would be in Adobe's interest to allow the kind of distribution that Charles is doing. But then again, if Adobe were to add such characters themselves in the future, they might not like such pre-modified versions being too widespread.  :/

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Thomas -- I'd say yes, and no. To take a somewhat longer view, I think we an assume Unicode will be around for a while. Longer than OpenType, and certainly longer than InDesign. Those of us with thining, graying hair remember the rush to archive jobs in Quark -- this after the rush to archive jobs in "Compugraphic." Etc.

Now, making up the characters is usually trivial. Most are a Latin character plus one or more combining diacriticals. (Of course, it would help if Adobe & other font publishers would include the Unicode combining diacriticals in their font, but as the barman in <cite>Irma La Duce</cite> said, "That's another story.") 

The problem is how perfectly correct Unicode can occur in a manuscript. A character can be formed in any number of ways. We have a few manuscripts come in where even "aacute" is formed (typed) by the string "a" plus the "acute combining" diacritical. We get around such issues by having a "manuscript cleanup stage," and our rule is that all constructions that have a Unicode number assigned are converted to that, and all that don't are broken down into their components. We don't allow, for example, eacute with a macron below, we ensure the string is e, plus macron below, plus acute. (& remember that while the ordering of accents within a plane is specified by Unicode, the order of the planes is not. Yet one more issue). For such with no single Unicode point, I make them up & write (usually, add to) a ccmp feature.

Now think of the problem a font publisher faces. They usually feel they can't make such assumptions, and have to support any of the several ways such characters can occur. Anybody unconvinced take a look at SIL's ccmp & mark/mkmk features for a font like Charis. It is no wonder that this kind of support is lacking.

It is part of a larger issue, font publishers don't view book publishers as a significant market, so they don't address the workflows book publishers need. Take a look, for example, at Biblovault or codeMantra. People who archive books, and make other products from the "print" book file, for the original publisher. Even a site license for fonts -- expensive -- makes the use of such companies technically illegal. Best I can tell, you can't get a site license that covers multiple businesses. Not from Adobe, anyway.

So we're left with "don't ask, don't tell," except there is no way to make the products without telling. I guess it is "don't ask," and since we have to tell, don't even look.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems to me that there is a real difference between

a) modifying an Adobe font and advertising the fact that you have done so and offering to make the modified font available -- whether for free or for a price -- to other licensees of the original Adobe font;

and

b) modifying an Adobe font for your own purposes or the purposes of a client and also providing that font to other clients who seek the same modifications.

That is, there seems to be a difference between being in the business of distributing modified fonts and being in the business of providing modified fonts to people who commission them. One way in which I always seek to conform with Adobe's license terms in this respect is to personalise the modified fonts for the individual client, even if the same set of modifications to character set, etc. apply (although, off hand, I'm having trouble thinking of a situation in which more than one client wanted exactly the same set of modifications).</div>

Which takes us back to the topic and fonts that support Native American languages. I've had a number of clients who want the same thing, as long as they're setting Navajo, or Lakota, or Kiowa, etc.</div>

Apparently a decade or so after the metal type was introduced the design of a few of the characters changed. Plantagenet originally contained the original forms, but was later revised to reflect the revised character shapes. I believe the windows 8 version of Plantagenet contains the older forms as stylistic alternates.
