    is usable, and I approve of calligraphic faces also.

    a most worthy exploration. \r\nWhen making kinship of Sans and Serif, why not
    making kinship of Serif and Fraktur?\r\nThe game may well get played further.
    Have we seen a superfamily Fraktur-serif/Fraktur-Sans?\r\n\r\nIn the old days,
    using Roman inside Fraktur for emphasizing (or vice versa?) was common practice."

  body: "Nick, I'm not claiming that Nowak can be credited with inventing the idea
    of using non-Italic styles for emphasis*, and for all we know that wasn't even
    her intent (noting that the Roman was not released concurrently with the Fraktur**).
    However there's a difference between designing different cuts under a single umbrella
    that can be intermixed, versus simply getting lucky mixing totally unrelated fonts
    without ruining readability. Look at the famous works of Avital Ronell for example:
    inventive, expressive, but not highly readable. This is a different animal, and
    quite a rara avis - in fact I only know of one single very good example \"on the
    ground\":\r\nhttp://www.daidala.com/intlife.html\r\n\r\n* Even when I made the
    Daam Entity over a decade ago I doubt I was the first.\r\n\r\n** Which however
    could have been an Excoffon-style cleverness (where he released the Nord weight
    of Olive first, in order to get attention, even though it was less versatile than
    the other weights to follow).\r\n\r\nComparing it to something like Sense and
    Sensibility (great name BTW) I have to wonder if those two can effectively serve
    as emphasis for each other; I think they're just too close - and the same goes
    even for virtually any Serif-Sans system. Also note how unworkable upright Italics
    are for emphasis.\r\n\r\nAs an aside I personally don't mind it when Nick cites
    his own work; it must be admitted (and I've said this before) that he's one of
    our most innovative designers (of which there's been a shortage lately).\r\n\r\nBTW,
    one other way Eskapade is innovative is -what I consider to be- a classy implementation
    of rotalics (see the second half of http://typographica.org/on-typography/a-fruitful-discomfort-the-face-of-the-2012-olympics/).
    In fact it would have been nice if the Roman also had a rotalic-style Italic,
    at least as an alternative cut.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the proportions are so similar you hardly notice the change, which is quite strange.
    What's more interesting about these is they were made by different people.

  body: "It is true that using Roman inside Fraktur, or vice versa, was a relatively
    common practice in the really old days; sometimes later on, sans and Roman were
    used that way too, although, as noted, a visible difference in weight was usually
    needed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Roman/Fraktur case was initially used as we would use
    italics today, later on Fraktur or sans-serif tended to be used as an alternative
    to bold, as opposed to either a replacement for italics, or a third level of emphasis
    beyond bold, IIRC. This could have been because many typefaces had a complementary
    italic, but no boldface.\r\n\r\nI don't think this really counts as an example
    of the same phenomenon, but an even more common response to the lack of a boldface
    in a Roman font is to use a Clarendon as the bold - this was done in many Linotype
    layouts."

  body: "Clarendon was the original bold for Roman text, when Scotch was the style.
    High contrast bolds were a later development.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I originally
    provided a conventional, high contrast bold for the <em>Globe and Mail</em> serif
    faces in 2006. Then, when I extended the family in 2009, I added a heavy slab
    for display, because it\u2019s a contemporary look; as an afterthought, I wondered
    what an interpolation of that and the Regular serif style would look like\u2014it
    turned out nicely, and this slab bold has become used by the paper\u2019s designers
    more than the high contrast bold, they especially like it for Bold contrast in
    body text.\r\n\r\nSo, just as one may have two italics for a roman (italic and
    slanted), one may have two bolds (slab and contrasty). It\u2019s a problem for
    style-linking and layout apps, which are predicated on only one of each.\r\n"

  body: "Leda does a really good job matching the roman and fraktur structurally.
    Is there a regular weight? I guess there's not. I could really see it working,
    not only as a display face, but also on running text.\r\n\r\nThe question is how
    this new fraktur instance would interact with the roman and italic (if I may anticipate
    such triad will ever be used together). I have a feeling that it has been mostly
    assumed fraktur will serve as an alternative to italic. There's also a natural
    temptation to use both. We would have two emphasizers, italic and fraktur, in
    the same block of text (and bold as an intensifier). Using both, italic and fraktur
    seems just unnecessary. The problem here is to find a <em>reason</em> for the
    fraktur, which I think is the most interesting question.\r\n\r\nThe question is
    not whether Eskapade or Leda are innovative, they are <em>a priori</em>. Nor whether
    fraktur is usable nowadays. I truly believe that is a customary matter. If someone
    can read it, it can be read and adopted by everyone. John already indirectly pointed
    it out. The question is how can this roman-italic-bold-fraktur tetrad (or three
    of them) be used meaningfully together. Fraktur could be used instead of bold
    italic, for example.\r\n\r\nIf think it would be incredible if it was possible,
    for once, to break the roman-italic marriage, and combine faces in a much more
    freely way. What Nick tells about style-pairing, it's just... goose bumps."

  body: "<blockquote>to find a reason for the fraktur</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    it has to make sense as a particular \"voice\". In a way that Italic -which connotes
    among other things informality, ironically not what emphasis is about- so often
    fails at. This can be the case simply due to the way it looks, or preferably due
    to its cultural connotations - for example to set passages about Germany, or gangs,
    or Picasso, or...\r\n\r\nI would again point to the sample from the otherwise
    unassuming novel \"The Interior Life\"* where the Modern face is used for passages
    about the heroine's suburban life while the \"fauve humanist\" face is used for
    passages about her medieval fantasy life. And then there's the Italic too!\r\n\r\n*
