body: 'I''ve been generating some fonts lately and it finally occurred to me to wonder:
  When I generate, why does FontLab insist on making a font file that''s complete
  with every character in Unicode? (That is, when I view it in Windows'' Character
  Map, the font shows a character for every Unicode glyph, including everything in
  Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, plus lots of obscure Asian writing systems.) Is there
  some sort of option that I could tick so it would only generate the characters that
  actually exist in my font? Or do these characters somehow not really exist? When
  I run fontplot in AFDKO, it only plots the ones that I''ve actually designed.'

  body: FontLab is not doing this. Windows Character Map makes use of default font
    fallback to display Unicode characters that are outside the scope of the individual
    font.

  body: Huh. So why doesn't it do it with some of my other fonts? It doesn't seem
    to have anything to do with otf vs. ttf. Verdana (otf) shows only characters in
    Verdana, but the Walleye otf that I generate is filled with default characters.
    What controls it?

  body: "I wish I knew. Character Map displays differing sets of  characters for various
    fonts, and I've never figured out the pattern.\r\n\r\nBut trust me: those glyphs
    are not in your font. If you don't believe me, just re-import the font into FontLab
    and see what it actually contains."

  body: Weird. Well, at least now I know that there's no giant load of extraneous
    data in my files. Thanks!
