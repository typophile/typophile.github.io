  even if placed at full x/y values. Seems like the only Illustrator versions that
  shows pixel fonts the crispy way are Illustrator 10 and below. (I wrote to Adobe
  about it last year [2007, or even 2006], and I still didn\u2019t get an answer [surprise!].)\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know the trick for crispy looking pixel fonts in any of the CS versions?
  I\u2019d like to design my Websites in Illustrator CS... I\u2019m done with 10!\r\n\r\nThanks."

    isn''t based on pixels, so how should the pixel fonts be rendered in a good quality?
    You need an app that is based on a pixel grid and you need to set the view to
    100% (1 pixel on the screens equals 1 pixel of your design).  '

  body: "Yes. Thank you: I design my Flash Websites at 100%.\r\n\r\nI've been working
    with Illustrator 10 to design my Flash Websites for five years. (Designing a Flash
    Website in Photoshop is completely inappropriate knowing that Flash is vector-based.)\r\n\r\nBut
    it's frustrating to witness that Flash fonts have always looked great in the previous
    versions of Illustrator (10 and below), but not in the actual CS versions.\r\n\r\nThis
    means I'll eventually have to design directly in Flash, but I'm so much more comfortable
    designing in Illustrator!\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm trying to know if anyone is aware
    of the following:\r\n\r\n1) How to make Flash fonts look good in the CS versions
    of Illustrator;\r\n2) If this is not possible, WHY did Illustrator change that?
    I'm sure I'm not the only one cursing.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    just while you are in Illustrator itself, correct?\r\n\r\nI suspect it has something
    to do with a change to the rendering engine. I wonder if they could give you a
    choice about that like they do in photoshop. Actually I should check to see if
    there is one..."

    \ But like I said: this will only give you a nice looking pixel font if the grid
    of the font and the grid of the Illustrator view will match coincidentally. \r\nIf
    you just do your layout in Illustrator and then move it to Flash, why do you care
    about the appearance of the fonts in Illustrator?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    This will stop the \u201Cblurring\u201D.</em>\r\n- - This will make all of the
    other items on the artboard aliased as well.\r\n\r\n<em>If you just do your layout
    in Illustrator and then move it to Flash, why do you care about the appearance
    of the fonts in Illustrator?</em>\r\n- - Because the look and feel isn't the same
    at all. Therefore, the design process isn't the same, and the presentation process
    isn't the same either...\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "You can save a little time by saving the effect as a graphic style, which
    is very simple to do: Select one of your already-rasterized text boxes and drag
    it to the graphic styles palette. This will create a blank white icon in the graphic
    styles palette. When you select a text box and click on the icon, the same rasterize
    effect settings will be applied. Since a blank white icon is not very identifiable,
    it helps to give it a name (double click on it) and set the graphic styles palette
    to one of the list views.\r\n"

    to design with. I don't want to waste too much time having to get used to Flash's
    tools. I work on a MAC, and my programmer works on a PC. So I have to break apart
    the fonts anyway when I give him the Flash docs. (Please don't ask anymore questions
    relating to our/my method of work... It would be too long and not on the subject.
    Thanks. We all have our own ways of working for a lot of different reasons. That's
    it, that's all.)\r\n\r\nIllustrator is vector-based, and so is Flash. I think
    it's logical.\r\n\r\nWhat wouldn't be logical, would be to design the interior
    of a novel with Photoshop for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThanks."
