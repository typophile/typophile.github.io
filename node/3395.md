body: I&#39;m looking for a better way to remove node overlap, or more specifically,
  two nodes occupying the same coordinate. <BR> <BR>I remember reading something about
  fontlab 4.5 introducing a tool that would remove node overlap by, presumably, expanding
  the outline of the font by a tiny increment and then merging the contours again.
  <BR> <BR>Is this feature or something like it unique to the python scripts? If so,
  I&#39;ve got an afternoon of troubleshooting ahead, trying to get python to run
  on my mac. <BR> <BR>If there is any way to achieve the same thing natively in the
  software, it would be great. <BR> <BR>From this... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/27605.gif"

  body: You can simply use Tools / Transform / Effects / Bold and set the weight to
    1 unit. Then remove overlaps.  <BR> <BR>Adam
