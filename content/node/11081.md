  body: This reminds me of those huge platform boots! <BR> <BR>Some of the letters
    &#40;like the &#34;B&#34;&#41; show a lot of promise - they can lead the rest
    to a nice complete whole. But I don&#39;t like those &#34;vents&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Hrant, <BR> <BR>so do you think that I should remove the vents?  <BR>I like
    the B also, I guess that my favorite letters are those with counters.  I had a
    tough time unifying the letters that have counters with the letters without.  do
    you have any suggestions? <BR> <BR>kelly  '
