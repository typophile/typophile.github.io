body: endashes and emdashes. They&#39;re different from hyphens - thanks to my many
  lecturers for NEVER pointing this out - this I know. Now that I know, hyphens just
  don&#39;t look right some places. Problem is I&#39;m not entirely sure where to
  use them, so whats the protocall? <BR> <BR>And while we&#39;re at it, how do I access
  them in Quark &#40;I can get the code for them from fontographer but don&#39;t know
  how to specify this in Quark&#41;?

  body: 'On a Mac, Alt is also often referred to as Option. <BR> <BR>The proper use
    of hyphen, en, and em dashes is also frequently covered by editorial style guides,
    since the various dashes serve different semantic purposes. <i>Chicago Manual
    of Style</i> is a good reference, in addition to Bringhurst. <BR> <BR>In short:  <BR>
    <BR>Hyphens are used for hyphenating words, either because they are spelled as
    hyphenated compounds or because of end-of-line hyphenation.  <BR> <BR>En dashes
    are used for ranges of numerals. There are also special circumstances for using
    an en dash in certain hyphenated compounds, but editorial style guides differ
    on this. <BR> <BR>Em dashes are used for parenthetical statements. These are the
    dashes that are often represented as double hyphens in text -- such as I&#39;m
    doing here -- and usually indicate a change in voice or a subordinate clause with
    a relatively looser relationship to the main statement. Style guides &#40;editorial
    and typographic&#41; differ on whether em dashes should be set on either side
    with full spaces, thin spaces, or set closed. <BR> <BR>HTH <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> BTW I believe the person who originally explained it to
    me was German as well, when I did my training at MetaDesign Berlin. It might even
    have been Herr Spiekermann himself. <BR> <BR>The problem I have with the American
    way of using Em-dashes for parenthetical statements is that it creates humongous
    gaps in your lines of text. It <i>can</i> look beautiful in book settings or in
    two column magazine lay-out, even quite elegant, but you simply can&#39;t get
    away with it when your columns of text get narrower. It also gets a bit awkward
    when the dash almost literally sticks to the neighbouring words.

    and an em-dash -- about a third of a space, so it&#39;s not too close and not
    too far.</i> <BR> <BR>Cheshire, perhaps you&#39;ve got a script to do all that
    manual kerning for you, but here&#39;s an alternative approach that I use.  <BR>
    <BR>In Quark, I set all my em dashes with a &#34;flexible&#34; space on either
    side -- <b>shift-opt-space</b>. Quark doesn&#39;t have access to a thin space,
    per se; but you can set the value of the flexible space in the Document Preferences
    &#62; Character tab. The specification is a percentage of the width of the normal
    space. I like to use 25%, which generally yields approximately a 16th em space.
    <BR> <BR>You can do this with a global search-and-replace. I usually replace all
    em-dashes with the string <b>&#92;f&#151;&#92;f</b>. &#40;That should read <i>backslash
    f emdash backslash f</i>&#41;. The &#92;f &#40;<i>backslash f</i>&#41; is Quark
    code for the flexible space. Then I follow up with a search for the [space][flexible
    space] combination and replace with just the flexible space, and the same for
    the reverse, to catch any double spaces fore and aft. <BR> <BR>You can add the
    command key &#40;command-shift-opt-space&#41; to make the flexible space non-breaking,
    if you need to &#40;to prevent a line from breaking before the dash, for instance&#41;,
    although you can only do this manually, as far as I&#39;ve discovered. <BR> <BR>If
    the em dash in a font is too long for your taste, but the en dash too short, you
    can create your own &#34;three-quarter&#34; em dash by horizontally scaling the
    em dash 80% or so. In this case, the scaling does no damage to the integrity of
    the character shape. You can define a character style specifically for applying
    this to your em dashes and do a search-and-replace, unchecking the Ignore Attributes
    box and applying your character style. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'
