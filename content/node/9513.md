  for getting rid of duplicated nodes in Fontlab. example: <BR>I&#39;m creating a
  pixelfont in Illustrator. I group the pixels to one path. Then i do object/path/simplify
  &#40;option straight lines 90'

  body: Gilles,  <BR> <BR>1. If you&#39;re in a Glyph Window and enable View / Show
    Layer / FontAudit, you will see various outline problems including empty lines
    &#40;i.e. duplicated nodes&#41;. You can click on the red arrows and choose &#34;Fix&#34;
    or &#34;Fix All&#34;.  <BR> <BR>2. If you&#39;re in the Font Window, you can select
    all glyphs &#40;Edit / Select All&#41; and use Tools / Outline / Optimize, which
    will remove the duplicated nodes as well. You can run it 2 or 3 times to make
    sure it got rid of all the problems.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab

  body: 'Wow now thats a fast and good news! <BR>Can&#39;t wait tomorrow to try.Thanks
    a lot! <BR> <BR>By the way, another thing i recently observed is when copy/pasting
    caracters from illu to fontlab they sometimes change size compared to the ones
    i pasted another day &#40;like a pixel higher for ex&#41;. I really carefully
    compared the size in illu, they have exactly the same height as the one i already
    pasted some days ago so they are at the good size when copying, and then when
    pasting them into fontlab they seem to &#34;grow&#34;  a tiny bit. <BR>Here&#39;s
    a concrete example: <BR>I did the lowercase &#34;a&#34; a week ago. Today i create
    an &#34;'
