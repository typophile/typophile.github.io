  body: "Connect is heavily customized, and could be a one-off. Modifying this typeface
    gets you close:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/campton/\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure Emann is:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/info-text-pro/regular/\r\n\r\nPresto
    is a bit more difficult. The following is close, but not quite:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typolar/vinkel/regular/\r\n\r\nThere
    are dozens of sans serif faces with the same general shape, but the kicker with
    Presto is the r and how straight the ear on it is."
