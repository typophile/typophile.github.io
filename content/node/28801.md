    you can find old issues of Critique magazine, I always thought the writing was
    very good.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.graphis.com/journals/index.php\">Graphis</a>
    isn't what it used to be, but still worth a poke through at the bookstore.\r\n\r\nYou
    should also consider the online forums/blogs that are populated and written by
    well-published authors. Specifically I'm thinking about <a href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/\">Design
    Observer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/\">Speak
    Up</a>."

    Publishing Company</a> has very well written journals that would apply.

  body: "Eye is probably still the best thing out there in the way of a general survey
    of graphic design in my opinion. It's a pity that it costs so much, but that's
    one of the results of not flooding the inside with advertising.\r\n\r\nBaseline
    is excellent for typography:\r\nhttp://www.baselinemagazine.com/"
