body: "I'm curious if anyone can identify this face for me. After doing some searching
  I realized that it is neither Bodoni or Annlie Extra Bold (as what has been previously
  suggested). My typographic vernacular is quite limited but what strikes me is the
  \"condension\" of the lowercase \"r\" and the \"narrows\" at the top and tail of
  the lowercase \"t\".\r\n\r\nCan someone help? : ) "
