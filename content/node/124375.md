  body: "Hard to tell what it is. Commemoration of teachers at a school, military
    commanders, progress of industry... ?\r\nI agree that the greytone textures do
    indeed look like the image is hand rendered. It could have been created from scratch
    as a drawing, or it could have been a rendering based on a photograph -- which
    was often used in the era when the half tone process of reproducing photographs
    produced very results with very poor contrast control. A halftone of a drawing
    -- as this seems to be -- was an improvement.\r\nWhat ever it is, some idea of
    date and nation would be helpful.\r\nDon"
