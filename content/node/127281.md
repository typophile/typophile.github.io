  question would fit better than in \"general discussions\".\r\nI have another \"random\"
  bug in FontLab i don't know how to deal with: I drew a font with 2 axes (4 masters)
  and before generating want to flatten all glyphs (means \"merge contours\"). But
  if i do so, the merged contour from e.g. master 1 will be applied to all other masters,
  which means i would have to draw these again. Also, this error applies randomly
  to some glyphs who don't even have 2 or more separate forms that could be merged.\r\nIn
  an older project file this all works fine, so i really have no guess what this is
  about \u2014 has anyone of you ever dealt with this bug or some suggestions to fix
  it?\r\nThanks in advance and have a nice sunday!"

  body: "So, the short answer is, that won't work very well, for exactly the reason
    you describe. It's not a bug, it has to do with how MM fonts work. (FontLab VI
    deals with this a bit differently, but still, not something you want to do, normally/)\r\nThere
    are two possible answers:\r\n- if you are going to make separate fonts, then remove
    overlap as part of your font-output routine AFTER you generate the instances.
    Generate instances, then remove overlap. \r\n- if your ultimate output is variable
    fonts, then don't remove overlap. That's the whole reason variable fonts allow
    overlapping paths, because the consequences of overlap removal can be really problematic
    for your shapes."

  body: "Hey Thomas,\r\nthank you for your response \u2014 removing overlap in the
    generated instances is a brilliant idea and should work for me!\r\nStill i'm confused
    about the mechanics cause sometimes merging contours in the mm-file worked with
    obtaining all specific master instances. Is there anything besides the official
    manual to get some information about the mm-mechanics?"
