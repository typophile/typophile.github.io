  and Futura, but less mannered and feminine. Something bold, plain and geometric,
  yet distinct. (No trendy bubbles, and no square gridnik) \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  \r\n\r\nAny new, good fonts that might be a little ahead of the trend?\r\n\r\n(It
  is for a big, effective and experienced company that does indoor plumbing for public
  buildings and projects)"
