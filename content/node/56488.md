body: "The Obama administration today made a move to bolster the communications industry
  by establishing a new agency that would report to NEA but have direct interaction
  with the Whitehouse Press Secretary. The new \"Office of Integrated Typography\"
  would be tasked to clean up the now chaotic use of typefaces in the Federal Government
  and create standards that would be followed by all agencies. The Public Printer,
  director of the Government Printing Office (GPO), could not be reached for comment
  but sources close to the Library of Congress (LoC) revealed that Jonathan Hoefler
  was seen leaving a meeting with the heads of GPO, LOC,and  NEA at an undisclosed
  location. Hoefler's firm (Hoefler & Frere-Jones) developed \"Gotham\", the typeface
  used by the Obama campaign in their successful bid for the Whitehouse. \r\nA press
  conference was scheduled to make the announcement but then postponed to allow a
  background check by the IRS. The President had recently suffered a spate of cabinet
  candidates who had undisclosed tax reporting issues. "
