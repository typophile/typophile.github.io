body: What does it mean to register an OpenType feature such as SS01? From the manual
  it seems to mean defining the language range, how do you do this and what happens
  if you don't 'register' it and your only working in a limited range of supported
  languages?

  body: "What manual?\r\n\r\nGenerally, the term \u2018registered\u2019 is used to
    refer to OTL features that are formally part of the feature annex to the OT spec,
    as distinct from private or custom features. But it sounds like you are using
    the term in some other sense."

    so I looked into that\u2026 the manual covers that topic, where it talks about
    the language system\u2026 I don't quite understand it all\u2026 trying to get
    to the bottom of it all."

  body: "What is \"the manual\"? The user manual for FontLab Studio 5? Something else?\r\n\r\nEach
    lookup (~=\"feature\") needs to be associated with a particular language or set
    of languages. That could be 'dflt' (default), but it has to be something. Otherwise
    it will be in the font, but will never be used....\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Yes, the FontLab Studio 5 manual\u2026\r\n\r\nI believe all features are
    set to default\u2026 when I compile and check in Open Type Features in the preview
    pane and select each feature the script is set to latn and language is set to
    DFLT\u2026 I've never had a problem with features working so\u2026 maybe it was
    just a misunderstanding I was thinking I was missing something else regarding
    this issue\u2026"

    you describing a Font Validator report message? Font Validator has not been updated
    recently, so OTL features that were registered in the spec annex after Font Validator
    was made will get this message. My guess is that other test tools will behave
    the same way when encountering layout feature tags that they do not recognise."
