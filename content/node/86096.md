  have the outlines of the existing letters. The letter G is required.\r\nDoes anybody
  have a clue which font it could be, or is it (as I think) handmade, in the thirties
  or about?"

  body: It is very unlikely that metal architectural lettering from the 1930s was
    an enlargement of a particular typeface. It is more likely to have been designed
    based on letters that appeared in lettering manuals of the period. You could research
    period photos of the city and see if the letters also appeared on other buildings,
    all ordered from one supplier.
