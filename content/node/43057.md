body: "Hello guys, Im looking for sugestions on a typeface that would reflect justice
  (law) and order (balance, equilibrium), but with a slightly modern feel to it.\r\nIt'll
  prolly be working next to a crest.\r\nMaybe an humanist face with a slight modern
  feel to it, maybe a serif, who knows.\r\nI'd appreciate any suggestion : )\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDave"

    as you mentioned \u2018balance\u2019 and \u2018humanist face\u2019, [[FF Legato]]
    came to my mind:\r\n\r\n<cite>Its essential attribute is that the black of the
    individual letterforms is made equal in importance to the white inside and between
    the letters.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://typographica.org/000969.php\">Hrant
    Papazian </a>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of balance \u2013 [[Evert Bloemsma]] is also the
    creator of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF+Balance\">FF&nbsp;Balance</a>.\r\n\r\nF"

    All caps?\r\n\r\n<cite>It\u2019ll prolly be working next to a crest.</cite>\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    afraid I don\u2019t understand that. Like a heraldic emblem? How does that look
    like? I doubt Legato is appropriate for a coat of arms \u2013 unless you want
    to go really (post)modern."

  body: "Sure, It's for a logo restyling.\r\nThe original logo was an heraldic sort
    of emblem which Im turning into a simplified crest.\r\nOriginally the type was
    inside the emblem itself. However I'm removing it from the inside and placing
    it next to the crest.\r\nI want to give it a modern look. Not too modern tho.
    \r\n\r\nIts not for a coat of arms : )\r\n\r\nThanks"
