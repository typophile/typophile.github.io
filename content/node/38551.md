  that I should know, but for the life of me I can't be sure.\r\n\r\nI found it in
  a trashy Australian tabloid magazine but I think it's really beautiful.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designedbynicole.com/photofiles/NW-AList.gif|Click

  body: I've been a fan since I read a book set in Fairfield several years ago. Too
    bad the trashy mag doesn't use [[Rudolph Ruzicka|Ruzicka]]'s true italics.

  body: "Hey, that is weird. It looks like some kind of forced oblique, like you get
    in MS Word?\r\n\r\nI was surprised enough as it was, though, to be reading utter
    tripe in a tabloid but being so taken with the typeface. I think it is absolutely
    beautiful to read. Now that I've had a look through the entire family I am even
    more in love."

  body: "The text in that gif is Fairfield Light. Digital Fairfield gets less pretty
    as the stroke weight increases. I have an academic journal that is set in Fairfield
    Medium for the main body text, and it's only so-so on the pretty meter. And yes,
    the italics are bad.\r\n\r\n"
