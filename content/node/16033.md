body: "I work in an in-house studio for an organization that uses a \u2018corporate
  font\u2019 (Azkidenz-Grotesk) for most of its communications, including work that
  comes out of the Design studio (on MACs) and desktop-published stuff from everyone
  else (on PCs). We were experiencing some conflicts with transferring files from
  PC to MAC, which as far as I\u2019m aware were due to the individual font files
  being named differently between the two font formats. It is our IT department that
  is dealing with the font reseller in this case, but I\u2019m not sure that they
  have the best knowledge at their disposal regarding the issues involved, so I\u2019d
  like some input from anyone out there\u2026\r\n\r\nThe solution from IT was to replace
  all the MAC fonts, which were previously Type1 Postscript, with TrueType versions.
  This caused some hiccups in our Postscript workflow, especially in relation to creating
  PDFs for approvals and for output. Another issue is that the TrueType ones appear
  in the font list as individual fonts, rather than faces within a family, a workflow
  problem for us when typesetting large amounts of text and converting from one font
  to another without loss of formatting.\r\n\r\nSo we went back to the reseller and
  asked them to resupply Type1 fonts for the MACs then create new TrueTypes for the
  PCs using Type1 filenames. They\u2019ve done it the other way round and supplied
  us with Type1s created to match the TrueTypes, apparently saying to our IT folk
  that \u2018the TrueTypes are superior anyway\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe PDF bugs have gone
  away, because we are using PostScript fonts again, but the fonts still appear as
  individual faces in application font menus. \r\n\r\nSo the quick question at the
  end of the long story is\u2026 Is there a way to have the MAC Type1 fonts talk to
  the PC TrueTypes across the network, but also for them to work appropriately for
  us within the studio?\r\n\r\nPS: Another thing that might be relevant \u2013 we\u2019re
  not using Suitcase or a similar app to manage fonts, they are put straight into
  the System Library by IT. (My workplace is a government department, where bureaucracy
  is valued over practicality)\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks Si, \r\nNot entirely sure if there is an OpenType version of that
      particular font available, plus we're trying to get this sorted out under our
      current font licensing, to avoid having to pay for more fonts. Will the OpenType
      versions only work in CS as opposed to pre-CS versions?\r\n"

  body: OpenType fonts will work with pre-CS Adobe applications (and other non-Adobe
    applications), but you won't have access to many of the OpenType features. One
    problem you may encounter, however, is that if your older files make use of small-cap
    or "expert" characters, your documents will want to find those glyphs in separate
    font files; most OpenType fonts now include both within the glyph palette of the
    basic font style (roman, italic, bold, etc.). Your dilemma sounds to me like a
    royal headache, or, that is, a bureaucratic headache, because what it boils down
    to is the fact that your workflow is outdated and needs to let go of what was
    and accept that technology changes. I don't envy your position.

  body: "Cameron,\r\n\r\nThe problem you're encountering is not directly related to
    font format as such. You want to have the same menu names on Mac and Windows.
    This is possible regardless of font format involved, but it requires the font
    developer have considerable understanding of the menu name issues. These include
    the particular name structures (PostScript FontName, PostScript FullName) that
    Adobe applications use to generate their cross-platform menu names and determine
    family groupings in our font menus.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's possible to do all this
    consistently, regardless of font format, and even across font formats and platforms.
    But the font developer needs to know what they're doing. It's not something you
    can solve as an end user - unless you count modifying the fonts yourselves, which
    may not even be permissible under the license agreement (EULA).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nThomas

  body: "Thomas, \r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. It's good to hear that it is possible,
    at least in theory. I would have thought that the font reseller would know what
    they are doing, but the situation certainly isn't helped by having 3 degrees of
    separation between them and us in the studio...\r\n\r\nOnward and upward!"
