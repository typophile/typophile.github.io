  body: Yeah, I agree. If it would help, the edges appear roughed - and not just because
    of the quality of ink/printing. I'm very sure it is a feature of the face. Hope
    that helps. Thanks.

    The regular is a perfect match."

  body: "Forrest,\r\n\r\nNot at all!\r\n\r\nWhen I linked to the Perla family, it
    shows the alternate in the preview instead of the regular one.  I should've changed
    the link to show the <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=795&dw=2616\"
    target=\"_blank\">regular</a> form."

  body: It's still not Perla though. We've run into the Henry Bendel packaging before
    and came to the conclusion that -- while the type resemble Perla quite a bit --
    a lot of inconsistencies in the character shapes make us believe they are in fact
    hand lettered.

  body: Perla and Filosofia Unicase are wonderful alternatives though, so please don't
    mind me. :-)
