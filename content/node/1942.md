  <BR> <BR>FontClaire started with a sketch of the lower case g and turned into a
  student BFA project. It&#39;s still incomplete, lacking numerals and full punctuation,
  but I&#39;m very happy with it&#39;s progress, so far--even though I haven&#39;t
  touched it in years. <BR> <BR>I really like the upper case, but still feel like
  the lower case needs more unity. Any thoughts? <BR> <BR>//joe

  body: ' very very cool. an interesting combination of the geometric and organic.
    I&#39;m debating with myself about the uc S. It is a little wider than the other
    letters, and makes the texture a bit uneven. However, I think the imperfection
    adds to the character of the face. I would definitely loose the taper on the top
    end, though. I&#39;m with simon on the lc. i really like. I would loose the kink
    on the upper arm of the k &#40;it works on the uc&#41;-- it feels like it could
    be simplified. The x&#39;s kind of bug me. it seems the curved geometry is justified
    on the other letters, but feels forced on the x. <BR> <BR>are you planning on
    publishing it any time soon? <BR> <BR>cr '

  body: ' Good comments and thanks. <BR> <BR>Simon, I wonder if you could be more
    specific about the UC... <BR> <BR>Christian, you mention the x. I&#39;ve always
    had second thoughts about it. I&#39;ve also considered making the UC A with an
    apex, rather than a rounded top. I could see that working well with elements from
    the v and a more standard x, like you suggest. <BR> <BR>And, yes, you&#39;ve found
    my biggest personal weakness, that S. Heh. '

    <BR>Here&#39;s a better sample of the lowercase for your reference. My biggest
    question is how the upper relates to the lower case &#40;the cap-height, mostly&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Also, how is the rhythm of the UC versus the rhythm of the lc? Do these
    relate well? I feel like it needs some work, but am unsure about the next steps...

  body: ' Joe. I said it once and I&#39;ll said it again. Beautiful. I agree with
    Christian. The &#39;S&#39; seems to be falling backwards. Maybe tapering the bottom
    and ending it a bit sooner would resolve the top issue. Have you set a whole page?
    Our language isn&#39;t hampered with the usage of too many capital letters &#40;in
    body set type&#41; so perhaps your concern with the lower and the upper isn&#39;t
    of such great import? How about your little trick on the &#39;k&#39;? Perhaps
    incorporating that trick somehow in the &#39;x&#39;? Because of the narrowness
    of the letters you might tighten up the over all word spacing as well. The &#39;r&#39;
    seems to want a little more curve into the stem? <BR> <BR>Beautiful. '

    do&#41; it looks perfect. many congrats!!!!! hope to see this one working soon. '

    remove some of the disruption their verticality lends. try dropping them _slightly_
    below the hight of the lc acenders. <BR> <BR>and i would second the comment about
    the lc w, it seems to grab too much attention '

    letters tend to feel like thery float when the just touch the baseline and dont
