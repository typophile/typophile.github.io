body: "Hi Guys!\r\n\r\nI have been a long time reader and just joined the community
  so this is my first post!  \r\n\r\nI am designing a logo for a golf tip website
  and am a little stuck on the font choice and overall design.  I have attached a
  mockup of the different options I have at this point with the respective font choices
  I have narrowed it down to.  I was hoping you guys could give me feedback on which
  design you like the most at this early stage. \r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions
  for another font choice please let me know.  I would like to use the same font for
  the logo as the headlines and navigation within the site itself. \r\n\r\nAlso, there
  are several alternate layouts which I included.  Since the domain name is three
  words, I am struggling to create a logo to incorporate the three words while maintaining
  continuity.  Thus, if you have any input on a better way to layout the logo please
  let me know.  \r\n\r\nAlong those same lines, as you can see most if not all of
  the fonts were used in their black or extra black weight.  If you have any other
  suggestions as to a font or a font weight please let me know.  \r\n\r\nMoreover,
  since I have already expanded the scope of the inquiry, if you have any other suggestions
  on the color scheme of the logo or as well as the golfer logo itself please let
  me know.  My goal was simplicity, and thus I did not add any gradients or the like
  to the golfer logo but if anyone thinks it would help it would me much appreciated.
  \  \r\n\r\nThanks for all your input and help in advance!"

  body: "I think layout B2 is the most dynamic of the various options. Futura XBk
    Condensed or Glasgow Black are my favourites of the options you've given.\r\n\r\nI
    think that any of the variations you've created will work. The only thing I would
    suggest is that the kerning is a little off in some places. This could be due
    to the resolution of the .jpg, so I'd want to see a .pdf to give proper critique.\r\n\r\n

  body: Whatever you use, open up the spacing in the name, some of your characters
    are crashing. I think the little golfer is a little trite. The color is fine.
    Did you look at maybe making the name as if it was burned in grass with the o
    in Golf as the hole? It might make a nice splash graphic for your site.

  body: Wow, I really appreciate all the help.  I did tweak with the kerning alot
    on most of the examples, so I will keep that in mind.  I also appreciate the observation
    that the golfer was trite.  I was trying to keep things simple and was avoiding
    being trite, but in the end I guess that is where I may have ended up.  Any additional
    observations would be very much appreciated.  Thanks!

  body: "LFT in uppercase is always going to present problems with kerning when it
    is so tight, have you considered lowercase? GolfTipsArchive, using the secondary
    colour for Tips, which would help reading it as three words while still being
    clear that they make up the url.\r\nTim"

  body: I have not toyed around with using lower case too much at all, but I definitely
    will give it a shot.  Thanks!
