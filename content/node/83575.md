body: "Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and for any help you
  can offer. I realize that some sports teams use custom fonts, and therefore they
  aren't able to be IDed, but since this is used somewhat casually about their web
  site, I'm hoping it's an exception to that \"rule\".\r\n\r\nThe font I'm interested
  in ID-ing is the slab serif font used for the USNA Midshipman's logo as seen on
  NavySports.com \r\n\r\nit can be seen on these graphics and the one attached:\r\nhttp://grfx.cstv.com/schools/navy/graphics/allaccess-main.jpg\r\n\r\nthe
  'AVYSPORTS' part:\r\nhttp://grfx.cstv.com/schools/navy/graphics/navy-11-mast-left.gif\r\n\r\nthere
  are more examples on NavySports.com in flash and in some of the graphics (they do
  not use this one exclusively though).\r\n\r\nThe 'N' used for their logo may have
  been in use since the 1940's, however, I'm not sure if it's the same font still,
  as it looks like the N in Rockwell, while the A used on the website does not.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"
