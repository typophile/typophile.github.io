body: "How can we identify each font purposes to?\r\nJust like Comic Sans for children's
  things, Times for formal texts, Grunge font for urban art and so on. Are there basic
  parameter that we can use? The parameter must be accepted by people globally (like
  measurement system of International that accepted globally).\r\n\r\nIf the basic
  parameter is found, there is no inappropriate using of font anymore. During this
  time, People commonly using feeling instead of thinking while using font. That's
  it. We need parameter. Here need a professor thinking i think :)\r\n\r\n\r\nGunarta"

  body: "Typography is an art, and as such it can't be reduced to a formula. A good
    design education, which takes years, will teach you some common-sense guidelines
    about what works for children, for advertising, for books and magazines, and so
    forth. But clients hire a designer because he or she has the skill to use type
    in unexpected and pleasing ways.\r\n\r\nAny fool can pick type off a list, and
    most of the \"inappropriate\" uses of type you refer to are the work of clients
    who didn't want to spend money hiring a professional designer. "

  body: "I agree with Nick :) \r\n\r\nYou can give some guidelines, such as that some
    fonts are less suitable for extended text, or for small sizes on the screen. But
    beyond such practical constraints, once you are dealing primarily with aesthetics,
    trying to do something like this is a fools errand, if you ask me.  "
