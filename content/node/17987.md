body: There's a font on my Agency's server called "WorldClass" which seems to a copy
  of a more popular script. An old client is asking where they can acquire a license
  for it. If someone knows the foundry behind "WorldClass" or can ID a similar font
  that is available, that would be sweet. Let me know if you need to see any more
  samples. Thanks!

    EULA isn't so clear) so if you have valid Bickham Script Pro licenses then you
    *might* be legal.  "

  body: But Bickham Script is an Adobe font and so Linotype's EULA does not apply
    to it. You are right however, to now have educated yourself with the fact that
    Linotype's fonts are not modifiable with their present EULA.
