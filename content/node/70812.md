  still working on the full character set, so no pdf just yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think?"

  body: "Looks like a good idea. \r\nThe counters of e and s could be a tad larger.
    I had problems reading \"sharp\" at first, as s, a and o are very similar, so
    you need context. Maybe the o would be better off without a connecting stroke
    to the right. \r\nThe spacing of de in \"idea\" appears too wide to me, but -
    almost - ok in \"Tide\".\r\nI can't really imagine how your f is written with
    a pen.\r\nAnd maybe the i-dot could have a slant to go with the penstroke.\r\n\r\nMy
    2p.\r\nAndreas\r\n"

  body: Good points. With this font I'm looking for some edges of readability.

  body: "Hi- \r\nTh I fixed, but with 'de' I had no choice, like with all 'e' connections:
    it's same connection to all lower case characters. With some exeptions."
