  body: 'Thanks Renko, I guess that''s the closest match I''ll find, but comparing
    the two Psychedelic Smoke is much more round. The example above must have been
    made using found type. '

  body: "There is a typeface called \"Tandem\" shown in the Solotype Catalog on page
    11, just below the sample of \"Smoke\", that looks like your sample, except that
    there are small 'tabs' at the baseline on each letter. Your sample looks like
    it with the tabs removed. Anybody's guess what name the digital version may have
    now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    my Alphabet Thesaurus Vol. 3 from Photo-Lettering, is the whole character set
    displayed in the Solotype Catalog? '
