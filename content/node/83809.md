body: I don't use blackletters much, so I'm not good with ID'ing them, if anyone can
  point me in the right direction, I'd be most appreciative...:-) The distressing
  is custom I'm certain, so don't worry about that.

    version of Engravers Old English. The y is one key feature. The base serifs have
    been left off when I compare these letters to the Engravers font.\r\n\r\n- Mike
