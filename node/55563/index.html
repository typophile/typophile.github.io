  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello There!</p>
<p>I am a student and I was wondering if anyone knows of any good affordable font packages? Or perhaps an option to buy 1 font instead of the whole set? Just have a limited budget and I&rsquo;m really getting bored of what I have and the free fonts are starting to disgust me.
Also does anyone have this book?  <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/">http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/</a> 
Is it useful? I so want it. It looks like it could be very helpful!! 
I am drooling&hellip; mmmmm&hellip;&hellip;.fontbook&hellip;.</p>

<p>Museo/Museo Sans are quite affordable.</p>
<p>Watch eBay for old copies of Corel Draw, which comes with 1000+ Bitstream/ITC fonts. Prices run from $50 to $500 depending on what version is selling and how many copies are available. Or drop $1500 at once to get the complete Bitstream Type Odyssey 2 which will get you through school and well into your professional career.</p>
<p><cite>…fontbook…</cite></p>
<p>If you can’t afford fonts, there’s really no reason to buy a $100 font catalog.</p>

That&rsquo;s the thing, fontbook is expensive. but it&rsquo;s kinda just like window shopping. I&rsquo;m still a student and I want to feed my head with all that is out there. Just looking at type gets me all excited!!  and if I like it enough I&rsquo;ll start saving up so I can eventually buy it.</div>

So is this meant for non-profit, educational work only, or does it come with the full licence so the fonts can also legally be used commercially?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Altaira: All of Adobe&rsquo;s educational software licenses contain no restrictions on what you can do with the software above those placed on regular retail licensees, just more restrictions on who can license it. You can use it for commercial work while you&rsquo;re a student (or afterwards) as you wish.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and they could have changed things when I wasn&rsquo;t looking, and you should certainly examine the license yourself prior to purchasing, and similar disclaimers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No exactly an answer to the question but&hellip;</p>
<p>I remember at the TypeCon in Boston there were some break out sessions during the Educational forum which preceded the conference.</p>
<p>One such session was about creating low-priced font packs for students and teachers to use. Of the five or six people at the session four were from foundries. Only two instructors bothered to come by, and if I remember correctly they had very little to contribute. There was clearly an interest on the part of the type makers to create something of value for students, but I guess we were the only ones interested.</p>

<p>Ascender&rsquo;s Font Marketplace is sort of based on what Monotype used to do (in the 1990s) with their discount font packages. They have packages and single user-based pricing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fontmarketplace.com">http://www.fontmarketplace.com</a></p>
<p>Font Packs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fontmarketplace.com/store/search.aspx?q=font+pack">http://www.fontmarketplace.com/store/search.aspx?q=font+pack</a></p>
<p>Also, when I started out (after school) I simply started purchasing a few specific packages that I&rsquo;d save up for and end up using over and over again. At the time, Adobe Caslon became my mainstay. And eventually client work ended up paying for my investment up front. Ask yourself, what fonts would really last a lifetime?</p>
<p>(And unfortunately, Monotype&rsquo;s Columbus package didn&rsquo;t; but their marketing really did suck me in. I will find a use for it someday!) :)</p>

<p>In the early days of font digitizing URW was one of the only digitizing games in town. It offered two price structures. The lower price delivered the digital data to the original company, but allowed URW the right to use the digital data.The more expensive option was to deliver the digital data to the source company with no reuse rights. Most companies chose the less expensive option which is why URW markets look-alike fonts under different names. All perfectly legal.</p>
<p>And their Nimbus Sans Novus is the best digital Helvetica around.</p>
<p>When I was still doing graphic design n the early 90s I advised all my clients to buy URW&rsquo;s Fontworks CDs to get themselves a high quality digital library at a reasonable cost.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yves is very authoritative, but still fallible, and so, even, is David Lemon.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a misunderstanding here. <em>Some</em> fonts are restricted by Adobe&rsquo;s EULA for use with the app; see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/restricted_fonts.html">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/restricted_fonts.html</a></p>
<p>These are governed by clause 16.4.6 in the EULA (I&rsquo;m citing the one for InD CS5, and I quote some other clauses in the font section, because the modification and embedding rights in the Adobe EULA are notably liberal.)</p>
<p><cite>16.4 Font Software. If the Software includes font software:
16.4.1 You may use the font software with the Software on Computers as described in Section 2 and output the font software to any output device(s) connected to such Computer(s).
&hellip;
16.4.4 You may convert the font software into another format and install it for use in other environments, subject to the following conditions: A Computer on which the converted font software is used or installed will be considered as one of your Permitted Number of Computers. Use of the font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may be used only for your own customary internal business or personal use and may not be distributed or transferred for any purpose, except in accordance with Section 4.6 of this agreement.</cite></p>
<p><cite>16.4.5 You may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for the purpose of printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are embedding is identified as “licensed for editable embedding” on Adobe’s Web Site at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/embedding_eula_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/embedding_eula_ae</a>, you may also embed copies of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic documents. No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license.</cite></p>
<p>And, the clause that I think causes some confusion:</p>
<p><cite>16.4.6 As an exception to the above, the fonts listed at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts_ae</a> are included with the Software only for purposes of operation of the Software user interface and not for inclusion within any Output Files. Such listed fonts are not licensed under Sections 16.4.1 through 16.4.5 above. You agree that you will not copy, move, activate, or use, or allow any font management tool to copy, move, activate, or use such listed fonts in or with any software application, program, or file other than the Software.</cite></p>
<p>Clause 4.5 of the EULA discusses &ldquo;unbundling&rdquo;, at first it seems to support Yves contention:</p>
<p><cite>4.5 No Unbundling. The Software may include various applications, utilities, and components, may support multiple platforms and languages, and may be provided to you on multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the Software is designed and provided to you as a single product to be used as a single product on Computers as permitted by Sections 2 and 16.</cite></p>
<p><strong>Bu:t</strong></p>
<p><cite><strong>You are not required to install all component parts of the Software,</strong>(emphasis added) but you may not unbundle the component parts of the Software for use on different Computers. You may not unbundle or repackage the Software for distribution, transfer or resale. See Section 16 for specific exceptions to this Section 4.5.</em></p>
<p>So, you can&rsquo;t consider the font to have a license separate from the app, but if you hold a valid license, deleting some of the package doesn&rsquo;t void that license&hellip; otherwise we&rsquo;d be required to keep all the sample file installed!</p>
<p>And, furthermore:
<cite>2.8 Content Files. Unless stated otherwise in the “Read-Me” files or other license(s) associated with the Content Files, which may include specific rights and restrictions with respect to such materials, you may use, display, modify, reproduce and distribute any of the Content Files. However, you may not distribute the Content Files on a stand-alone basis (i.e., in circumstances in which the Content Files constitute the primary value of the product being distributed), and you may not claim any trademark rights in the Content Files or derivative works thereof.</cite></p>
<p>So, I think you <em>can</em> use the Adobe fonts without having the app  installed. What can you do with other fonts in other bundles? Well, one would have to read <em>those</em> EULAs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I wondered aout buying second hand corel software with fonts. How does this work licence wise. Normally fonts are licenced to a certain amount of users in one geographic location. The licence is transferrable, but often tis has to be arranged with the foundry. Reselling fonts is hardly if ever permitted. So how does it work if you buy a program (with fonts like corel) from someone who has the proper licence. Isn&rsquo;t this considered reselling. And what does the EULA of these fonts say about this? Is it actually legal to acquire fonts this way?</div>
