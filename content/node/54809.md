  - I'm doing it as a favor for my Aunt. It's for her church's youth group. I'm pretty
  happy with the image, but I feel like the image and the type are very disconnected
  - in a bad way. I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comp_opts1_4832.jpg]\r\n\r\n(I'm
  hoping you can see what I was going for, but in case you can't, I will explain.
  The dove is a well-known symbol of christianity, it is also supposed to serve as
  a hand holding a compass. If you're okay with a bit of a stretch, the inside of
  the compass kind of alludes to the Star of Bethlehem. But I realize that doesn't
  necessarily come across, and I'm okay with that.)"

    dominate the arrangement? Seems to me that the lettering is 'shouting too loud'
    next to the image, rather than supporting it.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say to trying
    'compass ministries' in smaller capitals, on two lines \u2013 above and below
    the image \u2013 centred and generously letterspaced? Maybe try a serif style
    to contrast against the forms of the logo? Good luck with it."

  body: "Some observations at a glance:\r\n<ol><li>The metaphor hand-as-a-dove has
    been profusely used; it's not necessarily a weakness, but I guess I've seen that
    precise image before (try these bad samples: [[http://www.alohapeaceproject.com/images/index/Logo.jpg|Aloha]],
    [[http://www.coalitionforkids.ca/images/coalition-for-kids-dove-logo.png|CFKI]]
    or [[http://scarletowls.urfcomics.com/images/AboutBITHTileLogo.gif|BITH]]).</li>\r\n<li>The
    compass doesn't seem that to me; I see a quirky 16-hours-clock, instead; probably
    you should quit some elements (it is quite busy), and enlarge orthogonal  beams
    in the rose; better: you could try tilting the vertical ones.</li>\r\n<li>Perhaps
    the disconnection you notice is in the font itself \u2013I wonder who's its designer\u2013,
    because it looks oddly geometric \u2013and I appreciate Geometry a lot\u2013,
    really ugly as sin (or that's what my displeased perception feels).</li></ol>\r\nNevertheless,
    I think your concept has potential. Just need more sensitive work.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "I agree with Ben you should try the two lines/generously spaced/serif solution;
    by the other side, all lowercase tends to be annoying and less readable, though
    overused.\r\n\r\n<strong>M.</strong>"

- body: "The font itself is incredibly wonky and unbalanced. I see technical problems
    in nearly every letter. I suggest shopping for a better quality font.\r\n\r\nI
    also agree with Marcelo about the symbol; it's painfully common to see a dove/hand
    used for a church. Why not make the compass itself into a logo? Perhaps with the
    arrow pointing to a cross? \r\n\r\nFor a youth group, I'm picturing an edgy/rugged
    yet sharp style (think Swiss Army) that appeals more to teens. I'd look at vintage
    compasses for inspiration, like [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/files/images/pilots-possessions/preview/pilots_possessions-004-rfc-wrist-compass.preview.jpg|this
    one]] from [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz|The Vintage Aviator]]."

  body: Yeah, now that I'm looking at it on here, the compass is a bit busy. I'll
    work on that a bit more, make it more recognizable. And I realize that the dove/hand
    thing might be used a lot, but really, when it comes to churches, what isn't cliche?
    There's really not much that hasn't been beaten to death there. Even your compass
    w/ cross thing, I've seen it many times. Alright, back to the drawing board. New
    typeface. Above and below. New image altogether. I will try it all. Thanks for
    your comments!

    movement; seen more hands'n'doves than I could shake a (pacifist) stick at. But
    sometimes clich\xE9s are all we got.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I wouldn't suggest doing
    a new image altogether and I would be concerned if you threw the designer baby
    out with the bathwater; just get the type to play nicer with what's there already."

  body: "Stef,\r\nJust not to be missunderstood: I didn't mean you should change the
    main image (actually, my words were \"it\u2019s not necessarily a weakness\");
    the only thing I pointed is that I \u2013and only I\u2013 had the sense of having
    seen the same image somewhere (probably in a locale brand), what made me feel
    uncomfortable a bit, but \u2013once again\u2013, that's just my troubled perception/long-term-memory.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    this is mainly a typographic design site, and one must realize from the beginning
    that all individual characters one could create are already created (since the
    'A' to the '\u20AC'), which is to say, we work on signs that are arbitrary clich\xE9s
    by definition. I think the unique limit is given by self authenticiy, beyond which
    one falls in the deadly sin of <em>kitsch</em>.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I beg
    you: throw away that hideous font, and you'll see how everything's gonna fit and
    work out.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"
