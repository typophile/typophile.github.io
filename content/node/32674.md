body: Can anybody here from Adobe (I can hear you breathing) comment on whether there
  is anything new in OT support in the new CS3 applications? I can't find anything
  about it on Adobe's site. I'm particularly curious if the former Macromedia apps
  have gained OT support.

  body: InDesign now supports 'locl' (Localized forms), 'rlig' (Required ligatures),
    'mark' (Mark positioning), 'mkmk' (Mark to mark positioning) and 'ccmp' (Glyph
    composition/decomposition). I think there's also additional support for 'init'
    (Initial forms), 'medi' (Medial forms), 'fina' (Terminal forms) and 'isol' (Isolated
    forms). I don't know about the other apps.
