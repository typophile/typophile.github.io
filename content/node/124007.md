body: "Trying to locate this industrial-looking and possible display face (GRAPHIC
  TREASURES and AMERICAN UNDERBELLY, not FROM THE) with no luck over the past week.
  Looks like some kind of Futura Display or a Gotham / Gothic Display, but not sure
  so listing under Sans. I think G, R, A, M, Y, S are the most unique out of these
  letters that will help to identify.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    body: Thanks for all of your time and replies! I really like this Liquorstore
      font, so may end up getting this if I can't find the exact one I'm looking for.
      The subtle difference are huge to me though. Thanks again!

  body: "I forgot to mention that this style is sometimes called gas-pipe. The link
    posted by Riccardo reminded me of this.\r\nAs for the letters in the image this
    could be lettering rather than a font as such. It would not be out of place as
    a US WPA poster from the 1930s. Also note from the Chank Diesel interview that
    this style was popular among signmakers because it was so easy to execute. I recall
    seeing many such signs in my rambles across North America years ago that had these
    general features. Most of these are now gone, replaced by chain brands of little
    artistic character.\r\nIMO Liquorstore is a good choice for a substitute.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Riccardo! That looks pretty damn close, if not exact! Definitely the
    best lead and info. Thanks again, Don. I've asked Aaron on Instagram, so hoping
    to hear back from him since he's uses this lettering pretty often and I do believe
    it's a font, though it looks like it could be a combo of these two WPA fonts.
    I'll keep you posted!

  body: The non-curved leg of the R is another distinction that I haven't been able
    to find. The alternate G got me so excited I forgot to check some of the other
    characters. Another is the M not touching the baseline on the middle leg.

  body: "Reminds me a bit of [[http://typophile.com/node/108315|this previous case]].
    Anyway, can't identify it either. If I have to recreate it, I'd probably start
    with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fort-foundry/industry|Industry]] Black, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/purista|Purista]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/oxide-pro|Oxide]] mainly because of
    closer x-width and even if it means more work to do: recreating /A (upside-down
    /U) and /Y (/U bottom half + vertical stroke), chopping off some terminals from
    /S (+ making spine horizontal or completely redrawing it starting a /O quarter)
    and /G (+ double sided crossbar).\r\nAdding some more alternatives to the list:

  body: Thanks, Ryuk! Industry has been at the top of my list since my search started,
    but you found a bunch of others that I didn't see before... Outage, Onramp, and
    Refrigerator are really good. A few of the ones you mentioned have a wider selection
    of glyphs with the rounded A and non-slabbed? S. Thanks, Don! Not just the weight,
    but the kerning looks better on Industry, which would save a ton of time. If I
    can't find the exact font, I'll probably end up needing to use two different ones
    to achieve the look I want. Still looking, but this helps a lot for Plan B! Still
    hoping to hear back from Aaron, but think he would've responded by now.
