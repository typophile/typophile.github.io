body: I've seen a number of posts recently, especially in the Type ID forum, that
  use "typo" to mean typeface or font. Did I miss a memo? "Beg the question" is already
  irretrievably lost; is typo going the same route?

    years ago with the onslaught of twitter-spam-blog-posts \"500 totally awesome
    creative uses of typo\" and \"300 incredible mind-blowing typo-based web sites\"
    and that kind of crap. \r\n\r\nNow, maybe it *is* a neologism or SMS-speak and
    perhaps I can be a bit forgiving if that's the case.  "

    the French usage. But... I guess we're stuck with the typo devil.

  body: "It's a contraction of \"rugby football\".\r\nHowever, Canada and Australia
    also went with \"football\" rather than \"rugby\" for their version, not just
    the US.\r\nThat was to differentiate it from traditional UK rugby, which was played
    in all three countries back in the day, \"soccer\" not so much.\r\nNow there is
    too much tradition to change it (not to mention the World Series).\r\n"

  body: "(not to mention the World Series).\r\n\r\n:-)  That's right, Nick.  We all
    know how much of the \"World\" participates in that little ditty.  Even if you
    count in Japan, because they have a few players in the Majors these days, or  the
    Dominican Republic, which has more players in the States than at home, you still
    don't come close to a true \"World\" series. At least this year, it is not just
    another of the same old Boston vs NYC skirmishes.\r\n\r\nChris"
