  rebranding a private bus company. The rebrand will include Identity, Bus Information
  (Timetables, Bus Flags, Information Posters, Corporate literature). \r\n\r\nHave
  been looking at Sans Serif Type all night (Looking at major bus public bus companies
  like TFL etc, Johnston, Din, Transit) but am looking for something relatively new
  with a least four different weights. Can anybody recommend a typeface that might
  fit my needs? Its a very exciting project to work on and I really want to get of
  to a good start by nailing the Typeface.\r\n\r\nI appreciate and am thankful for
  any advice give.\r\n\r\nP"

    about buses is their ponderousness,\r\nand the relative smelliness of the average
    passenger.\r\nYou can offset the former with a light, narrow, slanted\r\nfont.
    The latter is harder.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of local and cross city routes, but client wants a proper rebrand, there is budget
    to invest in good typography. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nSo keep away from the typography
    and invest in a bottle of deoderant that can mass spray a bus load of passengers
    ;). I'll give it a whirl cheers. Any one else?"

  body: "It indeed looks like an exciting project. For the main identity face, it
    would depend on the feeling the client is after (for example, some hint of irishness
    or a completely neutral international look?). But I think you will need something
    with proper Irish glyphs coverage in any case.\r\nAs for timetables, here (http://typophile.com/node/90212)
    are some considerations, and here (http://typophile.com/node/75444) some suggestions."

    to be an international look, highly functional, what ever typeface I will select
    will be versatile to work across all mediums, web, logotype, small print size
    for timetables, large signage etc. Looking at particular Sans serifs developed
    in the last 5 years for this particular type of project. \r\n\r\nBefore I sign
    of anyone else got suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks again all."
