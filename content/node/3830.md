  have going on this site.  Lemme tell you a bit about myself.  I am currently 17
  years old &#40;turn 18 next March &#40;yay!&#41;&#41;, and am an aspiring graphic
  designer.  I am enrolled in the second, and final, year of a Visual Communications
  course at my county&#39;s vocational school, after which I plan on going to Mohawk
  Valley Community College in Utica, NY to get my 2-yr. degree in, obviously, graphic
  design.  Other than graphic design, I play a Peavey Patriot 4-string bass for my
  really cool band &#40;no demo tapes yet&#41;, and I am addicted to the strategy
  game &#34;StarCraft: Brood War&#34;.  I enjoy taking long strolls on the beach,
  and I consider myself a hopeless romantic <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;">  lol sorry, got a little carried away with myself.  Anyhue &#40;little
  graphic designer joke&#41;, thanks for reading my excruciatingly long self-description,
  and I hope to meet you all here in the forums. <BR> <BR>                                          -Cliffy

  body: Hi Cliff, <BR> <BR>Nice to see another person from Upstate NY. I grew up in
    Schenectady, but I live out in San Francisco these days &#40;for the moment, anyway&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>If you haven&#39;t already, you ought look into a summer program run
    out of Ithaca for high school students that dealt with graphic design, especially
    video and interactive &#40;albeit when interactive meant &#34;flashy read-only
    &#39;multimedia&#39;&#34;&#41; design. A friend of mine went through such a program
    and really enjoyed it. I don&#39;t remember much about it, but I&#39;ll see if
    I can get you more details if you&#39;re interested.
