    Fairfield]]. The thin strokes appear thicker because the 1942 sample was printed
    by letterpress. The capital T in the digital version of Fairfield has serifs that
    are slightly different than this (probably Linotype) version. '

  body: "Thanks. Yes, the beauty of letterpress! An ideal digital transformation would
    take that \"thickening\" effect into account, no? \r\n\r\nHow about the title
    face, \"Master and Disciple\"? That looks like something else. (This is a chapter
    heading). And those ornaments?"

  body: "The caps look like Fairfield too. Not sure about the ornaments. They're probably
    Monotype or foundry type. You'd need to research old metal type specimen books
    to find an exact ID, but if you just want something with that look and feel, try

  body: 'See the serifs on the S of the caps: they slant, whereas the Fairfield serifs
    are perfectly vertical.  Also, the leg of the R is straight, but curvy in Fairfield.
    Again, the top of the T is perfectly flat; not so Fairfield. Maybe not Fairfield?
    Or a variant?...'
