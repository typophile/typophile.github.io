  body: There was a discussion about this recently over on the FontLab forum. Adding
    &#34;Greek&#34; to the supported code pages and unicode ranges fixes it for some
    mysterious reason, even if you don&#39;t have a full Greek character set. I tried
    it on a set of fonts I&#39;m working on and it works.

  body: I&#39;m stumped then.  <BR> <BR>One thing I noticed before I tried this was
    that my fonts were showing up in FontBook with all sorts of accents sprouting
    out of the characters in the basic A-Z, a-z, 0-9 font showing. When I got it working
    with CS apps, the accents disappeared. This makes me think this is an OS X problem,
    not an Adobe CS problem.  <BR> <BR>Hasn&#39;t this dilemma come up here before?

  body: The answer is often both. <BR> <BR>OS X has had various font related bugs.
    One was  associated with how it maps glyphs to characters for fonts with extended
    language support in apps that are not doing Unicode. Sometimes weird stuff would
    show up in what ought to have been the regular MacRoman range. I believe this
    was fixed in 10.3.6 IIRC. <BR> <BR>OS X and InDesign both have a notion of being
    able to identify the primary codepage of a font. This is an obviously questionable
    idea in today&#39;s universe of multi-lingual fonts, but they try to do it. InDesign
    uses this info to group fonts in its font menus, so all the Cyrillic fonts will
    be in one group below the western fonts, and so on. <BR> <BR>First, in addition
    to the obvious problems with the idea itself, there have been errors in the heuristics
    used by both OS X and InDesign to do this. InDesign has fixed some of its errors,
    but if the font is installed at the OS level, InD will simply query the OS for
    info. <BR> <BR>Adobe recognizes that there is a real problem here, and hopes to
    significantly improve this area in the future. However, I can&#39;t comment specifically
    on features and bug fixes for unannounced future products. <BR> <BR>Even if it
    solved the problem, I wouldn&#39;t recommend labeling your fonts as supporting
    codepages they do not in fact support. That sort of thing is bound to get you
    into trouble. <BR> <BR>If within a given family, some fonts are sorting differently
    than others, I would check your settings for supported codepages and make sure
    they are consistent for all fonts in the family. After that, I&#39;d try cleaning
    both the OS X font cache and the Adobe font cache files. Also see if the behavior
    is the same if the font is installed in a private Adobe fonts location rather
    than in the Mac OS. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    so mucking around with adding unsupported codepages &#40;even though it seems
    to work, at least in some cases&#41; should be avoided. <BR> <BR>In the mean time,

    with no success.  <BR> <BR>Out of desperation, I waded through the message boards

    me, and half the time Safari tries to download the .msnw pages instead of displaying
    them, arrgh!&#41;, and lo and behold, I found a work-around devised by John Butler
    that appears to be reliable and doesn&#39;t involve doing anything dodgy to the
    fonts themselves.  <BR> <BR>Here it is: <BR> <BR>In addition to installing the
    problematic OTF font in the usual way &#40;I use FontBook&#41;, put a copy in
    [your hard drive name here]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/ . <BR> <BR>This
    is actually slightly modified from John&#39;s version. He says to put them in
    a folder for a specific Adobe application, but this one is used by all of them
    &#40;presumably&#41; and seems more logical. <BR> <BR>The way it seems to work
    is that Adobe apps look in Adobe&#39;s font directories first, correctly identify
    the main script supported and place it in the correct section of the font menu.
    The other copy installed in the system font directory is ignored, but makes the
    font available to non-Adobe apps. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if a similar procedure
    would work with Windows. I don&#39;t have Windows copies of Adobe apps to test.
    <BR> <BR>This general idea was touched on above when Thomas mentioned moving fonts
    to Adobe&#39;s private font locations for testing purposes, but that hides the
    fonts from other apps. The key thing that makes this work is putting copies of
    problem fonts in both Adobe and system locations. <BR> <BR>So far, I haven&#39;t
    found any problems with this work-around, and it seems like it would be a simple
    enough procedure to explain to customers, not that this sort of thing should be
    necessary in the first place.'

    makes an archive with a documented case &#40;detailed description, sample fonts,

  body: 'BTW, the reason many Adobe multilingual OpenType fonts do not exhibit this
    buggy behavior is... that there used to be &#40;I&#39;m not sure if there still
    is&#41; a mis-behavior &#40;sort of &#34;buglet&#34;&#41; of the Adobe FDK for
    OpenType that automatically turned on the flag indicating support for the Greek
    codepage even if just the Omega and the mu characters were included.  <BR> <BR>As
    we know, these characters are included in most Western and also Western&#43;CE
    fonts because they&#39;re in the MacOS Roman codepage. According to the spec and
    general reason, a flag indicating support for a given codepage in a font should
    only be set if the font includes all or, at least, most characters of that codepage.
    But indeed, the Adobe FDK for OpenType logic that controlled the codepage support
    flags used to be &#42;very liberal&#42;.  <BR> <BR>Therefore, a large majority
    of Adobe OpenType fonts -- even those that only contain Omega and mu -- indicate
    the support of the Greek codepage. This leads to various problems in applications
    such as Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, Firefox etc. For example, under certain
    circumstances, Internet Explorer may pick one of these fonts as the basic text
    font for Greek even if the font only contains these two Greek glyphs.  <BR>Since
    FontLab 4 uses the Adobe FDK for OpenType &#40;AFDKO&#41; code to produce OpenType
    fonts, in the 4.0 and &#40;I believe&#41; 4.5 versions, FontLab behaved similarly.
    When an OpenType PS &#40;.otf&#41; font was produced, FontLab 4.0 and 4.5 ignored
    the Supported Codepages settings in the Font Info dialog and used the very &#34;liberal&#34;
    logic of the AFDKO code to generate the flags.  <BR> <BR>A side-effect of this
    mis-behavior was that, indeed, the presence of the Greek flag prohibited most
    of AFDKO- or FontLab-made OpenType PS fonts from being listed in the non-Western
    part of the font list in Apple and Adobe applications.  <BR> <BR>So the bug in
    the Adobe applications e.g. InDesign, and in Mac OS X was initially overlooked
    due to a bug in the AFDKO code that was used by Adobe to produce their OpenType
    fonts, and is also used by FontLab.  <BR> <BR>As I explained above, FontLab 4.0
    and 4.5 ignored the Supported Codepage settings in Font Info when making OpenType
    PS fonts and used the AFDKO auto-logic. Since the stand-alone AFDKO version does
    not have explicit means to set the codepage flags, the use of the auto-logic in
    the stand-alone AFDKO did make sense &#40;although the problem of course was that
    the logic was flawed.&#41; But since FontLab has the Supported Codepage dialog
    to set these fields explicitly, the product should use them rather than always
    use the AFDKO logic. So with FontLab 4.6, we stopped using the AFDKO logic and
    started using the Font Info settings &#40;that were always used in OpenType TT
    fonts, BTW&#41;.  <BR> <BR>At that moment, the Apple/Adobe problem with listing
    the OpenType PS fonts in the non-Western section manifested itself. So far, it
    was &#34;covered&#34; by the overzealous AFDKO logic that unvoluntarily set the
    Greek flag. But of course with FontLab 4.6, the users did not explicitly set the
    Greek flag, since logically, this does not make sense. But indeed, the fonts without
    that flag tend to show up in the non-Western section...  <BR> <BR>Of course setting
    flags for codepages that are not truly supported in the font is a bad idea. This
    was a bad idea in AFDKO, it was bad that most Adobe OpenType fonts have this flag
    set.  <BR> <BR>So the thing is: a superflous Greek codepage flag makes some applications
    &#40;Word, IE etc.&#41; think that the font supports full Greek. But this manifests
    itself only to people using Greek, which is a minority. The absence of the Greek
    codepage flag makes other applications &#40;InDesign, various OS X apps&#41; put
    the font into the non-Western section. This clearly affects many more users, namely
    all Roman script users in West, Central and East Europe, in North America and
    all around the world.  <BR> <BR>Setting the Greek flag is a hack. Yet, I believe
    this is &#34;less worse&#34; than not using it. After Apple and Adobe have fixed
    their applications, the font developers can update their fonts and remove the
    superflous Greek flag.  <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s Greek to me&#34; truly gets a new
    meaning here...  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'

    work fine as soon as Apple and Adobe fix the bug so just be patient,&#34; I suspect
    won&#39;t cut it. <BR> <BR>As I mentioned above, perhaps the right thing to do
    would be to actually add support for Greek. I&#39;m already covering the rest
    of Europe, so, what the hey.

    because they show up at the bottom of the menu? Or am I missing something? <BR>
    <BR>Side note: Greek caps are easy for us English-speakers, but Greek lowercase

  body: Well, with certain applications, TexEdit &#40;not to be confused with TextEdit&#41;
    was the one I noticed, the fonts displayed in Geneva. In something else &#40;I
    can&#39;t remember now what--I was trying lots of things very quickly&#41; only
    some of the fonts in the family were listed in the menu. Granted, some of these
    problems may have been transient, having something to do with caches or whatever,
    although I did my best to delete all the caches every time I made the slightest
    change before reinstalling and testing the fonts again.  <BR> <BR>I might add
    that this is a very big family, 21 fonts, and it will double when I get to the
    italics. That factor may contribute to some of the problems I&#39;ve been having,
    but it doesn&#39;t seem so. <BR> <BR>The thing that&#39;s troubling me now is
    that Quark doesn&#39;t recognize the fonts at all, regardless of whether I use
    the hack or not.

  body: Okay, this is weird. Quark &#40;6.5&#41; recognizes the fonts if I install
    them manually by dragging them to ~/Library/Fonts/, but not if I used FontBook,
    unless I quit Quark and restart it.  <BR> <BR>Never mind.

    now why it wasn&#39;t displaying all the fonts in the family: Some of the names
    are too long. 29 characters seems to be the limit. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve read
    about this somewhere before &#40;FontLab manual?&#41;. Word has the same problem.
    <BR> <BR>Eric, how do your &#34;bottom menu&#34; fonts appear in Word?'

    &#40;19 is the longest in the fonts I&#39;m working on&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    either &#40;or both&#41; the &#34;Full Name&#34; or &#34;Mac Name&#34; I think
    that Word and Excel are choking on.

    fine, just at the bottom. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there is a perfectly logical reason
    for the TextEdit <BR>and TextWrangler menu performance. Likely to do with something
    <BR>sharing the name of a warm chocolate drink.

    another oddity with OpenType fonts: In Flash, if you &#34;bold&#34; a font &#40;assuming
    you&#39;ve set up R/I/B/BI for a family&#41;, it stretches the bold font slightly.
    The solution is to choose the bold font directly and not use the &#34;bold&#34;
    style button. This seems to happen with any OT font, not just mine.'

    <em>seems</em> to remedy this. Can anyone confirm this?
