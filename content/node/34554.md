  luck, so I'm going to post this here in the hopes that someone will recognize this
  font.  I'm fairly sure it's commercially available - it's been used in a number
  of sources extensively.  Hopefully this font will ring a bell here -- you guys are
  experts, I'm trusting you!  :D\r\n\r\nThe font I'm looking for is the font used
  the logo for \"The Ring.\"  A possibly modified version was used in the cover for
  the Thai movie \"Shutter.\"  The examples that follow are all taken from the HBO
  Making-Of special on the DVD for \"The Ring Two.\"  (The font was also used as the
  font for captions in the last few episodes of \"Scariest Places on Earth\" which
  aired last Halloween; unfortunately as of now I don't have any examples of those.)\r\n\r\nHere
  are the examples I have so far ... they should be enough to at least form a rough
  outline of the font in question.\r\n\r\n\"Shutter\" cover:\r\nhttp://www.bloody-disgusting.com/gallery/phpThumb.php?src=/gallery/images/760/poster.jpg&w=280\r\n\r\n\"The
  Ring Two\" examples:\r\nhttp://img249.imageshack.us/img249/8148/rickbakerlf1.jpg\r\nhttp://img486.imageshack.us/img486/6245/theringtwo0in4.jpg\r\nhttp://img486.imageshack.us/img486/1880/theringtwo1ld5.jpg\r\nhttp://img486.imageshack.us/img486/9287/theringtwo2gu4.jpg\r\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/7016/theringtwo3xl8.jpg\r\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5953/theringtwo4tv1.jpg\r\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/1636/theringtwo5yo2.jpg\r\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/2723/theringtwo6pu5.jpg\r\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4753/theringtwo7ar7.jpg\r\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/3353/theringtwo8tu1.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n-BT7\r\n"

    Providence Sans</a> as an alternative.

    This might be a hard one because most people wouldn't download anything that horrible
    looking even if it was free.\r\n; )"

  body: That might be true, though Providence Sans could be perfect for horror movie
    titles if used properly. For "scarier" handwritten fonts, consider something from
    <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=fontsbystyle&s=4">House Industries</a>.

  body: "Providence Sans is actually a lovely font. I love the g.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m
    fairly sure it\u2019s commercially available -\r\n\r\nThe place I've seen fonts
    like this is at deviantart.com\r\n\r\nOne other idea. There was a salesman at
    our office who wrote almost exactly like this. I'll bet for a price he would hand-letter
    your job. He lives in So. Cal. Let me know if you want me to hook you up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's not so much NEEDING the font as it is wanting to know what it is.  Ever
    since I first saw the logo for \"The Ring\" I've been obsessed by it -- kind of
    fitting, when you think about the content of the film.  It's like a childish scrawl,
    but there's something unnerving about it.     The font in the pictures is undeniably
    ugly - but it's also sort of cool.  Maybe I'm alone there.  I don't know.  Fonts
    can't all be perfectly proportioned.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it's commercially
    available is because on the show \"Scariest Places on Earth\" (I'm a bit obsessive
    over that show) they used to use this creepy handwritten font.  When I posted
    a font request over at the WhatTheFont forum, they came back with \"Herrick's
    Hand\" (see here: http://www.kandjsupplies.com/text_fonts_handwriting/herricks_hand.html).\r\nI
    thought the SPOE font was custom-made, but then lo and behold: there's the font,
    commercially available.  (Just for the record, I've checked all the fonts at the
    kandjsupplies.com place...I've found a few results that come vaguely close, but
    nothing perfect.)  Another example: I swore that the font \"The Sixth Sense\"
    used was custom made.  Then - there it was, Las Bonitas.  Most fonts used in movies
    are available, even if they are slightly altered.  In the examples above, if you
    compare the letters ot those used in the logo for \"The Ring,\" you'll notice
    definite differences -- but also definite similarities.\r\n\r\nThis font, I can't
    tell if it's all lowercase or if they only use lowercase letters to achieve the
    \"Ring\" effect.\r\n\r\nAnother similar logo was used in the recent movie \"Reincarnation\"
    (an After Dark 8 Days of Horror or whatever film festival movie), seen here: http://www.impawards.com/2006/reincarnation.html.
    \ I realize that this poster uses handwriting - the letters don't match up, so
    it can't be a font, but it gives you a sort of idea about what I'm looking for.
    \ Argh.\r\n\r\n@fontplayer: I snooped around deviantart...by snooping I mean casually
    glancing ... and I couldn't find ANY fonts, period.  Is there like a section for
    them?  There's a possibility that some user-made font made it to the big screen
    -- the \"Harry Potter\" spinoff font \"Lumos\" that was designed to emulate Ablefont
    made its way onto the Harry Potter DVD menus, so you never know.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing.  Look at the Unrated Edition version of \"The Ring Two\" DVD.  The \"Unrated
    Version\" is written in a similar \"Ring\"y font.  http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJRVDVL._SS500_.jpg.
    \ So many examples...so few answers.\r\n\r\nWow, long post, and I lost exactly
    where I was going.  Long story short, keep your eyes peeled, and let me know if
    you find anything!\r\n\r\nThanks!! :)\r\n\r\n-BT7"

    a ton of them there. Many have the same look, which is for me: What were they
    thinking? But I guess there are twisted uses for such things. (and I mean that
    in the best way)\r\n: )\r\n\r\nAnd there is no good way to search for fonts at
    deviantart. They are usually posted on members pages as something they did on
    a lark. I see them when I go through Dr. Luc's latest fonts pages. Here is one
    I just found that way (I hope the link works)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/deviation/53991908/?qo=6&q=by%3Aerzahler&qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps
