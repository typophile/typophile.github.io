  body: "If you want to use the fonts, unmodified, for serious bookwork, Charter is
    the one to use. Charis, though, has fantastic potential, with its extensive character
    set. And modification, esp. for one's own use, is allowed by the license.\r\n\r\nI
    picked Charis to use for a recent book because Charter was designed when the print
    workflow was repro-negative-plate, and to my eye, comes out a bit light when printed
    CTP (computer to plate) on a high-resolution offset press. Charis likely will
    print better.\r\n\r\nI did do a fair bit or re-working of the fonts, including
    old-style numbers, setwidth changes (esp. in italic), and kerning. I haven't seen
    the printed book yet. If you're interested, re-post in a month or so & I can let
    you know how it did.\r\n\r\n"
