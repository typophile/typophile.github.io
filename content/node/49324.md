  body: From the look of it I would guess this is a freeware or shareware font. You
    might try looking on dafont.com. Most of the folks on this site deal with professional
    typefaces from commercial foundries. Because of the huge amount of shareware fonts
    out there they can be tough to identify. Although it's not as squatty looking,
    an alternative you might like is [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Antenna/styles|Antenna]]
