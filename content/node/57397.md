  the cover page, so I can't say for sure when it was printed &ndash; but it's definitely
  pre-digital.\r\nDoes anybody recognize this, and/or know if it exists in digital
  form? WTF didn't know.\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kybalion_6318.gif]"

    slight distortion.\r\n2) Suggestions for similar fonts also welcome. FWIW, I'm
    especially intrigued by the \"k\" and \"y\"."

  body: "I am not at home with all my type books, so I was limited to searching my
    Serif Guide online, but I found some similar looks. The only one with a funky
    k and y similar to these was LSC Condensed, which was an old ITC face (digitized
    in old Image Club collections). However, the other details of this face are nothing
    like your sample. Other sort of similar high contrast faces that have digital
    versions: Arsis, Big Figgins, Didoni, Falstaff and Modern Heavy Condensed. Most
    of these had the similar y, but not the k. Most also have the 'a' with a curved
    tail.\r\n\r\nMaybe Mark Simonson will know, since his book collection is probably
    better than mine anyway.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks guys! That's a start.\r\n\r\nCraig, the one you mentioned is rather
    similar indeed structurally, except maybe for the \"b\". \r\nMike: Great pointers.
    LSC Condensed (<a href=\"http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/l/lsc-condensed.html\">this
    one, right?</a>) has a wild \"k\" indeed! :-)  I can see the curly-armed \"k\"
    seems to be quite rare, at least more so than the \"y\" form above.\r\n\r\nHmm\u2026
    I'm beginning to wonder if this is even a font. Although there is an \"il\" to
    go with the \"kybalion\" and I left it out because the \"i\" and \"l\" really
    look like they're the same; on the other hand, the letters don't seem to be lining
    up perfectly (as can be seen in the foot serif of the \"l\" above). Hm."

  body: "PS: This seems to have been quite a family. I found listings of a \"corsiva\",
    a \"strettissima\" (condensed?), and even a \"contornata\" (outlined? I wonder
    what THAT looked like!). The dates seem to differ a bit between different sources.
    \r\n\r\nOne strange thing is that <a href=\"http://www.global-type.org/Schriften.567.0.html\">Global
    Type</a> doesn't just list the medium as \"B\" (Blei = lead), but also \"T\" (Truetype)
    for the regular and italic, and for the outline version \"F\" (Fotosatz = phototype)
    and PS (PostScript). I wonder where that information comes from &ndash; or where
    it may lead. All the other sources I've found said nothing whatsoever about digital
    versions. \r\n(BTW I'm not urgently needing this for a current project or something;
    I'm just very intrigued.)"

    I find it strange how they left the ball terminal of the "f" "melt into" the following
    letter, and it ends up looking a bit like a wart growing from the latter. But
    maybe that's just me. :)

    discusion. I think yes: there\u2019s no point in repeating the same \u201Cmistakes\u201D
    (if the revivalist thinks there\u2019s a mistake to fix). I\u2019d go for a functional-pretty-coherent
    font, even if that implies some minor changes.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there\u2019s

  body: I would give Alessandro and Aldo the benefit of doubt on that 8. Just because
    it doesn't follow the usual model doesn't mean it's wrong. Maybe they considered
    it an innovation and it just never caught on. Maybe they thought there was something
    lacking in the typical fat-face 8.

    are one reason why I'm not sure I'd be capable of making (or wanting to make)
    revivals. I have nothing against this \"8\" structure in general, but with this
    sort of contrast it seems to look very odd. But yeah, maybe it's a matter of familiarity.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    looking at this again: Given that the original sample was in fact printed from
    metal type (which it looks like to me, not that I'm an expert), isn't there a
    *lot* of kerning going on? That \"kyb\" sequence is pretty impressive. "
