  text book was The Elements of Typographic Style. I remember the prof telling a story
  about the section of the book where Bringhurst talks about different fonts, and
  how there was a font he didn't like so he left it out. \r\n\r\nIs that true? What
  font was it?"

    anything about the snubbed font, or the reason he didn''t like it? '

  body: "Actually, Uncle Stinky has an entry in the very rare suppressed version 1.9
    of <em>The Elements of Typographic Style,</em> almost no copies of which are known
    to have survived. I've seen one, unbound copy but wasn't allowed to open it, and
    so far as I know not even Robert has a copy. It is worth a small fortune. Robert
    didn't write the Uncle Stinky entry, of course. Rumour has it it that the entry
    was inserted by a disgruntled typesetter at Hartley & Marks who quit the firm
    around the same time. The error was discovered at the printer's, only after the
    book had been printed and the individual signatures sewn. Thankfully, the covers
    had not been glued on yet, so only the last three signatures needed to be pulped
    and reprinted.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is something about proofreading,
    I guess."

    once worked as night-shift proofreader in a magazine printing plant. We also set
    type there. All was on very fast schedules all the time. A disgruntled day-shift
    reader made his exit one day after working on an article about Central America
    for a travel magazine.\r\n\r\nThis guy marked for the word \"banana\" to be inserted
    in the text at random spots. The resulting modified sentences made no sense at
    all. The proof went back to the Linotype VIP guys, who never bothered to read
    anything more than the reader's marks. Nothing odd at all about multiple insertions
    of \"banana\" in an article about Central America, right? Not when platemakers
    are breathing down your neck.\r\n\r\nThe insertions got made, the proof went back
    to the same disgruntled proofreader. He marked \"OK TO PLATE\" on the proof, punched
    out, got his stuff from his locker, and walked out. That was Friday. All hell
    broke loose Monday when the publisher saw his magazine, and the proofreader was
    not seen again in that city, as far as I know. \r\n\r\nThe proofreader was not
    I. \r\n\r\npowers"
