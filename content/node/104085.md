  body: Good catch Fivos! Seems to be it. I firstly thought it could have been [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]
    (Adobe or Linotype's version) squooshed. Darn close these ones, aren't they?

  body: Although there are distinct differences in e.g. /B/J/S/C  I agree that the
    normal weight of "Sans Serif" is really close to Futura ;)
