body: "I'm trying to get a handle of multiple master for the first time, and came
  across a huge annoyance that has me questioning my workflow. I have the black weight
  (wt1) complete and I want to design a light (wt0) so I could generate the weights
  between. When I define the new axis (wt0), I have to \"design\" the light glyphs
  by editing the copy of the black glyphs. This severely limits my usual process of
  drawing, copying and pasting segments, using the knife tool, etc. I can't work that
  way, or else it ruins wt1.\r\nIs there a way around this?\r\n\r\nI know the point
  is to maintain the exact number of points, etc. Is there any way I can tell FontLab
  \"Hey, I promise the points will be compatible when I'm done, so relax!\""

  body: "This is a limitation of the way multiple master fonts work in FontLab. There
    is really only one path for each part of a glyph. The different masters are variations
    of that path, not separate paths. If you remove or add a node to a path in one
    master, the same will happen in any other masters, since they are really the same
    path.\r\n\r\nYou might want to start with single master fonts, and then use the
    Add Master command to combine them into a multiple master font when you are happy
    with the separate masters. It is up to you to make sure the paths are compatible
    if you work this way.\r\n\r\nI've simply adapted to working with the limitations.
    I draw one master and then edit the others as needed, avoiding doing anything
    that would affect the other masters."

    have to worry about MM limitations and housekeeping, just keep the outlines compatible."

  body: "You can build your files individually and then use the Blend Fonts tool to
    build a MM file to do your interpolations from. \r\nTwo things to note: You have
    to make sure your nodes match manually (or use Prepolator) and Fontlab gets confused
    by glyphs built from multiple components (just flip the component order, ie. if
    your top component is first in master 1, make it second in master 2)."

  body: "Agree with Mark, There's really no way around it for now.\r\n\r\nOne way
    I've used for a while is to experiment with the other new weight in a separate
    file until you're fairy happy. Then you import it into the mask layer in the \"new\"
    MM weight to be produced. From there it's pretty easy to change the curves according
    to the mask and then make final adjustments to correct horizontal strokes versus
    vertical stems. It has worked fine for me.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    and Superpolator it's almost a joy.

  body: "Jos,\r\n\r\nThe backside of using to many advanced programs, is that it takes
    away the last tiny bit of \"hand made\" feeling.\r\nOver the years I've got the
    feeling typefaces are too perfect and smooth these day. Even if the design itself
    is\r\ngood looking the feeling of \"too perfect\" shines through somehow. Therefor
    I've gone back to trusting my eyes\r\nmore, rather than guidelines and numbers.
    This is of course just my personal reflection. The nice thing about\r\ntype design
    is that there are so many ways of doing it right! ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers"

    think\u2014 that can often also be achieved by breaking the regularity of a design.
    That might indeed be another way of doing it right ;)\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind
    compliment. I always had (and still have) a weak spot for your Anziano."

  body: Thanks for the responses, all. I'm not ready to jump into any other third
    party software. Plus, I doubt there's anything out there for PC. So for now I
    will make weights in different files to combine them later.

  body: in a separate vfb file, draw the glyph the way you want it, making sure that
    the outline is compatible with the original black glyph. when you're done, go
    to the original glyph window. hit control (or cmd) + h. paste you new glyph in
    the mask layer (making sure there is nothing else in the mask. hit ctrl/cmd +
    h again. hit ctrl/cmd + j. if asked to insert nodes, choose the 'no' option. voila!
    you're on your way. that's just one work around. it's a bit tedious, but it sometimes
    beats the alternative...

  body: I use "Assign Mask" instead of pasting individual glyphs into the mask layer.
    But I agree, "Mask-to-Master" is a better way to go than "Blend".
