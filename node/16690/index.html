Mrs Eaves is poorly spaced; and a person who sees
and admits that is better off than one who doesn't.
But I do wish somebody would respace it, since its
black forms are quite nice, especially in the italic.

Perhaps you'd be a little less dyspeptic towards other people's type designs (with the exception of Legato, of course) if your own were commercially successful -- but that's impossible if they're not on the market. Please, publish Patria, give us all a break, and make this corner of the world a more pleasant place.</div>

Nick, why is it so hard to admit there's a problem? Puppy love? Your hypersensitive idolatry of Licko is quite strange, especially at your age, especially a decade after it's no longer fashionable. And I know how important fashion is to you. But most of all I think it's misplaced because your work is better!

The war is over if you want it? I guess you don't want it. To me, the war is natural, it just has to be balanced. And most of all, when you see something good/bad enough to point out, you do so. Mrs Eaves is a prominent font, so it naturally gets extra attention; the more it's used by indiscriminating designers, the more people like me will point out the beautiful blonde's speech impediment.

Commercially successful? Maybe I should become a prostitute.
But then I can't have people like Nick thinking I'm untouchable.

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, loose spacing actually muffles spacing flaws. And, as you say, loose spacing actually helps at smaller sizes. But -unlike other Emigre fonts- Mrs Eaves isn't just loose, it's erratic. Robin Kinross has equated Mrs Eaves to a loose bicycle!  :-)

Anyway, back to trying to help Coral*:
If you must use Mrs Eaves, maybe something like Futura would pair well?

* What a nice name btw.

> isn’t Mrs Eaves a step child of Baskerville?

So their relationship wasn't only adulterous, it was also incestuous?! Kidding. Mrs Eaves is basically a highly personal revival of Baskerville (which to me is generally a more worthwhile thing that a literal revival).

It's almost cold here in Seattle. Lately I keep on having to think about whether or not to put the top up on the convertible. (Usual rule: put it up if there's precipitation and/or it's below freezing. But occasionally I wimp out at slightly warmer temperatures.)

I've always had a liking for Mrs. Eaves, but I find it really difficult to use, the caps seem oversize compared to the l/c characters; this has put me off using it - if this isn't sounding stupid already, then this will - is there a good way to set Mrs. Eaves? Should I try to kern in to compensate, I can't seem to get it looking right!

I really admire the character of the face, it's got lots of personality, it just bugs me somehow whenever I try to use it, I can't quite put my finger on the problem.</div>

No. A good reason for that would be that customers would have hated the resultant reflow of any old documents. A bad reason would be hubris.

Grant, TUG's Baskerville will be: freely available; freely modifiable (with some provisions concerning "officialness"); and a mix of convention in the Roman and innovation (blasphemy?) in the Italic (but don't fear, it's not a slanted-roman or anything).

Thomas, last year I left the top of my convertible (the one I had before this one - remind me to tell you the story of how the previous one died) open day-and-night (no garage) for 13 weeks straight. And when you turn on the heater, isn't the feeling of hot air rising and dissipating from your feet to your (cold) head just surreal?

> is there a good way to set Mrs. Eaves?

About 18 point, one line at a time, spaced manually.

> I would have thought the best companion for Mrs Eaves would be Mr Eaves?

You mean Richard? The bastard jumped ship.
But Mr Richard would still be a great name for a font.

Tiff, Sarah was still married when she started living with JB.
But probably because divorce law in the UK back then was nasty.
On the other hand, I'm all for discouraging divorce to some
extent: it makes marriage more serious. Anyway, as you were.
