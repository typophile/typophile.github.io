  as designers, especially those whom are involved in product design, we do have the
  responsibility to be involved and to educate. Perhaps I am blowing things out of
  proportion, but in this instance I doubt it. <BR> <BR>Quoted from an e-mail sent
  by Francois-Xavier Nsenga <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>
  <BR> <BR>Dear Colleagues, <BR> <BR>Several hundreds of ex-patients in hip surgical
  wards in Quebec <BR>hospitals are soon being recalled for investigation of an eventual
  <BR>contamination by HIV and other infectious diseases, due to a badly <BR>sterilized
  surgical instrument. The whistle was recently blown by an <BR>employee in one hospital
  sterilization department, signaling that the <BR>particular instrument is currently
  not being properly sterilized, <BR>simply because it is not, as it should normally
  be, completely <BR>disassembled after use. <BR> <BR>One of the interviewed PR medical
  doctors showed us last evening in <BR>public media the incriminated instrument,
  and <BR>declared: &#34;...obviously,  there is no way one could know that this <BR>head
  - of the instrument - is detachable ...&#34; <BR> <BR>The employee in the sterilization
  department found out, by chance,  <BR>probably through routine manipulation, that
  the head of the <BR>instrument could be removed, and all components thoroughly sterilized
  <BR>separately. <BR> <BR>One is thenn tempted to conclude that no competent design
  work was <BR>done at the successive life phases of the instrument use, &#34;from
  the <BR>cradle to the ...&#34;. Quite obviously there has been incomplete design
  <BR>input in the early briefing phase and at the drawing board or <BR>software designing
  phases. One could add also that no full design <BR>supervision has been ensured
  during the manufacturing process of the <BR>instrument, and definitely no design
  intervention at the time of <BR>multiple government inspections and approval procedures.
  Had research <BR>and practice designers been adequately trained to &#34;sell&#34;
  their <BR>expertise to medical equipment vendors and government approval <BR>officials,
  to hospital purchasing agents and medical personnel <BR>training teams, most probably
  the whole present mess would have been <BR>avoided, or at least the damage greatly
  limited. <BR> <BR>We are told the surgical instrument has been in use for a couple
  of <BR>years without proper sterilization, and it is believed it has been <BR>sold
  and used not only here in Quebec but surely elsewhere in Canada <BR>and in other
  countries. One of the expected outcomes is the financial <BR>disbursement that will
  be estimated in millions of dollars after <BR>legal responsibilities and indemnification
  will be ascribed. But <BR>there also are inestimable social effects &#40;increasingly
  diminished <BR>confidence of citizens in public institutions&#41; and emotional
  <BR>catastrophes resulting from the agonizing anguish of all those <BR>individuals
  who might have been &#40;or not!&#41; infected and having &#40;or <BR>fear of!&#41;
  spread the deadly diseases to loved ones. <BR> <BR>Another case for reflection by
  all of us, each from our respective <BR>sub-fields of design involvement. <BR><!-/quote-!><hr
