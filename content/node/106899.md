  body: "An excellent modern interpretation Neutra Display is closer to your picture
    than futura but not all the Caps have a lowered and aligned crossbar like the
    characters in \"Knickerbocker.\" It's the \"B\" that makes me think this was drawn
    specifically for the hotel. So I'm not sure if the exact font is available digitally.
    But you could also consider Kessel 205 or Transat. Any of the fonts could be a
    starting point for you redraw them.\r\n\r\nWhat you are looking for is a low-waisted
    Art Deco typeface. Check out some interesting examples here...\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/transat/\r\n\r\nAnd
    here are links to the fonts I mentioned above...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface/viewfonts\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/talbot/kessel-205/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/transat/"

  body: "The $3 price for top rate hotel suggests this is a 1930s ad.\r\nMany ads
    before WW II used lettering, but I can't decide if this was the case for this
    one. The ad uses at least 4 sizes of letters but the repeating letters within
    each size do not show any differences -- at least to my eye. The differences between
    letters in different sizes are not a factor. In the metal type era different sizes
    often had different designs.\r\nFutura was released in 1927-28 and has influenced
    the design of many fonts. The letters in the ad are clearly based on Futura --
    pointed vertices on A, W and splayed M, points on the N diagonal, G right side
    curved with inward bar, etc. But there are some differences, in addition to the
    low waist line,  -- tail on Q, tips on C.\r\nMy references to not show it as a
    font from the 1930s, but that does not mean that it did not exist.\r\nI do know
    that while I have seen digital fonts with low waistlines, such as the ones suggested
    by Robert, I do not recall ever having seen this one.\r\nRelatively easy to make
    from Futura.  Hints -- flip the B and adjust top bowl to match the bowl on R etc.
    S flip. Tinker a little with some details.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaLowWaistSM_4248.jpg]\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: 'Wasn''t able to find a name either. Agree with Don, that''s very ''Futura''
    even if flipping some letters would be very smart alternative, too many differences
    remain to me (low bowled /R, / C oblique terminals...). It also reminds me of
    this [[http://typophile.com/node/104618|previous discussion]] about a historic
    Chicago signage typeface, neither giving the answer unfortunately. So only "more"
    alternatives here: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bernhard+gothic|Berhnarf Gothic]]
    (close overall design, all terminals off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/kabel|Kabel]]
    (quite close too and specially [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kabel|Linotype''s]]),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel|Nobel FB]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar|Erbar]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/semplicita-pro|Simplicita]] (probably
    the effortless solution, following Don''s trick of flipping letters but may be
    too clean/modern), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova|Mostra
    Nuova]] Alternate D (ready-to-go option, not matching but pretty spot on in term
    of vintage feeling)'

  body: As usual, great find, Don! Also happy it confirms my suggestion of Erbar as
    alternative in my previous post. This original version differs quite a lot from
    the URW's actually. Looks like they decided to remove all earmarks from the original
    drawing.

  body: "Thank you Ryuk. \r\nUnfortunately this is not the only instance where creative
    designs were later toned down to a much less interesting version in an attempt
    to increase sales by the foundries. I suspect URW simply digitized what was then
    available. This \"extra garnish\" version did not survive long. This homogenizing
    treatment was also given to Futura. I believe there are others but I can't recall
    them offhand.\r\nDon"
