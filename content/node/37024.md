body: "I've come across a typeface that I just can't figure out -- a rarity after
  a year and a half of serious Typomania. I've seen it in a number of other contexts
  and have always been struck by it, so I thought I'd finally see what it is. The
  most characteristic aspects to me are the asymmetrical sliced arms of the E and
  the sharply pointed vertices. It reminds me of Nobel, Agenda, Verlag, etc. Any help
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/How Humans

  body: 'Looking at Bernhard Gothic, it does seem awfully close -- perhaps too close
    to be something different. But the different weights show different permutations
    of the letterforms: so the W from the Heavy matches, but the M from the Medium
    fits better. Also, Bernhard Gothic has a slight calligraphic twinge (as in the
    curved endings of the E''s arms as opposed to the perfectly angular ones in my
    sample). Hmmm.'

  body: 'Oops: on close inspection, the letters in my sample do have <em>slightly</em>
    flared terminals. Looking at the R in the MyFonts PDF, my sample is obviously
    Bernhard Gothic. Thanks a ton -- glad I got that off my chest.'

    that it's Bernhard Gothic.
