body: We are about to invest in one or two new printers for our agency. A problem
  we have had with printers in the past is that type gets printed a bit too heavy,
  especially on color printers. We have specifically been looking to resolve this
  problem with no good results. We've tested out Xerox, Canon and some others on the
  laser side of things and Epson ink jets. They all print type too thick. Has anyone
  had experience with this or a solution to this problem? The dealers all say that
  they have never had this problem before, although when we demonstrate it then they
  can also see it. Thanks!

    people who manufacture books, not the little machines you use to make hard copies
    of memos. "Ich bin Drucker," not "Ich bin ein Drucker."

    too dark; lasers, including color lasers, should work well. Type printed directly
    from InDesign is always a little pixely; type printed from a PDF is always a little
    grey (unless you're using a color printer or have made it a \"rich black\" swatch)."

  body: "Thanks Joshua. Well here is exactly our experience. We have had an old HP
    Color Laserjet 5500 for years now. We also have an HP Black and White LaserJet
    2300. Type on printouts from the 5500 are typically too fat, so that a regular
    weight  looks like a demi weight for example. On the 2300 the type is more accurately
    reproduced thought not perfect. We assumed that this was something specific to
    the HP. So we are looking to buy a new color printer and have tried out a bunch
    with samples. The printers with the best general quality: Xerox and Canon, also
    give the worst results with type, making them fatter than they should be just
    like the HP does. Interestingly we tried out an Oki. This had a pretty poor quality
    in general but the type wasn't artificially fattened.\r\n\r\nSo then we thought
    we would get an Epson in addition to a color laser. So we checked some proofs
    we got from our printer. Again the type was fatter than it should be. We hadn't
    noticed it before since we were otherwise using them only to check color. So this
    is a big problem when you are trying to develop a CD for a company. I can't believe
    nobody else has this problem. I would think that it is universal.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way Mojo, ick bin ein Berliner. I'm an American living in Berlin since forever,
    so I know that problem very well."

  body: I haven't necessarily used the brands or products you mention. The general
    approach to printers is to have a B&W laser for type and a color inkjet for photos
    etc. I think your problem may be that you're looking at "laserjets" (a hybrid?)
    rather than straight lasers. I'm not sure what exactly a laserjet is though, so
    maybe I'm wrong. I use a Canon B&W laser printer with very good results, as well
    as an older (Brother?) laser printer. By the way, you still haven't said what
    software you're printing from.

    I wouldn't say the type was an exact match to what I eventually get from offset

  body: "I have a Canon multifunction inkjet printer (I think it's some kind of Pixma),
    and I've recently made two discoveries that might be common knowledge to those
    in the know, but may be helpful for the self-taught like myself:\r\n\r\nWorking
    in InDesign, I'd always chosen \"Document\" instead of \"Proof,\" in the printing
    dialog, because in my mind \"proof,\" equated with \"draft,\" as in something
    lower quality than I wanted. My recent brilliant discovery is that what \"proof\"
    actually means is \"simulate printing press results.\"\r\n\r\nIn the printing
    dialog (in InDesign), in the Advanced menu, there is a checkbox for \"print as
    bitmap\" which seems to be on by default. Turning that off seems to improve the
    quality of the printed type quite a bit. \r\n\r\nThose two changes, plus going
    into the printer's own print dialog to make sure it was set to plain paper/high
    quality, vastly improved the quality of my proofs. The color on the plain paper
    is still a little washed out, but proofing onto matte photo paper will pump up
    the colors closer to what you'll get with a laser printer (and inkjet can deal
    with some subtleties better than laser printers, I think).\r\n\r\nWhen I was in
    college I had a $50 hp printer that I bought at target in desperation. I printed
    a picture of a large etching onto 4 pieces of matte photo paper and taped them
    together on the back to make a whole. I brought it in to class and showed it to
    my printmaking teacher who, at first glance, mistook it for an actual etching.
    Even when it was clearly not an etching, no one believed that it was made by an
    inkjet till I turned it over and showed them the tape. That same printer pumped
    out the ugliest jaggedy black text you could ever imagine. So, I don't know, printers
    and the layers and layers of software and drivers you have to slog through, remain
    pretty mysterious to me. "

  body: "Hey Joshua, We print directly from Creative Suite but have also tried converting
    to PDF and printing from Acrobat. Doesn't seem to make a difference. The HP LaserJets
    are straight up laser printers. \"LaserJet\" is just their brand name. As I mentioned,
    we do end up testing type on our black and white laser machine. I was just hoping
    that there might be a better solution to this problem. We've pretty much decided
    to get a new Epson 4900 with EFI rip and built in spectrophotometer (in addition
    to a new color laser printer). So maybe there is some adjustment that can be made
    on the Epson to get good results. If you are interested I can keep you posted
    on our results. With the high resolution and the many kinds of paper you can use,
    there ought to be something that will work. For the laser printer we will probably
    go for some kind of multifunction model. Unless someone posts here with the secret
    to printing great type with a color laser device. Actually I don't really care
    if it's a laser or an inkjet, just as long as it accurately reproduces the type
    weight.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone else for your suggestions. You have to understand
    that this is a very specific problem for when you are trying to make decisions
    about type weights. It makes it difficult if you are testing with devices that
    make the type artificially fat."

  body: "True Postscript vs. Postscript emulation also makes a dfference. I have a
    true Postscript monochrome Xerox Phaser 4510, and two Postscript-emulating HP
    color laserjets. Text on the HP printers always comes out heavy. Text on the Xerox
    is accurate (by accurate, I mean it is a very close approximation of the text
    color once it has been offset printed on coated paper). For font proofing, I rely
    on the Xerox for accuracy, but I rely on the HPs to show me what office users
    are likely to see. \r\n\r\nI used to have a Lexmark color printer \u2014 it was
    Postscript-emulating but still had very sharp text output. Unfortunately it also
    consumed toner <strong>way</strong> faster than the specifications predicted,
    so it had to go."

    also came out heavy. Well, we are going to the Xerox showroom on Thursday so we'll
    see what happens.

  body: "The cheaper Phaser printers are not true Postscript. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you're
    looking at color printers, Xerox sells both toner-based and solid-ink printers,
    which I'd expect to print text differently.\r\n\r\nSo you'll want to look at the
    same documents coming through different printers.\r\n\r\nThe one flaw on my Phaser
    4510 is that while it comes out of sleep mode quickly to print, the output is
    pale. Once the machine prints a few pages and warms up, the toner coverage gets
    deeper. So if you're making test prints off a cold printer, make multiple copies."

  body: "Well we went to the Xerox shop. They are called XFaktor and claim to be specialized
    in the design/advertising market. The guy was certainly really well informed and
    was aware of the problem. He showed us an amazing multifunction machine called
    the 550. It had really impressive color calibrating features. But it cost about
    20,000 \u20AC. Then we looked at the new Phaser 7800. That was also decent and
    cost around 8,000 \u20AC. We also looked at the really cool ColorQube, which is
    their solid ink product. That is really a great technology though the print quality
    still isn't as good as the traditional toner-based machines.\r\n\r\nBut all of
    them printed type too heavy. It just seems to be a limitation of the technology.
    If you want to have good color reproduction, the type is going to look fat. We
    still haven't decided but I suspect we will end up with an okay A3 office workstation
    and buy an Epson 4900 for high end. The type will probably be too fat there too,
    but it seems to be the best solution for now."
