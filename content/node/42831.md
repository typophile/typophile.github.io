body: "Funny, I could swear that I posted a quite lengthy answer to a question about
  writing \"100%\" in Korean just hours ago. Now, I cannot find a trace of the thread,
  in my own trackback or anywhere on Typophile.\r\n\r\nI think I might be responsible
  for the disappearance of the thread, because of a followup post where I unthinkingly
  used the 'less than' sign a few times, thereby messing up the html tags of the page.
  Or it might be a simple database glitch, unless someone has deliberated erased the
  thread.\r\n\r\nFor the record, two equally valid ways to write 100% in Korean are:\r\n\r\n\uBC31
  \uD37C\uC13C\uD2B8 (<em>baek peosenteu</em>; from \"percent\") and \uBC31 \uD504\uB85C
  (<em>baek peuro</em>; from \"pro\")"

  body: I was wondering where that thread went to, as well. Does one get threads deleted
    here by going too far off topic?
