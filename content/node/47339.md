body: "I really enjoy spending time in here, educating my self with the knowledge
  and guidance from you guys. I have used many hours reading threads and replies,
  and commented a few my self.\r\n\r\nI have made web design all of my life, starting
  10-years old. First in 2000 I tried Photoshop, soon to be followed by all the other
  Adobe products. It was here I started my passion for corporate ID design. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_4832.jpg]\r\n<strong>1.
  Magventure</strong>\r\n\tMagnetic stimulation.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Advanseed</strong>\r\n\tSells
  special seeds like Rucula.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Regnskabets time</strong>\r\n\tAuditor.
  The name is on Danish and is a saying like, \"The 11th hour\" but with a more threatening
  meaning. Like \"Let's settle the score\" sort of. It meant to be humorous.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.
  Kongens Lyngby haveservice</strong>\r\n\t\"Kongens Lyngby\" is a city in Denmark.
  A part of Lyngby. Translated to English it would be: \"The Kings Lyngby\". \"Haveservice\"
  means \"Garden Service\". So \"The Kings Lyngby Garden Service\".\r\n\r\n<strong>5.
  Daren</strong>\r\n\tDar\xE9n is a cleaning business. The idea was that the white
  stuff is like when you sweep.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. InOffice</strong>\r\n\tOffice hotel
  in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Advanseed</strong>\r\n\tSells special seeds like
  Rucula.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. AktieFokus</strong>\r\n\tA financial stock news firm that
  monitors stocks and brings the news to the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Giantmedia</strong>\r\n\tAn
  advertising agency.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. Intramedia</strong>\r\n\tA CMS IT comany\r\n\r\nI
  don't know why i post it - it's way too late to change any of them... well ... maby
  just because we all love logos... :-)\r\n\r\nPlease be free to say your opinion,
  whether it's good or bad... :-)"

  body: "Some of them are very nice logos, others aren't. It's always easier to criticise.
    :) So. \r\n\r\nI don't think that INOffice is a good one. It needs quite a bit
    of work, but it's a good start.\r\n\r\nDaren total is looks nice and ok but I
    don't think that's a corporate logo. At least not for cleaning business.\r\n\r\nEspecially
    I like the tree/crown logo. I would change it a bit to make crown and tree work
    as single image, because they look as two images at the moment, but it's very
    nice and memorable. I hope wherever it's used it has enough breathing space around.
    it's the best one of all these.\r\n\r\nOther logos/images are quite web2-ish...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
