		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m sure this has been discussed many time before. Perhaps we need an FAQ, or a database in which people can go and see which letters which designers start with. <BR> <BR>For the record, in a Latin typeface I usually start with <i>i</i>&#40;<i>l</i>&#41;<i>n</i>&#40;<i>mh</i>&#41;<i>p</i>&#40;<i>bdq</i>&#41;<i>aeg</i>. The letters in parentheses are usually roughed in as soon as I have enough related forms. My first test word is usually <i>nihilim</i>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As reckless and naive as it is, I start with &#34;a&#34; - I&#39;m not a real text face designer yet - plus I don&#39;t make numerically enough [Latin] fonts to have a solid method. After &#34;a&#34; I rough out certain letters that would be best at expressing the spirit fleshed out in the &#34;a&#34;, and I guess this depends how much character the face is to have&#42;. If it&#39;s supposed to be docile, I&#39;ll probably make the &#34;n&#34; and the other structural primitives; if it&#39;s flamboyant, I might do roughs of the &#34;g&#34; or the &#34;f&#34; or the &#34;y&#34; very early. The &#34;o&#34; I do very late, for some reason. After the roughs, I tend to go straight in and design the lc alphabet sequentially, always leaving things open for major revision. Maybe this way is slower but leaves things more open? <BR> <BR>&#42; Which makes me point out: I think we need to distinguish between text and display font design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I see it: <BR> <BR>Type design is like chemistry, biology, math and physics.  <BR> <BR>It is a chain reaction. It is an answer to the questions: What is space?

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Could you show me an example of a &#34;good&#34; italic and a &#34;bad&#34; that you have in mind? <BR> <BR>My pleasure!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s much easier to point out &#34;bad&#34; ones &#40;although I want to clarify that I find them only ideologically bad - usually they&#39;re generally &#34;usable&#34; italics, whatever that means&#41; because there&#39;s so many of them. Basically the italics that are fed an extra IV-shot of chirography &#40;hand-based design&#41; as a means of either pulling them away from the roman, or &#40;worse&#41; expressing some misplaced artistic preference, are &#34;bad&#34;. Usually this means the italic is drawn from scratch, and this generally detracts from its function as a style subordinate to the [hopefully more typographic] roman. Of course, an italic also does indeed need to stand out sufficiently from a body of roman, but there&#39;s plenty of leeway to do that without resorting to Stone Age nostalgia. BTW, an alternative, secondary italic that&#39;s highly chirographic is functionally fine &#40;although ideologicaly still a no-no&#41;. Heck, you can even make one of those now-fashionable &#34;upright italics&#34;, but: don&#39;t pretend it works the way users need an italic to work; I think it would be better to call that a &#34;cursive roman&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for &#34;good&#34; ones, they&#39;re very rare. I notice one once in a blue moon, but an italic that I&#39;ve admired for a while is Octavian&#39;s&#42;. Although it&#39;s still a bit too chirographic for my tastes, at least it matches its roman in that, so it doesn&#39;t use chirography as a drag queen outfit. Also, although I don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread, but I have tried to express my ideal-italic theories in my own work, specifically Patria&#42;&#42;. It still needs some effort before it&#39;s ready &#40;like optical slant correction, and length adjustment in some serifs and beaks&#41; but I&#39;m proud of the fact that the outlines are in fact mathematically derived from the same source as the roman &#40;with some subsequent adjustment&#41; but people still think it&#39;s usable &#40;unlike the Morison stuff&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml</a> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html" target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html</a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am amazed at Hrant&#39;s statement about good and bad italics. <BR> <BR>Is not a slanted roman really an oblique? And I thought a true italic was really a seperate design that in modern type compliments a roman in weight and color ...etc. <BR> <BR>I think of a slanted roman as a &#39;bad&#39; italic, as it adds nothing to the family/face and is more a product of digital bastardization than actual design. <BR> <BR>As too renaming italics as cursive romans - well, that kinda ignores historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing, no? So, why not leave that alone? Why rename something that is aptly named and is correct in its lable? <BR> <BR>One could argue that romans should have no italic, as italics historicaly stood on their own. But to say that only slanted romans are useful and good seems a bit of a stretch to this amatuer type guy. <BR> <BR>Hrant, maybe I am misunderstanding your comments. Would you care to elaborate? <BR> <BR>Tanks! <BR> <BR>BTW, I am a terriable speller - do we have a spell check on the forum??? If not, thank you for your patience with my lack. <BR> <BR>;&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I think you should made a disctinction between counter forms and position of the thickest/bolder part on the letters.</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, this is a very good point, and it is interesting to look over the illustration above while concentrating on the counter axis. There is less variation in the counter axis of the o and other letters than is apparent when one looks at the modulation of the whole letter. There are also, though, some surprises: the axis of the counter of the Calisto o is actually rotated slightly <i>anti</i>clockwise compared to the d. Never noticed that before.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, I agree that mechanically slanted romans suck. Morison&#39;s mistake was that he failed to temper his ideology with design sense &#40;probably because he had none of the latter&#41;. What I&#39;m advocating is non-chirographic italics, which isn&#39;t the same thing at all. It is counter to the essence of typography to use chirography to differentiate two styles, just like romans themselves can be more or less chirographic &#40;and I think the latter are weaker&#41;. <BR> <BR>Such an italic can even be drawn seperately than the roman, as long as it harmonizes <i>in its subordinate role</i>. The primary contemporary function of an italic is to emphasize words in a body of roman - that&#39;s how users use the stuff. And all an italic really needs to perform this primary funciton is slant &#40;although lighter color and other divergences can help too, especially if the slant is slight&#41;. Any other use of an italic &#40;such as for an independent body of text&#41; is strictly secondary. That at least isn&#39;t dogma, it&#39;s pragmatism. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think multiple italics are a great idea. <BR> <BR>&#62; it adds nothing <BR> <BR>You could say it&#39;s not supposed to add anything, it&#39;s just supposed to not detract from functionality. An italic that&#39;s more chirographic than its roman diluted the focus of the overall design. <BR> <BR>&#62; cursive romans <BR> <BR>I meant that only in reference to what&#39;s called &#34;upright italics&#34;, like in Seria and Unibody. I have no problem calling slanted italics &#34;italics&#34; &#40;as long as they&#39;re not merely obliques&#41;, not least because a new term would confuse things! But I think &#34;cursive roman&#34; is a better description for upright italics, simply because slant is the primary determinant for the <i>user</i>, who as a layman has no idea about chirographic versus typographic structures &#40;certainly not consciously&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing <BR> <BR>1&#41; What&#39;s more important, the past or the future? <BR>2&#41; Hey, romans came from there too! But now they&#39;ve broken free &#40;although still not enough, yet&#41; - so let&#39;s do the same favor for italics. <BR> <BR>&#62; to say that only slanted romans are useful and good <BR> <BR>I was careful to say that chirographic italics can be -and are- &#34;useful&#34; to many -probably most- people. <BR>But there&#39;s a difference between what the masses casually choose versus how culture progresses. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant - thank you for making a distinction and clarifying your argument. I wondered if I had not quite understood the essence of what you were saying. <BR> <BR>I would also agree that usage should be a primary conscern when designing, so an italic should be valued for its ability to do its job. <BR> <BR>But, having said that, I would argue that something that has proven successful for hundreds of years is rooted in useability. Maybe not always, but a high percentage of successful design is based on historical evolutions. <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking the time to explain.</div>
