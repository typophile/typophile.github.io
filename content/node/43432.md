body: "Who does graphic design in Italy??\r\n\r\nI'm finishing up my design degree
  at the Ontario College of Art & Design in Toronto and on recent visits have fallen
  in love with Italy, the language, the colors, food, etc. I'd love to move there,
  but I have had difficulty finding current graphic design firms that I might pursue
  for employment. I was hoping yall could supply some names of people and/or websites
  to start research.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: You might want to try offering yourself to companies as an in house. If you
    have an impressive enough portfolios and you find the right people who make enough
    money but could benefit from better branding or a better campaign then that's
    a really comfortable job.
