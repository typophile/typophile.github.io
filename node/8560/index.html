		<div class="commentbody">Didn't morrison once said: 'if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it'. Isn't that the whole point/dilemma we have as typedesigners? If we put to much charateristics into a typeface, to make it recognizable for example, readability often suffers. <BR> <BR>On top of that: <BR>I once had a discussion my grandpa about the need of new typefaces and typography. His answer was *Why bother?*  <BR>Isn't that an important point as well? People prefer taking the way with the least of friction, commercialization is making the mass lazy and indifferent. <BR>Why buy fonts, if you have 20 preinstalled?  <BR>Or: if people have to read stuff, they will read and buy it! Even if its giving them a headache because of the bad typography and it looks so , you wouldn't even wipe your arse with it? (newsletter, technical books e.g.). <BR> <BR>But, I must be honest, I wouldn't know how re-educate the mass! Even if Apple, Micro$ and Linux (to name the big ones) would preinstall our favorite 10 typefaces, would the standard reader tell the difference? And after 1 year those 10 faces will have been used so often, that most type designers will discuss about the same topic as we do now&hellip;&hellip;.again. <BR> <BR>Is this maybe an endless discussion? <BR> <BR>Jacques <BR> <BR>Ps: please don't think I'm a fatalistic guy. I will design type till I drop, even if people don't buy them. Its all your head&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it <BR> <BR>That's not 100% true (but what is?&hellip;): <BR>1. There are different layers of transparency, and those who take the Morison doctrine too seriously only see one layer, and as a result they think that something is either readable, or worthless. For one thing, there is a difference between the conscious appreciation versus the subconscious effects of type. <BR>2. It's not inconceivable that a reader can consciously appreciate a letterform, and this could add to the experience*. Yes, this ruins immersion during reading, but immersion isn't everything. <BR> <BR>* And reading -like anything else humans do- is an experience, not just some data-collection task. Tasks are for computers. <BR> <BR>&gt; *Why bother?* <BR> <BR>Good question. Increasingly, type design is about personal satisfaction, not some glorious role in society. <BR> <BR>&gt; would the standard reader tell the difference? <BR> <BR>Not consciously (and in part, they shouldn't anyway).

For example, Times was great for its original target reproduction conditions, but when its digital form is printed today, it might look OK on a laser printer (with the associated &quot;ink&quot; gain), but in high-quality offset it's too light, and too contrasty. So, which one do we judge? <BR> <BR>In the end, we end up having to ask: what *is* Times?

I don't know any type designer that isn't fluent in their own language and that of typography - they couldn't do that job otherwise. Considering the colision of likely letter pairs isn't really an issue, because type designers consider *all* letter pairs (ie you make up test sheets of all posible combinations, which in the age of the intercap would include cap-lower-cap sets). <BR> <BR>The only linguistics that may come into this process are whether a certain pair may be &quot;useful&quot; or whether a ligature is worth making (ie fffl does occur in German, but because of the grammar/structure used wouldn't be set as a four character ligature). <BR> <BR>That's for Western European Roman anyway. Where designers are unfamiliar with accented characters in Central/Estern European they would seek help and reference from people with more knowledge in those areas. The same is true of those I have known who have completed Greek or Cyrillic versions of their fonts. <BR> <BR>However, the questions here are not of linguistics, but of established style and practice. <BR> <BR>As to Michael's original question, yes of course you should look at any typeface that you are developing in a composed form. It's so easy to do today that I'm amazed that one would even consider not doing so. <BR> <BR>The point of a typeface in the end is not to define individually perfect looking letters - because you must end up compromising on that anyway - but to develop a set of characters that work well together in text (or display). <BR> <BR>Building a typeface character by character is as flawed as stealing parts out of the GM plant and trying to build a Cadillac bit by bit over time (ie the trunk of a '57 with the fender of a '63&hellip;)</div>

There will of course be a whole slew of Swedish type users who neither know nor care about this preference to differentiate accent use in Swedish. And I doubt that anyone setting German in Sweden will actually take the trouble to set their Swedish text in the prefered style and the German in a different style - ie it cannot be linguistic if they would do the same with other languages. <BR> <BR>Also, you'll have experience of different punctuation prefences for region or languages, or just ignorance (French setting leaving spaces before some terminal punctuation, some putting double spaces after a period&hellip; some using three periods instead of an ellipsis :-)) - which are stylistic rather than linguistic. <BR> <BR>Or, for instance, some using &quot;oe&quot; or &quot;ae&quot; ligatures rather than two separate characters, or umlauat over the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;naive&quot;. <BR> <BR>(Or Swiss-German not using [germandbls].) <BR> <BR>So, no I don't say that Mr Carter is wrong, but that it's a stylistic rather than linguistic issue. <BR> <BR>Either way it is something readily accomodated with modern type systems.</div>

The question is: for how encompassing an audience does one wish to design?

If you look back, you'll see that most of the dangling questions are *mine*. I ask a lot of questions, yes. I like it. <BR> <BR>&gt; Will you not simply write what you think *the* issue is, I do not see the point in these riddles.  <BR> <BR>Questions are a great way to realize something. I'm asking a certain string of questions because I want *you* (and others) to see my point through the questions (instead of me pounding it out). I want you guys to verbalize why Syntax's &quot;the&quot; is poorly spaced, because if it comes out of the mouth of the person complaining (me), it's not as credible or convincing.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I can't help but notice how posting in general on other threads has slowed markedly since these offensive Anonymous posts began. <BR> <BR>Indeed. And this is the typical pattern. On one other list the offender got increasingly rabid, eventually getting expelled, but was allowed to rejoin upon promising to refrain from personal attacks. Unfortunately, he picked up right where he had left off, and it took many more months of increasingly vicious attacks (including accusations of rape) for him to be expelled again. The worst part is that the entire process took over a year, during which many people ran away and the list was basically useless, and even now it's still pretty sickly. And in that case nobody was even anoymous&hellip; <BR> <BR>So, why does this happen? Clearly some people get so infuriated by certain people that trying to destroy them becomes a very important part of their lives, and for them sabotaging a public area which the reviled person frequents becomes a viable course of action. This is fundamentalist thinking - &quot;just blow it up&quot;. And anonymity helps the cause a great deal. <BR> <BR>I think this forum is very valuable, and has quickly come to play an important role; the Critique area for one is a unique gem in the font world. As much as I hate censorship (and believe me I can handle any ASCII attack, with a smile), I feel there are &quot;singularities&quot; which have to be dealt with as exceptions, to preserve overall health. And I've come to question the value of anonymity: in *practice*, how many of the anonymous posts here have been more than just part of a smear campaign? I think maybe 2. <BR> <BR>Idea #1: Show the IP address for anonymous posts (MyFonts does this - but only part of the address). <BR> <BR>Idea #2: Anonymous posts would be allowed, but screened for offensive/deceptive content. Yes, it's subjective, and yes, it's more work for the Typophile crew, but it might be a much needed compromise. In any case, to me things are pretty clear now (again&hellip;), and the clearer things are, the sooner you act the better. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tend to agree with the previous post. I'm not at all sure that anonymous posting is necessary on a forum such as this. After all, this isn't the witness protection program; nobody is putting him- or herself in danger by posting an opinion or critique on type (and if for some reason they are, then perhaps they shouldn't be posting to a public forum in the first place). <BR> <BR>We've certainly seen the abuses in the past few days, from personal attacks to identity fraud to threats against the board itself. <BR> <BR>A &quot;nom de pixel&quot; or screen name should be protection enough for anyone who resists posting under his/her own name. <BR> <BR>44 more lira from me.

But &quot;to err is human&quot;, and sometimes it's hard for otherwise rational people to separate the &quot;pure&quot; idea from the source, resulting in inferior discussion.
