<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>indesign users: y'all remember how easy it was to make global changes to kern pairs in qxp -- i've spoken w adobe reps & they assure me that indesign will NOT have this feature in any future revs. this means that altering kern pairs has to be done at the font level, thus: <br>1. leave indesign app <br>2. turn off font in suitcase or other font manager <br>3. open font in font editor <br>4. make change(s) to font's kern pairs <br>5. turn font back on in font manager <br>6. return to indesign & get back to work. <br> <br>am i missing something? can anyone offer a better method? this seems way too time-consuming and troublesome. <br>HELP! <br> <br>thanks much, folks.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">

<div class=commentbody>I think Adobe is hoping to perfect optical kerning so you <br>don't have to worry about kern pairs... sounds foolish, <br>but that seems to be their direction.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's not so foolish. Spacing is a 99% technical thing (at least for text), so a really smart algorithm could do it fine. In fact, the current one in InDesign does better than 90% of type designers. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Optical kerning has worked pretty well for me thus far with body text. Headlines sometimes require manual tweaking...but nothing major. I'm not sure I would screw around with a font's metrics to correct something that could be fixed in InDesign.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant said... <br> <br>"It's not so foolish." <br> <br>I should've said, "sounds foolish to me." <br> <br>"Spacing is a 99% technical thing (at least for text), so <br>a really smart algorithm could do it fine. In fact, the <br>current one in InDesign does better than 90% of type <br>designers." <br> <br>and I suppose this smart algorithm could rely on the <br>same advanced measures that helped you arrive at <br>your percentages? ;) really though, I'm sure there is <br>some magical formulaic way to decode great kerning -- <br>but who has the formula? don't you think typographers <br>are still going to want a global override for some letter <br>combinations? if Adobe wants to steal Quark's <br>customers, maybe they should consider these <br>customers' requests. <br> <br>I really should hold judgement until I am able to work <br>further with ID (I'm still stuck with QXP here in the <br>office). the optical kerning functions that I have seen <br>are tremendous, and it really looks like a promising <br>development. at the same time, I think we need to <br>remember that there is a great deal of subjectivity to <br>this profession and incorporate that into our <br>applications.</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, then: <br>"It doesn't sound so foolish to me." :-) <br> <br>> .... your percentages? <br> <br>:-> <br>I actually use a hypercomplex proprietaty system. It's called fudging. <br> <br>> don't you think typographers are still going to want a global override for some letter combinations? <br> <br>Yeah, totally.

InDesign should get that feature." <br> <br>-- <br> <br>i specifically cornered the adobe indesign rep recently and badgered him about this. he told me in no uncertain terms that this would POSITIVELY DEFINITELY NOT be forthcoming in ANY indesign releases, which is why i started this thread in the first place. <br> <br>so ... NO ONE has any ideas? i know that i'm drawing a blank. <br>*ugh*</div>

<div class=commentbody>"so ... NO ONE has any ideas? i know that i'm drawing a <br>blank." <br> <br>sorry, I tend to drift off into discussions about the <br>question rather than delivering answers to it. I should <br>have said in my first post that I have no clue how to <br>work around this gaping hole, outside of the <br>unpleasant method you've already described. hopefully, <br>if we badger them enough, Adobe will correct this <br>mistaken decision and nab one more advantage away <br>from Quark (of which it now has very few).</div>

<div class=commentbody>maybe it could be done by a plug-in? <br>perhaps someone could contact any <br>plug-in-programmer. <br> <br>I think, it would be a useful feature - not <br>necessarily for normal Text, optical kerning is <br>very good, but for logo-fonts or special <br>characters/pi-combinations. <br>In a 500-page-book created with Corel Ventura I <br>used it for better kerning of numbers. <br>In InDesign it would be necessary to use optical <br>kerning for all the text to improve inline <br>numbers. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, this is a feature that is on the InDesign team's radar for consideration in future versions of the application. I can't comment on specific features of unannounced products, and I'm not saying it will be in the next major version, but to say that "it will positively definitely not be forthcoming in any InDesign releases" is vastly overstating the case. If it doesn't make it into the next major version, it will definitely be in consideration for the following one. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T <br> <br>Thomas Phinney <br>Fonts Program Mgr. <br>Adobe Systems</div>

<div class=commentbody>"hopefully, <br>if we badger them enough, Adobe will correct this <br>mistaken decision and nab one more advantage away <br>from Quark (of which it now has very few)." <br> <br>I can only see two advantages that Quark has, myself... market saturation and speed. InDesign really needs to be sped up because it can bog down fairly quickly.</div>
