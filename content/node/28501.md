    a given. If you do illustration and graphic design, simply send the appropriate
    variation to the potential employer. Would king of make me go 'duh!'\r\n\r\nIf
    you got rid of 'graphic design resume' I would try bringing your address line
    to a subhead level in some way.\r\n\r\nMaybe an 'objective' heading before 'work
    experience'\r\n\r\nAnd actually, the whole thing feels very left-heavy. Maybe
    reduce the  width of your column and center? Keep it flush left,more than a few
    lines feel like they want to fall off.\r\n\r\nI wonder, if you just chuck the
    ' gdr 'part and move the contact info up. It's actually a double whammy, because
    who ever is looking at it will be like, yes, you are OBVIOUSLY applying for a
    gd position, and yes, i AM looking at a Resum\xE9. So, chuck it.\r\n\r\nAnd I
    think where it says the part about online samples should go to, that's something
    that should be worked into the cover letter and removed from resume, which should
    always go out with a res.\r\n\r\nmy thoughts.\r\n\r\np.s.- where on spruce do

  body: "I'm with Eric concerning the left-heavy-ness (not only is the main text-block
    way too far left, but the caption under your name-plate is also contributing to
    the pull leftward).\r\n\r\nAlso, the whole thing feels a bit loose. There's a
    lot of breeze flowing between your headings & subheads, and between the subs and
    sub-subs, which is actually making the information clusters <em>less</em> easy
    to distinguish.\r\n\r\nHopefully this won't sound too harsh, but I suppose I'm
    wondering: if you're a graphic designer, where's the evidence in the design of
    the resum\xE9? I'm not saying you should turn the thing into a full-colour, full-bleed
    poster, but while you've used a few distinctive fonts, the layout looks a bit
    like, well, an MSWord template, and the typography is riddled with bugs.\r\n\r\nFor
    example: your work descriptions are sentences and sentences require periods. And,
    you've got small caps in your parenthetical dates, but not in the Awards listing
    (and track the small caps out a bit). And get rid of the italic on the parentheses,
    or at least kern in the right-parens. And change those hyphens in the dates to
    en-dashes. (To mention a few...)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd definitely get your contact
    info up top."

    what you're doing, right, kind of like a job title.\r\n\r\nI would also move the
    entire document to InDesign and refine it from there, not from a program like
    Word (pardon if you were designing this piece in InDesign). Pay attention to minutiae
    typographic detail, like Jason said, and also margins."

  body: "Without discussing content, I think you should re-think how the resume looks.
    It is typically the first piece an employer sees of your work. It's purpose is
    to interest the employer into wanting to see your portfolio (electronic or printed).
    To that end, this is your first chance to showcase your design skills. It should
    be as \"design-y\" as your website or your business card. \r\n\r\nRemember, any
    employer you send this resume to already has an active interest in graphic design
    and/or typography."

    chance of getting through to the next test (the interview or the portfolio) is

  body: "I usually pass on these threads.\r\n\r\nIt has been a few years since I was
    reviewing CVs and hiring people. Before my type design life I was a publications
    design director in charge of too many magazines. Here are my thoughts...\r\n\r\nDrop
    the art work at the top. Its not very good lettering, and why start off with a
    less than fabulous impression. (I always threw away resumes that looked too designed).\r\n\r\nFlesh
    out your descriptions of your previous work experience. If you had a career spanning
    a few decades, it might make sense to sum it up briefly, but I would think the
    opposite is necessary in your case. \r\n\r\nInstead of the lettering, concentrate
    on the typographic details. Show in a subtle way that you have command of typographic
    organization and hierarchy. In CV 3 the heads are too large against the body type.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\n\r\nJames"

    of the problem. I would encourage you to delete the file(s) you've been working
    on and, without looking back, build a new version from the ground up (no re-using
    the stylesheets, etc.). What was good in the latest version will stick in your
    mind, and you may come up with solutions that are invisible while staring at the
    current attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd no input on the next (new) version. At the moment
    much of the work in the lastest version is not your own (it was suggested/directed).
    Scrap it and do it solo from scratch, so that when you hand it to a potential
    employer, you'll know and feel good that what you're handing them is yours."

    I love white space, when it's clever. I think the white space on your resume comes
    across like you need more skills or something exciting on there. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    an objective would be a good idea like \"Objective: To use my talents in graphic
    design to boost the reputation and creative excitment of (Company Name). \"  That
    sucks but you get the idea. Elaborate more on your previous job duties. This is
    good practice at your advertising skills. Use fancy adjectives to make your jobs
    sound more glamorous.\r\n\r\nAlso, your business card needs work. It's boring.\r\n\r\nGood

  body: 'I used to be in management and my number one pet peeve was spelling errors
    on resumes. It gives a bad first impression (ex: "indpndent" under Thayer Academy
    unless that''s a funky title?) - plus if you do any production work, style of
    writing is as important as the typography. As a rule of thumb, when writing lists
    use the same tense, i.e. change "funding, faculty advisor, obtaining software,
    mission of class, curriculum" to something like "procuring funds, obtaining software,
    developing curriculum...". I now work as in design and production and my most
    successful interviews were gleaned from targeted resumes. If I was targeting a
    corporation, I went more clean in my layout. If it was an interactive firm, I
    kept it brief on written and sent links to my url. Be sure to show your strengths
    - and you''ll get the call.'

    that some attempt must be made to be distinctive, but is needs to be grounded
    first and foremost in doing the thing (the resum\xE9, whatever) <em>well,</em>
    rather than grasping for attention through setting \"distinctive\" as the goal.
    Don't get me wrong, I agree with Datura, in that the thing that others haven't
    thought of is simply doing the job well, but the drive to be different is too
    often viewed as the goal in itself. The phrase I use in class is \"effective yet
    understated,\" and I have to say it often because understatement seems to be a
    bad word."
