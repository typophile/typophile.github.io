  tv work.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm down to these two versions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pleppo_v1_5825.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  first one is an old tv/robot that refers to the fact that they are into media. The
  second one is some kind of robot toy with it's brains showing. This is the idea
  that they suggested in our first meeting, that they wanted something with a wind-up
  brain. I have the wind-up key in both version to suggested screwed up or screwed
  ideas, their show contains very random humour and is relatively extrem, that's also
  why I have the pink/brown colour scheme.\r\n\r\nI'm concerned about the brain on
  the second one. I think that people might not get that it is a brain.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any opinions, good or bad, feel free to comment.\r\n\r\n\r\npeter"

    after a few seconds.

    the first one being slightly stronger, but also more obvious. The second one could
    benefit from the brain being more divided (left/right brain side). Have a look
    at some standard brain illustrations to see what i mean.\r\n\r\nLooking forward
    to seeing the final artwork.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "thanks,\r\n\r\nThe next idea I had was actually to put the brain in the TV
    like Jay suggests. Didin't work as I would've hoped. It would have been a nice
    combination.\r\n\r\nI've made the brain a little brainer by dividing it in the
    middle like a real brain is.\r\n\r\nI really like the TV, like Seb said it feels
    stronger. But the brain idea is still pretty funny and quirky so I'm going to
    try and take it in a direction where I can have both."

    brain the screen.. (instead of the screen being a square or rectangular shape).
    Kind of like what you have in the fourth version you posted.\r\n\r\nI think if
    you haven't, looking at brains for real would help. your brains right now read
    more like food, something delicious to eat. Its mostly about how swirly and pointed
    the ends of your lines get. Right now the third one is working the best for me."

  body: I like the use of typeface and the little logo design, I prefer the brain
    one as it looks fresh to me instead of the tv one. tv usually resemble to media
    which is kind of generic. The brain is something new.

    The client likes the this version.\r\n\r\nThe very first idea they had was just
    a brain with a wind-up key in it. Going to try and make a version with that later
    although I don't think it will mount to much.\r\n\r\nThis dosen't have to be finished
    for another month so I can still make a lot of changes.\r\n\r\nThanks for all

    a lot of \"evil\" stuff with pepole and animals dying in some episodes and in
    some one is really mean to the other. So it's kind of a wierd horror show in some
    episodes.\r\n\r\nA smile might be to cute but I'll have to try it and see what
    it looks like.\r\n\r\nOne of them showed it to his mother and she thought it looked
    like a bowl of popcorn. I thought that was pretty funny :)\r\n\r\nThe target audience
    are boys and girls age 15-20 and it would be awesome if it turns out that the
    parents don't understand what it is but the kids do."

    This is what they wanted. The name Pleppo is also very well known among it's target
    audience and dosen't need that much logo or name branding. There are several commercial
    campaings going on that promote the site though. The site itself dosen't need
    to show the name or logo as freaquent as other sites usually do, it's not directly
    an ordinary company.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael:</em> Thanks. It's a pleasure to post
    projects on this site when you know you'll get some decent feedback."
