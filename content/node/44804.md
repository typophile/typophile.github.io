body: "Since getting Apple's iWork in December, I haven't opened Microsoft Office.
  Not once.\r\n\r\nUntil today.\r\n\r\nMy MacBook crapped out on me a few days ago,
  and now I am forced with the harsh reality of composing all of my final papers in
  Word. I am currently rewriting a paper on J.M. Coetzee's <em>Foe</em> for my English
  class, and the experience has been, shall we say, less than ideal. I thankfully
  had my papers from this semester saved in the storage that Rice gives me, so instead
  of having to re-type the entire paper, I was able to copy-paste the entire thing
  into Word. Here's where it begins.\r\n\r\nWord apparently can't interpret ligatures,
  so every instance of \"Th\" was replaced with an exclamation point. \"tt\" became
  an inch glyph, \"fi\" a percentage sign, \"ft\" an octothorpe.  I had to go through
  my entire document and figure out which instances of punctuation were misplaced
  ligatures and which were actual punctuation marks. I used the Find>Replace function,
  but Word recognizes the inch glyph as the same as quotation marks, so I had to go
  through each instance of a quote in my English paper in addition to the misplaced
  tts.\r\n\r\nThen I decided to set my paper in Hoefler Text (I was using Arno, but
  very few of this school's computers have CS3). My title is bolded, but there is
  no bold Hoefler Text on the computer I'm using \u2014 only black. Word doesn't tell
  me that. All it says is that I'm using Hoefler Text with bold option enabled. I
  decided to play around a bit, and I soon realized that Office organizes typefaces
  by hiding the bold and italic version of whatever precedes it. So I can select \"Gill
  Sans\" and \"Gill Sans Light,\" but I can't select \"Gill Sans Bold,\" \"Gill Sans
  Italic,\" or \"Gill Sans Bold Italic.\" Worse yet, if I enable the bold function
  on Gill Sans Light, Word fakes it, because it doesn't see a bold version of Gill
  Sans Light (because clearly Gill Sans Light and Gill Sans are not in the same family).\r\n\r\nI
  used to live with this, because I didn't know anything better. I had used InDesign,
  but it was a bit impractical for just writing academic papers. Since using Pages,
  which is beautiful in its simplicity and quality type management, I can't stand
  Word. I yearn for a nice drop-down menu for typeface families, with another for
  the different fonts within that family. I want a word processor that is smart enough
  to recognize that Helvetica Neue, Helvetica Neue Light, and Helvetica Neue UltraLight
  are in the same family. I want easy management of leading (although leading by points
  rather than multiplier in Pages would be nice), and goddammit I want ligatures.\r\n\r\nI
  had a recognition last week of how much Microsoft Office has hurt (or at least how
  it hasn't helped) understanding of type. I was rambling about something having to
  do with type design, which usually warrants rolled eyes from my friends, when my
  friend Kevin said, \"You know what I really like lately? Gill Sans Light.\" My initial
  reaction was, \"Hey, I like Gill Sans Light, too! My friends are finally starting
  to appreciate good type.\" But as I thought about it more, I realized that he was
  talking about Gill Sans Light as though it were its own typeface family, not as
  part of the family Gill Sans. The way Pages handles typeface families is so intuitive
  and simple that it also manages to create an understanding of how families work.\r\n\r\nI
  guess I'll have to live with Word through this week, but I'm certainly not enjoying
  it. I can't wait to get Pages back."

  body: ":) Well, just to add my bit. I once had a nasty argument with Word. You know
    the \r\ncrazy \"hide unused menu entries to simplify navigation\" feature that
    came with Word 2000 (or whichever version it was) ? It made my life much more
    difficult because suddenly the position of entries became unstable - they can
    appear anywhere (vertically in menu) or not appear at all, depending on whichever
    other entries Word decides to hide. Instead of mechanically clicking to the same
    position in menu as always, I now need to actually read the menu contents each
    time what takes unnecessary time. \r\n\r\nIt happened once that I moved my mouse
    quite fast through the whole menu in desperate search for some apparently lost
    entry (that I had been using for years before) - when a pop-up window showed up
    saying: \"Dear user, it seems you are using MS-Word for the first time. Do you
    want to watch our introductory video ?\". I answered no and continued in my search
    for the lost option. In a couple seconds another pop-up came saying \"Dear user,
    are you sure you do not want to try the introductory video ?\". I could not undestand
    my eyes. I clicked yes, I am sure I do not want to see the bloody video and moved
    on to other things. Guess what, it took just another minute or so before Word
    just defiantly launched the bloody introductory vid !! \r\n\r\nWell, now this
    is what I call the \"Artificial Intelligence to Improve User Experience\", Microsoft-style."

  body: "I'm not saying Word is wonderful, but this is most likely NOT primarily a
    Word bug.\r\n\r\n1) How are you getting the ligatures into your document? Are
    you manually inserting them in some way (and if so how?), or are you relying on
    automatic ligature formation in the application?\r\n\r\n2) If you're using automatic
    ligature formation (as I would hope/assume), then the problem most likely lies
    in what iWork is putting on the clipboard when you copy the text. It should be
    the underlying text, and apparently it is not.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Apple. So I'm concerned that without tackling the Apple issue head on he'll reach
    the acceptance and hope stage without fully facing the root cause of the problem.
    It's okay to feel betrayed and let down by Apple, it's okay.*\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n*unless
    of course the Mac was the victim of some college drinking game. "

  body: "Fair enough, Si; I actually reached the acceptance stage before writing this
    post, so Word is not a surrogate for my frustration. I wasn't shocked, because
    I've had issues with my MacBook in the past. Electronics kind of hate me. I'm
    not convinced I'd have any fewer problems with a Windows book, and I like the
    UI better in OS X (not to mention the whole loyalty thing, since I've been using
    Macs since I was 3). Also, the fact that I can bring my computer to the mall and
    get it back in working condition for free in less than a week is nice.\r\n\r\nIt
    was really hard to feel upset when my hard drive crapped out, because even though
    I've apparently lost all of my data (because I was too stupid and lazy to back
    it up and $500 isn't worth it), it couldn't have come at a better time. It was
    four hours after I had finished my last paper during regular-class-time, and I
    hadn't started any of my finals yet. I was actually thinking about wiping my entire
    hard drive and starting over.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't so much a \"Gah! Why do I have
    to use Word?\" post as a \"Hey, I never realized how much I dislike Word until
    I used Pages\" post. Right now I'm using InDesign on one of the Mac Minis in the
    library, and it's not altogether unenjoyable.\r\n\r\nAlso, Thomas, I'm not asking
    for help about a bug; this was kind of a short essay that I had worked out in
    my head, and I needed to find an appreciative audience. I tried to tell my friends
    about how much I dislike Word's type management, and they just rolled their eyes.\r\n\r\nFor
    the record, I'm blaming Facebook. I was using Facebook chat for the first time
    when my computer locked up on me."
