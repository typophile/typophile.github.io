  looks very familiar... way too familiar. At first I thought that it was Arial Narrow,
  but the \"a\", the \"y\", the \"t\" and the \"g\" to give some examples, are completely
  different.\r\n\r\nAnyone knows? Thank you ^^"

    that it had been changed to another font named \"Ultima\" which I think I downloaded
