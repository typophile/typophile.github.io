  body: Thanks for replying.  I am actually looking for a font match to the word "Cameo"
    in my sample.  Apparently I can't figure out how to place the image in my message
    for anyone to see it.  Any suggestions?

  body: this sometimes happens, bonmarie. if it does, you have to edit your initial
    post and make sure that the correct checkbox is marked so that the image will
    be attached. i did it for you this time, but so you know in the future...

      to try to hand draw something similar.  It looks like a cross between Monterey
      & Linoscript.\r\n\r\n"
