  document typography? I know document is a very vague and general term, so I shall
  explain. I am a middlewieght typographic designer working on a corporate identity
  design project - I normally stick to books -, and I would like to find a fairly
  comprehyensive guide to setting stationary items, such as compliment slips and letters.
  Can anyone help? \r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone, including the man himself, know how
  Nick Shinn uses Em dashes in his forum entries - maybe it's obvious, I don't know?
  I guess I'll have to stick to hyphens for know - yuck!"

    just type a double hyphen and it will magically turn into an em dash -- go ahead,
    try it! :-)"
