  body: "the bold version is very nice, except the \"s\" which seems stilted to the
    left.\r\nthat \"a\" looks angry! especially in light version, same thing for d,
    b and q in light version. Stroke terminals look inconsistent, for example you
    have completely vertical cut in \"z\" terminal (geometric form maybe?!) but none
    of other characters have a same kind of logic, or you have different kind of stroke
    weight in terminals. I'm not a pro and maybe these are just bullshits and I'm
    just stating what I'm perceiving, I don't have a solution . but just my opinion.

  body: "Frode: Thanks for your comment. I'm not sure about what you mean about /a/
    Can you be a bit more specific about that? \r\n\r\n\r\nBahman: You are right about
    /s/ thanks! In the case of /z/ I followed the same cut that I've chosen in the
    other two horizontal stems for the lower case /f/ and / t/ and that logic is coherent
    with the treatment in the upper case. You can see the regular here [[http://typophile.com/node/80624]]
    But, really this is my first font as i said before and if you can give me an explanation
    about what is not working I would appreciate it. Thanks Bahman!"

  body: "I promised to give you more extensive critique some time ago, so here it
    is:\r\n\r\nThe tails in p and d really look out of place to me.\r\n\r\nThe sudden
    straight cut-offs don't really work for me. \r\n\r\nWhat you did with the ascender
    of d, is also visible in Karmina Sans, but I prefer it cut off the other way around.\r\n\r\nDon't
    be afraid to make the t slightly wider, more towards the f.\r\n\r\ns in both bold
    and regular leaning backwards and topheavy.\r\n\r\nThe top of the e leans towards
    the right too much.\r\n\r\nThe top of the q needs something to make it's height
    optically equal when it's next to a /u/. Have a look at the q (and b) in Quadraat,
    bij Fred Smeijers. \r\n\r\nKeep going!\r\n"

    should make all the cuts like the top stem of /d/ , is that what you mean with
    the sudden cuts or that modulation on /d/ is not working at all?"

  body: "1. Yes all cuts on the top of stems should be like the k (k, not d).\r\n\r\n2.
    The modulation across the entire typeface doesn't work. For example the curve
    on the inside of the bowl in /d/ has one of those 'sudden cuts' where the curve
    is interupted. I would just get rid of that whole idea, but if you insist on having
    those 'sudden cuts' have a really close look at how Alexei Vanyashin incorporated
    them in his typeface. http://cyreal.org/typefaces/florian\r\n\r\n3. The tapering
    in the k (bottom right) is too much.\r\n\r\n4. Why make one stroke end at an angle
    and one stroke end straight in the z? Same for f.\r\n\r\n5. My Sensato is actually
    quite similar to this, so you might want to use it as a reference to see how I
    solved the problems you're encountering now, but bare in mind that Sensato is
    by no means finsihed and far from perfect.\r\n\r\nKeep going!"

  body: You have different scenarios for strokes. in some places one stroke starts
    with angled cut and ends with straight cut or vertical/horizontal cut, but in
    other places it doesn't. even if they are very similar forms. It seems that you
    are trying to blend some ideas from different styles or typefaces but I think
    it needs more polishing to create a united typeface. and I agree with jasper in
    case of the curve inside of the /d/ bowl, this is not a problem that you created
    that way, it makes me feel that eyebrows of the /d/ is folding and he/she is very
    angry! I wonder if anyone else noticed it or not? in the /s/ contrast got lower,
    different from contrast of the /d/ or /k/. a suggestion about presenting your
    typeface, If you upload it in black and white, the judging of the typeface would
    have been easier, color makes the expression of the letters different.

  body: /a/ number 1, very well done, I like it a lot. I don't know if there is any
    similar typeface that has this kind of /a/, but it seems new, fresh and strong
    to me. I think this might be your first idea that could grow into other characters.
    /k/ number 2 went too far and kerning needs working.

  body: "Much better already. Great improvements!\r\n\r\nThe n and alikes might benefit
    from a little smoother curve. It seems to 'sharp' compared to the other letters.\r\n\r\nI
    think you need to make the contrast between diagonals larger. In the v, for example,
    the right diagonal looks thicker to me (should be the other way around).\r\n\r\nI
    think the top of the bowl in /a/ needs to be steeper to match the top of /a/.\r\n\r\nThe
    tail in /l/ needs rethinking or removing.\r\n\r\nThe g needs more 'humanisticness'.
    It looks like you added acute joints to an otherwise 'plain' g. Perhaps shape
    it towards this g: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/artlebedev/mezzo/\r\n\r\nThe bottom
    terminal in c should end thinner, more towards a point.\r\n\r\nKeep going! You
    got something great in the making!"
