  to announce the long anticipated release of the Cyrillic extension for our award-winning
  typeface [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle|Adelle]]. As its Latin sister, [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle|Adelle]]
  Cyrillic is intended for multi-purpose editorial use, providing robustness and personality.
  To guarantee consistency throughout the two scripts they share proportions, colour
  and general features without stepping beyond typographic acceptance. Please [[http://www.type-together.com/info|contact
  us]] if you own [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle|Adelle]] and would like to
  upgrade to the Cyrillic version. \r\n\r\nMore information: [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adelle9b_5074.png]"
