body: "Obsession: A History by Lennard J. Davis\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_obsession_3830.jpg]\r\n\r\nSimplistic,
  beautiful, and striking: three words that best describe the cover of Obsession:
  A History by Lennard J. Davis.  Obsession, as one may have inferred, chronicles
  the position of obsessions in modern culture. Whether clinical or inferred, obsessions
  have become more common place today than ever before in history.\r\nThe cover of
  the book is a perfect reflection of the guts of the book; it explains everything
  before the reader views a single sentence.  In the use of the color white and the
  inferred use (through photography) of plain paper, commonness is implied.  The precision
  of the punched holes and cleanness of the paper solidifies the cover's obsessive
  nature.  These two elements come together to fortify the book's message: obsessive
  disorders and the culture of obsessions has become an overarching, almost expected
  theme of life in America."

    at the actual jacket closely you notice the pinprick holes. '
