body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nTotally off the subject of typography, but I have a question
  about PDFs.\r\n\r\nI am trying to create editable fields and am able to do so inside
  Acrobat (I'm on 8 now, but created the form back in 6). I am able to edit the fields
  myself and save the PDF, however, when I send the form out to others, some are able
  to save it and some can't. For those who can't it gives a warning \"Please fill
  out the following form. You cannot save data typed into this form. Please print
  your completed form if you would like a copy for your records.\"\r\n\r\nI know the
  IRS has forms like this online. The same people who can't save my PDF can fill out
  the IRS' and save it. So I don't know what's going on. Does anyone have any ideas
  of what I'm doing wrong or not doing at all?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n\r\nJohn"

    an older version of Acrobat or they need to upgrade their copy of Reader.

  body: "Hmmm.  Perhaps the standard questions are in order: what platform/OS version/etc.
    is she running?  We also had one person who had problems upgrading as well (there's
    one in every crowd, I guess), and I ended up having to save it as an Acrobat 5
    document, because she was on an ancient PC.  Worked then.\r\n\r\n"

    4 or 5. Thanks for the help, Linda.
