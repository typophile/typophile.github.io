  body: "Hi Chris\r\n\r\n\"CAROLE SMITH\" is <strong>Felix Titling</strong> by Monotype\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/felix-titling/\r\n\r\nThe
    script is a bit more tricky as it can be found under the following names:\r\n\r\nOPTICarmella
    HandScript\r\nJulia-HandScript\r\nCarpenter Script\r\nHemingway\r\nCarpenterICG\r\n\r\nMultiple
    rip-offs? \r\nI don't know which one is the original design.\r\nThey are all very
    similar and very close to your logo\r\n\r\nFivos"
