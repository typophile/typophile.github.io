body: Not wanting to step on anyones toes (Stephen;-) I pose the question. Is the
  fontshop website hard to use or perfect the way it is? Is it only me who find it
  slightly incomprehensive? Is this from the sheare number of fonts in their selection
  or has it something to do with the information architecture of the website? You
  tell me cause I'm not sure myself;-)

  body: It is so much improved - faster and now has keyword search too but the yellow
    has always given me a bit of a headache. I just don't like looking at it.

    the typenavigator is not optimal - I never quite find what I am after.\r\n\r\nBut
    as Pattyfab says it has improved."

  body: "Hi Endre. You're in Norway, but I assume you're referring to <a href=\"http://fontshop.com\">fontshop.com</a>,
    correct?\r\n\r\nThere are so many different ways to shop for fonts that no single
    site can perfectly meet all needs. To answer your questions, it will help to understand
    how you, Endre, look for fonts. Give me a typical scenario. Maybe I can guide
    you through the best way to navigate fontshop.com or maybe there's a better way
    to approach your search."

  body: "Yes Stephen, I read your thread on how to bypass the regional website, so
    I am referring to fontshop.com\r\n\r\nI will definetely get back to you on my
    search patterns but it'll have to wait a day: Someone got sick and all of a sudden
    I have got a hefty deadline to reach. That combined with that my search patterns
    might take some time to explain;o)\r\n\r\nThanks for dropping in on the thread
    though Stephen\r\n\r\nGotta run!!"
