  body: "> <em>Florian, who really has time to use the crappy search engine on Typophile
    anyway? No one here twisted your arm to participate either.</em>\r\n\r\nNo, but
    the FAQ specifically asks to do a Search first if you know what you're looking
    for, so Florian's remark was warranted. I think he reacted more to the <em>\"If
    I had time\"</em> remark which made me jump as well. Especially since doing a
    Google Search takes exactly 0.22 seconds, so why waste our time then? :^P\r\nLet's
    say that -- fair enough -- this time it wasn't <em>really</em> necessary, but
    we've had times that it can became very tedious answering the same question over
    and over again. There's a reason why I put that in the FAQ. ;^)"

  body: And nobody said to use the crappy search engine on Typophile -- like Simon
    said just use Google and restrict your search to site:typophile.com. Works perfect
    for me. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20pantone">See
    the fourth hit.</a> ;^)

    have no problem with id-ing, searching or advising how to search \u2013 even if
    it was one of those notorious recurrent queries \u2013 it can be great fun, otherwise
    we all won\u2019t be here, would we?\r\nYet, I might have a problem with being
    treated as if this was a paid service.\r\nWell, Ella nicely said thank you and

  body: "Every time (not sometimes, but every single time) the issue of search comes
    up it's because the user is new here. (I always check how long a user has been
    a member). As easy as it is for us, navigation is not very novice friendly on
    Typophile. Information is layers deep or overwhelming. Search is apart of that
    too (even Google). With regards to <em>\"If I had the time\"</em>... maybe she
    doesn't understand the process/mess here or she's busy or even lazy. Doesn't matter
    to me... because I have immediately took into account that Ella is new. Did anybody
    else here? Yes, Marten did when he gave her the correct answer then positively
    encouraged her to use the Google search. That's how you do it.\r\n\r\n<em>Well,
    better let others spend their time, huh? :^(</em> This question is repellent and
    not welcoming. I don't want Ella to have the impression that those who ask questions
    have to feel responsible or owe or have to answer back to us. We do it for fun.
    We are not paid. In the scheme of things Typophile is just a trivia endeavor.
    \r\n\r\nThat's why I said what I said.\r\n\r\nI will always give the newbie the
    benefit of the doubt. I will always light the rear-end of the person who doesn't
    either.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz ;-)\r\n\r\nPS... But if you spot that disruptive good-for-nothing
    Mike Diaz on here- slap him down like the street corner trash he really is! :-)"

    you can place as a bookmark in your browser to search Typophile. It prompts you
    with a little popup in which you can input search strings. The code is: \r\n\r\n<code>javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))</code>\r\n\r\n[edit]

  body: You just make a new bookmark with the line of code as the internet-adress.
    For convenience sake you can place this bookmark in the bookmark-bar in the top
    of the screen (on Firefox for example, I don't know what its called in the English
    version), so you can click on it. You can make new bookmarks via something like
    'organise bookmarks' in your browser. I only know how it works in Firefox, but
    I'm sure you'll manage if you have a different browser.
