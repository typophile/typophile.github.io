body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI need to create a logo featuring the word \"life\" predominantly.
  I need something timeless that appeals to a predominantly female audience without
  alienating men, something that says \"youthful, modern elegance\" ideally in an
  ultra-bold weight. \r\n\r\nThe letters in \"life\" look almost the same in any font
  so I'm having to get quite creative. I'm curious to see what they look like in the
  font on the attached image. Can anyone help identify it or suggest something similar?
  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance everyone. "

    reworking almost all letters or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/georgia-pro|Georgia
    italic backslanted]] (to get single storey /a and curved /i). My suggestions in
    the same vein: [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034|Sentinel]]
    (start from Black Italic, backslant it and it''s almost done ;), [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033|Archer]]
    (slab serif with ball terminals)'
