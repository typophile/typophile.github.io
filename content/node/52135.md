  an on/off project. Mainly because I find more and more (wacky) ways of writing it,
  use it as a graphic element, etc. I'm a fan of optical illusions so I tried to get
  this font working as a hommage to Reutersv\xE4rd and Escher. Well, I managed to
  get quite a bit of impossible figures into it (it's most obvious in the B), though
  not in all of them. My focus was the outline of the characters, I tried to still
  make them legible even when not filled with the 'shading'.\r\nI'm happy with it
  now and actually a bit proud to have managed to squeeze a font in the most restricting
  three dimensional grid possible.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/stakk4web_4176.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks!\r\nSo far it's not (yet) available for licensing. As I mentioned,
    I already have some very keen publishers, but couldn't get my head around the
    writing angle of 30 degrees. (They want me to sort it out...) To my knowledge,
    all fontdesign programs are adding the characters on a horizontal line. This font
    was initially made to write from top to bottom but playing with it, I found more
    and  more interesting ways of displaying it.\r\nI thought about writing a webapplication
    for it, but lack in skills. I would appreciate any ideas and/or technical hints
    that would help making the font available to the public. "

  body: The easiest way to make this work as a font is to rotate everything 30 degrees
    clockwise so that it can work on a horizontal baseline. When using the font, rotate
    the text box 30 degrees counterclockwise to get the proper effect.

    the Univers Revolved!).\r\nCurrently I'm planning a couple of lasercutting and
    -etches, but due to the optical illusions I guess it will never see the third
    dimension  ; )\r\nMark, your suggestion was actually the first I stumbled upon
    and while you've got a point, some of the characters make the kerning too difficult.
    It needs to be done on a case-by case basis to make it legible. Another point
    is that any charakter is underneath the overlapping part of its predecessor. I
    don't know if fontdesign programs support layers (and are smart enough for the
    kerning).\r\nAt the end of the day: Is it worth to go through all this pain? I
    guess noone would ever use it as copytext...\r\n\r\nIt's still good to design
    some mastheads or other products with it. Here are some skis I designed recently:\r\nhttp://www.kingswoodskis.com/home/skis-designs-klaus\r\n\r\nP.S.:

    have been produced and the font had some exposure already. It has been published
    in Los Logos 4 by Die Gestalten/Berlin.\r\nIf you are keen to get your hands on
    a pair of the skis go to Kingswoodskis.com\r\n\r\nThe font and the ski also won
    one of the BeST awards 09, so I'm pretty happy with the outcome so far.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the licensing of the font: It is on Primetype's and Die Gestalten's desk so it
    may be up and running soon.\r\n\r\nCheers, Klaus"

  body: "Hi Ophello,\r\n\r\nI agree - readability is an issue as they obscure each
    other. This happens if choosing the direction to write in a 30 degree angle upward
    direction meaning I have to set one letter behind each other, thus making it hard
    to follow. My intention was to provide a sort of a starting point to lead the
    viewer in in order to let him 'see' the font later. (unfortunately sacrificing
    readability)\r\nHowever - if I start setting the font in a 30 degree downward
    direction it is way easier to recognise as such and readability increases. The
    characters still obscure each other but the mind seems to fill in the gaps. I'll
    post a sample if I find the time\u2026 \r\n\r\nCheers, Klaus\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think it reads better with two step shading rather than the 3. When it's
    viewed as lines of copy, the letters seem to have better definition, each letter
    more discernible from the other. Maybe try a version where outer outline is given
    a little more weight? Or even taking that intermediate shade and using it as a
    shadow behind the letter to increase legibility?
