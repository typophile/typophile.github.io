  body: "Monterey is one of Bitsteam's knockoffs and looking through its character
    set there are some glyphs that are not drawn well or as true as Mahogany Script
    from Monotype. Mahogany Script also come with an Alternates font that has a few
    different glyphs in it. And on top of that Monotype gives a away a free font too-
    Chilada Dos! And its $2.75 cheaper!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=203231&grab_id=0&page_id=6062&query=mahogany&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nSo
    hit that back button or cancel that transaction because the Monotype version is
    the one you want...\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nBy the way, I actually own
    this font, so you can trust my opinion.\r\n"

  body: "Mikey, we might disagree on that one. :^) Though it is common knowledge that
    Bitstream has a great number of renamed versions of fonts from Linotype, Monotype
    et al..., I can tell from first-hand experience that a lot of their digitisations
    are of a superior quality compared to the the \"originals\".\r\n\r\nIt's not like
    they actually <em>stole</em> the digital outlines (though here again for some
    specific cases there are different versions to the story), but they digitised
    their own versions. Compare for example [[Linotype]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.76.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=A&sampleSize=388\">Melior</a>
    to [[Bitstream]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.122155.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=A&sampleSize=388\">Zapf
    Elliptical 711</a>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a very interesting discussion on this
    topic featuring some insightful comments from Erik Spiekermann and David Berlow
    seems to have disappeared during the transition from the original Typophile to
    Version 2 a little over a year ago. Bummer..."

  body: "I wouldn't be so quick to call it a knock off of Mahogany Script. Both companies
    have done numerous \"knock-offs\" of other faces but in this case Bitstream appears
    to have acquired and digitised the original  face from Intertype, Monterey here.
    So it's the other way around, Mahogany could be a knock-off of Monterey. I had
    a quick glance and it appears that Mahogany isn't as delicate nor elegant as Monterey,
    the finer strokes have been thickened and some of the terminals end oddly. \r\n\r\nI
    don't really know. :^)"

  body: "Umm... Do you guys actually own any of these fonts? I do and the Bitstream-
    original or whatever- is not as good. The basic latin stuff is just about the
    same. Its the supporting symbols I have a problem with.\r\n\r\n@, copyright, greek
    micro sign, pilcrow, section, registered, trademark, yen, etc are all pulled out
    of the Times Roman parts bin. (Maybe not Times but you get my point)\r\n\r\nThe
    only thing I actually like in Monterey are the dagger and the double-dagger. These
    glyphs are tilted and look cuter.\r\n\r\nBut as for the Latin it all looks the
    same- and no- Mahogany Script is not thicker. (although on the Monotype site the
    braces look fat- they are in fact NOT fat and are well balanced in stroke.\r\n\r\nI
    guess instead of knockoff I should have said 'shoddy execution\". And yes- Zapf
    Elliptical is much better. And in a heartbeat I would buy Charter Pro or Iowa
    from Bitstream. Other fonts I don't know. I would make that purchase decision
    on the basis of who has done the best interpretation/implementation, price, license,
    perks etc. \r\n\r\nIn this case GET THE MONOTYPE VERISON!!!\r\nMonotype is cheaper,
    better implemented, comes with an Alternate font, plus a bonus free font and I
    did for get to mention its cheaper... and two free tickets to Tokyo... okay NOT!\r\n\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nMikey"

    you for certain what face <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=203231&grab_id=0&page_id=6062&query=Mahogany&SCOPE=Fonts#history\"
    target=\"new\">Mahogany Script</a> was originally based on, but I can tell you
    it was released in 1981 from the \"Custom Type\" group collection at Compugraphic.
    That means that a CG customer had requested the typeface to be produced based
    on another specimen for their specific use, most likely done for an EditWriter
    filmstrip font years before.\r\n\r\nMany of the early CG customers were \"Mom
    & Pop\" shop printers, so Mahogany Script was most likely based on one of the
    thousands of Wedding Scripts printers used for handset invitations. I am not trying
    to ID the original for you, just giving you a little background on how it got
    into the Monotype Imaging collection.\r\n\r\n"

    of course, I thought you meant alternate glyphs like swashes and ligatures and
    stuff.\r\n\r\nI completely agree with you about the supporting symbols, I now
    see what you mean. These are indeed a disgrace to be included in the character
    set of such fine digitisations. They look completely out of place and are often
    downright ugly.\r\n\r\nI guess Bitstream used that as a shortcut in order to get
    the typefaces on the market as fast as they could in the early digitisation rush,
    but they've had plenty of time to correct that mistake and still haven't."

    can tell that by the early Adobe fonts -- some of them are so crappy I wouldn't
    have touched them with a ten foot long composing stick (see for example [[Erik

    free font, Chilada Dos. eikes~ the font gives me the crippy crawlers.. strangely,
    it's twice the cost of Mahogany font. I think it's adios (trash bin) to chilada
    dos. :)))
