    workstation with OS 9 brought me more headaches and discomfort than a thousand
    days of hangovers. \r\n\r\nOnce OS X arrived (along with some bugs which were
    ironed out) and the switch to Intel processors happened... well that's the point
    where I start to get misty-eyed."

    with 10.1, and having a Mac user explain that it was crashing every twenty minutes
    because I needed to allocate memory to individual applications. Once I realized
    that the OS lacked memory protection I just went to OS X full-time and never looked
    back. There were certainly glory days for the old Mac OS, but I can\u2019t remember
    any occurring after ninth grade..."

    knew where every file went, how to fully trace an install--shoot, I even remember
    using ResEdit to make my own icons and play splash screen games with unsuspecting
    coworkers.\r\n\r\nNow, I just turn the thing on and hope it will work without
    hiccups.....For giggles, I do have a working Mac Classic with OS 7.1 installed
    and it still runs. 4 Megs of RAM and a 40 Meg HD, wow!\r\n"

    They've been advertising that an OS X version has been "coming soon" for years!
    From what I can tell it's not even breathing hard.

    You got system 2.4 and finder 4.3, and then they updated to system 3.1 and finder
    4.8. I seem to remember they never used the x.0 numbers."
