body: Hi everyone, I really like the font named SANSA from <a href="http://www.ourtype.com/">ourtype</a>  but
  I find it way too expensive &#40;500 euro for the whole family&#41; . Does anyone
  know of a similar but cheaper font ? thanks in advance.

  body: Ergo is a good example. The &#34;Frutiger Next italics&#34; and Lucas de Groot
    &#34;The Sans Italics&#34; have also some of the Linotype Ergo.

  body: if it&#39;s for a logotype, why not draw it yourself -- that&#39;s much cheaper.
    study some of the typefaces you think are moving in the right direction, eg Sansa,
    and then run off to you drawing table.

    family of 5 fonts and 18 weights - only $34 for a variant! <BR> <BR>I see on the
    website that you can get a smaller set for only 150 Euros &#40;$183 US&#41; -
    again, this includes 4 weights. <BR> <BR>Seems in line with other professional
    foundries &#40;Adobe, Font Font, Hoefler, etc.&#41; '
