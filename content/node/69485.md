  need Euro/foreign characters), and I'm overwhelmed trying to figure out which website
  to buy from and which package to license. \r\n\r\nLinotpe offers [[http://www.linotype.com/191887/pmncaeciliacompletefamily-valuepack.html#format|PMN
  Caecilia Complete Family Pack]] in \"Open Type Com\" for $310 and in \"Open Type
  Std\" for $195. They're both 8 fonts. Reading the Linotype Support area on OT did
  not enlighten me as to the difference. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/pmn_caecilia_std_complete_family_value_pack/|FontShop]]
  and many other websites also sell Caecilia packages. I've spent way too much time
  trying to figure this out and would much appreciate any advice! "

    it is: http://www.linotype.com/1697/opentypeinfo.html\r\n\r\nThe difference between
    the com pro and std is basically how many characters beyond Western Europe they
    have. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, the designer generally gets the biggest cut when you
    buy from him, or the first company that issued the font, I think in this case
    Linotype I believe. Now owned by Monotype :)"

    advice to consider the designer's cut when deciding where to purchase. You are
    wonderful and I'm so grateful for your help.
