  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hay,</p>
<p>I have two screens and one of them has washed out colors, but only in Photoshop (CS4, Vista). I&rsquo;ve googled about it and found that I have to use the screen&rsquo;s default color working space, but that&rsquo;s what I already had. I&rsquo;m stumped and it&rsquo;s annoying for things to look unrepresentative in one of the screens, since my workflow depends on having zoomed out versions on the side. Has anyone ever come across a problem like this and perhaps managed to resolve it? I&rsquo;m even considering a clean OS reinstall.</p>
<p>P.S. Looking at the neigbouring topics, I&rsquo;m starting to feel this was the wrong place to post. Sorry about that. I do use Photoshop for typography, though. :3</p>

Your best bet is to just have one good display, keep it calibrated, but never trust it and always run test prints on a good inkjet that can handle real CMYK printing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Getting two screens the same is indeed hard to do, so your best bet is to just use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->same<!-- raw HTML omitted --> profile on both screens (in the software). It may differ optically, but at least the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be the same. I would never use the screen&rsquo;s profile, because it isn&rsquo;t very universal, and you don&rsquo;t know what range the profile has. I&rsquo;d set Photoshop to Adobe RGB (1998), which has a good color range. And also keep the profiles the same in every Adobe application for consistency (you can use Bridge to change them all at once).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you have the whole CS? If yes, the best way is to set the colour profile in Bridge, as it synchronises across the whole suite. Then, depending where (US, Europe, Japan?) and how you work (print/screen?), select an appropriate profile , web offset/sheet-fed offset, etc.). That way the discrepancy can be solved (perhaps?) by tweaking the screens. 2¢</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m by no mean an expert, since in our shop I only do black &amp; white. My partner does all the color work. But we both use dual monitor setups, and I have listened to him grumble . . .</p>
<p>You absolutely, positively have to calibrate the monitors. Even for B&amp;W. With the old CRT&rsquo;s, this was relatively easy, as far as  painful things go. With the newer flat-screen monitors, the cheaper ones cannot be completely calibrated. Sadly, you need the costly monitors &ndash; back lit, is it?</p>
<p>I do use a dual monitor setup. What I do is to keep my tools, layers, history, actions etc. on one; the &ldquo;good&rdquo; monitor is for the image. In point of fact, I use a CRT for the &ldquo;tools&rdquo; monitor and a good, albeit not the best, LCD monitor for the image. If you gotta zoom in, bite the bullet &amp; take the time to do it on the good monitor. Otherwise, spend the 10+K for two very good monitors, or suffer as you&rsquo;re currently doing.</p>
<p>The only other tip I could offer is to pick the colorspace you want work in to fit your needs. Use it, get use to it. Periodically make a profile for your proofing printer &ndash; laser printers seem to have to be profiled every damn day, inkjet seem to hold longer. Before printing the image, convert. If, like us, you send work off to a printer (the book &ldquo;printer&rdquo; not the &ldquo;proofing printer&rdquo; in your shop), again, see if they have a profile for you to convert to, do that, then set the color space to &ldquo;same as source&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;none&rdquo;) in the PDF file.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, your work is going to a compositor &ndash; for example, if you&rsquo;re a cartographer &ndash; do tag the images with the profile you&rsquo;ve used. I guarantee you we don&rsquo;t work in the same colorspace you do. We&rsquo;re all better off if we just convert rather than first having to guess the proper profile to assign before converting.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>
<p>P.S. If, like me, you use a lot of layers, even having the image at 51% size won&rsquo;t really show what you&rsquo;ve got. Flatten the image, take a look, and back up one step in the history to keep working. Also, I never flatten my working image before printing proofs. I make a copy, flatten that, &amp; change it to 8-bit. That way, you can make a correction to your working image with less risk of posturizing. We do work in the 16 bit mode, changing to 8 only for final . . .did I mention that our files are pretty large?</p>
