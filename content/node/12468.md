  sort of evening everything out. Right now I am unhappy with the ee's. Any suggestions
  you have on improving this would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: The naivete of the written word, the imperfection, will be what makes it most
    interesting and/or memorable. The typeface you have chosen for the "fine jewelry
    and watches" is what you should be worried about. If you scale this down by half
    you realize that it is lost. I'd focus on the name. Add more contrast. The loop
    of the l in Caroleena has a ribbon-like quality that would be nice if it surfaced
    in other places.
