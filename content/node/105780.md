  body: "Image has only top part of phrase.\r\nIs it \"Forest View\"? If it is we
    could compare the two appearances of the letter e to see if they are identical.
    If they are different I would have little doubt that this is lettering and not
    a font. Even if they are identical I have doubts. I did not find a match with
    anything that I could find that was available in 1963 including lettering from
    Letraset. But possibly another letting company had it.\r\nDon"

    body: "I have spent about 4 hours looking and was wondering the same thing if
      it was hand lettered. They did a good job. If you know of something similar,
      please let me know.  Thanks for the reply. Sherry Williams.\r\n(This is what
      was sent to me; not the whole picture.) Thought it would be enough to get a
      feel."
