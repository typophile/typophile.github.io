body: "Last year some friends opened a shop called Gubb & Mackie on Customs Street
  in downtown Auckland; when I visited the shop they had just refurbished the place
  and unearthed this mid-20th century mosaic from under the floor vinyl, welcome mat
  and god-knows-what-else.\r\n\r\nInteresting to see how much extra trouble the lettering
  artist of the day had gone to over that angular ampersand; I figure that by the
  time they'd trimmed all the tiles to allow for the diagonal insets, it couldn't
  have been much of a time-saver.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_mosaic_4173.jpg]"

    not sure what you mean by \"extra trouble\" over that ampersand, unless you imagine
    the alternative, a round design at a 6 tile cap height as being extra large trouble.
