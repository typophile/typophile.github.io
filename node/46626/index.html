		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You shouldn’t stay in the same position for too long.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The way the industry is structured and positions set up, it isn&rsquo;t possible to stay in any one position for too long. I work on a contractual basis for an agent who finds me work. I don&rsquo;t hold an actual position or job as such. I&rsquo;m given jobs to do for numerous clients. My agent sends me in, I go in, do the job, get out real quickly. I ams da semantic hitman. Much of it I do from my desk at home. The hardest part is getting paid.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it’s good, it transcends language.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes and no. Some ads I&rsquo;ve worked on are &ldquo;good&rdquo; by industry standards, but they don&rsquo;t transcend language. Others kick arse in a purely visual capacity with no use of verbal or written language at all, but they still involve semantics, and in that sense are transcendent.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Working in the industry will affect your family life at some point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes, but so what, working in any industry will affect your family life.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It creates careers for art-school dropouts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes, most definitely. I never bothered finishing art school because it was packed with wankshafts, most of who I now compete with on a professional basis.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The same concepts are endlessly recycled.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Oh spit yeah. But it&rsquo;s a high-pressure industry. It eats people and devours ideas.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You fast-forward through the boring stuff.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Who, ad people or consumers?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Internet took it to a whole new level.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes it did. Some people ask me why I don&rsquo;t have an online portfolio when I&rsquo;m an ad writer/concept guy and the internet surely is cutting edge for self-promotion in that line. The answer is — I don&rsquo;t need one, my agent gets me all the work I can handle. The same people ask me why my agent doesn&rsquo;t have a website. The answer is — they don&rsquo;t need one either. They use the traditional tools of the trade; a paper notepad, an eraser pencil and a phone. Job sourcing and media buyers use the internet only sparingly to promote themselves. The business really doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Everything that happens is a foregone conclusion predicated on existing relationships between people who are &ldquo;in the business&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s hard to transition out of.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes, very hard. I&rsquo;m a failed filmmaker so I took the next best thing. Now I want out but it&rsquo;s hard, very hard to get &ldquo;out&rdquo;, so wish me success with my type designs because I&rsquo;m a lot like an actor — I don&rsquo;t know how to do anything else, and I&rsquo;m gettin' old.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They both have weird self-congratulatory award shows.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yepp. The internet awards shows are much wierder and self-congratulatory than anything I&rsquo;ve seen in advertising.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only the people who create it are delusional enough to call it art.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call it art, and most people I work with don&rsquo;t pretend it&rsquo;s art either. It&rsquo;s soft soap (industry term). I&rsquo;ve met people who create it and call it art, and those are the people I avoid working with.</p>
