  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I really hope I&rsquo;m putting this in the right place. Feel free to chew me out and move it if it&rsquo;s not, sorry!</p>
<p>I was at a high school journalism conference at the University of Texas last weekend, and in the class I was in, we were given the opportunity to design a random page. So, the page I designed is one that I&rsquo;ve had rolling around my head for quite some time; basically it was a feature page on student artists. For this, I decided to find a nice, messy, handwriting font for the headlines. Now, we were on UT&rsquo;s macs in their journalism room, so I didn&rsquo;t have access to the fonts I usually would have sprung for, but I settled on a nice font called Handwriting Dakota. When I got home, I started googling around to find more out about this font and I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. I don&rsquo;t know where it came from, or where I could get it to use again if I wanted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to post a sample of it, I&rsquo;m curious to see what you guys think of it. It&rsquo;s, so far, my favorite messy, handwriting font I&rsquo;ve been able to find. Are there other ones you guys like more?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a random sample (it&rsquo;s even hard to find samples of it!): <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YISIpG_ed7o/SFqWFrIXO3I/AAAAAAAAAP4/LxrTQaHc0AY/s400/mind-dont-matter.gif">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YISIpG_ed7o/SFqWFrIXO3I/AAAAAAAAAP4/LxrTQaHc0AY/s400/mind-dont-matter.gif</a></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m at it, I&rsquo;m super new, could someone tell my how to embed a photo, instead of just posting a link?</p>
<p>Thanks guys :]</p>

But you can move it yourself to a better section:
<img src="/images/old-images/how-to_3961.png" alt="">
And the you can also embed one or more image(s) (590px max width).</p>
<p>As for the font, it comes with Mac OS X/iMovie ’09. It was created by Vletter.com in 1995 and taken over by Apple in 2001. Browsing through old treads, it turns out (thanks Mike Y. :-) it’s available as Fultons Hand: <a href="http://www.kandjsupplies.com/text_fonts_handwriting/fultons_hand.html">http://www.kandjsupplies.com/text_fonts_handwriting/fultons_hand.html</a></p>

<p>It has lots of open type features and alternate characters which makes it feel more like it was actually handwritten.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That Dakota font is from the old ClickArt collection called Handwritten Fonts. I&rsquo;m familiar with this collection because my hand printing sample became &ldquo;Bowfin&rdquo; in that collection. There was a company called Signature Font, I think,  that turned your printed sample into a font for around $50 back in the mid-1990&rsquo;s and they sent some of us letters requesting permission to use our fonts in a collection they were compiling for Click Art. As our payment, we got a free copy of the font CD when it was released.</p>
<p>As  far as I know, besides Dakota being used by Apple, the collection is still available embedded with other ClickArt collections that are sold by Broderbund.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;alias names&rsquo; were from a WSi collection that had copied and renamed the ClickArt fonts. They distributed their renamed copies to other vendors to sell, until eventually I think they were told to cease and desist using fonts that were not their own. I&rsquo;d like to think I was one of the people who blew the whistle on them, because Precision Type was starting to offer the renamed collection by WSi and I wrote to Precision Type and explained the history. They were immediately withdrawn from sale.</p>
