  body: "I love it!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you were specifically inspired by Victor
    Jara, although both faces have a great Latino feel to them. I particularly love
    the all caps redonda.\r\n\r\nI am noticing in the lower case redonda that some
    of the letters with long, straight lines (like d, h, j) feel darker than the short,
    round letters (o, m, n). I'm not sure there's much you can do about that\u2014I
    think it just happens because they have a longer line of uninterrupted pixels.
    It doesn't bother me too much. Overall, they are both beautiful and legible.\r\n\r\nWill
    it be available to buy?\r\n\r\nAnalisa"

  body: "Hello Analisa, thanks for the comment.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration doesn't come
    directly from Victor Jara's work. It's only the name.\r\n\r\nAbout the long lines
    they are a little bit darker, but not enough to change the structure.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, will be available on september in latinotype foundry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njko "
