  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay folks! Here are three of my favorites that you can't have. These are unreleased- and most likely, will never be released- fonts that rock my little typographic socks.

Volvo Sans... used on all Volvo controls and switches. Its like Handel Gothic only more swedish-er.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/001_4215.jpg]

Bloomindales... This swanky typeface has been strutting its stuff while the folks who made Chalet were not even born yet. [And no, Horatio doesn't cut the mustard]

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/header_bags_5019.jpg]

Lumene Script from Suomi... This is my favorite handwriting font ever! Perhaps when Lumene Cosmetics will change campaigns will then we have access to this genius face. Think of it as Emma Script with less caffeine. Plz Script is a significantly less refined alternative however the up-and-coming Suomi Script would be fascinating.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lumene_6099.jpg]

But good news in 2011 we get access to Dereon... a luscious scotch face and in 2008 Parisine Office from Porchez. :-)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dereon_exemple_4263.gif]

Do you have exclusive fonts that you wish you could have... post images, names, and foundries.

I went to a lecture by the husband and wife team, Massimo and Lella Vignelli, who did the Bloomingdales identity (in 1972) among their wide range of projects over the last 40+ years; Massimo Vignelli described the Bloomingdales logo as a simply customised Avant Garde. (In general they tend to use unadorned, tried and trusted classic and modern typefaces for identity and logo treatments - see also American Airlines, NYC subway signage, Knoll logo etc but occcasionally customise - they did their own Bodoni for example)</div>

Hrant, I do understand that typographers don't necessarily have a high opinion of M Vignelli - especially given his comments about there being too many fonts in the world, none he regards as useful produced in the last 30 years, etc. I can see how he could be acccused of not understanding, ignoring or even dismissing typography. Seems pretty good at communicating though.</div>

That post deals with Volvo Broad and some others. The font I love is the one actually used inside the cars. Its very different and still very much avant-garde.

I've wanted to do Nagy's work for some time. Antikva Margeret has always been one of my favorites for a long time. I've never run across good samples of all of his work though. All I have is an old VGC specimen from the 70s. Anybody know of any really good sources? And is there any possible contact info for relatives, heirs, etc?

Take a look at Antikva Margaret and you'll see what he means. It's geometric-organic the same way C. R. Mackintosh's work is. Looks a little boxy, but all curves.

Okay, now I'm jealous. Do you have more than the regular roman? VGC catalog shows an italic as well as light, extrabold, and black weights.

New York was another nice one. I used to keep big photostats of both to look at, but never had a job I could use them for. There was a day school I used to pass whose sign was painted in New York. Always nice to see it, though not really the right face for the job.

Surprisingly I couldn't find a specimen with New York in it, and the Jaspert & Berry <em>Encyclodpedia of Typefaces</em> doesn't list it or Antikva Margaret.

Hey, nice. Got any pictures?

I finally located a phototype specimen of it in an old Total Type (defunct Chicago type house) specimen that called it New York. VGC catalog calls it York, so perhaps York was the original name and New York the knockoff name.

Gee, I thought everyone has at least one! ;-)
Which leads me to a few faces that I doubt will ever see the light of digital-day --

Though Stempel AG acquires full ownership of the type foundry Klingspor Bros., VGC had these available in Typositor fonts:
> Folkwang (H. Schardt) 1949 (which CG digitized as an experimental font manipulation exercise).
> Orplid (H. Bohn) 1929, a sans display with 3D shadow.

Also will never be digitized:
Gerstner Program type family, nice but who needs another extended grotesk :\

http://www.teldesign.nl/opdracht/onderwijs/cito.html

You can find Cito Sans here. Super clean, very minimalist.

But my favorite, in fact one of the most successful designs, is CakeType's work for KPN. This should be released! If Myriad and Vista had a baby this is it. In fact I would say this thousnd times better than Vista! More elegant more powerful! But too exclusive :-(

Norbert Florendo> Unfortunately, I was at a very young age when the last VGC catalog was produced and I only started to love type when I was about 11 or 12 when I got my first Font & Function catalog. Folkwang is interesting. I have never heard of the Gerstner Program font... more info on that one please. Now Topic Rocks!!! 

gthompson> I wish I could post images of that bus stop... My Minolta Dimage XT is not working either... I spilled something on it in a night club and my $69 scanner is not mac friendly. I'm just sucking right now!!!

It came to my mind Inga, designed by Lennart Hansson and published by Mecanorma France (I think it existed just as a transferable type). I have it in a book Lennart sent me years ago. It's really a typeface I could use.
And then Andromeda by Aldo Novarese (existing probably in phototypesetting format only). It could be considered a sort of display companion to his own Mixage.
See if you can find samples of those two online…

Redrawn from scratch with some modifications to suit my purposes.
Shown: 1st Draft.

I was unable to arrange to buy font/licence at this time from Elsner&Flake (due to naming copyright issues in Europe) so redrew for use on a logotype project in progress.

I won't go into the modifications unless anyone is interested but I can tell you being a lover of Swiss sans serif the exercise has been an eye opener into the creation of the forms and optical considerations.

		<div class="commentbody">It is NiceTry who wants the bells and Whistles. I was wondering what was meant by this as-well! Perhaps double s, alternative ampersands, Sans-serif fist?

Unica Deux (because is closest to an archetypal form) is a development platform for me - so I'm using it to learn and try out ideas. My next task is to try out versions of the Cap R. This still bugs me. Even though the original is undoubtedly the correct way - there's no harm in trying alternatives and see if any do the trick.

I also like Mercator - I have just ordered a type specimen to have a better look at it, as I have only ever seen it as its own title in a Berthold type specimen book form the 80's with no setting or character set. (ill drop a scan when I get it). 

Mercator really gives off 60's vibe and is really direct. Great for massive one word Poster headings. The cap M is really broad. Nice.

My wish for what I want but cant have starts with Adonis by Stephenson Blake. It is a grotesk type which was made by filing off the serifs of a copperplate style font. The result is intriguing. Looking a bit like akzidenz buch extended but with something else??? I first saw an example when I was studying at Manchester, where there was a beautiful Purple and Blue specimen sheet. I should have xeroxed it! I have since found another sample, which I will put here in the future.</div>

If you are still curious to see how Inga looks, I could do a scan.
I think Lennart has a digital version (I have not asked him), however, although it seems it is no
t available from the Mecanorma catalogs of digital type from distributors.
This happens with many faces…

About Novarese: you can't imagine how much of his typefaces do not exist in digital forms.

I should add to the two entries above, Richler by Nick Shinn (a custom typeface).
From what I recall, I really could use it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Nina, I came back and looked at this the other day and saw I had kind of put a shopping list of "desires" together with @NiceTry's inspiration. As I have had a couple of goes at small caps now - this would make sense. I might try to do this without looking at the Unica Capitals and see where they end up. (Overlay was used for the lowercase). Actually I believe it is good practice to work on the more challenging small caps first (perhaps caps and small caps play off each other). I can't put a time scale on this yet as I have pressing matters to attend to like finish the MA thesis: 'Compact Typography: The design of typefaces conceived for small size applications.' 

Luckily Unica is timeless so waiting another bit longer won't hurt...

Anyway. A while back I saw this in real life which I think someone mentioned in another thread:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Art_and_Language_5653.jpg]

 [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Language/dp/3905701561/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=I330T5GHLYJRD5&colid=91K82JP8CXSN|A&L Art and Language]]

Close up it is not as true as I had hoped and there is a bold use of a dot on the i which kind of bugged me but is the style if the designers (whom I forget but I think are Swiss). Respect though - because the concept is perfect: offering typographic neutrality when discussing art (without perceived bias)!

Seriously, thanks for the update. The EPS idea sounds reasonable.
