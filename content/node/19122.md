body: "Dear typophiles,\r\ni asked for your help months ago about fonts for a satirical
  journal about Africa and Maghreb. A lot of things happened but let's say it's kind
  of the same project, the Middle-East added in the focused areas. The word bakchich
  is the french for baksheesh (the funny thing is we decided to name it  when i was
  searching fonts, and felt on the T26 baksheesh which doesn't really fit the journal
  but had that fine name)\r\nOther than giving a causual and friendly look, the idea
  of this big ligature was somewhat to give an arabian look, without going on a fake
  arabic. Using only western script letters but bounding them in a way which could
  relate to oriental scriptures. \r\nIt's supposed to be finished, and already used
  on some things, but i guess it may need some little changes, so your critics are
  more than welcomed.\r\nThe stick aside the b on the horribly stroked 2nd pic will
  be replaced by the website address of the journal.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-bakchich3.gif]"

  body: "A couple of things I would look at are the inside bottom of the counter of
    the c, the angle of the leg of the k, and make the ba ligature a bit broader.
    I would also look at how the tops of the letters and the dot on the i look if
    they are parallel with the baseline. On the outlined version I would look at some
    of the nicks and bumps, especially at the bottom and the i.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks a lot. I am going to look at the things you have noticed, and try
    to correct  them. I have already tried some things you mentionned, and made some
    choices. I prefer the tops of the letter as it is here than parallel with the
    baseline, a possibility i have tested \u2014 i find it too rigid. The inside of
    the C has been a big problem, i have tested several possibilities, and i'm not
    happy with the current state, but i don't really know how to improve it\u2026
    by making it rounder ? About the \"k\" leg, i had made it parrallel with the other
    vertical lines but it didn't work well, so maybe the problem is the angle is not
    different enough from the vertical lines one ?\r\nThanks a lot again, i'm working
    on it."

  body: "From about 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock the inside of the c should be thinner that
    is the direction I would look. for the k I would look at rotating it more anti-clockwise
    to make the angle. And while I am commenting the h's should be a little wider
    to make the join of the strokes less cramped.\r\nTim"

  body: "Sweet. If I had to be critical I would say that the \"k\" is a bit too cap
    \"R\"ish looking. I think it also breaks up the flow a bit as it has a horizontal
    aspect to it in the center, that the rest does not. Idid a screenshot an explored
    the issue for a couple of minutes, this is a direction I would suggest trying,
    although I am not sure it would solve the issue of it looking \"R\" ish. It does
    however deal with the horizontal issue. \r\nWithout being overly critical , I
    would say it looks great, as the context is completely understood, the issues
    mentioned are really minor. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/back.jpg]"

  body: "The dot over the i looks a tad small. I'd like to see it be taller (top to
    bottom) and slightly wider. Not with the same proportions you have here, but proportionally
    a bit taller than it is. Right now it looks visually a little too narrow.\r\n\r\nOn
    the k, have you tried slanting the lower part of the stroke enclosing the counter?
    I'd be interested to see what that looks like, especially combined with alchion's
    suggestion."
