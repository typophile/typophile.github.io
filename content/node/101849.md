body: Hello. I'm working on my first serious text face and currently the x-height
  is set to 410 units which happened automatically upon drawing the first character.
  I'm a newbie and know very little about the technical aspects of typeface design.
  Apart from readability, what are the other aspects which will influence when deciding
  the x-height; how does a designer determine the appropriate x-height.  Thank you.

    it look good as it is now?\r\nIf yes.. leave it as is.\r\nIf no... change it."

  body: "Hi Sevag! You can tell a question is good when it's hard to answer...  :-)\r\n\r\nI
    don't think \"if it looks good, it's good\" always works. If it did, text fonts
    would have descenders longer than ascenders (because some of the former need more
    room to look nice) but the opposite is true... Things beyond looks matter when
    you're making a text font. Some things to keep in mind:\r\n- More important than
    the relationship of the x-height to the Em is the relationships between the x-height,
    ascender height, descender depth, cap height and numeral height(s). The x-height
    is the main player (at least in the Latin alphabet, but for example not in the
    Georgian) but it can't ignore the rest.\r\n- In a text font an x-height is usually
    around 60-65% of the ascender height, but it can go over or under that for specific
    uses: under, for let's say a large book set in a relatively large point size;
    over (by a good deal) if it's for a newspaper. The reason for this is that the
    requirements for reading shift a bit, depending mostly on size, but also other
    factors: in \"choppy\" reading like in a newspaper seeing individual letters clearly
    is more important, whereas when reading an immersive book in comfort the ascenders
    and descenders matter more (because they help define boumas).\r\n- Cap height
    is typically a little under ascender height, and descender depth is less than
    ascender height (sometimes by a good amount - check out Berling). Numerals can
    have a variety of schemes...\r\n- The big one... The vertical proportions are
    tied in to two other major parameters: the color (darkness) of the font, and the
    overall spacing. This is because each one of those three things points to a certain
    ideal point size range, and they have to be pointing at the same range. Smaller
    sizes require darker color, a bigger x-height and looser spacing; larger sizes,
    the opposite. It's hard to get a feel for what's a good balance, but it helps
    a lot to look at existing fonts by masters like Carter. Remember though that there's
    no precise formula, and personal taste can shift things quite a bit, especially
    when it comes to color.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Another factor that Hrant doesn\u2019t mention is the ability to pack lines
    tighter. This is relevant in newspaper/magazine design because a multi-column
    text will have shorter lines and thus need less space between the lines* than,
    say, a book. Also, counter to what Hrant says, in large sizes (well above text
    size) the same requirement comes into play in, for example, a headline. This ties
    in with headline faces commonly being spaced tighter horizontally than text faces:
    they are also \u201Cspaced\u201D tighter vertically, using the x-height and descender
    depth as the main variables.\r\n\r\n* I\u2019d love for someone else to explain
    this in depth, but in general: \r\n1: At a certain distance (and this distance
    is closely intertwined with the length of the lines and whitespace around the
    text) lines begin to form a visual \u201Cmass\u201D instead of just separate lines.
    \r\n2: In a book, with longer measure, it\u2019s hard to find the next line if
    the lines don\u2019t have enough space between them.\r\n"

  body: "Good points - there's certainly a lot more in here... For example that the
    overall width of a font also plays into what vertical proportions work well; and
    how the frequency of linebreaks (which is very high in newspapers) affects what
    role width ends up playing in economy...\r\n\r\nAlso, even in a book \"packing
    lines tighter\" matters, because it's not just a matter of collision. For example
    when the descenders (which are linguistically infrequent) are too long you're
    wasting vertical space that could be used to amplify readability in other regions
    (mostly the x-height, but secondarily the ascenders). I use the term \"apparent
    leading\", which is what I think determines ease of \"line return\" when reading.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing you wrote that I'm not getting is that #1. Is that an aesthetic issue?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
