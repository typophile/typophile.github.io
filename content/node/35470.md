  body: "\r\nTruth is, i/work doesnt own it (hence the scan) . I wandered if there
    was something that i do have on my computer at work that would come in close.
    I have never used the font or anything similar  before, so have never really searched
    for one similar.\r\n\r\nHope i've been a bit clearer? \r\n\r\nthanks. \r\n\r\n

  body: There aren't any bundled fonts that are very similar. You might have to spring
    for a font license this time.
