    is to use the name \"American Type Founders\" as the author. I hope this helps.
    Also Librarians often have good ideas about how best to search their collections.
    Sometimes you have to ask more than one though. ;-) \r\n\r\nPlease do let us know
    what works for you if it does.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Using author names does bring up some of the books, but not everything. The
    LOC catalog is pretty wonky, and I find that with type stuff the best results
    often come from just popping the title in as a keyword.
