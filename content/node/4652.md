body: I am pretty much done with this logo, and I didn&#39;t have a lot of leeway
  with it &#40;couldn&#39;t really modify the bear since this is originally a Chinese
  org&#41;.  But I am wondering if you all think I need to have a period after the
  A in USA?  It looks wonky if I put one there.  My other idea was to use circles
  in place of periods, then I think that makes this less &#39;agrammatical&#39; <BR>
  <BR>thoughts? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35366.gif"

  body: Hello Petro <BR> <BR>Mr Brighurst &#40;in his &#34;The Elements of Typographic
    Style&#34;&#41; implies a use of very common acronyms as dotless with loose kerning
    and small caps. In your case of cource you don&#39;t need sc, but half space between
    the letters would do your job and look better &#40;i think&#41;. <BR> <BR>christos
    <BR> <BR>p.s. if you are going to use dots it is for sure wrong not to use all
    of them.  <BR>It will be like United States of A.

  body: Personal, I&#39;d lose the periods alltogether. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re
    necessary at all. Nice work on the logo!
