  body: "According my experience I did learn some tricks about blackletter legibility,
    because this kind of style tend to merge its strokes with other gliphs or loose
    their parts making a hard work to reach read it and sometimes we need to keep
    the look closer to original pattern to solve such troubles, e.g. The word \"Big\"
    the base of /i/ need to be oblique falling to forward (as classic) or it will
    looks like an /L/ this will be highlighted if dot above keep appoint to stem or
    as shorter stroke (closer to a simple dot).\r\n\r\nIn word \"Smoke\" (it's fun
    but I have had hard to reach to read this) at first look I saw a letter /p/ instead
    /m/ and a /R/ instead /K/ well you might try to draw the first stroke of /m/ shorter
    and again the base last stroke keep oblique falling-forward as /i/ for /K/ and
    according the original tradition of this gliphs construction the ascendant used
    to be appoint forward too covering the rest below itself as roof so you can make
    diferent from /R/.\r\n\r\nTry to make this simplest, control the curviness at
    base of stems, many times this kind of decorations looks well but we need to be
    sure about this kind of extra shapes don't will change the main structure of our
    finished letters, the best way to know wich one its better choice is draw and
    redraw as many as you can and test the readability asking another person (prefer
    somebody that don't know what's the logo said before his or her read it).\r\n\r\nHope
    this little advice be helpful to you.\r\nCheers"
