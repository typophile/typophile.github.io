  body: Thank you! What I originally had in mind is a font that is slightly narrower
    than Binny or Old Style No. 7 - I'm beginning to realize that there were probably
    a whole style of fonts similar to the one in my example picture. If anyone knows
    other similar fonts from this period I would like to hear from you.

  body: You might try <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/century+old+style/fonts/">Century
    Old Style</a>, which was a sort of distillation of the genre. It may be a bit
    too condensed in comparison, though.
