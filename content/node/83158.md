body: "Is there any substantial reason against dropping the right-side serifs in the
  capital Thorn in bolder weights, rather than making the bowl really flat? How do
  Icelanders/Faroese feel about this? (Sorry if this has come up before, couldn't
  find anything.)\r\n\r\nHere's what I mean:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thorn_5818.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  will obviously only be a problem where serifs are thick, contrast low to non existent
  (or reversed I guess), and target sizes below \xABhuge\xBB.\r\n\r\nIn the way of
  examples, I've found that <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-TqH6Mw\">Dispatch</a> and
  <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-qzOoMW\">ITC Officina Serif</a> use the serif-dropping
  approach, whereas for instance <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-Lhs89u\">Rockwell</a>
  opts for thinning the serifs more than normal. I personally think that's rather
  ugly (and wouldn't work for all faces), but how attached are Thorn-users to their
  complete serifage?\r\n\r\nAlso: I assume all capitals (uppercase, smallcaps, &c.)
  in a given font/style should be treated the same? (The third weight above would
  work with the serifs in the cap, but not the smallcap, so I've removed them in the
  cap too.)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n<em>[Edited vicious typo. Sorry]</em>"

    not possible to make a reasonable Thorn without stripping off the serifs (as  much
    as I hate to). And often there is no space to make a bowl without making the whole
    character look like some kind of a big ink blob but that is what one would always
    try to first. \r\n\r\nThe bowl does not have to be the size of the P bowl and
    often I rather watch the bowl of the R.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, please visit us at the

    \xABnew\xBB (i.e. not-tried-and-tested-before) ideas with this \u2013 for one
    thing, I don't have the time right now that I'd want/need for testing and asking
    people for feedback etc. Is there prior evidence of something like letting the
    Thorn descend working? \r\n\r\nTo recap, the problem is that if I leave the serifs
    in, especially in the Bold Smallcaps (not to speak of Petite Caps) the bowl becomes
    quite deflated, which looks like it can't be right (and definitely doesn't look
    too recognizable). And since this is for smallish sizes, the serifs start nastily
    clogging against the top/bottom of the bowl long before. \r\n\r\n> The bowl does
    not have to be the size of the P bowl and often I rather watch the bowl of the

    become less horizontal and more diagonal ( like the join on the n) as the font
    becomes bolder which would allow you to have a bigger counter. Or you could angle
    only the outer portion of the bowl. \r\n\r\nIf you choose an approach like these
    looking at the joins in your very dense glyphs like th & 8 and anywhere else you
    may have made an optical adjustment would give you a kind of baseline to compare
    against."

    Still, the best thing is probably to find a group of users of the glyph and to
    show them some options ins seal setting and see which ones work best for them.
    \r\n\r\nI suspect that the value of the serifs in making a rapid and correct ID
    of the letter is limited and that the clarity of the bowl and it's placement at
    the midpoint is the main thing. I can imagine loosing the serifs starting a a
    certain size to preserve what might be most essential. \r\n\r\nNice question and
