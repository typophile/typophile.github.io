  body: the Rodney Sheldon Fehsenfeld font you used seems a bit dated. <BR>To assist
    you in finding the right typeface, it would be helpful to know more about the
    client / restaurant. Upscale or inexpensive daily grub. Location - mall, college
    town or suburbs, the type of people you would expect to visit this place- business
    folks of high school students. Alchohol establishment or not. In other words serious
    demographics. I am no legal expert but the name sure sounds a lot like the famous
    Chili&#39;s franchise. To take precaution perhaps it would be worth suggesting
    to your client to double check with lawyer who knows copyright laws regarding
    the name. <BR>

  body: C, where are you going to school, if its in a city, I&#39;d suggest walking
    around and looking at the signage, if thats not possible, surf the web and look
    at the logos of some of the chains like McDonalds and Chili&#39;s. Start your
    logo design with pencil to paper, come up with the shapes that you like, then
    find the type to suit. Make sure you tell the potential client its a restaurant
    and the type of atmosphere and food thats served.

  body: '&#34;this logo just 4 our school assignments&#34; is a bullshit excuse. <BR>
    <BR>School work can be your best work. Take this seriously. <BR> <BR>In real life
    you will have clients that have no consistant <BR>views regarding branding and
    identity, It will be your task to educate them and explain why some things will
    work and others <BR>will not. You will have to consider everything, and bill them
    for your expertise. <BR> <BR>Example- I am billing a client $2600 tomorrow to
    do pre-liminary scope of their branding needs. No actual design work just consulting
    and planning. With better planning better work will be done in the end that is
    target orinented and a real business tool with actual worth &#40;intellectual
    property&#41;, not just something to physically differentiate a restaurant from
    it&#39;s neighbor the corner grocery store.  <BR> <BR>Take this chance to created
    an original, logical, and aesthetic <BR>identity for a client &#40;even if it
    imaginary or a professor&#41;  <BR> <BR>In the real world you will have to fight
    for your ideas, or become  <BR>someone who just does as clients suggest and make
    a few bucks but never feels proud of the work. Later you may find clients that
    want you to think harder and develop better concepts but  <BR>because your portfolio
    does not reflect great concepts and deployment of concepts no one will listen.
    You are smart to ask good question at this stage in you education, and to spend
    the time to deliver a viable solution. This work can get you hired. <BR> <BR>This
    process will obviously take more time, so have another cup of coffee and stay
    up all night to deliver something exceptional.'

  body: C, try this, look at a real ice cube and draw it in dimension or photograph
    it. Make the type look like it is etched into the ice cube. and maybe let the
    cube melt a bit so it looks cool and refreshing. Add a tagline something about
    cool and refreshing food and drinks. There is a chain called Chillys here that
    features hot and spicy food you need to make sure you get what your resturant
    does across to the consumer clearly. Remember the meaning of Assume. Assume means
    make an &#149;&#149;&#149; of U and Me. So don&#39;t assume the customer knows
    anything.
