      \ aparantly I was wrong about the \"Golf Guide\" part.  I thought it was \"Georgia\"
      but I can't quite match up the new text with the old.\r\n    Let me just say
      that I'm a photoshop novice so you know my skill level. I've tried changing
      the \"vertical and horizontal\" scales but the \"Georgia\" still seems to be
      different. (more narrow).\r\n    Any help on the \"Golf Guide\" font would be
      appreciate.\r\nThanks,\r\nTom"
