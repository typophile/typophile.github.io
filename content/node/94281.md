  spacing before and after the slash/solidus/slant character in professional typesetting.\r\n\r\nI
  need advice on spacing in English, French, and Spanish languages. Opinions are fine,
  and I have one myself. I am hoping for some professional, scholarly information
  that goes beyond personal opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "And don't ignore the virgule, which has a different slope.  Bringhurst states
    that the solidus should be kerned,which implies no spaces before or after. However,
    his printed examples have quite a bit of white space around them, indicating very
    loose kerning.\r\n\r\nIt depends on the context whether a line break can occur
    following a slash. FOr instance, it's never OK to split the two parts of a fraction,
    but if it's two words that are separated by the slant character (there: I've used
    all the terms for it) then a line can end with the solidus. Personally, I wouldn't
    end a page with it, though. Too confusing.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'In English, I go by the context: by default, I space / around the slash,
    but sometimes it helps solve ambiguity not to have spaces. So whichever is clearer
    in context. In the same way that a hyphen becomes an en dash when one of the compound
    parts it''s connecting is more than one word, I think a slash gets spaces around
    it when one (or more) of the things it''s diving is more than one word. I usually
    prefer spaces, though, unless there''s a good reason not to. I think Bringhurst
    has examples of both styles, which seems to imply it depends on context.'
