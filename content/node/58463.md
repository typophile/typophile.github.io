  body: "It may come from a Garamond, but I don't think it's ITC Garamond. The relative
    height of the l and k isn't right, and even the k leg position is different, assuming
    you accept that the end of the k leg was modified. It seems that too much would
    have had to change, although I know anything is possible.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yes Mike, I agree that its not ITC garamond.  The serifs are too rounded compared
    to this.. and yes I also think there could be some modification on the f and k,
    still most could/should still be derived from an original font I believe. More
    opinions more than welcome :)

  body: "I have been searching Garalde typefaces looking for similar k structure (ignoring
    the flip leg), and it seems that Zapf and Goudy have used similar leg placement
    in some of their typefaces. The lower leg of the k connects close to the stem,
    but on the upper leg. Zapf's Aldus and Zapf Renaissance look pretty close to the
    k used in the logo.\r\n\r\nThe initial f looks very customized, and it surprises
    me that a hair salon would have a custom logo, unless this is a large chain of
    shops.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I guess my conclusion is that this is certainly a custom logo. If I had to
    pick a starting point, I would use [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/zapf-renaissance-antiqua-sh/|Zapf
    Renaissance Antiqua]], and I would shorten the l so that the serifs on top of
    the l and k are stepped, such that the top edges of the serifs form a straight
    line. Then I would clip off the leg of the italic k and transplant it on the Roman
    k (and then probably tweak it a lot). The f would be a challenge for me, because
    I have no skill at this (obviously), but I know this would be relatively simple
    work for any one of the font designers who hang out here.\r\n\r\nYour original
    question was whether this was a font or custom, and I vote the latter.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "It certainly did, because it had a professional look to it. Thinking that
    this must have been a franchise hair salon operation I looked for, but could not
    find, this hair salon on the web, so if this is a one-off shop I am really surprised
    they would have gone to the trouble (and presumed expense) of having a custom
    logo designed. Two things occurred to me: 1) It is cheaper than I think to have
    a logo made; or, 2) This lettering comes from a font I haven't found yet. \r\n\r\nThe
    f has some attributes of an italic f, but it is vertical. I think if I see that
    f anywhere I hope I can remember this thread.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I did an extensive search for legible serif fonts yesterday and stumbled
    upon a few likely suspects that could have been used as a starting point.  Although
    each one would need specific unlogical customisation to achieve the exact result
    (not considering the f), i think Valfieris by Insigne comes quite close.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/valfieris/regular/\r\n\r\nThe
    serif details would need to be straightened and skewed a little on the ascenders,
    and its not as condensed as the logo but still the k is remarkably similar.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the mystery of custom font logo, I think the answer lies in the fact that
    hairdressers may have friends who are doing graphic design, and therefor can have
    a nice logo done for cheap. \r\n\r\nI wish I could remember where i found this
    image though..could shed more light onto the whereabouts of the salon itself or
    the designers.."

  body: "Mike, I found the source:  http://subtype.org/modified/\r\n\r\nit's in their
    modified section, so it's definitely a customised font, not all original.  Ive
    mailed Subtype asking to shed light onto this for us, but unfortunately they haven't
    replied :("
