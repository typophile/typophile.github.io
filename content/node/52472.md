  body: This is a little too obvious and it feels a little cheesy. Why not use a hyper-condensed
    face for CRUNCH?

  body: Well, expressive type is supposed to be obvious. I don't have the condensed
    version of it, there's no "hyper-condensed" version. Even if I did use a more
    condensed version, it wouldn't be expressive type.

  body: "I like it so far.\r\n\"Crunch\" suggest a gravelly, particulate quality as
    well as compression. (Think snow beneath feet, granola.)\r\nCould you add that?"

  body: It doesn't feel very expressive yet. The word "crunch" feels shuffled or maybe
    jumbled, but nothing about it reads crunched.  Have you tried rotating a few of
    the letters vertically and really eliminating the white space between them where
    ever possible? stacking one or two of the letters, etc. Push it further, I think.

  body: You also might want to try crunching the end of the word more than the beginning
    - think of an auto crash test - the bumper is obliterated, the hood is scrunched,
    the passenger compartment is mildly dented.
