  body: "Times was the closest match I could find, but it isn't exact.\r\nThe T doesn't
    match any of the Caslons I have.\r\n\r\nThe sample is from Newsweek magazine,
    and it may well be a custom font, but I'm trying to match it as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Fenway.

  body: "The sample of 'Fenway' I see in \"The Art of Matthew Carter\" doesn't have
    a full serif on the leg of the 'k'. The font was designed for <em>Sports Illustrated</em>
    magazine, a TIME-Warner publication, which <em>Newsweek</em> is not. However,
    Mark, I think you got Matthew Carter right -- because he designed 'Vincent Text'
    for <em>Newsweek</em>, and I think that's what this is.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
