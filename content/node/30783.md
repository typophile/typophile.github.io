    Eurostile (as the reworked Microgramma is known). Could be someone digitized a
    version, but that would be in the shareware world\u2026 under a different name.
    Sorry.\r\n\r\nBTW Could be that the person you mentioned confuses Microgramma
    with its inspiration: Bank Gothic \u2014 that has a light version (Bitstream)."

    fictional) Microgramma Extended Light. And it would give you an excuse to buy
    their book, which is quite nice.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=143&subpage=viewfonts"

    Extended</a> light enough?
