  ITC Garamond by typesetting the word 'Helvetica' in the serif face. I always found
  this to be quite funny even though I have issues with how Garamond looks - it's
  an interesting look into the discourse on type that was going on in that period.\r\n\r\nI
  have attempted to recreate this 1979 classic on a t-shirt - it can be found here:

  body: "ITC Garamond is among the least derivative of all Garamond revivals, so \"new\"
    was quite appropriate.\r\n\r\nIronically, your Tee concept ain't even \"new\",
    but a 100% rip-off (unless you have OK'd/licensed the idea from Mr Summerford/ITC,
    in which case my apologies for the diss).\r\n\r\nThis kind of swipe would have
    been more respectful of intellectual property:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers.jpg]"

  body: "> ITC Garamond is among the least derivative of all Garamond revivals\r\n\r\nTrue...
    although that makes it sound like it was a good idea.  :-)\r\n\r\nBut since ITC
    Garamond is indeed \"the least derivative\", a <cite>really</cite>\r\nsophisticated
    joke would be to set such a shirt in... ITC Garamond!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Because we are such type geeks, we forget the bigger picture sometimes.\r\n\r\n<em>Switzerland\u2019s
    official name is Confoederatio Helvetica (Latin for \u201CHelvetic Confederation\u201D),
    which is frequently translated in English as Swiss Confederation. The Helvetii,
    an ancient Celtic people who occupied what is now western Switzerland, were defeated
    by the Roman army of Julius Caesar in the 1st century bc. As a province of Rome,
    the region became known as Helvetia. The name Confoederatio Helvetica, an ethnically
    and linguistically neutral term that recalls this ancient history, is testimony
    to an enduring desire to forge unity among a diverse population.</em>\r\n\r\nCharles
    Heatwole, B.A., M.S., Ph.D.\r\nProfessor of Geography, Hunter College, New York.
    He is author of <em>Switzerland: Confoederatio Helvetica</em> and coauthor of
    <em>Geography for Travel and Tourism</em>.\r\n\r\nSo unless you are intending
    to show a specimen of the typeface Helvetica, setting the official name \"HELVETICA\"
    using Helvetica is actually a design clich\xE9... nothing that we visually sophisticated
    typophiles would dream of. ;-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvet_Chemica.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvet_Aqua.gif]"
