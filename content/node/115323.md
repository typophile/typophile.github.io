body: I've been using InDesign (and before that, PageMaker -- back to Aldus 2.0) for
  quite some time and the one thing that bothers me is that, somewhere along the line,
  the devs seemed to think it was a good idea to get rid of the option to set margins
  and columns for each page in a 2-page spread separately. At least, they dropped
  the option from the Layout > Margins and Columns... menu. Is there another option
  available, or do I have to keep wishing for my old PageMaker back? Thanks in advance.

    the left page of the spread (as in the screen shot below), then set the margins
    and columns. Then select the icon for the right page of the spread and set the
    margins and columns for it.\r\n\r\nThis works for CS 5.5 for Mac; might be different
    in other versions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pages_6313.jpg]"
