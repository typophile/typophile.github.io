  body: "Derision does not help to promote dialogue and understanding.\r\n\r\nBut
    it is necessary to understand <em>why</em> little else but derision is the reaction
    to your recommendation concerning the shape of the 11th letter in the Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\nYour
    stated reason for changing the letter is that its current shape promotes suicidal
    thoughts because it resembles a junction of rivers where a famous battle between
    Gods took place, as recorded in Hindu scriptures.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority
    of users of the Latin alphabet are not believing members of the Hindu faith. So,
    to them, this is <strong>not a reason</strong>.\r\n\r\nLatin alphabet users are
    usually Christians; Christianity takes a different view of other faiths than Hinduism
    does. Hinduism is <em>syncretistic</em>; that is, if the Muslims say that an angel
    came down and spoke to Muhammad, or the Jews say that God parted the Red Sea so
    that their ancestors could escape slavery in Egypt, Hindus generally don't feel
    a need to say that these things didn't actually happen.\r\n\r\nThe view taken
    by Christianity (and related religions such as Judaism and Islam) towards other
    faiths is very different. They believe that their holy books are the <em>sole
    and exhaustive</em> record of all interactions between humanity and the Divine.\r\n\r\nIf
    it isn't in the Bible, it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nOutside the Bible, of course,
    most of the purely natural events of human history took place. Possibly black
    magic, done by Satan and his demons, could also occasionally take place - some
    Christians believe this to be possible, others do not accept this as a possibility
    Christians should accept.\r\n\r\nSo anything miraculous that is not in the Bible,
    or that doesn't promote Christianity (or, before Christ, Judaism) - since some
    Christian faiths do accept the idea of their present-day saints performing miracles
    in addition to those recorded in the Bible - is either something that never happened,
    but was simply a made-up human legend, or it was an example of the dark powers
    of the demons of Hell.\r\n\r\nOther religions may teach people to respect their
    parents, to be faithful to their spouses, not to steal or do violence. But in
    no other religions but their own is the presence and power of God made manifest.\r\n\r\nSo
    the traditions of Hinduism say there is something wrong with the shape of the
    11th letter of our alphabet. Since we are not ourselves Hindus, and since our
    own religious outlook is the opposite of syncretistic, we do not consider the
    teachings of the Hindu faith to have the kind of value - as accurate history,
    or authentic revelation - to be in any way useful as a source of new information,
    in addition to that which we have from reason, that could serve as a guide to
    action.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, people here see <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>
    to exert the slightest effort to change the forms of their alphabet, but you present
    your proposed change in a way that implies that it's obvious that we should see
    the merit in this idea, they wonder why you can't see what's obvious to them -
    that your rationale for this change has no substance.\r\n\r\n@T\xE9 Rowan:\r\nThe
    foregoing may address your point somewhat as well.\r\n\r\nBecause Hinduism is
    a syncretistic faith, Hindus have no problem in believing that Jesus might have
    been a genuine Avatar, and worked genuine miracles. And, so, while they wouldn't
    convert to Christianity because of it, they might well accept that Christian scriptures
    also contain some real messages from God - and so they might accept, for example,
    the new information that the number 666 is unlucky, instead of reacting the way
    <em>we</em> do to things from other faiths - if it isn't our religion, it's purely
    human superstition, nothing more."

  body: "Some Christians (of which I am not) might well decide in their narrowmindedness
    that the swinging stroke in U+0915 stands for <em>The</em> Serpent, and the whole
    glyph therefore stands for the Triumph of Evil.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned,
    U+0915 and U+004B are no more and no less evil than any other glyph anywhere else,
    with no need to replace one with the other. To be good/evil, you must be sapient
    and able to tell the difference between good and evil. Said difference is a variable,
    not a constant.\r\n\r\nIn practice, there is also inertia. 'K' is perfectly adequate,
    so why change? Same with the nagari glyph, U+0915. Why change what works when
    there is nothing (obvious) to gain?"

    complexities of differing religious viewpoints -- even ignoring the likely high
    percentage of agnostics and atheists among British Linux tweeters -- are especially
    relevant. The proposal here is to change a letter in a writing system, part of
    the cultural heritage of many millions of people, to a letter borrowed from another
    writing system, part of the cultural heritage of many millions of other people,
    because of an <em>unfounded</em> belief that the letter prompts suicidal thoughts
    because of an association with the shape of the confluence of some rivers of which
    the majority of readers are unaware and which, if one looks at a map, the letter
    K doesn''t actually look that much like. This belief has nothing to do with Hinduism:
    it is an idiosyncratic obsession of one man.'

    a K, but doesn't contain offending intersection? At least then you'd have backwards
    compatibility. The K you intend to use as a replacement doesn't harmonize with
    the Latin alphabet.

  body: "@John Hudson:\r\nIt is true that, as far as I am aware, no other Hindus have
    felt the need to advocate reform of the Latin alphabet. Thus, even when A. C.
    Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was alive, <em>Back to Godhead</em> magazine was
    typeset in plain old ordinary Times Roman with no alterations to the characters.\r\n\r\nMy
    \"over-analysis\", though, had one specific purpose - to reach that one man. The
    issue about Hinduism being syncretistic has nothing to do with the alphabet reform
    <em>per se</em>, it has to do with why the response to the proposal is so dismissive
    and even derisive.\r\n\r\nBecause it is true that it is natural in Hinduism to
    take the legends in the scriptures of non-Hindu religions more seriously than
    it is normal in Christianity to take the content of non-Christian faiths seriously.
    If he is aware of this cultural fact, then he will be less surprised at not being
    taken seriously, and less likely to attribute the disinterest he encounters to
    causes such as racism."

    that the rationale he gives for his proposed reform will not appear to have any
    validity whatever to people here - and, thus, when he advances such a reform on
    such a rationale, and gives every appearance of expecting other people to take
    it seriously, he will be regarded as less than intelligent and less than rational.\r\n\r\nIt
    may be that a cultural factor is contributing to the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    his use of a Sansqrit letter was because it was what he had handy, as a placeholder.
    But instead of designing a new letter, there is a much simpler way to achieve
    what he wishes.\r\n\r\nSimply use the letter Q to replace the 11th letter of the
    alphabet. And where Q is currently used, replace QU by CW, which is a combination
    not in use. That way, there would be no cwestion about which words are intended.
    Of course, languages other than English might need a different spelling reform.\r\n\r\nAnd
    where the letter Q is used in transliterations from Arabic or Persian, replace
    it by QQ. Thus, one might have \"When the <em>baidaqq</em> reaches the eighth
    rank, it is promoted to a <em>firzan</em>\", or one might refer to the <em>Qit\u0101b
