body: "I'm writing a series of Web Typography tutorials for the site <a href=\"http://www.wpdesigner.com\">WPDesigner.com</a>.
  The first one was a brief tutorial on some of the basics about column widths. My
  next tutorial will be about line-spacing, then about the use of color.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to have a critique of my first <a href=\"http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/06/19/web-typography-column-widths/\">tutorial</a>
  if anyone has the time. I want it to be as easily understood as possible, but without
  being overly boring.\r\n\r\nThe main point of my tutorials will be to get web designers,
  specifically Wordpress theme designers, to focus on the importance of typography.
  \r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas on tutorials I should write that would be beneficial
  to the blogging community as a whole?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: The only comment I can make is that shorter pages are more appealing to the
    web browser, and a tutorial of this type seems too long. I suspect that your blog
    format prevents you from splitting it into more easily digested chunks (I would
    say 6 to 8 would be ideal). If you move it from the blog to HTML pages, you might
    want to consider chunking it.
