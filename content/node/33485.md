  body: "Love the mark and the colors!\r\n\r\nFor how tight you've spaced the letters
    in \"Dave Bailey\", the word spacing isn't tight enough. (I do think you've spaced
    it too tightly for the typeface.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the em-dashes surrounding
    your titles.\r\n\r\nThe three lines that follow need more line-spacing.\r\n\r\nI'm
    might consider make your name smaller and try left-justifying instead of right.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about the white outline on the back. Or the white box for that matter.
    Gratuitous maybe? What if you just had the two lines/boxes of color? This would
    echo the logo and be more subtle.\r\n"

  body: "Ah, lovely quick response! The mark came from a bunch of doodling I did in
    the margins of my notebook, imagine that!\r\n\r\nI was wondering about it being
    too tight, the glyph designs have unique serif designs and as such I couldn't
    make up my mind if it was ok to overlap them. There was even a slight mod. to
    the leg of the _L_ for spacing reasons...I'll rethink my name.\r\n\r\nMaybe I
    should stick to original ideas and stop thinking so much, that's what I did with
    the mark. The back was originally just the two colors, like you suggested.\r\n\r\nI
    shall report back!"

    sure your choice of typeface reflects the interesting logo you have designed yourself.
    I like your logo design and think you could also push the layout a bit further.
    \r\n\r\nAs a starting point I like the way the logo sits on the front, however
    I think you could be a bit more adventurous with the layout of the text, maybe
    reflect the shape of the logo a bit more... don't be afraid of leaving white space?
    Maybe overlap some of the text on top of the logo in the way that the 'd' and
    'b' interact with each other?\r\n\r\nThe back does'nt match the design you have
    on the front, maybe keep it simple like the front without the text, or an abstract
    version of the logo?"

  body: ">contrast in typography is of utmost importance\r\n\r\nI agree. Here I think
    you might introduce more by making the web addresses and phone number significantly
    smaller, and putting them lower, so the card is really about who you are and what
    you do. \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that this other stuff can be small because the reader
    is not going to read it, but only use it if and when he or she wants to contact
    you. I like the logo too. It more easily reads \"db\" when small, so you might
    want it small on the other side somehow. "

    didn''t know if going below 9pt on a biz card would be in poor form. There''s
    the logo small on the back of the first PDF if you didn''t see that. Thanks for
    taking time to observe my work!'

  body: Oh, my mistake, I was looking at it full screen, which is deceiving. The 9
    pt may be ok, but then maybe the other should be bigger--or perhaps the info just
    less leading and moved more distant. I don't know the best way but they look a
    bit too equal to me. On the first one, the back, the competition of the logo with
    the stripes confuses the eye, so the db isn't so apparant. Again at true size
    just on the front it is probably fine...

    the right, kerning between Da, Ba, around & Ty and po seem a touch loose, the
    interline spacing needs some work. And, to agree with Belleisle, I don\u2019t
    see why you cannot or should not interact type with image, you have already defined
    white areas with the logo, to the left and the counter, and almost aligned the
    addresses with the x-height.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "You are working on an asymmetric balance here. I like the right alignment,
    but to me your latest is too heavy to the left. To balance the big logo I am guessing
    you need to push the text to the right and let more white space pull against the
    logo. You can play with sizes and placements here until it clicks. \r\n\r\nFor
    examples of good asymmetric balance see the great stuff of Hokusai, or in typography
    early Tschichold. \r\n\r\nAlso the IL in your name is too tight compared to the
    the rest. I think you might find the text will work better if everything is in
    a bolder weight, possibly caps smaller, and the caps more widely spaced. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You may consider aligning the division of the color fields on the back with
    the x-height of your logo on the front. Currently, these elements are very close
    to aligning. So close that it seems like they should align. \r\n\r\nDoing this
    would mean moving the division downward, possibly making the back of the card
    appear top heavy or accidentally off-center. So perhaps this is a bad choice.
    I just thought it was worth pointing out to you."

    I''m working with asymmetric design here. The continuation of the grid from the

    design guarantees that the design will remain punchy. I am a fan of dot with phone
