body: 'Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how many of you are aware what
  has happened in Vancouver yesterday. <BR> <BR>Because I&#39;m a typophile regular
  of sorts I wanted to use this forum to inform you of some views and make mention
  that The GDC &#40;Society of Graphic Designers of Canada&#41; and members, Canadian
  designers alike are all in the midst of a very big mess and wish for your support
  in letters or emails. The address to write to is <a href="mailto:design@vancouver2010.com">design@vancouver2010.com</a>.
  Anyone who is a member of AIGA, ICOGRADA or any other country association would
  be helpful in our mission because frankly this is an international issue - one that
  the Olympic Committee may continue to implement in the future if not stopped now.  <BR>
  <BR>Background: <BR>VANOC &#40;Vancover Olympic Committee for 2010&#41; and Mr.
  John Furlong &#40;Chair&#41; has decided that it should be a wonderful idea to open
  a beauty contest for the next Olympic emblem - open to anyone 19 years of age and
  older. Their definition of  a &#34;professional&#34; at the press conference. They
  are asking for entrants to attend a design conference for a fee of $150, - the submissions
  are &#34;free&#34; and the winning design to be granted $25,000 - an insult for
  such an organization.   <BR> <BR>The 2010 Winter Olympic Committee has really launched
  this CONTEST to design the <BR>logo! I got wind of it through our GDC listserve
  and the news. Some senior GDC members, Yves Rouselle, <BR>Matt Warburton and Jim
  Skipp along with Pamela Lee attended the press <BR>conference. As you can imagine
  all hell broke loose. The press and <BR>the Olympic Committee don&#39;t get it.
  They think we are all hobbyists, that we run craft shops. <BR> <BR>As Canadian designers;
  members of the associations, we abide by strict by-laws prohibiting us from speculative
  work much in the same way the AIGA and ICOGRADA agree that spec work is exploitative
  and benefits no one. We are mounting a force to hit the press; our president, Matt
  Warbuton has been on the news and radio in the last 24 hours, in an effort to stop
  all this. <BR> <BR>You can read more here: <BR><a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040514/OLYMPICLOGO14//?query=2010"
  target="_blank">http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040514/OLYMPICLOGO14//?query=2010</a>
  <BR> <BR>You can see the VANOC info here: <BR><a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/design"
  target="_blank">www.vancouver2010.com/design</a> <BR> <BR>We look forward to hearing
  one day soon that the 2010 <BR>committee realized their error in judgement and puts
  out a proper RFP thanks <BR>to the design education of real professionals everywhere.
  <BR> <BR>You know how much of an insult this is. I would appreciate that this thread
  not be wasted on debate of speculative work and related issues and/or whether the
  idea has merit or not.  <BR> <BR>Simply if you support the idea that what VANOC
  is doing is wrong please send a letter.  <BR> <BR>As our BC Chapter Secretary, Mr
  Sigrid Albert, MGDC put it:  <BR> <BR><i>I want to register my opposition to the
  Olympics &#34;emblem&#34; design competition  <BR>as well. I propose that the VANOC
  is a&#41; lazy, b&#41; cheap, and c&#41; ignorant. <BR> <BR>a&#41; Lazy, because
  they seem to believe they will save themselves time by not  <BR>going through a
  proper RFP and preselection of qualified studios. IMO, the  <BR>only way to hold
  a professional competition, if they must have one, is to  <BR>select a handful of
  studios after review of qualifications, give time for  <BR>briefing and questions
  to each studio, establish a budget for each studio to  <BR>submit a design, and
  commit to the full design development process with the  <BR>winning studio at a
  price established through a proposal by the winning  <BR>studio, not an amount of
  VANOC&#39;s choosing. Sounds like a lot of work though.  <BR>Better have an open
  contest &#40;and don&#39;t kid yourselves, anyone who thinks  <BR>themselves a designer
  will participate!&#41; and sift through 1,000 entries for  <BR>weeks or months.
  But wait, what about the time it takes to establish a  <BR>selection committee,
  and criteria for selection? Or let&#39;s just skip all that  <BR>- maybe it&#39;ll
  be a daughter-in-law of Mr. Furlong who will make the final  <BR>choice? Jane has
  always been very artistic! <BR> <BR>c&#41; Cheap, because they think they will save
  money holding an open  <BR>competition. As Mr. Furlong correctly points out, he
  can&#39;t pay 1,000  <BR>designers for their entries. But apparently he thinks that
  just by the sheer  <BR>quantity of entries a winning design has got to be in there
  somewhere, like  <BR>a needle in a haystack? Maybe it will be, but will Jane find
  it? And what  <BR>about the process of making the emblem work with its many applications?
  A  <BR>professional firm with significant capabilities will have to be hired at  <BR>that
  point - at equally significant expense which will make the original  <BR>prize seem
  rather small in comparison - to make the winning emblem &#34;work&#34;.  <BR>At
  the very latest, a proper selection process will have to be established  <BR>then.
  Why not now? <BR> <BR>b&#41; Ignorant, because of the above wrong assumptions. Ignorant,
  because they  <BR>think design is a talent, is just a brief moment of inspiration,
  and does  <BR>not also require education, experience, and hard work. Ignorant, because  <BR>they
  are calling it an &#34;illustration&#34; &#40;according to the Globe and Mail  <BR>article&#41;,
  not a logo, a brand, or an identity.</i> <BR> <BR>Thanks for the floor. <BR>-t <BR>

    How about a simple explanation of the value of professional branding services?

    think that having a logo contest is a great idea,  <BR>because they can see a

  body: Hi, Tanya. <BR> <BR>I have to say that I agree with Darrel. I think that calling
    a spade a spade, as you say, might work against your purposes, purposes I completely
    support. If we, as graphic designers, are to win these people over, we won&#39;t
    get much sympathy or even a willingness to be heard out by calling them lazy,
    cheap and ignorant. <BR> <BR>btw, I do think that it&#39;s important to write
    them and try to educate them a bit about all this. If they are flooded with letters
    from all over it might just make them think a bit about what they&#39;re doing
    here.

  body: Ricardo - I understand but that&#39;s just an example of one&#39;s person&#39;s
    views - one that I tend to agree with. There are many &#34;official&#34; letters
    being sent &#40;perhaps I should have waited and posted one of them&#41; but as
    well as personal letters from designers across Canada right now - everyone should
    write. I&#39;m not spear-heading here, just wanted to get the word out to other
    designers who care and want to write.  <BR> <BR>Right now, it seems that VANOC
    is corresponding and replying some letters. Of this reply that I&#39;ve read it
    would seem that they aren&#39;t really taking this seriously yet. If they get
    away with it this time imagine the ramifications in years to come, and the public&#39;s
    perception of our industry.  <BR> <BR>Instead of critiquing ourselves how about
    we just start doing something - anything - what-ever you can - do it however you
    want - but just so something if you care enough , there&#39;s not a whole lot
    of time to waste here.

  body: good point Hrant, one I hadn&#39;t thought of. - I&#39;ll share your comment
    with the association.  <BR> <BR>By opening an exchange with them now I would hope
    that we may avoid the situation - but we may not - but having them be scared of
    us afterwards won&#39;t help resolve the situation now - well unless we leak the
    idea to protest afterwards as well - which would most likely happen in any case
    if this went through. <BR> <BR>Still - we have one iron ladel - maybe not the
    biggest, but the fact that they are inviting &#42;us&#42; as professionals and
    student designers to submit - meanwhile very few - very very few are  able to
    - &#40;by-laws&#41; and of those non-members many have good heads on their shoulders
    and wouldn&#39;t work on spec. It&#39;s just strange that they would think this
    could fly in Canada - one of 2 &#40;?&#41; who have accreditation. Really if they
    say part of the idea to hold a contest was for us - they obviously didn&#39;t
    do much homework, it&#39;s hard to imagine who&#39;s running the show over there.
    <BR> <BR>If they get by I fear the perception the rest of the public has - it&#39;s
    more a matter of respect in the end, one that hopefully could come from being
    proactive in a positive manner.
