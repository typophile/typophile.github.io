  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The graffiti culture is one that has surrounded me fairly consistently in the past. However, It&rsquo;s one avenue of lettering that I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of, myself. Despite the playful, energetic personality that surrounds street artists, there exists a heavy weight that keeps the amateur from breaking into the scene. Street credit exists, and the street is the street after all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the incredible pleasure of visiting 5 Points in Queens, New York on two occasions. Recommendation: if you&rsquo;ve never been there, get there; this paint-consumed warehouse is one of NYC&rsquo;s best kept secrets. Since my first visit, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of research on the progress of street art in all form, I&rsquo;ve picked the brain of a few friends and acquaintances immersed in the East coast culture - and mind you, they take their identities very seriously. Artists from all around flock to 5 Points for a chance to claim a few square feet of wall space. The location is almost like a who&rsquo;s who or hall of fame documentation, with names and styles of all kinds on display, and an urban setting that&rsquo;s absolutely prone to photo and video shoots - one of which was staged and executed during my second visit. I still don&rsquo;t know what is inside of the warehouse, but I&rsquo;d like to visualize endless drafting tables and artists plotting their next attack!</p>

While many of the more outstanding pieces on display leave most people dumbfounded and sweating to understand the lettering structure, the main attraction of my post is actually focused on a 50-second scrawl on paper with a chisel tip Sharpie marker. As much respect as I can muster up for the brilliant ensembles of color, pattern, form and depth displayed under bridges and along freight train cars, I find myself most genuinely in love with what are referred to as hand styles. These are easier to come by, most common in urban and developed cities, usually quick - sometimes sloppy - but always intriguing and often peppered with a bit of calligraphic influence. Street artists who focus on graffiti concentrate on what would be considered their &lsquo;signature&rsquo; which in this case is the hand style. In addition to the always-evolving demonstrations of their urban paintings, the hand style is something that is their own, and something that hopefully will become instantaneously recognizable among their peers with just a glance. FAUST is one such artist whose style was introduced to me just recently, and who I feel deserves some attention.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the first minute of this clip: ([[http://tinyurl.com/n9f23t]]). What caught my attention was less about the outcome, but more about the evolution of the lettering. As simple as it may seem, this technique of carving with a chisel tip goes way back and flirts with both black letter and calligraphy. Not to mention the relationship between the letters maintains a certain balance that this signature needs, which you don&rsquo;t always find as often as you&rsquo;d expect. The bold strokes and subtle curves create instant shapes that most graphic artists strive for with the pen tool and a number of - if not too many - bézier points, and if I had the same control that FAUST demonstrates in this clip, I would be a happy man! With practice, this technique can certainly be established, but for now the spotlight is on the awe that I fell under while watching this artist go to work on paper.</p>
