  I came to this\r\nsite in search of an answer. I have been using Illustrator and
  Photoshop\r\ntrying to create 3D typography and it seems to not be going in the
  right \r\ndirection. Can anyone tell me what programs were used to create text like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ec2.pinterest.com/550x/0c/af/db/0cafdbe637cb6b8af36c66aadc1d50dd.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ec3.pinterest.com/550x/33/14/d4/3314d4d8196f3702fe5b779cd65ead57.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: That is definitely done in a 3D program and they used a fair amount of ambient
    occlusion. You can create passable 3D text in Photoshop and Illustrator these
    days, but it will not have the slightly rounded edges you showed in your examples.

      but I really want to get into\r\ndoing more experimental 3D rendered type. Seems
      like all these programs are quite pricey though (and I'm still in college) I'll
      have check out this Xara program for sure!"

  body: "About 30 seconds in Cinema 4D:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Albertina_3573.jpg]\r\nIn
    your second example, again, any 3D program would work. In C4D, one would use Mograph.
    From his comments, I would guess he used C4D and a step effector. (you can use
    Google and see what that does on youtube.\r\n\r\nBTW, Maya, Softimage, and 3Ds
    max are free for educational use. Blender is free even if you are not in school.
    I have used them all, but prefer C4D as I do most of my work on a Mac, and it
    is the most stable on OSX."

  body: 'You are showing your age. FWIW, pretty much all the 3D programs will create
    equivalent output for this sort of thing (Autodesk programs, Modo, Lightwave,
    Houdini, Xara, and so on). If you learn the techniques in one, the ability to
    learn another is not that hard. It is only on higher end issues where programming
    is needed or one is dealing with animating millions of objects that there are
    substantial differences in what one can do. After one learns the theory, it is
    mostly just figuring out where the commands or menus are to do what one wants. '

  body: "IsleofGough is right, that can be done in any 3d program really.\r\n\r\nFor
    my example, I used C4D and render using Vray. As both IsleofGough and 5star said,
    it's a step effector applied to a cloner \u2014 the step effector allows me to
    change the size of the A, along with rotating it a little with each clone."

  body: "Nice work and good rendering. That takes some skill and experience. The designs
    are good and knowing the mechanics of a 3d program does not substitute for that.
    (Especially good is the \"C\") Trying to do this thing outside of a real 3d program
    is an exercise in frustration. The only exception is zaxwerks in after effects.
    The cheats in proanimator are easy and look pretty good.\r\n\r\nBtw, for those
    wanting good enough without learning any 3d, http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CvtluKm6P-0
    is not bad. It will not give final gathering, bump, displacements, advanced materials,
    advanced control of bevels, area lighting, etc, but it is good for a commonly
    owned program."
