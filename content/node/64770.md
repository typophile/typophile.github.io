  body: "The Merrymount (not Merrymond) was Daniel Berkeley Updike's --of Printing
    Types undying fame-- company, founded in Boston in 1896 and apparently the most
    important enterprise aligned with the Arts & Crafts movement in the USA.\r\n\r\nThis
    beautiful and dark Venetian style type design was commissioned from Goodhue when
    Updike decided to move away from historical printing in the William Morris vein.\r\n\r\nI'm
    unaware if there is a digital version."

  body: "What an interesting suggestion, even though Monotype's Italian Old Style
    seems to be overall much lighter in colour.\r\n\r\nA low resolution image doesn't
    allow much leeway, but I'm guessing that not only is Merrymount's colour notably
    darker but that machine printing pressure has made it even more so.\r\n"

    is a low-contrast Venetian face.\r\n\r\nA technique to mimic the serious press
    gain: apply a small amount of Stroke in InDesign.\r\nYou might try this with a
    variety of Venetian faces, to see if any come close to this look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Comparing Merrymount on the one hand to the types of William Morris, and
    on the other hand to the various modern Venetians that are well known, I have
    to say that I find Merrymount to be the one that has the greatest authenticity
    combined with acceptability to modern tastes that I've seen.\r\n\r\nIf Merrymount
    isn't available in digital, it should be."

  body: I didn't look quite closely enough at that specimen. Seeing the somewhat longer
    sample in Updike, I see that it does have one flaw from my viewpoint - the design
    of the lowercase t is eccentric. In all else, though, it seems to be the best
    Venetian I've seen, even though many of the fonts in that category are beautiful.
