body: "Greater Albion Typefounders has just released Clementhorpe on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/clementhorpe/
  | MyFonts.com]].\r\n\r\nClementhorpe is inspired by the lettering on an early 20th
  century enamel advertisement-for chocolate. From the dozen or so hand drawn letters
  found in that source we have constructed a family of Roman faces for display and
  text work, with bold weights, an italic form as well as condensed, small capital
  and title forms, all (hopefully!) preserving the fun of their inspiration.  Here's
  a sample of Clementhorpe 'in action':\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clementhorpe_Gallery1_3851.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've
  just posted further samples on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\nWe
  intend the Clementhorpe family to provide a complete solution for early 20th century
  inspired design work with Character, offering all the faces needed to complete a
  project or a range of projects within the one type family. \r\n\r\nThis is our largest
  family to date, with twelve faces-one of which, the italic form, is available free
  on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/clementhorpe/ | MyFonts.com]].  "
