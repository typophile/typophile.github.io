body: "In a thread today I wanted to refer to John Downer's ideas about revivals etc
  which are available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2\r\n\r\nBut
  before I found them there I went looking in the wiki for some shorter possibly more
  general treatement of the ideas ( many of which were in use before his article)
  in some form there. I could not find anything at all. Which seems really silly.
  I started to think about working on it myself but then I realized I aught to chat
  with the many & sundry about it before I tried. \r\n\r\nSo here is my proposal :
  It seems like some set of categories ( heavily indebted I suspect to John Downer)
  would be reall useful to have in the wiki. I am not keen on using his categories
  'as is' in part because that seems like stealing, but also because that would be
  lazy. We aught to come to a consensus of our own. This does not preculude using
  his work as a point to jump off from. To that end here is his list: \r\n\r\nRevivals/Recuttings/Reclamations\r\nAnthologies/Surveys/Remixes
  \r\nKnockoffs/Clones/Counterfeits \r\nReconsiderations/Reevaluations/Reinterpretations\r\nHomages/Tributes/Paeans\r\nEncores/Sequels/Reprises
  \r\nExtensions/Spinoffs/Variations \r\nCaricatures/Parodies/Burlesques\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    his categories. (The whole point of his essay was to spread these designations.)
    But you're right to ask Typophiles to agree on our own set of terms since this
    is such a controversial topic.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to wade through some unrelated
    bits, there was some <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000511.php\">discussion on
    Downer's piece at Typographica</a>."

    own experience</a> with trying to come to terms with classifications. that is
    not to say that we shouldn't try to classify things and that multiple systems
    can't coexist. i think [[typeface classification schemes|classification systems]]
    are useful, but at some point they all break down. but not trying to derail your
    topic, i think that many of Downer's terms are generic enough to use without getting
    into trouble. My own preferences would probably be:\r\nrevivals\r\nanthologies\r\nclones\r\nreinterpretations\r\nhomages\r\n???\r\nextensions
    (variations seems to me to belong more with reinterpretations)\r\nparodies\r\n\r\nthis
    may still be too many, for example, aren't parodies simply exaggerated reinterpretations,
    for example would Farnham be a reinterp or a caricature of Fleischman?\r\n\r\njust
    2 cents to get the ball rolling...\r\n\r\nfunny thing, i was just thinking today
    of going back to some of the classification pages in the wiki and adding terms
    pages so that browsers could find typefaces based on different descriptions. i
    wish our wiki was more dynamic with categories as is wikipedia, that would make
    doing something like this much easier. *sigh*"

    to faithfully revive a typeface in a different medium. With every other kind of

  body: this is a bit confusing for me. i need to understand the difference between
    naieve/non-historical and novel/new design. i feel these might be considered the
    same??? also, i might move revivals up one level because althought it IS interpretive,
    i think in the strictest sense TRY to be as faithful as possible to the source.
    so perhaps there is no such thing as a revival, per se, because we can never truly
    recapture the original artist's intention. even if there is a metal version and
    a digital version by the same designer, they will essentially be different animals.

  body: "I guess what I was getting at here ( or trying to ) is that typeface design
    exists outside of John's categories too. One area outside of John categories is
    novel design. Admttedly there isn't much of it & some might argue that even a
    novel design is only just so novel if it can be read... but I think it's a valid
    construct for the purposes of discussion. I also think that an area unexplored
    by John's categories is with the how aware the designer is of type already and
    specifically with the form they are working in. For example Template Gothic was
    basically a new design but the designer was ( I supect) grounded in some type
    history. But if you have for instance a student & they start making type out of
    squares & half circles they may or may not be aware of the hitorical prescedents
    - and assuming they are not; they may make what is essentially a naive design
    which looks derivative but is non-historical in conception. As I say these are
    rare instances for the most part but it we are building a hierarchy of categories
    maybe these aspects should have a place in it. Maybe not. \r\n\r\n<cite> might
    move revivals up one level </cite>\r\n\r\nMaybe so. I was imbivalent about creating
    a category with subcats. Maybe the Super catgory 'Interpretive' isn't helpful."

    \r\nClosely based on characters from various fonts all cut by one person, or cut
    by various hands, all working in one particular style or genre-like a medley or

  body: well, it's not a complete typeface yet, but Junius is meant to sample from
    several typefaces of Menhart. Someday I'd also like to do a Goudy homage and put
    everything that I think is good about Goudy into one type family (well maybe not
    <em>everything</em>). i think i would use Homage where Downer uses Anthologies
    and vice versa, but i'm not sure there is a significant difference between these
    two categories.

    But yes, the titles are all pretty close. Too close. In fact Tiff''s comment has
    me thinking that my efforts to frame the ideas for wiki use are not going to work
    well enough to be worth doing. Maybe the most useful, accurate thing to do would
    be to create an entry on: ''John Downer''s type classification from his article
    "Call it what it is" '' and then paste in what he wrote. Then the attribution
    is there. Or simply link to the article. I am saying this because in responding
    to people''s comments it wasn''t the titles he chose that were helpful really
    - it was the descriptions of each kind of intent in making a face that I needed. '

  body: "Eben --\r\n\r\nRe: Anthologies -- I believe what John had in mind are designs
    like Matthew Carter's Galliard, which MC has stated was not an attempt to recreate
    any one specific Granjon typeface, but an amalgam or distillation of various Granjon
    characteristics based on long and careful study. \r\n\r\nThe same could be said,
    to a certain extent, of Robert Slimbach's Adobe Garamond, which again was not
    an attempt to recreate a specific font of Garamond's, but a distillation of various
    Garamond sizes and characteristics. (This is the case with Carol Twombly's Adobe
    Caslon also.) In contrast, the later Garamond Premier is Slimbach's return to
    the same source material with the intention of a much more faithful revival of
    specific sizes of Garamond's fonts. \r\n\r\n-- K."
