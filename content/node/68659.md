  each paragraph. I like the visual break this provides. Should I have a 12pt space
  after each item in the list? Sometimes this looks too much.\r\n\r\nI'm working to
  a 12pt baseline grid so it seems that the space should either be 12pt to match my
  grid, or nothing.\r\n\r\nAny tips/design examples?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "Thanks for this, have given this a go and things are looking good.\r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering though if it matters that using 6pt after my bullets means that I can't
    snap them to my 12pt baseline grid. There seem to be a few flowon effects I'm
    not happy with.\r\n\r\nBasically, all of my headings and paragraphs (except my
    newly spaced bullets) are snapped to the baseline grid.\r\n\r\nUsing 6pt spacing
    means the bullets vary from the baseline grid. This looks OK to me, but it creates
    an inconsistency in the amount of space before headings and paragraphs directly
    below my bullet points, which are snapped to the baseline.\r\n\r\nIs this an issue?
    Is there another approach I could take with my paragraph spacing? I don\u2019t
    really want to lose the nice structure my baseline grid provides.\r\n"

  body: "I could do, but then none of my paragraphs will align to the baseline grid

    approach a good designer would take anyway? As you might have gathered I'm fairly
    new to designing with baseline grids."

    have to pay the consequences."

  body: I tend agree with you, Cristobal, but the advice so far has been to break
    my grid! What spacing would you put after a bullet point on a 12pt grid? I did
    have 12pt after each paragraph (including bulleted lists) but this looked like
    a bit too much space for my bullets.

    correctly, but I wouldn\u2019t put any space. Just like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_4399.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,
    If you really think that you need some extra space, I\u2019d rather go for reducing
    the bullet text by one or two points.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot2_5304.jpg]"

  body: Thanks heaps, will definately be able to use these options in the future,
    although I'm not sure they will work for me for this particular project - my bullet
    points are really long, so they need some space between them, and my font size
    is already smaller than I'd like! =)

    with the alignment of any of the elements you already have on the page, but it'd
    give you a bit more freedom.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to clarify, your type would still
    be \"sitting\" on every other line. "
