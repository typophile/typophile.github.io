<div class=commentbody>Bull. <br>A project only needs a lot of money if its participants are materialistic. I remember at TypeCon when Jan Middendorp asked Saki Mafundikwa "how do you get the money to do all this?", he basically replied that nobody working on it cares too much about wealth. Some people simply don't realize that it's not money that makes the world go around, it's emotion. If you really care about quality, avoid relying on people who only care about money and not the project itself. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eventually everything falls apart or needs to be replaced. I find historic preservation to be a sometimes over-zealous pursuit. Not every building by Famous Architect needs to stand for eternity. However, I'm from Philly, which is home to just about every "first X in the United States," so I'm a bit jaded. My concern is what replaces the torn-down building. <br> <br>What <i>really</i> bothers me is the McMansion and pre-fab home craze in the U.S. Now most homes are built to be cheap and generic. I can't count the number of homes in suburbia that have one enormous wall covered in aluminum siding, with no windows, or an itty-bitty one at the very top. Bleh. Those things'll tear <i>themselves</i> down. <br> <br>::takes post-rant breath::</div>

<div class=commentbody>"The irony is..." <br> <br>There's always irony! ;o) <br> <br>Though, certainly places like the former USSR have some amazing architecture that was both built, and remained intact largely due to communism. The recent influx of capitalism there has caused a huge historical preservation battle as many, many historically and architecturally significant structures are being torn down left and right. <br> <br>Granted, the USSR's flavour of communism also had a few drawbacks in other areas ;o)</div>

<div class=commentbody>> certainly places like the former USSR have some amazing architecture <br> <br>In Yerevan, you go down to the cool, cheap and timely metro stations (which were built towards the end of the Soviet era in Armenia) and see lettering installations in large, classical Armenian caps, in bronze. You come out of the stations and are confronted by donut shops exhibiting a sick Armenian cut of Cooper Black, in vinyl. As this old geezer who hangs around Republic Square constantly heckles: "Meruh kounem angakhoutyan" = "May I f*ck independence's mother". The whole thing was an IMF ploy - now most of the big businesses (like our prized brandy) are owned by foreign interests. And did this all actually help the people of Armenia, did it "trickle down", so to speak? Of course not, because that would be bad business... <br> <br>hhp</div>
