  body: Very nice, Matha. Thank you for posting the link. I have wanted to get a better
    look at Gaelic and your link provided the oportunity. <BR> <BR>The samples were
    attractive. To my american eye they looked runic/tolkenesque.

    Better not tell Vincent that. It&#39;s supposed to look new and sleek and shiny.  <BR>
    <BR>Personally, I&#39;m over the moon that he&#39;s got it finished - the last
    time I checked it was still in progress. I&#39;ve just set a few mixed Gaelic/French/English
    texts in it and apart from the guillemets '

  body: The tolken thing is more about my ignorance  - and it relates more to the
    overall look, as opposed to the actual face. <BR> <BR>No discredit to the designer
    - nothing but respect! <BR> <BR>;&#41;

  body: The Romhanach looks nice, but the &#34;gaelic&#34; glyphs in the first version
    just look so out of place.  Plus, is there a reason behind the d, f, and g changing?  And
    are those two rs and two ts? <BR> <BR>I do like the uppercase in the plain Nuachlo.  I
    think that and the lowercase from the Romhanach would look nice together.

    <BR> <BR>Seeing it set in text it looks very nice.  It would be nice to see an
    even longer passage, however, at normal text size.  But it does have a definite
    harmony.
