  of thin slab serifs.\r\nCurrently looking for as many good (well-known) examples
  of brands that use them i their identity for several outcomes (print, UI,...)\r\n\r\nFor
  example:\r\nArcher thin for Martha Stewart\r\nVogue Brazil hairline\r\n...\r\n\r\nAny
  you can think of would be a tremendous help!\r\nTIA!!! "

    enough. A plus is it's a slab with a true italic...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100034"

  body: Sorry if I was not clear. I am not looking for thin or hairline fonts. I am
    looking for (famous) examples of those fonts in use.

  body: "If you're client is saying that any thin font is bad for reading (I mean
    more than a lines) then he's right. Showing examples of mistakes shouldn't change
    anybody's mind. Big mama Apple uses an Ultra Light now. Does that make it OK?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I suspect your argument is really about whether the importance of \"legibility\"
    is uniform and universal. Just because you wouldn't want to read a novel in it
    doesn't mean it can't be the right tool for the job. In something like a fashion
    magazine, the impact of the photographs is most important. Very light type for
    headlines and mastheads sacrifices some small measure of how <em>quickly</em>
    they can be read, to the purpose of drawing less attention away from the pictures.
    And then there's the positive thematic impressions of lightness and thinness,
    of course. As long as people <em>can</em> read it, nothing is really lost.\r\n\r\n(Apple
    has made a similar choice because they also think pictures are much more important
    than words for a computer interface, and <em>this</em> is where they're bed-shttingly
    wrong.)\r\n\r\nThe subtext of \"I'm worried people will find it hard to read\"
    is often \"I mean of course I know what it says... but other people are dumber
    than me. We want to reach even the most illiterate people.\" If your client is
    one of those who think every desirable quality can be absolutely maximized without
    regard to how the elements interact, you're in for an unpleasant time. That's
    the point where you have to give up on persuasion and either assert that you're
    the expert or concede that they're the boss."

  body: "It's worse than that: Apple thinks pictures (and music) are much more important
    than words, <em>period.</em>\r\n\r\nI certainly agree that legibility can be -and
    often is- overplayed. I guess we need to know how much text is involved (and how
    it's presented).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
