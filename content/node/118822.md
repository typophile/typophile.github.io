  1949. Now, I'd love to know whether this is original lettering or a specific typeface
  turned stone-cut sign.\r\n\r\nI can't tell for sure whether this is from that same
  time period or if it was added later but the portuguese spelling is very antiquated
  so it seems to be from around that time, if this information helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
