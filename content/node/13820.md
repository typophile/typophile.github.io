  DeVinne (1829\u20141914), printer of The Century magazine, designed a stronger,
  bolder and more readable face for the magazine and commissioned Linn Boyd Benton
  (1844\u20141932) of ATF to cut it.\r\n\r\nL.B. Benton cut it on the newly invented
  Benton punch-cutting machine and in 1895 was christened Century Roman. Afterwards,
  a companion face was created for ATF by L.B. Benton: Century no. 2, later called
  Century Broad-face. \r\n\r\nThis face became the basis for Century Expanded, designed
  by L.B.\u2019s son, [[Morris Fuller Benton]] (1872-1948) in 1902. Over the course
  of three more years, the italic, bold and bold italics were developed.\r\n\r\nThen
  after a few more years, Morris Fuller Benton developed Century Oldstyle.\r\nIn 1915,
  redevelopment of Oldstyle face began and was renamed Century Book.\r\nSoon after,
  ATF was approached by Ginn & Co., the textbook publisher, with a request for a new
  typeface for schoolbooks. M.F. Benton began review of research done at Clark University
  on the relationship between the legibility of type and the eyesight of children.\r\n\r\nConsequently,
  Benton increased the space between letters, the x-height of each letter, and the
  weight of each stroke, and balanced the color of the type by opening up the counters.
  The result was Century Schoolbook, completed in 1919.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 ATF commissioned
  [[Charles E. Hughes]] to design a new proportion for Century Expanded\u2026 the
  result, Century Nova, which was more condensed.\r\n\r\nUnder license from ATF, [[Tony
  Stan]] designed the sixteen weight ITC Century family between 1975 and 1980 for
  International Typeface Corporation. It has the characteristic large x-height of
  70s era ITC fonts. Some differences from Century are the missing serif on the lowercase
  h, m, n in the ITC. One view of ITC Century is that its color is not good at smaller
  text sizes, but its light weight is excellent at larger text sizes (eg 14 pt), especially
  the italic.\r\n\r\nNew Century Schoolbook was designed 1979-81 in the New York Lettering
  office of Merganthaler Linotype, based on Century Schoolbook. It was the second
  face, after [[New Baskerville]], that was digitized and expanded using [[Ikarus]]
  (digital technology). The [[Bitstream]] version is a near exact copy, only being
  moved from a 54 unit to a 2000 or so unit design. [[Matthew Carter]] designed the
  Greek version of New Century Schoolbook.\r\n\r\nA recent, somewhat eccentric version
  of Century School Book is Grad by [[Phil Martin]], digitized by [[Mark Simonson]].
