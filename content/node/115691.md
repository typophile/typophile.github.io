  hoping to ID this font, or if not, something very similar. Thank you. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vs-font_4472.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the help, it's highly appreciated. I'm looking for the openness
    and carefree feel that is  in the script of the VS ad. It seems that Quickpen
    may just fit the bill with that same feel. Thanks again!
