  quotes from well known designers about Univers, both positive and negative and comparing
  it to other fonts. I would particularly love info about specific letters. For instance
  in the 1957 version the ampersand is pretty hideous but in the later linotype version
  it has been changed into the more traditional & style...\r\nCan anyone help? Thank
  you so much!"

    with one of the digital versions, not sure though. Love it.

    been replaced in the versions sold to Americans ever since the original releases.
    It seems to have a better feel all around, warmer in the way a tube amplifier
    compares to a transistor amplifier. \r\n\r\nAnyway, as for getting quotes, dig
    through Swiss design books starting with the early 1960s. Univers was not all
    available in 1957, it took a few years for Deberny & Peignot and Monotype to get
    all the weights drawn, printers to buy it, and people to start using it."

    what is it that you are planning to do with these quotes?  I have been doing some
    fairly thorough research into Univers and may have some other stuf which may be
    of use to you.\r\n\r\nWil"
