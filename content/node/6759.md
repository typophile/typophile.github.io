body: OK, here is another one to add to our little things to do when your in &#40;insert
  name here&#41; section. <BR> <BR>I just booked up for a few weeks travelling around
  Italy. We are flying in to Venice and out of Rome, and plan to wander around between
  those two cities and take in Venice, Florence, Rome and maybe a trip to Sardinia.
  <BR> <BR>Anyone got any good tips for type / design / art related things or places
  to see and do? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: Well. Rome is an education in Typography in and of itself. I wouldn&#39;t
    spend less than a week there. Don&#39;t limit yourself to classical inscriptions

  body: I&#39;ve never been there, but it would seem almost a shame to pass up the
    <a href="http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~snlrc/encyclopaedia_romana/imperialfora/columna.html">Column
    of Trajan</a>. <BR> <BR>&#34;<i>...the lettering of the dedicatory inscription  is
    recognized, in terms of form and proportion, as the finest  example of Roman capitals
    and has served as the model for all  subsequent Roman capital letterforms.</i>&#34;
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s no small thing.

  body: I know there is a library, in Arezzo &#40;Tuscany&#41;, with plenty of books
    from the Petrarch time, those could be interesting. <BR>And Tuscany in this period
    of the year is absolutely gorgeous.  <BR> <BR>Besides where I live there&#39;s
    Saluzzo, the town where G.B. Bodoni was born. But I don&#39;t know whether there
    is something valuable there.

  body: you have to check out the recycled slabs of stone used for the cathedral in
    Pisa! <BR>also the San Clemente church in Rome, but you&#39;ve probably heard
    all about that already. No guidebook is without it&#39;s mention, there&#39;s
    an interesting &#39;headstone&#39; there.

  body: You will love Rome - there&#39;s so much public lettering around - on bridges,
    triumphal arches, it&#39;s everywhere &#40;Trajan&#39;s column is fantastic&#41;
    - I did the typo course at Reading and we had a trip to Rome - somewhere I have
    an itinerary which is a walking tour of Rome for Typographers - if I can find
    it I&#39;ll forward to you if you like.  Also the Vatican library is worth seeing.
    Have fun -  x
