  body: "When you say 'old' when are you talking about? If this is before the mid-1980's
    it would probably be film type (photo-lettering) and might not have been digitized
    as a font that is available today.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well, the original publishing of that particular game was in 1982 but that
    font was continually used more or less up until somewhere around -91 or -94.\r\n\r\n/Jonatan"

  body: "If you mean that they continued using the same lettering for the game then
    it could still have used the original lettering, if it was photo-lettering. That
    might be the answer for not recognizing this -- if it's pre-digital.\r\n\r\n-

  body: It's an old Letraset face from the seventies called Melissa Inline. I think
    it must have been dropped before they started digitizing Letraset faces. It doesn't
    seem to be available in digital format.
