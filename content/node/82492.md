    very conventional, but I'm having no luck.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have an idea?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Just to prove I have been trying, this is similar to Jeremy Tankard's \"Bliss\",
    but the shape of the C is wrong and the heaviest Bliss weight isn't quite this
    heavy. Also found a font at MyFonts called \"Haptic\" which had sort of the right
    shapes, but has rounded strokes. Prelo, also at MyFonts, was similar, but had
    a straight 'l'.\r\n\r\nThe curved l and two-story g is a rare combination, and
    add the straight stem 'a', and I can find almost nothing similar. This suggests
    either a font not carried at MyFonts, or a font with an alternate letter that
    is not showing up in the test drives.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    that's not the case.

    Unfortunately the font is not available temporarily.
