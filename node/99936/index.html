		<div class="commentbody"><p>He wasn’t a type designer.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schroeder_6227.png]</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is part of a text I’ve been working on, which describes the ﬁrst De Vinne typeface (shown above):</p>
<p>Elzevir, originally designed in the late 18th century, was revived in France in the 1880s and enjoyed a return to popularity in the USA, inspiring Gustav Schroeder&rsquo;s “De Vinne” of 1893 (Elzevir Bold, really), which became the most popular typeface of the 1890s. It was named after Theodore De Vinne, the leading figure in American typography. He was a printer in the wide sense of the term as it was then employed, a publisher of books and magazines, instigator of coated paper, co-founder of the Grolier Club for bibliophiles, and an authority on typography who wrote extensively on the subject. Of the eponymous face, De Vinne said, “This face is the outcome of correspondence (1888-90) between the senior of the De Vinne Press [meaning himself] and Mr. J. A. St. John of the Central Type Foundry of St. Louis, concerning the need of plainer types of display, to replace the profusely ornamented types in fashion, of which the printers of that time had a surfeit. The DeVinne Press suggested a return to the simplicity of the true old-style character, but with the added features of thicker lines and adjusted proportion in shapes of letters. Mr. St. John approved, but insisted on grotesques to some capital letters in the belief that they would meet a general desire for more quaintness. Mr. Werner of the Central Type Foundry was instructed to draw and cut the proposed face in all sizes from 6- to 72-point, which task he executed with great ability. The name given to this face by Mr. St. John is purely complimentary, for no member of the De Vinne Press has any claim on the style as inventor or designer. Its merits are largely due to Mr. Werner; its few faults of uncouth capitals show a desire to please eccentric tastes and to conform to old usage. The new face found welcome here and abroad; no advertising face of recent production had a greater sale.”
The De Vinne typeface was a successful compromise between two established forces competing for the soul of the popular magazine. 
The foundry man claimed it for commercial interest, as a business venture captivating the consumer with visual spectacle, in the manner of brash job-printed flyers and bills larded with exotically dimensionalized fonts, or lithographed posters with even more ornately flourished lettering. St. John recognized the need for something new and eye-catching, and Schroeder&rsquo;s (not Werner, as De Vinne had mistakenly believed) adaptation provided that, with the quiet personality which the features of Elzevier possessed as a light text type becoming quite loud in the guise of a bold display face, the upper case features going so far as to impress DeVinne as &ldquo;grotesques&rdquo;. It was a marriage of Parisian cachet with Yankee brashness. Such commercial interest found its foothold in the advertising of mass magazines, which during the 1890s became an experimental laboratory for marketing communication.
De Vinne claimed the magazine for typography and idealism, the editorial well his stronghold, calling for fonts of dignity and simplicity used in the understated manner of quality book and traditional magazine printing; but while he railed against the usual late Victorian suspect of profuse ornament, he too needed something new, for there were plenty of beautiful, simple, functional Victorian faces he could have turned to, but they had been around awhile, and their virtues had palled.
Although Mr De Vinne was not entirely satisfied, he couldn&rsquo;t argue with the instant and immediate success of his eponymous face. A year later (1894) he began working more closely with a typefounder, Linn Boyd Benton, on a commission for the Century magazine, of which he was publisher. The strict demeanour of the resulting Century Roman was more to his taste, and the heft of its hairlines more to his ease (he was 66 at the time); the face would not become popular, although its descendants would. The Century family branched out with Century Expanded (1900), Century Oldstyle (1906), and Century Schoolbook (1918). 
In Devinne and Century, there is a gradual movement away from the refined detail of the Scotch Modern, which had been the favored style of everyday text type in the US for 60 years, and the more recent but similar in effect Old Style, towards a heavier impression, matching the tenor of the times which found its most forceful expression in William Morris. Like De Vinne, Morris was in his sixties in the nineties, so their beef with fine type may well have been age-related.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nice commentary, Nick. Looking forward to your book!</p>
<p>DeVinne was a great and unique character in the history of printing and type, being both the leading American printer and scholar of printing and type history in his day.  His [[http://archive.org/details/historicprinting00devirich|Historic Printing Types]] is a great book and thankfully it&rsquo;s on line—the link goes to it. He has an superb eye, and his critiques are extremely insightful and not dated at all, which is pretty astonishing.</p>
<p>I consulted it in doing my article about the 19th century revival of Old Style types, and Caslon in particular, for July 2011 edition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Printing History<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There is also a first rate series of historical articles by Ovink, called &lsquo;19th Century Reactions against the Didone Type Model&rsquo; which includes the history of the French old styles. I consulted these also, thanks to the tip by William Peterson, then editor of Printing History. Nick, you might want to consult those, if you don&rsquo;t know them already.</p>
<p>I think the &lsquo;grotesque&rsquo; display &lsquo;DeVinne&rsquo; is not worthy of his name, though he may not have had a problem with it. His legacy in type design is really the Century series, which bears the stamp of his ideas, even though the Bentons drew it. There is also a Linotype DeVinne in metal, which is a Scotch style, without the thickened thin strokes of Century. It was very widely used, especially in scientific texts, I believe, though I may have it wrong; Bitstream did a revival of it, as Nick notes. DeVinne himself constantly used a lot of Scotch style types as a printer, as Nick&rsquo;s illustration shows, even though his Century was intended to improve on the style.</p>

<pre><code>No digital version exists, other than a rough &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/?refby=typographica&quot;&gt;wood facsimile&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still possible to get the metal type: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arionpress.com/mandh/letterpress-type-fonts.html#D&quot;&gt;M &amp;amp; H&lt;/a&gt; casts the Monotype version, which was called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/stream/monotypespecimen00lansrich#page/n295/mode/2up&quot;&gt;No. 11&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/53177163@N00/4781254606/in/set-72157624341161439&quot;&gt;Devinne&lt;/a&gt;”.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DeVinne Ornamental<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Stephenson Blake, (Deberny &amp; Peignot Les Modernes, c.1900)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
DeVinne Ornamental was released by Stephenson Blake around 1900, based on a Deberny &amp; Peignot typeface called Les Modernes. [Reichardt]</p>
<p>Various sources list Gustav F. Schroeder as the designer, but it is unclear that he had anything to do with this typeface, and these credits may be misapplied from his design for Central.</p>
<p>There are at least three digital versions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linotype’s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and two from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->URW<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which are distinct and may be based on different metal sizes or different sources altogether. Naming also varies, adding to the confusion. This design is known at various outlets as “Devinne”, “De Vinne”, or “DeVinne”. “Ornament”, “Ornamented”, and “Ornamental” are also used.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->De Vinne<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Linotype/Bitstream, (Bruce No. 11, 1890)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
MyFonts describes this De Vinne as a revival of Bruce’s No. 11. It was released by Linotype in 1902. It appears Linotype soon replaced the face with their “Modern” series, because De Vinne does not appear in catalogs after 1920. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bitstream<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’s revival is the only digital version called “De Vinne”.</p>
<p>Despite its name, this typeface doesn’t seem to have anything specific to do with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theodore Low De Vinne<!-- raw HTML omitted --> except that No. 11 appears in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Text Types of the De Vinne Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a collection of specimens from various sources.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is also a Linotype DeVinne in metal, which is a Scotch style, without the thickened thin strokes of Century. It was very widely used, especially in scientific texts, I believe, though I may have it wrong; Bitstream did a revival of it, as Nick notes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In general, because of the demand for mathematical formulas in scientific texts, Monotype, rather than Linotype, was used for them. It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> true that Scotch Roman faces were very widely used in scientific texts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">An interesting interlude: De Vinne 36pt was used directly as the pin mark for the famous Japanese type foundry, Tsukiji, which was founded by Tomiji Hirano. (Hirano is the surname and Tomiji is the first name) The foundry&rsquo;s pin mark is a De Vinne H in a circle.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see that DeVinne Ornamental, although it resembles a typeface I&rsquo;ve spoken of before that came from ATF, Columbus, is definitely not the same typeface.</p>
<p>In looking at old ATF catalogs, I ran across Samoa, which slightly resembled a typeface I ran across looking for Artistik look-alikes - but upon checking, I see that they&rsquo;re not really that similar. Unlike Artistik, neither of them differentiates mirror letters well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I see that Columbus was digitally revived by Sam Wang before a Kickstarter project to revive it - he also revived a few other noted old typefaces, such as Greeting Monotone (which I knew as Margery).</p>
