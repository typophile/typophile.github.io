  Foundation as it seems that the person who did the original work is not around.
  I was given some rough raster drawings, which I decided to convert to vector, so
  that I have something to work with.\r\n\r\nI copied the graphics fine, but am having
  trouble identifying the fonts and wonder if somebody could help me?\r\n\r\nThe first
  one is the main logo, found on the website on the top left hand corner of the page:\r\nhttp://peterhughesburnfoundation.org.au\r\n\r\nThe
  second is on this graphic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/survivor_3631.jpg]\r\n\r\nMuch
  gratitude and good wishes to all,\r\nRoger Barnes"
