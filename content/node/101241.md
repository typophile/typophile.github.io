body: I am working on a historical novel set in 18th century Birmingham, England,
  about, among other things, John Baskerville. I am looking for an illustration (or
  other image...photos of replicas?) or a good (i.e. detailed) written description
  of a type-casting mould of the kind in use at this time. Can you help? Print and
  typographical history are just part of the ongoing research for this project, so
  any other recommended resources on the subject--great books, websites, etc.--would
  be much appreciated. So much to learn....

    that Guy Hutsebaut (the man in the Plantin-Moretus video, whom I had the pleasure
    of meeting at the second Thessaloniki conference) isn't flicking the mould up
    as he pours the type-metal, which is supposed to reduce air bubbles in the sort
    (by making the metal settle faster). Maybe that's actually a bit of romanticism,
    or maybe you only do that if you're making thousands of sorts a day...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in many related type-founding techniques (like he helped me cut a punch* even
    though he almost never did that himself) I was thinking he might have shown some
    oldschool mould action as well. Hmmm, great excuse to watch the DVD again...\r\n\r\n*

  body: Thank you so much! This really helps. I had imagined the mould as metal with
    wood on the outside (something I read somewhere along the line suggested this
    to me...the wood being for insulation?) but these sources seems to suggest it
    was only metal. Deeply appreciate the help. S

  body: 'In the images posted by bbg there doesn''t appear to be any metal on the
    mould; I took the darker parts with strike marks for metal--wrongly? And I thought
    your FIG 215 was all metal but I guess the lines are meant to suggest wood grain?
    The others have wood but appear newer. '

  body: "Coming at this very late in the game, but if SDMAC wishes information about
    type moulds please feel free to contact me at raymond.nelson.jr@gmail.com as I
    have quite a bit of relevant information.\r\nThe photographs above are of Giet
    Instrument 48, from the collection of the Museum Plantin-Moretus.  It is probably
    the oldest surviving typemould, based upon its structure and a tentative association
    with matrices dating from the late 15th century.  \r\nGuy Hutsebaut is experienced
    in hand casting, and knows that one does not need to shake the mould with every
    sort, but the shake is essential in many cases if one is to achieve a sharp face
    on the type being cast.  It isn't to remove air bubbles, but rather to drive the
    liquid metal into the 'eye' of the matrix before it solidifies, since the metal
    freezes in an instant."

    used for trickier sorts? For example not the \"o\", but the \"\xE6\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
