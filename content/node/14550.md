  body: In the Art Institute of Chicago, they have rebuilt the interior of the main
    room from the demolished Chicago Stock Exchange building, which was designed by
    Louis Sullivan. If you go in the back entrance, you can go inside this room for
    free (the hallway to it is before you get to the check-in desks). Or, at least
    is was that way in 2000. But anyway, taht interior is worth it!

  body: "although i havent been yet (finding time is tough) i heard the newberry library
    on oak and clark is wonderful. it's mentioned at least 3 times in Anatomy of a
    Typeface by A. Lawson...i believe they have some original drawings of Centaur
    there as well as tons of illuminated manuscripts and all sorts of other goodies.
    \r\n\r\nthe tech guy at my work told me you just have to have a purpose of research
    (private library), give them $5 and you get a card to come back whenever. i think
    this is how it works. sorry for the fuzziness, but i have been told definitely
    go there.\r\n\r\nalso, try some pubs in the wicker park area. type and letters
    never look sweeter until you've had a few. double door is always fun. or if youre
    a beer in cans kinda person, try to find the Hideout. good luck though. when you
    see the desolate street hidden by factories on either side with a crudely spray
    painted sign hidden by a bushy tree pointing left to hideout, youre on the right
    track.\r\n\r\nwill"

  body: "The Newberry is a must. If you're not from Illinois, you can get a one day
    Readers' Room pass. Illinois residents can get a one year pass. It's entirely
    free. Be aware that 75% of their collection is still referenced by a card catalog
    (not online), which is brilliant. Most books of typographic interest will have
    a call number beginning with 'Wing' and will be on the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nAs
    Will said, they have an amazing collection. They do in fact have original drawings
    of the Centaur types, as well as a large collection of other Bruce Rogers stuff.
    Other things off the top of my head in their collection : 3 Nuremberg Chronicles
    (2 German in rough shape, 1 Latin with great rubrication); Ratdolt's Euclid and
    some Calendariums but without the great tip-ins; Plantin's Polyglot Bible; Manutius'
    Poliphili, De Aetna, and a ton of octavos; a nice selection of Adolf Rusch; the
    Champ Fleury; and on and on.\r\n\r\nThe U-Boat at the Museum of Science and Industry
    is definitely worth checking out (get there early if you want to take a tour of
    the inside). There's also an exhibit of plasticized human cadavers that I hear
    will blow your mind.\r\n\r\nSox games sell out these days, but they're great if
    you can get tickets. Go to Puffers for beers after the game.\r\n\r\n1104 S Wabash,
    2nd Floor is Columbia College's Center for Book and Paper Arts. They have cool
    exhibitions once in a while. \r\n\r\nI'll try to post more stuff later."

    job and am moving to Chicago in two weeks. \r\n\r\nThe art museum is free on tuesdays.
    They have a big Toulouse-Lautrec special exhibition right now but it costs more.
    The best type related stuff I could find during my visit was a copy of the new
    U&LC book in the gift shop. \r\n\r\nIf you make it to a Sox game, sit in right
    field by Carl Everett and bring a giant picture of a dinosaur. That would make
    my day. Go Tigers. "

    Co-op Bookstore (new books, not used or rare), and Ohara's (one of the only rare-ish
    type bookstores about). If you head down that way -- perhaps after a visit to
    the U-boat -- eat at Salonica (caddy corner to Powell's). Frank Lloyd Wright's
    Robie House is also nearby -- currently being overshadowed by the loads of crap
    new construction going on at Univ. of Chicago -- and the place for libations is
    Jimmy's Woodlawn Tap on 55th.\r\n\r\nThere's also a used/rare book/map store somewhere
    around Oak street (not Hyde Park, but north of the Loop). That's so ambiguous
    it's useless, but I'll try to dig up an address. Haven't been there in years.\r\n\r\n[I

    enter the actual library with a camera, and if you pull out an ink pen in the
    Readers' Room, a librarian will do a flying roundhouse kick to your throat). But
    they do have a reproduction services department. Images are avilable in JPEG and
    TIFF formats (with TIFFs being substantially more expensive). IIRC, there's a
    $10 set-up fee per book, and JPEGs are about $5 a shot. I forget the cost of TIFFs.
    \r\n\r\nSo if you have a particular book/era/typographer you're interested in,
    you might want to consider that as an option while you're there. They can either
    email the files or ship you a CD."

    also passes through an elliptical corrugated metal tube perched above the building.
    It's southern neighbor is a new student housing development by Helmut Jahn. I
    think there've been some other new building projects going on at IIT recently.\r\n\r\nIf

    I've never eaten there (I have absolutely no sweet tooth), but it comes highly
    recommended by my father and several friends. It's worth it for the interior alone.\r\n\r\nVegetarian
    friendly resaurants:\r\n\r\nLula's in Logan Square is a favorite of many. (But
    if you're in Logan & not vegetarian, have the corned beef hash at Johnny's. Superb.)\r\nThe
    Chicago Diner (despite the connotations of its name) is entirely meat-free and
    quite good. North Halsted above Addison.\r\nEarwax in Wicker Park is mostly vegetarian,
    IIRC.\r\nThere are also a few vegetarian soul food restaurants in the southside,
    if you're into biscuits and collard green like me. Soul Vegetarian East is on
    75th Street -- I ate there in school, and haven't been back since, but it's phenomenal.
    And there's Vegetarian Express on 111th. Never been there, but I believe there's
    a connection between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    & cheap Wicker. Decent video rentals upstairs too. Although the idea of organizing
    by director is overly art-school-cool.\r\n\r\nMyopic, just south on Milwaukee,
    has a good selection of used books. Nothing rare though, and their fiction and
    art selection is vastly superior to their type & design."

    in chili pepper. And elotes: corn (on the cob or in a cup) smothered with mayo,
    butter, parmesan cheese, and red pepper. Two in the same day will cause a massive
    coronary. But once in a while won''t kill you. I hope.'
