body: 'Hello all, I was just curious what some of your favourite typography and design&#40;layout,
  colour, etc&#41; books are or titles that you would consider being essential. <BR>
  <BR>I am in the process of starting a little library of my own and I am always looking
  to check out new titles. <BR> <BR>So far: <BR> <BR>Grid Systems in Graphic Design
  by Muller-Brockmann <BR>Typographie by Emil Ruder <BR>Typography - Macro&#43;Microaesthetics
  by Willi Kunz <BR>My Way to Typography by Wolfgang Weingart <BR> <BR>A friend also
  lent me Itten&#39;s Elements of Color which I am just starting to read. <BR> <BR>I
  am thinking about picking up Armin Hoffmans &#34;Graphic Design Manual&#34; and
  Wili Kunz&#39;s new type book. <BR>'

  body: I would be interested yeah providing that they are in good condition which
    I am sure they are, which ones do you have? <BR> <BR>Yeah I really enjoyed the
    Willi Kunz book, I for sure going to pick up his new one, and I keep hearing really
    good things about the Bringhurst book so I think I am going to pick up that one
    too.
