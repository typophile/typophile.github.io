  are in Myriad Pro Bold condensed (which I love)\r\nRight now our body copy is in
  Minion Pro 10 pt, which I kind of like, but I'm ambivalent towards it. I don't feel
  like it's the BEST choice.\r\nWhat's a great font for body copy in a newspaper?"

  body: "Not sure exactly what it is, but it's pretty standard (probably cheap) gray
    newsprint. Anything grayscale will usually print pretty clearly.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    And for the record, it's a high school newspaper at a magnet high school for students
    interested in medical professions (in case that matters)"

    although to be honest I have never tried using it in a newspaper layout. It has
    a nice clean \"antiseptic\" quality to it.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.linotype.com/885/joanna-family.html|Joanna]]
    is nice too, but I don't know if you can tolerate the really awkward numbers.
    Also it might be a bit light.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
