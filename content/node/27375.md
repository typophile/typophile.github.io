  catalogue featuring contemporary Iraqi book art. There will be several essays\u2014maybe
  76 pages or so of largely unillustrated text. Some footnotes, probably to be set
  as endnotes.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that most faces appropriate for setting medium
  length texts carry a western baggage that doesn't add much to the idea of the book.
  I've found a few solutions on my own, but I don't want to color the discussion yet.\r\n\r\nThere
  are 17 featured artists. Here is a sample cover image of one of the books by Mohammed
  al-Shammerey.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15C_6345.jpg]"

  body: That is a beautiful image, but I am stumped. Are you looking for something
    with an Eastern feel, or something generally international looking with no deep
    roots in the past?

  body: "Not so much an Eastern feel. I don't think mimicry of Arab script is right
    on this.\r\n\r\nI think the international feel is the direction I'm looking. I
    don't want the type bound to a particular period in Western typographic history
    that has zero resonance with the subject. That rules out most of the pure classics.
    Some of the very neutral sans faces could work in that they might avoid offending,
    but they may not be right for the length of the combined texts. The texts (at
    least the early versions) are fairly politically charged. That makes any playful
    lightness in a face look comical.\r\n\r\nI've almost been seduced a few times
    so far, and have almost settled in. I was looking for someone to shake me up one
    more time. Thanks for reviving the thread BTW."

  body: "I didn't mean a mimicry of Arabic calligraphy, that would be totally ridiculous
    :)\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that maybe there exists a roman designed for Turkish
    which is not based on Western historical forms. Or you could take the no-holds-barred
    approach of using something postmodern / unusual. Then there's the 'when in doubt,
    use something Swiss' approach which usually works for just about anything, though
    robs it of personality. A neutral position using a neutral typeface from a neutral
    country. So your choices in this instance would be a typeface from :\r\n\r\nSwitzerland\r\nSweden\r\nFinland\r\nAustria\r\nMexico\r\nIreland\r\n\r\nI
    don't know whether Liechtenstein, Costa Rica and Turkmenistan have the graphic
    design scene (or population) necessary to produce fonts for international sale.
    But the countries listed above do, the first three definitely have active type
    foundries (Optimo, MAC Rhino, Suomi, Psy-Ops, Fountain...) \r\n\r\nPerhaps this
    is a direction you could try to keep things objective. And good old Helvetica
    fits this criterion. The Swedish type foundries in particular are prolific."
