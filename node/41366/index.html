<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Reading about Bembo just now I came across a reference to the long R & short R in Metal Bembo from Monotype. Which got me wondering what other alternative glyphs or alternative glyph combinations there might have been.
I know that Linotype had quite a few "logotypes" which were a mix of Kering solutions and ligatures (mainly f related but sometimes including much more ) and sometimes there were even contextual alteration of non ligature kerned logotypes. I found the contextual stuff at the Printing History Museum in North Andover. Here is some more info on that:
http://www.typophile.com/node/36157
My questions are, if I wanted to see if similar things had been done with Monotype Metal fonts where would I look? Did Monotype use the Term "logotype"? What alternative characters do you know and or love?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>If this were a research project (ie you weren't planning on making a Bembo knock-off, but were, say, writing a dissertation on Bembo) you'd get in contact with Robin Nicholas, and request an appointment to visit the Monotype UK office in Salfords. Robin, might then let you examine the original engineering drawings which would include the special sorts. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, this is a sort of dissertation albeit not affiliated or otherwise sanctioned by an institution*.
I will contact Robin. I don't think I will be able to visit between now & Typecon but maybe later. And maybe he has some ideas about this. Do you have his contact info? Would you send it to me by email?
Nice new avatar BTW! I really like the old one too.
*This question is related to a talk I am probably going to give at Typecon about Text faces use of contextual shapes. From hand scripts to metal to digital and a shift in thinking I want to encourage. The Linotype examples are pretty great I think just because they show high craft within a very constrained situation and they support the idea that context specific shapes can be just as useful in text as they are in display. I feel like I have done a reasonable job with the metal Linotype but I haven't even looked at metal Monotype!

<div class=commentbody>There's no need to go all the way back to the engineering drawings to see what special characters were available. If you can track down any copies of the specimen sheets or books that Monotype prepared for their customers, they'll usually show the special characters along with the part numbers that were used to order the correct matrices for any given typeface. For instance, here's a note from a specimen for Bembo Bold 428 (unfortunately I don't have the corresponding sheet for Series 270, the regular weight):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bembo_bold_alts_8pt_3673.gif]
You can see the alternate versions of R available, as well as a few additional ligatures. Granted, the drawings would make it easier to see what's been adjusted to make those ligatures, but the printed specimens I've seen have always had really clear printing.
(That's 8 pt. type shown at 300%, in case you're wondering.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Cool! It's interesting to see that they call the special letter combinations ligatures even if the don't visually touch. Are there special years that are better or worse to track down like there are for the ATF catalog?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The later the better for any given form of the typeface (that is, the latest specimen of either the metal or the film version you can find), since any specials that were custom ordered by any customers would be added to the next round of updates. I'm not sure when the major sets of specimens were released, but I've mostly seen binders of specimens that allowed customers to insert the updated sheets as they were produced.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> <em>That’s how Linotype did it too I think.</em>
I can't resist quoting the comment by Beatrice Warde aka Paul Beaujon on the extra characters made by Linotype for Granjon in her piece on the ‘Garamond’ types in <em>Fleuron</em> 5:
‘To offset the unfortunate inability of the Linotype to cast a kerned f, no fewer than twenty-six ligatures are provided. After such a sacrifice of practicality to beauty, it would be ungenerous of an author to mention Afghanistan, and so call out the ‘button-hook’ f that is the family spectre of Linotype designers.’</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben --
Have I mentioned the Spiral/Emerson contextual r to you before? It was part of Blumenthal's original foundry type, but didn't make it into the Monotype cutting of the face -- probably because they couldn't really accommodate it in the matrix case and there wasn't likely to be much interest in such a specialized sort as an extra.
If you can get your hands on a copy of the APHA's <cite>American Proprietary Typefaces,</cite> Jerry Kelly discusses this on page 115 in his article on Emerson.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for that last post Kent. It spawned a new thread later that was pretty great.
Thanks James!
I noticed recently that I have on example of what I was looking for in "Finer Points in the Spacing & Arrangement of Type" by Geoffrey Dowding. On page 72 is an image of ligatures and swashes for "Monotype Garamond 156". It's not bad - but I am not sure I see any special shapes that are not decorative - except for the ears on the double g. One is longer than the other - unless the repro isn't as hgood as I would like...
An interesting side note: He mentions that there was a ligature ( not completely in the sense we mean today) of the Word "The". There is no image of it however.
Any suggestions for search strategies on Monotype Specimens in Libraries? So far I am not having luck. Maybe because they were in binders rather than being in bound books, they didn't make it into libraries. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Another angle might be to identify some popular composing houses that used Monotype and look for their specimens. Major composing houses would periodically produce publications outlining the faces that they had on hand, often with extensive showings. Kingsport Press is one that comes to mind -- a three volume set: one for Linotype, one for Monotype, and one for Display faces.
I've seen a few sets before, but I don't recall if they give full character showings in addition to the copious settings.

<div class=commentbody>I seem to remember another alternate sort available in metal Monotype 270.
I think there was an alternate capital roman M. I cannot remember what it looked like, and every time I looked at that specimen sheet I could not figure out what its purpose was.
Maybe James Mosley or someone else with ready access to those Monotype specimen sheets can look at one and tell us.
Lord, I sure hope I'm not imagining that. I may have to tear the house apart this weekend and find those books.

<div class=commentbody>I am guessing it was a swash but I would definitely like to know. Our only composing house closed about a year ago. Obviously I should have swooped in... I will a librarian here if they have anything like this.
James I really enjoyed your "spectre" reference. I should have mentioned this earlier.</div>
