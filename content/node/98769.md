body: "(Following up from <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/98710\">this thread
  in Design</a>.)\r\n\r\nHaving read that it's a useful learning exercise for a starting
  designer to try digitizing a historical (metal) type, I decided to try this with
  Bruce Rogers's Centaur.  I've never seen a digital version that looks remotely close
  to the beautiful text of books typeset in metal Centaur \u2013 they're all come
  out too fine and spindly, and look oddly sterile somehow.  I'm clearly <a href=\"http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=12\">not
  the only one to think so</a>.\r\n\r\nI recently acquired a copy of \"The Centaur
  Types\", which is set in 16-point metal-type Centaur.  Using that as a guide, I
  began trying to something that captures the spirit of the text within its pages.
  \ (I actually adapted my initial outlines from scans out of Meggs & Carter's \u201CTypographic
  Specimens: The Great Typefaces\u201D, supplemented by some unfortunately rather
  poor-quality images from an old 20th-century Monotype catalogue that I found on-line.
  \ I then used the Rogers text as a guide for redrawing the outlines to the desired
  weight.)\r\n\r\nI had to essentially invent a number of characters since the metal
  type (so far as I know) never included them.  I tried to be consistent with the
  style of metal Centaur, and that of other humanist types of similar origin.\r\n\r\nFor
  the time being, I've given my new Centaur revival the working name \"Mythology\".
  \ Compared to other digital Centaurs, Mythology is both more substantial and less
  mechanically crisp in form.  It also has looser spacing.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/mythology/Mythology.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first attempt at a direct revival.  I'd be interested to know what others
  think, not just of the results but of the methods used to reach this point.  As
  well as more general critique, of course.  :)"

    If you can't find a source to confirm what Monotype et al have done and want to
    make yours different, an asterisk of appropriate character might be made by pinwheeling
    the comma or a shape like the top of the exclamation point.

    a solid black star be better?  I've seen some 15th-century revivals do that (Bembo
    comes to mind).\r\n"

  body: "BTW, in point of fact the 'shuriken' asterisk in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/93634#comment-529784\">this
    post</a> was originally designed for Mythology.  I ended up deciding it worked
    better in Suzuran, though \u2014 and so I changed Mythology to use the star, which
    I thought looked rather interesting.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I'm wondering
    if it'd be worth trying to do a 'handtooled' version of this font...\r\n"

  body: "No knowledge, but you might be interested in [[http://benwhitmore.altervista.org/coelacanth-type-family/|this]],
    an open source digitisation with optical sizes, in alpha. Be warned: it's rough,
    especially the italic!\r\n\r\nIf you're planning to use it you'll want to disable
    the ligatures in italic, since the ligatures in place there are roman ones, and
    personally I think the heavy weight feels more for interpolation than as designs
    I'd consider using. But the basics are there, and having optical styles makes
    this an interesting project. I don't believe any digitisation of it has optical
    sizes, open source or not. [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/centaur/|Here]]
    and [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/|here]] are less idealistic
    but more practical releases."
