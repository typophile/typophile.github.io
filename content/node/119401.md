  body: "I can't find something similar (and I suppose nobody else of the usual identifiers
    of the forum either...)\r\nThis is probably customized and there is a chance that
    the capitals belong to a different font than the lowercase letters.\r\nDo you
    have a better photo? (maybe closer and -more important- not shaken?)\r\nIf you
    have the cup, 2 photos will be even better:  One by centering \"Shadow\" and another
    centering the \"F\" of \"Farm\".\r\n(Tip: If you are using a phone to take the
    photos, turn on all lights and attach the phone to the top of 1-2 books to keep
    it stable and avoid shake)"
