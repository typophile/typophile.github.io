  handbag\" illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe font, I believe, is most similar to is Brandon
  Grotesque, but this is a little more ornate.\r\n\r\nAny help from anyone more knowledgeable
  on the matter would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hermes_birkin-640x938_6321.jpg]"
