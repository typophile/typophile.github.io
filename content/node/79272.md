  body: I wanna know, too!  It looks like a few typefaces I love, but I can't seem
    to put my finger on it.  Maybe something by ParaType or Village?

  body: I looked through everything at Village shortly after that. Its driving me

  body: What about the subtitle "Hardcore will never die, but you will." That's not
