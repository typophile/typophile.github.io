  body: "The company is being developed now, waiting for the permits etc, and I\xB4ll
    be involved in the copy side of the onboard magazine. The ships might be sailing
    some time next year, but in the first quarter of 2011 the editorial team for the
    onboard magazine needs to be ready preparing the launching issue. As I said, my
    area is coordinating writers and translators. I love design, and have been register
    on this forum for a long time, but only to educate my eyes... I\xB4m a translator
    and a storyteller. I\xB4m sure the designer (whom I asked to join this forum)
    will have his own ideas etc but what I\xB4ve notice in this \"tribe\" (using Seth
    Godin\xB4s concept) is the good level of collaboration and support. \r\nI\xB4m
    sure not being clear got the deserved \"Comic Sans\" suggestion  upthread. "

  body: "adiazpaz, the problem was that your original question was way too broad.
    As far as I know there isn't some group of fonts that is specifically appropriate
    for ferries.\r\n\r\nYou said it's a new company under development. Your company
    will need to develop a complete visual identity system, including a logo, fonts,
    color palette, stationery, formats for ads, signage, etc., and hopefully all these
    elements will work harmoniously together, and will be applied consistently to
    your ships as well as your printed materials, website, and advertising. \r\n\r\nYes,
    this is a lot of work! It will require you to carefully consider what image you
    want to project, how you're going to differentiate yourself from your competition,
    and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd going back to your original question, in order to recommend
    fonts, folks here would need to know a lot more specifically about the image that
    you're trying to project.\r\n\r\nA good starting point might be for you to collect
    images and printed samples from other ship companies to find examples both good
    and bad to study, and to see what your competition is doing. My guess is that
    some of the best examples would come from large cruise lines that have big budgets,
    and while your budget might not be in the same league you might get some good
    ideas from their examples."

  body: "Thanks. I\xB4m a close friend of the CEO,  and as far as I know the company
    is finishing their negotiation on permits from both Cuban and American governments.
    I dont think they are yet at  a stage where they have a clear corporate image,
    colourscheme, etc. (and their current logo is really bad! as it\xB4s the few documents
    they have prepared for investors andthe officials in charge of granting permissions...
    \xB4The coreteam at the moment are businessmen, not creatives. Ill soon\xB4be
    meeting  the marketing director, who is going to be my inmediate boss. I was told
    about him being asked to join the project a couple of days ago.  I insisted to
    my friendthe importance on having a good marketing director, and I offered myself
    to  be one of the two editors of their onboard magazine. The other editor and
    the graphic designer are close friends of mine, and though the designer is very
    experienced I asked here looking for some sort of recommendations on fonts to
    use (or avoid)  to pass on the info to my friend. As I said upthread I\xB4ll be
    more involved in the selection of copy and translation (it\xB4s going to be a
    bilingual magazine). \r\n"

  body: "> I dont think they are yet at a stage where \r\n> they have a clear corporate
    image\r\n\r\nIf management hasn't given that much thought, it may fall to the
    marketing director and his team to define it, based on their understanding of
    management's goals. But it needs to be careful thought out, and it's essential
    that the CEO agrees with the direction the creative team is taking. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, you wouldn't want a marketing team to create a visual identity that's
    young and hip, and then find out the CEO wants a more traditional image that appeals
    to an older crowd. Or create an onboard magazine aimed mostly at tourists, and
    then find out that your CEO is aiming mostly for business travelers. Etc. "

  body: "Well, at this first stage (untill a change of the US law and all Americans
    -other than those of Cuban origins- can visit Cuba) most passangers are going
    to be Cuban-Americans, with the exception offew who can travel to Cuba with an
    OAFC permit. Of course the aim is that once the ban is lifted (which seems likely,
    sometime next year) many US tourist might be going to Cuba and together with theexisting
    regularflights they\xB4ll have theseferries from Port Evergaldes andKey West to
    Havana. So I guess is mostly family visits, on the first wave, and general  tourists
    later on.  The CEO is my friend and he listens to everything I say. I sort of
    advice him or other issues... \r\n\r\nAs I said I haven\xB4t yet met the new marketing
    director and I don\xB4t know which strategies he thinks to implement, but the
    CEO wants a \"modern\", \"21stCentury\"  look  -whatever that means.\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment I\xB4m working on likely themes for the mothly magazine (around seasonal
    events, Havana\xB4s cultural calendar etc), creating a pool of writers etc. My
    question was just to get ideas on fonts to pass it on the likely designer for
    the magazine -whom I chose because of friendship and think that\xB4d make a better
    way of working. The CEO wants me to edit the magazine (the idea of having an onboard
    magazine was mine)  and asked me to form my own team.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
