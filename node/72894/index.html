<p>Hmmm&hellip; maybe if you want to snap the text box to the same guideline that&rsquo;s used by a different printing object (like a rule or photo box). If there&rsquo;s no text inset, the type will butt that object. Having a text inset allows you to align both objects to the same guideline and still maintain some white space between the printing elements. If you have to do that many times in a layout, might save a little time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is not over controlled at all, it is absolutely proper for somebody to be able position text how they so wish, that is the nature of a layout program. I agree that when this level of precision is available and so readily available at that, it is lazy not to use it. This is Typophile - sorry to refute Mr Sipe so thoroughly but Typophile is largely concerned with taking a great deal of care with all these things, from layout, to even finer work like kerning. Worry no, care absolutely. Apologies in advance, I just find it frustrating that this attitude is prevalent in design in general. To encounter it here I find baffling.</p>
<p>Aligning to the top of the frame is easy as explained before in First Baseline menu to  Cap-Height.
However regarding align left, there is a good reason not to, as Frode rightly pointed out, to accommodate the side bearings of the font. Whereas a line beginning with A will sit left of the frame, one beginning with j will generally peak out of the frame, creating an optical alignment from top to bottom.</p>
<p>You can check Optical Margin Alignment (Window&gt;Type &amp; Tables&gt;Story) but I don&rsquo;t fully understand this function. Perhaps someone could explain?</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m misunderstanding, but are you saying that using a text inset of &ldquo;0&rdquo; on the left edge will result in inferior alignment of text which is left-aligned? I did a quick test using both 0 inset on left edge and 1 pica inset on left edge, and it didn&rsquo;t appear to affect the quality of the alignment.</p>

<p>I agree with Steve, re his image, yes it does need to be aligned correctly to the graphic frame and yes I would loose sleep over it. If you were a junior in my company I would also bollock you for not aligning it correctly as well, it&rsquo;s not OCD it&rsquo;s just plain lazy.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me check again James as I&rsquo;m confused by what you mean. Surely inset of zero is default and preferred for text? Sorry if I am misunderstanding your point. The initial problem in the thread that remains unsolved is to get the text to butt the frame to the left, but this is character and line specific, by default some letters won&rsquo;t butt it at all, some will and others will overshoot it to the left.</p>
<p>The default left edge of a text block consisting of several lines at text size, placed in a grid beneath an image, ought to look correct as the number of characters overshooting will make up for those undershooting, so to speak, an average optical line will appear.</p>
<p>I can see your problem at display sizes but it is not necessarily correct to align characters by their most extreme left protrusion. If your first letter was O then aligning the extrema of the curve to the extreme coordinate of the image above would still result in the O appearing indented. Continue this logic and all the initial characters might align to the above image but none will align to each other.</p>
<p>So a line by line aligning to extrema solution seems ineffective.</p>
<p>Alternatively align the content to the gutter by picking a straight sided letter and positioning the text frame so that this straight sided letter appears aligned to the gutter. This way the O will actually protrude into the gutter but might feel optically correct with the image above. However the protrusion of some characters into the gutter will affect the overall white value of the gutters themselves.</p>
<p>So a complete text frame option is not really the answer either and does not have snappy functionality.</p>
<p>Hope somebody else can offer more complete solution.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>InDesign does not have a control like this. And this align procedure is just plausible for display sizes, not for normal/small ones.</p>
<p>Two workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type the first line of text in a text frame. Set format. Convert it to outlines (Crtl+Shift+O). You now have a group of vectors which may be placed exaclet besides your line/margin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design a line. Choose text in path tool, click on the line and type text. Align this text anywhere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both solutions are for one line at a time. Anyway, I think this is not an issue as text in display sizes are usually in small. For text is set in small sizes, don&rsquo;t try to force this alignment. As Andrew (1985) pointed, this leads to misaligned first letter in multiple lines.</p>

<p>Sorry if I wasn&rsquo;t clear. I wasn&rsquo;t expressing an opinion over which inset setting was preferable. Rather I was responding to someone who said &ndash; if I understood correctly &ndash; that an inset of zero resulted in inferior alignment of left-aligned text, which I don&rsquo;t believe is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, I&rsquo;m saying that an inset has no affect on the quality of text alignment within that frame.</p>
<p>Personally, I always use an inset of zero (the default), unless there is some special reason not to. When would I use an inset? Mostly it&rsquo;s in situations where I want some text to be inside a visible box, so I apply a stroke to the text frame and inset the text to provide a margin between the stroke and the text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I run into this situation from time to time, too (often with drop caps). A quick fix that leaves the frame snapped to the guide or margin is to insert a space before the first character in the line, then kern so the character aligns with the guide. This is all with inset spacing at zero. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aligning_5245.png]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I SO wish we could set negative inset spacing values in the text frame options. Here&rsquo;s a good example: take a look at my calendar design. I have a series of text boxes with large white numbers on a gray fill, right justified. I want to bleed all the numbers off the fill while maintaining the editable text without having to create a second layer of fills (which is what I&rsquo;ll have to do to make this work).
