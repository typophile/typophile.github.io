  \"PODER NERD\"?\r\n\r\nhttp://galeria.rlcpress.com.br/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=3967&g2_serialNumber=2\r\n\r\nAnd
  the one which reads \"Guia Tech\", although it's very small to read it in this photo,
  I know. (some \"high-tech italic squarish and awkward font\")\r\n\r\nThank you so
  much!"

    but in italic...what other fonts are similar?\r\n\r\nThanks, akira!"
