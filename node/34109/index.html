  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everybody,
I know there are a lot of posts dealing with kerning issues but I couldn&rsquo;t find an answer to my question there. So here it is:
I&rsquo;m working on a font containing 670 glyphs. I made the class-kerning and got 1500 pairs. There are many pairs in there that don&rsquo;t make sense. So I expanded the kerning to a flat table, resulting in 20000 pairs. In the next step I threw 10000 away or rekerned special combinations.
So my question is, does it still make sense to go with pair-kerning? Is there any text-software that can&rsquo;t handle class-kerning? And what would be the barrier for a pair-kerned font. I read somewhere that 5000 pairs are a maximum. Ah yes and yet another question, what do you think of the compress feature in fontlab 5. If I compress my 10000 pairs I get 2500 &ldquo;class-pairs&rdquo; with exceptions. Would that be the apropriate way to go?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to go insane about this and would appreciate any kind of help.
Thank you guys in advance.</p>
<p>felix</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Class based kerning should be the rule in OT fonts and is more economic, however, single pair kerning is legitimate too. There was another thread with a similar question (class kerning vs single pair kerning in &lsquo;kern&rsquo; feature) but I cannot find it &hellip;
In my experience, &lsquo;Compress&rsquo; does a good job. But make sure you have flagged your kerning classes correctly as leftside/rightside classes &ndash; the checkboxes next to the class name in the classes panel. &lsquo;Compress&rsquo; relies on these settings.</p>
<p>AFAIK, the 5000-pair-maximum was meant for the &lsquo;kern&rsquo; table (not the &lsquo;kern&rsquo; feature), this was about the amount which e.g. XPress 4 could handle.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think I am one of the few &ndash; perhaps the only one &ndash; who sits on the flat pairs kerning side. I have stumbled on too many problems with class-based kerning, among them my own ability to keep things straight.   In the old Type 1 days, we made up fonts of about 400 glyphs. Of course, only 254 could be encoded at once, but all the kerning was in the font.</p>
<p>I would typically have from 1500 to 2500 kern pairs, a lot of them punctuation. You have to pay a lot of attention to sidebearings; sometimes you find yourself kerning a lower-case letter with 20 other lower-case letters, and that&rsquo;s often the sign of an error &ndash; but not always (f comes to mind). Vowels with diacriticals may need side-bearing work.</p>
<p>With OT, contextual alternates can help with awkward pairs, such as an alternate &ldquo;f&rdquo; with any vowels having a grave or macron accent. Frequently that &ldquo;f&rdquo; will work with a wordspace too. Or, with f-accented-vowels, I sometime make ligatures.</p>
<p>I do use class-based kerning, esp. with things like any number followed by any numerator (with &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; fractions).</p>
<p>Another issue is whether or not you plan to ever revisit your font. If not, figuring out what in the world you did six months or a year ago is less of an issue &ndash; unless your customers are complaining too much.</p>
<p>There are always compromises, and I suppose if you pick better ones, you can use more class-based kerning, carefully, and avoid some of the trains wrecks I see in the kerning of many OT fonts.</p>
