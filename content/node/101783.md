body: "Hi, \r\ni'm a bit new in font building (second one) and i have a problem. The
  first one was really simple, one stroke, one fill. \r\nI would like to make a 3D
  font, so i have started with my old one (black stroke, white fill) added the same
  (stroke/fill black) in background but slighlty shifted down-left and hold filled
  with triangle. That doesn't work when i copy/paste in fontlab or glyph.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAlex\r\n\r\nIllustrator:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture
