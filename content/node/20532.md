  body: "'Research-happy' is I will admit is probably hyperbole. Now that I think
    about it again Carl Crossgrove had mentioned Hermann Zapf. I had known of Edward
    Johnston as a type maker not a caligrapher, but I am sure that wrong now. I'll
    have to learn more about him & Edward M. Catich. What I really want to find today
    is folks who are still around & who I can talk or write to. I should have mentioned
    this in the 1st post.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I am interested in letter shape alterations that are made because of inter-letter
    interactions of two, three or more letters. These might occur either consciously/deliberately;
    especially in common words like \u2018the\u2019; or as a semiconscious reflexive
    kind of aesthetic choice as a calligrapher writes. My interest in this kind of
    alteration of letter-forms comes out of some older typophile threads having to
    do with ideas about \u2018bouma*\u2019 and \u2018notan\u2019 and type. When the
    idea of notan came up it was in the context of making better type for immersive
    reading (not calligraphy) by being aware of notan - the white and the black shapes
    - not just the black. At the time it struck me that this kind of awareness would
    have to be very important to European language calligraphers and probably could
    have an imapct on good typography as well now that scripting is available in open
    type. I already knew it was important to Asian language calligraphers especially
    since they have to make significant alteration to elemental forms to make a unified
    chinese characters or Japanese \u2018Kanji\u2019. In Gerrit Noordzji\u2019s book
    \u2018The Stroke\u2019 he talks about getting the need to achieve white/black
    balance a as well. Of course the tasks are different in some significant ways
    but the concern with notan is present in both kinds of calligraphy.\r\n\r\nBut
    it isn\u2019t so much the broad idea of b/w balance or notan that I want to explore;
    it\u2019s specifically the ways in which a European language calligrapher might
    modify letter forms and spacing to achieve good that notan; especially for longer
    running texts. And while some options for achieving this effect overlap to a certain
    extent between typography and calligraphy (for instance - ligatures) the set of
    options for getting good notan is different and perhaps bigger for calligraphers.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    because in general calligraphers have been made to work in a more decorative and
    expressive context rather than in an immersive text context since metal type took
    over the job of long texts it might seem that it\u2019s an academic who has spent
    time analyzing old manuscripts who could help me. But I have a hope that this
    idea is incomplete and that I might also find find some calligraphers who have
    noticed this process of letter alteration & spacing for notan in their work and
    who are interested in discussing it.\r\n\r\n* 'bouma' being the overall shape
    & impression created by a whole word vs the individual letter shapes - look up
    threads here for a more complete idea."

  body: "Eben,\r\n\r\nI just attended a presentation by calligrapher Carl Rohrs, and
    one of his interests is the sort of context-specific alterations to letterforms
    that happen with hand-lettering and calligraphy. He doesn't focus a lot on text,
    or on type design, because his business is signage and display graphics, but he
    would probably be excited to discuss your idea, and probably more excited to find
    and share examples of these alterations. Should I point him your way? I think
    you could say there is a display parallel of the Notan we've been discussing;
    letterers and calligraphers do arrange things for compositional balance and harmony,
    which is relevant. "

    - Right? \r\n\r\nUnfortunately he died in 1995. He does have a son who works in
    stone too.\r\n\r\nAlso, I found this snippet from one of his students:\r\n\r\n\"I
    use a brush. In David Kindersley\u2019s workshop we didn\u2019t use brushes but
    drew our letters on the material with a hard pencil. But that was because we didn\u2019t
    know then how Roman and Greek inscriptions were laid out. It was only much later
    that I discovered the historical basis for the feeling I had about the use of
    brush rather than pen. \r\n\r\nThen, quite by chance, I came across a book written
    by a man called Edward Catich, The Origin of the Serif. Catich was a well respected
    American sign writer who had gone to Italy to research incised Roman letters.
    His research showed that all those precise and immaculately cut inscriptions had
    been laid out with a brush using single strokes. The book just blew my mind away.
    I had never been easy with a pen, but that was the way Kindersley\u2019s workshop
    had taught me to work. I was still drawing everything out. When I worked it was
    Kindersley\u2019s voice that I heard, \u2018My Master\u2019s Voice\u2019. But
    all the same, I could see that my letter shapes were tight \u2013 that I was \u2018obeying
    orders\u2019 rather than finding my own way. I knew I had to find a freedom in
    my work if it was to develop. It was Catich\u2019s book which showed me the way.
    Nevertheless that realisation was terrifying. I knew that Chinese calligraphers,
    who work with the brush, begin their training at the age of seven! I bought every
    kind of ink, brush and paper and started practising. I would use light water colour
    and turn the paper over and over again to save on the cos, but I still ended up
    with enough lettered paper to be able to wallpaper the whole house if I had wanted
    to! For two years of my life every spare moment went into this practice. I had
    to find out for myself how it was done \u2013 there was no one being taught this
    time. One day I woke up and knew I had learned enough to be able to use the technique
    in my work.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.art-outside.com/art-outside/article.php?ID=246\r\n\r\nIt
    makes me want to go look at the Catich book..."
