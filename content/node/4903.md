    but it&#39;s not Melior. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/renault/" target="_blank">Renault</a>
    is also similar. I suspect they were custom designed for the ratings board when

    this. The ratings that were added later--NC-17 and the 13 in PG-13--don&#39;t
    match the style. In the early years of the system, there was also X, and, for
    a short time, M and GP.
