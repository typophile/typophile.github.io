    a contact form to email the member you are wanting to contact. '

    email Jared and see if he could dig it up for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a list of sent items or other features, it's just a way to email folks without
    them publicly posting their email address. Messages are sent by regular email."

  body: Is that beneficial? It almost seems you're outsourcing communication to outside
    Typophile while you probably want people to make use of Typophile as much as possible.
    I would love a PM system.

  body: Well, I reason a bit differently. I have autism and social contact is troubling
    for me. I haven't been on Facebook or chat software in years and I haven't been
    on deviantArt for a year or so and I only dare to check my mail sporadically.
    Getting back on Typophile is my first step to being social again. Having a PM
    system here would mean that I could at least send out personal messages to type
    designers, because mail is quite a big step for me. I hope this Summer I'm able
    to get back on deviantArt and from there get back on Facebook and mail again.
    It's a big challenge though. The fact that everything on the Internet is so connected
    causes anxiety for me. I like closed systems, where I know what to expect and
    not much can go wrong.

    to manage than all these thoughtful, eloquent \u2013and public\u2013 posts you've
    been making here?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It's a matter of responsibility. I have a reduced capacity (for responsibility)
    and I need to keep my world small to maintain it. Years ago I did a lot of freelance
    work and eventually I took on too much responsibility and things went wrong; in
    2011 my whole world just collapsed. Since then I haven't been able to handle the
    responsibility to work for clients. I do a few projects here and there behind
    the curtains but I'm certainly not publicly available. Mails are hard for me because
    of the expectations people naturally have of communication. On this forum, I don't
    feel like a response is expected of me. I enjoy a certain freedom here. deviantArt
    is a sort of in-between world of a forum like this and Facebook, where people
    have higher expectations regarding communication. As such I see it as a natural
    step that I will first make my way back to deviantArt before I dare to take the
    next step. I need to expand my world slowly and carefully. If it expands too fast,
    I will likely suffer mentally and my world will collapse again.
