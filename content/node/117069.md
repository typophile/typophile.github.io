  body: "Mike I agree it's not an exact match,\r\nbut if you look at the general style
    of /E /h /w /b /g you may agree that this is not a coincidence and the tattoo-artist
    has probably based on this font."

  body: Very wierd. I'm seeing the same not-a-tattoo image as Mike. If I copy and
    paste your link, Fivos, I again get the image Mike is seeing.

  body: "Weird indeed... \r\nMaybe this is an problem related to how Typophile server
    handles/stores images.\r\n\"image_155.jpg\" (the last portion of link) is a very
    generic and common filename\r\nand in some weird way it might have been (erroneously)
    re-used by the Typophile server.\r\n\r\nMike could you try to use the link on
    a different browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, etc) to check if you get
    the same result?\r\nAnother option could be to clear the cache of your current
    browser.\r\n"

  body: "Yikes. I tried it in IE and got the proper tattoo image. Back to Chrome and
    it yields the correct image now.\r\n\r\nThe file name explanation would seem to
    make sense -- except that you'd think we'd see it often with image_1.jpg and such."
