body: "There was a thread on this, but it accidentally got deleted when I tried to
  delete the old PDF specimen with a new one, not realizing it would delete the thread
  and not the file.\r\n\r\nApologies to all those who replied.\r\n\r\nHere is, more
  or less, my rationale and the updated PDF specimen attached below:\r\n\r\n<em>Overview</em>\r\n\r\nIn
  fingerspelling, a handshape indicates a letter, which could be depicted from a range
  of complex pictoral representations to simple systematic strokes. At small sizes,
  many handforms (a, e, m, n, s, t) could be relatively difficult to distinguish from.
  The creation of such a font includes several parameters: the limitation of using
  only positive and negative space, stroke (and counter) thickness, and how complex
  or simple the hand, fingers, and detail should be. Since each letter contains more
  strokes than English characters, it is difficult, if not impossible, to create a
  highly legible font intended for small sizes. Thus, the use of a fingerspelling
  font should only be used as display type, for instructional or cultural purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter
  studying and comparing the subtle differences of the manual alphabet, and what visual
  cues each hand presents, some important parameters were established. Other than
  the form of the hand itself, the fingernails are powerful visual cues that distinguishes
  similar letters, which is also why a bold version could be created. Since the manual
  alphabet is communicated with human hands, representing the font in human-like forms
  is easier to pick up than say, hands in thick winter gloves or systematic semi-abstract
  forms that derive away from naturally recognizable forms. By keeping the bony angular
  forms of the hand, important visual cues are revealed from the bone structure. With
  a recognizable form of the hand, excess inner detail can be eliminated and thus,
  retain simplicity without inducing complexity to maintain legibility. In addition,
  all of the letters designed are what one would see if somebody in front of you was
  reciting the manual alphabet, to keep consistency without seeing irregular angles.\r\n\r\nStroke
  width was a difficult decision to make for the outlined regular version. If the
  stroke width were to be thick, logically it would be easier to see; however, the
  bone structure of the hand would lose its angularity and inner detail would jumble
  together to lose recognizability. In short, the thicker the lines, the less human
  the hands appear. Nonetheless, since the font was designed for display, the forms
  remain intact at 36 points in print, at minimum. Since there are two levels of recognizability,
  the hand as a whole and the inner detail of the hand, the outer stroke of each character
  is slightly thicker. While each character is complex enough on its own, the stroke
  width is consistent in size throughout for simplicity. Finally, since outlined handshapes
  can never be thicker than the English alphabet at a similar point size, a filled
  (bold) version was created to counter the lack of visual color, but yet still remain
  legible."

  body: "<strong>drapeaux:</strong> In response to your comment,\r\n\r\n<cite>This
    is hot. You did a really great job - however I have some quirks ...\r\n\r\nThe
    J needs to be tilted downwards a slant more - I believe that the hand shape of
    J would be easily superimposed with the letter O resembling the sign for intercourse
    - maybe make it a little harder to do that. ( I\u2019m pretty sure teenagers and
    children will get very creative with the hand shapes.)\r\n\r\nThe P should be
    a slant hint lower it is a weeee bit too high in the shape formation , thats the
    first thing i caught - otherwise it is a perfect shape-form with the hand curves
    knuckles and thumb positioning.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest to you - maybe make the actual
    letter form of Z behind the shape so that it pops out? (perhaps this is more graphical
    than useful? I don\u2019t know I\u2019m a designer/artist - I\u2019m not sure
    what my opinion stands on that as an native ASL speaker)\r\n\r\nI realllllllly
    LOVE the numbers - this has to be by far the BEST set of hand shapes I\u2019ve
    seen, i would absolutely LOVE to see a set that follows hand shapes! ( that would
    be particularly useful in making documentation and educational books in which
    corresponds to ASL)\r\n\r\nBest of luck with this!</cite>\r\n\r\nThanks for your
    comments, and I appreciate the kind words!\r\n\r\nI never thought about the superimposing
    of the letter <em>j</em> and <em>o</em> to signify intercourse, but I did add
    a stroke to signify motion (where the previous version did not have a stroke.)
    The <em>j</em> as you see is what would be seen at the end of the motion. It's
    a good suggestion, and I'll see if I can figure out how to prevent that, but then
    again, I can't prevent the number 1 rotated 90 degrees clockwise and <em>o</em>
    superimposed ;)\r\n\r\nI agree with your comment about the letter <em>p</em>.
    It should be a bit lower, and when I do a revision, I'll definitely fix that.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what you mean by the actual letter form of <em>z</em> behind the shape?
    Can you elaborate a bit more on that please? The lines I have there represents
    motion.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your kind words. I wouldn't mind expanding
    the project, or doing a new set in the BSL (British Sign Language) manual alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Quincunx</em>:
    That method worked! Thank you."
