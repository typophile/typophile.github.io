  body: 'ok so maybe there is just one of us! <BR> <BR>anyway, so i wondering then
    if a swash is an extension of handwriting &#40;which i believe it is, correct
    me if i&#39;m wrong&#41; then would the loop that falls below the baseline of
    a lowercase f be considered a swash in a script typeface? or would a swash only
    refer the the ornimental gestures generally found in caps? '

  body: The lower part of a script f would not normally be a swash, unless it was
    unusually flamboyant. Generally swashes are extra/alternate characters for a Script
    font, and while they are most often embellishments of the upper case letters,
    they could also be special beginning or ending flourishes on lower case letters.
    Adobe Bickham is a good example of a font with both kinds of swashes. See attached.<img

    It paints its own picture. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure you are aware of what a swash
    is. In type it&#39;s an ornamental extension or pickup stroke on a cap, or a finial
    stroke to a lowercase e,m,n,t, in the italic. <BR> <BR>In a script face like Bickham
    there is a lot of opportunity to swash. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer
