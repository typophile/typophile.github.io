  \"fraktura\". Alot of work ahead but i\xB4m really interested in your opinion.It\xB4s
  just the first try to see if it could work...\r\n\r\nthanks for your critique!  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    One gut reaction, though, is that the X looks like a swastika. (Sorry.)

  body: "I think the emphasis on the circle is the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nFraktur
    capitals are enlarged uncials rather than ornamented Roman caps.\r\n\r\nUnger
    Fraktur offers several advantages as a model. It was developed in Berlin. It was
    Paul Renner's preferred fraktur when he used one.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

  body: "thanks for the comments!\r\n\r\nI know that it is not really like a fraktur.
    But I wanted to keep the geometric futura style\r\nlike stright strokes and round
    circles and just give it the flavour of an blackletter/fraktur font.But i see
    what you say about the circles!Some work some not I think...maybe I should take
    some diffrent sizes to get more possibilities."

  body: "I really like this.\r\n\r\nAre you still working on this? There are some
    things that bug me like the M and W having the one vertical stroke that breaks
    their balance. The V as well but it bothers me a lot less.\r\n\r\nI think its
    legible yet deconstructive and industrial. The upper case B I have trouble making
    out a bit but besides that I get all the characters."

  body: "Nice alphabet. Some of the letters are actually reminding me of posters from
    Sci-Fi Movies but regarding to readabilty I have some suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn the
    alphabetical context I can read all the letters. But when I imagine seeing them
    in practical usage I have problems with some capital letters (the lowercase letters
    are all working for me).\r\n\r\n<strong>B:</strong> Almost looks like \"G\". Maybe
    try to make the upper shoulder like in \"R\" and \"P\".\r\n<strong>I:</strong>
    Can easily be confused with an \"L\".\r\n\r\nI don't understand the concept behind
    the roundings of your capital letters. Sometimes the thick roundings are a fundamental
    part of the letters (like in \"C\", \"D\", \"G\" ...) and sometimes they are just
    decoration (like in \"E\", \"F\", \"H\" ...). Nevertheless you have thin roundings
    (like in \"O\", \"Q\" ...) that are a fundamental part of the letter. It seems
    too inconsistent which conflicts with the idea of geometry. Might it be possible
    to use thick strokes for fundamental parts and thin strokes for decoration? This
    way the \"E\" e.g. looks like a combination of a vertically flipped \"D\" and
    an \"E\".\r\n\r\nI agree on what pentapus wrote about \"M\" and \"W\".\r\n\r\nOne
    more thing -> maybe flip the \"t\" vertically to give it a more typical look.\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking forward to seeing more from you \"Fraktura\""
