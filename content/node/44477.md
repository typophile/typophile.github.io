body: "I would appreciate some critique on this logotype. Especially on the kerning,
  i know its not perfect, but kerning script fonts like this can be a bit tricky.
  The face is Emily, and it was going to be used for a female fashion label.\r\nCheers\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Birgull_Web_5491.jpg]"

  body: "The U looks a bit like an A in my opinion, maybe the left stroke should echo
    the right? But thats to do with the face im guessing.\r\n\r\nAlso think the U
    has too much space, perhaps straightening the strokes will help to judge the kerning
    better, especially in proportion to the Ls and G?"

  body: "Thanks for the advice.\r\nI straightened the stroke of the u, and it worked
    out quite all right. I also closed the counter of the g.\r\nIt still needs a lot
    of cleaning up though.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/birgull_Web02_5149.jpg]"

  body: I would like you to look at making the graphic underline a heavier or lighter
    weight. You need some separation from the name. You have made the graphic as important
    as the name, Not a great idea. Think about it.

  body: imo the original weight was better. i'm going back and forth on the simplicity
    of the stroke or the extra swirl. I might go without it.

  body: "I like the original, but see the the 'u' is a little off. What about making
    the curl tighter? (I also like the second.) I do like the new resolve on the 'rg'
    pair though.\r\n\r\nThe first solution, with the large exiting swash balances
    the B. This is a logotype, no? Don't box it in too much if it is screaming to
    be free."

    finish the underline and balance the B.

    dirty example, but maybe the idea is worth exploring? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Birgull_Web_5491

    the B and g are too close. There needs to be more of a difference (ala Eileen's
    suggestion)

  body: That is nice. I still think the underline should be swashy. But, don't you
    feel that now you've added weight the bottom bowl of the g? You've basically filled
    it with white. Or am I thinking too much?
