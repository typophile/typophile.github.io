		<div class="commentbody">Golly, Hrant, you're never one to dwell on the subtleties, nuances and counter-evidential examples are you? Why look at books when you can just make broad general assertions! There are many examples of soft rag in the manuscript and print traditions of Western Europe, but the dominant model in the Western formal book manuscript was justification by letter expansion and contraction, which is itself a very fluid technique, not remotely 'absolutist'. Gutenberg emulated this technique in the 42-line Bible, but within a few years it was abandoned in favour of efficiency.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hector, Bringhurst is right. <BR> <BR>Gerald, I think you misinterpreted Hrant's bluster.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Full justification is a primitive Enlightenment fetish that Modernism has now carved into our brains.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, which is it Hrant? Is it classical Roman absolutism? Is it mediaeval manuscript practice and incunabula printing? Is it enlightenment fetishism and modernist ideology? <BR> <BR>Most of the surviving Roman manuscripts I've seen are not justified; in fact, they are often models of the kind of soft rag you speak of so admiringly. So maybe you shouldn't blame the Romans. <BR> <BR>How about the scriptorium monks of the Middle Ages? Yes, they're probably the guilty party, but they didn't abuse letter or word spacing to achieve their justification: they broke words with delightful lack of concern for 'hyphenation rules', and widened and compressed letterforms often with great sensitivity. So, yes, they justified text but they did it bloody well. And before you get hot under the collar about readability, please remember that reading in the Middle Ages meant reading <i>aloud</i>, not silent, immersive reading. Gutenberg also did justification with great sensitivity, and if you think the 42-line Bible is 'a painting, not a book' I suggest you find someone who will let you sit down and leaf through a copy: that, sir, is most definitely a book. <BR> <BR>The so-called Enlightenment? Okay, now we're beginning to see some pretty bad justification, but we're also seeing looser letterspacing generally, and other problems. So perhaps this is indeed where your scorn should land. <BR> <BR>Modernism? Oh, the irony: modernists, the ideological champions of ragged-right typography, the scourge of the justified text, blamed for making justified texts the norm. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>who cares about actual</i> reading&hellip; <BR> <BR>In case you havn't noticed, Hrant, people have been reading fully justified texts fully well for <i>hundreds of years</i>. You continue to treat reading as if it were some incredibly fragile, difficult to achieve thing. It's not: it's incredibly robust and ready for just about anything that bad typographers can throw at it. This is not to say that we should accept bad typography and not try to do better, but suggesting that justified text is somehow unreadable is irrational in the face of so many centuries of reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, <BR> <BR>Adobe certainly considered using MM technology in this fashion. There are a couple of key problems with it, however. First, the width axis setting of an MM font is not predictably deterministic in its effect on the width of a line. The programming difficulty and performance penalty of having to deal with each glyph's continuously variable degrees of expansion/contraction would have both been huge. Performance in interaction with the paragraph composer would have been a real problem. <BR> <BR>Technical difficulties aside, how many MM serifed text typefaces were made with a width axis? Kepler was one. Minion had a mild width axis, but only in one direction (more condensed than regular). There were probably others, but I can't think of them offhand. <BR> <BR>All of this is sort of moot, of course, since Adobe made the decision to stop doing MMs around the same time that InDesign 1.0 was finishing development. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Eric Menninga explained some of this to me in Vancouver. To expand a little on what Thomas described, for those who didn't immediately catch the implications (as I didn't at first): <BR> <BR>Any given glyph will vary by a different amount when widened according to an intelligent, MM-based scheme (as opposed to wholesale percentage scaling) &ndash; for instance, the change in an 'm' is going to be proportionately greater than that of an 'i' (which wouldn't really widen much, if at all).  <BR> <BR>You can't simply determine that a given line is 96% of the full line length and then just expand it 104.1667% (as you would with brute, horizontal scaling). (Which, by the way, I think was a foolish, misleading, and mistaken feature to include in InDesign.) <BR> <BR>A change in width axis will have a greater effect on a seven-letter word like &quot;mammals&quot; than, say, &quot;fillies.&quot; When attempting to justify a line with intelligent width expansion, the amount of adjustment will be highly dependent upon the specific individual characters in each line.  <BR> <BR>Calculating the overall width setting on an MM axis for any given line, determined by all the interrelated variations of each of the characters in the line, would, as Thomas says, take too much of a toll on performance.  <BR> <BR>I hope this explanation makes sense and is helpful. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

What we typically think of as fully justified text is text that is justified to a fixed margin. If you care about what the rag of 'unjustified' text looks like, then I would argue that you are interested in justifying it, but justifying it <i>to a variable margin</i>. In effect, you are saying, 'I want a rag, but I don't want the rag to fall outside this range, i.e. no lines should be shorter than the distance X from the story margin'. This is justified text, because you are not simply lining up the letters one after another and letting the rag fall where it will: you are doing the work of deciding what the rag should look like.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not poking fun of anyone. I'm saying that there are different kinds of rags &ndash; basically, tidy rags and messy rags &ndash; and that there are several possible approaches to making a tidy rag. A messy rag is one in which you have some lines that are much shorter or longer than average. A tidy rag is one in which all the lines fall within a fairly narrow range. <BR> <BR>As regards 'rubber type', you're saying that Gutenberg and Zapf belong in rubber rooms?

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Well, which is it Hrant? <BR> <BR>It's convenient being so literal, isn't it? <BR> <BR>I'm talking about the undercurrent, not exactly how the Romans justified their paragraphs, not what Copernicus discovered, and not what Bayer [thought he] liked. There's a consistent stream running through history since the Romans: <BR> <BR>The Romans &quot;borrowed&quot; the Greek culture to create the bulk of their own, but they didn't inherit any of their wonderful pragmatism*. The Romans -being imperialists- were driven by Order and Formality, a desire to <i>control</i> (as opposed to the Greek desire to <i>understand</i>). This translated to the desire to control Nature during the Enlightenment, and in the microcosm of typography Modernism turned this into nice rectangular blocks. <BR> <BR>* That's why Rome is when Western Culture really started - Greece was a hybrid/transit between East and West. The Ancient Greeks would cry laughing at the way the cornerstone they laid was used to bludgeon instead of build. <BR> <BR>The point isn't how little justified or ragged paragraphs affect readability (I agree it's not qualitatively very relevant), it's what's <i>under</i> them: the desire for superficial control, versus the desire for true harmony, which is never absolute. This is paralleled for example in the thought that all single letters are critical in reading (because that makes it more controlled), versus the reality that reading is an extremely heurtistic, nebulous activity. It is also paralleled in the imposition of identical vertical proportions in Latin/Cyrillic type design: it <i>looks</i> better on the surface, but in truth it is a violation of functionality. And it is also paralleled in religious fundamentalism; the Talibaan are much more Western than they think! <BR> <BR>The Romans were much more superficial than the Greeks, and we're still paying for it, in typography, politics, and everything in between. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; If you don't like ragged type</div>
