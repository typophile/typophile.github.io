    should try to set the box with the title in some other way, the stairs that appears
    sometimes i like it and sometimes not. <BR> <BR>you FHD monogram is very distinctive

  body: 'JARED <BR>did you smash the type or stretch it?? in #1 &amp; #3? It has a
    very squashed,  cluastrophobic feel which you may not want. You should also determine
    whether the name of your business is one word, or 2...If you are into the ligature
    idea, look at how the fl ligature is often constructed. The f doesnt need to curve
    completely around to the stem of the l...the l and f usually collide, not blend
    into each other. <BR>Also, in #3, I keep seeing &#34;Ah&#34; and grain silos.
    <BR> <BR>I would have to say that #2 is the strongest idea. But, work with the
    monogram a little bit more, maybe enlarging the black square. If you use it though,
    I would definately ditch the type next to it. They look like two different elements
    which coincidentally butted up against each other...Also maybe something less
    geometric would work better for the monogram concept---something less German Aircraft
    factory, circa WW2 &#40;das fairhaus&#41; <BR>Could you find a more interesting
    sans serif to work with? Or maybe experiment with handwriting---or even color
    instead of black?'

  body: Thanks for the comments, my partner felt that the 2nd logo looked somewhat
    dated, which isn&#39;t exactly what we&#39;re going for the 3rd one is definatly
    more fun feeling but still isn&#39;t quite what we were looking for, the 1st one
    is remenicent of another logotype for a company that i can&#39;t put my finger
    on, i&#39;m not entirely sure about a serifed typeface for the monogram, as it
    stands it really makes me think of some sort of roman alphabet chop mark. i&#39;m
    somewhat at a loss about how to integrate the whole name with it effectivly

    poster - ditch or move the &#34;design&#34;. <BR> <BR>The #3 monogram reversed
    in the middle of a coloured box might look nice. If you must put the name next
    to the box, give it some space - some poise - and put it on one line if possible.
    Then you can use the logo with and without the logotype. <BR> <BR>Paul'

    <BR> <BR>Jared, I don&#39;t think you need the box at all. The FHD  <BR>ligature
    and the fh ligature have nice potential. And the <BR>name Fairhouse is nice. <BR>
    <BR>I also agree that you don&#39;t need the word &#39;design.&#39; Perhaps  <BR>use
    the full name only in formal communications. <BR> <BR>As much as I&#39;m against

  body: by the way, i&#39;m jared&#39;s &#34;business partner&#34; as he mentioned
    in the first post.  I&#39;m the one who did the first fairhouse logo, knocked
    out on a black rectangle, and i also did the silos thing.  those silo ones were
    done pretty quick and were meant to just throw out more possibilities.  and yes
    i stretched the typeface on that first one &#40;which i dont normally do, but
    i thought Geneva was just too common of a font and had to be changed, and the
    computer i was on didn&#39;t have all the fonts in the world&#41; <BR> <BR>anyway,
    i really appreciate all the visual modifications everyone has done, and even the
    sketches which were not based off of the first post at all... it&#39;s great that
    everyone is really thinking and helping. <BR> <BR>i think we&#39;ve got to do
    something different here.  i don&#39;t know where this is all going, but i hope
    it stops in a good place.  now here&#39;s another idea i threw together today...it&#39;s
    intended to be just a mark;  a logotype could go next to it, or under it, or inside
    it... please tell me what you think of it... thanks <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13790.gif"

    of a pinwheel shape? The squareness at the center is reminiscent of a swastika
    &#40;This may be just me&#41;. You might try breaking the circuit to alleviate
    this feeling as well. <BR> <BR>In any case, in my tinkering I came up with an
    interesting, and I believe more pleasing alternate. What if you extend both the
    ascending and descending small tips flush with the tops of the f&#39;s, delete
    the left and right tips. and break the box into an F character and an H. &#40;note
    you will also need to extend the hook of the f.&#41; The result is an FH melded
    into a pinwheel. <BR> <BR>I hope this makes sense.  <BR> <BR>Andrew
