  Sunday Morning</a> yesterday about type? It was a few minutes long and featured
  interviews of Steven Heller and Jonathan Hoefler. It was predictably shallow, but
  fairly well informed. It reminded me a bit of the famous Erik Speikermann \"<a href=\"http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1097932338/E1823448250/index.html\">Typomania</a>\"
  video (but without the Tom Tom Club music).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI don't normally
  watch this program, but my parents do and thoughtfully TIVOed it for me so I could
  see it. I checked the CBS website and they don't have the item viewable online."

  body: "Update: I called my dad about it and he's already moved the footage from
    the DVR to digital camcorder to his Powerbook.* The file is too big to email (almost
    a gig), so I'm going to pick it up in the next day or so. As soon as I get a chance,
    I will get it down to web-viewable size and post a link or something here.\r\n\r\n*
    I'm lucky that my dad, who turned 76 this year, is so tech-savvy. Most people
    his age can barely cope with a mouse."

    I'll know for sure when I get the file.

    my grandfather who is in his 90's and has been scanning photos of birds, printing
    them out on canvas paper and painting over the birds and adding a background.
    And now he wants me to create a web site for him to promote his paintings. Not
    everyone who is past retirement age is technophobic :)"

    mom's sister, who is about the same age as my dad, used to use a Mac. My dad and
    I would spend hours on the phone with her explaining the simplest things (like
    opening a folder icon). And then we'd have to start all over again the next time
    she called because she immediately forgot it all. I don't remember why, but at
    one point, she decided to switch to a PC that offered unlimited free phone support.
    That was one case when I was happy when someone switched from the Mac, but I feel
    sorry for the phone support people at Gateway."
