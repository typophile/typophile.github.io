  interest in type design for probably just as long I haven't really posted here a
  lot. I will be seeking critique on my fonts upon me reaching something of substance
  that I need help with, but that's along way off. I hope to get to know many of you
  over the next few months.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check some of my work out,\r\nMy
  formal portfolio is <a href=\"http://davethedesigner.net\">here</a>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nMy
  Path to Type Blog logging my progress is <a href=\"http://pathtotype.blogspot.com\">here</a>
  \r\n\r\nThe more people looking at my blog, the more pressure on me and the less
  chance I slack off!\r\n\r\nta!"
