body: "Here is my first attempt at a slab serif face, still in its earliest stages.
  For now, I just have the 24 basic letters of the alphabet in uppercase and lowercase
  and some bare-minimum punctuation.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration: I was daydreaming about
  how I'd go about designing a business card of my own; I've never had one. Maybe
  I'd like to see my name in distinctive slab serifs letterpressed onto some good
  quality business-card paper. The design elements would be severe geometric slab
  serifs, with straight horizontal and vertical lines emphasized, but the forms would
  also hint at some elegant text faces. Actually, I originally had a more distinctive
  display face in mind (just to set my full name, nothing else), but it seems to have
  evolved a bit to something with potential to work for longer passages of text.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I came up with some weird stylized designs for the lowercase a and g, and finished
  the rest of the alphabet on loosely similar principles.\r\n\r\nI thought this would
  be a good one to put on the critique forum, so I came back to the design after a
  few weeks' break and touched up the forms to make them a bit more presentable to
  the Typophile readers. I gave up the strictly rectangular vertical serifs (on E,
  z, etc.) for now. The whole thing is still at a very rough stage--I fixed the most
  egregious of the stem weight inconsistencies and overshoot problems, but several
  probably remain. I haven't even begun to look at spacing.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking
  for basic solutions. I wasn't sure how to treat the lowercase f and r, and the lowercase
  g isn't still quite satisfactory. I'd appreciate any suggestions on these design
  issues.\r\n\r\nJongseong\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArmaHand_4908.gif]"

  body: "My comment just has to with the name of your font: I immediately remembered
    that a Finnish guy had already made a font named Armadillo \u2013 I had seen it
    in his <a href=\"http://www.uiah.fi/frontpage.asp?path=1866\">UIAH</a> thesis.
    I guess <a href=\"https://arsca.linneanet.fi/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v3=1&ti=1,1&SEQ=20070421170825&Search%5FArg=armadillo&SL=None&Search%5FCode=TALL&CNT=50&PID=28495&SID=4\">this</a>
    is the thesis. The author's name is Jukka Aalto."

  body: Then I'll be taking font name suggestions as well. Thanks for pointing that
    out--I just didn't want to post an untitled font, and it took me a minute or so
    to come up with 'Armadillo' (it takes a lot of imagination, but many of the shapes
    in the lowercase remind me of a stylized armadillo). I guess I didn't check carefully
    enough whether the name was taken. I'll make the appropriate changes as soon as
    I find a new working name for the font.
