  body: "It is actually an interesting question. You mention, honestly, that you have
    exhibited trollish behavior. I would guess that what you are talking about is,
    in a sense, playing devil's advocate, as it is said, to stimulate and push a discussion
    forward. I think this is a very good point.\r\n\r\nAs far as the ethnicity issue,
    I would mention that I recently fed a troll a Borat flavored morsel. I really
    see a similarity. I guess there are those that treat a board as a holy receptacle
    of knowledge where no sideways comments or anything that does not explicitly contribute
    to the discussion should be tolerated. Personally, I believe a well crafted digression
    can be a welcome contribution.\r\n\r\nConsider the specifics here though. Why
    would anyone attack E.S. for owning \"cool fonts\". It isn't a legit crit\u2014just
    a silly joke. One that I admit I do not get the point of at all."

    probably a fair comparison. Whether or not you find that sort of thing funny or
    even acceptable is of course another matter.\r\n\r\nChristopher, a troll (in this
    context) is basically a forum member who posts argumentative, rude, or controversial
    material, just for the sake of riling others. They're pretty rare on Typophile
    (as a member of several gaming forums it's pretty blissful spending some time
    here!)\r\n\r\nA fuller explanation can be found <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)'>here</a>.\r\n\r\nTake

    is not a problem for most people. Lots of people, probably most people, don\u2019t

    has not come across this most noteworthy of all sans from the complete Orcfont
    family. This innovative and ground breaking font is so revolutionary as to be
    totally devoid of substance all together. Its characterless features are mind
    numbing in their simplicity without one redeeming virtue. What is most striking
    in 'San Intelligence' is not what appears to the eye, but what banality has gone
    on in its creation and development.\r\nA watershed of type design which no other
    can come close to, or even wish to.\r\n\r\n'Sans Intelligence' is pure type, its
    perfection is an indefinable property that only sensitive critics (liken to yourself,
    Gui Yong) can intuitively recognise in a work of art. Unfortunately insensitive
    critics (such as Mr Typerror - please excuse his ignorance) are unable to appreciate
    its full and unique magnificence.  \r\n"
