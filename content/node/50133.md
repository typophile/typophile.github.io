body: "Here's a weird problem (of many weird problems since moving over to windows
  vista). I've set up an ornament feature in my latest script font. It works fine
  on a Windows XP machine with Illustrator CS but on a Windows Vista machine using
  Illustrator CS2 here is what happens.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/orna_4416.jpg]\r\n\r\nas
  you can see from the picture, when the first sequence is typed out (from the glyph
  menu in illustrator) what I get is not what I typed. The last ornament turns into
  the next ornament typed. This is a very basic and simple ornm feature:\r\n\r\nfeature
  ornm {\r\n  sub bullet from @ornaments;\r\n} ornm;\r\n\r\n@ornaments = [orn.01 orn.02
  orn.03 orn.07 orn.05 orn.06 orn.04 orn.08 orn.09 orn.10 orn.11 orn.12 orn.13 orn.14
  orn.15];\r\n\r\nfeature ornm; is also placed in the aalt feature at the very bottom.\r\n\r\nIs
  this a bug in Vista? Illustrator CS2? or the two combined? Would updating Illustrator
  help? Anyone have similar problems when testing OT fonts in Vista?\r\n\r\n"

    to be fixed in CS3.
