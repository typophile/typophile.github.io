    sense. Now if only the entire family didn''t cost as much as a transatlantic flight
    I''d be a jolly trooper. '

  body: It is expensive indeed, but I guess Hoefler & Frere-Jones feel this family
    is worth the price they ask for it. And apparently quite a few people agree. Of
    course you could argue that it's a shame its price tag puts it out of reach of
    some people, but it all depends on what's most important to you and what you want
    to spend your money on. :^)
