  with titling usage in mind. <BR> <BR>I really enjoy playing with grays, but I also
  enjoy tinkering with notchy designs as well. <BR> <BR>In fact, I&#39;m torn as to
  the true nature of what a pixel font might strive to be: emulate the fluid nature
  of outline fonts, or: damn the torpedos and celebrate the stepping visuals of stacked
  blocks. <BR> <BR>At any rate, Fredman is open for examination. Any feedback is welcome.

    see grays as an emulation of outlines. <BR>&#34;Gray pixels are people too.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>One way grays can help on their own merit is by balancing color better.
    For example look at your 2-pixel UC &#34;V&#34;: a touch of gray on the insides
    would make it: nicely darker; seem less wide. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Here are a few versions of a serif to go with the sans. One that stays within
    the boyancy of the sans, and one that moves toward better readability. <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Well, the italics variants are a fun challenge. They may or may not work
    ultimately, but I can&#39;t help trying to make them work. Of course, grays would
    fix this right up, but, this is a 1-bit exercise for now. <BR> <BR>The same two
    serifs have been tilted, with the top one being cleaned up and the bottom one
    left raw. Not surprisingly, the bottom graphic is the most faithful to the non-italic
    members of the family. <BR> <BR>And although I like taking pixel designs towards
    notchiness sometimes, I only like it if it looks like its been done by design.
    This is where the bold italics below falters, although it does benefit from the
    heavy line weight to carry the eye past some of its crags and holes. <BR> <BR>I
    like the regular italic version better, but it faulters in a different way: in
    an effort to clean up the letters and give them uniformity across the set, a large
    portion of the style set forth by the non italics members is lost. In fact, characters
    stretch the limits of acceptability from bold to regular within the italics. <BR>
    <BR>Any thoughts or critiques are most welcome! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53372.gif"

  body: I decided to take the direction the serif italics &#40;above&#41; wanted to
    go in, emphasizing letterforms that lent themselves to the italics diagonals,
    and ended up with another font. <BR> <BR>I worked the italics backward graphicallly
    to reach the non-italic version of the font. It&#39;s not cutting edge, but I
    do like the congruency between the italic and non italic sets, and of course,
    the fact that the italics don&#39;t look like an afterthought when compared to
    the non italics. <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53468.gif"

  body: no, it&#39;s named after a rosy-cheeked blonde boy with glasses and purple
    tiedye shirts, who was a friend of mine in the fourth grade and who stole the
    affection of a certain girl in our class. <BR> <BR>what made matters worse was
    that at the time, the fourth grade was when boys actually admitted to one another
    that they liked girls at all, which made holding hands and awkward kisses possible,
    and therefore inevitable. <BR> <BR>which meant that at recess there was repeated,
    quantifiable proof that this girl only had eyes for him and wasn&#39;t even THINKING
    about me. <BR> <BR>i was jealous of him after that, but always liked his last
    name. he coined his own nickname after it, in fact. mag wheels. eric &#34;mag
    wheels&#34; magnuson. <BR> <BR>that font looked to me like a fast car &#40;well,
    you know&#41;, and fast cars ought to have cool wheels. so, if this font were
    to have wheels, they&#39;d be mag wheels.
