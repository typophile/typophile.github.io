    units &#40;FL&#41;  <BR> <BR>When FontLab Preferences / General / Do not rescale
    EPS files is disabled, then FontLab will always automatically rescale your drawing
    to be 70% of the UPM size high. When your font has 1000 UPM, FontLab will make
    your drawing 700 units high.  <BR> <BR>When the preferences option is enabled,
    then FontLab will not rescale anything. 1 pt will be equal 1 FontLab unit, to
    1 inch will be equal 72 FontLab units.  <BR> <BR>This is explained in the manual
    and in the article <a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=2675"
