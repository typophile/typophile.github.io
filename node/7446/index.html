		<div class="commentbody">This is also probably related to the different paths fonts with TrueType and fonts with PostScript outlines take in Windows. Fonts with TrueType outlines are rendered using the TrueType rasterizer licensed from Apple but maintained by Microsoft. Fonts with PostScript outlines (including OpenType CFF fonts) are rendered using the PostScript font rasterizer supplied and maintained by Adobe - this comes built in to Windows 2000 and XP, but was an add-on (Adobe Type Manager) for earlier version of Windows.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: thanks for the feedback. You're certainly right that the language about changing glyph shape needs improving; I'm trying to distinguish it from the more common technique of displacing individual knot and control points relative to the underlying grid. A small amount of squooshing, while subtle, does not count as leaving the shape completely unchanged. <BR> <BR>Simon: yes, the constraints are pretty different when you're trying to be WYSIWYG than if you can widen both glyph shape and spacing at small sizes. <BR> <BR>I hope to have a live demo up pretty soon so people can kick the tires extensively.</div>

Obviously, when talking about how text looks and, more importantly, reads best on screen one has to deal with the difficulty that unless you are sitting next to someone looking at exactly the same screen &ndash; taking it in turns, in fact, to sit directly in front of the screen &ndash; the number of variables involved from native resolution, gamma, manufacturer make it very difficult to have a meaningful discussion. And that's just talking about mechanical variables, and not human variables such as colour sensitivity, which come in to play with ClearType, especially on lower resolution screens.* As noted on the graphic, the red line is 6.1 cm long on my screen, which will give you some idea of the impact of resolution on this discussion. <BR> <BR>*As noted in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/51334.html?1099351731">this thread</a>, which should really be moved to the General Discussion forum.</div>

Also, you say &quot;7 point&quot;, but it's important to realize that the lc vertical span is 12 pixels. That's plenty of room for manual anti-aliasing to do a better job, including curve fidelity (like look at the overly aliased bottom-left of the first &quot;e&quot;). The other problem of course is that glyph rendering is not consistent (which I think is not a problem accross saccades, but sometimes might be within a single fixation). BTW, what font is that? Assuming it's not a[n existing] core font, how would Times and Arial look? <BR> <BR>* Otherwise I think my display is probably very close to yours.</div>

David Earl's example of ClearType tuned to reduce colour artifacts is a good demonstration of the relationship of colour and contrast in CT rendering: I wouldn't use that kind of tuning, because it reduces the contrast, which has an impact on what you like to call notan. <BR> <BR>Of course, I don't normally read text on screen at 7pt and, obviously, at that size the pixel patterns get quite coarse. That fact that CT makes this recognisable as an individual typeface at that size is itself remarkable. The typeface is Constantia. <BR> <BR><i>The other problem of course is that glyph rendering is not consistent (which I think is not a problem accross saccades, but sometimes might be within a single fixation).</i> <BR> <BR>I've not seen any evidence that this presents a problem, even in a single fixation, so long as contrast is maintained. At this very small size, the differences are more noticeable than they would be typically, and I think the improvements in letterspacing from subpixel positioning benefit more than the variation in rendering harms. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>There are some good things about CT (and other subpixel methods), but I think the key thing to remember is that it's simply The Next Big Thing*, which means it gets more positive mind share than it deserves. Just like hinting, which was all the rage a few years ago, but is no longer fashionable&hellip;</i> <BR> <BR>If I thought this stuff was to do with fashion or consumerist vitality, I wouldn't be very interested in it. Background technologies in font manufacture or raster imaging are not driven by consumer trends: they're driven by the need to achieve goals efficiently. Even if one demonstrated that hand-tuned greyscale bitmaps were the best thing going in terms of readability &ndash; even ignoring the spacing defects they share with b/w bitmaps &ndash;, no one is going to sit down and make a range of sizes of them for a family of 3000+ glyph fonts. TrueType hinting for b/w rendering was developed because manually making bitmaps is too labour-intensive; manually making hand-tuned greyscale bitmaps is that much more labour-intensive. It simply isn't feasible as a model for producing all the fonts that the users of the world's many languages need. ClearType rendering further reduces the font production overhead by substantially simplifying the kind of hinting that is required. So from a font developer perspective, ClearType rendering is part of a continuing effort to make the production of readable type for screen less labour-intensive. [Which is not to say that this is the impetus behind the development of the technology: the MS Advanced Reading Technologies team are not primarily involved in font development.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Yes, but you can have both.</i> <BR> <BR>No, actually, you can't. The improved spacing is specifically a function of allowing widths to align to subpixels rather than to whole pixels. This means that the stem of a letter may begin to be rendered on either a red, green or blue subpixel, and that will not be consistent because it is determined by allowing the widths to fall where they will on the subpixels. If you want totally consistent glyph rendering, then you have to space to whole pixels. This is the biggest single problem in b/w and traditional anti-aliasing (including the current generation of CT rendering, which does not use subpixel positioning): the smaller the type, the worse the spacing becomes because of the crudity of the full pixel grid. <BR> <BR>In the graphic below, I've used what I call a diagramatic display to compare the spacing and rendering of type without subpixel positioning (top) and with subpixel positioning (below). It's diagramatic because I'm not showing the actual sub-pixels, only the cumulative affect on full pixel colour, which makes it easier to see the variant rendering and spacing. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52657.gif" alt="Subpixel positioning comparison"> <BR> <BR> <BR>If you think that superhinting is more labour intensive than making bitmaps, then you simply do not know what you are talking about. Why don't you talk to Sampo Kaasila about <i>why</i> the TrueType hinting model was developed? Or to people who have worked &ndash; in manufacturing conditions with deadlines and costs &ndash; on both bitmap making and TT hinting. Laurence Penney, who knows a lot more about TT hinting than either of us, defines TT hinting a method for the efficient creation of bitmaps. Yes, applying deltas to turn on an off individual bits is labour intensive, but the point is that this is something that only needed to be done after 95% of the hinting was complete and you already had largely correct bitmaps at a greater range of sizes than you could ever hope to obtain manually. <BR> <BR>Hrant, if you want to spend your time making handtuned greyscale bitmaps, I'm the last person who will say you should not. But I wonder if you will ever ship anything other than illustrations to Typophile discussions? I think this is simply a practical issue, and I don't see the benefit as in any way justifying the costs, not when one considers relative impact of devoting one's time to other things, e.g. some good Armenian text faces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the <a href="http://www.artofcode.com/fontfocus/">FontFocus</a> website to which Raph directed us, I'm particularly struck by the image comparing FontFocus with ClearType, near the bottom of the page. It isn't a very fair comparison, because as Si has noted there are spacing problems that are the result of Word and not of ClearType; also the text size chosen in all the FontFocus examples is below normal reading size, and presumably this shows the rendering to advantage. But the real kicker is that, apart from the spacing problems, <i>the ClearType rendering is better.</i> The FontFocus has a nice even typographic colour, but that colour is a pale gray. Try actually reading the two passages, and you get a really good empirical understanding of the importance of high contrast to readability. To use Hrant's terminology, the ClearType rendering has better notan. The comparison of FontFocus with ClearType is a good example of the difference between making on-screen type <i>look nice</i> and making it <i>readable.</i> <BR> <BR>As John Berry quipped in one of his recent CreativePro articles, there is a reason why printing was known as 'the black art' and not 'the grey art'. One of the few things on which legibility studies to date provide really conclusive evidence is the importance of high contrast; of course, it is also one of the easier things to test.</div>

I'm not even going to pursue that line of discussion any further, because obviously it will just end in a spitting match. I continue to be interested in conversation, so instead I'll follow this line of thought: <BR> <BR>I'm not denying that there are circumstances in which handtuned greyscale bitmaps might be useful. However, I don't find the Mana example you showed above anything like as readable as the CT text that surrounds it in my browser: like all bitmap fonts it suffers from the fact that the effective stem weight must be either one or two pixels, while the CT text can render to between one and two pixels, which is where you actually want it for typical text sizes on a 146ppi screen. Of course, you must also take into account that the pixels on my screen are very small, which means that your Mana single-pixel stem weight is <i>really light</i> for me: much too light and sparkly to be easily readable. Like specifying type in pixel sizes in CSS, using size-specific bitmap fonts fails to keep pace with varying screen resolutions. This is why I think the circumstances in which bitmap fonts continue to be useful are all device-specific, e.g. embedded fonts in mobile phones. If you live in a world in which you know the resolution of the output device then yes, you can design effective bitmap fonts for reading. But most of the text we read on screen does not exist in such a world: we don't know the resolution of the output devices for which we are making fonts and rendering systems, which is why a flexible, scaleable technology is much more desirable than bitmaps, however good. Of course, you could decide to inhabit forever the Steve Jobs world of 72ppi, but I'd rather not.</div>

Compare, for example, Verdana with the closely related Meiryo Latin in the <i>Now Read This</i> book. Verdana was designed around bitmaps, and the proportions of letters and spacing are determined by the bitmap grids. It is a great typeface for its purpose and original target rendering technology, but Meiryo is a better typeface with better proportions and spacing. As Matthew notes in the text, this is precisely because he was no longer constrained by having to draw around pixels, because the ClearType rendering allows much more subtlty in the proportions and spacing. <BR> <BR>I notice that your Mana is quite condensed: well, in bitmap fonts you have to make a choice at some sizes between too narrow or too wide, and you probably made the right choice.</div>

The best you could do is create colour bitmaps like the g on the left below, which would mimic the impact of ClearType on the colour density of full pixels, but this is quite different from what ClearType actually does, which is to rasterise to actual sub-pixels (as shown in the g on the right). <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52682.gif" alt="Colour bitmap vs. ClearType"> <BR> <BR>As you can see, there is still an overall reduction in contrast in the colour bitmap vs. the ClearType, and I don't see how this could be addressed in manual editing without making the letter bolder: the reduction of a horizontal grid of e.g. nine subpixels to three full pixels simply reduces the rendering options.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All: thanks for the feedback. My goal in making the FontFocus <a href="http://artofcode.com/fontfocus/compare.html">samples</a> (link is to more extensive comparison, btw) was to make the renderings consistent in all respects other than underlying font technology. So, among other things, they're all tuned to be as closed to WYSIWYG as the platform allows. I'm not going to argue that Times at 11ppem with default spacing is in any way optimum for readability, aesthetics, or what have you. In particular, it's easy to believe that just about anything that makes the text heavier is an improvement. I'm greatly reminded of the problems of trying to compare photo image quality when the color profiles are not carefully matched; most people will choose the better color rendition no matter what other artifacts are present. <BR> <BR>It would be <i>most</i> fascinating to see what would happen if a good type designer were to design fonts for optimum screen reading with FF. I am a type designer of middling competence, but maybe I should get busy :<a href="http://www.artofcode.com/"></a>) <BR> <BR>Hrant: it turns out you can shift subpixel rendered graphics by exact 1/3 pixel increments with almost no change in quality. For a great many applications, 1/3px is Good Enough</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>As a font, sure, but you could always make images with text formed with any color pixels you want.</i> <BR> <BR>You are missing my point, Hrant. I am not debating whether you can colour pixels however you want; I'm pointing out that you cannot colour individual <i>subpixels.</i> What you see in the diagramtic images I post showing coloured full pixels is an <i>approximation</i> of the impact of ClearType on pixel colour, which is a useful way of showing some things, but it does not represent the actual resolution benefit of ClearType, which is only apparent if you look at the actual subpixels. Note, for example the righthand, outer edge of the upper bowl in my image of the two g's, above. In the left g, you can see that the approximation of the colour impact on the full pixel is a pale blue. But if you look at the actual subpixel rendering you'll see that only two of the three subpixels that make up that pixel &ndash; the red and the green subpixel &ndash; are actually turned on by in the supersampled outline. So if you try to mimic or improve on this by colouring full pixels, you are going to affect the weight of the letter, usually by making it heavier.</div>

Someone would need to a) define a colour-bitmap font format (can PhotoFonts do this, I wonder? I've just never seen any PhotoFonts designed for size specific bitmap text), and b) make a colour-bitmap font editing tool that makes it graphically easy to address the individual colour channels. Without the latter, I think you would go mad trying to make a single font. <BR> <BR>So are we talking conceptually, here, or are you actually going to do this? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>
