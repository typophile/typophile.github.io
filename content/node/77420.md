  looking at the f and can't find a match. Maybe I'm wrong assuming it's Caslon?"

  body: "Thank you akira! \r\n\r\nAnd if I were to look for a good alternative to
    Lexicon no. 2 (and at that price, I have little choice), what would you guys suggest?
    It would be nice if it's a font good for setting long texts, and it would be nice
    if it works well printed out on a 300 dpi printer. And I will combine it with
    Schwartz' Graphik.\r\n\r\nSo, help me understand myself: When I'm attracted to
    Caslon and Lexicon no. 2, what should I look for in other fonts? What is the typical
    features of those two? They do compare, right? \r\n\r\nI also like [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/miller/|Miller,]]
    which I find to be somehow similar."
