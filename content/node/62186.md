  of the Futura family, but I guess I was wrong. Anybody think they can help me on
  this one? Thanks in advance! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/vinci_5913.jpg]

  body: Wow, been here for a little over three days and getting snippy with a great
    contributor like Jan. I was going to post the exact name of this font but I'm
    really having second thoughts. It was so easy to find.
