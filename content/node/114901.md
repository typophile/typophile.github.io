  Kanpur, India. I am in my second year and doing thesis on \"emotions in typefaces\".
  For my thesis I need opinions about typefaces which were put on the movie posters
  to study context and typeface together. I have made a online questionnaire. It will
  take only 15 minutes. If you could help me, Kindly reply to this email Id- sonikagondval@gmail.com
