body: Maybe some of you would like to get started with Dreamweaver. <BR>I&#39;m selling
  my license, now that I figured out how to transfer it properly. It&#39;s the recent
  version btw. I&#39;m selling it a bit cheaper than Macromedia is currently, since
  bits don&#39;t suffer from wear and tear I think that&#39;s fair game. <BR> <BR><a

  <BR> <BR>Also I&#39;d like to get rid of Contribute 2 and Adobe&#39;s GoLive 6 which
  I accidently over-licensed <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> No really, since I got GoLive 6.0 as a box and CS Premium
  as a box I don&#39;t need to have a dead license lying around.

    which is a sad but true story to read. <BR> <BR>But as you can see here it&#39;s
    perfectly fine with Macromedia to transfer a license. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/service/ts/documents/transfer_owner.htm"

    <BR> <BR>Adobe also has a good policy on the transfer of software licenses. <a

    <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t consider selling it if it would be illegal to do so!'
