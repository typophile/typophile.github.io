body: "I hope somebody can help me. I once found a brilliant quote of Gunnlaugur S.E.
  Briem online which I used in a Dutch language presentation. I translated it to Dutch
  for that presentation but didn't keep the original. Now I need this quote for an
  article I'm writing for PSD Magazine and can't find the original English version.
  Judging from my translation I can assume it should go something like this:\r\n\r\n<cite>Some
  people profess that letters solely exist to be read and that's why any factor that
  influences their legibility should be avoided. This is akin saying that the only
  purpose of alcoholic beverages is to get drunk.</cite>\r\n\r\nNow this sounds like
  crap and I'd like to cite Briem correctly, so I would be very grateful if somebody
  could point me to the original quote. Many thanks."

    that the purpose of liquor is to get you drunk. If it were right, people would
    swig metal polish, and the farmers of Cognac, Burgundy, and Champagne grow potatoes.)</em>
