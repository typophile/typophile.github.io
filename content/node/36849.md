  it is called Uffda but I have no idea where to find it. This is from the non-format
  studio's recent work. There is also another grid-based block typeface called Roeg
  which i'm pretty sure the studio uses a lot. I've been looking for both but have
  not found anything.\r\n\r\nThanks and I hope I posted this correctly.\r\n"

  body: Nonformat designs are a recurring pain in the butt because they seem to use
    heavily customised or even entirely custom designed typefaces.

  body: "Gotcha. :)\r\n\r\nI always thought that they were super customized based
    on typefaces like Futura and AvantGarde, but when my friend showed me their profile
    book that was recently released, they actually were listed down as fonts with
    names. Very confusing.\r\n\r\nthanks again!"
