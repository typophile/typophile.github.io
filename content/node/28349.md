  things happening with Linotype Palatino bold when they export to PDF? mine loses
  the word spacing in unexpected places , let's say in a contents page there will
  be four words that have lost the spaces before them, every time I export to PDF,
  I have to make sure that Palatino bold is safely outlined otherwise this always
  happens. Thank God I don't use it in any large quantities.\r\n\r\n--N"
