  body: "I think we do get value from Kerning onscreen when we use ClearType, particularly
    when we render with sub-pixel positioning. Actually this was the original design
    intent for the ClearType fonts. I have some experience in this, as we included
    some device kerning in Palatino Linotype for onscreen black and white rendering.
    In the monochrome world the value of Kerning onscreen for normal text sizes was
    less obvious. You might get away with a To kern for instance, but lowercase kern
    pairs were problematic, as you have to move 1 whole pixel to kern the letter pair,
    which is often way too much. In ClearType we have greater accuracy when placing
    the glyphs onscreen, and so the adjustment of the Kern value, is less than a pixel,
    which although not optimal still adds value in my opinion. Have a look at the
    enclosed screen shot, the font is Constantia, designed by John Hudson, at 10,
    12, 14 point. We can of course debate the details, and some will say yes but it\u2019s
    not perfect, on the other hand I see more value having the kerning working, than
    not.\r\n\r\nThe current plan with regard to the CT fonts is to ship with OpenType
    Kerning tables only\r\n\r\nmike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CTKern.gif]"

  body: "In both OT PS (.otf) and OT TT (.ttf) there can be two kinds of kerning:
    OpenType \"kern feature\" kerning (which may employ classes or and/or plain pairs)
    and old-style \"kern table\" kerning (which only uses plain pairs). However, the
    relation between the types of kerning differs between the PS/TT flavors.\r\n\r\nPrincipally,
    new-style OpenType Layout-aware applications (Adobe CS, Windows Vista WPF, Mellel
    etc.) use the OpenType \"kern feature\" kerning only in both flavors. If a font
    is an OT TT font and the old-style \"kern table\" is present, then old-style OpenType
    Layout-non-aware applications (Word, Quark, Flash etc.) will show the kerning
    specified in the table but if the old-style \"kern table\" is not present in the
    font, there will be no kerning. If a font is OT PS and the old-style \"kern table\"
    is present, old-style applications will show the kerning in the table, but --
    and here is the difference -- if the old-style \"kern table\" is not present,
    the Adobe font driver (ATM, Windows 2000/XP built-in, Mac OS X built-in) will
    automatically convert the Western subset of the OpenType kerning into old-style
    kerning on the fly, so you will always get kerning for Western characters.\r\n\r\nIn
    FontLab Studio 5, you can explicitly decide (in Options / Generating OpenType
    & TrueType / Kerning) whether the font (either OT PS or OT TT) should or should
    not contain the OpenType \"kern feature\" and/or the old-style \"kern table\".
    In FontLab 4.6, OT PS fonts will never contain the \"kern table\" while OT TT
    fonts will always contain it. \r\n\r\nAdam"

    who wants to make kerning pairs for ClearType Fonts, (assuming that ClearType
    is in fact for the screen as I used to be sure of), the kerns should be \"grouped\"
    in value, (the same way stems, heights, counters and all the other features of
    well bred screen fonts are, lacking in minute details so that nothing leaves the
    rounding rails ;)), Then when the kern pairs are rounded out of your control,
    kerning will not \"fall apart\" in the process and diminish the spacing quality
    further. This, e.g. would mean that if you have To=-28, Ta=-32, Tw=-36 and T\u0131=-14,
    Tu=-18 and Tw=-20, the first three'd be better at -32, and the last three'd be
    better at -16, CLEAR!?)\r\n\r\nAND HEY! Don't you dare forget the \"rT\" kerning

  body: "I missed this thread when it started, so will just add a few belated notes
    on the kerning in the ClearType collection because it was sort of interesting.
    As Si and Mike note, the fonts all contain OpenType Layout GPOS kern feature kerning,
    rather than a 'kern' table. At one stage, we considered including both, the latter
    with a subset of kern pairs for the benefit of applications that don't handle
    GPOS kerning, but Luc de Groot reported various bugs he'd found in software encountering
    fonts with both the GPOS and old kern table kerning, so we have not pursued this
    option.\r\n\r\nThe OTL tables for all fonts were written using VOLT, not FontLab,
    for a couple of reasons. Firstly, all the fonts contain lookup types not supported
    by the FDK/FontLab code. Secondly, Microsoft wanted VOLT files for source management.\r\n\r\nWhen
    we began the project, I had already made some fonts using VOLT, and was concerned
    that it is far from an ideal tool for developing kerning data. There is no way
    to preview strings of more than two glyphs in the pair adjustment GPOS user interface.
    So Paul Linnerud from the Advanced Reading Technologies team and I designed a
    process to convert kern pair data from an AFM file into VOLT lookup syntax. This
    would enable the designers to do their kerning in FontLab (or FontStudio in Luc's
    case), and then convert to VOLT source data. At the same time as Paul and I were
    working on this, I mentioned to Sergey Malkin at MS Typography that we were looking
    for a kerning converter. To my surprise and joy, Sergey very quickly delivered
    a small tool, kern2volt, which was much simpler than the complex syntax conversion
    I was working on with Paul and produced a smaller, more effiecient lookup. The
    kern2volt tool examines a kern table and produces an efficient GPOS lookup with
    classes based on shared values. In the end, we used this tool for all the ClearType
    fonts. It is now available for download from the VOLT user community on MSN.\r\n\r\nDuring
    this process, Luc and his associates in Berlin were busy working on their own
    kerning conversion method, which took a third approach involving writing VOLT
    glyph groups to match FontLab kern classes and then writing corresponding kern
    lookups. We used Luc's VOLT kern sources made in this way for the early test versions
    of his Calibri fonts, but discovered a bug in the TT rasteriser in the earlier
    versions of InDesign that caused the font not to render correctly. This was already
    fixed in the more recent versions of InDesign, but we decided to convert Luc's
    kerning data using the same kern2volt procedure as we had the other fonts in the
    collection."
