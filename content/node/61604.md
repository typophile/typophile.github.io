  ear.  \r\n\r\nMission complete, the smaller of two, hundred year old engraving proofing
  presses have just been fully restored and completely operable by my husband and
  partner, John Mack Collins.  This baby (pictured above) weighs-in at about two hundred
  pounds and when you hit the ball watch your head and digits 'cause it wields about
  a force of two tons.\r\n\r\nThese presses were originally made for proofing half
  inch thick commercially engraved dies but they have been used for production work
  on embossed monograms and family seals.  The big brother, about 50% again the weight,
  is almost completely restored as well.  This one will reside at Loyola University
  New Orleans in the graphic design department with Professors Daniela Marx and Nancy
  Bernardo.  A small but burgeoning cottage industry for print engraving is being
  nurtured here in New Orleans by Yvette Rutlidge, venerable typographer, sign letter
  and master engraver, http://www.angelfire.com/planet/mysticbluesigns/engraving.html.
  \ Yve will be devoting a portion of her shop to the letter arts, and, engraving.\r\n\r\nFollow
