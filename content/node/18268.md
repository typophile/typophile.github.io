  body: "Funny... I just traded the game in  last week.\r\nI'm also trying to contact
    game developers to see if they might be interested in coming to or even participating
    in TypeCon 2006. I think it's an industry that doing more custom screen fonts
    than many standard foundries nowadays."

    you have inside knowledge.\r\n\r\nPity about the prime marks instead of apostrophes!
    Hate seeing that."

  body: "I really think it is Georgia. They have extended The stem of the P,R,M below
    the beaseline. They added the decorative serifs to the middle of the stems. I
    can't find one letter that doesn't match up. Stephen, your suggestions get the
    same look as the font they are looking for, but I strongly feel that they used
    Georgia then added the spurs (I don't know the right term).\r\n\r\nAlso, Georgia
    is a font used in low resolution situations. That's one of the reasons I went
    straight to it."

  body: Ahah. I got you know. Very clever ID. There's a good chance also that this
    is a free font that started out as Georgia (naughty naughty).

    having to customize it?
