body: Traditional Arabic fonts have stems and curves going all over the place, compared
  to Latin, where verticals and horizontals dominate.  Hinting Latin - I think - relies
  on such uniformity, but what about Arabic?  Will an Arabic font benefit from hinting?  My
  font has outlines of identical thickness - does this help the hinting process?  Any
  hints (!) suggestions and examples most welcome as I know very little in practice
  about this.

    weight, consistency of visual features, and maintaining counters and apertures
    &c. If you like, I\u2019d be happy to make a small test for you."

  body: If you want to hint the font using type 1 hinting it's pretty simple. You
    just have to follow the rules like latin, connect parallel horizontal nodes to
    each other and the same for the vertical ones. For dots just restrict multiple
    dots between two horizontal stems and vertical stems. Finally put one horizontal
    link at the descender and one at the ascender. TrueType hinting for an arabic
    typeface could be a headache. I don't know about that. Titus  knows much more
    about this since hid did TrueType hinting on Nassim typeface which is being used
    on BBC Persian website.

    body: Thank you Bahman the type 1 sounds straightforward.  Yes Titus did a nice
      webfont for BBC Arabic and Persian service he is quite an expert on Arabic fonts,
      their history etc.
