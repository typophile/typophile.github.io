  favorite of all type families\u2014I came across a comment on [[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/choice.html|this
  website]], claiming Abrams' \"Augereau\" to be \"the most authentic digitization\"
  of Garamond's original punches. I started drooling over Augereau, which is really
  beautiful, but found that it doesn't look very authentic. Somebody on these forums
  pointed out the capital R is more heavily stylized than the original; I discovered
  that the arms of the capital W don't cross. What gives?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there
  seems to be conflicting information on the web about the various Garamonds\u2014not
  even including the Jannon misattributes. Some say Stempel is the most authentic,
  while others claim this or that feature is too short, too curved, or just plain
  different. Bitstream renamed all their Garamonds, and Adobe offers two.\r\n\r\nI'm
  just now getting heavily into typography (I'm coming over from the world of music
  engraving) and the only Garamond I have any concrete opinion about is the actual
  original. Before I fork over the cash for Augereau\u2014or any other Garamond\u2014can
  anybody advise me on its authenticity, or the authenticity of any of these in general?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\u2014Bram"

  body: "There's not much authenticity in digitizing punches.\r\nIMO an authentic
    copy font should be able to create a facsimile page that is indistinguishable
    from the original.\r\nThat's difficult, unless you're printing letterpress on
    100% rag stock.\r\n\r\nBy any other measure, there will be questions about what
    is \"authentic\" -- letter shapes, which size is being used as a model, how much
    distress is being applied, whether the punch or the printed page tells the truth,
    how much accommodation/modification should be made for present day demands, &c.,
    &c,"

    Less with Monotype than during Garamond's day, and less still in offset litho,
    but still worth considering.\r\n\r\n(Of course, no Garamond printed on coated
    paper, or offset, could ever be considered authentic!)\r\n"

  body: "@ William\r\n\r\nYou are much more competent on that field. But when I compare
    Merlo and Stempel Garamond, I see more similarities than differences, except from
    the different stroke width and contrast. The feeling, that I have, when I see
    these typefaces, is similar, more than in the comparison of Sabon and Stempel
    Garamond, which is often called a Garamond, isn\u2019t it? But I wouldn\u2019t
    exclude, that I see the similarity, because I simply like both typefaces very
    much. They are in the top ten of my favorites. And Merlo is intended to be used
    in another point size than the digitized Stempel Garamond. Stempel Garamond is
    more agile or less even with regard to the single glyphs, but this does not disturb
    the legibility, because the glyphs are in harmony. I wish there would be optical
    sizes for both typefaces. For using them in the same document, they are too different.\r\n\r\nAnother
    word to Augerau: The plain metrics and the kerning are a desaster, especially
    the kerning, as far as I remember. (Much worse than in Stempel Garamond, which
    already is not well spaced and kerned.)"

  body: "Arno: <em>Augereau is probably more the punch than the print.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    think Augereau is more Abrams than (Garamond) punch or print.\r\n\r\nI had the
    pleasure of meeting Mr Abrams at an ATypI congress, and I have a copy of the nice
    specimen book of his \u2018Jenson revival\u2019, Abram Venetian. It has been a
    long time since I looked at his Augereau, but I don't doubt that it represents
    his ideas about the 16th Century French style just as his Jenson represents his
    ideas about the 15th Century Venetian style.\r\n\r\nThere's a long history of
    new type designs being passed off or advertised as \u2018the most authentic revival\u2019.
    My favourite example is the 1924 Caslon Foundry complete recutting being sold
    as \u2018struck from the original 18th Century punches\u2019. It's advertising,
    which is another way of saying bullsh\u0456t."

    it's just false.\r\nHowever, claiming that, for instance, a large x-height (or
    a small one) improves legibility, <strong>is</strong> bullshit, because it is
    neither true nor false.\r\nThen again, there is advertising which is true, and
    not bullshit but genuinely informative -- such as the present Font Bureau banner
    ad at Typophile which states that Ibis has 48 styles and is designed by Cyrus
    Highsmith."
