  body: Obviously there are not that many Ikarus users amongst the Typophile attendees
    &#40;anymore&#41;. Ikarus was developed by Dr. Peter Karow in the early 1970s
    and was for a long time the de facto program for professional font production.
    In time versions of Ikarus were developed by URW in Hamburg for all kinds of operating
    systems, including Solaris, Sun OS, DOS and Mac OS. The versions for DOS &#40;Ikarus
    B/D&#41; and Mac OS &#40;Ikarus M&#41; were more or less stripped end user editions
    which lacked most of the enhanced batch functionality of the &#39;bigger&#39;
    Ikarus systems running under Unix.  <BR> <BR>The Ikarus algorithm has been developed
    for the conversion of analog material to digital descriptions. In the Ikarus system
    all points are placed on the contour, which for instance is not the case with

  body: In the preliminary drawing for the roman of DTL Fell two lines are used to
    indicate the thickness of horizontal serifs. The third line is a guideline for
    the overshoot but not more than that. The curves of the h, m and n do not touch
    the overshoot for the more rounded letters like the o. I would like to underline
    here that this is a very early drawing from a small series that was used by several
    people at DTL to make more definite versions. Basically the work on the typeface
    has almost been finished now; the character sets are complete but we still have
    to do some fine tuning here and there, especially the spacing needs some extra
    attention. I have included here a low res illustration to give you some idea of
    the work we have been doing since 1997.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/22173.gif"

  body: "<em>A little</em> IKARUS <em>trivia</em> \r\n\r\n-- IKARUS is (and has always
    been) spelled in all caps by URW, and to my knowledge is neither an acronym nor
    an initialism of any expression.\r\n\r\n-- Ever since I was introduced (1981)
    to the IKARUS System, I personally took issue with the name and foolishly argued
    the point with Dr. Peter Karow and Peter Rosenfeld. (Yes, I was, and forever will
    be foolish.) <a href=\"http://www.loggia.com/myth/daedalus.html\" target=\"new\"><em>My
    argument</em></a> was that in Greek mythology, Icarus was the foolish son of Daedalus,
    who once given mechanical wings by his father, ignored the warning of flying to
    close to the sun, and thereby fell to his death. Not a great person to name anything
    after, as Daedalus was the smart innovator and Icarus was the fool.\r\n\r\n--
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/marconi/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Marconi</strong></a>,
    designed by Hermann in 1976, was the first type family developed for typesetting
    by the IKARUS System.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marconi-Zapf-URW.png]\r\n\r\n--
    Because of this topic thread, I reopened my copy of Dr. Karow's book, <em>Digital
    Formats for Typefaces</em> (1987), and rediscovered several interesting visual
    excersises and references that would still be viable for graphic design students
    (<em>clothoids</em>, circle/square/triangle visual perception survey, etc.).\r\n"

  body: "> there are sometimes 11 lines around the x-ht.\r\n\r\nSounds juicy. I only
    use like four or something, and (so?) I don't\r\neven mark them, preferring to
    keep them in my head (and they\r\ncan always be \"looked up\" if needed).\r\n\r\nSo
    what are some \"non-obvious\" lines/marks?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "For those interested still in the Ikarus format, it might be interesting
    to know that a new edition (2.5) of DTL FontMaster will be released soon. IkarusMaster
    (like BezierMaster) includes several new options, including the possibility to
    import and export fonts directly. This functionality is the same as in DataMaster,
    but only for one font at the time instead of batching like in DM. \r\nProgramming
    has been finished recently and currently I am working on the update of the supporting
    files (Character Layout, Features, Kern[class], et cetera).\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5
    of DTL FontMaster will be the last released also for Classic besides Windows.
    Later in 2006 the first range of FM batch modules for OS X will be made available.\r\n"
