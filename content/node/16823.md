  \"no input signal\" on its screen and its broken connector in my hands. I cannot
  imagine how come in my always empty room the two pins of the connector got *that*
  much... literally severly bent... but this is what it is.\r\n\r\nSo after a night
  full of grief and sorrow, I have decided there might be a new monitor coming my
  way (it wasn't planned, no, I need money elsewhere). And I even got this shallow
  to think of an LCD replacement.\r\n\r\nI am currently looking at BenQ, Iiyama, EIZO
  (though more with envy than with intent) and, ahem, Sony. I am looking at this forum
  through Iiyama 19\" CRT screen and should confess, it seems to be a pretty good
  fella. But it's way too big for my coffee table. :/ So, yes, it should be an LCD.\r\n\r\nOh,
  no, I am not mistinterpreting this forum \u2014 exactly your perspective on the
  question has importance to me, not the CNet/ZDNet clique.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"

  body: "We have Apple flat panel displays, Samsung flat panels and 2 Dell flat panels
    here and having tried them all, I have to say the Apple screen is hands down the
    best I've ever used. (Sony Trinitron CRTs look blurry by comparison). Samsung
    and Dell's are both bright and good quality (I prefer Samsung over Dell), but
    you don't get the same crispness as the Apple display, especially with on screen
    reading, where it matters most. The Dell 21\" has an LG screen inside, just like
    Apple's 20\" product and it's funny how the picture is just not as clean as it
    is on the Apple display. The Dell form factor is pretty ugly, by comparison.\r\n"

    Apple Cinema Display better? \r\n\r\nThe marketing people from Apple surely are
    convincing, a pity that the technology doesn't support that. \r\n\r\nThe 24-inch
    Dell UltraSharp 2405FPW LCD comes with 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast,
    12 ms response time, and a 3-year warranty at $900 (5-year warranty at $940).
    \r\n\r\nThe 23-inch Apple Cinema HD Display M9178LL/A LCD comes with 270 cd/m2
    brightness, 400:1 contrast, 16 ms response time, and a 1-year warranty at $1,300.
    \r\n\r\nBoth have the same 1920 x 1200 native resolution, the same viewing angle.
    The Apple monitor is thinner and lighter (but it's also 1\" smaller), and it comes
    with Firewire that Dell doesn't. \r\n\r\nThe Dell is 30% faster, 85% brighter,
    has 150% more contrast and is 30% cheaper than the Apple monitor. But it doesn't
    come with a picture of Steve Jobs in the box. If you only work at nights or with
    completely closed curtains, get the Apple, otherwise get the Dell, because that
    actually is up-to-date technology. \r\n\r\nOf course, instead of the Dell, you
    can also choose the 24-inch Samsung 244T, which offers 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1
    contrast and an unbelievable 8 ms response time (that's twice as fast as grandpa
    Apple), and costs about the same as the Apple. But it also doesn't come with a
    picture of Steve Jobs in the box. \r\n\r\nPick a monitor from one of the companies
    that understand how to manufacture LCD panels: Samsung, Dell or Eizo. Forget cheap
    knockoffs like BenQ or Iiyama. And forget Apple Cinema Display, which represents
    the state of LCD technology from three years ago. \r\n\r\nA."

    a second screen for home. But then again, I can't spare the cash right now.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "You still haven't explained why the pixels don't appear the same to my eyes...
    Is it because it's not DVI?\r\n\r\nWe selected the Apple and Samsung displays
    because we can lease Mac and PC gear from one source without creating a separate
    lease agreement with Dell. That said, I still don't see the difference you're
    talking about with the Dell 21\" vs. the Apple 23\". The specs I read at time
    of purchase suggested the Apple 23\" and Dell 21\" had the same LG hardware inside.
    But I'm not going to dig up the specs now... I'll leave that for Adam. =)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    the Dell 24\" is special, but I can't get past the crappy black plastic hardware
    and wonky (big) foot piece. Honestly, talk about being years behind in the industrial
    design department."

    It makes me think of \"Lexus vs BMW\" or \"Ducati vs Yamaha\" comparisons. Any
    of those options, though, are a bit out of my budget. Neither 23\" Apple nor 24\"
    Dell are coming my way this time. It's 19\" up to 350 (okay, okay... 375) euros.
    Thus all >20 LCDs are being left out.\r\nDell is good? I've never had an impression
    Dell was something quality-like. Hm. NEC, maybe?\r\n\r\nThanks for the input(signal).\r\n\r\nps.
