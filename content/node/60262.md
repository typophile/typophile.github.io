  around with this little sans project - reminds me like kinda typewriter style with
  those slightly broadening, curly terminals. \r\n\r\nNo boning effect was removed
  yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it? Do you like it/hate it? Is it boring or not
  so?\r\n\r\nThanks for your comment and critique in advance!\r\n\r\nfab[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unalom_sketces_03_all_4895.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks mk2!\r\n\r\nActually you're right - the project wasn't supposed to
    be set in extremely small size. \r\nHowever, first print test shows it is quite
    legible set is as small as 6-8 point.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn update: more complete character
    set, some test (you could check pdf).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fabergraph.hu/faberfonts/specimen/unalom_specimen_01.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould
    be nice to have some c&c. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen_01_small_4202.jpg]"

  body: "It'd make a nice magazine cover typeface I think. I wouldn't bother so much
    about not being legible at small sizes. You might want to make it look amazing
    really big. The roundish, dropish terminal lends itself well for that.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as shapes go, I'd check on the shapes of lowercase A, F (maybe the terminal
    not so geometrical half circle), R (same as f), S (s being the one I enjoyed the
    least - pretty hard to get right - spine might not make such steep directional
    change). Observe what you did with J lowercase, I think r, f should match that,
    looks good.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of uppercase B seems a little too far to the
    left.\r\nIn the numbers, you may try to review 7, for one without the bar on the
    center.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nRodrigo Saiani"
