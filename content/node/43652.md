  body: "No idea what the problem is. I keep trying but it's not loading up, even
    though it appears as though it is. I've had this problem multiple times.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I learned that FF didn't like my attempt. So I just opened IE6 and that allowed
    me to do so. I tried FF again just to make sure I wasn't dreaming - but still
    no dice."
