  (32 pages) which is being printed on bond extra white paper. The thing is that the
  pictures came out slightly \"muddy\", a bit dark, fussy and wased out.\r\n\r\nWhat
  kind of adjustments would you suggest to improve the appearance of these photos?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "The images are probably printing muddy because you are not using a coated
    paper and the ink is bleeding, which results in excessive dot gain.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's being printed litho with a halftone screen then maybe try lowering the screen
    ruling to an lpi (lines per inch) something closer to what newspapers would use.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone\r\n\r\nYou
    could try printing a CMYK image with a very low screen ruling for a groovy Roy
    Lichtenstein style effect :)"

    amount of ink that is used to print them by using Gray Component Replacement or
    Under Colour Removal in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nMenu > Edit > Color Settings > Working

  body: "I would surmise that, if you are printing on bond paper, you are NOT printing
    CMYK, but single-color photos, which is another kettle of fish entirely. However,
    the diagnosis of the problem as dot gain is correct. In order to reproduce the
    photos better, you will need to flatten the tonal range somewhat, especially in
    the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to accomplish this in Photoshop is to create
    a new layer and flood it with white, then set the blending options to Screen.
    At this point, you will need to generate some test photos to see which percentage
    of layer opacity yields the best results. Start with a setting of 10%, flatten
    the image, and save it under a unique name (e.g., test_10pct.tif); undo the flattening,then
    try 15%, 20% and 25%, saving each one. The example below shows the original phot
    on the left, and a 10% white overlay on the right. Assemble and label your test
    photos on a single page in Quark or InDesign, label them with their titles, and
    have the sample page printed on the same paper you will use for the final product.
    If you find that one photo is a little too dark and the next step is a little
    too light, choose an intermediate value, and use it in production. The chosen
    value may not work optimally in all situations, but the results should be better
    than doing nothing at all.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dot_gain_4081.jpg]"

  body: If this is one-color your darkest black should proabably be around 90%, or
    maybe even 87% to compensate for dot gain. Use curves in photoshop to do this.
    You will also need to open up the midtones, (less ink) and probably boost the
    contrast a bit. Ask your printer for some help on this. They may be able to provide
    some specific ink levels for you to work with.

  body: "Good advice, thanks, I'm going to study the methods proposed and I surely
    have to ask how much ink can our paper take. We are currently printing at 150
    lpi.\r\n\r\nWhat are quarter tones?\r\n\r\nThis small magazine is being printed
    CMYK and we want to have vibrant colors and crisp photos because it's a touristic
    promotion tool.\r\n\r\nThe reason for switching to bond is to get a warm tactile
    feeling but also there is a trend to print magazines in bond or uncoated papers
    and we want to look edgy... you know.\r\n\r\nWe are considering to use domtar
    titanium paper instead of bond, this may reduce dot gain and will also mantain
    the cost of the magazine if we print the cover on the same paper of the interiors,
    it's a give away magazine anyway.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "H\xE9ctor, I don't think your objectives are completely at \"cross purposes\".
    I've seen a few groovy, giveaway, uncoated paper, small format magazines with
    the look and feel you're aiming for. One of my favourites is Stranger Mag...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stranger-mag.com/\r\n\r\nYou
    can view the mag online, but obviously you don't get the 'feel' of it. With some
    images they achieve a very nice pencil on paper effect, and the overall feel is
    much more pleasant than large glossy magazines.\r\n\r\nIf you keep the Total Ink
    Limit under 260% and reduce the Screen Ruling (maybe as low as 120lpi) you should
    be able to print 'cleaner' images with a fuller tonal range. Reducing those values
    would also speed up drying time on uncoated paper.\r\n\r\nHowever, finding the
    exact values to get the best results depends upon many things specific to your
    print job. Paper, ink type, press type, press settings, ambient temperature etc.
    etc. can all have an effect on the final image quality.\r\n\r\nGeneral 'rules'
    won't always work. The thing to do is build a good relationship with your printer,
    consider other options they can suggest, keep track of all those variables and
    adjust them until you get the result you're after.\r\n"
