  body: 'Brendel Informatik, I have come to learn, digitized quite a few typefaces
    that are otherwise unavailable digitally. I think that Plakette is a digitization
    of the Permanent typeface family &#40;the g and, especially, the y are quite distinctive&#41;.
    This is Plakette DemiBold: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69878.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Using and stretching this, I was able to duplicate your &#39;panic&#39;
    image. <BR> <BR>Permanent originally came in more than one weight and <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm"
    target="_blank"> Brendel</a> offers Plakette in five. The only other digital version
    of Permenent I&#39;m aware of is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/permanent/"
    target="_blank"> URW&#39;s</a>. Pre-digital Permanent also used to be offered
    in versions with and without descenders. URW&#39;s offering matches Plakette DemiBold,
    except that it is without descenders while Plakette is with descenders. <BR><br>'
