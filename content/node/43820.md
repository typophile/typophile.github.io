  body: Well, you <strong>could</strong> do it in Photoshop; but I wouldn't. Better
    to do it on paper in the first place; than to have your computer mush up your
    letterforms afterwards... Draw a circle lightly on the paper with a pencil, and
    use that as your baseline, when drawing out the calligraphy...

  body: "&emsp;I suppose I'll do that next time.&ensp;For now, though, I was intending
    to warp the image on the computer and then retrace the calligraphy once it's in
    hemicircular form.&ensp;(Then I was planning to go crazy and blow the image up
    by 2\xD7 and edit the fine detail with marker, pen, and white-out\u2026)\r\n&emsp;Also,
    and this is not obvious from the low-res scan I've posted below, I'm using a graph
    paper grid to help me space and position things.&ensp;In order to redraw this
    on a half-circle, I need some sort of circular graph paper with the same spacings
    as what I've built my lettering around.&ensp;And then there's the next line of
    text that I'm intending to put on a bit of a wave.\r\n&emsp;Any suggestions?\r\n\u2014Joel[img:sites/default/files/old-images/od
