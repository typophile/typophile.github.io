  is very unique.  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the font works well
  with Variable (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/) but I am also open
  to sugggestions of other fonts that work well with Variable.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n-Will"

    Beaufort at Shinntype.com and Arrow at Treacyfaces.com. (The latter seems to be

  body: "I would've recommended Berthold's Poppl Laudatio, but it's not a good\r\nmatch
    to Variable - so I might recommend Adobe's Penumbra instead.\r\nIt's geometric
    and has a range of styles from sans to serif, including flare.\r\n\r\nBTW, one
    good thing about Arrow is that it has two italics:\r\none sloped-Roman and one
    more cursive. But it's too 70s.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I doubt that any flare serif would work well with an ultramod font like Variable.
    Flare is just too old school.

  body: "Thanks for your replies.\r\n\r\nWhat would you all suggest for a serif (non-flare)
    font that does work well with Variable?  \r\n\r\nI was thinking of Mediaeval:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/mediaeval/\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    I want the fonts to be able to work together, but I do want some clear differences
    and distinctions.\r\n\r\n-Will"

    the geometric qualities of Variable you could look at a slab serif with a high(ish)
    x-height. How closely do you want the fonts to work, because Variable is fairly
    fine and most serifs will be too heavy to combine in body copy with Variable Regular
    or Bold.\r\nTim"

    for the art pieces, so they will not be used as close together as they would in
    a regular magazine, but should still fit together.\r\n\r\n-Will"

  body: "\"But it\u2019s too 70s.\" Exactly. \r\nIf you really want flares with that,
    you might consider a couple of the old ITC faces - <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sku=ITC9157\">ITC
    Novarese</a> or <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=VCCLSFKKHEKF8JR0GWD408PSKVFU89H4&sku=ITC9136\">ITC
    Newtext</a> are both flared this way, but neither is unique, and the geometry
    of Variable makes this pairing a bit problematic to harmonise. Alternatively,
    if the types are not being used in close proximity on the page, you could go for
    a complete structural contrast in the headlines, captions etc. and try the grandaddy
    of flare serif types - Berthold Wolpe's <a href=\"http://itc.identifont.co.uk/partner?VCCLSFKKHEKF8JR0GWD408PSKVFU89H4+Albertus+255290+010082113\">
    Albertus</a>, which is also available in an italic and a light weight these days.
    \r\nHaving said all that, I much prefer Tim's idea of contrasting Variable with
    an Egyptian or Slabserif."

  body: "You need a serif typeface that isn't mousy and won't bow to the pressure
    of being paired with such a overtly modern typeface. Something quirky on its own,
    I think. What about something from <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/\">Fountain</a>
    such as Stefan Hattenbach's <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/delicato.asp\">Delicato</a>?
    \r\n\r\nSo the faces won't be used on the same page? OR The serif will be text
    and the sans will be head and sub-head?\r\n\r\nI think you will be updating regularly
    if you choose to use such a modern typeface as trends change so quickly. I suppose
    this can be seen as a positive as the art world changes its mind as to what is
    vogue from week to week as well."
