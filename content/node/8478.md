  body: If you&#39;re looking for <a href="http://www.caribou-coffee.com/" target="_blank">this</a>
    logo type it&#39;s not Agency, but I don&#39;t recognize it. <BR> <BR>Sounds like
    the font you&#39;re looking for is in their ads which don&#39;t play on the east
    coast. <BR> <BR>Based on <a href="http://www.boycottwatch.org/caribou/" target="_blank">this</a>
    thread, I&#39;m not gonna be drinking any of their coffee. However, this report
    is 2 years old and they may have changed investors since then. <BR> <BR>Update
    &#40;and I don&#39;t know why I bother since I&#39;ve never even heard of this
    Caribou Coffee&#41; according to <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_caribou_coffee.htm"
    target="_blank">this</a> report the company is still 88% owned by a Muslim bank
    which endorses Shariah. However the anti-Israel sheikh is no longer affiliated
    with the bank.

  body: Thanks everyone, I really appreciate all the help! But what I really need
    is the font for the image that I scanned in of the &#34;Life is Short. Stay away
    for it.&#34; tag line.  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Hmmm... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you provided an image Erin, hence all of
    the guessing. If we have not correctly identified the type maybe you can try reposting
    your sample.

  body: It&#39;s quite possibly a custom font, since hand-printed styles can be done
    as cheaply as free. If it&#39;s a commercial or common freeware font there&#39;s
    a good chance it is shown in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>. Be prepared to search
    through about 25 web pages.

    back in the &#39;90s to promote the ArtParts stock illustration series. Can&#39;t
    put my finger on the name, though...

  body: Aargh! I thought I looked through all of the handwritten samples at FontHaus
    &#40;since they&#39;re the distributor I associate with ArtParts, courtesy of
    a barrage of direct mail in the early &#39;90s&#41;, but I must have missed it.
    <BR> <BR>Nice job, Tiffany &#40;and Mark&#41;.
