  body: The original was a predigital VGC typeface called Ingrid (by Markus J Low,
    I believe). I have Chaucer and I think that it is a copy of the old Fontbank (defunct)
    version of Ingrid, which they called <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/ingenius.htm"
    target="_blank">Ingenius</a> - but with much better letterspacing.

  body: Julio - I'm not finding Chaucer online anywhere for you to download. You might
    have to get Ingenius instead and fix the spacing yourself.
