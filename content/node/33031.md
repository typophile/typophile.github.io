    don\u2019t like linking to Fontshop though, because you can\u2019t link directly
    to the font and the display quality of fonts on the site isn\u2019t all that great.\r\n"

    if i click on a fontshop.com-link (s. coles hyperlinks, normally) \u2013 this
    is not user-friendly, this is rubbish. \r\nBTW. I've heard they're doing a new,
    better fontshop.de site a long time ago. Come on, where is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You can link directly to fonts at Fontshop, and you can even set type and
    point size for your links. See <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_meta_bold/&sample_text=Student%20Centers&sample_size=36\">here
    for 'Student Centers' in Meta Bold</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_scala_regular/&sample_text=Student%20centers&sample_size=36\">here
    for 'Student centers' in Scala</a>. \r\n\r\nLinking to FontShop isn't new, but
    they've just changed it so that when you 'Generate Sample' for custom text, a
    link appears under it that says 'Link to this Custom Text.' "

  body: Jan - As Stephen alludes, FontShop.com is the more current and advanced site
    for FontFonts. Linking is indeed a small problem for Germans as FontShop Germany
    has its own site at FontShop.de and you'll be redirected to it on the first click.
    After clicking the link a second time you should land on the FontShop.com page.
