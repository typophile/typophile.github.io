  be surprised to see a Meta  Documentary to come in the near future following the
  success of the Helvetica one. \r\n\r\nWatching television, I see commercial after
  commercial with Meta used (mostly phone numbers). TBS uses it in some of their promos.
  I also saw is on the side of a Herman Miller Delivery truck this morning, probably
  7000pt high. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this topic has any merit, but I love Meta and
  I'm glad it's giving Helvetica a run for it's money. Competition is good!"

  body: I'm not seeing a surge of FF Meta. It's always been a consistently popular
    alternative to the cold modernism of Helvetica. But is there a new trend? I don't
    think so.

  body: "I'd be pretty surprised if Meta sees any serious gains over Helvetica in
    the future. Some designers/professors already treat it as being and out of style
    1990s font, and that attitude is likely to pick up steam as books about design
    from the period appear. I think that it's more likely to die off for a while,
    and then slowly sneak back into common but less noticeable usage\u2014like Helvetica
    did."

  body: "I've only been using Meta for a short while, I didn't know it was \"big\"
    in the 90's. For the time being, I've been noticing it a lot more since I've started
    using it... like when you buy a new car and all of a sudden everyone's driving
    the same one. \r\n\r\nSeeing Meta used in TV station promos and weird infomercials,
    and then locally on billboards and mailers. Easily used as a substitute for Helvetica.
    \r\n\r\nSorry, if I implied that there was a recurring surge of popularity, I
    was just making an observation."

    more of a typeface immediately after the first time I use it. Perhaps we should
    name the syndrome -- probably something better than what I usually call it: "Everyone''s
    copying me!".'

  body: "Stephen: It's a weird syndrome, you never notice something till you've seen
    it, and then your eye just becomes \"trained\" to see it all the time. I imagine
    it's much like how you're able to identify all those mysterious typefaces so fast.\r\n\r\nHenry:
    I personally like the more inviting quality the lines of the face have, the bits
    of character in the serifs, such as the l, and t and even on the a. It gives Meta
    an approachable personality that Helvetica lacks, all while maintaining a solid
    utilitarian position.  "
