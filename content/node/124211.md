    1897_ might be close to a font.\r\nClosest match I found so far is Goudy Catalog

    also ran is Stratford [img:sites/default/files/old-images/StratfordAsSince1897_6347.gif]

    as a base for making _FILSON_ [img:sites/default/files/old-images/StratfordMediumAsFILSON_5708.gif]

    recreating the look of |FILSON| (you\u2019d also have to refine the serifs):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/hoefler-text/\r\n\r\nOr
    use Hoefler Titling Bold, which has finer serifs:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-titling/styles/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HoeflerTitling_4664.png]"
