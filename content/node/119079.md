    Effra is in both their databases, neither kicked it back as a match. Guess the
    sample was too low-res.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Glad to help! I recognised it right away because of the characteristic \u2018g\u2019
    (and probably because I have used it myself). One font identification service
    that would have caught it is <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com\">Identifont</a>.
    You only have to answer a couple of questions, which is usually possible even
    with low-resolution samples."
