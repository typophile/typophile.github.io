  first post here, I hope this is the right section for this request...\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a font made like this, without any success.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously the
  flickering line is only due to my sketching, it should be precise and geometric
  instead, with monoweighted line, vertical proportions and straight vertical lines.
  Somewhere between DIN, Vitesse, Stratum, Isonorm and Geogrotesque... these at least
  are the most similar ones i found in these months. Lower case and different weights
  are welcome.\r\nI could draw it by myself, but i would take too long for a decent
  result, so I ask if there are similar fonts, I think i saw it somewhere but can't
  find it now.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nGabriele"

    for better exposure.

    to the identification of specific typefaces, I don't know if there's a typeface
    like this ;)\r\nMaybe I could move it there, if there's no problems with the moderators."

  body: "Definetely a good font, very similar to what I asked, maybe just a bit larger.\r\nI
    just bought Monocle (I have to say that with glyphs, ligatures and alternative
    styles it deserves the money they ask for it) but I also downloaded this and surely
    I will use in the future. I'm still looking for this kind of font so if you know
    others let me know anyway ;)\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: How about [[http://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/|Titillium]]? It's not quite
    as strict or unilaterally straight as your examples, but it's a sort of DIN-proportioned
    vertically oriented neo-geometric.
