body: "As I may have mentioned elsewhere, I stumbled into type design by semi-accident
  and have been trying to teach myself the basics ever since.  Workplace Sans is the
  font that got me into the whole mess. :)\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/index.html\r\nSample
  PDF (1.1 MB): http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/Type-Workplace.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
  warrants a rather lengthy explanation, so here goes...\r\n\r\nWorkplace Sans is
  a font for computer UIs (that is, program window text).  I knocked together the
  first version back around 2003; not because I had any real interest at the time
  in creating fonts for their own sake, but because I needed it for my software interface
  design work.  I was designing UIs for a niche operating system (OS/2) that used
  a system-specific bitmap font called \"WarpSans\" for window text.  I preferred
  to do my concept drawings under Windows but WarpSans doesn't exist in Windows (and
  the font format is an obscure one not supported on any other OS).  So I picked up
  TypeTool and set to work designing an outline font which would rasterize on-screen
  to look like WarpSans.  \r\n\r\nAt the time I knew nothing about letter or type
  design.  I didn't really know where to find any information either, so I basically
  made things up as I went along.  I also had no ability to hint my font, so I had
  to obtain the pixel precision I wanted by contorting the actual outlines (it helped
  that I only needed one specific point size).  I periodically put builds up on my
  website; I got a small amount of feedback, but not much. \r\n\r\nThen something
  unusual happened.  A trend started in OS/2 software development to publish software
  that ditched the native OS font rendering in favour of FreeType.  This has various
  advantages, including the ability to antialias text.  However, the FreeType library
  doesn't support the OS/2 bitmap font format, and so any program using it for rendering
  could not display WarpSans.  That meant that these programs wouldn't match the visual
  look of the system... unless a TrueType replacement for WarpSans was made available.
  \ Lo and behold, somebody realized that Workplace Sans was out there, and free,
  so they started telling people to get and install my font along with their application.
  \ Software that requires my Workplace Sans font now includes the OS/2 ports of Firefox,
  OpenOffice.org, the QT libraries, and some others.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a mixed
  blessing from my point of view.  It was good in that my work was getting tons of
  exposure.  It was less good in that its flaws were also getting tons of exposure.
  \ Also, with FreeType, the font is anti-aliased by default, which shows up its weirdness
  a bit more; on the other hand, it also meant that I didn't need to be so obsessive
  about how the font rasterized in black-and-white pixels, so I was free to make the
  design a bit more regular.  So I began a long process of trying to learn about proper
  type design so I could turn Workplace into something I wouldn't be embarrassed about.\r\n\r\nMy
  website includes <a href=\"http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/archive/design_history.html\">an
  illustrated history of the evolution of Workplace Sans</a> over the last nine years.
  \ It might be good for a laugh or two.   \r\n\r\nAnyway, about the font itself.
  \ Yes, it's quite homely.  It's supposed to be utilitarian rather than attractive.
  \ I was constrained to a large extent by the design of its bitmap model.  Its major
  aim is to conserve space without sacrificing too much legibility.   It's mostly
  intended for control labels, menu items, and so on - not for large bodies of text.
  \ However, it actually doesn't do too badly in paragraphs when printed, especially
  at 8-10pt size.\r\n\r\nIt is meant for 9pt display at the default OS/2 screen resolution
  of 120dpi  -  this is equivalent to 11pt under 96dpi, which is what Windows XP mostly
  seems to use.  No idea what it looks like on a Mac.\r\n\r\nSupported characters
  include Latin-1 and -2, various other Latin diacriticals used in Baltic countries,
  Cyrillic, Greek, and various miscellaneous symbols.  The \"Light\" weight also includes
  Hebrew and Japanese Halfwidth.  (The Cyrillic and Hebrew sets have been vetted by
  native speakers, but not by native type designers.  The Japanese characters are
  still rather crude.)\r\n\r\nThe name \"Workplace Sans\", besides evoking \"Warp
  Sans\", derives from the name of the OS/2 desktop environment, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_Shell\">Workplace
  Shell</a>.\r\n\r\nNow that's all said... I'm curious to know what knowledgeable
  people actually think of it."

  body: "I'm not especially fond of it myself, if truth be told.  As my first ever
    typeface, it's hardly a surprise if it's less than stellar.  Of the three fonts
    that I've designed over the past few years for computer UI text, this is IMHO
    the weakest.  \r\n\r\nBut I've got people relying on it now, so I keep trying
    to polish it into something halfway respectable...\r\n\r\nAt one point I tried
    creating a less blocky-looking counterpart, more in the grotesque style, called
    Workplace Gothic.  It was never really finished.  However, I've just dusted it
    off and am starting to put it through a serious overhaul.  Maybe it'll be fit
    for the light of day eventually.\r\n"

  body: Here's a question. Are the ligatures shown in the sample PDF designed for
    use in text, or special to the operating system? I agree with your statement that
    Workplace Sans is a special use font. I downloaded it and I'm thinking about it.

    text, or just taken by themselves?  I don't have a great deal of scope to widen
    them and still stay true to the original model; in fact, I seem to recall trying
    them fractionally wider at one point, but that caused them to rasterize too wide
    at 9 point.  (No ability to do manual hinting, alas.)\r\n"
