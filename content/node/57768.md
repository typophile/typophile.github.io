  example: I have the character \"Q\" in MS Word at a size of 16 pt, this size is
  actualy 21 PPM in FontLab.\r\nI also have the character \"\u20AC\" at a size of
  10 in MS Word and which is actualy 13 PPM in FontLab.\r\n\r\nNow my question is,
  does somebody have a list of all these conversions or a formula by which I can convert
  MS Word pt values into PPM values for FontLab?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n"

    screen resolution) / 72 = PPEM \r\n\r\nso this would mean your screen rasterizer
    is at 96 pixel per inch DPI.\r\n\r\n16pt*96/72 = 21.33 or 21 PPEM\r\n\r\n12pt*96/72=

  body: "Rudy, \r\n\r\nthe formula that Vincent has given above is in the FontLab
    Studio 5 user's manual in the first section (\"Font Scaling, PPM\") of chapter
    9 (\"Hinting\"). I do recommend reading the FontLab Studio manual since it really
    includes some useful information about font development :) \r\n\r\nPlease note
    that 96 is not always the default DPI size on Windows. Some notebook manufacturers
    pre-install Windows with the \"Large fonts\" (120 DPI) setting, and of course
    some users have the choice to set a yet different Custom DPI. I used to work on
    a 133 DPI setting for quite some time on my Dell notebook (which had a 1600\xD71200
    15 inch screen so the pixels really had a physical resolution of 133 DPI, and
    the default 96 DPI setting rendered type so small that it was unreadable). \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

    before I posted, only at that time I was searching for other info. By the time
    I needed this info, I didn't remember where I've read it and what it was called
    :P\r\n\r\nI never change the DPI size of 96, I've gotten to used to it. The manufacturers
    pre-install always been 96 DPI with me so far. \r\n\r\nBtw the manual does have
    a good explanation about the DPI conversion, thanks for the help Adam :)\r\n\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: ">I actualy did read about Font Scaling...\r\n\r\nMe too! I use this formula
    a lot, so res/72 * pts = ppm, is the choice of professionals as the easiest input
    to a calculator. \r\n\r\nA higher dpi device generally means a given ppm appears
    smaller.  And, at a higher dpi, a given point size requires more ppm to remain
    the same size.  \r\n\r\nSo... indicating as that Vista dialog box does, that higher
    \"DPI scaling\" yields bigger type must be a windows way of saying 'OS zoom factor',
    cause though dpi does change from device to device, it does not scale. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
