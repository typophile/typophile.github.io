body: can anyone offer a little basic information about getting started on taking
  really rough sketches of random characters that may not even exist &#40;non-computor&#41;
  and turning the subtle things you like about the shapes into actual characters?
  for example... <BR> <BR>-are there certain characters that are better to start with?
  &#40;a,e,n&#41; <BR>-should the drawn sketches be as tight as humanly possible to
  ease the digitizing process later down the road? <BR> <BR>maybe any other tips and
  problems you guys have run into would be of some help? i&#39;ve got tons of sketches,
  i just want to start narrowing some of them down and soon, put them into the computer.....
  but one step at the time. thanks! <BR> <BR>w|m

    to get some preliminary information on how to create a font.  This was very helpful
    and detailed, but I am curious, is there an easier way?  I am 'extrememly' new
    to this, but have some exciting fonts I would like to create and share with the
    world.   Any advice that anyone could provide for me would be very much appreciated.
    \ Thank you.\r\n\r\nJoe"
