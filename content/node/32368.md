    href=\"forums/typeid/faq/#Q_16\"><strong>And logos of sports teams?</strong></a>\r\n<em>There
    you have to keep in mind that sports merchandising -- everything from baseball
    caps to soccer jerseys -- is big business, so the popular sports teams have every
    reason to make their logo as difficult to imitate as possible. Most of them are
    custom designed or use heavily customized existing fonts.</em>\r\n\r\nThis logo
    strikes me as a typical example of a custom designed logo. The team was active
    from 1978 to 1980, so they probably either used some flair typeface that was popular
    at that time as a basis, or designed the logo from scratch. Only very few of this
    type of ornamented typefaces made the transition to digital, most of these thanks
    to [[Jason Walcott]]."

    read the FAQ part about sport logos. I was just sure I saw a similar font, so
    I decided to try)"
