  go with Minion <BR>Pro? At the mo I am using Minion&#39;s SC,  <BR>but I reckon
  it isn&#39;t really suitable because <BR>the are used extensively through the  <BR>publication.

  body: 'Gerald, <BR> <BR>You&#39;re mistaken about the optical size thing. The OpenType
    version of Minion Pro comes as a set of four different optical size variants,
    including one labeled &#34;display.&#34; This covers all the characters in the
    font, not just caps as in the original &#34;titling&#34; release. Indeed, the
    main type page on Adobe.com right now has a prominent billboard for an article
    on optical size in Adobe type: see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html</a> <BR> <BR>That
    being said, in this case the &#34;titling&#34; companion would be used for 12-13
    point text. The display and titling faces were designed for sizes &#62;24 point.
    One could possibly use the subhead face, at a slight stretch. <BR> <BR>However,
    regardless of what optical size of type is in use, that alone does not create
    visual contrast given that they are being used at reasonably appropriate sizes.
    So I&#39;d also think about using a heavier weight, or perhaps italics, to create
    that contrast. <BR> <BR>One could of course also change to another type family.
    Some sort of humanist sans or classic grotesque would go well with Minion.'

    The sacrifice of MM technology &#40;due to many things but not least pure old
    greed on the part of Adobe&#39;s owners&#41; <BR> <BR>What nonsense. <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s
    &#34;owners&#34; are and were stockholders, who do not participate directly in
    corporate decision-making. The people primarily making this decision were at a
    low enough level that none of them had particularly large amounts of stock. The
    amounts of money involved in making this decision either way would not have been
    large enough to have a noticeable impact on Adobe&#39;s stock price &#40;though
    many such decisions do add up&#41;. <BR> <BR>I suppose you can put it down to
    &#34;greed&#34; if by that you mean that the people deciding to phase out MM technology
    came to the conclusion that the costs of keeping it were very large &#40;true&#41;,
    and that the folks who buy fonts didn&#39;t care much &#40;true for the overwhelming
    majority of font customers&#41;. <BR> <BR>Although I personally wish I could do
    MM OpenType fonts, I know that I&#39;m in a minority. Although many people miss
    MM technology sort of &#34;in principle&#34; it seems very few folks outside of
    Adobe ever released MM fonts. <BR> <BR>T

    every manager and every programmer there. An employee is accountable for satisfying
    the owners, period. This isn&#39;t kindergarten. You as an employee are given
    some room to wiggle, but only to keep you a sane employee - if you diverge too
    much, you&#39;re outta there. <BR> <BR>The reason MM died is that it was only
    seen as worthwhile if it could make tons of money, fast. The benfits to the craft
    of typography are totally irrelevant to capitalism. Stock owners want that yaght,
    and they want it NOW. They don&#39;t have time to wait - they have to gather as
    many toys as possible before they die. Stock owners don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s-arse
    about typography. <BR> <BR>When a company becomes public there is no way it can
    maintain overall quality - it&#39;s a simple fact of human nature - even if it&#39;s
    an overall macro direction and not micro guidelines - the micro stuff comes from
    the macro, obviously. Chuck and Biff either had too much faith in capitalism,

    assert about why MM has died is simply untrue. You weren&#39;t there, and I am
    pretty sure none of your information comes from people who were; it&#39;s just
    your creative supposition about the reasons. <BR> <BR>FWIW, I don&#39;t disagree
    very much about the broad issues of publicly held companies. They need to satisfy
    their shareholders by making a profit. Luckily, Adobe&#39;s primary means of making
    profits is to try to make software that our customers want. But there&#39;s no
    question that with publicly held companies the profit motive is often orthogonal
    and sometimes opposed to quality. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I&#39;m sorry that Thomas has dropped out here. I really didn&#39;t mean to
    spark a ruckus. I&#39;d done some beta testing for Adobe in the 90s and had visited
    the folks in the type dept a couple of times. I thought they were quite earnest
    and had a great deal of vision. I suspect that Adobe itself probably saw the type
    as more a very good way of putting their corporate face out there and so tolerated
    what was most likely not a very lucrative venture. <BR> <BR>But I have a naive
    question or two here about MM technology. Wouldn&#39;t it be useful in creating
    the various instances required for optical sizing in OT? I guess I am thinking
    that the software is actually being used for that purpose. Adding it to OT products,
    however, I assume, would probably present a nightmare of incapability?  <BR> <BR>I
    remember there were problems with MM at first but these were resolved quite well.
    My comment about 1995 was made because I am still using this stuff for my work.
    Mainly for letterpress configuration of digital type. <BR> <BR>I realize it is
    not completely gone as FontLab has the ability to generate MM fonts or at least
    to create interpolated instances. But I have not yet tried it. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: While I have purchased and used many of the MM fonts from Adobe since they
    were first introduced by Mr. Warnock at Seybold, I, in retrospect, realize that
    I almost never used them to create instances of my own and simply used their numeric
    equivalent of font variations for bold, light, etc., much like Adrian Frutiger
    used his numbering system in Univers &#40;55, 75, 57, etc.&#41;.   <BR>Their was
    something relavent and fasinating about the concept of MM but I never seemed to
    get it to fulfill its potential so I just used MM fonts like other font families.
    <BR>There was also something funny about the optical corrections &#40;or rather
    lack-there-of&#41; when going from weight to weight.  I don&#39;t know if this
    was due to the nature of MM or just that the font designers were just too new
    to it to make it work better.  An example is Myriad as opposed to Frutiger,  Whatever
    was needed to corect the forms from weight to weight was done perfectly in Frutiger
    but there is something seemingly left undone in Myriad.  This may be just my 60-year-old
    eyes &#40;although I was much younger at the time&#41;.   <BR>I am sorry we have
    chased off Mr. Phinney from this thread since he may be the only one among us
    who can help clarify this.  I for one promise to keep the discussion centered
    on typography and not on the failings or merits of Capitalism.  I would hope that
    Thomas might either reconsider his departure from this topic or that he might
    send me his thoughts on the matter directly. <BR> <BR>Chris L

    sense</i> based on what I <i>have</i> heard, and based on the wider context of
    how insidiously software usually gets developed these days&#42; and how little

    possibility: that the Adobe type people honestly believed that droves of people
    would buy into MM, and everybody would be happy, and they convinced the owners

    Adobe had so little business sense. <BR> <BR>So with what I <i>do</i> know, I

    insults is pretty long. Given that, his most recent insinuations about what it&#39;s
    &#34;convenient&#34; for me to believe &#40;in this and another thread&#41; seem
    to be starting down that same path. I am not terribly interested in getting into

    dealt with his nonsense. What he chooses to believe, even in the face of contradictory
    statements from people who were actually there, is up to him. <BR> <BR>However,
    there&#39;s no reason to punish the discussion for my aggravation with Hrant.
    Perhaps we can try to talk about the design and technology issues, and even the
    reasons for MM&#39;s demise, and keep things away from the personal attacks--and
    away from presentations of complete speculation as if they were facts. <BR> <BR>Chris&#39;s
    comments about his usage of MMs are right on the money. We did a survey of end
    users, and we discovered that very few of the people who had MM fonts ever made
    custom instances with them. Multiple masters were a technology that were very
    little used by end users. We&#39;ve already talked about the reasons, which were
    nothing to do with capitalism per se but everything to do with insufficient evangelism
    both internally and externally. <BR> <BR>That lack of MM evangelism came from
    a simple lack of understanding that such evangelism would be necessary. Yes, the
    reality is the scenario that Hrant dismisses as &#34;unlikely.&#34; <BR> <BR>Microsoft&#39;s
    role in the demise of MMs was relatively minor, although I think some of us misunderstood
    it briefly at the time. Adobe supports MMs via ATM. Microsoft doesn&#39;t support
    MMs at the system level. For MM support to continue indefinitely without Microsoft
    support, Adobe would have to keep on making ATM forever and update it for every
    OS version. That&#39;s assuming it would even be possible as MS continues to increase
    the security of the OS. <BR> <BR>Originally OpenType did have MM capability built
    in &#40;for PostScript flavored OpenType only&#41;. But it was clear that it would
    be a very hard sell. Like Apple&#39;s AAT, why would vendors who had ignored MMs
    for almost a decade suddenly change their mind because of this repackaging? Adobe
    would have had to evangelize both technologies simultaneously. This concern about
    diluting our focus, given limited resources, was a major part of the decision
    to discontinue MMs. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure exactly which of several things
    Gerald is referring to about arguments regarding standardization of OpenType tables.
    It&#39;s certainly true that any font technology that offers decent support for
    complex scripts will itself be a complex technology &#40;at least in that area&#41;,
    and have to be very clearly documented. Sometimes things are not well written
    and the spec must be made more clear. Also, people debate the addition of new
    layout feature tags occasionally, but that&#39;s a natural thing with an extensible
    font format. In both areas OpenType has advantages over both Type 1 and old-fashioned
    TrueType. <BR> <BR>Hrant is not really getting the current situation with hinting
    and font rendering very well. The truth is, as the rendering technologies get
    more sophisticated, the hinting is largely just getting in the way. That&#39;s
    why traditional superhinted TrueType fonts don&#39;t work well with ClearType.
    I had once thought that TrueType&#39;s advantage in hinting would vanish when
    screen resolutions got high enough, maybe around 2015 or 2020. Instead, the rendering
    technologies and LCD screens are eliminating this advantage much quicker than
    that. Maybe cell phones and other portable and home devices will give traditional
    TrueType superhinting a niche for a while. But I wouldn&#39;t want to bet on it.

    attitude is exactly what makes a technology that only has cultural value unsellable.
    Just look at how seldom people use true smallcaps! Designers who bundle smallcaps

    <BR>The rendering technologies are not getting sophisticated <i>enough</i>&#42;.
    At current typical resolutions subpixel rendering is still not good enough&#42;&#42;.
    The only way what you&#39;re saying could make sense is if you pretend people
    like extremely blurry type - noting that apparently they hated it a couple of
    years ago... Adobe&#39;s CoolType is a bad joke, an escape from the rigorous requirements
    of onscreen readabillity. Same with the <i>parody</i> of text rendering in Mac
    OSX. <BR> <BR>&#42; And they probably never will because, again, there&#39;s not
    enough money in type. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Even many technophiles have a problem

    there are many reasons not to like ClearType. <BR> <BR>It should be obvious that

    be limits to how pure a state it&#39;s allowed to exist in&#42;. And pragmatically,
    I&#39;m personally saying that if you must engage in capitalism, one limit that
    should definitely be imposed is public ownership of companies. There&#39;s no
    way you can maintain the integrity of the product when the people ultimately deciding
    the company&#39;s course simply don&#39;t care about the product - they only care
    about the money the product can bring them. <BR> <BR>&#42; For example, even in
    the extreme form of capitalism in the US, there&#39;s something called price gauging:
    the last time we had a big earthquake some guy went to jail for selling water
    at $10 a gallon. The thing is, I firmly believe that Target for example could
    have pulled something like that off - they&#39;d just need to bribe the right

    &#40;which is much older than MM&#41;. It it the subset that is under the control
    of the user &#40;with no knowledge of the mechanics of interpolation&#41;. It&#39;s
    not just a matter of money, but expertise and analytical talents. We have trouble
    getting people to use relatively simple methods of creating instances, you want

    alt="uncool"> <BR> <BR>I chose something easy, mind you: DIN. In fact it was the
    second document I tried; the first one, in Electra, was much worse. <BR> <BR>I
    looked at three different zooms, which translate here to 14, 12 and 9 PPEM. <BR>
    <BR>All three sizes have that annoying color friging typical of subpixel rendering.
    <BR>Some people don&#39;t mind - although you&#39;d need to do a lot of field
    testing to gauge the true effects. <BR> <BR>The large size has some obvious alignment
    problems like the bar of the &#34;t&#34; - something the most retarded form of
    hinting would fix. And what should we think of that &#34;s&#34;? <BR> <BR>The
    medium size is better overall, although the &#34;s&#34; is still cruddy, and the
    spacing &#40;and form&#41; of the &#34;r&#34; is faulty. <BR> <BR>The smallest
    size is surprisingly the best in some ways &#40;still a bad &#34;s&#34; though&#41;,
    but the subpixeling is ruining its contrast, firmness, and grayness. <BR> <BR>Lastly,
    all three show a lousy rendering of diagonals, which are coming out too dark,
    ruining readability. <BR> <BR>If you think hinting &#40;super or even &#34;plain&#34;&#41;
    couldn&#39;t improve the rendering here, I&#39;m simply speechless. <BR> <BR>--

  body: 'How could you criticize something you&#39;ve never seen? Well, probably the
    same way you could assert as &#34;fact&#34; information that was pure supposition,
    for which you had no personal or even direct second-hand knowledge of. <BR> <BR>But
    that aside, you did not say whether you were referring to CoolType the DLL, which
    includes grey-scale only rendering, or CoolType the color device-dependent rendering
    technology. I wanted to specify that the latter shows the current limits of what
    Adobe has done with on-screen text rendering. So I wanted to make sure we were
    talking about the same thing. <BR> <BR>Several things to keep in mind: <BR> <BR>1&#41;
    Everyone should remember that this is only intended to be viewed on an LCD screen.
    Anyone who is viewing it on a CRT will not see the intended effect; there&#39;s
    a reason it&#39;s off by default. &#40;Hrant &#42;still&#42; hasn&#39;t said whether
    he&#39;s viewing this on an LCD screen.&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; Don&#39;t assume
    your personal experience of subpixel rendering is typical. As the research shows
    &#40;c.f. Kevin&#39;s presentation at ATypI&#41;, different individuals have different
    responses, and they very widely. I can&#39;t recall the exact percentages, but
    I think it was on the order of 5-10% of viewers who are ultra-sensitive to color
    fringing in subpixel rendering, but again sensitivity was widely distributed.
    <BR> <BR>As for this particular case, there are definitely some problems with
    the larger size being rendered there, such as the bar of the t as you note. I
    too hate the s as well. However, without examining the font in a font editor,
    I can&#39;t say whether those problems are due to an error in CoolType, odd letterforms,
    or bad hinting. <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t say whether these are TrueType or PostScript
    outlines, by the way. <BR> <BR>But in any case, without picking apart the actual
    font to see what the hinting was like, I can&#39;t say whether better hinting
    could improve the rendering. However, I can say that in most cases when starting
    with well-made fonts, better hinting within the limits of current hinting technology
    won&#39;t help all that much in either ClearType or CoolType. Adobe could improve
    on the current auto-hinting tech for PostScript outlines, but not immensely &#40;and
    yes, we have looked into it pretty carefully&#41;. <BR> <BR>If what you mean to
    say is that &#42;not&#42; using a sub-pixel rendering technology, simply using
    hinting alone, will produce better results on an LCD screen, the available research
    pretty consistently contradicts that assertion. <BR> <BR>If you want to critique
    subpixel rendering technology, it&#39;s also best to show the alternative. Care
    to show the old-style system rendering of those same ppem sizes of FF Din? <BR>
    <BR>Finally, in regards to your parting shot, Hrant, you attack lots of people
    without acknowledging it, so I&#39;m not special in this regard. The funny part
    is you calling yourself &#34;objective.&#34; I&#39;m sure that a poll on this
    or any other forum of people who know you reasonably well would generate numerous
    positive adjectives to describe you, but I&#39;d bet a very nice dinner that &#34;objective&#34;
    would make few if anybody&#39;s lists of your personality traits. <BR> <BR>T'

    sub-pixel optimized bitmaps, or sub-pixel hinting. <BR> <BR>This is very unlikely.
    The one thing that could be done is starting a stem at other than a pixel boundary,
    but still having it be a pixel thick, as long as it is at least one pixel away
    from the next nearest stem. <BR> <BR>Anything more than that, and you run into
    the fundamental complication of sub-pixel rendering: the three sub-pixels have
    different brightness values, and create different levels of color fringing. So
    you can&#39;t create a single bitmap &#40;or superhinted outline that is operating
    at the subpixel level&#41; that works well regardless of phase relative to the
    sub-pixel grid. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s why you need to start relying on the rasterizer
    instead. <BR> <BR>There are separate questions about what levels of color fringing

    comment that people viewing the samples need to use an LCD screen. So you&#39;re
    just repeating what I said, only claiming it&#39;s somehow a disagremeent or insight.
    Re-read my post above your last one. <BR> <BR>If you had looked at as many defective
    Type 1 fonts as I have, you would not assume that just because it&#39;s from a
    reasonably reputable manufacturer there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. I&#39;ve
    seen a font from an reasonably major vendor with a 1000-unit em that had a blue
    zone of something like 30K units in size. I&#39;ve seen a font from a major vendor
    that had been scaled, but the hints hadn&#39;t been scaled with the outlines.
    <BR> <BR>Odds are excellent that DIN has no such major problems. But I&#39;m not
    going to leap to assumptions about the cause of the problem without sufficient
    data. <BR> <BR>You continue to place words into my mouth, and imply things that
    I neither said nor believe. I never said that one couldn&#39;t devise new technologies
    that take even better advantage of subpixel rendering. Indeed, I&#39;m quite certain
    one can, and am kicking around some ideas in this area at Adobe. Nor did I say
    that sub-pixel rendering eliminates the need for human input. I merely stated
    that current TrueType super-hinting technology is rendered largely superfluous
    and obsolete by any sub-pixel rendering technology. I never said that sub-pixel
    rendering eliminates the need for human hinting, and I do not believe it to be
    true &#40;at least, not for TrueType; PostScript outlines have always been more
    susceptible to decent auto-hinting, though a human clean-up afterwards is ideal&#41;.

    not true. As discussed in another thread, MS were hinting outlines to fall on
    specific sub-pixel boundaries for the first version of ClearType. This gave them
    better control over stroke contrast within the limitations of the early CT renderer.
    In more recent versions, they have improved the colour filtering to provide <i>
    the same quality of contrast without needing to hint to specific boundaries.</i>
    The only point of superhinting with current and future releases of ClearType would
    be to modify glyph shape at specific sizes, i.e. to deliberately make the screen
    rendering lower fidelity to the type design. In the case of some designs, there
    may be a good argument for that, but why not just design better typefaces for
    screen?

  body: This is all rather moot anyway, since ClearType deliberately ignores x-direction
    delta hints, which means you can&#39;t really do &#39;superhinting&#39; for CT.
    Ironically, the reason for this is that existing superhinted fonts originally
    intended for b/w rendering, e.g. the MS core and web fonts, render better in ClearType
    if the x-direction deltas are ignored. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still not convinced that
    there is any significant gain to be had in trying to superhint in the x-direction
    for ClearType. That is to say, I&#39;m not sure that the desired results would
    be appreciably different from what you get without such hinting, presuming of
    course that you are starting with a typeface that is suitable to the medium. Some
    typefaces are unlikely ever to be very readable on screen, regardless of how good
    the renderer gets, how high monitor resolutions get, or how much work is put into
    superhinting them. Some typefaces are also crap on paper. What I like about ClearType,
    and what I would think would appeal to you Hrant, is that it throws readability
    back to type designers; screen readability used to be almost completely a technical
    issue, now it is a design issue.

  body: No, FontLab does not support device exceptions in hinting. <BR> <BR><i>Does

    I said. We were talking about text on screen, presumably at typical reading size,
    under a specific rendering technology. Regardless of whether one views hinting
    as design or not -- and I think the degree of design involved in hinting depends
    on the typeface and on the particular ppem size --, type on screen used, necessarily
    to rely on hinting as a largely separate process from the design of outlines.
    One could optimise the outline design process to make hinting easier, e.g. by
    wrapping outlines to pixels at specific sizes, but making readable type meant
    distorting the outline to achieve something that may or may not actually look
    like the typeface in question. My point is that ClearType, by increasing effective
    resolution while drastically improving contrast over greyscale rendering, reduces
    the need for distortion of outlines to present clear, readable forms on screen
    at a wide range of sizes. If less distortion is necessary, screen readability
    can be addressed in outline design in ways that were previously impossible.

  body: Kris, may I be so bald &#40;!&#41; to suggest a classic American  <BR>geometric
    sans. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/metro-2/" target="_blank">
    Metro</a>/<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/" target="_blank">
    Geometric 415</a> springs to mind. <BR>Maybe combine a slightly spaced all-caps
    and a more <BR>conventional lowercase/uppercase setting. If you think  <BR>it&#39;s
    too wide substitute with Jim Parkinson&#39;s <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/fonts/riclt.html"
    target="_blank"> Richmond</a>. <BR>And no, Futura is no alternative. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"

    <BR>Truly.

  body: 'Kris, I agree it looks fine. If you are doing large titles, above 36 pt,
    a possible alternative is Poetica&#39;s small caps, which are a bit lighter and
    more varied, but from the same hand and similar in design to Minion.   '
