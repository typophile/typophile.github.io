  body: "The roman is generally all right, but there is a rigid awkwardness that pervades
    the italic. The loops in particular seem like a strange decision. But I guess
    it would not be a productive suggestion to change the whole look of it after release.\r\n\r\nSome
    mistakes in the extended Latin set: \u0141 requires a diagonal stroke. The strokes
    of \u0111 and \u0127 should cross through the ascenders. \u014B should not have
    a serif interrupting the descender. It seems you have somehow confused lowercase
    \u013E with capital \xCE."

  body: Also, was it on purpose to have the strokes cross and make a hollow area in
    some of the accented glyphs?

  body: "Hmmm, I think it would be easier to critique constructively if it wasn\u2019t
    released yet\u2026\r\n\r\nI agree about the italic looking awkward in some details.
    The vertical cuts seem very distracting and the italic /e/ looks condensed in
    comparison to, e.g. the /a/.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the hollow areas are a common
    problem that occurs when two (non-joined) closed vector shapes overlay and are
    exported as a pdf."

  body: "Daniel,\r\n\r\nas you already released this font, the proper place to post
    was Release section. Anyway, as you did post here, I suppose you are asking for
    some critiques in order to improve future versions of Ataxia.\r\n\r\nYour Roman
    resembles a lot Guardian Text and Cordale \u2013and, in a minor degree, Enclave.
    I like these fonts, especially Guardian. So I also like your overall design. But
    there are some problems you may address:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>. bar in |t|
    and |f| are very big. This disrupts the equibilium of the glyph. |t| could be
    a bit shorter at right, but |f| needs mode reduction.\r\n\r\n<strong>02</strong>.
    |g| would benefit with more space between upper and bottom ellipsis. I did this
    error in my onw [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|font]] and a fellow Typophiler
    pointed me the problem this brings in small sizes. As you have very good counterspaces,
    it's easy to reduce a bit the bottom orey to get more air at the center.\r\n\r\n<strong>03</strong>.
    straight cut on top of |q| stem is a bit strange, it does not combines with other
    elements.\r\n\r\n<strong>04</strong>. middle bar in |F| is OK, but it becomes
    very short in |E| due to the bottom bar.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>. almost all
    curves and connections are good and well designed. But the bottom curve of |C|
    is still not there, its thick variation does not follows overall curves.\r\n\r\n<strong>06</strong>.
    cedilla is very much ellaborated to Ataxia general style. You can try a simpler
    shape.\r\n\r\n<strong>07</strong>. tilde is excellent. The same with acute/grave.
    I also like these diacritics positioning. But dieresis must have more gap between
    dots and Hungarumlaut must have less. Breve needs to be bolder. I cannot evaluate
    other diacritics at the size of your images. But it seems ogonek and eng leg are
    going beyond descender line, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nAbout italics, I second
    Kevin (Cerulean) and Joerg opinion. I particularly dislike the cut you applied
    to external curves in |e|k| and descenders. This straight cut is out of the normal
    fluidness of glyph shape. I don't see a reason to this cut, which is far from
    the other design elements.\r\n\r\nClosed descenders in italic |g|y|z| are also
    strange. Ataxia has a rational design, almost without calligraphic or decorative
    elements. But these lassos are typically calligraphic and brings some deco. Thus,
    they become like strangers in your design.\r\n\r\nAlthough I pointed several issues,
    I did like Ataxia. It could be improved and become a great contemporary serif."
