  I need help tracking down\r\nsomething like this quick sample I made that's similar
  \r\nto what I'm looking for.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/read_6738.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  saw a posting on another site a few weeks ago that \r\nannounced a new family had
  been released that had similar\r\ntraits to this but I can't remember where/who
  it was.\r\n\r\nFutura Display in the old Letraset catalog has some of\r\nthe features
  I want (very upright, rounded corners) but \r\nthe M and N are lowercase and look
  dated, and I really \r\nneed something contemporary looking\r\n\r\nthanks in advance."

    at:\r\nhttp://www.woodardworks.com/type13.html\r\n\r\nIf you using an OpenType
    app, there is a stylistic alt \"R\" that is more like your original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR\\V"

    point of reference would be the David Boring\r\ntitle that Dan Clowes drew. Normally
    I would just hand\r\nrender what I need, but this needs to clean and crisp."
