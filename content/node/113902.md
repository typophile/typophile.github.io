body: "Hey Guys. I'm trying to find a range of typefaces which all have meanings behind
  them. This could be what they are influenced on, or where the aesthetics of the
  typeface come from or anything similar to that, they just need to be a fonts with
  a meaning and purpose behind them, not just for aesthetic qualities.\r\n\r\nOnly
  a found a few so far. A lot of Jonathan Barnbrooks fonts have meanings behind them....\r\n\r\nMelancholia
  - depression, sensitivity to the world. The font attempts to put some of the sensitivity
  into the letterforms.\r\n\r\nProzac - aesthetic of the font looks like it is designed
  by scientists. The shape of the letterforms seems to mirror tablets and capsules.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could suggest some typefaces it would be really helpful. Many thanks."
