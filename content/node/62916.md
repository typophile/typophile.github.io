  this stationary and logo design. Included is a business card (front and back), letterhead,
  and envelope. Would love to hear anything you have to say, good or bad. Thanks!\r\n\r\nA
  quick note about the company. It is a photography group specializing in couples,
  weddings, engagements, and other \"people\" photography (for instance, seniors and
  babies). I didn't want to make the colors too feminine or masculine, so I tried
  to incorporate elements of both to make it appealing to both sexes.\r\n\r\nedit:

  body: "I don't think the symbol works well with the name. I see hearts and that
    it forms a flower but what does it stand for? Considering the name of the company,
    I think it would be great to make something creative but relevant.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    there seems to be a lot of different fonts going on. You have a script, serif
    and sans. I don't mind the script alone but not with the serif underneath, at
    least not that one.\r\n\r\nI don't think the black suites the identity. I would
    like to see some yellow-orange in there. Try livening it up. Make it fresh looking.
    When I read the company name, I want to feel refreshed or happy. \r\n\r\nAlthough,
    this is all just my opinion.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I think the name inherently sounds feminine, so that may be a loosing
    battle. :)\r\n\r\nI agree, the colors are a bit awkward. Also, I've had bad luck
    trying to print solid black, unless it's printed as a spot color. It feels heavy
    and serious with that amount of black. Give the yellow and orange a shot, muted
    maybe, like a mustard color. \r\n\r\nI would also suggest picking just two of
    the typefaces as well."

- body: "I disagree, strongly, that black is \"heavy and serious\" but; it is hard
    to print well. Have you tried a brown background, perhaps even with a scratchy
    linen texture? It might help unify the inky script text with the logo. Maybe even
    a charcoal gray like this might work?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stationary-3-4_5751.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stationary-2-3_4037.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if you have a scale problem that creates the lack of unity, not the color?
    The logo is so big compared to the company name, it looks like it could crush
    it. Which is confusing, since it looks so light and gossamer. It looks as if it
    should float, not double as a wrecking ball."

    Alaskan has a good point about the scale; perhaps that's what was making it look
    heavy to me.\r\n\r\nThe logo reads much less like a flower when the pink is absent."

- body: "Why not attach your new versions in your new posts? It gets really confusing
    otherwise. I've never understood why some people do this - is it a browser issue?
    Can't you add images in your new posts? \r\n\r\nThink of it like this; when a
    brand new visitor reads your top post, they see all three revisions. Then, all
    the comments that follow have to be correlated to the proper version -- but those
    comments happened before the new versions appeared, BUT, a new reader can't know
    that before they read down to the very last post? Confusion! \r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    the longer a thread gets, the more frustrating it becomes to scroll up and down
    to figure out what the heck people are talking about. :) \r\n\r\nOr, maybe, I
    spend too much time reading threads on Typophile and I need to get out of the
    house? \r\n\r\nNah."

    scale is better, but it looks as if you've given little thought to how the logo
    relates to the logotype. On the business card it's in one place, and on the stationary
    it has a totally different relationship, and on the envelope; yet another. Find
    an arrangement that works and stick with it across the board; anything less looks
    sloppy.  \r\n\r\nOh, and getting rid of the pink was a big improvement -- maybe
    the blue of \"photography\" can match one of the shades in the flower?\r\n\r\nAll
    your running text is suffocating. Track it out to increase readability, and check
    to make sure your kerning is set to optical - right now, it all looks awkward,
    but that could be just the tracking? It could also be the painful buzz of bright
    white on a dark color; try giving the text just a touch of light gray to calm
    it down."

    I may well be missing something!) I cant seem to figure out how to attach documents
    to new comment. Does \"Insert Image\" function much in the same way as attach
    does, in the mother post?\r\n\r\nI agree completely with the tracking, it is way
    too tight. This is currently at the top of my list of necessary improvements.

    the images in the post (like mine above.) I suppose that's the source of confusion,
    eh?  But; PDF files are not permitted with the \"insert image\" link, so that
    probably causes  people with PDF files to stick with the top post. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not certain, but I suspect the PDF files are discouraged because the vectors are
    easy to extract and therefore easy to rip-off somebody else's design work? Pixels
    (jpegs, pngs) of letters and logos are much harder to reproduce and/or scale.\r\n\r\nAK"
