body: "Hi- \r\n\r\nI am updating my company's logo which was made from a script font
  straight out of the box.  I would like someone to change approximately 4 letters
  using computer manipulation to make it look more like a designed logo. I *do not*
  want this done \"by hand\"/pen and ink, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a logo (of letters only)
  used on the internet or very small on business cards, etc, so it doesn't need to
  be done at extremely high resolution.\r\n\r\nMy company is small. I am committed
  to being fair but I don't have a big budget.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see samples of work
  you have done using font manipulation or lettering design and an idea of what you
  charged  on example projects so I can get an a idea of your pricing before answering
  the question, \"What's your budget?\" because 1) I don't know yet and 2) it will
  depend on the person I end up working with. \r\n\r\nI'm serious and not looking
  to waste anybody's time. If you are young, talented and working freelance, you're
  probably the sort of person who'd be compatible with this project.\r\n\r\nPlease
  contact me at wt.billing@gmail.com to discuss further.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Modifying a font file is prohibited by many type foundries, but not modifying
    the lettershapes to make a logo.

  body: In other words, read the font's license carefully to make sure that modifying
    it and using it as a logo doesn't violate the license.

  body: "WT: What usually gets lost in these discussions is this: Type is no longer
    a physical object -- you no longer buy type. What you've bought is a license to
    use some software. That license has restrictions about how you use the software.\r\n\r\nThere
    are ways to modify the characters generated by font software without modifying
    that software. That's legal, at least, in the U.S.\r\n\r\nIf someone can do the
    needed work in a layout program (e.g., InDesign), it is also relatively inexpensive.
    If not, then it is going to get costly, probably more than if the work was done
    in a font editing program.\r\n\r\nAs people have said, check the EULA (font license)
    for the font. Or, if it is an Adobe Original, we can assure you it is permitted
    to modify the software (do the work with a font editor).\r\n\r\nYour best way
    out, if the font is from one of the smaller publishers, might be to have the font
    designer do the work. Some would, some wouldn't. Doesn't hurt to ask."

  body: "Yeah but don't type designers just get around all that EULA stuff by simply
    doing a revival? That's what you guys call it right ...a revival? You know, tweak
    a letter shape here and there and call it your own ;) And besides, a creative
    interpretation of an original copyright ain't illegal. Otherwise art students
    would getting kicked out of every gallery in world ;)\r\n\r\nOver the xmas break
    I saw my one of graphics (poster I did for the U.N.) show on the back of some
    playing cards! \r\n\r\nKatherine, I love your 'come on in' video. And just on
    a side matter, have you considered using tattoo models with your pin-up pieces?\r\n\r\nn.

  body: ">it doesn't need to be done at extremely high resolution\r\n\r\nEven if you
    don't anticipate needing it in a large size, a professional would almost certainly
    prepare the logo as vector art, which means it doesn't have a resolution like
    a photo, it's art that can be enlarged to any size without loss of quality. (Google
    \"vector graphics\" if you want details.) \r\n\r\nThey will probably give you
    copies in several formats, but at least one of them should be a vector format."
