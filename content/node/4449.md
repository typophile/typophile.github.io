  body: 'Very tasty, Kris. <BR> <BR>My only comments at this time are as follows:  <BR>
    <BR>&#42; The 6 and the 9 seem a bit off balance. Perhaps trimming the tails a
    bit would help. I just get the feeling that they&#39;re leaning over. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    The ear of the &#39;g&#39; is softer than it needs to be with respect to the other
    serifs. <BR> <BR>&#42; It&#39;s probably just me, but the curved transition on
    the top of the &#39;t&#39; feels out of place.'

    at all?

  body: You did that in two days?! Wow. Very polished already. <BR> <BR>It sort of
    looks familiar &#40;although I&#39;m not saying you swiped anything&#41; - I guess
    it reminds me of Caecilia, although it&#39;s less humanist &#40;which I think
    is working great&#41;. <BR> <BR>The &#34;g&#34; is really nice! I do see a bit
    too much humanism in it though &#40;compared to the rest&#41;, so maybe make the
    joins &#40;especially between the head and bottom&#41; more rigid. <BR> <BR>For
    the &#34;t&#34;, try making the curve two straight segments instead. And maybe
    cut the finial like the &#34;e&#34;. <BR> <BR>The &#34;s&#34; seems to be leaning
    a hair forward. <BR> <BR>&#62; I have found a &#40;subtle&#41; slab very fulfilling
    to make, don&#39;t quite know why. <BR> <BR>Probably because you feel surrounded
    by hipocrisy, and straight lines &amp; abrupt shifts are more &#34;honest&#34;
    - if also less interesting. Wedge serifs can be a great compromise. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Kris, <BR> <BR>This is really nice. I think it warrants pursuing. I like
    the slope on the slabs, and the stature of the letters <b>f-r-a-i-n</b> especially.
    They seem somehow both secure and proud. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s not too early to
    indicate specifics: I agree with Grant &#39;n&#39; Hrant that the curved transition
    in the &#39;t&#39; doesn&#39;t fit and you might want to look at making straight
    segments here instead. To my eyes the &#39;e&#39; leans a little right too much.

    and PMN Caecilia, as well as Officina  <BR>and Silica. &#40;Is it that obvious?&#41;
    I am trying for something <BR>structurally quite sound, that has a intial feel
    of a sturdy <BR>slab, but a bit more subtle. I find Caecilia too sharp, and <BR>Oranda
    too soft. But those would be my only slights  <BR>against two excellent types!  <BR>

  body: 'This has wonderful qualities: assured, balanced, graceful.  I would like
    to see it in text setting in PDF. I agree with folks that the 6 and 9 need fixing,
    and the g and t made more harmonious with the rest. If the top of the loop of
    the &#39;g&#39; were made more horizontal would it  harmonize with the rest of
    the face better? '

  body: 'HI Kris. <BR> <BR>Nicely done. I&#39;ve got a slab in the cooker too. I like
    what you  <BR>have started! <BR> <BR>Here are some thoughts: <BR>The width seems
    inconsistent to me. The glyph that first drew  <BR>my attention was the n. Looks
    wide. Then maybe the m a little  <BR>too. Maybe the u a hair, b mabe a little
    narrow. Ok, enough of that! <BR> <BR>The bracketing in the top of the t is out
    of character. <BR> <BR>Keep an eye on your serifs. Many of them look equal on
    left and  <BR>right. This is sometimes best, but often not. Consider your n.  <BR>Part
    the width issue is that the inward halfs of the serifs equal  <BR>the outer halfs.
    You can shave the insiders down, maintaing the  <BR>white space and while allowing
    you to narrow the glyph. Also  <BR>check your v. It&#39;s like the n in reverse.
    The inner halfs can afford  <BR>to be longer, but the outer halfs need to be as
    short as you can  <BR>manage. Otherwise the spacing will be a nightmare. Some
    of this  <BR>will become more evident as you begin spacing. <BR> <BR>Old Style
    Figures: <BR>Do they have serifs? Where? <BR>Does a four sit on the baseline?
    <BR>Does a four descend to the depth of a five? How close? <BR>Do the top of the
    five and seven line up? <BR>Is a nine a rotated six? <BR> <BR>These are all questions
    to ask. I think the answers are: it  <BR>depends. OSF are a weird animal. Look
    at a wide gamut of OSF.  <BR>Attached are 6/9 comparisons for a handfull of fonts.
    In Caecilia  <BR>the 6 is exactly a rotated 9. In other cases, the only adjustment  <BR>is
    for ascender descender height &#40;Sauna&#41;. Sometimes it is vastly  <BR>different.
    It seems the more upright the stance, the less  <BR>adjusting is needed. All of
    that said, I think yours look pretty  <BR>good. &#40;Maybe snip back the tail
    on the nine and round out the  <BR>tail curve a bit more.&#41; <BR> <BR>More please!

  body: i love your font, but i usually work with a italic condensed &#40;not only
    the version slanted&#41;. <BR> <BR>if you compress a little more your italic,
    you will have other gray. <BR> <BR>i cant print your pdf in this moment, but seeing
    the proporsions, i will hope a similar gray in both versions &#40;regular and
    italic&#41;. <BR> <BR>if you are looking for a version to emphasize a text in
    your block, i think you have obtain another gray. <BR> <BR>JP

  body: In your shoes I would not worry about making a &#34;humanist slab-serif&#34;
    &#34;too similar&#34; to your models. <BR>There are such a few being good, the
    best thing probably is stopping looking at them &#40;if not for spacing&#41; from
    this point on. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not enough qualified to comment a lot, but I would
    try to make the tail of your lc &#34;y&#34; thicker instead of thinner. <BR> <BR>The
    numerals &#40;my cup of tea&#41; you used in the setting seem unbalanced. If you
    wish to keep them non-lining someway, I&#39;d reduce the &#34;short&#34; ones
    &#40;0, 1, 2&#41; and adjust the others&#39; position accordingly. Otherwise,
    if you wish them to be more lining, keep the ascending and descending ones subtler.
    And condense that zero. <BR> <BR>Best luck!

    keep you posted though. <BR> <BR>Cheers Claudio. The numerals are the first sketch,

  body: 'My personal taste is in having the lowercase &#40;oldstyle&#41; numerals
    as first choice. Even if you choose an hybrid my observations still hold value:
    you need to reduce the height of the numerals, and adjust the zero width, I think.
    I don&#39;t recall which but there are good text faces with &#34;hybrid&#34; numerals.
    <BR> <BR>Weiss&#39; numerals, for example, are pretty lower in height &#40;although
    I don&#39;t like Weiss too much, except the Italic&#41;, but I don&#39;t recall
