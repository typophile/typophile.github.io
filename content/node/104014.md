  are sorted by the number of combinations. \r\nGlyphs with higher combination comes
  at the top and the one with less combination goes down in the list.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I am merging the feature file using File ->Merge Feature Info, merging happens fine
  but when I check the Lookup, I find that the sort order is lost.\r\n\r\nThere are
  few thousand ligatures. Its an Arabic Font. \r\n\r\nHow do I keep the order of feature
  file?\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nRegards,"
