  way various flavors of OSX deal with type have always been pretty popular. I've
  now started working on one about [[http://www.prepressure.com/fonts/basics/osx-lion|OS
  X 10.7 Lion]]. Can't wait to get my hands on the new OS, even though I only want
  to install it on a test partition. New operating systems always need some time to
  settle.\r\n\r\nFor some odd reason that new Emoji typeface fascinates me. I am aware
  that this is likely 'not done' on this site (insert bottom right emoticon here).\r\n<img

  Color Emoji\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone has information on which font file formats
  are supported in Lion, that would be appreciated. I cannot imagine Apple keeping
  up support for some of the older formats. They got rid of floppy drives early. They
  moved to an entirely new OS some 10 years ago. Now the new Mac Mini no longer has
  an optical drive. Apple is known for its willingness to get rid of technology they
  consider outdated. When will they dump Type 1 fonts?"
