  sketches and I invite you to take a look:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jefflomaxdesign.com/fonts.html\r\n\r\nIt
  starts down at the bottom of the fonts page, but the 2007 group is where the majority
  is at right now. I have a lot more scanning to do, but I figured I'd set it out
  here anyway. Feel free to comment, critique or rip apart, just remember they are
  only sketches. And for the serious folks, I should warn you that they are 99.99%
  display styles. There are quit a few that I would like to take all the way to completed
  typefaces but I'll need to get some other projects out of the way first."
