body: I have a kern class called "oright", which have the glyph d in it. What happens
  if I accidentially set a separate (different) kern value for d? Which value is overridden
  upon export?

  body: I believe a kerning exception will be set. In that case, the exception value
    will override the class kerning value (assuming the kern feature is well formed).
