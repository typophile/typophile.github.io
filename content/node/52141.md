body: "Hi friends,\r\n\r\nSome years ago I found a photoshop action that could take
  a font or logo, and transform it into a series of dots, a bit like the Killers logo
  (pictured here).\r\n\r\nI have just spent several hours trawling the net for this
  action.\r\nCan anyone here perhaps help me with the name of this action, or point
  me in the direction where I might find it.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance.\r\nNS.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Unless you need to do this a lot why not just build the dotted letters yourself
    in Illustrator, tracing over your text with dots on a small grid, or use [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/|fontstruct]].

  body: In Grayscale mode select type then use Pixelate-Color Halftone Filter - set
    all to right angles, 90, 180 etc. Set pixels to size of dots, try 25 in 300 dpi
    file and run filter, redo till get size right.

  body: To get the precision of the Killers logo you'd need to do it by hand (FontStruct
    is a good option). Halftone filters are much more irregular, not suited for type.

  body: "Not an action, but i can suggest an alternative technique to achieve this
    visual effect. You can create a simple repetitive patten of dots and then do Pattern
    Overlay in photoshop layer effects. \r\n\r\nThat might create some jagged outlines
    with some typefaces, but most of the time you can apply it quite easily and frequently.\r\n

  body: "Ya Simon, you are absolutely right. It does create half dots sometimes on
    the edges.\r\n\r\nBut that can be solved with a little tweaks/manual add-ons,
    and the result will be surely faster than drawing each and every dot manually.

  body: i don't think so if you use fontstruct... once you are use to the interface
    it's quick fast, expecially for a job like this. plus you can make a whole alphabet
    which can use used in almost every program that uses text. quite handy...
