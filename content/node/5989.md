body: Dear all <BR> <BR>I wonder if someone can give us a hand trying to find out
  which are the fonts &#40;or the font if it is only one&#41; used on this titling
  for a book cover. So far we have only found Trajan and ITC Cerigo that ressemble
  the sample, but note the flat tip of the upper case A &#40;unlike Trajan&#41;, and
  also the sans-serif middle bar of the E. The ampersand, being uncommon, should be
  relatively easy to track down, but we have not come across something like it within
  a font ressembling the other characters. Please disregard the long vowel marks and
  the underdots, unless you have some specific information. <BR> <BR>MANY THANKS IN
  ADVANCE! <BR> <BR>JA<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42430.jpg"

  body: I can see why you liked Cerigo for a bit, with the odd serifs on the A and
    the unserifed middle arm of the E. Matthew Carter&#39;s Alisal also has both of
    these features, but other letters do not match, including the italic. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    still hunting...

  body: This typeface is something like a cross between Zapf and Slimbach,  <BR>but
    the italic makes me think it&#39;s Slimbach.

  body: The italic in the sample is more calligraphic than slimbach... it would be
    helpful to know the source and when it&#39;s from. Could be pre-digital? Shares
    some character traits with Bembo, like the cap A, but it is not Bembo.

  body: 'The italic is actually pretty close to Poetica Chancery, maybe horizontally
    scaled a smidge. '
