I am publishing a children's picture book, and am thinking of use Century Schoolbook Font. 

the images are very rich, and think maybe something more "blobby" would work. I would really appreciate advice on the font choice, so that I can get maximum benefit. I attached some images from the book, so you have an idea of what Font might go well with it.

General question. For a children's picture book, who is the target audience? Is it the adult buyer and out-loud reader? Or is it the four year old who is just starting to figure out what these letters look and sound like? If there is a compromise, which way do you lean?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree with the resident gurus who propose Comic Sans. Using it with these illustrations turns the book into a McBook, quickly forgettable and something less likely to attract sustained interest. It also precludes the opportunity to encourage children to be able to transition from unstructured lettering to the serifed fonts used in most adult books. Finally, as a parent, I would go stir crazy reading Comic Sans day after day to a child. I can't see any charm of a child's fantasy world in Comic Sans.

		<div class="commentbody">I don’t believe I actually recommended Comic Sans, I merely said that it would be better than Besley.

Without seeing the page layout, size, and the amount of text on a page, I would be loth to recommend any particular face.

However, I will say that I think it is really stupid to use fonts that have been created by ham-ﬁsted adults to look as if kids drew them. It shows zero respect. After all, most adults’ writing is just as terrible as most children’s, and yet we honor adults with the sophistication of Bembo and Garamond.

Looking back at my favorite books when I was a child, they were set in the same fonts as adult books. Garamond, Baskerville, etc., including Century Schoolbook, of course.

This “cloisonné/coloring book” technique of illustration reminds me of the Mr Men books I read to my children in the 1980s, for which the typeface was Univers, IIRC.</div>

Normally, hand-drawn letters are technically not as perfect as printed letters. That doesn't mean they can't be perceived as beautiful.  Many people, especially parents, may find children's drawings to have some kind of beauty in their own right.  Now I think it shouldn't be forbidden to show such pieces of beauty or wake associations with them by similarly-styled drawings or fonts.  An image like that reminds me of the fun children have scribbling and drawing and of their creativity.  It doesn't remind me of limited abilities.

Of course, that doesn't mean these associations are appropriate in every case that involves children.  It may be that such "childish" fonts are used too often.  But still, I think it's perfectly acceptable to use them if they fit the topic.  Just as it's acceptable to use imperfect adult handwriting fonts in some cases!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, I think that kid’s art, lettering and writing is lovely, not terrible.
That was also the sentiment of artists such as Picasso and Klee, who sought to capture some of its naive quality in their own work.

But a font like Besley is a poor emulation, most obviously because it has no “pseudo-random” quality.
For instance, it makes no sense that the glyphs are supposedly imprecisely drawn, and yet you get two /l’s together that are absolutely identical! 
And everything adhering to rigid baselines.
It’s a travesty of what it purports to represent (unless the typographer goes in manually to bounce, rotate, and scale letters so that they vary each time).

It’s purpose in a book like this is to signal “this is for children”, not “this is to be read by children”.

The bad writing of adults, whether innate or feigned, is quite a different thing than the emerging ability of a child.

Why not hand-letter or hand write the text, or get a child to do that?

		<div class="commentbody">Nick is right that the lines and fills in the artwork have a smooth digital finish, and so should the type. I thought Les's suggestion of Maiandra was good--it's got some personality, but it doesn't fight with the art. 
Romiko prefers a serif, though. And low contrast with blunt serifs is one way of interpreting <em>blobby</em>, so maybe this is a job for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/souvenir/|Souvenir]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cheltenham/|Cheltenham]], both designed by Morris Fuller Benton, who also designed Romiko's first pick of Century Schoolbook.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree Cabrito works, but I find that it is rather bland like a machine text  and unlikely to stimulate the child's imagination. Also, for an adult reading to a child the monotone style might be reminiscent of reading something produced on a typewriter. Perhaps not a problem for younger adults who have never seen a typewritten page.

		<div class="commentbody">Don, could it be a problem for people who <em>have</em> seen typewritten pages?  I think typewriter appearance to be nice, because I associate it with individual, hand-made documents (in contrast to machine-made documents like serial letters, advertising, etc.).  It has a more personal touch in my eyes, which is the reason why I use typewriter-style fonts for printed letters.

Cabrito’s unagitated style (to avoid the term “bland”) is, in my opinion, in line with the illustrations.  I think rich colours and image contents can still provide a lot of fuel for imagination.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like typewriter type and own several vintage typewriters, but I don't think typewriters have been in common usage in the U.S. since the late 1980s.   Typewriter fonts used to be a common graphic design look, but not so much anymore (except in certain specific situations).  I still like the look (I'm in my 50s), but anyone under 35 or so may have never used one, so it may have little meaning other than looking retro.</div>
