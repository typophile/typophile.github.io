  body: Someone from Men&#39;s Health finally got back to me, essentially confirming
    Tiff&#39;s ID, though the contact said it was MHM Relay Wide Black, a custom face
    made just for the magazine, which would explain any aberrances. I don&#39;t know
    what that MHM stands for.

  body: i am a happy owner of the Relay Wide and i checked..  there is not an alternative  G  <BR>
    <BR>i reckon they put a hyphen or a string on top of the  G  just to make it look
    groovie..  any way i like the Relay G:s as they are..  and if i wanted my G Granted
    like the &#34;Grant Her Wish&#34; i would have used Interstate instead.

    target="_blank">DaniloBlack</a>, was involved with the redesign and thus the reason
    they have their own tasty versions of certain letters.
