The first sign I photographed was an obvious choice because it represents one of my favorite places in New Orleans, Frenchy&rsquo;s gallery on Oak Street. A friend of mine manages the gallery and I love hanging out there. The sign itself is painted by Frenchy in his bright, unique style that is purely New Orleans. The gallery is a place that could only be found in this city, where tourists and regulars alike stop by to drink, smoke, bullshit, and bang away on the artist&rsquo;s paint-splattered piano, and I think the almost crude, handmade sign perfectly captures the style of Frenchy&rsquo;s paintings and the mood of his gallery.</p>

Another New Orleans institution close to my heart is Jacques-Imo&rsquo;s. Jacques&rsquo;s is also on Oak Street; in fact, it&rsquo;s right across the street from Frenchy&rsquo;s and next door to the Maple Leaf Bar. The close proximity of these three locations to each other and to my apartment has created a Bermuda Triangle of fun that&rsquo;s almost ruined my college career several times. Though I don&rsquo;t think the sign captures the feel of Jacques&rsquo;s as much as the painted pick-up truck permanently parked outside the restaurant, I must give it credit for being truly New Orleanian in its colors and fleur-de-lis symbols. The strings of Christmas lights and red and blue spotlights around the sign hint at the restaurant&rsquo;s potential for crazy.</p>

I have never been to Tee-Eva&rsquo;s, and now that it is up for sale, I guess I never will get a snoball there, but I still have the fond memories of stumbling past this bright building on late Thursday nights. The whole front of the building is a sign for Tee-Eva&rsquo;s Creole Soul Food and I think it&rsquo;s one of the best signs in town. It&rsquo;s certainly eye-catching. To me, the vibrant colors represent fun and laughter and everything good food and New Orleans are about and I wish I could have eaten there once instead of just stumbling by.</p>
