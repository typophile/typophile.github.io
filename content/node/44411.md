body: Is there a way to create a PDF and not have the outlines extractable? I'm not
  too worried about it because extracting and composing back into a workable font
  would be alot of work, I'm just curious about this, I'm sure it's been discussed
  before.

  body: One sure way is to turn the pdf into a picture (in Photoshop) and then save
    it as a pdf. It'll lose some sharpness in the process.

  body: You will lose the "font" and it will become "image". At that point you are
    no longer showing your font.

  body: "Thats what I figured\u2026 to have a nice pdf that allows you to zoom in
    and see the characters clearly (one character filling the entire screen) the characters
    are extractable. If it's turned into a picture you lose the clarity and the file
    size increases at higher resolutions (allowing enough room to zoom in and see
    full characters)."

  body: "The rule of thumb, actually quite logical one is: if the computer can take
    some vectors and turn them into bitmaps so they can be shown on screen, then there
    are some vectors there. If they are there, they can be transformed into other
    vector forms. \r\n\r\nIt's a question of cost and effort. As far as I know, there
    still is no \"out of the box\" software for exctracting fonts out of PDF files.
    There are some semi-manual methods but they're good for kids who have lots of
    spare time on their hands, and will end up with incomplete character sets and
    zero kerning tables anyway. \r\n\r\nA."
