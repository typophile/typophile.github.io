body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI sent my files to the printer with several swashy alternate characters
  in the headers.\r\n\r\nThe printer's blueprints have come back with those characters
  appearing as regular, superscript characters.\r\n\r\nHe is suggesting that my font
  file is corrupt. Yet it is the one that came with CS2. Please help! Any suggestions
  would be good....I've got to get something to him by 9:30 tomorrow morning. I'd
  like to use the swashy characters if possible, but might have to go with the plain
  ol' regular ones if I can't find a solution to this.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: "Kristina \u2014 Did you send an ID package or did you generate PDFs? I strongly
    recommend to provide PDFs only. If the glyphs you mentioned still don't show up
    in the printer's proofings, using your press ready PDFs, I guess the printer has
    to upgrade to the most recent version of Acrobat. (Let him at least upgrade his
    Adobe Reader.) If his RIP is not compatible, there is nothing left but to convert
    *all* your type to outlines. Or even better: generate TIFFs from each page yourself
    at the output resolution of your printer's plate setter."

  body: "Jason - well, what are they called? I promise I won't say it again if you
    tell me the proper terminology -- What about \"fancy\" ;) \r\n\r\nIt's only certain
    alternate characters that I'm having difficulty with. The capitals, for example,
    are fine.\r\n\r\nHmmm.\r\nThe printer doesn't want PDFs. The files were packaged.
    I also provided a PDF, but for viewing purposes only. I will give him a high quality
    print version tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, the same thing happens when I open
    the files on my home computer. I used think it was my home computer that was wonky,
    but now I must conclude that there's something off about my work computer. I'd
    like to figure out how to fix the problem, not work around it.\r\n\r\nThanks!
    \r\nK."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI may have found the problem. \r\n\r\nThe version of Minion I
    have at work is older than the one I have at home. Is it possible that the version
    did not update when I went from CS to CS2? I'm betting the printer has the same
    version as on my home pc. Well, crossing my fingers that he does, anyway.\r\n\r\nbah.\r\nK.\r\n\r\nswashy

  body: "Kristina, I had a similar issue with an ornament in Minion. I set the file
    up in CS and put my ornament in place. But when I opened the file in CS2 the ornament
    was replaced with the letter P. Each version of InDesign was calling on the font
    at a different location, and the two files were different; same bug as you: one
    was the newer, updated version.\r\n\r\nSo, the trick might be to scan your hard
    drive for multiple Minions and check the dates, then move the old ones somewhere
    safe (or get rid of them), so that your system is only calling on the newest version.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your printer, make them aware of the version issue, and tell/remind them tactfully
    that they should be installing YOUR fonts, not assuming their version of Minion
    is the same one you sent.\r\n\r\nps. Plain old \"swash characters\" does the job,
    no need for the pesky \"y\" -- but I'm a grouchy old man who severely punishes
    my students if I can even <em>remotely</em> apply the word \"cute\" to anything
    they produce for class, so don't listen to me. Go ahead, swashy away."

  body: "Aha. That is precisely what's happening. Thank you for the help.\r\n\r\nI
    can't seem to find *any* minion files on my computer, but I will search some more.
    I also, oddly, still see CS folders and files. I thought uninstalling would completely
    remove them, but I guess not. will work on it some. \r\n\r\nFor the time being
    I think the printer has what he needs to do the job.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nMy
    excuse is that, having studied creative writing, I can (very tongue in cheek)
    claim that I am wildly cutting edge and working on ironic  language-based experiments
    in constructing/deconstructing (as the case may be) new and misunderstood forms
    of creative expression. ;)\r\n\r\nBut don't worry; I have a stickler in me, too.
    And as for old... I believe I'm only a couple of steps behind."
