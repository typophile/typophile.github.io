  my friends are dead'.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a similar style I'm looking for
  is on the book cover to 'The Heart Keeper'.\r\n\r\nI havn't yet been able to find
  either in my academy's library.\r\n\r\n\r\n I don't know if there are many free
  typefaces like this but anything in the right direction would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,
