body: "\r\n\r\nI am a graphic design student at the University of Notre Dame and am
  doing a type specimen book on Adrian Frutiger's typeface Frutiger. I need to include
  the \"story\" of the typeface, its original intended purpose, examples of its use,
  its design characteristics, Frutiger's background, his design intent, and historical
  images and context.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the information I have been able to find
  online and in various books, but I still am in need of images of its use and just
  general information on the typeface. \r\n\r\nIf you know anything or have any images
  please let me know\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    on Frutiger]], <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20frutiger\">Google
    search for Frutiger on typophile.com</a>\r\n\r\nYou can find <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/fontsinuse-f.html\">several
    samples of the Frutiger typeface in use</a> on the Linotype website; including
    works for brands/companies like Bang & Olufsen, Deutsche Post or Mitsubishi.\r\nAnd,
    of course, it still is willingly used for signage systems, too. Only recently,
    I saw it at the <a href=\"http://www.lvb.de/\">Leipzig public transport</a>.\r\nF"
