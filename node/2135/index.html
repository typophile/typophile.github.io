		<div class="commentbody">The short answer: it was designed for the German  <BR>roadway. (DIN stands for the German Industrial Standard.) <BR> <BR>The medium answer: the different weights were not  <BR>designed at once, as a family (think the original  <BR>Helvetica vs. the original Univers). They're a loosely  <BR>related bundle of faces. Frankly, this becomes obvious  <BR>as you try to use them together. <BR> <BR>The solution: use the FontFont version. The weights are  <BR>all reworked (by Albert-Jan Pool) to maintain the spirit  <BR>of DIN (compare the Mittelschrift to the FF DIN family)  <BR>while creating a unified family. <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/">http://www.fontfont.com/shop/</a></A> <BR> <BR>If you want the full history just hope Erik Spiekermann  <BR>reads your plea. =)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Albert-Jan Pool gave me the following answer. (For your information, my employer is presently writing a book called 'Wayshowing' on the subject of signage, signage typography etc. This was the reason for my questions in the first place). <BR> <BR>QUOTE <BR>thanks for your interest in the DIN subject. 1995 Erik Spiekermann asked me <BR>if I would be interested in doing a redesign of DIN Mittelschrift, and have <BR>it released by FontShop. We thought it a good idea to create a family of at <BR>least 3 or fou weights. I came up with five, the medium resembles FF DIN <BR>Mittelschrift in weight. The regular is suited for longer reading text. DIN <BR>Mittelschrift is far too heavy for text. I started designwork by creating <BR>the light and the black version, and took care that the medium, which was to <BR>be generated by interpolation would be close to the original DIN <BR>Mittelschrift. Most of this, and a lot more interesting stuff can be found <BR>in the broschure »FontFontFocus FF DIN« available through FontShop. <BR>You can also find some details on their website. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I do not know who ever designed the original DIN. I made <BR>several attempts, without any result. <BR> <BR>DIN was originally designed for signage. Most likely in the early thirties. <BR>Most countries tried to establish industry-standards by that time. The <BR>Germans were pretty much ahead by that time, probably because the fascists <BR>were already thinking of streamlining everything for mass-production of <BR>anything needed for the war that was planned. The idea was that most sign <BR>makers would construct the characters by ruler and compass, and scale the <BR>measurements from a grid. This was thought to be easy. Unfortunately this <BR>theory ignores that most signmakers are quite good at drawing by hand. This <BR>is one of the ideas behind FF DIN. It combines strict rules with <BR>craftmanship and provides letterforms which are a bit more fluent than DIN. <BR>FF DIN also has a bit more contrast in stroke weight, the horizontal strokes <BR>are thinner than the vertical ones. Therefore it is a bit more readable than <BR>DIN Mittelschrift. <BR> <BR>When you write a book about signage it would be interesting to contact <BR>Gerard Unger. He knows a lot about it because he designed a typeface for the <BR>Dutch traffic signs. <BR>Also interesting: <BR>http//:www.urwpp.de <BR>URW has digitized a fair number of traffic types. They did the previous <BR>dutch version (a derivate of the american one), also the spanish, the <BR>danish, the french, and I believe also the english and the austrian ones. <BR>They also digitized the original version of the american &quot;highway gothic&quot;, <BR>which is not Interstate. Interstate is a redesign. Some of them maybe not <BR>available as postscript fonts because the character sets do not have <BR>accents, currency symbols an so on. They were sold to Signus customers, a <BR>former signage software package with an Ikarus-based proprietary fint <BR>format. Signus used to be very popular because of its extreme accuracy. <BR>Unfortunately the Windows version never really made it. But maybe they would <BR>like to convert the missing ones when you mention them as a source in the <BR>book. <BR>UNQUOTE</div>
