  body: Kara, I would venture to guess the first one is custom. Its one word and a
    designer would be hired to make their look unique. Ask Hrant about the pixel font
    since he is so good at iding them.

  body: I believe that the pixel font is Image Club's <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?7TO">Bubbledot
    Fine Positive</a>. The Cover Girl wordmark could be based on something similar
    to <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?7OJ">Radiant</a>.
