body: "I've seen the discussion thread concerning the use of quotation marks in drop
  caps, but I'm wondering if there is a preferred model for situations that involve
  short sentences, such as the below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have a formatting question.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's
  the problem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drop caps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've come to the right place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I
  hope so!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I drop cap the quotation marks and the I in the first sentence,
  the next few lines become indented to accomodate it.  So in a situation such as
  the one above, do I need to indent them FURTHER to indicate each line represents
  a new paragraph (and speaker)?\r\n\r\nI've thumbed through numerous books that employ
  drop caps, and I can't seem to find anything on my shelf with chapters opening with
  short bursts of dialogue as I've outlined above.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated!"

  body: "Of course, there are no rules when it comes to this. And BTW, I use quotes
    about halfway between the dropcap and text size, though rarely over 20 points.
    They are then hung in the margin. If the editor doesn't object, I just skip the
    openquote -- it is implied. Some editors won't accept this, though.\r\n\r\nAs
    to subsequent lines: If the first paragraph is less than the depth of the dropped
    cap, I indent the subsequent paragraph, and it's \"paragraph indent\" is further
    indented the additional amount of a normal paragraph indent.\r\n\r\nIn the case
    you show, with several lines all less that 1 line long, I think I'd forgo using
    a drop cap -- unless there is a compelling reason, like this is the odd chapter
    in an otherwise straightforward book. But I'd take basically the same tack as
    outlined above, indent subsequent lines to clear the cap. As long as the reader
    isn't confused about what begins a new paragraph, I think you can let the graphic
    look take over & do as you choose.\r\n\r\n"
