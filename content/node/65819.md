body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm writing a short little \"book\" called \"Essential Typefaces\",
  where I state typefaces I either consider essential or downright beautiful. I have
  4 categories: Sans-Serif, Serif, Script and Blackletter. I have 6 typefaces per
  page, and so right now I'm at the point where I need 2 more serif typefaces to fill
  the last page.\r\n\r\nI have pretty much every typeface in there that I want to
  have in there. So my question is, could you tell me your personal top 10 (or whatever
  number) serif typefaces? If I see enough typefaces I didn't put in there yet I will
  even consider adding another page.\r\n\r\nI won't be stating the typefaces I already
  have because it's too many. That's why I'm asking for a top 10, so there's a bigger
  chance to see a typeface I don't have in there yet. Also, it needs to be a typeface
  that is easily available. I'm not looking for typefaces you only find in obscure
  typography books. I already have too many of those in there..."

  body: "I said I wouldn't state the typefaces I have, but on your request I will
    state 2 serifs of each page I have:\r\nAlbertina, Arno Pro, Caecilia, Clarendon,
    Fleischmann, Haarlemmer, Lexicon, Mrs. Eaves, Proforma, Roos, Thesis, Trinit\xE9,
    Walbaum.\r\n\r\nThose are just a few.\r\n\r\nAs for criteria, I really don't want
    to state any free typefaces because they're often incomplete. Also, I want to
    keep fonts that are not well available and fonts still in development very limited.
    As this document is called \"Essential Typefaces\" I want to involve the \"legendary\"
    typefaces. I think I put in quite a few of those, but probably not all. Furthermore,
    I want some diversity. That's all the criteria I have. So just state some you
    like, regardless of whether they're considered original or unique or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it. Thank you for your input.

  body: I'll just throw in Arnhem, Berling, and Whitman. "Serif typeface" is a really
    broad category, but I'm guessing you are limiting this to typefaces for the Latin
    alphabet, widely available as digital fonts today.

    as the final two.\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestions, I have all of those in there
    except for Berling, Whitman, Goudy and Rockwell. Berling I didn't know, but it's
    beautiful. I definitely have to add that one. As for the other three, I simply
    forgot about them. I never liked Rockwell though. But I do think Rockwell is quite
    essential."

    this thread. It was an old project I kept expanding until I didn't know what would
    be the relevance of it anymore, though I learned a lot from the categorization
    in the process as it took a lot of research in history and styles, so not a complete
    waste.\r\n\r\nI've never heard of Rameau before but it looks beautiful. Why do
    you like Lubalin Graph?"

    G and the capital Q. \r\nAnyway, I am bias, I admire Herb Lubalin's style.\r\nIt's
    my favorite slab serif even though I enjoy <em>Ionic</em>.\r\nI pair <em>Lubalin
    Graph</em> with <em>Avant Garde Gothic</em>.\r\nFor the record, <em>Rameau</em>
    takes its roots from <em>Le Romain du Roi</em> and <em>Fleischmann</em>."

  body: It reminds me of the 90's which I don't find a good thing but that's probably
    a personal association which doesn't really have much to do with the typeface.
    It pairs well with Avant Garde Gothic, but I just don't like the typeface.
