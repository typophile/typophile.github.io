    faces and only came up with a Sept. 2005 release of <a href=\"http://www.canadatype.com/news/0509.php\"
    target=\"new\">Pendulum</a> from Canada Type (who also released a revival of VGC's
    Eight Ball!?). Not sure what <a href=\"http://www.canadatype.com/about.php\" target=\"new\">Rebecca
    Alaccari</a> did regarding original licensing so you might try contacting her.\r\n\r\nDuring
    the late eighties, Aldo Novarese was making attempts to license both Eurostile
    and Microgramma to Compugraphic (we met a few times and kept corresondences),
    but whether or not he had actual rights of licensing any Nebiolo designs he hadn't
    made completely clear to me."

    further transformations; photofilm, digital. And the licensing of these typefaces
    generated further income. Infringement could involve one in legal hassles.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a hypothetical case: a very well known and long-lived typeface from a very
    well known firm is suspected of being based on someone else's drawings. Since
    this face had been licensed and cross-licensed over the years, if someone could
    make the claim that the very well known typeface itself was an infringement of
    this previous design that they had legal rights to, and won an entitlement, they
    could very well seek compensation based on all moneys made over the years.\r\n\r\nYes
    people do copy metal faces all the time, and sometimes they get a letter from
    a law firm. If rights had been established and there is a legal continuance of
    those rights, as in licensing, copying a metal face is as wrong, and potentially
    as dangerous, as copying a digital face."

    certainly be doing more research,\r\nincluding contacting a grand-daughter, etc.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    this particular design apparently never made it past metal. In fact the reason
    there's no digital version is probably due simply to the fact that there was never
    a photo version! These days people will much more rarely bother with reviving
    a metal face (especially one that's hard to find actually used extensively).\r\nBecause
    you need to physically find it, and then print it!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    was trying to get at with the words \"the right\": In some contries, it is easier
    to patent the design of a typeface than it is in the US. If someone gets a 25
    year design patent, and dies 20 years into it, I believe that the patent would
    pass on to his heirs for the remaining 5 years. In this time, you could not redigitize/release
    the said design without their consent."

    can of worms, there have been those who claimed \"rights\" in the past who have
    denied revivals strictly based on \"type politics\".\r\n\r\nOne of the only type
    families that I personally wanted to revive (strictly out of affection) is <a
    href=\"http://www.neufville.com/FontData/FONTS_AZ.htm#H\" target=\"new\">Hispalis</a>
    originally from Fundici\xF3n Tipogr\xE1fica Nacional, with rights held by Neufville.
    A visit to Barcelona in the eighties got me nowhere (my primary objective was
    to license Schneidler).\r\n\r\nSomehow it's still on Neufville Digital's list
    of \"to do\" digitizations, yet RoosterTypes has a somewhat sterilized revival
    version called <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=1402&total=4\"
    target=\"new\">Schiller Antiqua</a> by Steve Jackaman.\r\n\r\nWhat I loved about
    the metal design was the eccentric \"irregularities\" which are often the first
    things to go when standardizing for digital. \r\n\r\nI know... sour grapes! :-\\"
