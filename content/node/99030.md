  allows hyphens (and other similar signs) to adjust if they are in a cap context,
  or a lower case context, or even between small caps.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: Do you mean when creating a font? Use an OpenType substitution to an alternate
    glyph in the case (or smcp) feature.

  body: "Yes, while designing a font.\r\n\r\nYou mean for example create a new glyph
    called hyphen.cap?\r\nI thought there was one way to vertically adjust the existent
    hyphen in open type"
