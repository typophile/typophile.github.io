  place to post this. \r\n\r\nI work with translators. There is a Punjabi poem that
  one wishes to be typeset in both the English translation and original Punjabi form
  (that is using Gurmukhi script). I would welcome any recommendations for any typefaces
  that cater to both conventional models and typesetting requirements of Gurmukhi
  script. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: I'm not completely clear on the question. You want a typeface that supports
    punjabi written in Arabic script and latin and also Gurmukhi script?
