    Prisma clan shown [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html|here]]
    might be even closer. There was at least one digital version of Aki Lines, from
    Image Club.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry if it seems like I'm hijacking this thread, but I've been looking for
    similar 2's. I love the way the counter looks a bit like a defiant fist. The sample
    on the left is the second-class marking on Polish railway carriages. On the right
    is a building number in London. I can see these are different faces from the different
    way the down stroke meets the bottom stroke, something which cannot be seen in
    Jenna's sample. I'm imagining a lot of customising work has been done to that,
    if it isn't in fact drawn from scratch. I'm hoping mine might be more recognisable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2two_5462.jpg]"

  body: "I think each of these samples is from a different font/typeface. The right
    hand 2, with the pointed 'nose' looks a bit like Kabel, as Craig Eliason mentioned
    above, only not quite as closed. I think this is a feature of some Bauhaus-Art
    Deco styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
