  body: "Three things that I noticed:\r\n\u2013 I am not sure about the legibility
    of the \u2018Fi\u2019 ligature. In any case I think the combination is too wide.
    Try to match the counter with that of \u2018n\u2019.\r\n\u2013 The serifs seem
    short to me. And if this is the display version of the wordmark, I would expect
    a more spectacular thick/thin contrast.\r\n\u2013 \u2018e\u2019 seems wobbly on
    the lower and upper left."

  body: "To me the \"Fi\" is OK, and it looks nice too. But the curves in \"n\" and
    \"e\" need a lot of work. And the spacing is uneven.\r\n\r\nFirst things first
    though: what kind of fashion brand? Who are the current -and desired- customers?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I too think the ligature is fine. /e/ needs to sit lower and be taller to
    optically compensate for curved top and bottom.

  body: "I would probably go for the more century like serif in your initial sketch
    instead of the bodoni style serif in your digital draft.\r\n\r\nAs said before
    the curves need some work."
