  work: We can\u2019t get the audio from the TypeCon session onto iTunes or into an
  MP3 I can download to my iPod and listen to on the subway. This is actually what
  we do with MP3s, you know. Or at least people who aren\u2019t still using IE6 do.\r\n\r\nSo:
  $10 in PayPal to the first person who can make this happen. Just put it somewhere
  I can legitimately download it. (Hint: Start a free WordPress blog and put it there.)"

    with the help of dedicated volunteers, made this available to the public at no
    cost? Volunteers make this thing happen... and most come from our membership and
    board :)\r\n\r\nWe're doing our best, Joe. Your help would be welcome."

  body: Well, it is done. As soon as I get my 10 bucks you can have your 2 hours of
    blabber about artificial scarcity. I assume that others will want this, so it
    will go up publicly then as well.
