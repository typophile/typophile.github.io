  having gone to the NY MoMA Helvetica exhibition, likes Gill Sans,  can spot Arial
  from Helvetica at ten paces and howls at the ubiquitous use of Comic Sans in schools.
  \ I'm a computer security guy, but I pored over Letraset catalogues as a child thirty-plus
  years ago and have an amateur's interest in design, although I do all my own documents
  with LaTeX.\r\n\r\nSince we cut all the household document work over onto Pages,
  my daughter's been using one of the templates that sets the body of her essays in
  Gill Sans.  Occasionally teachers say to the class ``and I want it in Arial'' but
  she reckons that means ``enough of the bloody Comic Sans already'' and keeps using
  Gill Sans, and no-one has complained yet.  If a teacher did complain, she'd switch
  to Helvetica Neue: if they spot the difference between that and Arial it'd be a
  miracle, but the extra beauty of the real thing is probably worth a few marks.\r\n\r\nToday,
  however, she asked me if there was a font that would be acceptable for school use
  for running text, easy to read, but wasn't Helvetica or Gill Sans.  `Her' font,
  if you will.  And that doesn't look anything remotely like Times New Roman, which
  is apparently `geeky' --- I take that to rule out serifed fonts.  Apparently the
  art teacher is interested in type and my daughter wants to impress her.\r\n\r\nSo,
  if you wanted a sans-serif font that's easy on the eye, legible, works well at 10--12pt
  as body text on fairly long lines, what you would use?  I own copies of Frutiger
  and Univers 55, but the former doesn't seem to sit quite right for body text and
  the latter isn't really distinctive from Helvetica/Arial in small sizes.  Any thoughts?\r\n"

    It's friendly looking, "designed to aid legibility", and for every license bought
    some money goes to charity...

  body: "It's not clear whether you're prepared to license a professional-grade font
    for your grade-school daughter (bravo! if you are), but if you're looking for
    something Gill-Sans-but-not-Gill-Sans, you and she might take a look at Jeremy
    Tankard's [[http://www.typography.net/type/font/bliss|Bliss]] or Greg Thompson's
    [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda|Agenda]].\r\n\r\nAt the very least, downloading
    some PDF samples and exploring the differences together could be a fun educational
    activity."

  body: "Frutiger is maybe a little boring, but it is very readable in body text,
    when set properly.\r\n\r\nYou could also consider buying [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesans/thesans/|The
    Sans]] from Mr Luc(as) de Groot. It has one of the prettiest lowercase g letters
    out there. Overall a very nice and accessible typeface. It is also a favourite
    of some non-designers I know. Basically everyone likes it.\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\nPS\r\nThis
    is my very first post here, so: Hello everyone!"
