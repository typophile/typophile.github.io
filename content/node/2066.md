  body: The word &#34;American&#34; is too small to identify in your sample, except
    that it is some kind of roman face that&#39;s been stretched horizontally. I&#39;m
    guessing Times. The word &#34;Legends&#34; is definitely hand-lettered.

  body: For something with a similar feel to the <i>Legends</i> text &#40;albeit without
    as much flourish&#41;, you might try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/ovidius/">Ovidius</a>
    from FontHaus.
