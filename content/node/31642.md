  \u2013 or in need of ego compensation \u2013 to google into my own past. And <a
  href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/\">there</a> it was. \r\nMy main occupation was
  designing logos and <em>charsets</em> as was the word in the day (1987/88).\r\n\r\nUsually
  it was single colour pixel charsets, but my friend programmed a back drop editor
  for me so we could design multi colour letters as well.\r\n\r\nWe attended swap
  parties, sat up all night drinking jolt cola and designing 'graphix', trying to
  socialize (not a common skill then) and most importantly, worked hard on not being
  a <em>lamer</em>. It was an intense period, probably not lasting more than a year
  or so. \r\n\r\nMy aliases were Fred and <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/scener/?id=5992\">Banshee</a>,
  and the last group me and my friends were active in was <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/group/?id=97\">Agile</a>
  (we did however NOT have anything to do with those credit card frauds). \r\n\r\nOnly
  recently did I connect those C64 experiences (<em>sans</em> the smelly feet) with
  my current occupation, as a designer of visual identities. The next thing that comes
  to mind is that a lot of people from that generation should be in our line of business
  as well. \r\n\r\nWere You there? Get yourself a C64 emulator and check those demos,
  read those cheesy scrolls and enjoy some Rob Hubbard! </strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: ">Computing has all been downhill since the C64\r\n\r\nTotally agree. Many
    a dull school day was spent drawing Vic 20 char-sets on graph paper and converting
    the pixel patterns to hex, line by line - typing them in after school and testing
    the results. After dropping out of college in 1987 my very first job was general
    dogs-body for this outfit... \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_Micros\r\n\r\nIt
    was a lot of fun."
