  body: "I used the Serif Font ID Guide and got [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-old-face/|Baskerville
    Old Face]] (or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/frys-baskerville/|Fry's]])
    as what seems closest. The W looks to have a middle serif, which would eliminate
    Mrs Eaves and most other Baskervilles. The C does not look like it has 2 serifs,
    which also points to Old Face/Fry's. The white on black lettering looks bolder
    than the reverse, so it seems to have less contrast than the black on white way
    has, but I think these Baskervilles are most likely.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The sample Spire posted does not lead me to the same conclusion as before.
    It seems to be the same typeface, but it certainly looks different to me seeing
    it that way. For one thing, it really does look rather monotone. Strangely, what
    it seemed closest to, structurally, was Font Bureau's relatively new font [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ZocaloText/styles|Z\xF3calo
    Text]]. However the italic is way off and the rest is not dead on by any means.
    The E is especially odd, and I think should be a key letter. Z\xF3calo has the
    long, underslung lower arm, and the L is rather wide, but not quite as exaggerated
    as the sample. The W looks more stepped than the Baskerville's I mentioned, and
    is more like the W's that Frederic Goudy often used, however, none of his fonts
    have an E like this, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have any ideas about
    this?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    Only Caslon 'A's lean that far.
