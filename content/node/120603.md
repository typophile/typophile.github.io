    body: "Well, I might have to jump back to Mavericks because while everything seems
      to be working correctly, my AFDKO seems to be working strangely, at least the
      autohint and checkoutlines macros in FontLab are.\r\n\r\nI'm getting....\r\n\"\r\nThe
      script cannot run the command-line program 'autohintexe'. Please make sure the
      AFDKO is installed, and the system environment variable PATH\r\ncontains the
      path the to FDK sub-directory containing 'autohintexe'.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nDavid,
      do you use the AFDKO macros in Fontlab, and if so, could you do me a favor and
      try running them?\r\n\r\nI thought I'd just try installing the newest version
      of the AFDKO, but of course the zip is missing a whole bunch of stuff, namely
      a lot of the macros system files needed."

    on my MacBook... can try a bit later on the iMac where I think I have them...

    where they were present."

      I am so dense that I haven't ever really been able to figure out how to run
      autohint and checkoutlines, the only 2 things I really need from the AFDKO.
      I read over the help files as well, and it somehow didn't really help me, haha.
      \r\n\r\nLooks like this is my homework for the day..."

    a second, can you explain how to specify the location of the OTF file I want to
    use in AFDKO in terminal?\r\n\r\nfor example, if I want to run checkOutlines on
    a file, how do I tell it where the file is located?"

    be just fine. Ditto latest versions of Fontographer and TypeTool.

  body: "I should add two caveats:\r\n\r\n- Folks using some Wacom tablets may find
    that they need old drivers for the tablets to work properly with FontLab Studio
    (and with assorted other apps), but that the old drivers are not compatible with
    Yosemite.\r\n\r\n- We have one report that while they still work, UFO export scripts
    (both from Robofab and UFO Central) seem to be surprisingly slow under Yosemite.
    I'd be curious to hear if more people have experienced this slowdown."

  body: "I've noticed a problem. \r\n\r\nRandomly I lose certain keyboard or cursor
    key functions. I was just editing a glyph and selected the tool to draw a circle
    from the toolbar. When I pressed 1 to return to the pointer tool nothing happened.
    I also lost the z and x zoom ability. Also lost was the delete key function and
    the command x for cut. These functions continued to work when selected via menu.
    When I pressed the ` key for high rez preview the preview remained after I released
    the key. Cursor keys continued to function.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions I have lost
    cursor key function. It is all appears to be random. I will pay closer attention
    to see if I can identify a pattern."

  body: "I've found in general things work as well under Yosemite as they did under
    Mountain Lion. However, today I did have Fontlab crash on me a few times in a
    row. A glitchy font file might be to blame here, I'll have to see if it happens
    again with a different font. In using my Wacom tablet, I find the screen scrolls
    up by a couple of inches whenever I put pen to tablet, but it's done that since
    Snow Leopard, so I'm not too concerned (though I'd love to have a fix for this).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nOliver "

  body: Prior to Yosemite, the fix for the tablet problem was to downgrade to an older
    driver for the tablet. However, that older driver no longer works under Yosemite.

    Yosemite is the OS. On my MacPro (almost) everything is working, but on my MacbookPro
    the \u201Cassign to keyboard\u201D button is not working, clicking on button or
    triangle next to it is doing nothing. So, it works on MacPro but not on MacBookPro,
    any idea? Thanks!"
