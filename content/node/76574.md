  Trajan Inscription. On the overleaf there's this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5790.png]\r\nAny
  idea who did it? I'm unsure who to credit."

  body: Thanks Dan. I assumed that's who it was, but it appears to be unattributed
    and my german's no good for telling me otherwise. I think I'll assume it's Kapr's.

  body: Hildegard Korger "Schrift und Schreiben" (1977) p. 80-81 has very similar,
    but diffirent drawing (Studie der Autorin), so this one could be prof. Kapr's.
