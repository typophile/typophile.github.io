  body: I think if you hadn&#39;t told me it was &#34;Stir,&#34; I&#39;d have thought
    it was &#34;Air&#34; . . . not that this is necessarily bad, if you don&#39;t
    mind -- a little punning can be a good thing. <BR> <BR>Charles

  body: That&#39;s funny. I had to go back and take a look. I see Air now, too. I
    may need to play with the way the &#34;s&#34; and the &#34;t&#34; connect. Any
    other comments about the general direction I&#39;m going in?

  body: Perhaps the word DESIGN is too close?  <BR> <BR>When I first looked at this
    it reminded me of something that might be used for a club or something ... not
    necessarily a bad thing. Have you tried lettering the word DESIGN? Not to totally
    remove it from type, but letter it tight so as to look like type but to have some
    of the same energy as the word STIR.

  body: Shouldn&#39;t the R in Stir be lowercase? The smallcap R interupts the flow
    of the word, at least IMO. I don&#39;t like the geometric sans Design, but I&#39;m
    not sold on the other typeface you chose either.
