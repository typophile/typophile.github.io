  converting an existing book design layout (done in in-design CS6) into an e-book
  for use on a Kindle reader?\r\nI have just started reading up on it and realise
  that I might have to change the font/s I have used for the main body of the book
  and probably a whole lot of things. Luckily the book contains no images, but I do
  want to retain page ends so that Chapters start on fresh pages. There is also a
  bit of text styling (custom page numbers, chapter headers etc that may just not
  be possible on an e-reader.\r\nI have been reading about exporting using fixed page
  layouts (something it seems you can only do with Creative Cloud though).\r\n\r\nI
  am hoping to use the export E-pub function (within in-design) in order to create
  the right file.\r\nI assume this leads to a layout which changes size and thus page
  count, which is fine. But I do want to keep the page ends in at the end of chapters.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be amazing as I am having to fast-track learn this new way of working.\r\n"

    Kindle Publishing Guidelines]] and then upload it to Amazon which will automatically
    convert it to Kindle format. Having some knowledge of HTML and CSS goes a long
    way. Here is some [[http://epubsecrets.com/indesign-best-practices-epub-exports.php|general]]
    [[http://epubsecrets.com/indesign-epub-basics-general-settings.php|info]] on the
    InDesign side of things, but you should also find an exporting tutorial.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    have to come to peace with the fact that Kindle supports only the most basic formatting
    (even less than EPUB, which itself is a far cry from print typography) and a few
    built-in fonts. So your only option is to simplify the layout as much as possible.\r\n\r\nKeep
    chapters as separate files and they will start on new pages. You won't have page
    numbers because the text is reflowable; styling chapter headings is fine, though.\r\n\r\nFixed
    page layouts are almost always a bad idea, especially for simple, text-based books."
