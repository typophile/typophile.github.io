body: "I came up with a new concoction which is a cross between Arabic Letterism and
  Generative Art.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/galsmall_5245.jpg]\r\n\r\nArabic
  Letterism has been around in the Arab countries for more than three decades now.
  The works of one its most notable artist, Nja Mahdaoui, have inspired me very much
  when I saw them, and one of my first abstract art works in 1984 was a Letterism
  piece in which I tried to copy Mahdaoui's style.\r\n\r\nNow, after many years of
  computer programming, computer coding runs hot in my blood. I therefore thought
  of experimenting in applying Generative Art technology to Arabic Letterism. This
  was also an opportunity for me to try the programming extension that comes with
  the Adobe Creative Suite. Using Illustrator CS5, JavaScript, and color schemes downloaded
  from [[http://kuler.adobe.com|Kuler]], I happily present to you what I have called
  \u201CGenerative Arabic Letterism\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe blog that explains more (in
  English this time) could be accessed [[http://generativeletterism.wordpress.com|from
  here]].\r\n"

      It was just after that I launched that article my house in Amman, Jordan got
      flooded and I lost my car. I started a separate project hoping to generate some
      extra cash to compensate for the early year damages. Still not there yet.\r\n\r\nI
      am happy that you liked Generative Arabic Lettersim. Do let me know if you are
      still interested in knowing more about it.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nKhalid\r\n"
