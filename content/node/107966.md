    you are going to use it on a commercial project, please be careful as I don't
    know if this is an original design (Claude Pelletier is known for sweep 'n hack
    copies of other commercial fonts)

  body: "Don't know about Claude's \"sweep 'n hack copies of other commercial fonts\"
    but as far as I can tell this is an original digitization of a circa 1900 font,
    designed for headline use where space is limited. I recall monitoring some discussion
    of creation of the font on alt.binaries.fonts during November-December of 2011,
    but I can't remember the details other than that Claude posted some newspaper
    jpegs and revisions of the font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nI don't know much about Claude Pelletier and the only reason
    I mentioned \"sweep 'n hack copies\" is that the <strong>Chopin Script</strong>
    offered as a free font by Claude in Dafont:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/chopin-script.font\r\n\r\nit
    actually looks like an exact copy of Phil Martin's <strong>Polonaise</strong>
    (1923?) which is a commercial font available from URW++\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/polonaise/urw-d-bold/glyphs.html\r\n\r\nWith
    some further investigation though, I see that Dieter Steffmann have also done
    some digital versions of the font under both(!) names Polonaise and Chopin Script,
    therefore I'm now really confused about what was the original font name and if
    URW++ has actually any (exclusive) rights on this font.\r\n\r\nI'm glad that <strong>La
    Tribune CP</strong> seems like an original digitization.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n\r\nPS:
    See also here for a previous discussion on Chopin Script (probably not a rip-off):\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/101766"

    body: "\"Phil Martin's Polonaise (1923?)\" is incorrect insofar as Phil did very
      little original work and all of it was done from the early 1970s through the
      mid-80s. Even though he claimed to have designed over 400 fonts in his lifetime,
      the vast majority of the fonts he personally \"created\" were derived from the
      work of others. The majority of the truly original fonts were licensed from
      other designers although he ultimately bought up the rights. \r\n\r\nOriginally
      Martin licensed many of his fonts to The Font Company, which is long gone. Since
      URW++ has the fonts I have to assume they are the ultimate licensee, at least.
      Phil sold his company to a close business friend when he retired. That man presumably
      still owns the rights."

    sources. A search of Keystone, ATF, BB&S around 1900 would probably clarify the
    source issue. From a technical point of view, there is not a lot of wiggle room
    in designing a very narrow, thick & thin, serif font.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Hi Fivos. No disputing that Dieter Steffmann is a prolific pirate. As for
    Chopin Script it seems to me that the previous discussion cited by you is balanced
    and useful. As far as I can see both the versions by URW and Claude meet the same
    standards of originality, as they are independently created from a non digital
    work, and both are derivative in that they rely on a previous design.  But the
    previous design was not covered by a design patent and so, in the US at least,
    \ was in the public domain. Also, in the US at least, the case brought by Summer
    Stone to prevent use of r terminals that resembled his r -- which he lost -- provides
    some guidance as to what can be copied by others. There is clear protection for
    digital outlines generated by a computer program. Otherwise.... Perhaps the only
    people who get rich from font design are the lawyers.\r\nCaveat: Non of my comments
    should be taken as legal guidance, as I am not a lawyer. Nor do they automatically
    apply to countries other than the US. \r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks George for the Phil Martin info.\r\nThe discussion of what is original
    work, what is legitimate use of existing designs, what is piracy etc. has been
    done many times before.\r\nPerhaps it started with the the 19th century technology
    of electrotyping which enabled font makers to physically lift the imprints of
    competitor's typefaces to cast their own versions. whithout having to punch cut
    a copy. Font forgery has been with us ever since. Only the technology changes.\r\nDon"
