  just love the simplicity and comedic imagery in this poster. The image appears to
  be handdrawn which I believe balances out the the rigidity of the text. Also, the
  designer's use of negative space is great!"

  body: "Allyson, you might enjoy the work of the Czech typographer Old\u0159ich Hlavsa,
    if you can find it. His book <em>Typographia</em>, my edition 1976, was like a
    revelation to me. He was, to my mind, the best in combining type with illustrations.
    Good luck."
