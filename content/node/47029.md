body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert in indesign and have a special need that I
  dont know if its possible to achieve.  \r\nI have a catalogue with 39 chapters (39
  diferents indesign files).\r\nI have a left and rigth master page.\r\nEvery chapter
  can start with a left or rigth page, depending on the quantity of the products.\r\nIf,
  as usualy happens, have a last minute product insert in the middle of a chapter,
  Indesign will reorder the next pages correctlly (left and rigth) until the end of
  the file.\r\n\r\nHere is my question:\r\nIf I have a \"book\" with all 39 chapters
  and in one chapter in the middle (lets say 10) I need to insert a new page, Indesign
  will re-order (left and rigth) to the end of chapter 10. But the begin of the chapter
  11 will not macth with the end of the 10! Because before the insert of page the
  chapter 10 ended with a left page, so the 11 must start with a rigth one. With the
  insert  of the new page the chapter 10 will end with a rigth one and the 11 will
  start with a rigth one (that can't be...it must be a left one).\r\nIs any way to
  tell Indesign to reorder \"All\" book after my insert page in order to not have
  to do it manually?\r\nHope I made my self clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    a little while since I worked with a project set up with this feature. But, I'm
    pretty sure that if you have the .indb file set up properly, with all the individual
    chapters correctly entered, then adding pages to one chapter should flow through
    to affect the start of others automatically, whether odd or even. You can even
    see evidence of the changes in the Book palette via the pagination.\r\n\r\nThe
    individual chapters need to be set up as Facing Pages, obviously. \r\n\r\nIf you
    have the Book.indb file already set up and it's not working, then look in the
    Pages palette commands to see that Allow Pages to Shuffle is checked on. You may
    need to check each individual chapter.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    the command \u201CAllow Pages to Shuffle\u201D checked off, dont I? </cite>\r\n\r\nHmmm.
    I don't think so. If I set up a document (chapter), add a bunch of pages, then
    go to the Pages palette > Numbering & Section Options and select Start Page Numbering
    At: and enter an even number, then the document automatically starts on a left
    page. (Doesn't matter whether Shuffle is turned on or off.) \r\n\r\nAllow Pages
    to Shuffle just means you can't create a spread with more than two pages. If you
    turn it off, then you can.\r\n\r\n<cite> > You can try selecting the Book > Book
    Page Numbering Options\u2026 & setting the Page Order = Continue on next even
    page (or next odd page) radio button. That should allow each doc to start on an
    even/odd page regardless of what the last doc ended on. </cite>\r\n\r\nEric, my
    impression is that Ant\xF3nio wants each chapter to start on the whatever page
    (odd or even) makes sequential sense after the previous chapter. But that he wants
    it to change if a previous chapter shifts. \r\n\r\nSo, if a chapter currently
    ends even (on a left page) the next chapter will start on the right (an odd page).
    But then if that chapter gets changed and flows onto another page and then ends
    odd (a right page), the following chapter will automatically shift to begin on
    the next even page (left). And so on throughout the document, shifting back and
    forth as needed.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the perfect situation for a Book file.
    \r\n\r\nI would say that for the situation I described, then you want to set Book
    > Book Page Numbering Options\u2026 to be \"Page Order: Continue from previous
    document\" and also turn on \"Automatic Pagination\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's
    not working for Ant\xF3nio. How did you set up your Book file? Did you generate
    all the chapter documents and then assemble them into a Book at the end? Or did
    you assemble them chapter by chapter as you created the documents? \r\n\r\nYou're
    using Automatic Pagination, right? If you're manually setting the start page for
    each chapter, then that could be messing up the Book synchronization. So, if your
    Chapter 1 ends on page 25, and you manually start the next chapter (document)
    on page 26, and then if the first chapter reflows and adds another page (pg. 26),
    your book will have two page 26s -- one at the end of Chapter 1 and another at
    the beginning of Chapter 2.\r\n\r\nIs this what's happening?\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "Ant\xF3nio --\r\n\r\nI think the problem is indeed that you have each chapter
    starting with unique page numbering 2.1, 2.2, etc. \r\n\r\nAs you know, a book
    typically has odd pages on the left and even on the right, and I think the Book
    feature assumes this. So if you force each chapter to restart numbering with page
    1, then the Book will force it to start right each time.\r\n\r\nUsually this kind
    of scheme (1.1, 1.2 \u2026 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 \u2026) will only open on the right,
    using blank pages if necessary to fill out each chapter to end left. I think I've
    only really seen this scheme used in manuals.\r\n\r\nGiven this style of page
    numbering, then I don't think you can get InDesign to do what you want in terms
    of automatically shifting the chapter starts right and left.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
