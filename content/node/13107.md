  up for sharing a room at <a href=\"http://www.atypi.org/07_Helsinki/50_accommodation\"
  target=\"new\">Sokos Hotel Presidentti</a>, the ATypI Congress Hotel?\r\n\r\nI'm
  arriving Thursday morning September 15th and leaving Sunday evening September 18th."

    A few other fellow brazilian typophiles might possibly be maybe going too, and
    if we find ourselves missing a roommate I'll tell everyone what a fast and precise
    type identifier you are. \r\n\r\nSorry, I didn't solve your problem at all (for
    now), but we could turn this into a \"Who's Going to Helsinki\" thread. But maybe
    there already is a thread like that."

    those come in very handy when you're staying in a foreign city. ;-) <em>We don't
    understand a word, but at least we know which type it is set in.</em> :-D\r\n"
