  marks (or whatever they are called) to print the registration number. I included
  some sample photos. It will be used very small so I don't feel like doing a custom
  font, something in the same vein will do.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/skattemarke.jpg]"

  body: "I may be mistaken, but I thought we had a policy of not getting involved
    in IDing type from 'official document' serial numbers, or currency. We did not
    want to accidentally help with document forgery, if we could avoid it. I'm not
    saying that's your purpose, but I think we should be careful about making it easy
    to copy government documents.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You're right Mike, but we take these on a case by case basis. In this instance
    it is (a) quite hard to forge a license plate due to the manufacturing process
    involved and (b) letters and numbers on license plates have nothing in common
    with typefaces or fonts as we know them. For more information please read my article
    on license plate fonts on <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=57">Unzipped</a>,
    my blog.

  body: "OK, I can see your point Mike.\r\n\r\nYves: The letters in the pictures is
    not the ones that are punched out, but are located on a sticker on the licens
    plate. Probably a custom font just the same tho.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/show_5708.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
    anyway.\r\n"

  body: Yeah, printed serial numbers on official documents and stickers are also often
    specific to the printing device -- especially the blocky pixel kind. You can find
    similar stuff here and there though.
