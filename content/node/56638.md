  Warnock is close, but I'm open to a classy sans-serif as well.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?

  body: "Well, one thought. Since you've picked the \"heading\" font first & are trying
    to find a text font to match, it seems the headings are more important than the
    text.  Odd, but I suppose it happens in a \"branding\" situation.\r\n\r\nIf the
    size difference between the heads and the text is big enough, most any text font
    will work. Over the years, I've seen slabs paired successfully with most text
    fonts. If size alone isn't quite enough to blur a perceived infelicity, use weight.
    A bold or extra bold slab doesn't really \"blend\" with any text font -- except
    perhaps a slab from the same family -- so there is no real conflict. And if just
    the right weight isn't available, you can use the slightly too heavy one & screen
    it back a bit."
