body: "\"CJKV Information Processing\" Second Edition was published late last month,
  and is just getting into distribution channels. See: [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/]]\r\n\r\nThe
  back cover includes a nice quote from Dr. John Warnock, and its Foreword was written
  by my good friend Robert Bringhurst.\r\n\r\nI received the first two copies on Christmas
  Eve, which were overnighted to me from the printer on the 23rd."
