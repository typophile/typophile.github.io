body: "I have been reading a nice old edition of The Sun Also Rises, by Hemingway.
  The printing has a peculiar effect, to my eye, which I'm trying to understand.\r\n\r\nNamely,
  this: the type appears somewhat grayish,like a 60% or 70% gray, consistently throughout
  the book. Looking at the title page and the chapter heads, where the strokes are
  a bit wider, I can see it is slightly uneven, and also that the very edges of the
  letters are slightly crisper and darker. It gives a feeling of letterpress, although
  I'm sure it wasn't printed that way. Certainly there is no impression as would be
  left by a heavy press. And anyway, it is a mass-produced edition. The text is very
  pleasant because of this color.\r\n\r\nHow might this have been printed? With what
  technology, I mean? Something that would leave those crisp edges but not any depressions
  in the paper surface. Would the ink have faded, or was it always so gray?\r\n\r\nIt
  comes from Charles Scribner's Sons in the USA. It doesn't have a page of library
  data (to my surprise) but it does say the copyright was renewed by the author in
  1954. I would imagine it was printed sometime within the 10 years following that.\r\n\r\nIt
  doesn't matter, but to shore up the account: the typeface is something very much
  like Caledonia, although I haven't detected the exact variant, and I think the entire
  book is in the one face\u2014title page and all. There's no colophon or anything
  of ceremony. There appears to be some sticky matter on the inside front cover and
  first leaf, as if it has been a library book or something\u2014but it's very well-preserved
  if it was ever in a library."

  body: "Actually, if it was printed in proximity to 1954 it could still be letterpress.
    Trade books were printed by letterpress into the 1960s. I don\u2019t recall exactly
    when offset lithography took over as the norm, but this Hemingway edition sounds
    like it would have come out in the transition period.\r\n\r\nThe Library of Congress
    didn\u2019t introduce the Cataloging-in-Publication data system until around 1971,
    so the lack of library data doesn\u2019t necessarily help narrow things down.\r\n\r\nThe
    lack of any noticeable impression does not rule out letterpress. Traditionally,
    the goal of a trade printer was a \u201Ckiss\u201D impression; the deep impression
    favored in today\u2019s trends was considered off-standard workmanship back in
    the day.\r\n\r\nBut usually letterpress run with thin ink on hard paper creates
    an impression that\u2019s slightly darker in the middle and gray at the edges,
    not the other way around. \r\n\r\nAndreas may be right that this is a mousy offset
    printing, and that an inferior, thin ink has pooled at the edges. \r\n\r\nA good
    closeup scan might help determine more definitively.\r\n"

    is the process used by LIFE and National Geographic.

  body: "Nick \u2014 The O.P. described \u201Cthe very edges of the letters are slightly
    crisper and darker,\u201D and it is the latter characterization that is a little
    confusing. Usually any slight pooling pulled toward the middle as the paper left
    the type surface, as exhibited in your example, and thus slightly grayer around
    the edges, not darker. \r\n\r\nAlthough, come to think of it, there is sometimes
    that very slight edge definition, as seen along the inside upper right on the
    counter of the \u2018D\u2019 in your example. Maybe that\u2019s the \u201Cdarker\u201D
    that he\u2019s referencing. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "You may be looking at some poor letterpress printing. If the printer didn't
    get the impression or the ink density quite right, the ink may have spread too
    thin on the face of the letters, creating the grayish, uneven color you describe,
    and excess ink may have been squeezed out to form the slightly darker edges. \r\n\r\nThat
    may also explain why it's almost Caledonia but not an exact match. If ink were
    squeezed to the edges, all the letters would appear slightly heavier. In a face
    like Caledonia, which has a high contrast between thick and thin strokes, the
    ink spread would have a dramatically greater effect on the hairline strokes than
    on the thick strokes, making it look a lot less Caledonian. "

  body: "Hi folks, sorry for the long pause. And thanks for your answers, which were
    edifying. Nick's example is interesting, and although it looks different, it does
    show a crisp edge.\r\n\r\nHere's a scan of a chapter head. When I saw this magnification
    I could barely believe just how pronounced the effect is. Doesn't it almost look
    like there is an extra hairline printing around the edge?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sar_6576.png]\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it is a case of thin ink being squeezed to the edges, as Mojo suggested."

    edition was printed in.\r\n\r\nIt's spooky, because the image given there has
    a different typeface than my edition (for one thing, that question mark is completely
    different), but has exactly the same line breaks; and it has the small-caps heading
    and \"THE END\" in just about the same position. Yet, the page break does not
    fall in the same place! My final page starts with \"Down-stairs...\" Spooky..."
