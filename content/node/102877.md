body: "It has occurred to me that moderating the posts of new users would not be too
  onerous a restriction to impose for this forum... <em>with one important exception</em>.\r\n\r\nBut
  making that exception would help solve <em>another</em> problem this forum has,
  in addition to the spam problem.\r\n\r\nSo here's my modest proposal:\r\n\r\nNew
  users would see their posts await approval before appearing on the forum - usually,
  only the first post would need to be so delayed - <em>except if they're posting
  to one of the Type ID boards</em>.\r\n\r\nBecause if you want a Type ID, you may
  be in a hurry. And this would be of a huge benefit in keeping the Type ID requests
  in the right place!\r\n\r\nSo, as I said - two birds with one stone."

    in type ID requests.

  body: Good idea, but I believe the problem lies not with coming up with workable
    improvement ideas (of which there's plenty), but rather with implementing any
    of them. There doesn't seem to be any dev resources on Punchcut's end, not even
    for something as simple as moving Type-ID forum to the top.

    than just Jared, Dean and me to be checking / approving a queue of posts. I figure
    something like a half dozen or so around planet Earth should do.\r\n\r\nType ID
    request showing up everywhere all over, I was thinking we could create a filter
    that would be 'trained' to redirect a Type ID request to the Type ID forum. I
    have notice that most every Type ID request has key words in them such as >>>
    help, does anyone, please identify, <<< etc.. Spam filters use word recognition
    so I don't see why we couldn't do the same for a Type Id filter?  "

  body: "I had assumed - but I don't know either - that the number of legitimate posts
    from new accounts was not only small, but that the vast majority of them were
    type IDs, which, by this scheme, the moderators would not see and not have to
    process (if they were correctly directed - and my goal was that they <em>would</em>
    be correctly directed because of the desire to avoid the delay imposed by the
    moderation queue).\r\n\r\nOf course, the moderators would also have to see and
    reject the posts that they block as well."

    give an accurate number.\r\n\r\nquadibloc, I'm for anything that works so ya lets
    do whatever works. Besides if we try several methods what's there to lose?  And

    weed out most of the spam so the number of first-time posts to review each day
    wouldn't be that huge, but I don't really know for sure as there are some forums
    at Typophile that I don't read."

  body: "If I had to guess, I'd say that between 0-5 new users accounts per day are
    generated outside of the Type ID request new user accounts. \r\n\r\nNew user accounts
    for Type ID show up in the General, Blogs, and some in Design forums. Outside
    of Type ID new user accounts I'd guess that between 0-5 new user accounts are
    generated everyday.\r\n\r\nSo if that is about all, then I'm guessing that a 24hour
    account approval period would not realize all that much of a drop in overall forum
    activity ...maybe?"

    have changed with the new spam filters, but back when I used to deal with some
    of this, Typophile was getting around 100\u2013200 new accounts in a 24-hour period.
    These were mostly what I call \u201Csleeper\u201D spam accounts \u2013 dummy accounts
    with spam links in profile fields. And sometimes one of these \u201Cusers\u201D
    would surface after several months (or even a year) and post a spam thread. "

  body: But then most of those accounts would not be seen by moderators. My proposal
    was that one's first post to a non-Type ID board would be moderated, and so the
    account would be hit when it tries to post something.
