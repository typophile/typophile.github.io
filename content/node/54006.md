  body: "Ah!\r\n\r\n\"we are all taking Graphic Design and Typography at Loyola U
    and our teachers are grading us on our Typophile blogs\"\r\n\r\nWell, it'd be
    nice if the professor, at the very least, made an introduction first. \r\n\r\nHard
    to knock N.O. or cool signage, but it's beginning to feel spammy."

    information to everyone, rather it can be a place for people to collaborate on
    projects, large or small. It was actually one of the original intentions behind
    the site. \r\n\r\nOf course some context would be great for the outsiders, but
    it is an interesting way to encourage participation with the community at large."

    taking place at Typophile. :)

  body: yeah, if you think typophile is New Orleans heavy, why not post more from
    somewhere else?

  body: I was wondering why all that stuff was suddenly appearing sans explanation.
    Your blogs would be more interesting if you dumped all the photos into a Flickr
    pool and discussed your favorites in the blog.

    I've seen teachers do this before...set up a rather inane assignment having kids
    post stuff to a variety of community sites. Typically, the students spend a few
    weeks posting mediocre stuff just to get the grade, and then never show up again.\r\n\r\nCommunity
    sites usually don't benefit a whole lot from forced participation. ;o)\r\n\r\n"
