  on this logo: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4279.jpg"
  alt="rohr"> <BR> <BR>Now, I realize that the &#34;R&#34; in the circle-r device
  is Arial Black and the logotype is in Frutiger. I have yet to resolve the issue
  since I don&#39;t particularly like the rounded tail on the Frutiger &#34;R&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m more interested in is a critique of the basic idea itself.
  Are there existing logos out there that are very similar? Is it just plain a bad
  idea or iffy execution? <BR> <BR>And if you&#39;d care to peep the site itself,
  you may find it at <a href="http://www.famished.org/rohr" target="_blank">www.famished.org/rohr</a>
  until the client gets his domain name. <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

    name. You may have to resize and reposition the  <BR>circle to make it work, but
    the logo will be more unified.

  body: 'Is it just me, or does this logo look like it&#39;s set in Helvetica? And
    the R in the circle is more like Akzidenz Grotesk. I&#39;m a bit confused here.
    <BR> <BR>Another way of going at it would be to center name, circle and &#34;R&#34;.
    And by centering, I mean center mathematically along the horizontal axis and then
    adjust optically. <BR>Then you might wanna print out both versions &#40;Stephen&#39;s
    suggestion and mine&#41; at the same size and look at them from a distance. You&#39;ll
    notice that in Stephen&#39;s version the circle will be higher up, but the common
    baseline will give it a sense of stability and sturdiness, whereas mine will have
    a more  horizontal dynamic. It&#39;s your personal preference which will make
    you go for one version or another, as I think both are valid solutions. <BR> <BR>P.S.
    When you decide to opt for Helvetica for the logo, bear in mind that half the
    world and their sister&#39;s logo is set in Helvetica. Ask Erik Spiekermann &#40;<i>Rhyme
    &amp; Reason: A Typographic Novel</i>, pages 100-101&#41;. I&#39;ve got a hunch
    he might be right.'

  body: 'Thanks gang... <BR> <BR>Tanya: Yeah, I wrestled with the circle-r circle-r
    quandry. I suppose I could keep the logo pretty big &#40;1&#34;?&#41; and make
    the registration mark as small as legally possible. <BR> <BR>Yves: I might be
    smoking crack on the Arial-Frutiger thing... either way, they should probably
    be the same typeface. I definitely want a straight tail. I don&#39;t really want
    to use Helvetica, but I am not terribly happy with how other faces look.  <BR>
    <BR>My all-time favorite sans is Interstate but the LC looks like poo. Maybe Champion?'

  body: its generally thought that the bigger the logo the smaller the company. <BR>
    <BR>to avoid making them look ma&amp;pop I wouldn&#39;t increase it anymore. <BR>

  body: Following up on Hrant&#39;s suggestion, you could brak the circle up abit
    and or play around with some different line weights &#40;to differentiate it from
    a registered mark more&#41;.
