  body: "\"I showed them a range of slab serifs produced by French and German foundries
    around 1900-1940, and synthesized elements from several of them (notably Beton,
    Peignot's Egyptienne Noir, Georg Trump's Schadow, and Scarab) into a new face
    with a very large x-height, extremely short ascenders and descenders, and tight
    spacing, for a compact, contemporary look. It was hard at first to keep it away
    from Guardian Egyptian, which I had finished work on only a month earlier, but
    I think it evolved into its own thing.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe check out some of the others
    mentioned above."
