  bed. Surpise Supriiiise. The impression I have gotten on Typophile is that InDesign
  probably the top tool and most ideal software tool in which to test today. I am
  BTW not saying that it is not important to test in the less optimal environments.
  Instead, I am asking what you guys think is the best or most ideal.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    that it doesn''t fully support Opentype, but it''s got a lot of nice features
    and it''s a bonus that you can test your font, since there are often all sorts
    of issues between Illustrator / InDesign / Photoshop. I''ve moved from Quark last
    year, and I must say I do prefer InDesign now that I''m used to using it. '

    used it since its first version. Now, I won't touch it unless flogged with poison
    Ivy covered barbed wire. \r\nThere are some odd differences in interface between
    Illustrator and InD when working with type but of everything else currently available,
    InD is the best one.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "If you are going to pick one application as your primary test bed, InDesign
    is a fine choice. (Disclaimer: as I work for Adobe, you may consider me to have
    a bias here.)\r\n\r\nWith that being said, there are *many* potential problems
    that can't be uncovered in *any* single application. IMO, anybody doing serious
    retail-quality font development needs to test with multiple applications and operating
    systems.\r\n\r\nI also *strongly* recommend you install the Adobe FDK for OpenType,
    if only to use the CompareFamily tool. It runs a whole bunch of tests and encapsulates
    a lot of Adobe's expert knowledge about OpenType font development testing. Some
    of these tests operate both at the level of the whole, family and some on individual
    fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
