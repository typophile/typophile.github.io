body: "What determines the baseline placement of a particular font within a type bounding
  box, specifically within Illustrator?\r\n\r\nI created a supplement to a particular
  font that is essentially a mark centered within most of the basic characters, basically
  an oversized bullet point with all other glyphs blank.\r\n\r\nWhen I set the text
  using the basic text tool, copy and paste a version in place on top and switch to
  said supplement font everything lines up and is in sync, yet when I do the same
  thing within a type bounding box the supplement font shifts upward to where the
  top of the bounding box is flush with the height of the character. (Even with the
  version I just exported that uses the original fonts key dimensions, x-height, caps-height
  etc., so it must not read off of those dimensions for the baseline placement)\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what Illustrator's type bounding box is reading off of that causes the font
  to shift upwards?\r\n\r\nThanks"
