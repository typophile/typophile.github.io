  body: "The Romans are a bit casual -- compared with western versions of these designs.\r\nHowever,
    this quality matches the looseness of the Greek characters, especially in the
    Bodoni, which is quite charming, and easily my favorite of the group.\r\n\r\nThe
    Didot is a nice \"big kappa-height\" version of the famous Monotype 90.\r\nThe
    latin italic is a bit too close to its source, Palatino.\r\n\r\nOlga (based on
    Porson) is, for me, the least successful: forcing the characters into the \"italic\"
    mode has made several of them cramped; Austin's original had a nice variety of
    stress angle (the lamda, for instance, and the capitals, being upright, not slanted).\r\n\r\nAll
    the fonts (except Olga) have an awesome character set, including nut fractions!\r\nLove
    those small caps, which GFS uses to nice effect on the back page of the PDF brochures.\r\n\r\nOn
    a technical point: I notice that these fonts have \"capital-with-iota-subscript\"
    letters with the iota under the letter, rather than following it, as is the norm
    with Adobe fonts and Gentium. \r\n"
