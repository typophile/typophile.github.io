  problems with his computer as he can't change the font face of the Chinese text.
  He says that it's because he can't activate the font even though he downloaded the
  fonts. We're kinda lost here and hope anyone here can help?\r\n\r\nHope I've posted
  in the right forum too:)\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "In addition, we're looking for simplified Chinese fonts that don't look \"block-ish\".
    As in, Comic sans is to Times New Roman:) kinda more rounded corners and a less
    serious feeling.. \r\n\r\np.s. my designer doesn't understand Chinese x( thus,
    if you have any recommendation of fonts, do let us know.\r\n\r\nThanks."
