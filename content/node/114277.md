    the price?\r\nGood luck with it."

  body: "Martin: \r\nThanks, I will tell the type designer about it so he can adjust
    kerning better.\r\n\r\nAndreas: \r\nYes, I know what you mean. But it's just a
    marketing strategy, this year we decided to live only from type design, so as
    a new commercial type foundry we have to adapt to the market and what our target
    is willing to pay. We all know that prices in type design are dropping, but that
    does not mean that the type designer is winning less money, I think that's the
    other way around. Now people from more corners of the world are able to buy fonts,
    due to the lower prices. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess that when you have a long and
    outstanding career in type design and are well established, like: Hoefler & Frere-Jones,
    Peter Bil'ak, Luc(as) de Groot, etc... you are able to sell your fonts at a higher
    price and people will buy it happily because they appreciate the difference. But
    I guess we (Tipotype) are far from it right now. I hope someday we can have the
    proper economic stability to have the right time to create excellent quality typography.
    \r\n \r\nKind regards from Montevideo, Uruguay."

  body: "Fernando,\r\nI see the point, of course. And I honestly wish you success
    with this typeface and others to come. But the problem with such huge discounts
    is, you somewhat give an impression that you\u2019re not entirely confident in
    your product\u2019s value for money. There has been much debate about this trend:
    60% off, 80%off, 90% off \u2026 and then? Then we have distroyed our market and
    made type being held for crap.\r\nInstead of a panic-discounting you could consider
    to generally price your packages a bit lower, or to bundle special value packages.
    Make an introductory discount of 20% or 30% and then keep the normal modest rates,
    so you will be noted as a serious type supplier \u2013 this will help you to establish
    a fruitful customer relations and generate reasonable revenue over a long time.\r\n
    I use this marketing instrument myself, from time to time. If I recall correctly,
    I did not go beyond 25% so far. Everything else I would feel just bad about, and
    it actually won\u2019t raise the sales.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry, Rufina is a very
    handsome typeface, it will find its way and reward you.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Greetings
    from Leipzig."

    purchaser <strong>is not</strong> allowed to modify or alter the font software
    without permission. However, under no circumstances may the resulting work be
    for resale or further distribution.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). But
    just a little further down\r\n\r\n<blockquote>7. Modifying font outlines <strong>is</strong>
    allowed. (modifying outlines, new signs, alter spacing, change format, etc) only
    for its own personal or professional use. The purchaser is responsible for securing
    this data and making sure that unlicensed copies do not leave his/her possession.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm
    confused (easily done).\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I read your font embedding policy,
    it's OK to embed fonts in a PDF if the font is obfuscated -- just like Adobe &
    FontFont's policy; unlike the Monotype conglomeration policy. That right?"

    and fix this errors, thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nWhat it means is that you can modify
    the outlines, format, and add signs, etc... if it's for personal or comercial
    use, but, It's just for you, you cannot deliver the file to your client, for example.
    \r\nAnd yes, it's OK to embed fonts in the PDF.\r\n\r\nThank you and sorry for
    the trouble!"
