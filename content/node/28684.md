body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Publications]] : The Building Letters Project</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  project Building Letters was launched in 2003 by [[Jim Richardson]]. The profits
  from the sales of 36-page magazine on African design were donated to the support
  of two African orphanages for children with AIDS. The success of the project was
  boosted by the CD with free fonts created, amongst others, by [[Max Kisman]] or
  [[David Carson]]. Second issue was dedicated to India, and the profits went to the
  aid of Indian children and of children from a Ugandan orphanage. Again, the issue
  contained a CD with fonts designed by [[Donald Beekman]], [[Bruno Maag]], Rian Hughes
  and others. Jim begun working on the third issue shortly after the deadly tsunami
  in 2004 on the impulse of Rathna Ramanathan from the University of Reading, who
  was at Sri Lanka when the tsunami came.\r\n\r\n<strong>Building Letters 3</strong>\r\n\r\nShort
  after the call for cooperation on the third issue was published, [[Filip Blazek|Filip
  Bla\u017Eek]] from Prague-based design studio [[Designiq]] offered to do free layout
  and typesetting of the whole issue, and Jim immediately accepted this offer. First
  version of the magazine was ready in February 2005, however, the work was delayed
  for more than a year and half by various obstacles. In the end, Bla\u017Eek and
  Richardson agreed that the final steps of the production and distribution process
  would be left to Designiq. Shortly afterwards, at the Typo Berlin 2006, an international
  team met, helping the new magazine come into the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the first
  half of October, the third issue of Building Letters magazine will come out, being
  a means with which typographers and designers help those in need. By purchasing
  one of the 1000 copies (numbered by hand), you not only receive a CD with 25 fonts
  by renown typographers, you will also make a significant contribution to the aid
  of those whose lives aren't as lucky as yours or mine.\r\n\r\nThe third issue of
  Building Letters is dedicated to Sri Lanka and Thailand, and it features interesting
  articles by Tom de Gay, [[Nick Shinn]], [[Max Kisman]], [[Fiona Ross]] and [[Donald
  Beekman]]. As usual, it contains a CD with free fonts, this time donated by [[Pieter
  van Rosmalen]], Seonil Yun, Jos\xE9 Scaglione, David B\u0159ezina, Jos\xE9 Louis
  Coyotl Mixocatl, [[Stefan Hattenbach]], Bram Pitoyo, Tom\xE1\u0161 Brousil, [[Richard
  Kegler]], [[Veronika Burian]], J\xFCrgen Weltin a Ludmila Lorenz. All fonts are
  [[OpenType]] and with one exception, they contain glyphs necessary for typesetting
  of all Latin-script European languages (complete [[Unicode]] set Latin Extended
  A), so you can set Maltese, Welsh, or Esperanto in them; some faces contain special
  features, alternate glyphs, decorative glyphs, alternative numerals, ligatures,
  or small caps.\r\n\r\nAlthough the TV cameras are long gone from the places hit
  by the tsunami, aid is still needed. This is why all profit from the sales (after
  deduction of hard costs) will be donated to a respected charity Direct Relief International
  (http://www.directrelief.org), which will use the money to help those hit by the
  2004 tsunami.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/building-letters-3-cover_4288.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  magazine size is A5, it has 64 full colour pages, it is published in a limited run
  of 1000 numbered copies, and it is <strong>on sale now for 35 Euro</strong> (aprox.
  $43) at http://www.buildingletters.org. Also, the site will publish information
  on how much money was collected, and finally, it will publish a report from Direct
  Relief on the use of the donation.\r\n"
