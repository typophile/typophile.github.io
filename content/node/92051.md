  options of minion pro, sabon or caslon but have been meaning to try out this beautiful

  someone can give me good advice, thanks. '

    a lot of leading (although some cuts of Walbaum are a bit coarser than the original,
    with less contrast & these are less in need of this). 12 Points may be too small,
    in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSome of the details may be too quirky for the average reader

  body: It's fine as long as you use metal. Otherwise, for offset printing, it's just
    one more classical font gefuched first by photocomp drawings & then PostScript
    digitization. In other words, it badly needs redrawing for current printing technologies,
    save perhaps for print-on-demand books -- I'm no expert on how those inks appear
    on paper.

  body: "As originally developed, didones were size-specific (as indeed were all styles
    at the time), and that is the key to their sophistication: their delicacy is fine-tuned
    to each size, with purposefully small leeway for error in printing. If that takes
    higher quality, more time-consuming press-work, it may indeed be expensive and
    hence upscale, bourgeois and aristocratic, but \uFB01ne printing is not per se
    class-speci\uFB01c, it is the direction in which technology marches..\r\n\r\nIf
    anything, didones were over-sophisticated, as remarked by Richard Austin in his
    Imperial Foundry specimen of 1819:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CThe modern ... printing
    type at present in use was introduced by the French, about twenty years ago: the
    old shaped letters being capable of some improvement, it was judged expedient
    to re-model the alphabet to render them more agreeable to the improved state of
    printing\u2026\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHe went on to address the issue of fragility:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201C\u2026for
    how can it be expected that types cut nearly as thin as the edge of a razor can
    retain their form for any reasonable length of time, either to produce good work,
    or remunerate the Printer for his labour?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CThe
    hair lines being now below the surface of the main strokes of the letters, the
    Printer, in order to get an impression of all parts of the face, is obliged to
    use a softer backing, and additional pressure. This \u2026 militates against all
    good printing; for in forcing the paper down to meet the depressed part of the
    face, it at the same time takes off the impression of part of the sides, as is
    evident from the ragged appearance of printing from such types.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSurely
    the dif\uFB01culty in printing such types properly, and the complexity of their
    construction (with varying height of different glyph parts, according to their
    degree of delicacy) constitutes a sophisticated, i.e. complex, design?\r\n\r\nThe
    didone style was developed for \uFB01ne letterpress typography, and subsequently
    adapted for more general job work and other technologies, in which it does not
    sit quite so easily. It\u2019s dif\uFB01cult to work with, but not impossible.
    No risk, no reward."

  body: It only needs to be legible enough to be read within the constraints of the
    project at hand.  Every use of a typeface is not a roadway sign.  Type is a tool.  We
    use different tools for different jobs.  Any tool can be used very badly.  If
    you give me the worlds best scalpel and ask me to perform brain surgery on you,
    you won't live long enough to fire me or even complain to anyone about how badI
    am at operating.

  body: "Nick, bourgeois and aristocratic are not the same; the former is all pretense.
    And just because something is more difficult to work with does not make it more
    functional. The other thing -which Bert alludes to- is that style is appreciable
    in proportion to size; a Didone is less of a Didone the smaller you get, and below
    a certain threshold is not a Didone at all.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor: Of course. In fact
    there's no such thing as \"highest possible legibility\". But a designer needs
    to know what he's breaking, how and why. For example in Patria I've made the \"s\"
    (among other glyphs) too wide in terms of what I think is optimal readability,
    but I did so to promote a certain style. That's not the same saying \"I made it
    wide coz I like it and that's all that matters.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nToday,

    18th and 19th Century books in small size Didot types, and they are unmistakably
    Didone style. I think you are making the mistake of assuming that Didones are
    characterised by high contrast between hairline and main stems, but that characteristic
    is itself a function of size derived from a particular construction. The whole
    point of a Didone is that the hairline weight remains fairly constant independent
    of size, while the main stem weight varies according to size. So of course smaller
    sizes have lower contrast, <em>but that is precisely because they are Didones.</em>"

    that distinction\u2026 Apart from commendable recent efforts like the ITC Bodoni
    \u2018numbered\u2019 opticals, almost two generations were subjected to one-aspect
    didones for all sizes.\r\n\r\nAnother point I have to make: photoreproduction
    was not very kind to didones and such. The latest technologies in printing, like
    computer-to-plate and high res setting have made it possible to regain the field
    lost since the second world war.\r\n"
