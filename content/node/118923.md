  body: "Again, the  glyphs are straight lines.\r\nLooks like it could be one of theemaciated
    fonts similar to Times that are used for the Latin characters in Asian fonts.
    Fivos & Ryuk have a good track record on finding them. Or it's yet another special
    design used for engraving.\r\nDon"

  body: "The glyph I tested had no curves. If you look at the image I posted you will
    see that it consists of many short straight lines connected in sequence point
    to point.\r\nLook closely at this zoomed portion of the outline: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/G_zoomed_5051.jpg]
    A normal font would show the outline of a script G as a curved line not a series
    of little straight ones.\r\nFor some unexplained reason the outlines in your pdf
    are duplicated, with one being exactly on top of the other. To use the outline
    in a font program you need to get rid of one of the outlines. One way is to use
    the cursor to click on a point, hold the cursor down, and pull the point out of
    the outline, repeat for the next point, etc. etc. Here is an image which shows
    a few of the duplicate points pulled out of the duplicate outline:  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/G_zoomedShowingPulledOutPoints_6480.jpg]\r\nContinue
    until you have pulled out all of the duplicate points. Then delete all of the
    duplicate points. BTW there are other ways of eliminating duplicate points, but
    this is the easiest to explain.\r\nDon"
