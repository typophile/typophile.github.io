  to a studio or lighting so have been relying on natural light and a Nikon D50 and
  its just not looking very good. Anybody got any tips on pulling off a professional
  job with limited equipment, im prepared to invest in a couple of photographic lights
  if really necessary, but would interested in any cheap alternatives.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks \r\n\r\nEd    "

  body: I bought a few lights, shot on white formica, and had pretty good results.
    You can also use white posterboard or foamboard to use as reflectors. You may
    be able to get away with reflectors if there's enough natural light, but a few
    lights will make a big difference. Example below.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4559.jpg]

  body: "On the cheap lighting solutions are much more available now that CFLs are
    becoming common. Look for Daylight rated bulbs like the <a href=\"http://genet.gelighting.com/LightProducts/images/t03/0000003/r03080v29.jpg\">GE
    Energy Smart CFL</a> bulbs. \r\n\r\nYou can get a few of these, and some (2-3)utility
    spot lights (clamp style). \r\n\r\nIf you have a tripod, set up a blank location
    on a wall in a darkened room with a piece of Black or White mat board. Attach
    your work to the mat board and then set up your tripod about 3-6 feet away. using
    2-3 spotlights with your daylight CFLs, aim them so that they're roughly 30-60
    degrees to the artwork and on each side (this will eliminate any glare or shine).
    \r\n\r\nDo a search on Google for Copy Photography. I'm sure there's other useful
    tips, like manual settings.\r\n\r\nIf you live near a college/university, especially
    a liberal arts college, there's always slide photographers available, you might
    even be able to talk your way into the lab to use the copy stand.\r\n\r\nGood
    Luck."

  body: "You want to work outside on a bright overcast day, and with your flash turned
    off, for best results.  Position yourself so that you are on the opposite side
    of the table (where the art is) from the sun (i.e. north in northern hemisphere,
    south in southern).  I've been told you can also get OK shots if you are in full
    shade, but I've not had much luck.\r\n\r\nIf you are photographing small 3D things
    (boxes, etc.) you can build yourself a background out of a cardboard box (with
    two sides cut away, and line it with a dense white, non-reflective cloth or paper
    (I've got a little one made with Hammermill Color Cover stock).\r\n\r\nMy friend
    <a href=\"http://www.albertacraft.ab.ca/pages/exhibits/ab_washington/popwins/harse_01.htm\">Crys
    Harse</a> built herself a 3-foot cube of PVC pipe, some masonite, and white cloth,
    installed two good lights, and takes all of her pictures in that (including the
    one on the site).  It's a pretty reasonable solution pricewise, if you have a
    lot to do.  "

  body: 'One helpful trick is to set up a board on an easel, tape the work to the
    board, and photograph it. Then, take the work down, replace it with white paper
    or fabric, and photograph that. In photoshop invert (cmd-i) the colors in the
    white paper image, and then place it over the image of the work and set its blending
    mode to lighten. This will remove the highlights from the uneven lighting and
    you can then use adjustment layers for further tweaks. '

    \ \r\n\r\nThere are times, however, that touching-up isn't allowed -- I've had
    to take pix of some of my work for competitions where they will only accept original
    RAW files (or unaltered JPG or TIFFs) for jurying and will DQ anything else.  Being
    able to get a good shot in those instances is invaluable."

  body: Edward, I'm not sure what kind of lights they are (not even sure where they
    are at the moment), but they were a cheap set. Cost maybe $150 for 2 lights with
    stands and reflector/diffusor umbrellas. I'm a total noob at lights, and prefer
    natural light myself. They weren't strobes, so they were on all the time (which
    got hot). They did make a big difference though.

  body: "I shoot with a D50 also, and I own the f/1.8 50mm prime. It's slightly longer
    than what people consider a \"normal\" lens, so it's great for portrait photography.
    Not really applicable here... but it's my favorite lens. \r\n\r\nCopy-stand work
    becomes more complex if you're photographing three dimensional objects of design
    work that has texture. For example, a painting can look very different depending
    on the angle and quality of light applied to it, which is why good copy-stand
    work is it's own peculiar specialty. \r\n\r\nI would take some of the previous
    advice and focus on applying diffused, even light. If you want everything in focus,
    secure the camera and shoot around f/8 or f/11. Most lenses are their sharpest
    in that range."

  body: Another option that's worked out for me is an off-camera flash with big reflectors.
    It's cheaper than studio lights, and it's nice to have a decent flash anyway.
    In my case I use a Nikon SB-600.
