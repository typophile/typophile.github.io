  body: Considering there's only few letters, could be a custom based on an existing
    typeface. [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|HTF
    Knockout no26 Flyweight]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/newhouse-dt/super-condensed/|DT
    Newhouse Super Condensed]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/reforma-grotesk-bold-e/reforma-grotesk-medium/|Reforma
    Grotesk Medium]] could easily do the job (manually lowering crossbars and chunking
    some terminals).

  body: The shapes of the S and W closely match Knockout Flyweight, and the proportions
    and spacing there are all pretty dead-on; I'd say that's your answer.
