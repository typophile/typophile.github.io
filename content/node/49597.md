  body: Henry Hughes created three fonts inspired by Saul Bass's lettering back in
    2002. His old website is defunct, but I found them <a href="http://communication.utsa.edu/mbatch/3413/site2x/lhughes/freebies.html"

    few years back I had the opportunity to repackage the book the \"Anatomy of a
    Murder\" movie was based on. At the time, a design with <A HREF=\"http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516H559HXKL._SL500_BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Murder-Robert-Traver/dp/0312033567&h=240&w=240&sz=18&hl=en&start=14&um=1&usg=__qCGstDjzRmOkhFVlM9-OcWjhnPs=&tbnid=pakdg6cy51D5SM:&tbnh=110&tbnw=110&prev=/images%3Fq%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmurder%2Bst.%2Bmartin%2527s%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us%26sa%3DN\">no
    resemblance</A> to Saul Bass' iconic poster was in place. I pushed to revert back
    to using Saul Bass's iconic movie poster image <A HREF=\"http://www.designrelated.com/portfolio/Karen/page/6/entry/6587/\">on
    the cover</A>. And when I needed to add the \"#1 Bestseller\" line I found the
    font <A HREF=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/hatmaker/\">Hatmaker</A> to be
    the closest match I could find at the time. Not perfect--but a similar feel. (And
    <A HREF=\"http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/images/A1319980216130350.jpg\">just
    for for fun</A> here is the package for the first edition of the book back in
    1958)"
