body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm involved in designing a logo for a research group that is going
  to be established soon. The research is in a field somewhere between natural sciences
  and their application in engineering. It's about the opposite of an art exhibition
  or a virtual social network internet site, so there is not much room for eccentric
  ideas.\r\n\r\nThere are now two basic choices, and slight changes to the design
  are still possible. Can anyone help me to decide between the two variants? Thank
  you!!\r\n\r\nA)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-block-4c_3647.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-block-sw_3627.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nB)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-right-4c_6191.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-right-sw_5746.png]"

    size. Color-wise - single color. \r\n\r\nHowever I would reconsider using the
    lowercase as it seems a bit too (artificially) friendly and playful for something
    that fits your brief. Or I would try getting rid of /i/s dot, see if it works.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    M-O is a bit too loose.\r\n"

    is a play on gathering information?\r\nWhile I like the concept, it makes me wanna

  body: Agreed on the all lowercase seeing too friendly. In riccard0's sketch there
    is at least a bit more of a sense of the technical to it though.

  body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nThank you all very much for the great comments and ideas!!
    We need to discuss all this in our group, so I'll give a somewhat more detailed
    response later on. \r\n\r\nWe had discussed using the font Insignia, but it appeared
    to much oriented towards art, not science. Especially with the \"s\" in the font
    of riccard0's example, the appearance is different. Block letters look somewhat
    too much like engineering, but that also probably depends a lot on the specific
    font that is being used. \r\n\r\nSorry for the m-o gap. We knew the logo would
    need some work once we settle for a specific design, but it's very helpful to
    know where this work is most urgent.\r\n\r\n\"i\" is an abbreviation for \"Instabilities\"
    (we are not dealing with information in the sense used in computer sciences or
    with regard to databases).\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to following, and participating
    in, the ongoing discussion.\r\n\r\ncschroeppel\r\n\r\n"

    would it be too playful to try and play with that?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mismo_5950.gif]\r\n(Very
    quick and dirty, hope you don't mind!)"
