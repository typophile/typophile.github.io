body: "I'm a lawyer trying to decide on typefaces to use in my legal practice.\r\n\r\nSo
  you understand when I'm coming from: I learned some very basic typography back in
  college when I edited a publication (e.g. use one space instead of two after a period,
  when to use em dashes instead of hyphens, use italics instead of underlining, use
  serif fonts for text\u2014I've read way too many lengthy legal briefs that my opponent
  has set in Arial!), but lost interest for years and have only recently started trying
  to really control the type and make the document look good. Basically, I don't want
  a judge to pick up my brief and dread reading it because it looks awful.\r\n\r\nAs
  for font selection, my university was Mac-centric back in the late 80's/early 90's,
  and we had the standard LaserWriter fonts at our disposal. I, along with just about
  everyone else, used Palatino for term papers, and we used ITC Bookman (my first
  love, though I now understand why MT Bookman Old Style is preferred) and Helvetica
  in our publication. When I finished law school, I was suddenly thrust into the Windows
  world and didn't have Palatino or Bookman at my disposal. I had to find something
  new, and, the legal world being conformist, I started using Times New Roman. I didn't
  think twice about it for 10 years.\r\n\r\nI now understand that Times is too narrow
  to use with 8.5 by 11 paper and was digitized from a headline size, so I want to
  get away from it. I've been looking around at different typefaces for the last few
  months. So far, I'm happy with Bitstream's Classical Garamond (i.e. Sabon) for use
  in legal briefs, where I want the text to look distinguished and a bit weighty.
  (I have an old copy of WordPerfect with most of the Bitstream library, by the way.)
  However, for everyday correspondence, I think it's a little too elegant; I'm looking
  for something a little more business-like.\r\n\r\nI've considered going back to
  good old Palatino. I've also considered BT's Aldine 721 because it isn't too far
  afield from Times but is a bit wider (even though I've read somewhere that it's
  narrower than \"real\" Plantin). It seems like Minion is well respected as a workhorse
  typeface around here, but, realizing that I'm stuck with 8.5x11 paper and a wide
  measure, it's too narrow\u2014with kerning on, you get even more characters per
  line than Times New Roman. Anything else that I should look at? I don't mind spending
  a few bucks to get it right.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help. I've been lurking
  here for a few months and I'm very impressed with the knowledge level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One thing you mention but don't explore is text block on your letter. Manipulating
    the width of that will allow you to use a more efficiently spaced type like Minion
    without sacrificing legibility due to the unweildy line-length.\r\n\r\nI'm a European,
    and so use the standardised paper sizes rather than US letter size, which I assume
    you'll be using. A4 is more rectangular, and therefore probably more easy to work
    with than US letter, but neither is a truly appreciable shape on which to set
    type. One trick might be to set your block to a known, respected shape like a
    golden section or a hexagonal calculation. That way you can mitigate the clumsy
    paper shape with your type set in a respectable block.\r\n\r\nA quick cheat I
    use regularly (on A4) is to set a wide left margin. It's not measured, but the
    asymmetry and shorter line-length work almost immediately. Liberate yourself from
    the paper size! If you want more information, Bringhurst has a great discussion
    of the text block in his book, <em>The Elements of Typographic Style.</em>\r\n\r\nIf
    you think through the design of your letter I think you'll have an easier time
    finding the right face to express your missives."

    721</a> (i.e. the Bitstream revival of the Plantin face). It has somewhat similar
    proportions to Times but better color. It's very neutral and legible. And many
    people won't notice it as a \"non-default\" face. \r\n\r\nA."

    more beautiful italic than regular Times. And most correspondents you use it with

  body: "Sabon has always struck me as a better correspondence typeface than briefing
    typeface, so if you like it for briefs, you might like it for correspondence as
    well.  I tend to like Palatino better.  Palatino's vertical spacing using \"single
    spacing\" on a word processor is greater than Sabon's, though.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion,
    however, is that you go to ebay, and buy yourself a new copy of WordPerfect 8
    (yes, from the '90s), generally available for ten bucks or less.  It comes with
    a HUGE number of Bitstream typefaces (something on the order of 1000), including
    clones of many you might want to consider.  I've spent a lot of money on fonts
    that seemed ideal for legal work, but that turned out not to be for reasons that
    just weren't evident at first glance.  Then do up a few sample documents, and
    try out a bunch of the fonts that you think might be suitable.  Not everything
    you might be considering will be there, but believe me, it's a royal pain to spend
    money on an expensive font that turns out to be unsuitable unsuitable for some
    obscure reason (e.g., the weird pilcrow in Le Monde Livre).  I really like Dolly's
    color and cleverness, for example, but the friggin' figures.  Aaargh!  It cost
    me about 450 bucks for a 5-user license--that was an expensive lesson.  And there
    are more expensive fonts, such as those from DTL.  If I hit Powerball I might
    buy some DTL fonts. <g>\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with many of the newest fonts,
    including most of the new Microsoft fonts that come with Vista and/or Office 2007
    (e.g., the very legible and nicely done Constantia), is the current vogue for
    old style figures as the default figures.  For a lot of legal work those simply
    won't do, although there may be some types of law practice for which OSF are perfectly
    okay.  With few, if any, exceptions, the Bitstream fonts on the WordPerfect 8
    CD don't have that problem.\r\n\r\nOne last hint:  if you're using Microsoft Word
    2003 or later, TURN OFF THE EXPLETIVE DELETED ORDINALS SUPERSCRIPTING, and pick
    the WordPerfect-style justification if you're gonna right-justify.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Supposedly, old style figures are more legible, which is why a a test of
    legibility (for on-screen, though) showed both the serif 2007 fonts showed greater
    legibility than Times New Roman, measuring by number of mix ups. Cambria showed
    the lowest percentage of mistakes overall, but most likely because the number
    recognition in Constantia was incredibly low, most likely do to the fact that
    people are unfamiliar to that style of number. In letters, which make up the bulk
    of what is on most pages, though, Constantia was the best, which I think makes
    it superior (besides, I like old-style numbers, even putting numbers in Georgia
    in TNR text).\r\n\r\nHere it is: [[http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/81/legibility.htm]]"

    block, but unfortunately, I don't control my law firm's stationery, and given
    the design, large margins would look awkward.\r\n\r\npeter.ricardo: I'm aware
    of Times Ten and will give it a look. I have Dutch 801 in the Bitstream library;
    I seem to remember reading that it's based on Times Ten, not Times New Roman.
    Can anyone confirm this? It certainly isn't as condensed as TNR. And I assume
    Dutch 801 Headline is Times 18?\r\n\r\nQuincunx: I'm open to a 21st century font.
    Among those mentioned in the thread that I've looked at and liked are Dolly, Arnhem,
    and Miller. Arnhem struck me as the most appropriate, but it's hard to tell from
    a screen sample. Does anyone have any experience with it in a business setting?\r\n\r\nRe:
    Old style numerals: I think someone suggested in the other legal thread (the one
    sii posted) that they're OK for text but you definitely don't want to use them
    in legal style citations, which makes sense to me. Of course, if you're going
    to use both lining and old style, you need a program that supports OpenType, which
    rules out Word and WordPerfect, i.e., what most lawyers use. (My firm has both.)
    I guess that I'd have to stick with lining numerals for everything until Microsoft
    and Corel finally get with the times and incorporate OpenType. (I have Apple Pages
    at home, so no problem there.)\r\n\r\nAnd while we're still on the subject of
    Sabon...can anyone recommend a good sans to use for headers? I've tried Optima,
    but I'm open to other suggestions...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you'll find that something more vanilla than Optima will work better,
    but even then pairing a sans with a serifed font is tricky in legal work--it tends
    to look a bit weird, since almost nobody does it, and judges/lawyers/clients aren't
    used to seeing it.  Try experimenting first with \"free\" alternatives such as
    Corbel and Segoe, or the Bitstream Clone of Frutiger, Humanist 777, if you have
    that.  Anything but Arial. <g>  Corbel would be my first choice, since it's beautifully
    clean and matches Sabon in x-height, but the OSF in Corbel may give you problems.\r\n\r\nI
    assume by \"headers\" you mean headings or subheadings such as \"Argument and
    Authorities\" or \"2.  XYZ Corp. probably does not have a colorable fraud claim.\""

    if I absolutely had had to use one, producing a list that you might want to look
    at.\r\n\r\nFor old style figures, why don't you just use a different font for
    numbers outside of text? Cambria might be close enough to Constantia that its
    numbers could be switched as long as the numbers in one font aren't in the middle
    of text in the other."
