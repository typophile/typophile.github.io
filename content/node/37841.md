  some text in Baltic languages with it (thankfully shortish ones). It's apparently
  \ a free font.\r\n\r\nIs there a (commercial) version of this font with all the
  Baltic glyphs readily available, or do I have to make do with combinations? Which
  brings me to the next question, is there any better way in InDesign or Illustrator
  to add the tails etc to the letters than extensive kerning?\r\n\r\nSorry for the
  lack of correct terms, I mean this\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/continuum_u_6575.jpg]"
