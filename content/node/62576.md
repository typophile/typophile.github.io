  also interested in the bad spacing but I guess I could\r\nset this myself.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJames\r\n"

    expect NASA used a deliberately quirky font for that back in the 1970s? :-)\r\nTry

    close. As I look at the two versions of letter gothic I have: Letter Gothic 12
    Pitch BT & Letter Gothic Std they both seem sharper than the NASA version. Perhaps
    this is a result of the production and reproduction process? Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks"
