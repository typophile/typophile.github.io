  body: "Excellent Charles! \r\nI especially like it in those soft colors too. The
    ending \"e\". which hangs kinda looser than the rest works really well."

  body: "Good stuff!\r\n\r\nI only which that the \"g\" and \"n\" would be connected
    or at least almost connected, otherwise perfect.\r\n\r\nLong live lettering!"

    </em>\r\n\r\nSurely the disconnect is to hint at the separate word \"nature\"
    contained within the brand name? -- Especially in monochrome situations."

  body: Stefan - but the break between the g and n help the eye to realize the "nature"
    emphasis in the design! It breaks the word into 2 but in a natural but subtly
    noticeable way. Great work Charles!

  body: "Truly beautiful Charles.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me how you produced it? I have
    always wondered how such caligraphic scripts are made with those varying widths.
    Would you sketch and then scan and then use illustrator? What is the best way
    to do that in illustrator?\r\n\r\nSorry if my questions seem novice but I really
    would love an insight.\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "Thanks Guys!\r\n\r\nJay,\r\n\r\nGreat question! The piece was lettered first
    on tracing paper for its smooth finish. A technique I learned from Stephen Rapp.
    Then I scanned it in and traced it in Illustrator CS3. I have to admit I did a
    lot of cleanup on this logo and it shows. I am still a novice when it comes to
    the wonderful world of lettering. :)\r\n\r\nHave a great weekend,\r\n\r\n-Charles

  body: Because of the love-fest I tried to find some holes to knock in it, but this
    logo is pretty damn solid! Congratulations on a job well done.
