body: Is there a Quark XT for Hebrew layouts? I created a booklet in Quark 6 in English
  that&#39;s being translated into Hebrew. I found out that Hebrew is the exact opposite
  of English--it&#39;s read right to left and books are front to back. Is there an
  extension for Quark that can flow text in this manner? I&#39;ve seen a post regarding
  Arabic, which is apparently similar, but, from what I gather, it seems the extension
  doesn&#39;t work that well. Is anyone familiar with a Hebrew extension?

    in Hebrew.

    more expensive \"Passport\" version.) But InDesign ME offers better Hebrew support
    than Quark ever had. If all you need is a single booklet, there's a <a href=\"http://www.winsoft.fr/products/download/DownloadsME.html\">30
    day trial version available for download</a>.\r\n"
