    deserves its own set of fonts. There are of course the 'classics':\r\n\r\nStempel
    Garamond\r\nPMN Caecilia\r\nFF Meta\r\n\r\nAll personal favorites of course. I
    can make this list much much longer, but these three are on top!\r\n"

    ever find a good answer to that. Most of the people on Typophile (if you\u2019re
    not counting the general ID requesting crowd) are type designers, and we continue
    to draw new typefaces because we believe they can add something. The \u201Cbest\u201D
    font is certainly not a static thing, if it\u2019s even a thing in the first place."

    a bit of a tall order. \r\n\r\nThat said, Vignelli is (in)famous for his slim
    typeface toolbox: Bodoni, Helvetica, Times Roman, Century, Futura\r\n\r\n"

    cafeteria near a railway station or design a logo for a knitwear brand. I once
    started to make a photos of usage of brushscript in business environment. The
    trend ir transcontinental, I swear.\r\n\r\n2) Mistral.\r\nPreferred by sportswear
