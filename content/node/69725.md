    though \u2014 I think I'm better than just \"decent.\" Will that be an issue?"

  body: "Slightly off topic, but I noticed the phrase \"camera-ready art\" in the
    PDF describing the position. Is that expression even used anymore? The days of
    paste-up for the printer's camera are long gone.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a criticism
    of the job description; I'm just wondering if that expression is still in common
    usage.\r\n"

  body: I still see the phrase used every now and then. I assume it's probably just
    leftover from documents that haven't ever been updated for the 21st century. But
    I think most of the places I've seen it are in specifications for putting your
    logo on pens and shirts and stuff like that, so that would explain it.

    forgot to on the .PDF.  What do you guys typically say to describe the process

    depends how docile you'd like an intern to be.\r\n"

  body: "Garrettis,\r\n\r\nI'm sure how to politely state this, but what you are looking
    for is, somewhat, ridiculous. I'll agree to most of it, but I would LOVE to understand
    what \"Mastery of Adobe CS (PS, Illy, and InDesign)\" means. \r\n\r\nI agreee
    with jackson here....You want VERY good skills and you aren't willing to pay for
    them, as I see it. Plus, the kind of mastery of CS you are asking for....HOLY
    mackeral....that takes a lot longer than the 2 year degree person you are looking
    to hire for two years. Personally, I have been working with PS for 5 years, and
    I am not an expert. Let alone Illy, and InDesign.\r\n\r\nGood Luck on your search
    for the person who has \"mad skills\" and is desperate enough to take that pay.
    \ Heck, I'd apply for it myself, as soon as I graduate...But...then, I already
    have \"WICKED Skills\" anyways. :D"

  body: "I appreciate your comment darkwolf29a1. We've had to set the bar a little
    high hoping we get someone at least qualified, because a lot of people seem to
    consider themselves designers because their degree says so.  \r\n\r\nThis internship
    involves working on a variety of projects that may be considered a little more
    exciting than some environments, and at the end of two years should produce a
    decent real-world portfolio.  And finally, we're looking for the sort of person
    who cares about what we're doing.  This is a Christian ministry in the heart of
    Purdue University.  There's are people out there who, not only want to be designers,
    but want get behind a non-profit and what it stands for.  In other words, it isn't
    just about the salary or notoriety, but what they're producing at the end of the
    day.  We've had plenty of people apply, but it just hasn't seemed like the best
    fit.  I've already received a few more applicants since posting this, which is
    encouraging."
