body: "While I go merrily along kerning using class-based kerning in FontLab, I would
  like a way to turn the blue color off of the non-key glyphs in the Metrics window.
  It would be great if I could just hit the tilde key for a second while I judge the
  proximity of a kern pair but I would settle for something clumsier if that were
  all that were possible. I have tried clicking on the \"Preview\" mode but that does
  not seem to do anything at all. I get all characters in black only while in metrics
  mode but this does not help me judge a kerning pair. Is there some hidden magic
  I have overlooked or is this just another known bug that has not been fixed?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: The only other trick is to turn class kerning off using the Class Kerning
    pop-up at the top of the Metrics window. You will only be able to see kerning
    on key glyphs, though.

    to work with all colors set to black.
