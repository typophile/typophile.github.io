  the way the Nintendo Wii reflows text?! It's the freakiest thing I've seen in a
  long time. I searched Typophile for a while and found nothing. Maybe because there's
  nothing we can do about it... But it's still freaky enough to be interesting.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOn
  the Wii you can read live news stories. Super. You can zoom the text in and out.
  Super. When you change the zoom level the words fly to their new positions - each
  word separately! Super freaky. Should I put up a video of it on Flickr, or has everybody
  already seen it?\r\n\r\nAnd does this mean the Wii text renderer (who made it BTW?)
  makes a \"sprite\" out of each word and then moves them all around, resizing them
  along the way?! The thing is, why go to the trouble? I guess it just makes it more
  game-like. Wow.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    With enough text your headline is pretty much what you want. Robert Murdoch will
    love that: War in Irak is totally against any humanitarian gain > humanitarian
    War in Irak.'

  body: "Yelp! That is nuts. Looks like the designer was tripping or something.\r\n\r\nTomi,
    the headline stays the same, it just <em>looks</em> like more bits are added from
    the text. The motion paths are pretty funky \u2013 when the size is decreased,
    it looks like the bits that reflow to the first line come from wayyy below. Seems
    pretty confusing to me, but then I'm so not the target audience for this sort
    of thing."
