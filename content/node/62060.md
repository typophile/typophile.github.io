body: Hi. Just new to Typophile. I am transcribing some printed materials published
  in the American West (Illinois, Missouri, etc.) in the 1830s and 1840s. Our transcription
  style requires us to identify whether puncutation is roman or italic. It is of course
  quite easy to see the difference on most punctuation marks--except for the period.
  In something printed from my computer on a laser printer, I can see whether a period
  is italic or roman, but it is impossible to tell from old printed materials, when
  periods were not really uniform anyway (b/c, e.g., the type was old). So instead,
  I am trying to figure out if the printers would have even owned an italic period.
  Was there such a thing back then? And if so, would it have been common or rare for
  a printer to actually own and use such a piece of type? Can any of you recommend
  something in print that discusses matters like this?

  body: While I'm at it, I should ask another question too. Some of the em dashes
    in the printed materials I am transcribing appear to have been formed by two smaller
    dashes, likely en dashes. They were probably meant to look like a single dash,
    but there is a hairspace between them, perhaps because the ink didn't get applied
    properly. Did printers often make em dashes by combinining two en dashes, or would
    they have done this only when they ran out of em dashes?

    a b*tch, so my guess is that they would have been mixed anyway. Just go for the

    of detail-obsessed 20th-century Swiss typefounders. But it seems that 17th-century
    French theoretical type designers were even more obsessed by such curious and
    impractical things. This is the 38-point size of the <em>romain du roi</em>, from
