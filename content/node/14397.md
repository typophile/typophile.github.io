  body: 'I was asked this recently by another designer, so prepared a sample of images
    of original Greek typewriter output, from legal documents. Some are from the second
    sheet (i.e. softer impression and transfer ink) but in these cases I have shot
    sections with corrections to the text, so bits with original strikes are alongside.
    All manual mechanical, plus one Selectric. Archive here: http://www.leonidas.org/ftp/GLtw_samples.gz '
