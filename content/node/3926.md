    <BR>Take a look at the &#39;elf&#39; trademark. The &#39;f&#39; is pretty quirky,
    the &#39;e&#39; is too big. I wouldn&#39;t call this good typography. But I would
    regard the &#42;mark&#42; &#40;the image&#41; very good, unique and catchy. <BR>

    <BR> <BR> <BR>So what is the conclusion? Maybe that typographic excellence isn&#39;t
    everything when creating corporate identity.

    but I think the arrow is too hidden, my point being that the designer was maybe
    appealing more to himself/other_designers than &#34;users&#34;; making the arrow
    more obvious &#40;like by gently highlighting the negative space in some way&#41;
    would have drawn jeers from other designers &#40;the shame, the ridicule!&#41;,

    food compared to the burger chains. Their ingredients may be factory-farmed but
    the experience of walking into a Subway you never visited before is a bit more
    like a roll of the dice than the totally predictable experience at any given McDonalds
    etc. The care or lack thereof that the Subway &#34;sandwich artists&#34; give

    hope the logo debacle isn&#39;t some sort of indication that an unwelcome change
    is in the offing. <BR> <BR>And let&#39;s not forget that their interior decor
    features late 19th/early 20th century newspaper reproductions covering the walls.
    - full of nice examples of the use of Cheltenham, amongst other types. There must
