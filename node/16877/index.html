  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this but have never had the courage. Criticism, even constructive, can be hard to take. But I&rsquo;d rather learn and improve than sit in a cardboard box with a towel over my head, so&hellip; any comments you have about this layout would be greatly valued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for a garden, and will possibly be lasercut into an A3-sized block of wood. If not, it&rsquo;ll just be digitally printed onto a panel. The typeface, Interstate, is used throughout the site. I&rsquo;ve basically sought to reference the ripple effect of water, and to create rivers around the distinct phrases. I&rsquo;ve used loose tracking to&hellip; loosen things up, they way the body does when you&rsquo;re &lsquo;running&rsquo;, &lsquo;talking&rsquo; and &lsquo;walking&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Is that enough of my thinking to go on?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I get what you&rsquo;re trying to do with the different sizes and loose placement of the words/phrases, but the effect - for me - is not quite as peaceful or calming the words suggest. Maybe try a little more leading and perhaps not quite as many sizes of type - or a little more uniformity to the sizes. Then the phrases might flow a bit more, rather than seeming to start and stop.</p>
<p>Personally I tend to find it hard to read type where the tracking is greater than the leading.</p>

On your setting I would like to know what the animals are doing, but I will wait before seeing your amendments. If you print this direct to media a nice grainy wood will add to the flow.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I&rsquo;ve added a second image to my original post. Thanks for the tip. I&rsquo;m using Safari. I thought that had the Flash plug-in built-in? Oh well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make this version lighter, and to flow more gracefully. I certainly think it feels calmer than my first one. Although I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s now a bit too floaty?</p>
<p>Timd, I don&rsquo;t quite understand what you mean by &lsquo;what the animals are doing&rsquo;? Do you mean that the layout doesn&rsquo;t reflect the &lsquo;walking&rsquo; aspect?</p>

<p>One small point, in the line SMALL ROCKS AND BIG ROCKS I might make the AND the smaller size. It doesn&rsquo;t need that kind of emphasis and also if it&rsquo;s smaller the BIG will stand out more as larger.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The second layout is much better. The poem doesn&rsquo;t seem llike a torrent of water. I can almost here the babbling brook in the words of the poem. That is what you should try to emulate. I think the second gets closer to it than the first. Do you have a lighter weight of this same typeface? A little variety could be very nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good point with the &lsquo;AND&rsquo;. I always feel a little conflicted when I come across words like &lsquo;big&rsquo; and &lsquo;small&rsquo;. Making them BIG and small seems too obvious and literal, but it seemed right this time from a textural point-of-view.</p>
<p>I do have the lighter weights. I didn&rsquo;t use them initially because the piece needs to be legible from a distance, and I was concerned that a lighter weight might be too thin. Particulalry as there&rsquo;s the possibility it will be cut into wood, so the contrast might not be as high. I guess I need to get an answer on the wood question. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve used a lighter weight and, yeah, it does give the texture a little more variety.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>What I meant was I wanted to know what the animals were doing while the birds are talking <strong>in the trees</strong>, it might be your intention to leave the reader to consider that (I don&rsquo;t know the original poem). Your latest revision has the qualities you were looking for I question why animals are treated in a smaller point size than birds although I think you are right to avoid that box created by the ellipsis and quote in your first post.
