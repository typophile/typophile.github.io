  body: "Can't find a match. This /a reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din|DIN]].
    The only \"true\" DIN Mono I know is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-mono|Parachute
    version]]. For the rest, it is very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neustadt|Neustadt]]
    (mainly /S and /s). \r\nBinnenland [[http://www.binnenland.ch/font/show/Regular|Regular]]
    and [[http://www.binnenland.ch/font/show/T-Star|Mono Round]]/[[http://www.binnenland.ch/font/show/T-Star-TW|TW]]/[[http://fonts.gestalten.com/t-star-mono-round.html|Mono
    Round]] might work pretty well as substitute. [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Simple|Simple
    LL]] is another option to consider."
