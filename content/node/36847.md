  body: Huh? Mason is still available, it's just the name that changed. This is the
    freeware bad rip-off, so I suggest you use the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=mason">original</a>.

  body: "I know it by Manson (serif only). When adding a sans version they must have
    skipped the n. That\u2019s what I call political correctness in the type business.
    Or Barnbrook planned to design a compagnion by the name of Dixon. Still, MANSON
    is not available any more."

  body: Nope, that's what you should call Emigre chickening out and going over the
    type designer's head. This was a quite unsavory glitch in the history of Emigre.
    Jonathan wasn't very happy about the name change.
