body: I&#39;m working on a logotype for a new company that sells framed, wallmounted,
  aquariums. Here&#39;s one of the many concepts. But I&#39;m struggling to find the
  perfect typeface. Obviously, Bank Gothic is not the best choice--but it&#39;s in
  the right direction.  <BR> <BR>Please help with any type suggestions. Thanks! <BR>

  body: 'Rick, tell us more about the business. Are these aquariums: mass consumer
    products?, custom made?, upscale? Will the logo be used as a sales tool &#40;ads,
    website&#41; or as a product idenification &#40;printed or  stamped on the product.
    Will these be sold in Kmart or only directly through dealers or direct from the
    company.'

    &#62; Possibly shown in model homes as an upgrade. They may also be sold in &#62;
    specialty pet shops.'

    don&#39;t seem quite different enough. <BR> <BR>is the reflection needed?'

    a frame?
