body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am creating a logo for an italian chef. The logo will be used
  in his CV and eventually in other brand identity projects.\r\n\r\nThe logo was developed
  on the basic foundation of a Bickham script, but adjusted and customized to meet
  the objectives of the client. It had been scaled down to a lighter overall solution,
  and particular focus had been given to make the edges and letter terminals more
  sharp than the original version in order to make it more modern looking. What do
  you think of it and how do you think it could be improved ?\r\n\r\nhttp://postimage.org/image/dq7rpo2ox/\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your attention"

  body: "It is ok, as he will be presenting CV's in person when applying for the job
    and will tell them straight away the position he intends to occupy. However, I
    developed an alternative version with a descriptive type which will come handy
    when the logo will, eventually, used on the web .\r\n\r\nHere is it :\r\n\r\nhttp://postimage.org/image/5wvqwzlof/\r\n\r\nLet
    me know your thoughts about it"

  body: "Can't evaluate it as a logo without knowing more about the chef, his personality
    and style, and what qualities  you're trying to communicate with it.\r\n\r\nBut
    one general thought is that it looks like a signature, but yet is clearly just
    typeset since it's so perfect and the letters that repeat (a, t) are identical
    each time. Perhaps more of a signature look would make it more personal and unique.\r\n"

  body: "Why make a logo where you have to be there in person to attenuate its shortcomings?\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice (not to mention pretty much de rigueur) to have a logo that will
    work way beyond a job interview (where frankly a logo isn't that relevant, unless
    it's for a graphic designer).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all for your replies.\r\n\r\nYou have brought up in discussion
    some intresting arguments .\r\n\r\n@ James: The client is an italian commis chef
    wants to communicate a stylish feeling to his image, as his cooking target is
    of high-class. He prepares stylish dishes and as a consequence w both agreed on
    a signature style logo, but didn't want to create a real signature. We wanted
    to convey only the essence of a signature style logo, that's the reason why some
    of the elements that you pointed out are the way they are. He said that the end
    work really reflects what he wanted to convey. \r\n\r\n@hrant: I think I haven't
    expressed myself well enough. You are right, I wouldn't make a logo only for a
    CV, but at the moment the client don't want to invest in the creation of other
    branding/advertising services (website,business cards etc ... ), but the logo
    IS intended to work perfectly across ANY other communication project , both on
    print and on the web, and this is something I take in consideration with EVERY
    logo I design. This is the first step to build a more vast brand in a future occasion
    .\r\n\r\n@Ratbaggy: Thank for your opinion, but exactly what do you mean by that
    ? What are the elements that in your opinion are generic and how would you improve
    it ? \r\n\r\nAgain, every feed is welcomed !\r\n\r\n\r\n"
