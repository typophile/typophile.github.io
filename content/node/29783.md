  I am currently doing a PhD in the area of screen typography at the London College
  of Communications (formerly LCP) under the supervision of Teal Triggs. \r\n\r\nI
  have been slowly building a research web blog and site www.type4screen.com which
  is a way for me to capture ideas as they occur, track topical developments, research
  and information in the field, and create a body of references/links in one place.
  I hope in time it will become a useful resource to others interested in the area.
  I will also use it to publish my own practical experiments etc as they develop.
  I would be grateful for any input, feedback, suggestions, comments etc.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance.\r\n"
