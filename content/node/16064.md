  body: At the very least, I would make the flourishes less bold than the strokes
    that define the characters. How much less is a judgement call--enough that the
    word stands out sufficiently.

    noticed that it is stronger (simple) shape in the counter-forms that give a better
    result to the florish. This is a good little exercise, I am learning a lot."

  body: "In most calligraphy, if the pen is not changing direction, there will not
    be a weight difference, because you keep the pen at the same angle throughout.
    For example, the longest portion of the L changes from very thin to fairly thick,
    but since you are barely changing direction this wouldn't happen. \r\n\r\nAlso
    the thick/thin parts of the strokes are not occuring in the correct part of the
    loops. Similar loop formations will look the same - the bottom left loop in the
    L and the lowest loop in the logo should be nearly identical in that regard.\r\n\r\nIt
    might help to trace your logo with a calligraphy pen to see where the thickest
    parts should be and how the inner and outer shapes relate.\r\n\r\nThe logo as
    a whole looks very fun. Will this be going on a menu or is it just for practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: That looks much better. The modulation of the thick and thin in the flourishes
    was off in the earlier versions. You seem to have got the right rhythm going in
    the newest one, and the curves look more natural.

  body: A broad nib calligraphy pen is not the only way to draw letters, either. There
    is considerably more flexibility with a brush or quill pen, for example. This
    style appears most like a brush script to me. Ultimately, it's a question of balance,
    rhythm and flow.

  body: "Pen direction would be \"from point a to point b\"; pen angle would be what
    angle you are holding the pen. In general, or I guess in basic calligraphy anyways,
    you would keep these fairly consistent. From a speedball book on italic:\r\n\r\n\"The
    pen...is usually held between 30\xBA and 40\xBA for the miniscules and 25\xBA
    for the capitals. The letters slant 5\xBA to 7\xBA to the baseline. Steepen the
    pen angle on the bold diagonal strokes to achieve a more even weight.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    letters are definitely brush-based so perhaps experimenting with a brush is a
    better suggestion.\r\n\r\nSebsan..just leave it to us to take the fun out of calligraphy.

  body: "Frankly, I fear this is becoming committee-designed! \r\n\r\nFlip back from
    the latest sample to the first. The first one has a lot of juice, playfulness,
    and the weight distribution on the swashes really is fine (This coming from an
    inveterate calligrapher). In the later versions all the fun is being canceled
    out and logical-ized. For a logo, it can be very lively and messy; see some of
    Ed Benguiat's early copperplate confections. The only thing I would change about
    the original is to find a way to balance the density of the decorative strokes
    around Lunch in the middle. There could be more ornament to the left of L, less
    density above and more below. Otherwise I think it is very distinctive. Underware
    does things like this with hand lettering, and it can be very pleasing, without
    being undecipherable. "
