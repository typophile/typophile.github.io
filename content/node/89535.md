  with the sharp serifs of a post modernist typeface. I like the way it feels when
  it's large, but I'm thinking there is going to be some serious legibility issues
  at smaller sizes. Does anyone have any advice on how to check for legibility during
  their process? \r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1F1F1L0h02220i1q1p3z"

    more to it than that! :-)  If/when you target\r\nsmall sizes you will however
    need to worry about proper\r\n\"stroke\" contrast, vertical proportions, width,
    spacing, etc.\r\nIn fact, just like thin strokes have to be thickened, those gaps,\r\nbeing
    also small features, need to be enlarged. On the other\r\nhand I might consider
    dumping those anyway.\r\n\r\n* You might want to look at the work of John Downer.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    although I'm not a fan or \"constructed\" type, if\r\ndone sensitively this can
    turn out to be quite nice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    check printouts at intended size, taking into account the difference between your
    printer and offset, if that is your target. If on screen, then screen at intended
    size. Also you need enough characters to do words, so that it can be read, not
    just looked at.  '
