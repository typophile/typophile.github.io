body: I had chosen Sovereign as the typeface for a logo I'm designing for a modern,
  slightly indian themed gift shop. The problem is when using small caps, the typeface
  looses it's unique calligraphic style. Does anyone have a recommendation for a similar
  (or not) typeface that maintains a unique quality in small caps, although I guess
  small caps are not mandatory if someone has another great suggestion. Also, I plan
  on using the type on a slight arc. Thanks so much.

  body: The Indian theme could be sans serif  as a contrast but if you must try Brioso
    for the classic serif small caps.
