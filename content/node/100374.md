  design and animation outfit called.\r\n\r\nWhile we've got some type directions
  in place that we're happy with, I thought I'd open it out to you knowledgeable folk
  to offer suggestions of typefaces that might hit the mark.\r\n\r\nAs a business
  we sit somewhere between a creative animation studio (Frankfurter) and a sharp,
  design-led VFX company (modified Baskerville Old Face). While the worlds are seemingly
  polar opposites, we feel there might be some middle ground worth exploring.\r\n\r\nSo
  ... with that little tidbit of info, got any suggestions of faces?\r\nFire away
  with any questions too.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

    have also looked at Italia, though a comment was made that it seemed a bit \"all
    over the shop\"."

    essences of Italia in Ernestine too.\r\n\r\nWe did a quick throw together with
    Ernestine in PS and it really looks like it could work! The uberlicious italics
    are what we're leaning to.\r\n\r\n"
