body: "Since its inception in 1963, the Library at Massey College has developed special
  collections in the History of the Book as well as supporting a working nineteenth-century
  hand printing shop. The holdings of books and manuscripts include material on the
  history of printing, papermaking, bookbinding, palaeography, calligraphy, type design,
  book collecting, and bibliography. The examples of book production range from the
  fifteenth century to the present, with a particular strength in nineteenth century
  colour printing and publishers' bookbindings represented in the Ruari McLean Collection.
  The collections also include the papers of Canadian graphic designer [[Carl Dair]].\r\n\r\nURL:
