  body: That&#39;s pretty cool Christos. I wonder how many viewers will see all three
    letters in your mark? Since you have your title written out, it might not matter

  body: Xpistos, <BR>I think it looks good! You might slightly move the white &#34;T&#34;
    counter to the left a very small quantity and move your name a tiny amount to
    the right to make the tail of the &#34;T&#34; a bit longer. <BR>I definitely prefer
    the second version.  The T, C, and D might need to be a bit bolder or perhaps
    have a dot or even an underscore below each of those 3 letters. <BR> <BR>Yasou,

  body: Christos, <BR> <BR>I like the mark.  I think it works.  Don&#39;t  know your
    work, but I get a very rigid and simple vide from it.  Like your work is clean
    and sans needless embellishements. <BR> <BR>What is not working for me is the
    type treatment.  I can&#39;t read that big line of letters no matter what is bold
    and regular.   <BR> <BR>I would go with a less bitmappy treatment and us a nice
    humanist or geometric sans.  Have christos tsolerides be bigger than design perhaps.   <BR>
    <BR>And I don&#39;t think the size relation between the mark and type is working.  I
    would not try and line up the type with the &#39;entrance&#39; to the mark, get
    them more balances out in size.  I could even see the mark going to the right
    of the type, almost like a book-end or period. <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts <IMG

    customers English speaking? Do you also have one in Greek? <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Since your last name &#40;Tsolerides&#41; is rather unusual at least in US/
    Western Europe/Latin America, I would make sure it is very easy to read, adding
    spacing between it and your first name improves the legibility. - example a &#34;T&#34;
    is not usually followed by an &#34;s&#34; in western Europe/US&#41;. If this is
    to be used in the country of its &#40;the name&#41; origin perhaps it is less
    of an issue.

    that I&#39;ve seen on Typophile, you deserve a much more human logo. <BR> <BR>You
    moved to western europe recently, right? <BR>Wherever you go, stay yourself, my
    friend. <BR> <BR>hhp

    these forums&#41; than the logo suggests. I reckon you can make it sing. <BR>

  body: Hey, this is not just a critic. This is more than i expected and i really
    thank you all for your interest. I am too busy right now so i am not ready to
    send you my reply, but i couldn&#39;t stand not replying to the last 2 posts from
    Hrant and Chris. You are both right and actually exactely this question were on
    my mind yesterday when Peter said that he doesn&#39;t know my work. Thank you
    all again and i have to say i am honnoured to have such an interest from almost
    all the typophiles whose work i admire. <BR> <BR>I wish that soon i will be ready
    to give you some feedback. <BR> <BR>christos

    As in the first letter of your first name, sort of. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hrant there is no reason to feel guilty. On the contrary your reaction shows
    that you care and i deeply appreciate it. <BR> <BR>I like the idea of &#34;X&#34;
    but i am thinking if this is negative, since X meaning prohibition. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>christos <BR> <BR>P.S. Just a question -out of subject- that i am going to
    ask to &#34;General Discussions&#34; board too. I am searching for an MA course
    in Typography or in graphic design. The problem is that i cannot quit ny job in
    Thessaloniki so i have to attent it from distance &#40;internet or post&#41;.
    Of course it has to be in english. So, if you know anything please do let me know.

    out&#41;: <BR>X also marks the spot. Also the X-Men are pretty cool. XML is handy.
    Stay away from Xtremes and XGames. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as prohibitive
    as you might imagine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d encourage you to spend some time exploring

  body: I think the worst [general] thing that can be said about the &#34;X&#34; is
    that it has an &#34;anti&#34; air about it - but even that can be useful. And
    a good thing that can be said about it is that it&#39;s charged with complex meaning
    - it has great presence. <BR> <BR>If it were that clearly controversial it would
    have never passed the focus groups at Apple. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Just looking at this now, but I think Hrant got it right: Your work is so
    richly and warmly artistic that your logo should reflect that. This logo is not
    only frigid, but awkward - just the opposite of your fabulous poster work. Scrap
    it and start over is my amateur opinion.  <BR> <BR>By the way, it is possible
    for someone with great artistic &#39;chops&#39; like you to do spare and clean
    stuff with flair - not that you have to for this logo. See the Ecco logo at louisefilli.com'
