  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hello everybody,

I have a friend who is psychiatrist/pedo-psychiatrist and who ask me for a logo. He ask me two thing; he'd like to have the "Psy" Ѱ greek letter inside the logo and/or to have a notion of evolution/getting better. Right now i didn't have found the solution - if any - with the two requirements. The initials of his familyname and forename are "mm"
So I have two projects, i tried to be very sober and minimalistic, the logo usage for his needs will be almost always in black:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psy2_5499.jpg]
So, any thoughs on this that might help?
thanks.

As for the Ms, I would try something in which the two elements of the single letter are of different heights (like your second example), so to create a relationship with the "branches" of the Ψ.

:-D indeed!

But if you try to invert the implied shape in order to make it resemble more a tree trunk (larger at the base, narrower at the top) it could work.

The ones I like better are the last two, even though the second to last still needs some work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i think that Capitals - and that's the reason i didn't post it before - are too much up and down, wich might be an good example of somes psychic illness, but for a psychiatrist i think it's too unstable, not comforting. Personally the project i like most is the second of 25th july post (because of the regularity and the simmetry and it's the most stable) and the 4th one of the last post (with the progressive mm). i am reworking the proportion of the 'mm' to make it smaller.

I have a color version if needed (that's RGB for now but could be easily converted to a 2 colors for print)

Not to ramble your process and not related to your design, but the letter PSI stands more for parapsychology. Also see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi]].

Maybe not the kind of thing your client actually wants...?

To be honest, I think the psi will be pretty much lost on anyone outside of other professionals, especially if it's distorted.

Maybe focus on the "growth" part for a bit, and not the psi or m per se?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">okay, m&m's and ante-psy, well i'm going the right way it seems :D

When he show me what was his first logo (just a psy symbol in a circle) the 'm' in it was the first thing i saw, and my first drafts.
But i was kinda, unsatisfied with inverting the symbol, maybe inverted it has another meaning (ie inverted christian cross mean ante-christ), so since he's in hollydays and i won't ask him until he comes back, i tried other ways.

@marco: nope, i don't think he want that, i'll talk with him about that. I know - with the help of comptetent people - he use hypnosis  for heavy traumatised people case, i don't know if it's considered as parapsy ?

i tried with a sort of flower/propeller thingy, does it insprire growth or hope (or at least a positive image????) to you ? (it's not the real name, but take same space)

		<div class="commentbody">Since it's for a person and not a brand I think the name should be spelled out and capitalized just like you did in the last example. Even including "Psychiatrist.Pedosychiatrist" is a very good choice. As far as the symbol goes, the Psi glyph sounds like a great idea and the client wants it. Only problem with Psi is that in a Greek speaking community it will be looked at as a letter not as a symbol that might be confusing cause the guy's initials are Ms. So if you're not in Greece it shouldn't be a problem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Much thanks for your comments. Of course the final version of the logo will have full name and specialisations, like the flower logo,
but right now i'm focusing on the symbol.
on the previous version i've tried a dark grey for the sans symbol, i've tried a grey lighter here because it was not visible.

Do you think i should make a sans lighter in weight (for thoses who like the sans better)? Personnaly i like the sans better because it looks the most stable, the most solid, and people who are in distress are in need for that, something that they can grab on.
But on the other side it's also a very subltle work so maybe a serif like - i serioulsy need to improve my technical english on design because i have no idea how to express the subtilities of a serif font.:-/

		<div class="commentbody">Top right and top middle is interesting.  However, the top right does cause me to think about the Bank of America logo... :T  Just me?  But playing with the figure-ground-reversal is the best way to go.  Can you impliment the leaves, but just less of them?  Perhaps show growth in only three stages?

		<div class="commentbody">hi everybody, thanks for your comments.

@samwiek: your right Sam, i had it corrected to show my friend (or the client) but forget to update it here.

@thepiaypus: one thing i can see in this logo is some sort of eagle, looking to the right. For the reference of Bank of America, i google it but can't find nothing that look like this logo :?  The more i look a the leaves logo thing, the more i find it too heavy and not subtle enough.

The client loved a lot the flower/propeller logo too and the double mm where he see an aqueduct. i tell him my point of vue (simplicity is best) and my preference (the top right logo), now he's looking with colleague of him to have opinions. but i had to calm him down because first he wanted the double m mixed with the flower/properler logo :D      
i'have already worked on some typo, but since i don't know his choice, it may be too early to post them, i don't want to use your time for nothing.</div>
