body: "Hello! Can anyone help me with recognizing this typeface?\r\nIt's a geometric
  sans serif, looks lot like a mixture of Erbar, Kabel, Nobel and Futura.  I included
  the scan of the page as an attachment. \r\nThe book where I found it is printed
  in 1931 by Lumax printing press in Utrecht, Netherlands. \r\nThe most noticeable
  feature which makes a difference to other similar geometric sans serifs is the lowercase
  w which has a strange crossing. Lowercase a looks a lot like Erbar but it's a bit
  more condensed. Other letters are really round and geometric.\r\n\r\nI have a guess
  that the typeface might be german but i'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAny knowledge about the
  foundry or other sources to look at would be much appreciated."

  body: It's quite similar to period cuts of Erbar Grotesk, but the w isn't right...

  body: "Hmm... Neuzeit Grotesk is maybe so far the closest guess. There are still
    more details that don't quite match, like the curved lowercase l in the linotype
    version. On the other hand, if you look at other interpretations on the same subject,
    like Bitstream's Geometric 706, you can find a straight l. Maybe there was originally
    a bunch of alternative characters.\r\n\r\nHas someone seen the original specimen
    of Neuzeit Grotesk? Or the drawings of Wilhelm Pischner?"

    popular styles to keep a hold on their home market \u2014 your sample suggest
    Dutch ones. \r\n\r\nYour best shot for a proper identification is to look at specimens
    of Amsterdamsche Lettergieterij (my first bet) or Ensched\xE9.\r\n\r\n"

    even though the picture is quite small.  \r\n\r\nIf I look at the other characters
    all the details seem to match. Look at uppercase J which really stands out. Also
    the figures seem similar. My print is just a bit darker.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/052_2_4150.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numbers2_6589.jpg]\r\nIf
    you have some ideas where I could find specimens of Neuzeit Grotesk, especially
    that version, would be awesome. Was there more material in the Spatium DVD, Mark?"

  body: "That was all I found on the DVD. It's a compilation of someone's collection,
    from what I gather (I don't understand much German), and some of it's a bit sketchy.
    The card in that scan says it's from Stempel, 1930. There are other specimens
    of Neuzeit Grotesk, but not with that \"w\". Here's a larger image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bigger_3688.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
    guess would be that the \"w\" was changed early on to the form that you see in
    current versions."
