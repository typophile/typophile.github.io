body: "Hi there -\r\n\r\nI am going to make a booklet to be inserted in a cd cover.
  Quite a lot of text is needed, so I will have to use a size around 7 ... 7,5 ...
  8 ... 8,5 pt.\r\n\r\nI have not yet considered any fonts. It could be a sans or
  a serifed - it only has to be highly legible in very small sizes.\r\n\r\nThe booklet
  is to be laserprinted in 144dpi (as is the whole cd cover, which I make as a gift
  for a friend).\r\n\r\nCould be interesting to hear your views. Sorry if this has
  been beaten to the bone regularly \u2013 I have been away from Typophile for a couple
  of years.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nsoren_olsen"

    like something stylish, try FF Avance.\r\nAnother one of my small-size favorites

  body: "Oh, Photoshop, now I get it. Yes, it's line-screen, so lpi.\r\nBut the type
    is (probably) going to end up very very lo-res...\r\nCan't you use a layout program,
    with whatever image in the\r\nbackground, and the type as \"object\" in the foreground?\r\nOr
    maybe you keep the type as object in Photoshop, and\r\nit works out?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hrant, maybe I misguided you, explained about the resolution ... I will
      try again: I am going to design this cd cover in Adobe Illustrator. The booklet
      that will be inserted in the cover will be around 8 pages of nothing but text,
      probably two columns. This booklet I will do in InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe reason
      I brought on the subject of resolution is that the project will not be produced
      in offset - but will be made using a color printer, KonicaMinolta Bizhub (possibly
      bizhub 350 or similar). I now realize that 144 lpi may be the wrong thing to
      say (at the moment I wrote the post I remembered that figure, because I have
      used it for photos at one point) the res may be quite higher when dealing with
      vector graphics and type ... frankly, I don't know very much about it :-/\r\n\r\nBTW
      ... what's your opinion on Charter as regards to legibility in small sizes (given
      that you don't hate the sight of that typeface)?\r\n\r\n--\r\nsoren_olsen"
