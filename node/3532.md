body: I was looking through an old RS from 2001 and came across these gorgeous fonts.
  I did a search on all the old &#34;Rolling Stone&#34; fonts so I don&#39;t think
  this was covered before. If it was forgive me. Here&#39;s a sample. The type in
  question is the calligraphically inspired typeface that&#39;s used in an italic
  &#40;?&#41; and in all caps. I&#39;ve also included a sample of their text face.
  This looks like FB&#39;s Parkinson but I wanted to be sure. I sincerely hope this
  is not custom. They&#39;re gorgeous. Thanks for the help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28295.jpg"

    Mark ID&#39;d this not too long ago in another thread, and included links, I believe.

  body: Thanks a great deal guys. I saw Mark ID Rialto a while back but didn&#39;t
    connect the two. &#40;Shakes head&#41;. One thing&#39;s for sure, it&#39;s gorgeous.
    Now to try to find out how to buy it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Eric&#39;s right on the text. RS has always been fond of venetians,  <BR>even
    under different ADs. Woodward used a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-schneidler/medium/testdrive.html?s=Talking%20Heads%20are%20the%20greatest%20band%20ever.&amp;p=24&amp;refby=typographica"

    which is in Austria. <BR> <BR>It turns out this is the same link Mark gave, although
    I didn&#39;t realize that until I hunted up the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26918.html"

    think they have a web site. I couldn&#39;t find one either.

  body: Has anyone purchased this? I&#39;ve emailed them and heard nothing back. I&#39;ve
    heard rumors, though, it costs as much as 580 Euros. This is a beautiful typeface
    but isn&#39;t that a bit much for 4 fonts?

    is referring to in the Rolling Stones article?"
