  was kind of easy compared to that). I actually made it a few years ago. I've tried
  to balance the regularity and simplicity of the font with something --- well, I
  don't think it could be called humanism --- perhaps life, spirit or just warmth.\r\n\r\nHave
  I succeeded? Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scarange.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scarange_4948.png]"

  body: I think the R is quite nice, but I think it might a bit more quirks and variations
    on the module to make it more 'human'.

  body: I like the curve at the end of the "r". Pehapsyou could work something like
    that into the apetures of the "a" "s" and "c" too. Overall I like it though, and
    it seems that it would have a host of applications.

  body: "I realise now I overstated my case a bit. \"humanism \u2014 perhaps life,
    spirit or just warmth\" -- yeah, right.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been a bit busy the
    past few weeks, so I've only started looking into your suggestions. I've quickly
    drawn up an alternative _a_, inspired by your suggestions, and I'd like to know
    what you think.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Once more with attachments:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scarange_4948.png]\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your words so far, and I'm looking forward to more."

  body: "The 'a' is great.  What about making the curve of the h, p (and similar letters)
    meet the vertical stroke at a bit of an angle?  Also, what about terminating the
    ends of the stroke in the a, r (and similar) at a slight angle instead of right
    angles?\r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: Wow, I really like the new 'a' a lot. If you could work some of the personality
    of that 'a' into some of the other characters, I'd say you're definitely onto
    something. I'd also like to see a lc e with some of those same features. Maybe
    start with the 'a', rotate it 180 degrees and acquire some inspiration from that...?

    ideas for variation.\r\n\r\nI'll probably post something new in a few hours.\r\n\r\nGood
    to know people are still looking at this. Thanks."

  body: It may be that I'm a bit biased to my suggestion, but I think that helped
    to spread some of that angle goodness around.

  body: Thank you all. Any more suggestions, or is it polish time? I need to place
    my diacritics more carefully (maybe redraw the circumflex?), check the spacing,
    add some kerns, etc.

  body: "I like it as is, but a few things I would experiment with if I was working
    on it would be:\r\n\r\n- trying to make the descenders on the lc letters more
    interesting. maybe more of that 'a' angle?\r\n\r\n- the lc t feels a little boring
    to me\r\n\r\n- the serifs on the uc I bother me a little bit. Perhaps they're
    too large? Maybe my mind would change to see more text typeset in the font."

  body: I've got a new 't', and fixed up some spacing. I've generated TT hints, but
    I'm not sure if PDFs use them.
