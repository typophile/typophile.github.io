  these as part of a logo. I'm now refining it and know there <strong> has </strong>
  to be typefaces similar to this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/am_5812.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  know two similar characters isn't much to go by, so I'm up for as many recommendations
  you can give me that are in the same vein as what you see here. It doesn't necessarily
  have to be italicized or have the sharp serifs. If it does...then great!\r\n\r\nThanks
  a bunch!"
