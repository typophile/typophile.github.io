  Making research about the unfortunate and talented Oz Cooper, I've learned that
  his teacher and mentor in type design was Frederic Goudy, and a few years after
  they parted their ways, when Cooper Black became a huge success, most of the competiting
  foundries made copies of this type, and of these replicas was made by... Frederic
  Goudy himself. Oz Cooper was quite bitter, tried unsuccessfully to protect his design,
  and finally died from cancer in 1940 at age 61.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know more about
  this? I'd like to learn.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "David R, You said you read this story but didn't say where. Could you provide
    a source (online or printed)? I've been curious about the story since hearing
    it in the Cheshire Dave film which I agree is very funny and very clever.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the narrator's claim in the Cheshire Dave film never seemed right for the simple
    fact that the specific Goudy type (was it Pabst?) mentioned doesn't look at all
    like Cooper Black to my eye. It might be another. The lettering style is imitated
    all the time during the period. And guys, let's remember, plagiarism was rampant
    at the time (look at ATF and Koch, or Continental Type Foundry's [FWG's foundry
    type distributor in the 1930s] attempt to sue ATF in the 1920s) and designers
    (including Goudy) didn't get rich off their commercial designs. They made their
    money on private designs and book/advertising design.\r\n\r\nI doubt the story
    made it into print in their day. Most of the nasty comments about Goudy found
    their way into private letters or unpublished talk. Rudolf Ruzicka's <cite>Speaking
    Reminiscently</cite> (Grolier Club, 1986)([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/13803244|cite]])
    mentions his own break with FWG over a portrait--it was Goudy's egotism that irritated
    RR. (The unedited tapes are held by the Club but FWG warrants only two short mentions.)
    Morison and Updike wrote snidely about G in their private correspondence (but
    then they also were a bit snide about Bruce Rogers too). If you don't have <cite>The
    Book of Oz Cooper</cite> (STA, 1949) ([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/41547813|cite]]),
    you should look at it. I think RH Middleton also has a Cooper book ([[http://worldcat.org/oclc/34637591|cite]]).
    Not much published on him outside the Chicago area. You might check with current
    Chicago-area AIGA members and such. A number of old-timers knew Middletown and
    had heard stories from them, but not being in Chicago, I've never tried to get
    the stories.\r\n\r\n-Paul"

    to compete with Cooper Black. As far as forgery, theft or inspired mimicry, you

  body: "I agree that they are significantly different. \r\n\r\nTo me Goudy Heavyface
    is not as good a typeface, even though it very well executed--maybe better than
    Cooper Black. The problem is that it is neither here nor there. It has the fat
    and soft look, but without the distinctive charm of Cooper Black. What is great
    about Cooper black is those endearing bulbous serifs and terminals--while still
    the face still has a strong spine, unlike Hobo or Souvenir. So yes, Goudy Heavyface
    could be used in more categories, but who wants to? You probably have better alternatives.
    But if you want something bold but cute, which is in demand in advertising, then
    there you have Cooper Black smiling at you. It has won the popularity contest
    with Goudy Heavyface and I think you can see why. \r\n\r\nChris, I disagree with
    you that Goudy is 'more crisp', as it is still quite soft. For a charming fat
    face that is more clean and crisp, we are awaiting the heavy weight of your \"Froggy,\"
    which you have shown in the Critique threads. Now that will give Cooper Black
    some real competition! "

  body: On the other hand -- speaking as a dilettante type observer -- Goudy's perpetuates
    the distinctive visual voice of its designer, so although it was evidently occasioned
    by Cooper Black, and clearly draws on Cooper's notion of a rounded, fat display
    face, the term "thief" seems wildly inappropriate. All the more so, in the pre-digital
    era.
