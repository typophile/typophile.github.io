  our typesetting colleagues on another continent. Some of this was done in InDesign,
  and some in 3B2 (version 9). I often have trouble with them failing to set characters
  beyond the basic Latin alphabet (eg, accented characters such as \xC5, and even
  bog-standard non-alphanumerics such as the \xA9 symbol), and have queried this with
  them. For example, I've seen a regular A kerned onto a degree symbol (yes, not even
  a floating ring-diacritic, but a \xB0), or a lowercase c kerned onto a circle taken
  out of some symbol font.\r\n\r\nThe response I have received is kinda hard to interpret,
  partly because it's techie but also because I suspect it's non-native-speaker English.\r\n\r\nSo
  if there's anyone on here who's <em>really</em> conversant with 3B2, please let
  me know, and then I can show you more detail and see if you think their response
  is reasonable...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,"

    -- much like (LA)TeX. PostScript fonts had to go through a conversion phase into
    the proprietary format, before the program could use them.\r\n\r\nAs with TeX
    fonts, it's not unusual to see \"original\" solutions to accented characters,
    unhindered by any standard such as Unicode.\r\n\r\nBut,\r\n\r\n<cite>... typesetting

    are unhindered by any typographical knowledge at all. Perhaps they have an extremely
    expensive and capable piece of software but don't have the accompanying manual."

    Unicode and OpenType fonts etc, but our setters say they currently have no plans
    to upgrade; partly, presumably, because of cost in the current climate, but also
    explicitly because it would involve redoing a load of their templates. Hmmm.\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

    not knowing anything else than plain ASCII. I find it quite hard to imagine even
    <em>basic</em> font conversions to 3B2's internal format looses A-ring and copyright.
    It makes more sense those guys don't even know they are special characters:\r\n\r\n\"Hey,
    dude, look what the client asks. How am I gonna type <em>that</em>?\" \"No prob,
    take an o, make it smaller, and manouevre it somewhat up ... there you go...\"\r\n\r\n<cite>partly
    because it\u2019s techie ...</cite>\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of 3B2 is a decade old
    and taken from the few pointers the sales rep was allowed to divulge, but even
    then I was amazed by both its price (...) <em>and</em> by its tantalizing abilities--in
    the range of and perhaps beyond what FrameMaker does in the hands of a pro.\r\n\r\nI'd
    love to see their explanation. Care to share some of the good bits?"

    Preflight reports nothing unusual -- some images in RGB. Some lines as well, although
    they appear on screen in black. And, come to think of it, all text is in RGB as
    well, leading to tons of warnings and absurd CMYK values. Ptoei!\r\n\r\nThe fonts
    have interesting names: AdvGreekM, AdvMT_SY, AdvPi1, etc., none of them has a
    recognizable regular font name. The plain text font, however, clearly is MS Trebuchet.\r\n\r\nI
    see a single '\xA9', but copying yields an ampersand. So no Unicode, but it <em>is</em>
    a real glyph, not a manually faked one. Copying an '=' gives a '\xBC'. A degree
    gives '8'. Well, perhaps those are symbol fonts.\r\n\r\nNo trademark sign--superscript
    'TM' instead. No plusminus but underlined '+'.\r\nBeta's have been slanted manually
    to fake italics, and they're not from Trebuchet.\r\n\r\nAll in all, yeah, some
    surprises. But at this level it's hard to differentiate between (possibly) program
    limitations and (probably) operator stoopidities."

    Arbortext's font conversion uses an entirely different encoding (one wonders why,

    It's not very user friendly not being able to access all characters, somehow.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Yeah, I've had another communication from them saying the \xA9 funnies were
    due to the symbol not being in the base font (!!) - in response to which I have
    asked if they can send me a copy of the font files so I can see for myself, as
    I can't believe this would be the case. (If they're sticklers for their licence
    conditions they may be chary about doing this, but we'll see.) These fonts are
    bog-standard stuff like Times and Bembo and Stone. My copy of Stone Sans that
    I got from Linotype certainly has it -- I'd have been very dissatisfied if it
    didn't!"

    the source fonts (thank goodness, and they have sent me their Win postscript copy
    of Stone Sans for verification), but say that the problem is down to them using
    <em>\"non Unicode version of 3B2 and there we are not able to produce \xA9 in
    that version\"</em>. They admit that <em>\"The switch of 3b2 version to Unicode
    would resolve this problem in totality. There would be addition work from our
    side, that would be to re-map all special characters and then validate the output.
    Apart from this there wouldn\u2019t be any change.\"</em>\r\n\r\nSo my only confusion
    still lies in why the \xA9 would necessitate Unicode version in the first place;
    at a position well within standard encodings it's not like I'm asking them to
    set an interrobang or a rune or something...? And with \xC5, is the ring diacritic
    further outside the \"norm\" than the degree sign? (Uh, now I think about that
    one, perhaps it is...)\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

    fonts in its own fnt format to enable all it clever stuff with character setting.
    Version 8 brough truetype font support and 9+ added open type support.\r\n\r\nPre
    unicode the basic character set was 256 ISOLAT1 using the font table as set in
    the users own font. Unicode came in for version 7+ but the fear of change and
    lack of knowledge and availability of unicode fonts, and the fact it would change
    behaviours of kerning and ligatures (therefore line endings) made few typesetters
    want to change over existing templates. New templates however should have made
    this a breeze! :)\r\n\r\nAny further info i can help you with on 3B2 (now Arbortext
