    He designed Syntax, among plenty other fonts. There is a lot of information about
    him on the net, mostly on German though. He must be in his eighties by now, but
    has still been working until lately.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nFlorian"

    'Meyer' in the book's index (which could be a mistake) but there is also there
    a Christmas card by Meyer and there the name is written 'Meyer'. So, I think it
    is a different person."

    lot of Meiers and Meyers (and Maiers, Mayers, Mairs, Mayrs etc. pp.) in Switzerland."

    \u2018the book\u2019, how are the book and the Christmas card linked and how do
    you know that the person who wrote the Christmas card (\u2018Hans Meyer-Honegger\u2019
    rather than \u2018H. Ed Meyer\u2019) was a Swiss lettering artist and designer
    from the \u201950s?  "

    named Hans Meyer-Honegger, who apparently wrote some articles about nordic runes.
    At least to me, as a \xBBSwiss lettering artist\xAB of that name, he is completely
    unknown. But I look forward to hear more about your \u203Ainvestigation\u2039.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nFlorian
