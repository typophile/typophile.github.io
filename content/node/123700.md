  \"KERNING\"\r\nClarification: I do not mean to large text or entire paragraphs,
  I mean words of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg logo)\r\n\r\nI try to find a professional
  technique or a good technique to help me put a good KERNING.\r\n\r\nI know there
  is KERNING button on Ps and Ai, but for what I need I think it would be more correct
  and professional do otherwise.\r\n\r\nI know pages as Myfonts and FontShop among
  many others, and I realized that in these pages is has a default KERNING system
  that apparently is very well placed on purpose.\r\n\r\nFor example when writing
  the word YELLOW in Ai and place the button OPTIC KERNING the result is very different
  from writing the word YELLOW at MyFonts, the KERNING is very different this much
  better placed in Myfonts.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that not all sources are in Myfonts
  or those familiar pages.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with a technique or method to
  place an excellent KERNING? (read second paragraph please)\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  infinitely.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Metric kerning relies on a typeface\u2019s internal metric data, as determined
    by the typeface designer, to space letters. Optical kerning adjusts spacing based
    on general letter shapes. Here\u2019s a good discussion of the two with examples,
    plus links to references:\r\nhttp://type-ed.com/2013/12/08/metrics-vs-optical/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I found Jan Tschichold\u2019s <cite>Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering</cite>
    (1932) to be a useful resource for  understanding how kerning should work; his
    examples of uppercase and lowercase kerning are fairly straightforward. The basic
    principles still apply to digital type."

  body: "RE: AzizMostafa ...  Arabic? no no, this is for  Sans, Sans Serif, Displays
    fonts, headers texts. (words of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg logo))\r\n\r\nRE:
    kthomps5 ...  The secluded provides a good explanation, gives his point of view,
    and causes us to provide our own discretion, but ... does not explain any independent
    technique to the OPTIK-KERNING button.\r\n\r\nA clear example that caught my attention
    is the logo of typophile (sans), can opservar the KERNING is very good, in fact
    I think it was done manually,  \r\nDoes anyone know some manual technique for
    correct placement KERNING on a logo to achieve similar results?  (See image)\r\n\r\nhttp://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t566/e390781/TypophileTwitter_zpszbxvgfsy.png\r\n\r\nI
    know that the spacing is a matter of taste of the designer, but for example when
    writing a YELLOW word first distance is specified, then the first letter of the
    second are well adjusted, but all others must be set equal to have logical coherence,\r\nWhat
    if it is done manually as you can reach a solution professional?\r\n\r\nSo the
    question is: Some techniques for MANUAL KERNING?\r\nwords of 3 to 10 characters
    maximum (eg a logo, a title, a word, a header star)\r\n\r\nThis topic fascinates
    me a lot, but so far have found very little, hope your help me Please.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "RE: kthomps5 \r\nOk, very very good, yes, this is exactly what I need.\r\nNow,
    one has to scoring fit in white letters,\r\nBut what is needed to place white
    lettering?\r\n\r\nBecause in the game we have blue letters and we have to guess
    to the white lettering.\r\n\r\nI mean, does the person who put the white letters
    that use parameters?\r\n\r\nWe can realize that first established a TRAKING to
    accommodate after KERNING.\r\n\r\nBut how well placed white lettering? (KERNING)\r\n\xBFGrope?\r\nLucky?\r\nI
    think tenie must be a technique of greater accuracy.\r\n\r\nthat's what I try
