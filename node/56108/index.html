  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm curious to see if others are observing the same anachronism that I am.
I used to take it for granted that people would type text with two word spaces after a period, because that's how you learned it on a typewriter. I patiently searched and replaced the double word spaces with single word spaces when importing text into a page layout program.
That was years ago. Now, the workforce is well-stocked with men and women who have never touched a typewriter, maybe never even seen one except in the movies. They don't know what monospaced letters are, or why such things existed. And yet . . . <em>they type two word spaces after a period.</em> It's as if they were reflexively waving their left hands at the end of every line to push a phantom carriage return (if you don't know what that is, [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp2IJIk5qvc|click here]]).
Do any of you notice this? Can any of you (especially those under 35) tell me how this archaic habit survived into the 21st Century?

		<div class="commentbody">I never typed seriously on a typewriter (only playing around as a kid on my dad's old one, but I already had a computer by that time) and I've always used two spaces.  For me, it's just another unit of division.  Book, chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence.  The double space helps me quickly (and unobtrusively) find each sentence in a paragraph, but isn't so much that it makes wide gaps.  It also makes it clear when a period is used as an abbreviation mark or as an end-of-sentence mark.  Disambiguation is rarely a bad thing, especially when it doesn't make the text look bad.  (I've never understood why people think that two spaces = unprofessional looking).

		<div class="commentbody">Cerulean, I would ask why specifically one <em>should</em> use only a single space.

Academia is open to new ideas, but only if it actually shows a benefit.  Working as a teacher now and being a child of the internet age, having sent my first e-mail in 1989 when I was 4, and programming from shortly thereafter, I'm not convinced of the benefit of computers in education (at least in foreign languages).  I was forced to use it teaching as a grad student and I saw no benefit, if anything the opposite: it was all a money-grabbing ploy by the book companies that resulted in extra work for everyone with no extra benefit. *

For me the only benefit with one space was to crunch an extra letter or two per line in a newspaper or magazina, something that didn't have much importance most other print media.  So, it's always seemed to me an economic decision instead of an aesthetic.  That or an arbitrary rule.  I'm sure every now and then I'll use a single space or a space and a half if it looks better given the font.

		<div class="commentbody">One good reason against using a longer sentence space is obviously to produce an even color in the textblock. But most young students, even today, are taught by their teachers to double the word space--as if the period and following capital letter weren't a sure enough sign. 

But the doublespace is not just a typewriter thing. I've seen it in a number of older books. Many of my philosophy books have a larger sentence space. But if you'll notice, most books set on composition machines seem to have a wider average word space then texts set on computers. Modern texts seem to have a word space of about 6- to 4-to-em spaces, while it is not uncommon to see 3-to-em and wider on the older books. I find that this gappy word spacing actually makes the wider sentence spaces seem <em>less</em> noticeable, since the ratio of normal to wide appears less than with the tighter spacing.

I suppose if you thought it were important to make the beginnings of a sentence visibly obvious when scanning the page--I can't think of a situation in which this would be important--then you might want to keep that second space. But if the document is something which lends itself to continuous reading, such as a novel, I'm not sure that one could defend it except by appeal to subjective preference.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it is a matter of custom, of audience. Like so many things, this custom isn't simply a "national" matter.

When I started setting type, the 4-5-7 rule was in effect for the value of the word spacing used to set justified copy. That's 4 to 7 units of space, using an 18-unit em. Anyway, we got a literary journal to set. My now-wife was in charge of design and production, and agreed to a simple test. I set an article using 4-5-7 spacing, and reset it, using 5-6-8 spacing. The design people at the press were asked which they preferred; all of them preferred the 4-5-7. Then the editorial people were asked which they preferred. They preferred the 5-6-8 spacing.

There are any number of such examples, but at most publishing houses, the aesthetic of the design & production people rules, for the simple reason that they are the ones who control paying for manufacturing -- or increasingly today, do the work. The larger audience doesn't get a voice.

It could even have come from one of the early manuals or tutorials with PostScript fonts, from Aldus PageMaker documentation or Adobe Type. When we marked up manuscripts for setting here, we did not worry about this, as it was the domain of the typesetters. It was only after word-processors and desktop type & layout arrived, that a designer had to know this.

Matthew, you nailed it! However, the current local usage here is that most of these do not use the full stop anymore as long as the last letter of the word and the contraction coincide. So, its Dr Roberts and Mrs Roberts anyway, and no problem. And Times St and Hevetica Rd and Gotham Bld and Museo Ave and St Typophile Church on the summit of Mt Argument. </div>

So, how about initials -- like G. E. M. Anscombe? You drop the periods here, too? BTW, Chicago style (U.S. academic) requires a space between such initials. So if you have to set, say, W. A. Smith, P. A. Jones, etc., there is a hell of a gap between the initials.

In some ways, things are worse with modern thinking: where the space can have a kern, you can really get things mucked up with some constructions. Kerning with three letters rather than pairs only might solve some of that, with the expense of a lot of kerning work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bringhurst--the Elements of Typographic Style--and Felici--the Complete Manual of Typography--strongly reject double spaces after sentences. The Chicago Manual of Style rules against them as well--both in manuscripts and in final publication. 

I agree. I think it only made sense: 1. In trying to make high contrast 'modern' typefaces in the 19th century, which were relatively unreadable, more readable in extended text. 2. When using monospaced typewriters, or monospaced fonts that imitate them. 

Because of the big space around a period, and the following cap, one word space between sentences still gives plenty of space to distinguish it from a normal word space. You could argue for slightly more, I suppose, but I just can't see a full extra word space as defensible.  

There is such unanimity on this, at least in English, and has such a force of logic behind it--you put unnecessarily big holes in the text--that I think to double word space after sentences at this point in time is a blunder to be avoided.

Being both an editor and a typesetter, I make a compromise on this (and on some similar issues, like ellipses). I use thin spaces or sixth spaces, depending on the typeface. I've found that it makes enough space that other editors won't object (or haven't so far, anyway), while keeping the gaps within reason.</div>

I've not read the whole thread - but today there's a good chance the text you write in proportional fonts is going to end up in some "plain-text" format displayed in a  fixed pitch font as it whizzes across the interwebs - most notably in email (or when cut and pasted into the Typophile's edit window). So maybe double spacing is good insurance for that.

However, if the text were like this: "Just then I went to talk with the Dr. Roberts was waiting outside. So I had to make it quick ..." the reader would definitely be confused. Is ruining page colour worth it for such rare circumstances?

Nobody's mentioned it, so I think I will. I believe TeX allows you to adjust the sentence space to be a proportion of the regular word space. This allows for spaces to be, say, 1.5 the regular word space, which can look quite nice, depending on the typographic context. Ah, so many wonderful features in TeX ... if all you're setting is text. 

I wonder if anyone's ever made a font that has two periods, one for names and one for abbreviations, to help avoid reader confusion? And while we're at it, let's distinguish commas from single brackets already—they have two different meanings!—But I digress :)</div>

TeX is surprisingly nice for typography, especially XeTeX which supports a large range of OpenType features.  Sad that most people just default to computer modern.

Seconded. I've seen the double space used quite a bit on usenet and in e-mail, and especially by mostly very young people who prefer to type in lowercase only. 
In that context, the double space really helps in that you can actually see where a sentence begins.</div>

preventing such bad breaks is the typesetters responsibility, not the font makers.

@ All of you,

There seems to be a profound difference in thinking between many people who make type, and people who use type, or just read. Theory & practice, I suppose, but the world is better when the two are close to each other.

As for not using a space between initials: Quick, how many of you kern the period after a W, T, V, etc.? Most everybody. And a number of fonts I've seen have the period kerned so tightly the advance after the period places the next character closer to a "W+period" sequence than to a plain "W". Now, how many of you also kern a period going *into* W, V, T, etc? Not as many, but some.

All right, with such kerning, set "T.T.", "T.W." "W.W." etc. and watch things overlap.

* * *

I too tried using the thin space between initials, and about the 5th book, got some "P.E.--use equal space" with the space between initials and a word space circled. Just because editors don't agree with you doesn't mean they don't have a good eye.

Likely these were on looser lines, which are sometimes unavoidable (like when "strengthen" is trying to be the last word on the first line of a paragraph). But occasionally, you wind up using a word space smaller than a thin space in a justified setting, and the the thin-spaced initials again stick out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I imagine that a reader who is neither a typographer nor a type designer would either notice or care if word and sentence spaces are are easy to distinguish, at least not while reading. Just like many people don't notice whether there's space around a dash or not, or whether letters are perfectly spaced, and other subtle things like that. It seems to me that even collisions in combinations like "T.T" and "T.V" are more of a concern for typographers than readers. Would I care if I saw such a collision? Of course! Would many others? Probably not. So I guess it is up to the preference of who ever is paying the bill or whoever controls the typesetting choices. I can definitely see the advantage from a functional, as opposed to aesthetic, perspective of using a wider word space. But I've never heard anyone who wasn't involved in type-related fields ever mention that they wish typeset materials would return to the wider space, or that the continuous word spacing poses a challenge to their reading.

I'm finding this really interesting. I had always just dogmatically assumed a preference for consistent spaces for everything but abbreviations, where I prefer thin spaces. But I typeset using mostly my own fonts, which are kerned to accommodate this usage. It seems that there is a stronger argument for using wider sentence spaces than I thought! Although I do think a ratio of 1.5:1 would be greatly preferable to 2:1.</div>

Typing in lower case only is a sign of callow youth that thinks it's discovered a better way, and are going to teach their elders. They generally wise up after some time. 

The most serious effort at no caps was the Bayer, whose desire to do away with caps was a part of the movement in Germany to reject Blackletter, without simply imitating the rest of Europe. The idea was to use only all sans, no caps. (German capitalizes all nouns as well as beginnings of sentences.) It flopped also, though the Bauhaus effort to establish sans as useful in text has won out as an option.

Lowercase-only is a much worse practice than double spacing after sentences, because it slows the reader down by removing an expected symbol of the beginning of a new sentence.

It's interesting that TeX enables you to adjust space after sentences. I assume you have to tell the computer that a sentence has ended, as I don't know how you could distinguish an initial or abbreviation from a sentence end otherwise. 

You can also play with this in InDesign using an additional thin space after sentences. I just can't see a double space as an improvement, except for monospaced fonts--and honestly I don't even see a double space as helping there either, because the period takes such a huge "M" space in a monospaced font anyway. 

Charles, I think over kerning of punctuation, such as is done in Minion, is a bad idea. It seems that Slimbach, who is great otherwise, has thought better of it in more recent fonts, though I don't have them myself, to check in detail. 

Speaking of thin spaces, do you have an opinion on what thin space is most useful? I read thin spaces as 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6 em. What is best?  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill (as I take a break from placing 95 pictures with long captions in a 700+ page book), I don't think there is any answer. If you ask an old Linotype operator, he'd tell you that a thin space is an unexpanded spaceband -- about 2 points if you are using thin spacebands. Of course, the Linotype linecaster wasn't on the em-system; a Monotype operator would give a different answer.

With modern computer fonts, back from the days when I was using TeX, I've used 155 units (1,000 unit em) for a thin space. I've been edging downward; sometimes using as little as 100 units. For me, a thin space should be recognizably smaller that the smallest wordspace that could occur with a justified setting. Obviously, with condensed fonts you need a correspondingly smaller value for a useful thinspace.

What I put in Unicode 2009 depends on the font and it's nominal wordspace. I'm having to adjust -- TeX wordspaces are not characters, and you can program whatever you want for other spaces more or less "on the fly." InDesign requires both to be "in the font."

My starting point is a thinspace (2009) about 150 units, with a hairspace (200A) about 55 units.

BTW, we never used "French spacing" with TeX, but there is a way to signal when to use it in the file. Offhand, I can't remember just how.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is one of my biggest pet peeves. The main reason it is still happening is because teachers are still teaching it despite the fact that many manuals of style have changed to the 1 space rule. If you don't believe me (or my sources in graphic design training), check with the "goddesses of all things editorial" The Chicago Manual of Style. 

For those of you who asked why one space is better or necessary really surprise me. Perhaps you aren't designers or typesetters, but this was something I was taught back in Design 101. Two spaces after a period is only necessary and required on a typewriter or a font like Courier (which you hopefully aren't using). It does not look better with 2 spaces. Books are not professionally set with two spaces, even when typewriters were the big dogs, since books were laid out and printed on a press. Pull down any book on your shelf—you won't find two spaces between sentences. We don't need the extra space to tell us when a new sentence has started. Now, with the creation of fonts and computers, the extra space is actually distracting. If you are a designer, especially a layout designer, you should know and vehemently follow this. It isn't a matter of whether or not people are actually going to notice or care. The premise of graphic design in the first place is to do something so beautiful that the design disappears and the content takes precedence. Design should never be distracting.</div>

further, i agree with the poster above who said that

(actually, i think 1.25 is probably even big enough.
yes, 2 times bigger is _far_ too big.  but it's better
to go even that far than not to have any difference.)

i only use one space at the end of a sentence _when_

"even color" is good, but when it misleads a reader to
poorer recognition of the presence of a new sentence,
it's not doing its job.  it's not the only value out there.
any kind of a break -- e.g., paragraph indent -- is the
correct place to introduce an extra bit of whitespace...

I, like most people, was taught a lot of things as an undergraduate, and then learned better in grad school and in the real world.  The saying as you know is you need to know the rules to break them (to an extent, of course :) ). 

But since you quote the Chicago Manual of Style, I'll kindly note that the Modern Language Association whose format I almost universally have to use, allows either style.

1.5 is probably best, though in quick correspondence or draft copies, I find 2 spaces to be preferable to 1 (plus, if you want to go back and mass change when prepping a final document, it's easier to go 2->1.5 instead of 1->1.5)

Indeed, Charles, there was a way to get very thin spacing on a Monotype. Late-model machines employed a feature called "unit adding." With this one could add space to the right side of the last letter in a word and delete the word space following. This could give very thin space between words.

There was also the possibility to subtract units from the body of some sorts and thus achieve, for instance, a kerned Wa combination right off the caster. In large display that was a huge bonus because the hand comp would not have to fiddle with the saw to make the kern.

Exactly how unit adding worked in concert with the Monotype's justifying system I do not know. I never learned the unit adding technique because my time as a Mono keyboarder was pretty short. Good keyboard operators could make great looking lines of type with these and some other tricks. I hope someone is teaching these tricks to the hardy band of young folks who are learning Monotypes today.

ok, good.  thanks.

now let me be a bit more specific.

although bringhurst doesn't see any need for sentence-space
that's larger than the normal word-space, the _default_ in tex
is for an enlarged sentence-space, is it not?

and, to prevent this from happening incorrectly mid-sentence,
the exception to this is when the word which is terminated with
a period is capitalized, the assumption being it's an abbreviation?

indeed, the mere fact that the term "sentence-space" _exists_
means typographers differentiate it from "word-space", not?

the /frenchspacing declaration turns the tex default _off_, not?
which implies a sentence-space is expected _in_english_, not?

so i guess the more specific form of the question would be "what
_percentage_ of book-designers use an enlarged sentence-space?"

note that by "enlarged", i emphatically do _not_ mean twice as large.

and a follow-up question would be, "has this percentage changed
in the last 100 years or so?"  i ask this because i'm accustomed to
working with public-domain texts, and i'm quite certain that these
older books did indeed typically use an enlarged sentence-space.

i also find it amusing you think i am "young" and a "hipster"...
i'm probably older than you are, and probably...  well i probably
_am_ hipper than you, but i'm not sure how you would gauge it.

i reject quite a bit of "traditional stuff", because it's _stupid_.

but i decline to use capital letters purely as an artistic statement.
(well, the fact that capital letters are _ugly_ plays a part as well.)

there are times when it would be handy to use some uppercase.
i look at those times as accepting a constraint voluntarily, which
is a good thing for an artist to do.  (or anyone else, for that matter.)


>   sometimes refer back to something as quaint 
>   as the typewriter habit of double spaces

as other people have pointed out, we see a use for an enlarged
sentence-space -- and it's worth noting that we've specified that
we don't need that sentence-space to be _twice_ as large as the
word-space -- so it's not accurate to describe it as being "quaint".

besides, if you grant that it's needed in the _typewriter_ situation,
then it's worth noting that many of our current situations haven't
morphed completely out of that situation, like monospaced e-mail.
(i haven't used monospace in my e-mail for the last 25 years myself,
but some people -- including even here, i bet -- use it to this day.)


>   like a last faint attempt to make their sentences readable… 
>   (See, our very own lowercase bird does this too.)

it _does_ make my sentences more readable, since i'm missing the
capital-letter at the start of a new sentence, which is the biggest tip.

but i think the enlarged sentence-space makes text more readable
even if one uses the standard casing, by marking sentence-endings.

still, you wouldn't know i use two spaces unless i had told you, since
the browser regards the second space as something nonsignificant...
(unless you have a weird habit of doing "view source" on these pages.)

Assuming that the former is true, then the answer to the latter would probably be approximately the percentage of book-designers (or more properly, "compositors" -- who may or may not be the designers) who use some version of TeX.

Which I believe is pretty small (no offense to TeX users, Steve Peters, or Charles E intended). Perhaps someone will refute this.

However, I think <em>most</em> people don't do it as an artistic statement, but out of laziness: no need to hit the shift key and the letter key at the same time (phew!).

But other than with TeX, which almost no one uses anymore, there is no straightforward way to automate this kind of spacing that I know of. I guess rather than use a space and a thin space, one could use an en space for sentences. But you'd still have to check each one in the document on replace, and I don't think I'd do that by choice if I were typesetting a long document.</div>

we live with it.  if we got upset about the flaws in our tools

we would all end up sour and bitter, like some people here.

p.s. my tools used to require two spaces to get an enlarged
sentence-space, but it was too much work for the author...
so now the tool enlarges the sentence-space automatically,
provided, of course, the reader has requested that option...
that way an author can just collapse all double-spaces to
a single-space, which makes text-preparation much easier.

		<div class="commentbody">It would be interesting to find out when use of the double space–or a space larger than the justifying word space–was abandoned by typesetters. I took a random look at books from the 1840s through the 1940s and found these uses of larger spaces after a period.

1847 London; 1860 London; 1908 St. Paul, Minnesota; 1929 Washington, D.C.; 1941 Chicago.

The 1847 and 1860 were of course set by hand. The 20th century titles were all machine-set.

So in England and the US the larger space was used before the typewriter, as Nepenthe suggested, and it lingered well after the establishment of a caste of professional Linotype and Monotype operators.

I also looked at my Horace printed by Firmin Didot in Paris in the 1830s or 1850s. The space following a period is the same as the internal word spaces. [I'm sorry about the date. It was 5.30 a.m., and that type is really small. Even with a magnifier I could not make out the date. I was not awake, really, but I was pestered by this question.]

I think your chronology is a bit myopic. You'll want to expand your view if you want to ascertain general practice. 

While TeX did precede InDesign (in its current configuration), it was never a broadly established standard (not that I'm aware of), although some aspects of it have been very influential, and it has found an established place within certain niches of publishing. 

There have been several alternative page-composition softwares, all relatively contemporaneous (in the grand scheme of typesetting), many proprietary. I don't know what the default might have been in all of them with regard to "sentence-spaces." But I somehow doubt that inherently wider sentence spaces are a common behavior.

And I think we still have yet to confirm that this difference, while evidently possible, is in fact the default behavior in TeX. Perhaps Charles or Steve or someone with practical experience can confirm or deny.

Your chronology seems to imply that there was one accepted default, and then that default got changed recently.

If you want to trace the evolution of sentence spacing from a technological standpoint, you'll want to look back to phototypesetting systems and their default behaviors. There are folks around here who used Compugraphics, for instance. I could ask my brother, if none come forward to explain that default.

Prior to that, you'd have to look at Linotype and Monotype. I know Linotype did not have a default mechanism for having sentence spaces distinct (wider or otherwise) from word spacing. Any variation would have been the style of the composition house, accomplished manually. One might be able to find exceptions, such as the 1941 Chicago example that Will cites, but I believe "single" spacing was more the norm. I'm not as familiar with Monotype composition (Will is), but I believe again that distinctly different spacing between sentences was not any kind of default behavior or norm.

The original TeX was set up to Knuth's tastes, and had slightly more space at sentence ends by default. (It was, however, <em>not</em> a double space (unless you were using the typewriter font), but rather a percentage, and that space was subject to more stretching when justifying the line.)

		<div class="commentbody">Here's Bringhurst on the double spacing between sentences:

"In the nineteenth century, which was a dark and inflationary age in typography and type design, many compositors were encouraged to stuff extra space between sentences."

He does, however, support extra space between sentences in languages with no caps.

I wonder how good his history is. In Harry Carter's A View of Early Typography I see in the famous Berner specimen of Garamond (1592) there are extra spaces between sentences. And Carter shows hand written manuscripts of humanist hands where there is also extra space between sentences. So contrary to what I said above, which I guess I got from Bringhurst, it does seem to be a practice much older than 19th century.

		<div class="commentbody">I always thought the reason why this practice became deprecated was that, once "word-wrap" and justification became possible with the invention of word-processing in say the late 1970's, there was the strong possibility of a line ending falling within either of those two spaces.

That would result in the auto-created-return replacing one of them, with the other left at the end of the previous line (or perhaps the beginning of the next) spoiling the neat justification!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I said above, tastes and practices in spacing ebb and flow. Bill, the wider sentence space certainly goes back before the 19th century, despite what Bringhurst's statement might imply (though I suspect that wasn't necessarily his intention).

You can find plenty of examples scattered throughout Updike. My cursory impression is that the practice begins to emerge in the 18th century and perhaps reaches its zenith in the late 19th.

In terms of practicality, I would imagine that in hand setting, it's much easier to justify a line by throwing any leftover space into a single sentence division than adding it judiciously to all word spaces. In machine setting, there is no such labor advantage, since the mechanisms are set up to distribute space evenly by mechanical (or computational) means.</div>

so here we have an acknowledgment that this was "common".

that accords with my experience with public-domain books,
which is anything that predates 1923.

that's exactly what i'm trying to do, kent,

interacting with people like you.

i'm not here to defend Tex.  i don't know it, or use it.
never have, and never will.  (i cut my d.t.p. teeth on
ventura publisher.)  nonetheless, knuth is respected,
big-time, and it certainly seems to me that he did his
homework.  thus if he made it the _default_behavior_
that a sentence-space was larger than a word-space,
then it was because typographers of that time did too.

again, i myself prefer a slightly enlarged sentence-space,
but what i happen to prefer is not the important issue here.

again, i'm just collecting information, not engaging in an
"argument", but right up above you quoted someone who
said that -- in 1924, at least -- wide spacing _was_ "common".

now, 1924 was a long time ago, so i believe it could've changed,
and i'm not even saying that it hasn't -- if i knew all the facts,
i wouldn't be here asking about them -- but again, the setting of
a default in systems like tex is a piece of information in the puzzle.

and tex wasn't the only one.  groff also had a "sentence-space".
and the term certainly isn't unknown to google, where it usually
goes by "end of sentence space", if you want to narrow it down...


>   And I think we still have yet to confirm that this difference,
>   while evidently possible, is in fact the default behavior in TeX.

maybe _you_ haven't confirmed it.  but it's easy enough to do;
look up the "frenchspacing" declaration and you will see clearly.

but pay attention that i weight your opinion very heavily here...
i see you market your services very clearly as a _book_ designer,
not a font designer, a graphic designer, or a plain "designer", and
that's an important consideration to me and my research here...

i'm seeking information on what "most" book-designers think,
not just on this question, but on the whole gamut of questions,
and since you are one, that's valuable.  still, you're "just" one...

so i'm waiting for more people to weigh in, or for you to give me
more information that shows that other book-designers agree...

and the resistance i see from you -- slight, yes, but it _is_ there,
if you are willing to question something so easy to verify as the
default setting in a well-known typesetting program -- is telling.


>   Your chronology seems to imply that 
>   there was one accepted default, and then 
>   that default got changed recently.

well, i've looked at a _lot_ of public-domain scan-sets, and
it's usually pretty easy to see that they used expanded spacing
at the beginning of sentences.  but they also often put spacing
between quotemarks and the words they were "attached" to,
so a lot of "standards" have changed across the years, certainly.

as for tex, there was indeed "one accepted default", but no,
that default has _not_ "got changed recently".  it's the same.

now, maybe that's a legacy default, and every tex user around
curses to themselves that they still have to change that default.
i don't know.  and that's not even what i care about, not really.

what i want to know is, if you polled all the book-designers,
asking them about this matter, what would the results show?

in the absence of such a poll, i just have to look at the books.
the thing is, with justified text, it's relatively difficult to tell...

but i can tell you that, even up to present-day books, i have
seen some that appear to have an enlarged sentence-space.

because of the copyright mess we're in, it's quite difficult
to examine books from the last 50 years or so, because
even if they've been scanned, their scans aren't viewable.

(and, if you want to get a more definitive answer to this,
you need to have a program that actually computes the
size of the spaces within each line, which requires a scan.)

i'm not really interested in the history.  i want to know the
current mindset of the current crop of book-designers...
(and, if i can narrow it further, the _good_ book-designers.)

so when you tell me what you do, and charles_e says that he 
won't even take a job if he'd have to use a sentence-space,
that's exactly the kind of information i want.  i don't need
anything more besides that.  i mean, i think the discussion
is _fun_, so i'm happy to take part, but i don't really need it.

and i think that's the point here.  the practice _was_ common.
which is why these guys are giving their advice _not_ to do it...

indeed, when they use spin like "dark and inflationary age",
it makes it seem like the practice might have been pervasive.      ;+)

i couldn't say much about books that predate the 19th century,
because i haven't looked at that many, and the ones i have seen
are pretty much a hodge-podge on a wide variety of variables...

but i will dispute that the practice died out in the 19th century.
the public-domain books i've looked at run right up to 1923 --
and, because of the growth of publishing, there are a lot more
that are _closer_ to that 1923 cutoff than _farther_ from it --
and i'd say the vast majority use an expanded sentence-space.
so the practice was strong 1/4 of the way into the 20th century.

now, i haven't _measured_ it, in the way that i described above,
so that's just my _impression_, but a big part of the reason that
i never measured is that it's so obvious, i never felt that i had to.
(another big part of the reason is because it's largely irrelevant to
the question about what we will choose to do in the 21st century.)

anyway, here's yet another long post that people will throw darts
at me because i've written.  oh well, so be it.  and my apologies to
the original poster, if that person thinks i "hijacked" their thread.
(although, on looking back, it seems that they were just venting.)

“The period is put next to the last letter of the sentence <strong>without any spacing</strong>, and is followed by a [single] word space.

I'm not sure I understand the thrust of this statement. I have no problem saying plainly that Yes, I am resistant to the idea of wider sentence spaces in contemporary practice. It is not slight. 

I questioned the default in TeX because I have no practical experience with that program and have no access to it. Until Steve answered my question, I had heard no direct evidence that wider sentence spacing was the default, only that it was easily achieved if one cared to.


<cite> > thus if he made it the _default_behavior_ that a sentence-space was larger than a word-space, then it was because typographers of that time did too.</cite>

This is exactly the assumption that I'm challenging. I believe that you are drawing a conclusion that is not borne out.

<cite> > but right up above you quoted someone who said that — in 1924, at least — wide spacing _was_ “common”.</cite>

I don't think anyone is saying that there wasn't a period of time when wide spacing was common. Yes, from about the 18th century to the first quarter of the 20th. It was then railed against by many in the field, it was viewed as lazy and unsophisticated, and the common practice changed. 

I maintain that through the majority of the 20th century it was not common. I've tried to give evidence of some prominent practitioners who have since dismissed that style. I've outlined that it was not a practical approach within the prevalent methods of book composition in the 20th century, even up to the 1980s, when Knuth developed TeX. But . . . 

<cite> > i’m not really interested in the history. i want to know the current mindset of the current crop of book-designers...</cite>

So you must forgive me, because I am historical by temperament.

You have my opinion. I am not able to speak for my colleagues and can offer no proof except a library full of contemporary examples in which no extra spacing is added between sentences.

Now I will sit back and wait with you to see if any other book designers care to offer their opinions on the matter.</div>

ok, unless someone else chips in to say that they _do_
use a larger space, let's consider the question resolved.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">What I know of Knuth and TeX is what I learned, mostly by word of mouth, supervising a production team for a publisher that specialized in mathematics, engineering, and physical sciences. Here's the story as I understand it.
In the 1970s, authors composed their manuscripts on typewriters and submitted them to publishers, who sent them out to typesetting shops to make them ready for printing. The workers in the typesetting shops were generally not experts in mathematics, and often made mistakes, which resulted in tedious rounds of proofreading and correction. Sometimes, typesetters' errors slipped through the proofreading cycle and made their way into published books and journals, to the great embarrassment of the authors. 
That was the problem Knuth set out to fix. He developed TeX so scientists and scholars could typeset their own books and articles, thus keeping them out of the hands of typesetters who might introduce errors. (The fact that this also saved time and money was just gravy.)
To judge from the work I've seen by technical authors working in TeX, Knuth wasn't overly concerned with the aesthetics of design. His goal was to give authors control over the way their pages look: not how a <strong>designer</strong> wants them to look, but how a <strong>mathematician</strong> wants them to look.
Every new technology starts out by mimicking the technology it's superseding (think of the spirited exchange that recently occurred on this site regarding justified type in ebooks). Before Knuth gave them TeX, his users were using <strong>typewriters</strong>. If TeX defaults to extra space between sentences, my guess is that Knuth did it that way because that's what his target market was accustomed to.</div>

i think you're severely underestimating the research that
knuth did to make sure tex was acceptable to typesetters.

not to mention the zeal with which they used his creation,
or the passion with which they defend the output from it.

i think they're cultists, don't get me wrong, but there was
a certain level of authenticity achieved to create that cult.

a great example.  that discussion gave me the impression
that ragged-right is considered acceptable by people here.

but i'll bet dollars to donuts you won't find two books on
the bestseller lists today that do not have a justified body.

and i'll bet donuts to donuts there isn't even _one_ there...

and hey, _my_ preference is for ragged-right, so you know.

i took it that you were questioning my veracity

i hope you can see the difference.

perhaps there's a question about knuth's reputation
lurking underneath this?  i consider him to be _very_
well-respected, and that factors into my account, yes.

however, charles_e has said that much of tex reflects
the personal opinion of knuth, and that might be true,
and this may be one of the places where that manifests.

i'm just a blind man trying to figure out the elephant,
so i hope you forgive me when i get a few things wrong.

i'm certainly not telling anyone here what's "correct".
i'm just asking you to tell me your opinions...

i'm not sure i see it as "lazy and unsophisticated",
except when used to excess to achieve justification.
otherwise, it requires as much discipline as any rule.
because it demands some attention to _semantics_,
one could even argue that it requires more discipline.
(i'm not making that argument, but someone could.)

just to resolve what might now be a confusion about
what i consider important, i do care about the history
-- especially what was included in textbooks and other
significant writing in the field -- to the extent that it is
an indication of what the typographers of today think.

ok, you've put the burden on me to find exceptions.

i'll consider any book on the bestseller lists to be
fair game, unless you flag off certain publishers
you feel employ hacks who do substandard work.

like i said, 3 out of 3 have said "no extra space",
so that's a clear-enough consensus for my needs,
so -- unless someone weighs in on the other side --
let's just consider the matter resolved for right now.

i have many questions, so let's pace ourselves...     :+)

		<div class="commentbody">Concerning TeX, the fact that authors could directly typeset their articles explains TeX's success, but it was not Knuth's aim and he had no "target market" in mind (he said so in an [[http://maps.aanhet.net/maps/pdf/16_15.pdf|interview]]: "I originally designed TeX just for myself, for <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>; I thought my secretary and I were going to be the only users"). As he explains in one of his articles (see the first article in his book <em>Digital Typography</em>), his concern was only in being able to keep the same level of quality for his multi-volume book <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> when his publisher was switching away from Monotype machines.

When designing TeX, he attempted to reproduce how the previous volumes of <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> looked. Among other things, his books used more space at the end of sentences, so he implemented it in TeX. But he went a bit further and also increased the stretchability after all punctuation marks. Here's an example from the TeXbook, chap. 12, p. 73:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tex_stretchability_4744.png]
(The space after the comma stretches 1.25 more than normal spaces, while the space after the period or the exclamation mark stretches 3 times more. Of course, for shrinking (first line), it's the contrary: spaces after punctuation shrink less.)

As already mentioned, using \frenchspacing disables these features:

		<div class="commentbody">Keep this in mind: In the last half of the 19th century, and into the early years of the 20th, many USA hand compositors were paid "by the em." That is, they were paid by the amount of type they set during a shift. So: to go faster, they paid less attention to word spacing. They used wide spaces such as 3-to-em. They threw in a whole em after a period. They paid little attention to hyphenation. They had learned in a rough-and-tumble way, on the shop floor. There was not a class of men (they would have been men then) to look over their shoulders and comment on the finer points. And there were few Tschicholds or Schmollers establishing house styles. All this was a sure-fire way to assure they'd blow out the work and give the appearance that a lot more type had been set. So economics had something to do with large spaces after periods. Not in all shops, but in very many.

During the first quarter of the 20th century the trade had come under the thoughtful influence of men (and a few women by that time) who understood how type works, and comps had been trained in more formal apprenticeships, much of that careless setting had ceased. The influence of both the Linotype and the Monotype was also important, for close setting was more easily accomplished on the machines, and hand comps had to emulate it.

By the last quarter of the century, the few hand comps left in book composing rooms were setting very little text by hand. But when we did, we were striving for close spacing, doing final justification with copper half-points and even thinner bits of paper, tissue, and card.

*******
Also: regarding this exchange: "Ask yourself: What would Bringhurst do? Then do it." A better bit of advice would be to ask what Bringhurst would do, and then to see if his suggestions hold up in the job you are doing and to your own experience of type. If what he says does not fit, then come up with your own well-considered alternate and see if it works better.

Not necessarily. It may just have been that the one or two typographers he asked preferred that. Take a look at the ugly Computer Modern typefaces that were generated when he went from typesetting to font design in his studies. Charles Bigelow was the expert he dealt with on that one, and I am not impressed with the results.</div>

that may be.  i don't know, it was
before my time.  but nonetheless,
i've done some analyses of the type
that was set in those olden days and
i've usually been blown away by the
level of accuracy that they achieved.

of course it was not to the exactitude
that computers give us today, but still,
these guys were doing this _by_hand_.

the work was laborious and tedious,
yet demanding a complete attention.

so i don't think they were sloppy at all.

quite to the contrary, their precision
in this manual process was incredible,
at least in my opinion...  i could never
do it.  but they did, on a regular basis.

I've found that even with a digital version of the same face, it's impossible to tweak H&J settings to produce the same spacing and word breaks.
In particular, I've found that in justified setting, the word spacing was on average waaaay larger than today. 
So in that kind of setting, where a column of text would include many very wide spaces between words, it would be problematic to have a single space as the default between sentences, as it would look strange if the sentence break happened to fall in a line that was tightly spaced. It would draw attention to the visual disparity of pacing in the flow of meaning.

Also, bear in mind that sentences were longer back in the day, and there were fewer paragraph breaks.
So a good heavy capital letter at the beginning of sentences, preceded by an ample amount of space, served to enliven the reading experience.</div>

are you sure it wasn't "waaaaaaaay" larger than today?        ;+)

yeah, it's pretty easy to notice that.  they also used much
bigger margins.  today's bottom-line publishers like to
squeeze in as much type on a page as they possibly can,
especially in the airport-bookstore mass-market slabs...

somewhere between the oceans of whitespace and the
desert of a too-full page, there _is_ a happy medium...

makes sense.  it's also the case that when your wordspace
has already grown to be huge, because of the justification,
you'd be better off adding a little more slack to a "logical"
place -- like the end of a sentence -- than making every
single wordspace in that line even _bigger_...

it's not that you're being "critical".

it's that your criticism doesn't jibe with what we know
to be true about knuth, which is that he is meticulous.
people who are fussy about details are fussy about _all_
of them, not just some of them, or even most of them...

it's simply not believable that he consulted a world-class
expert like zapf, and then -- when it came to one thing,
sentence spacing -- he decided to _ignore_ that master.

"oh yeah, that hermann, you know how he can be about
his 'even spacing', sometimes that's all he can talk about,
especially once he gets some jagermeister in him, so we
just had to cart him to bed so we could do as we pleased."

i mean, it _could_ be true.  it just doesn't _ring_ true...

***

at any rate, you've convinced me that today's designers
do _not_ use an enlarged sentence-space, that you are
_totally_opposed_ to doing it, even if your tools allowed,
and they do not, so i'm _fully_ willing to believe that this
practice existed in the past and in the past only, and that
is all i wanted to know, so let's put this topic to bed, ok?        :+)

if there's any last word you want to get in, please do,

No, I meant the "single" space in a particular line, whatever its absolute dimension is. In relation to that, the "sentence space" would be greater.

Compare these two pages.

The first is a straight scan from a book published in 1925, set in a Scotch Modern, complete with extra sentence space, to the order of 2½--3½ times the width of the other spaces in the line. (Actually, that introduces another reason for extra space here--it's a good place to pad out the line for justification, as there is some leeway, because there is unlikely to be another sentence space nearby, which in comparison would draw attention to discrepencies in the proportion of the sentence space.)

In the second image, I have adjusted the lines with sentence breaks so that the sentence space is the same as the word spaces. 

Does this comparison support my contention that a larger sentence space creates a more interesting page of text, when there are long sentences and no paragraph breaks?

I must say it makes me rethink the issue, because a lot of them look pretty damn good. But they all have lines closely spaced. 

So I think that the issue of sentence spacing is connected to the overall layout. When the lines are tight, it is harder to scan for sentence beginning, and also the grey is rather dense, so maybe the sentence spacing helps with both problems, which you don't have with more leading.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. Such heated discussion over a seemingly simple issue.

I will tell you that I've never set a page where two spaces came after sentences, and I remove them when I get copy that has it. But I have purposely used such things for effect, as in a personal email. I also use all lowercase a lot in that context. I really don't think about it when typing with upper-case first letters for the beginning of sentences and proper nouns. But then again, I don't think about it when I'm not.

I should let you all in on a little secret. I don't use no capital letter to be revolutionary or spiteful, or thinking that I can teach the old guys. Sometimes it just represents laziness, business, or that you're in a real hurry. If I'm especially sad or emo, I don't <em>want</em> to use capital letters. Like when you're VERY ANGRY you feel like only capitals are better for that context.

And I use extra word spaces, and weird uses of carriage returns, slashes, ellipses, and so on for breaths, breaks, dramatic pauses, and whatever else I feel like. 

But on some forums and formal (or less personal) correspondence I never do this. Most people I know that's between 12 and 20 tend to do this same thing.

Also, it's annoying when Typophile removes my extra carriage returns.
