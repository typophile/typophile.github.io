  working. I have individual ttfs for all the different \u201Cversions\u201D of the
  font, MrsEaves (MrsEavesRoman, MrsEavesItalic, MrsEavesAllSmallCaps, MrsEavesSmallCaps
  and MrsEavesPetiteCaps)  MrsEavesSmallCaps, MrsEavesPetiteCaps and MrsEavesRoman
  take on the identity of MrsEavesItalic when previewed. Any idea why the other 2
  would work fine but those 3 do not? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

    when I was messing around with a font converting application to see if it really
    worked that easily.

    the fonts, in which case you should run and hide. ;-)
