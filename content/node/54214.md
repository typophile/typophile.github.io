  my own website.\r\nI just need a very simple license and don't really have the money
  to pay a lawyer hundreds of dollars to put one together. However I can't find anything
  online that I can just use as my own. Any suggestions??\r\n"

    Commercial use? Do you want to let people make changes to your face? And so forth."

    I don't care what it is used on, even on products or commercial design. I mainly
    just don't want someone to resell the font or something like that."

    up with will be perfect! For my little site I just couldn't see getting all complicated
    with tons of legal jargon.\r\n"
