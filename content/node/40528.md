    i was much too late? Maybe with a programmed timer, 24 hours range or less like
    you guys want.\r\n\r\nThomas "

  body: "Ugh, it's so annoying when people post links to images instead of inserting
    the image here. \r\n\r\nFor one, I'm barred from opening hosting sites like Imageshack
    at work. Secondly, not inserting images degradates the \"historical\" properties
    of posting here.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant."

    Punchcut folks, who do a great job, but forget those of us with older browsers
    (although I am happy to say I now have the latest Mac OS, I was still unable to
    post an image the other day).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
