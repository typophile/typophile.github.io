body: "I have a flush left, ragged right text box. I want to make the paragraph more
  square without justifying the text but I feel like I have no control. If I decrease
  the word spacing, tracking, or kerning the 'who' only moves up the the previous
  line when things are far too close together and even then there is ample room within
  the text box for breathing room. \r\n\r\nI'm so frustrated!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ploader.net/#7c4ffd6062c894dd9c56d8d7e7107176.png\"><img

  body: "By the way, and with all due respect, you're using fake small caps in your
    example. You may want to use an OpenType font that has real small caps built in
    or a family that has a set of real small caps in a separate font file.\r\n\r\nNo
    idea what I'm talking about? Fake small caps are computer-downsized capital figures
    that look lighter/thinner than the surrounding characters. Real small caps are
    the same weight and proportion to the rest of the characters in the font file.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps..."

  body: You may also have "balance ragged lines" turned on. Search in InDesign help
    for where to find it and try turning it off.

  body: "Another point I would like to make: app. you use the standard InDesign-settings
    for H&J \u2014 where letterspacing is allowed. That is an absolute no-no for serious
    typographers. \r\n\r\nJustification can be found as an option in the Paragraph-pallette.
    Change the settings here:\r\n\r\nWord Spacing: depending on the typeface \u2014
    I mostly use around 80% Minimum, 90% Desired, 100% Maximum\r\nLetter Spacing:
    0% overall\r\nGlyph Scaling: is considered a BAD thing, but I will allow 1% either
    way (99%, 1005, 101%). \r\n\r\nAuto Leading is also BAD when set to anything else
    than 100%. You want to be in control.\r\n\r\nThis is also where you can reset
    the Composer microspective talks about."

  body: "You could always just break the lines in that paragraph manually instead
    of letting InDesign choose where to break them.\r\n\r\nUse a forced line break
    (Shift-Return) rather than a paragraph break (Return), so InDesign will know you're
    not starting a new paragraph. You may need to manually break several lines since
    InDesign may reflow other lines above and below when you insert a manual break.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of the menu) InDesign will display forced line breaks and paragraphs etc.

  body: "@Bert \u2014 You're absolutely right in suggesting those settings, but they
    shouldn't be causing the odd letterspacing since the type isn't justified. Rather,
    it looks like lvthomas has tracked out the small caps (appropriate) but has also
    applied that extended tracking to the body copy (inappropriate)."

  body: "Agreed. Although note that it only occurs sporadically, not even on a line-by-line
    basis. I don't want to take this discussion away from the issue at hand, but it's
    possible the uneven spacing may have something to do with your problem.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_5988.jpg]"

    caps [scaled caps] to me.
