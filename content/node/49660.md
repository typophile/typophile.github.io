  as the main workhorse for bulk text, correspondence, etc. I don't own it and haven't
  really used it before, at least not in this context.\r\n\r\nCan anyone comment on
  how well the OpenType version performs in day-to-day layperson use? I mean, how
  is the default character spacing, general flow of the text, etc. Does it generally
  need a lot of tweaking or can I just let it go and get good results?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nThreeDot"
