body: "I am being specific to the hamburger / cheeseburger sector on this forum though
  this concerns all burger types. I am not happy with burger retailers giving out
  burgers and warm pickles. The pickles should not be warm or rubbery. Thus the word
  burgerwithapickle is a bit too broad and a distinction should be included for educating
  that a particular burger is also a warm-pickle burger, e.g. 'A Rubberpickle-Burger'.
  This should educate and help to understand that the pickle is serious in it's objectives.
  (making a burger delicious.) I find it objectionable and corrupt that Burgers are
  using warmed pickles, de facto over-sized-relish to pass as a crispy delicious pickle.
  The pickle/burger activity is about doing things without any compromise. When you
  have a pickle on the side, burger enjoyment is generally less enjoyable, and the
  bun sometimes gets soggy, it is all quite revolting.\r\n"

    such trivial matters. Of course I'm talking about the serious subject of submarine
    sandwich shredded lettuce microwaving.

    Pickles are a garnish. "

    EULA to see if this is permissable, but the wait staff are always cool with it."

    Monsanto is working hard to bio-engineer a lettuce invisible to microwave radiation.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I respect your opinion. I don't have any issues with your wife profiting from
    your aversion to pickles. Does she save the pickles in a drawer to use on her
    next burger, or does she use them immediately like so many materialistic governments
    would have us do?"
