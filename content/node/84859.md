  eyes looking for it anywhere and could not find.\r\n\r\nCan you please help me identify
  this font?\r\n\r\nhttp://postimage.org/image/2edawf6as/\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the
  P that the stroke is different, the L which is kinda curve, the A with the stroke
  on the left above the letter. Anything.\r\n\r\nThanks a LOT."

    letter M on my font frenetic search and found Mistral, this is pretty much the
    same as the pic, though the P does not match EXACTLY, the Mistral did the job
    very well.\r\n\r\nJustin_Ch, thanks a LOT, you ROCK, elven eyes!"
