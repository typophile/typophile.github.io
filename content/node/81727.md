body: "This is the first logo I've drawn entirely from the ground up and am looking
  for some general feedback on the typography and design. It's for a company that
  will be selling clothing designed for outdoor enthusiasts and travelers. One of
  the requirements of the project is that it work well on a waistband. I took this
  to mean that it should be wide, rectangular, and not suffer too much from being
  stretched horizontally. Note that the coloration shown is simply to give it a bit
  of twinkle for presentation; I'm still experimenting with color schemes and mulling
  over any 3D treatments it might receive online. Applied to products, though, the
  color will likely be flat and solid, which means I need to produce a wordmark that
  can stand on its own, without much window dressing.\r\n\r\nI welcome any comments
  you may have. Thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrexLogo1_6357.jpg]"

  body: "I really it. The X is balanced which I know can be a little tricky.\r\nIf
    I have to say something: I'd be tempted to see how the T would look if the \"serifs\"
    on the bar were assymetrical, what I have in mind is the left serif being wider,
    I wonder if something like that will make the logo a little more animate.\r\nAlso
    you see how your R if you remove the leg it's basically a P, meaning the corner
    of the outside curve where it meets the Leg is lined with the bottom horizontal.
    Well try bringing that corner up, this will reduce the amount of ink in that area.\r\nBut
    honestly it looks good like this so..."

  body: "Good call on the R! That's a great refinement (for what is probably a common
    blunder). I also increased the thickness of the bottom of the E, ever so slightly
    to give it a more solid feeling base.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the asymmetrical
    T, though. I gave it a shot, but I don't know that it adds that much. Performing
    that little experiment did, however, lead me to realize that my original T was
    too narrow. I definitely prefer it wider.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrexLogo2_4805.jpg]"

    \r\n> I took this to mean that...\r\n\r\nYour guess about what they meant sounds
    reasonable, but just the same it might be wise to ask them to explain further
    exactly what they meant.  \r\n\r\nMany times I've tried to guess what a client
    meant by a vague comment, only to find out later that they meant something else.
    Sometimes this is because a client is so familiar with their company's product
    that they tend to talk in verbal shorthand and just assume everyone knows what
    they're talking about."

  body: I guess I could have phrased that better. It was agreed upon that the logo
    should be wide, rectangular and stretchable, but you have a good point. Non-graphics
    folks definitely struggle with articulating their ideas. Heck, graphics professionals
    struggle with it, too.

  body: Have you tried the X with one heavy and one light stroke?  That seems like
    it would continue the contrast you have in the other letters.

  body: "/X/ looks lighter than others anyways... And also doesn't share the same
    stylistic add-ons as other letters do with those <em>serif like terminals</em>.\r\n\r\nI
    also agree with Luma Vine that /X/ should have similar stroke contrast as other
    letters do...\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand I must say that I like letter /X/ the
    most because it seems the most original with wedge strokes. Maybe try a wedge
    stroke variation on other letters as well? It could turn out to be very nice and
    special."

  body: "Okay, so I've attempted to implement a few more suggestions here to see how
    they work.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I increased the contrast of the X in an attempt to
    keep the same overall design, but make in feel like it has similar thick/thin
    proportions to the rest of the font, without actually making one stroke lighter.
    It seems like it might be a tad to heavy now, but correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nNext,
    I tried incorporating the \"wedge\" idea further, but without radically changing
    the design. The R seems like a logical place.\r\n\r\nJust for kicks, I tried a
    design direction (that I had previously abandoned) and made the whole thing more
    \"wedgy.\" Granted, it's a far cry from a balanced bit of type, but I can already
    see that it's threatening to be a kitschy sci-fi font. I think there's a reason
    I didn't go down this road the first time I thought of it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I gave
    a true thick/thin X a try. I turned out better than I anticipated, but I'm still
    very taken with the other one.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrexLogo3_6336.jpg]"
