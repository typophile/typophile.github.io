body: "Dear Friends,\r\n\r\nI know this is the OS X forums, but I trust you with most
  things so I thought I'd ask about my most recent catastrophe.\r\n\r\nI won't go
  into the nasty details, but at this point in time I find myself unable to copy files
  from my second internal drive. I've tried Apple's Disk Utility and it won't perform
  the repair. I've tried starting up from DiskWarrior and it won't run either -- DW
  stops when it is on step 5 (directory). I'm going to go back to the office and try
  running Disk Utility from the TIger startup CD later. \r\n\r\nI was talking to a
  friend last night who said it is likely the main area -- don't recall what he called
  it -- has been damaged. He loaned me an external drive to try and copy to it.\r\n\r\nIf
  the drive ist kaputt, I am kaputt. Why are lessons learned only after you have to
  learn them? If I can get the files that is my worry. I will buy another drive if
  this one is beyond repair. All projects, fonts and itunes are on this drive. Boy.
  I'm scared. Suggestions?"

    but I would recommend you go to the Discussions section in Apple's support pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/index.jspa\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure which topic area would be most appropriate in your case, but I've had
    good luck there. It has replaced MacFixit as my resource of first resort when
    I have Mac troubles.\r\n\r\n(I had a drive completely fail last summer. Luckily,
    it was mostly used for sporadic backups, but it was a wake-up call for me. I now
    have an automatic system in place that backs up my most-used drives daily, archives
    weekly. Word to the wise.)"

    kaput drive data salvaged by an Apple tech.  There are other places besides Apple
    that do the same.  If you can remove your drive and bring/ship it to one of them

    be repaired.\r\nAn earlier version of Disk First Aid (which cannot repair volumes

    I would share a relevant personal story. My PowerBook 12\" died a few months ago
    while still under warranty, so I took it to the Apple Store. I couldn't get to
    the files on it, no matter what I tried, and neither Disk Utility nor Disk Warrior
    would allow me to start the computer.\r\n\r\nThe clever bloke at the Apple Store
    was able to mount my PB as a FireWire disk and through Terminal he was able to
    pull files off of the hard drive and copy them into the hard drive of the host
    computer.\r\n\r\nSo. When Disk Utility and Disk Warrior fails, go and find yourself
    who's handy in Terminal."

  body: We had a cat a long time ago that had a jones for computer cables. We just
    got a new cat recently (after my daughter pressured us for about two years). So
    far, he does not seem very interested in computer cables (unless you dangle them
    in front of him). I have mixed feelings about having a cat in the house. He can
    be fun to have around, but it's not unlike having a squirrel living in your house.
