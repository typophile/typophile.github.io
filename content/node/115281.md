  AnAkronism by Nick Curtis.\r\n\r\nThe FREE font you can download at Fonts 1001 or
  dafont but all those sites have a .ttf version which has been: \r\nConverted from
  e:\\nickfo~1\\ANA_____.TF1 by ALLTYPE\r\n\r\nI've looked at MyFonts, FontHaus, Fontsquirrel
  but it isn't for sale. Even the one on [[http://moorstation.org/TYPOASIS/designers/curtis/pages/a.htm|TYPOASIS]]
  has been converted.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a collection one can buy
  that this font (among others) could be found in .ttf? or Mac suitcase or postscript
  T1 would be a bonus.\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\nc\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    also produced a version for ITC as Zinzinnati http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/zinzinnati-itc/
    Presumably of better quality than an-akronism\r\nDon"

    was Ohio by the Schriftgu\xDF foundry, 1924. Nick states that he couldn't resist
    naming his version Zinzinatti and the swash variant AnAKRONism."

    Swash version is better realized but both are well done.

    to true type and vice versa - read mac to windows to mac, back in the day - so
    some freeware sites (or posters) must have converted fonts, thus the message in
    the font info fields. '

  body: "First digital fonts were ps/t1, the Adobe format. Microsoft went for ttf.
    When Microsoft became the main platform almost all fonts in t1 format were converted
    to ttf, some well but others badly, and many of the original t1 versions disappeared.
    Thus all these converted messages.\r\nBig problem with ps/t1 was the need for
    two files pfm & pfb. Ttf needed only one. With the arrival of the otf wrapper,
    those of us who prefer working with ps outlines can package them in otf.\r\nDon"
