  production?"

  body: "Frankly, I'd like to automate almost everything. Type design should be about
    expressing an idea regarding shapes, proportions and spacing graphical signs in
    a medium-specific way. It shouldn't be about spending hours and hours doing mostly
    repetitive production work.\r\n\r\nBut we're hampered not by tools but by digital
    font formats that were invented to ease translation of existing designs from previous
    technologies, rather than creation of new designs. Hence, we're still working
    with glyph architecture definition that is completely ignorant of what is being
    defined, i.e. there is no way to label the parts of a structure such that they
    can be independently manipulated across glyphs with shared features. The TrueType
    instruction set is as close as we've come to this, in that one is able to identify
    common stem weights and alignments through CVTs and adjust them, which is why
    I wish it were more of a paradigm for outline manipulation in tools. But that's
    only a move in the right direction: the long jump is to a glyph description language
    capable of expressing shapes at discrete levels of complexity, such that large
    glyph sets could be generated from small sets of modular elements and rules."

    using a method similar to how one hints TrueType for controlling features font
    wide. It is indeed an interesting idea.'

    process is hampered by accommodation to legacy, and the unfortunate belief that
    Postscript offers any real advantage other that more elegant outline rendering,"
