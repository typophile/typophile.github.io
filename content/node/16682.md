  vector rendering.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Britvic.gif]\r\nLooks like
  it started out life as Copperplate. It really is truly hideous. Most of the serifs
  don't match, the baseline is very variable and the V isn't even the same height
  on both sides.\r\n\r\nI hope the C is meant to look like a piece of fruit, I can't
  think of any other reason why it should be that shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
