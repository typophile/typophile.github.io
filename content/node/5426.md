body: im using fontographer and for some reason the metrics window is showing a destorted
  version of each character, they appear much thinner and generally weird. this has
  never happened before and doesnt effect the actual font when using it in another
  application. the problem is just making it hard to do spacing and kerning as im
  not getting a true representation of the characters. can anyone help?

    paths are going the right way &#40;for FOG&#41;.
