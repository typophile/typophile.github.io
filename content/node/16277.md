body: "I need a font for a booklet in which space is a rare good. So I am looking
  for a font with the following attributes:\r\n\r\n1) Well readable at 9pts\r\ni.e.
  comfortable for long-distance reading\r\n\r\n2) Condensed\r\n\r\n3) Typographic
  workhorse\r\nthe whole nine yards: medieval, tabular, smallcaps, ligatures, weights,
  etc.)\r\n\r\n4) Serif\r\n\r\nI know this asks much, but the project is like that.
  I'd be very grateful for your suggestions."

    you want Greek and Cyrillic also, as well as medieval.\r\nAnd why not go the whole
    hog with an Extended as well.\r\nShould be ready in 4 or 5 years.\r\nWhat's your
    budget?"

    with small caps roman, corresponding italics (no SC in the Italic) four figure
    styles, ligatures, ordinals. Good readability at nine point. Drop me a line and
    we can get you a sample pdf.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. I realise that it may be a bit too much to ask
    from a font, but then again - I wouldn't post here if there were easy answers.
    One should reach for the stars, shouldn't one? :-)\r\n\r\nCollis is very elegant
    and very expensive. I have Minion Pro, which I will probably use, but still find
    a bit 'common'.\r\n\r\n@nick: The project is non-commercial. It is part of a assignment
    for typography class at the art academy. So there is practically no budget at
    all. "

  body: "Yes, Collis is quite a gem. \r\n\r\nIf you can see yourself using it regularly,
    however, it might just be a good idea to shell out for it. If you can get it in
    OpenType, you'll basically have a font that will last for years. I know that Type
    1 fonts, for example, have been in general use since what, the early '80s? And
    they'll still be useful for a few more years."
