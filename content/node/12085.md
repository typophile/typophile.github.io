body: "I'm currently re-designing a fitness and workout section in a magazine and
  need some font ideas.\r\nWill probably be teamed with DIN as body and subheads.
  Can be vaguely retro inspired to compliment the modern cut of DIN or something just
  as modern but different enough.\r\nDon't really want anything to flimsy or serify
  (Slab serif is OK), but needs to give the feeling of working out and sporty.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"
