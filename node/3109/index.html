		<div class="commentbody"> Book Antiqua is an unauthorized knockoff of Palatino for which Herman Zapf receives zero royalties. Personally, I&#39;m baffled that Monotype is still selling the damn thing. I thought the whole Book Antiqua fiasco got settled and that as copmensation Monotype actually did the hinting for the new Palatino Linotype that comes with Win2000 and XP and is available from Linotype Library as well. I could be wrong about this though. <BR> <BR>Book Antiqua was done in the early 90s or so when Rene Kerfante or somesuch was in charge. It&#39;s possible the current management might have no knowledge that the package is still for sale on their website. Either way, if you&#39;re going to buy Palatino, buy the &#34;Linotype Palatino&#34; OpenType version for sale at fonts.de, or use the &#34;Palatino Linotype&#34; version that comes with Win2000 and XP. Not sure about why the names are flipped there. MacOS currently ships with an older TT version of Palatino that doesn&#39;t contain the extra glyphs or features you get in the OT version. The OT version can be used on both platforms. <BR> <BR>Also check out Aldus and Zapf Renaissance for variations on the Palatino theme. Aldus has lower x-height and longer extenders. Zapf Renaissance is a finer, more delicate font with strong allusions to Palatino. <BR> <BR>Aside from the Book Antiqua problem that somehow refuses to die, Monotype is a fine library with some of the world&#39;s best hinting. But please consider buying Linotype designs from Linotype. <BR> <BR>Note that unlike Book Antiqua which was not authorized, there are two Zapf-authorized Palatino lookalikes from Bitstream &#40;Zapf Calligraphic&#41; and URW &#40;Palladio&#41; which I believe were released before Adobe or Linotype started selling digital fonts. But I can see no reason to get either of these instead of the real thing. The prices are pretty much the same. </div>
