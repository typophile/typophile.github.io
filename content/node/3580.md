  body: The whole thing appears to be a custom job. The A and R are typical modifications,
    but rare &#40;non-existent, as far as I know&#41; in fonts with these proportions.
    There are extended sans serif fonts you could start from such as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blair-itc/medium/testdrive.html?s=flatron%a0lcd&amp;p=48"
