    is probably up your alley.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"cut\"?\r\n\r\nHere is
    a good thread on type for organic foods: http://www.typophile.com/node/17373"

      nice base, and could be cut up from there a bit, to add custom swashing, etc.
      if need be ...\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: I dunno...do you have any examples of typefaces that COULDN'T be swashed,
    if one were to use a little imagination (an ability which, I am told on good authority,
    I sadly lack)? Your follow-up isn't a whole lot more helpful that your original
    question...

      ...\r\n\r\nunderware's \"bello\" - it's well suited for this i think, but i
      was trying to discover some comparable type\r\n\r\ni also was interested in
      finding out what \"cheers\" ( for the TV show ) was set in - i believe i've
      seen it at fontshop ? but cannot remember the name"
