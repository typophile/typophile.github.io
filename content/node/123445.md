  I was overjoyed when \r\nI discovered that his wonderful Iowan Old Style was included
  in Yosemite \r\n\u2014 in a \u201C.ttc\u201D format, which I don\u2019t quite understand,
  but with small caps and \r\nold style figures, which were lacking from my old Bitstream
  PS version.\r\nUnfortunately, these features don\u2019t seem to work in InDesign:
  the glyphs are \r\nvisible in the \u2018Glyphs\u2019 window, but can\u2019t be used
  unless you double-click on \r\nthe ones you need to typeset\u2026 Does anyone know
  what all this is about?\r\nThank you very much."

  body: I looked at opentype features for Iowan after opening and the regular Roman
    appears to only have kerning features. Seravek on the other hand is full of opentype
    features. Iowan thus appears to not have had opentype features added to do what
    you seek.

    minutes.\r\n\r\nIowan Old Style is however a Bitstream font and <a href=\"https://www.fontshop.com/foundries/bitstream/eulas/bitstream-typefaces\">Bitstream's

    and that lists features. I provided no script to modify a font in any way. \r\n\r\nIn
    order to \"fix\" the fonts, you need no script at all. \r\n\r\nTo copy the GSUB
    tables, when the EULA allows it, you open the two fonts with FontForge, the one
    with the missing GSUB tables and the one from which to copy. In the font with
    the missing GSUB tables you select \"Element &gt; Font Info &gt; Lookups\" and
    then \"GSUB\" and you click \"Import\". You will then see the lookups from the
    other font. You select them and then click OK. That is it. \r\n\r\nThat assumes
    that the glyph names are the same in the two fonts, which I guess is good practice
    for a font designer if one font is the regular and the other is the bold or the
    black.\r\n\r\nWith a ttc font, you probably need to split before; Apple's <code>ftxsplitter</code>
    does that."

    I am far from my computer with the last version of the github  Fontforge but I

    glyphs (in fact I counted glyph names).\r\n\r\nThe python3 script https://gist.github.com/johnko/6442827
