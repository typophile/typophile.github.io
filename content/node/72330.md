    (http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html) which have not expired.

  body: Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) have been turning on native hinting in FreeType
    for ages, no news here. I myself is disabling it since the autohinter does actually
    better job, I prefer or my fonts look the same (the autohinter does a decent job)
    over having hinted and unhinted fonts look different, I go even further and disable
    the embedded bitmaps too.

  body: I don't think FreeType implements any of ClearType patents, they however had
    implementation of native hinting patented by apple but is deactivated by default,
    so that if you can license the patent from apple (or live in country where it
    does not apply), you can compile FreeType yourself and enable it. So what changes
    now is that it is enable by default, which hardly makes any practical difference
    for many distributions.

  body: I guess the David Berlow version of this is that FreeType, having fantasised
    Apple patents that would prevent them from implementing full hinting support in
    their renderer -- and having apparently fantasised being contacted by Apple's
    legal department about said fantasy patents -- have now fantasised the expiration
    of those patents. Fantastic!

    that one has a commercial rasteriser implementation that one is seeking to license
    to customers for money, and then these pesky open source folk come along with
    a free rasteriser. Now, presuming that one has paid a license fee to Apple to
    implement their patents in your commercial rasteriser -- whether one needed to
    or not --, one might see it as unfair competition for another rasteriser not to
    have paid Apple to license those patents.\r\n\r\nAccording to the allegation to
    which Si linked, Sampo and Bitstream are the \u2018scary patent-mongering user-haters\u2019.
    I suppose Sampo knows as much as anyone about TT patents, since he wrote them.
    Apple, for their part, have apparently been happily collecting patent license
    fees from anyone offering to pay them, even as they appear to have taken no legal
    action against those who didn't. All very messy."

    competition with FreeType for the embedded market.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone other than
    you use the term rasteriser in such a precise way that it is distinct from scaler?
    Apple seem to use the terms interchangeably, as do other people who show up in

    FreeType that it would need to license patents from Apple.\r\n___\r\n\r\nI think

    I'm only tying to help. Them patented instructions, in post-aliased screen font
    environments, were not part of the solution of hints that worked... I said so
    long ago and since. I came back to cover your fantasies of my fantasies in this
    otherwise gentle conversation.  \r\n\r\nAnytime anyone wants to talk about all
    of raterization, (sizing, scaling and rasterizing) and use the term rasterizer,
    that's fine. Anytime anyone wants to talk 'bout one of them and use the term rasterizer,
    that's for less expert forums, I think. The patents, I think were for code that
    does scaling useful in aliased rasterization.\r\n\r\n>Since the business of licensing
    technologies for font rendering tends to involve whole solutions for embedded
    systems,\r\n\r\nI had not noticed this tendency from the Apple-MS TT license onward.\r\n\r\n>You
    didn't say you meant anything by competition. \r\n\r\nHmmm? I mean(t) that in
    the post-aliased world of screen fonts, FT solutions could bring competition to
    the Quartz and ClearType scaler and rasterizer solutions and bring true competition
    to many parts of the market vertically.\r\n\r\n>What Si meant is obvious: a different
    product competing for the same market of customers.\r\n\r\nThat, to me, is not
    obvious... Or are we so different, my brother, (the same market of customers),
    that we should be so devoted to totally different scalers and rasterizers? ;)\r\n\r\nOr
    would you suggest that the market of font software implementers gives their customers
    a choice? Or would you suggest that the choice these implementers have is wide
    enough to justify use of the terms like choice and competition?\r\n\r\nIt all,
    choice and competition, depend(ed) on developers getting amp-ed about hints that
    work if they need them, for the market transitioning from A to AA fonts. I see
    one 'r two companies that've been in the hinting business constantly since the
    mid-1990's. This miscreation of a fantasy problem with TT patents is one reason.\r\n\r\nAnd
    should I ask sii... who jumped off the hinting bandwagon recently? Head 'em up,
    move em out all day long here to ensure windows users don't barf at their type.
    Must be for the sake of competition, eh!?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
