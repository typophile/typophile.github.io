  headlines and it works well with the rest - but i'd like to see some similar fonts.
  it needs round edges/serifs and a bold weight. the art deco look is not essential
  to the design.\r\n\r\nthank you!"

    use it for this work, but more importantly, i''d need "cooper bold" or something
    - its too fat.'

  body: Thierry I'd recommend <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/windsor/">
    Windsor </a> as a stylish and contemporary (slightly earlier) alternative. It
    used to be a Stephenson Blake face, so now different cuts from different foundries.
    In the lighter weights, Cheltenham and Bookman would also be comparable.

  body: "thank you all for your help. \r\n\r\nin the end i now took souvenir - i liked
    windsor when i saw it on myfonts, but as the titles are all-caps, windsor seems
    too playful. sadly we dont have cooper bt (which would probably work better than
    souvenir) at school, so thats out, too. sauna is too playful and too modern i
    guess."
