    serifs.\r\nDon"

  body: "I had thought Times Roman. But a direct comparison of Starling Roman -- top
    sample -- and Times Roman[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StartlingRomanVsTimesRoman_5370.jpg]\r\nreveals
    that Starling Roman is a better match. Slightly wider lower case and easy to spot
    differences like the terminal on _r_.\r\nThe serifs are modified to Latin/triangular
    versions.\r\nDon"

  body: Reminds me of Mercury (Hoefler Frere Jones) due to the chiselled serifs. Don't
    think it's that though.

  body: "Mercury does have serifs that match those in the words _Never Modern_ but
    it is indeed a different font.\r\n\r\nComparing Starling to Times Roman I noted
    the following differences:\r\nSome letters, such as _a_ and _n_, are wider.\r\nLonger
    descenders.\r\nCove serifs with thinner ends.\r\nTerminal balls, such as _a_ and
    _r_, are heavier.\r\nTips, such as _e_, are thinner.\r\nVarious differences in
    stroke emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe two fonts are otherwise rather similar in proportions
    and are easy to compare because the ratio of lower case to upper case is almost
    identical.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
