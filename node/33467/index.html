<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm helping a friend with a photographic exhibition, laying up all the text for the wall of the gallery.
I have to set the type in Helvetica Neue. It will be black on a white wall.
Are there any special tips/tricks to this?
What would be the smallest point size?
Is applying the Vinyl tricky?
Any help would be greatly appreciated</div>

<div class=commentbody>Helvetica?! Ah, a photographer. Then it should be fine...

<div class=commentbody>What kind of vinyl are you using? Some are easier than others.... :-) You want to make sure your horizontal cuts are perfect, and if you get access to a laser level, it will be of great assistance.
I wouldn't set anything smaller than 12/16 (unless it's some sort of reference number of a picture from an outside source) and the top of the label no higher than a meter/40", otherwise you will alienate people with bifocals.</div>

<div class=commentbody>On a general level 10mm cap height is advised as the minimum, mainly because weeding it can be a ’mare, also vinyl cutting machines are rarely 100% accurate (±15% in some cases).

<div class=commentbody>Hey! Here is something I actually know about.
Unfortunately much of it has been said aready.
let's see... where to start...
OK, I assume you'll be applying these to interior walls. Make sure the paint on the walls has dried thoroughly and that the surface is grease free.
As for text, anything smaller than 18pt I really wouldn't recommend, but consider the typical viewing distance and adjust accordingly. Sometimes you have to go smaller.
When weeding text that is less than a half inch high:
first only pull out the counters from the letters,
then make cuts through the vinyl, but not the release liner, between the lines of text.
Apply transfer tape over the text block, including the remaining waste vinyl (being careful to apply smoothly with no bubbles or wrinkles) and remove the release liner.
Lay the transfer tape with the vinyl letters on your table, adhesive side up.
Now, carefully remove the waste vinyl line by line.
Replace the release liner on the exposed adhesive until reeady to mount.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If the letters are cut on a vinyl cutting machine from a sign shop no problems. You can do the layout in vector format and they will cut it exactly like you laid it out.
They can pretty well cut any size but what is more important what is a good readable size from a given distance.
Have the sign shop "weed out" the background and apply a large sheet of premask.
This premask can hold all the lines or block of copy together so you can apply it all at once.
Ask the sign shop for help and they will teach you the tricks on how to apply it.
Good luck
Gerry

<div class=commentbody>Of course, the easiest thing would be to hire the sign shop guys to come out and do the installation for you. </div>
