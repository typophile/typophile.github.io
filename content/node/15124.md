body: "Linotype Library released a beta version of their free font management tool,
  Font Explorer X. It was previewed at TypeCon in New York and is now available for
  testing for Mac OS X -- with a Windows version in development. \r\n\r\nYou can download
  it at http://www.fontexplorer.net/\r\n\r\nI tried it out this morning and I'm pretty
  impressed. It seems to be stable and fast. The user interface is not unlike iTunes
  or iPhoto, with some very cool features such as smart sets (dynamic searches in
  your libary). Just like iTunes, it includes an integration with Linotype's web store,
  for fonts of course. But even if you don't buy fonts from Linotype, you can use
  FontExplorer X to manage your fonts, and it's free (and the final release version
  will also be). \r\n\r\nGood work Linotype! \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
