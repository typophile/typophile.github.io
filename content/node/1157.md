body: This is a logo I&#39;ve been working on for a client who is opening a small,
  indepentent neighborhood bakery. Fresh handcrafted artisan baked goods will be the
  focus, but the bakery will also offer a small coffeeshop, limited delicatessen and
  bistro-style and sidewalk dining. <BR> <BR>The bakery will be located in the Avenues
  neighborhood of Salt Lake City, hence the name. <BR> <BR>After a few false starts
  on an image concept, this is the image and type treatment that the client liked.
  <BR> <BR>The colors are based on &#40;and meant to be evocative of&#41; the characteristics
  of baked bread, and the overall feeling we&#39;ve been trying to create is a simple,
  rustic, artisan-style charm. <BR> <BR>There will also be a horizontal banner version,
  with the mark set to the left and the type in two lines next to it. <BR> <BR>Comments
  appreciated! <BR> <BR>David <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15436.gif"

    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right about the awkward space in the &#34;Av&#34; combination.
    I&#39;ll try redrawing the &#34;A&#34; to compensate. <BR> <BR>Any other thoughts?
    I&#39;ll be out of town until Monday, but I&#39;ll check back then for more ideas
    and to post a reworked version. <BR> <BR>David <BR>

    BORDER=0> About the logo. I&#39;ve always like the idea of the illustration creating
    the shape, when possible, without having to use a shape. Does that make sense.
    As you have used the idea of something old and craftsmanlike, perhaps you could
    imbue the illustration with more a sense of history?? And perhaps instead of all
    italic incorporate some roman or a friendly sans??

  body: I don&#39;t think you need the gradiant. Maybe try a solid brown or split
    it into two fields &#40;wall/floor?&#41;. The gradient just seems way to modern
    of a technique for the style you are going after. <BR> <BR>The italics just doesn&#39;t
    work on a curve. I agree with what Tiffany says...maybe try some other type forms.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a nice illustration. You may want to beef up a few of the negative
    lines if you go with a smaller version of it.

    type are better for work on curves. <BR> <BR>Other question. <BR>How match this

    I don&#39;t know the client, or what they have in mind for the decor... <BR> <BR>Type:
    I agree the italics on the circle isn&#39;t working. Try open capitals &#40;?&#41;,

    to me. Too computerized for an artisan outfit. I&#39;m looking for an engraving,
    or a woodblock print, or scratchboard... not vectorville. <BR> <BR>There was a
    gelato shop logo that got posted a few months back that I think was suffering
    from the same sort of trouble. I know Louise Fili was mentioned elswhere recently,
    but check out that site for some gourmet/food/restaurant delectable type. <a href="http://www.louisefili.com"
    target="_blank">www.louisefili.com</a> <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s modeled after an
    old streetsign &#40;I&#39;ve got some photos if you want&#41;. Maybe it&#39;s
    not old at all, it&#39;s just where my mind goes first. All that to say, I&#39;ve
    seen your postings at typophile and have been impressed. This isn&#39;t it, but
    you&#39;re surely capable. Sneek away from your machine, and go for it &#40;fresh
    bread on hand might not help!&#41; <BR> <BR>Good luck, <BR>Randy'

  body: 'After a week of design classes, I believe I&#39;m qualified to shoot my mouth
    off, so here goes: <BR> <BR>Something&#39;s not quite working with the type. I
    think it&#39;s the ascenders and descenders - you have to leave a lot of space
    for them, so everything floats instead of feeling integrated. <BR> <BR>As for
    the illustration, Randy said it - it needs a warmer handmade feel. I&#39;d also
    add that you should get to the essentials, cropping it fairly tight around the
    hands and the loaf. To me the focus of the image should be the bread, not so much
    the artisan. <BR> <BR>I also think the dark brown should be pulled back. As it
    stands it looks almost black. Despite sounding cliche, I think the pallette should
    be muted and more in the grain/crust color range. <BR> <BR>Okay, I&#39;ll stop
    now.'

  body: That was the other idea I had - hands kneading dough, or something suggestive

    mixers - they&#39;re still handcrafted in a way mass-produced bread isn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;flat stick&#34; used to slide loaves in the oven is called a
