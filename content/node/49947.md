  am making a flash video about the history of Futura, complete with a discussion
  of the Bauhaus movement, a healthy dose of the font's integration of geometric forms,
  and its use in Nazi propaganda.  I have photos to fit my every need in the project,
  except for one: a pic of the Bauer type foundry where it was commissioned.  I have
  done extensive research on the internet, to no avail.  Does anyone here know where
  I could find one (or would be willing to post their pic)? Any help is much appreciated
  - AND I'll be willing to throw in an amazing, limited-time offer: a viewing of the
  finished video, online :P.\r\n\r\nThanks and cheerio\r\nbeatleblaker"

    That's a great punchline.\r\n\r\nFor permissions and possibly more information
    about Bauer than you may need, try contacting Wolfgang Hartmann at Neufville\r\nhttp://www.neufville.com\r\n"
