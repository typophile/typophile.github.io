  body: "If this is from a game it was probably made custom for the game. These are
    just symbols substituted for letters, right? The 'parchmenty' background, and
    quill-like glyphs is what made me think it was from a game. This sort of font
    falls under the same category as casual handwriting fonts described in our [[http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq|FAQ]].\r\n\r\n-
