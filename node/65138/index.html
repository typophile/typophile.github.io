  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was recently tasked with designing a manual for a Christian missions organization. With no style guide, no brand guidelines and no solid precedent, I had near-complete freedom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think of the layout, typeface-selection, and heck, even cover design. I&rsquo;ve never done a project this long and in-depth before (in terms of amount of information and page length), so I&rsquo;d love to hear how I can do better in the future.</p>
<p>I made a couple of decisions that were strange, and I look forward to allowing you to critique my reasoning in follow-up comments, but I hope to hear how it strikes you without first hearing my justifications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hair over 1 MB, so you can visit the .pdf in a browser at: <a href="http://drp.ly/2D08V">http://drp.ly/2D08V</a></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts, typophiles!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Is that ps. Ratio you are using? I just saw it, and it looks great. What concerns me is that both that one, and Klavika on the frontpage are very techy designs. (I’m currently considering both for a technology firm.) They’re not really something I’d use for an organization primarly concerned with humans. Also, mixing two sans serifs with a very different structure looks really messy. You should look for a serif and a sans with similar structure/skeleton, or perhaps just make better use of the different weights/widths in a single font family.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@frode and @riccard0, thanks so much for the feedback. It really means a lot that you&rsquo;d take time to give me feedback on this.</p>
<p>It is ps Ratio.</p>
<p>I wanted to go with a clean sans for this to convey simplicity, and I likely over-reacted to a certain extent against the tendency to make all non-profit materials feel &ldquo;rough&rdquo; or &ldquo;grungy.&rdquo; I loved the clean readability of both Klavika and ps Ratio.</p>
<p>Originally, I was going to go with Klavika for headers and Museo for body copy, but the Klavika felt too cold and the Museo felt too quirky. So in the end, I went with Ratio. I thought it conveyed a human, approachable quality with its heavy weights (specifically the downward serif on the upper end of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; and the low mean line on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;E&rdquo;)  I stayed with Klavika for the cover, as Ratio felt a little <em>too</em> quirky and unprofessional to be the face of the entire manual.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>What are some clean and professional, yet human, pairs you guys would suggest in lieu of the ones I chose?</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>As far as the dress code, I should clarify that this isn&rsquo;t for a church or for the right to show up on Sundays :) It&rsquo;s for high school students who will be visiting foreign countries (principally South America and Africa), so it&rsquo;s much more an issue of being extra careful to not violate their mores and offend them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some quick thoughts on the layout:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigational elements
What&rsquo;s really lacking for me are elements that assist the reader in quick referencing, as well as identify which section he/she is currently reading. I find myself getting lost quite easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look out for awkward breaks
Example: Pg 32: I&rsquo;d probably move the whole paragraph over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space for writing
Is there a reason why you have decided not to have writing space for reflections and/or personal notes? Is the manual is meant to be passed on or reused?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format: Digital or print?
If this is for digital distribution, that would answer my question about writing space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Folio
In print, the folio on the left page will end up pretty near the page gutter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just had to get this in the hands of the communication department, so it&rsquo;s out of my hands. I&rsquo;d love to keep the conversation up so I can get better for the future, though! Thanks again for all the help you&rsquo;ve been giving me so far. It&rsquo;s my first typesetting project, so I really need it.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Jabez,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to comment.</p>
<p>-Nav: My hope was that the bottom next to the page numbers would be enough assistance. Do you feel I just need more prominent placement of this, or additional navigation?</p>
<p>-Spaces: The idea is that they&rsquo;ll write in their own journal rather than in the book to encourage them to use more space.</p>
<p>-Breaks: Great call on this p. 32 break. I totally missed that.</p>
<p>-Format: print</p>
<p>-Folio: I&rsquo;m not sure I follow here. Each page will be printed independently, one-sided, no left-and-right setup. What do you mean by &ldquo;the folio on the left page?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Frode, great suggestion on Gloriola. Can&rsquo;t switch away from Ratio at this point, though. I&rsquo;ve marked the font to come back from it, it&rsquo;s really nice. I also updated the coloring and switched the cover font to Ratio as well. I think getting rid of Klavika certainly helps some.</p>
