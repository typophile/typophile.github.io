  body: "Hmm\u2026 I'd use a colon I think. And I might also substitute a comma for
    the semicolon after \"problems\". Or, any chance to turn that into a bulleted
    list?\r\n\r\nIf you stick with the ellipsis, wouldn't you need a space after it?\r\n\r\nBTW,
    wouldn't \"Who is coaching for?\" be considered somewhat bad English?"

  body: "I think title is good English...the style guides I've read say that 'For
    whom is coaching?' just sounds unnatural...is that what you meant? Maybe I could
    do 'Who can benefit from coaching?' and then take out the bit 'coaching works
    for people at all levels...'? \r\n\r\nI rather like semicolons for lists of long
    strings of text, they show more of a break than a comma would. I was thinking
    of bulleting it, but you can see the length of each item would be longer than
    a line and I don't have more space...always the same old problem with space!\r\n\r\nI
    think a colon might be the right answer. I don't know about space after an ellipsis
    and thought it looked unbalanced unless there was one in front too...I need a
    more comprehensive style guide!"

    say what you mean and prefer spoken language to wordy constructions.\r\n\r\nI

    train in the direction indicated', followed by an arrow. In my head I was correcting
    it: 'Emergency equipment this way'."

  body: "I'd go for a colon to introduce what is effectively a list, making it do
    the work that Fowler said it had made its own special function: 'that of delivering
    the goods that have been invoiced in the preceding words' (<em>Modern English
    Usage</em>, 2nd edn, rev. Gowers, p. 589). \r\n\r\nA list should either be separated
    into individual items either by semi-colons or by commas, never by both. Commas
    are used for most lists; semi-colons for lists in which one or more of the individual
    items already contain their own comma. As none of your items/examples contain
    their own commas, your list can be broken up with commas:\r\n\r\n<em>Coaching
    works for people at all levels: for senior executives and decision makers with
    complex problems, for operational managers who would like support as they work
    to balance conflicting priorities, and for individual staff members as they put
    into practice new learning designed to help them work  more productively with
    others.</em>\r\n\r\nAn ellipsis, which conventionally represents omitted material,
    a trailing off, or a pause intended to produce or recreate a  'dramatic, rhetorical,
    or ironic effect' (<em>Oxford Guide to Style</em>, p 129), isn't - I think - correct,
    and creates an arch and confusing effect in such straightforward, technical prose."

  body: "Thanks for the definitive answer :) I like it.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to
    think the ellipsis was completely incorrect and I'm glad Oxford agrees!\r\n\r\nI
    tend to use semicolons to separate items in lists of wordy phrases where a comma
    would separate lists of words. I find it avoids the confusion of thinking the
    commas might belong inside the item. I don't think I'm following any style guide
    by doing that so perhaps I should stop. I do like semicolons on the whole! :)\r\n\r\nIn
    this particular list, the repetition of 'for' emphasises where how the items connect
    distinctly. \r\n\r\nThanks :)"

  body: "I have a tendency to do the same thing with wordy lists (i.e. separating
    them with semi-colons whether or not they contain internal commas), but I'm always
    more-or-less certain I shouldn't be doing it, so I was grateful for a reason to
    pull out the various style guides on the shelf to find out why.\r\n\r\nThe old
    <em>Hart's Rules</em> is where I usually run for a pithy rule about where and
    how to use punctuation, but it isn't very helpful on the matter of lists and the
    use of colons and semi-colons in and around them.\r\n\r\nI was given pause for
    thought by the fact that my third example in my list of uses of an ellipsis contained
    a couple of commas. Whether or not I was right in sticking with commas to divide
    the overall list because the commas only occurred within a piece of quoted material,
    remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nI'm sure someone will correct me . . ."

    I realise that contradicts what you said about sticking to either commas or semicolons.
    \r\n\r\nI thought your description of the ellipsis was perfectly punctuated.\r\n\r\nI
    liked the way you also moved the prepositional phrase and adjective next to the
    verbs they describe."

  body: "^ you are right that a semicolon breaks clauses within a list where one or
    more clause contains a list that has commas. A colon is the right choice in the
    example, but somehow it always feels like having a flashing red and a stop sign
    at an intersection. Em dashes are great but really make a dramatic pause, and
    you usually need a set. In ad copy it is common to use non-sentence phrases without
    a subject and verb and treat them as a sentence. IMHO, parellelism and brevity
    are most related to comprehension. Sometimes the correct punctuation or usage,
    if not understood by the reader, causes more confusion. I still can\u2019t give
    up \u201Cmore than\u201D instead of over. Oh well."

  body: "I think you ended up at this conclusion anyway but I'm in favour of a colon
    at the beginning with the list items separated by semicolons. Putting a semicolon
    before the \"and ... \" is optional but might be helpful if your listed clauses
    are very long.\r\n\r\nMaybe the \"for\" at the beginning of each is unneccessary?\r\n\r\nCoaching

    operational managers who require support to balance conflicting priorities; and

    example the semicolons do the job of the 'for', whereas if commas are used the
    'for' shows where the listed items connect to the premise."
