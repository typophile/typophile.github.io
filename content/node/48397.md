body: "i was working on creating a logotype for 'school of applied communication'\r\nhaving
  tried a few dozens of typefaces i got fed up and decided to try and develop my own
  lettering for it.\r\n\r\nto cut the long story short, the client chosen a futura
  logotype over my design.\r\n\r\nhere's my rough logo done with a brush and indian
  ink. \r\ni haven't digitised it yet, but since its been rejected i probably won't.\r\n\r\nany
  feedback is welcome as this is my 1st jab at type design.\r\n"
