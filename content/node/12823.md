  border=\"0\" width=\"880\" alt=\"Image Hosted by ImageShack.us\" target=\"new\"
  />this</a> recently by a client who wants the same font on his project as Maxim
  uses in it's \"Circus Maximus\" page. When I couldn't find the exact same font I
  suggested very similar alternatives (CC Dave Gibbons, CC Wild Words, or Blambot's
  Jack Armstrong came to mind). He insists, however, on trying to get the exact same
  font if possible. \r\n\r\nI've even tried contacting Maxim directly but alas did
  not have my calls returned.  \r\n\r\nI was hoping some fresh eyes here could help
  out as maybe I missed the obvious. As always, any help is appreciated. \r\n\r\nHere
  again is the link to the image:\r\n<a href=http://img158.echo.cx/img158/8245/cmc31ae.jpg>

    where you will surely find something close. But, you could wait cause Yves is
    a comic-nut and he might know the exact match.

  body: "In my original message I mentioned CC Dave Gibbons and CC Wildwords which
    are from Comicraft and Blambot's Jack Armstrong. All of the above are very close
    to the font in question. I was hoping I missed something either at Comicraft,
    Blambot or perhaps another font I hadn't even thought of. Perhaps someone will
    still recognize this and point it out. Here's to hoping ...\r\n "
