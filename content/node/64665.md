body: "espn always has nice fonts. this font looks somewhat familiar but the chopped
  tops of the S's and G's as well as the slanted bar in the H make it distinguished.
  The \"R\" is also slanted some. i'm interested in seeing if there are varying weights
  to this font.\r\n\r\nthis is from the previous issue which was about college basketball.
  i tried getting a link to the digital version but its been updated to the most recent.\r\n\r\nany
  help much appreciated! i tried providing as much information as possible. thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/espnBballFont_4676.gif]"
