  on the NEWS page of my updated &#40;and now bilingual&#41; website: <a href="http://www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl"
  target="_blank">www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl</a>. Hope you enjoy &#40;I did!&#41; <BR>
  <BR>p.s. I&#39;d love to have a picture of myself in Prague, as I didn&#39;t take
  one myself. So if anyone has a picture with the Dutch guy in the &#34;typedesign
  is not a crime&#34; shirt with the red goatee, please let me know.'

  body: Diederik, the picture on the top row, sixth from the left &#40;4th from the
    right&#41; has a bad link. It is currently linked to <a href="http://www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl/040928-1413th.jpg"
    target="_blank">http://www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl/040928-1413th.jpg</a>, but it should
    be <a href="http://www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl/040928-1413.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.klaar-ontwerpen.nl/040928-1413.jpg</a>.

    <BR>But when it comes to beer, I think that is indeed where the Belgian trappist
    monks have an advantage.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp
