    Painter fonts by House Industries]] (Brush, Script or Slant)\r\n\"(PR?)\u20ACMIUM\":
    even if I can't be 100% positive it could be the same font, I was simply unable
    to find a match. I'm not even sure /\u20AC is original (done with a /C with 2
    additional horizontal strokes?). Don't even know either if it is originally rounded
    and/or roughened... You could also try to reconstruct the all thing starting from
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/|Univers]] (Ultra Condensed).
    Your best chance is, if you know the sample origin, to contact directly the designer
    in charge of this design. Anyway, some very loosely similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kcfonts/pewter/|Pewter]],
    [[http://www.ffonts.net/9.font|9]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/coldsmith/|Coldsmith]],
