    A better view of g would be useful\r\nSo here are some possibilities.Triumph is
    a British product in business since 1903. Perhaps a British font in 1966?\r\nThe
    letter forms available in 1966 suggest that this could perhaps be a sloped and
    edited variation of Coronation, Stevenson Blake c. 1937. [designer?]. But the
    M is not right.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coronation@20_5634.jpg]\r\nSomewhat
    similar were Corvinius, designed by Imre Reiner for Bauer 1929-34 which had lighter
    serif features on T and E. \r\nAlso somewhat similar is Eden, designed by R.H.Middleton
    in 1934. \r\nAs for the g Coronation or Corvinius might match, but not Eden\r\nI
    did not come across any digital versions of any of these fonts as an italic.\r\nDon\r\n"
