    narrow it down to two/three possibilities."

- body: "First of all, you might really regret using double x's in the company name.
    It's likely to cause all kinds of search engine problems, not to mention give
    people pause before visiting your website. Overcoming the x-rated connotation
    of \"xx\" isn't something I'd want to deal with as a new company.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, none of the logos stand out. Sorry, but they're all web 2.0 glassy cliches.
    Oh, and whatever you do - with the xx, don't use <a href=\"http://i1000.photobucket.com/albums/af123/europhreak/logo/www48hourslogocom2010-9-148-51e.png\">this
    one.</a> It evokes....ah....well, the manparts of a smurf."

  body: "@alaskan I think you are referring to 'xxx'. Double xx's in my opinion are
    common and don't care a pornographic overtone. initial things that come to mind
    are the beer, sexing in chromosomes, and the roman numeral 20. also there is a
    band i think, XX\r\n\r\nStick with the double x. just don't add anymore.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree, none of your options are very inspirational looking. They all feel
    super web \"cheap & chinsy\".\r\n\r\nI feel it's more due to the fact that they
    have that plastic 3D logotype design, using the apple 'glassy' appearance. It
    doesn't translate well to your logo, and gives a real 2000's web 2.0 cachet, which
    puts me off to all of the options. I see what you were trying to go for, but I
    just don't think you should push the company's image in that direction, I think
    they'd probably want something flatter and more defined. \r\n\r\nHope that helps-"

  body: "I think it is safe to say this is not resonating with us. :) But how many
    other ideas have you tried? These are all basically the same idea in slightly
    different arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"Mad\" and \"box\" give you quite a lot to work
    with. Why not give another couple ideas a go and post them here again! I for one
    would be interested to see what else you've got. \r\n\r\nI could get you started
    with the obvious idea of a red box, and he's maaaaddd... ;)\r\n\r\nYou could also
    try for something simpler, and perhaps a reference to what you do? Code has all
    kinds of cool conventions that make good typographical ideas."
