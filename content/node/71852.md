body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've just discovered a web design company in the Philippines
  has entirely copied my personal portfolio website and are using it as their own.
  I created mine a few months ago and a little while ago, I noticed a particular IP
  address in Manila had been downloading all the pages. \r\n\r\nThey've directly copied
  my code (even leaving in my analytics tracking code and my name in the image alt
  tags!) and used my graphics as well (icons, navigation, etc). They've also left
  in a photograph of my work in the slideshow on the front page. \r\n\r\nMy website
  is http://www.coullon.com and the one in question is http://www.wwmhosting.com/index.html\r\n\r\nAs
  I've never encountered this before, I was wondering if anyone knows anything I could
  do about it?  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nClaire\r\n\r\nEdit for screenshot: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wanbolsite_4038.jpg]"

    a new graphic stating something like \"this website was stolen from..\"\r\nName
    it the same as a few of your current images.\r\nUpload it to your images directory\r\nAs
    they are linking to your images they get a nice new one telling everyone that
    they have stolen your code.\r\n:-)"

    (Perhaps not so funny if you're the victim.)\r\n\r\nTell everybody you know these
    guys stole your design. Post it on your web site, in blogs, on Twitter. If you
    come across a discussion of site theft, hop in and say \"Yah, that happened with
    me too\". Don't forget to add all names you come across -- whois returns one Jojo
    Garcia <a href=\"mailto:bpgjr@yahoo.com\">bpgjr@yahoo.com</a> as their administrative
    contact.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this all? Well: if someone googles them by company
    name (or aforementioned Jojo Garcia), <em>your</em> comment on their 'competencies'
    will <em>also</em> come up. That ought to give possibly interested clients something
    to think about."

  body: Whatever other steps you take, the first thing you should do is document the
    plagiarism thoroughly. In addition to taking plenty of screenshots of the offending
    website, you should grab a copy of the entire site -- all html, css, image files
    etc. -- and burn it to a date-stamped CD.

    was stolen from\" image idea - unfortunately they simply uploaded everything to
    their webspace directly (even some of my text is still there!)\r\n\r\nThe links
    are really useful, the freelanceswitch one has some good steps to follow that
    I wouldn't have thought of. \r\n\r\nI've done what John suggested and burned a
    date-stamped CD and am writing up a cease & desist letter to see if that does
    anything. Of course, I've also followed Theunis' excellent suggestion which has
    already given Wanbol Web Media somewhat unflattering Google results. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again! \r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd encorage my site visitors to have a look at the copied site and invite
    them to shower the plagiarist with sarcastic praise. Then I'd tout my site as
    "the site so good that people feel compelled to rip it off". After the novelty
    wears off, send your c&d to take it down. Sending your c&d too soon is a waste
    of a good punching bag.

    plausible that I could take them to court)"

    saying they had no idea as they'd hired a freelancer in India to make it (obviously
    untrue as I noticed the same Manila IP address downloading pages over and over)
    and that they'd take the site down. \r\n\r\nI'll wait until the 10 days time limit
    I gave runs out and then contact the hosting company if it's still up (thanks
    very much Alex for finding all that out).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it's funny to
    see the [[http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=wanbol+web+media&aq=f&aqi&aql&oq&gs_rfai&cad=h|google

    website IP address is 174.132.225.245, which shows up as being under control of
    theplanet.com, which is a Texas-based company, which in turn is great news for
    you. All you need to do is send a free-form copyright violation notice to abuse@theplanet.com
    and they should be able to take care of taking the site down. This will not prevent
    Philippine clowns from moving the site elsewhere, but at least you can ensure
    they won't be hosting it in any civilized country. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you
    really want to press them, send a complaint to http://www.domainspricedright.com,
    which is the registrar of their domain name, and ask for the domain cancellation.\r\n"

    of design and CS students (often in India) who use it as filler content for their
    site design and CMS projects. Google somehow comes across them and because the
    content matches some popular site they temporarily jump up in the search rankings.
    After a little while they either drop to an irrelevant rank or the semester ends."
