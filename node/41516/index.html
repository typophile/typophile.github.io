  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, I was hoping I could get some new eyes on this logo. I think it is pretty close to being done, but any critiques would be very welcome.</p>
<p>A little background on the company:</p>
<ol>
<li>First off, I did not choose the name of the company. It still urks me.</li>
<li>The company specializes in ceilings of all sorts, but also does woodwork (such as carpentry, cabinetry, and other wood-related practices)</li>
<li>The guy has been doing this stuff since about 1970 and is very traditional in his approaches.</li>
</ol>
<p>I obviously tried to encompass these traits and really work to convey a traditional, old-style, blue-collar feel.</p>
<p>Again, please let me know what you think, be it general or specific.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for looking!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen this elsewhere&hellip;this appears to be a nice progression to this point. I agree, silly name, but you&rsquo;ve done well with what you have to work with.</p>
<p>It literally says &lsquo;ceilings&rsquo; but the look and feel certainly give a nice craftsmanship feel to acknowledge the greater service offerings.</p>
<p>Only major thing is that the &lsquo;S&rsquo; in ceilings appears optically larger, even though I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not. You might want to fudge the size of that a bit to bring it in balance.</p>

<p>Make the fatter stroke on the &lsquo;S&rsquo; narrower to optically match the rest. I think the &lsquo;C&rsquo; is probably OK.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re right Darrel, you have seen it before. A long, long time ago. I think it progressed really well though with some new direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at modifying the &lsquo;S&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it&rsquo;s great!  I see the &ldquo;S,&rdquo; too.  Since I&rsquo;ve been coming here for help, I&rsquo;d love to know how long it took you to do this and if you just tried it in Illustrator / Paint, etc. or if you drew it on paper first.  I love the ornamental touch to the lines.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This isn&rsquo;t a comment on the type&hellip; which as been addressed ad-nauseum. First off, this is a very elegant looking design, and would look fabulous as a wood etched sign. Two things jumped out at me.</p>
<p>First, the border is very nice, but it&rsquo;s also very heavy and compared to the weight of the text, seems almost too heavy. My eye is drawn to it almost immediately. This almost give the text inside a very trapped feeling to it.</p>
<p>Second, is more of a nit-picky issue. The rounded corners of the border, though keeping with the soft look of the inner stroke, seems too soft. I think sharp corners would play against the softness of your detail better.</p>
<p>Those are my opinions, either way, you have a nice design going for this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for the great critiques. It&rsquo;s really great to have such good, critical looks available. So that you all very much.</p>
<p>I am actually going to try sharper corners. I&rsquo;m not sure if I want them to be square, as part of the concept was that it was to look like it was an old-school wood routed sign, but maybe a little less rounded. Thanks!</p>
<p>Kristi, to answer your question: all told, this logo probably took about 10 hours of work, not including visual research and planning. And unfortunately, for this one, I did not start by sketching, although I went back to it a couple times. Part of my process is to get jobs, really dig into researching them -visual and otherwise- then let them simmer for a while. In this case what took so long was that the company name is very, very vague and hard to work with, so I got trapped into thinking that I could make it whatever I wanted, which was not the case. When I went back and thought about the founder, the work and what the company actually did I realized the name was just that: a name; and that the actual look and direction for the design was better predicated by those other factors, and not on the name itself.</p>
