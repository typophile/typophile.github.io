  design should stop by. \r\n\r\nAbEx NY: No, there's no graphic design in it per
  se. But those who are sufficiently perceptive will be struck by how many trends
  in graphic design in the last 60 years (and identity design in particular) started
  in abstract expressionism and percolated into the mainstream. \r\n\r\nOn Line: this
  is a drawing exhibition, or I should say \"drawing\", because the curators have
  included painting and sculpture in it. This too is a good resource for design fans,
  particularly the El Lissitzky / Malevich / Kurt Schwitters room, which is beautiful
  and amazing. These guys were obvious influences on the American abstract expressionists,
  so the two shows work well together. El Lissitzky, of course, was a typographer
  and designer too, so everything gets reconnected."
