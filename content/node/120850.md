body: I'm looking to find out what font is displayed here. I'm sure it has been customized
  to some extent, so if anyone can identify the base font, that would be much appreciated.
  Thank you for any help.

  body: "The source is a card design from the zazzle website. I thought it might be
    one of their fonts, but it is actually an image provided by the designer. I've
    contacted the designer to ask, but have had no luck of a response yet.\r\n\r\nHere's
    the link:\r\nhttp://www.zazzle.com/calligraphy_script_wedding_thank_you_postcard-239200416167350437\r\n\r\nAnd
    thanks for the alternatives, I'll definitely give those a look."

    kick out Carolyna\u2014maybe all the alternate glyphs confused it. Or, once again,
    MyFonts hasn't added that font to its visual search database yet. I've never found
    it to be too reliable...."
