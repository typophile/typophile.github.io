  of Applied Arts and\r\nDesign in Zurich, Switzerland. For our final project we would
  like to develop a randomized font similar to the local gothic\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com/Schwartzco/LocalGothic/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\ninstead
  of four fonts we'd like to include many more (about 10-15). \r\nWe will use the
  font mainly for print media which we design on our Mac OSX\r\nTiger in InDesign.
  We're not programming cracks, just users. That's why we really depend on someone
  who could help us to find a solution to our problem. We already contacted the programmer
  of the Local Gothic code but he doesn't seem to sell the script. Can anybody help
  us? \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/">ScanFont</a> would be you're
    best bet. Although I wouldn't merely print out 10-15 fonts and scan letters in.
    You'll need to draw some letters or hunt around town for some unique found type.

      our problem is not to draw the font, our problem is that we don't know, how
      to program a font, which choses it's letter randomly. that's the the idea of
      it. maybe i didn't explain it very well?\r\nwe want to create a font with many
      different font-possibilities for each letter. so if i put an \"R\" my font should
      chose one of them by a random-option."
