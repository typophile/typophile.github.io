body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nI just noticed something really annoying. Open any non-adobe
  application- like Text Edit or Pages. Type some text with numbers set in Didot regular.
  Highlight it. Press command-T for the font panel then open the typography panel.\r\n\r\nThe
  typography panel showns some options including OSF figures but when you click on
  the buttom to make that happpen- NOTHING!\r\n\r\nI thought maybe my Didot font became
  corrupt so I went to an Apple store to verify the OSF figures working, but then
  on these NEW machines they also did not work.\r\n\r\nI checked FontBook and the
  Special Character utilites. I see the OSF figures there but... they don't work or
  I'm not allowed to access them. \r\n\r\nI ask somebody at the help desk... the guys
  says that's probably an Apple corporate decision!!! \r\n\r\nVery Annoying indeed!
  Its like buying a car with a radio installed that does not play the AM band even
  though the hardware is there.\r\n\r\nI don't own any Adobe apps... just curious
  can you guys access the OSF figures in InDesign?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMikey"

    figures via the Glyph palette only. I think there is something broken in the font.\r\n"

  body: "I suspect the Didot font (Didot.dfont) uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography\">AAT</a>
    tables and not OpenType tables, that's why OsF are not accessible in InDesign.\r\n\r\nBut
    I agree this doesn't explain why the font doesn't work correctly in TextEdit.
    It ought to.\r\nSmall caps work, so I'd say the font has a bug.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didot_macosx_4759.png]"
