  well together?\r\n\r\nFor example, I am designing a website for a medical consulting
  firm.  They already have a logo using Kuenstler 480 Bold.  So I am looking for another
  font to use for the headings and pictures of the site.  I want the font to be friendly
  and professional fitting a medical website.  I also would like it go work well with
  the logo which is very prominent.  How do you approach this?  Thank you. "

    using an ital. from one font and a reg. from another.\r\n\r\n2.) Match the historic
    period, or at least look for influences between.\r\n\r\n3.) Similarity of letter
    shapes, particularly common letters like the <cite>a</cite> and <cite>e</cite>,
    can create a sense of harmony.\r\n\r\n4.) Consider first the options designed
    by the same person."

  body: "Design texts make people way too paranoid about font matching. As long as
    the proportions aren\u2019t noticeably different for type being used on the same
    line, what really matters is that the fonts look good together. Using fonts that
    clash can be a fabulous way to build a hierarchy. I just did an organizational
    press kit that Pill Gothic for text and a mix of Pill Gothic Condensed and New
    Baskerville italics for headlines. The distinctiveness gets pretty wild in places,
    and it\u2019s all kinds of fun to work with."

  body: "Tomtype, I recommend sitting down for an hour or two at a time and mixing
    and matching faces. You'll learn what works and what doesn't, and out of that,
    you'll find matches that you can and will depend on for the rest of your career.
    Sure, you'll keep finding new ones, but you'll find the combinations that work
    particularly well, and they'll be part of your stable. \r\n\r\nI'd start with
    one typeface, like you have for this client, and just work with some that seem
    to go with it. Practice with the two of them to learn how the subtleties work
    together, then refine your choices based on what works best. You'll probably find
    two or three that work well with your \"control\" face.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course,
    when you see a good combo used elsewhere, find out what the faces are.   \r\n\r\nTo
    me, it's a lot of fun, but my wife doesn't like it so much as a theme for a date."

    someone could point me in the right direction if it isn't.\r\n\r\nI have to produce
    a Greek report where the required font is Frutiger LT 45 Light.  I understand
    there was a Frutiger LT Greek a few years ago.  Does anyone know where I can purchase
    this?\r\n\r\nIf not, can anyone recommend a Greek font that looks very similar
    and where I may purchase that?  Many thanks. "
