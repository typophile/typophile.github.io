    about the different ways to handle masters and instances on Superpolator vs Glyphs,
    and he showed me a quick preview of the Unica masters setup in Glyphs. They look
    really really good!"

  body: "I haven't done any direct comparisons myself yet, but from what I've seen
    of others the biggest difference is spacing, with the Lineto version being much
    tighter, hence more suitable for display use. Other differences: the Monotype
    version is more strictly monoline, and nicely covers Cyrillic and Greek.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is the same as in Scangraphic Body version."

    Spacing basically is the same in all these fonts.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/234_5428.jpg]\r\n[edit]
    It looks that it is not good idea to compare vector and bitmap pictures."

    Helvetica, one of the worst ones ever made, is still ridiculously prominent today.
    A well-crafted grot that could make a dent in that is most welcome.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
