  body: "'St. Georges': can't find a match, custom maybe? Closest I have are [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/novel+sans|Novel
    Sans]] and [[http://www.exljbris.com/fontinsans.html|Fontin Sans]]; BTW, /g looks
    pretty out of scope regarding the rest of the lettering (thinner) so could really
    be a custom(ization);\r\n('WEYBRIDGE': [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/times|Times]])\r\nNote
    this logo is not the [[https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2222983317/St-Georges-logo_rgb.jpg|current
    version one]] and could be found as vector [[http://www.stgeorgesweybridge.com/uploads/publication/file/2/Review_Easter_2014.pdf|here]]
    (bottom of page 12) which I can positively identify as aforementioned Fontin Sans."

  body: "Thanks Ryuk, \r\n\r\nI know this not there new logo. I do have the Fontin
    Sans. \r\n\r\nBut someone, who has done the previous work for their design has
    messed up with there font face & all their embroideries and other design are of
    the old one, therefore I am looking at old and alphabet \"G\" is what making mess
    atm. \r\n\r\n"
