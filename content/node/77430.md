body: 'I''m going to typeset a manual on the traditional art of wood carving: about
  96 pages, format will be 6,6 x 9,4 inches (17x24 cm), and full of pictures. Would
  like some suggestions on specific (serif) typefaces that could work with the subject.
  Joanna is the first that came to mind, for Eric Gill''s relation to (stone) carving.'
