body: "The <a href=\"www.indiantypefoundry.com\">Indian Type Foundry</a> is pleased
  to announce two new font families: <a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/itf-devanagari\">ITF
  Devanagari</a>, a classic-styled Devanagari typeface, and <a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/kohinoor-gurmukhi\">Kohinoor
  Gurmukhi</a>, another addition to the Kohinoor super type family. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/itf-devanagari\">ITF
  Devanagari</a> is a Devanagari typeface in classical proportions with higher contrast
  between the thick and thin strokes which makes it suitable for setting books, magazines,
  and strict demands of the newspaper printing. It consists of five weights and it
  optimised for superb legibility and use at small sizes. Its higher contrast makes
  it ideal to match serif Latin typefaces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITF_Deva_Small_4664.png]\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/kohinoor-gurmukhi\">Kohinoor Gurmukhi</a>
  is a lower contrast typeface suitable for both body and display text. A highly functional
  typeface family that is easy to work with and inviting to read.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kohinoor_Gurmukhi_Small_4268.png]\r\n\r\nKohinoor
  super type family currently supports Latin, Devanagari, Tamil and Gurmukhi, over
  150 languages and 1.5 billion native speakers. The long term plan is to make Kohinoor
  support all official writing scripts of India. Kohinoor Gujarati is at the last
  stage of development and will be published soon. Kohinoor Bengali, Kohinoor Malayalam,
  and Kohinoor Kannada are scheduled for 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSatya Rajpurohit\r\n\r\n"
