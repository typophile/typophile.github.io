body: Here&#39;s one that got me curious... A friend sent me a scan of the cover of
  an old EPCOT Center Official Album. The font looks very much like Antique Olive,
  but it has some obvious quirks that distinguish it from the typical versions I&#39;ve
  seen. Does anyone know the origin of this particular version? Is it available in
  digital form? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67548.jpg"

  body: The spurless G is the only real similarity I see between this and Antique
    Olive. Any idea how old this sample is?

  body: The copyright on the cover is 1983. But you really don&#39;t see any further
    similarity? Certainly the G, but also the t and a few others, and the overall
    character. To me it looks like Antique Olive with the letter widths all mixed
    up. But it could certainly be something completely different. Maybe something
    else by Roger Excoffon? Either way I&#39;m curious to know.

  body: I think it looks more like a typeface called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/vellve/medium/"
    target="_blank">Vellve</a>, although it&#39;s got some obvious differences there
    too.  <BR> <BR>A quick skim through the Sans Font ID Guide didn&#39;t find anything
    too close to these shapes. <BR> <BR>The obvious suggestion with a Disney project
    is that it has probably been customized by their own artists.

  body: Thanks for the effort, Mike. So am I crazy for thinking this is somehow related
    to Antique Olive? Vellve seems farther off to my eyes. Of course you&#39;re correct
    to point out that there&#39;s always a possibility of customization with Disney
    designs. <BR> <BR>If you have a fast connection, <a href="http://mickeyavenue.com/fonts/images/epcot-Album-back-cover.jpg">here&#39;s

    target="_blank">FF Strada</a> but it&#39;s far from an exact match and was designed
    in 2002 &#40;nearly 20 years after your sample&#41;.

    source, no?
