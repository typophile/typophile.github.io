    touch of course.

  body: "This is probably way too obscure but I think would be a challenging battle:\r\nTake
    Georgia (or any font with an /f/ with a standard ball terminal) and redesign the
    top of f so that if a dotless i follows it can not be mistaken for /fi/. "

  body: "I like the ligature suggestion.\r\nAnother one could be, given some definite
    letters, choose a well known typeface which is tied with a particular style and
    make them in another style.\r\nExamples: Franklin Serif, Garamond Sans, Eurostile
    Slab, etc."

    expand the asterisk to at least five symbols.\r\n(see http://www.typophile.com/node/65861)"

  body: "In a given typeface (say, Times New Roman or Myriad), invent new forms of
    letters so that the letters presently more-or-less indistinguishable in upper-
    and lowecase (CSVXZ) have distinct case forms.\r\n (That came from [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33647]])"

    I'm not serious."
