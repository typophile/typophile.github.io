  to attend last year\u2019s TypeCon recognize the resources that exist here in the
  city. After missing Hal\u2019s class during TypeCon I am thrilled to be getting
  my hands inky and learning a few basic moves. These images were taken last night
  during our class. Thanks again Hal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_6493.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6_5246.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_4832.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_6260.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6577.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/10_5325.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_5362.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5299.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_4845.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9_3779.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_4187.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
