body: "Does anyone know of a typeface that has a Gotham-like 'S', an Avant Garde-like
  'R' (most important of all), and a Century Gothic-like 'M', all similar in their
  uppercases since I won't be using any lowercases.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/S-R-M_4882.gif]\r\nThe
  reason why I need a single typeface is because it will be typeset in many ways,
  all in live text, so no vector customization will be possible (it won't be a single
  logo customization in the end). \r\nIf this is the wrong forum section, give me
  a shout. I know you will anyway.\r\nThanks :D"

  body: Wow - in a 4am caffeine buzz I just came across <a href="http://www.linotype.com/89910/literaregular-font.html">Linotype
    Litera</a> and may have answered my own question. I'm still open to suggestions,
    though!
