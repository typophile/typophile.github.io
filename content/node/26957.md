  of many different typefaces, various sizes, vertical and horizontal baselines. or
  parodies of this -- maybe on a tshirt. It has an advertisement feel. It looks kind
  of 70&#39;s to me. It has faces like: like cooper, vag rounded, ag oldface, berliner
  grotesk.  <BR> <BR>any ideas where i can find an image of something like this? '
