  this image is? If so, where would I go about buying it?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would
  be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."

  body: "That's an antique typeface called Tuscan Ombree,  and several other names
    according to Mac McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces..\" book. Also known as Carnival.
    \"Originally Bruce's <em>Ornamented No. 847</em>. It originated about 1849.\"
    The font Jan found (above) is a closer reproduction of it than Adobe's Zebrawood,
    though they are both based on it. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
