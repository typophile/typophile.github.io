body: "Hi yall, recently I'm finishing this font at Fontlab 5, I decide to add OpenType
  Features such as stylistic alternates and some ligatures, then when I start doing
  the kerning stuff, I add some kerning classes, since this, I started to have this
  problem when I want to test (compile) the OT features, this is what I get:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Captura-de-pantalla-2011-11-20-a-las-13_5915.13.jpg]\r\n\r\n[FATAL]
  <Untitled> aborting because of errors:\r\nsyntax error at \",\"\r\n[/Users/Rodrigo/Library/Application
  Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone know
  how can i solve this problem? I notice that when I erase all the kerning classes,
  OTF works normally, but when I add just one KC, this error appears, don't know why
  either how to solve it. \r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: "This may sound dumb. but if the errors occurs at \",\", then the problem
    is probably a comma where it shouldn't be. Check to see if your Kerning Class
    contains a \",\" when it should contain \"comma\"\u2026"
