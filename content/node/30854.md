body: Hey, I'm building a website in GoLive and using the actions to make layers that
  hide and show when you click on a link. Everything seems to work fine on my Mac
  and my browser (Safari), but on every other computer I've tested it out on, the
  layers never show up. Any way of getting around this? How do layers work in Dreamweaver,
  do they usually work? I'm trying to do similar things http://www.koehorstintveld.nl
  is doing but much much simpler.

    layers, whether generated by DW or GL can lead to frustrating cross-browser display

    a mistake in the code. I used numbers rather than letters. When I substituted
    letters it worked. It might be a KISS problem
