  body: "I suspect that if you attempted four-color printing by printing on a spirit
    duplicator, a mimeograph, and two laser printers in turn, your colors wouldn't
    be in perfect register either.\r\n\r\nThis isn't an attempt at anaglyph stereoscopy."

  body: I love it. Reminds me of the pre-Photoshop days when I'd achieve a rubber-stamp
    look by running type through a photocopier multiple times, which would make it
    look worse and worse each generation.
