  far as I know you cannot copy italicized type from a Word doc and paste it into
  your InDesign layout, without having to reformat the italics. Anybody have any workarounds
  or tips. \r\n\r\nWould importing the text and remapping styles be the way to go?
  Sometimes I just need to bring in a paragraph or two, in which case the text import
  seems laborious. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    accept fake italics and small caps from Word. "

  body: "> That will retain most formatting\r\n\r\nI've done that sometimes if I'm
    cutting and pasting a lot, although a potential disadvantage is that the pasted
    text may have some formatting that you need to change (like if the point size
    doesn't match your InDesign text). Also your InDesign style sheets may get cluttered
    up with imported styles from the Word document.\r\n\r\nIn many cases I'd prefer
    just to paste without formatting and then apply InDesign paragraph or character
    styles. But it's just personal preference; whatever works best for you.\r\n"
