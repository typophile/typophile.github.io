  much about it unfortunately, it's a cafe in Brisbane, Australia. The people that

  sandwich! Tried the free font identification websites but they didn't seem to prove
  successful. Any help would be much appreciated, even a similar typeface would help!\r\n\r\nCheers,

    at all. Mark Simonson and Nick Curtis both hang out with specimen books from this
    era, and might have an idea. So far, I haven't found anything particularly close.
    It's an odd blend of serif, sans serif, and script. \r\n\r\nSeems like it could
    be a good project for a font, because vertical 'script' styles seem to always
    get a lot of attention.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Not that I thought it was particularly similar, but as an experiment I took
    Fluidum Bold and set the word Chelsea, then backslanted it 10 degrees. You can
    see how different the result is when you start with a script face, particularly
    considering the e, s and a. The cafe lettering is more like a backslanted italic
    that has been connected.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChelseaFluidum_4327.gif]"

  body: "I have a theory that this is not a font, but a custom reworking of Bodoni
    and Bodoni Italic, with connectors added.\r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\nI've been
    working in the same genre for years - Jeanne Moderno (this week's typophile featured
    font! http://www.mehallo.com/introducing_jeanne/ ) is sort of a similar approach;
    and about 10 years ago, my first attempts to 'straighten out a Bodoni Italic'
    were simply killing the oblique angle and seeing what happens. \r\n\r\nAnd it
    looked a lot like the Chelsea treatment, only messier.\r\n\r\nSome of the vertical
    strokes in Bodoni are not always consistent - which is why the h and the l in
    Chelsea are tilting slightly to the left. \r\n\r\nThen, in just de-obliquing,
    the rounded forms, such as the C, e and s really fall apart.\r\n\r\nThen there
    is the decision: do I keep the dot-based terminals or not (in my fonts, I chose
    not to - it made everything look ... dotty)\r\n\r\nSo here it looks like the designer
    chose to keep the roman Bodoni e and a - then work on adapting the dots to the
    roman C and s.\r\n\r\nAnd if you look closely, you can see they are a Roman C
    and s with the italic dots added (with sort of bumps where they connect).\r\n\r\nThe
    script strokes could have just been added later - and they seem too custom in
    this use to be part of a font that was drawn this way.\r\n\r\nSo this looks -
    to me - like a custom job.\r\n\r\nIf it is actually a font, I'd say the designer
    took an existing Bodoni, redrew parts and regenerated it. Which is a EULA violation.\r\n\r\nOne
    more:\r\n\r\nThere IS a straightened out Bodoni free font out there - I can't
    remember what it's called - that is similar to this, but it also has major problems
    in its rounded forms. Someone else may know what it is.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!
    \r\n\r\nI kind of like this look, personally would want to eat there some day.

    great replies, I certainly didn't expect anything like the sort of response I've
    gotten so far!\r\n\r\nAfter looking around at some fonts with bell terminals last
    night after I posted this I rediscovered Bodoni and started working with that.
    I'm not much of a typophile. \r\n\r\nI put Chelsea up on a grid once I'd fixed
    the perspective from the  photo and I didn't even notice the left tilt on the
    'h' and 'l'. Great find. :)\r\n\r\nThe food isn't to bad at all, I had a BLT on
    turkish bread with some lovely tomato relish!"

    it okay that the 'S' and the dot on the 'i' is taller than the 'l'? If not, how
    would you suggest fixing this up?\r\n\r\nShould the ball terminal be a similar
    size on the 'r' as to the dot on the 'i'? Should the dot exceed the width of the
    'i' for balance or sit square?"

  body: "Yes - and no. It's sort of designer's discretion. For the i, I would probably
    sit around for the longest time and move that dot up and down a bit, size it larger,
    then small then large again and again, moved right, then left then up then down
    until it just looked right.\r\n\r\nDrawing this stuff is both mechanical and not.
    The not part is based on trusting your eyes - and if something doesn't look right,
    it isn't right. (something I attribute to Albrecht Durer). \r\n\r\nMy eyes say
    the dot is too low to the i, but if moved up - it might be too high. You just
    have to futz with it until it works.\r\n\r\nMy eyes also say the t needs to be
    taller and the cross bar needs to stick out more on the right. And the l is a
    hair too wide, it is standing out too much compared to the i next to it.\r\n\r\nWith
    the S, there's a few ways to look at this: \r\n\r\nOne, you're working with two
    different alphabets here. What we call 'upper' and 'lowercase' - and when using
    them together, one should either get the upper to match the lower more or take
    an initial cap (drop cap) approach: where the S is actually larger than the rest
    - as a beginning point for the word. The latter is the direction you're going
    in.\r\n\r\nThe other is to reduce the cap height of the S and let it flow better
    with the letters. The ascender on the l would then be taller than the S.\r\n\r\nWant
    the ear on the g to match the r more. Look at some other lowercase g examples,
    there's some great ones out there. Bauer Bodoni comes to mind. :)\r\n\r\nYou're
    getting there - this one also takes into account white space, which is also very,
    very important. :)\r\n\r\nAnd ... last night I cooked this kale dish similar to
    a BLT. Your post made me hungry. :)"
