  to this -- as English uses a simpler set of characters than other European languages
  -- but written differences must exist in multiple directions across cultures and
  languages. So I was wondering what top traps type designers might fall into, through
  natural ignorance of other cultures and writing systems. Do non-Icelandic designers
  care enough to properly design and kern the &eth; for example? I admit that while
  I do care it's low on my list.\r\n\r\nSo, do any grievances with English (or other)
  speaking designers need to be aired, or are there any other things I should be aware
  of before I kern and wrap-up my current design?"

    we do care enough. If you include glyphs in a font, they should be given equal
    respect and attention as those of your native tongue. Think of the user. If they
    purchased a typeface seeing Icelandic glyphs were there, they assume they are
    usable for their language. Type design requires attention to detail and caring
    for other language characters is part of it.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nHere is a starting

    ;-)\r\n\r\nFor your question:\r\nI guess you have to accept that you can\u2019t
    separate typography from language. Let me explain. To my knowledge, a \u2018g\u2019
    followed by an \u2018f\u2019 is absolutely rare in English language.*) In German,
    though not very frequent, it\u2019s more common. A few words that come to my mind:
    wegfallen [to drop out], Bergfahrt [ascent], Tagfalter [butterfly], dingfest [fixated]
    \u2013 let alone names like Siegfried or Mangfall.\r\nThis, of course, is due
    to the orthographic convention of writing compound nouns in one word: Ringfinger.\r\n\r\nNow
    have a look at this. A simple term, in two languages, set in a common typeface
    \u2013 common both in England and Germany.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Baskerville_4083.png]\r\nWhile
    the \u2018train conductor\u2019 looks perfectly normal and unobtrusive (that\u2019s
    what typographers want to achieve, usually), the \u2018Zugf\xFChrer\u2019 has
    two major problems:\r\n1. \u2018g\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 collide, although kerning
    is on.\r\n2. It has a capital letter, which is/might be inappropriately fancy\r\n\r\nThe
    design of Baskerville isn\u2019t defective \u2013 it\u2019s just British. That
    is, it doesn\u2019t have to repress its descenders, because they\u2019ll hardly
    ever meet. And it may have swashy caps, because those are rare and <em>should</em>
    stand out.\r\n\r\nBaskerville (or Caslon) will look best with English text. And
    German will look better with typefaces made by designers who are aware of its
    peculiarities. Just compare to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/aldus_lt_std_italic_ot/?sample_text=ein%20Zugf\xFChrer&sample_size=48\">Aldus</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/stempel_schneidler_std_italic_ot/?sample_text=ein%20Zugf\xFChrer&sample_size=48\">Schneidler</a>

    Serif</a>. I\u2019m not saying that this is a black-and-white issue, nor that
    Non-Germans can\u2019t design fonts that will work in that language. It\u2019s
    just very rare that a typeface performs equally well in a lot of languages and
    looks nice at the same time.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html\">Peter
    Bi\u013Eak said</a>\r\n<cite>When I moved to The Netherlands, and start working
    with Dutch language I had to modify Eureka \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t work well
    with a Dutch text, I hadn\u2019t thought of some letter combinations, and the
    rhythm of the language.</cite>\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n\r\n*) Ha, I found one: [[Jeremy
    Tankard]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/kingfisher.htm\">Kin<strong>gf</strong>isher</a>!
    Guess what \u2013 though of British origin, its descenders don\u2019t clash. Now,
    why is that? ;-)"

    adjustments can be handled with kerning pairs (like the i diacritics bashing cap

    an alternate f to fit next to several glyphs with diacritics to avoid the hook

    immersed in designing type the more impressed and astonished at how intimately
    and wonderfully complex it is. Not only does each font of a particular type require
    the designer to maintain consistent and rigourous discipline across hundreds of
    discrete designs which are ultimately required to express a single vision, the
    process also requires a broad and nuanced understanding of language and culture

    Unlike cricket though it takes months rather than days to complete and, as I have

    for years, but my simple serif has proved the most challenging design undertaking
    I can remember -- and I'm far from finishing a single weight of the roman."

    don't know how much involvement Mardersteig had with Monotype's metal version
    of Dante. It certainly looked a little softer than the foundry version that was
    Mardersteig's work. And of course, he had no input on the PostScript version,
    which to me looks downright melted.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the problem with
    Monotype's italic z's, y's, and occasionally g's, is solved by cutting a few alternate
    glyphs -- a \"z\" that looks like the z's in other fonts, a \"y\" where the terminal
    doesn't bend back so much, and a \"gg\" ligature.\r\n\r\nMy older British friends
    told me that these alternate characters were available special order back in the
    metal era. I haven't seen them, but it doesn't take too much imagination to envision
    how they look, and I make them up as needed. You can see some of my Monotype Garamond
    alternates on p. 37 of Rich Hendel's <cite>On Book Design</cite>, but it's nothing
    very imaginative.\r\n\r\nAs for OpneType, until we can have a many-many substitution,
    ligatures are probably best. For example, you might want two regular \"z's\" with
    jazz, but you'd need to use two of the alternates with \"fuzzy\"- a regular z
    and a altered z & y would look odd.\r\n\r\nJust to stay on topic, f + igrave is
    the toughest test I know. Doesn't occur in English, but sure occurs in French. "
