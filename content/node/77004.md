  experienced. I'm pleased to find this forum, in hope I may learn a little.\r\n\r\nI
  have an hypothesis about word readability I have been developing, and putting into
  practice creating a variant of a standard typeface. I am almost done with that.
  But before I go into details and publish either the modified type or my assumptions,
  I'd like to empirically test them!\r\n<!--break-->\r\nDo you have any ideas how
  one would go about that? Any established methods?\r\n\r\nI figured I could put up
  a webpage that would flash words taken randomly from a dictionary file, rendered
  in either the original type or the variation, and then queries people to see if
  they can remember the words. See is if there is any significant difference... What
  do you think?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, with \"word readability\", I mean the ability
  to quickly recognize words, abbreviations, etc. (but not long sentences) written
  in the type, in a setting e.g. on the road, where time matters and conditions may
  not always be ideal. Not books or small type.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  comments!"

    is one thread from a year ago.]] Also if you look at the posts of typophilers
    Kevin Larson and Peter Enneson, most of their threads relate to readability. Also,

  body: "<em>...my own effort to maximize reading comfort..</em>\r\n\r\nBill, we all
    do that.\r\nIn fact, your approach to Caslon was very similar to mine re. Scotch
    Modern, a genre which you consider to have poor readability.\r\nI don't believe
    our approach was informed by scientific empiricism or scientific readability theory
    in any way (as opposed to long established theories of readability held by the
    typographic trade), it's just post-facto rationalization of what is quite simply
    a type revival done according to one's personal taste, facilitated and informed
    by the state of the art at a particular point in time -- that is to say, what
    is technically and economically feasible.\r\n\r\nDid you do empirical testing
    during font development?\r\nAFAIK, the only legit type designers who have are
    James Montalbano (Clearview) and Jason Smith (Mencap).\r\nHowever, I'm not sure
    how truly scientific Smith's work was, or whether it was more along the lines
    of focus group research.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI recently came across some interesting
    paragraphs in <em>The Shocking History of Advertising</em> (1952) by E.S. Turner,
    set in Times Roman BTW.\r\n\r\n\"The leading writer on psychology in advertising
    (which was taken rather more seriously in America) was Professor Walter Dill Scott,
    Director of the Psychological Laboratory at Northwestern University, Chicago.
    His book <em>The Psychology of Advertising</em> was issued in Britain in 1909.\r\n\r\n\"In
    the previous century psychology had been an abstract study, couched in intimidating
    jargon. In order that practical use might be made of its conclusions, 'psychological
    laboratories' like the one at Northwestern University had been set up, and those
    psychologists who could pass on their knowledge in simple terms had begun to address
    advertising clubs. Many of the truths they announced had been discovered, empirically,
    generations ago. It is open to argument whether the psychologist gave the advertiser
    new ideas, or whether he merely told the advertiser which of his ideas were good
    ones (which the advertiser probably knew already).\"\r\n\r\nNote that the author
    equates empiricism with general practice, rather than laboratory experiment!\r\n\r\nIn
    assessing the relevance of readability science, and attempts to use it to prescribe
    styles of typeface or typography, it should be borne in mind that similar attempts
    to influence behavior -- which is the true nature of the agenda -- \"better advertising
    through science\", have been going on for over 100 years, with extremely limited
    success. A little awareness of the cultural nature of the endeavor might perhaps
    give some pause to any belief that \"readability science\" is of any practical
    use at all in typography, or ever will be.\r\n\r\nConsider the sitability of chairs.\r\nThe
    sleepability of beds.\r\nThe driveability of cars.\r\nThe walkability of shoes.\r\nThe
    wearability of shirts.\r\nThe memorability of names.\r\nThe lookability of makeup.\r\nThe
    cookability of vegetables.\r\nThe drinkability of beverages.\r\n\"Readability\"
    is not a scientific term.\r\n"

  body: "I am on the trail of finding who first distinguished between readability
    and legibility, and I think it was a scientist, but I have yet to confirm that.
    \r\n\r\nIf we define legibility as the ability to distinguish one letter from
    another quickly in isolation, and readability as the ability to read whole words
    quickly, comfortably, and with good comprehension, I think the scientific validity
    of the distinction is shown by the first visual in the article I linked to, among
    other things. There a word with individually highly legible letters is very difficult
    to read. \r\n\r\nAs I explained in the article, the only experimental testing
    in developing the font was with my own eyes. I agree with you about the poor results
    of research so far, but I am not dismissive of the promise of future research
    efforts, as you are. Based on the success of scientific methods in other fields,
    I am optimistic that such research will eventually bear fruit. \r\n\r\nI don't
    see how our processes could have been identical, since we bring standards that
    are in a few points in conflict, and those differences show in the final results. "

  body: "As I said, it's a question of personal taste, which we share.\r\nThese faces
    are about the love of old letterpress, and trying to port that quality into the
    digital realm.\r\n\r\nHere I compare Scotch Modern with a typical digital rendering
    of the didone style.\r\nLike you, I have not simplified and cleaned up the glyph,
    but attempted to incorporate the trace of the letterpress process, with a rounded
    finish, not square cut. Also, I have kept the horizontal flow I saw in the original.
    And varied the width of hairlines/serifs.\r\n\r\nThe micro-detailing we have employed
    is a contemporary, practical method now, with pre-press and press gain being so
    small in the digital, high-res (offset lithography) workflow.\r\n\r\nAs \"independent\"
    designers, these face of ours are not typical, in the way that, say, Adobe fonts
    of these genres are geared towards a broad corporate market that company represents,
    or Font Bureau types of these genres target the periodical market. (Even though
    FB publishes your Caslon.)\r\n\r\nI would say these are the deciding factors in
    our common approach, not anything we've read about reading theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n

    decisions were not only a question of taste, but also of my being guided by my
    theories of readability, as partly explained in the article. There were developed
    by reading, reflection, discussion with others, looking at type, and drawing type
    and testing it. \r\n\r\nMy theories are not the same as yours, and so my process
    somewhat different as well. It's not only a matter of taste."

    been developing</em>\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat is your hypothesis?\r\n\r\nTaking
    a new study like the one Kevin mentioned and looking at it's reference section
    is a great way to start a literature review. An alternative strategy, if you or
    any of your colleagues have access to the Web of Science Citation Database is
    to find an old study of relatively high profile and create a citation map. This
    shows you every article that referenced it in the future. By using both methods
    you end up attacking the problem from two sides at once. One of the older studies
    I have come across:\r\n\r\nRoethlein, B. (1912). The relative legibility of different
    faces of printing types.<em> The American Journal of Psychology, 23(1)</em>l,
    1\u201334.\r\n\r\nAnd while many of his studies are confounded, Miles Tinker is
    also a good place to start as most of his writing is an easy read.\r\n\r\nSee
    also:\r\n\r\nGarvey, M., Pietrucha, T. & Meeker, D. (1997). Effects of font and
    capitalization on legibility of guide signs. <em>Research on Traffic Control Services:
    Transportation Research Record-series, 1605</em>, 73\u201379.\r\n\r\nZineddin,
    A., Garvey, R. & Pietrucha, M. (2003). Effects of practice on font legibility.
    Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 47th annual meeting.\r\n\r\nZineddin,
    A. (2002). The impact of familiarity and word-superiority effect on large format
    text applications. Unpublished dissertation. Pennsylvania State University.\r\n\r\nI
    believe Zineddin still works with the Federal Highway Administration in Washington
    DC, but it has been some time since we have spoken. He is very personable and
    was more than willing to share his work with me.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
