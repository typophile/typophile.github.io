body: I am looking for a script that would have been used in Germany (specifically
  the Hessen-Kassel region) in the last quarter of the 18th century.  As I understand
  it, this would have been some type of Fraktur with the long s and ligatures.  Perhaps
  someone here could point me in the right direction?

    be likely to find. I think that it is based on types from the Luther Foundry in
    Frankfurt/Main from the 18th century. Frankfurt/Main was a free imperial city-state
    between Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt, but their types probably traveled outside
    of town.\r\n\r\nMyFonts has two digital versions\u2026\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/luthersche-fraktur/\">Linotype\u2019s</a>
    (the Pro font should have the long s and some ligatures in it) and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/neue-luthersche-fraktur/\">Elsner
