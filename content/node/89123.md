body: "A friend needs to recreate this logo in a print ad and asked me to ID the type,
  but I can't pin it down. It came from a midwestern sign shop that is no longer in
  business and is unreachable. I'm guessing it was a free download from the internet.
  Any ideas? If we can even find something reasonably similar that would be terrific.
  Thanks.\r\n\r\nHad repeated trouble attaching the image so I'm trying this link.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cthulhulives.org/harrisboyzauto.jpg"
