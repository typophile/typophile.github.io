body: "We work with packaging for many countries and has to deal with many languages,
  many we don't read and with alphabets we don't recognize. To control this we use
  software to control that the unicode values are the same in input (text in Word
  documents) and output (pdf generated from QuarkXpress) We are now struggling with
  differences in input & output for accented characters in Vietnamese text. So I wonder
  if the accented characters in Word can be the input (the characters you type) and
  not the result (the accented character) \r\nOr is there an other explanation of
  the different unicode values for the same character? (the visual character is correct,
  this is verified by vietnamese)"

  body: "With Vietnamese, it occurred to me that even a simple copy paste with TextEdit
    in a .txt file on the Macintosh did not preserve the sequence of unicode characters.
    Both texts looked the same but were only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence\">Unicode
    equivalent</a>. For instance, the unicode character \r\n<PRE>\r\n  1EBF  LATIN
    SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND ACUTE\r\n</PRE>\r\nis equivalent to the three
    characters (its NFD decomposition)\r\n<PRE>\r\n  0065  LATIN SMALL LETTER E\r\n
    \ 0302  COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT\r\n  0301  COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT\r\n</PRE>\r\nTo
    compare two strings str1 and str2, you then need to compare their normalized forms.
    With Python, you can use the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/unicodedata.html\">unicodedata</a>
    library; with Java, there is the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/Normalizer.html\">Class
    Normalizer</a>.\r\n\r\nOn the Mac or on Linux, given two utf-8 encoded .txt files,
    you can simply normalize both line by line and then compare the normalized outputs
    with diff.\r\n"
