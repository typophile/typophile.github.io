  body: 'When this did the rounds this morning at work, I had to admit that I''d not
    printed an email since 2003. Switching to a more readable screen-tuned font (Verdana,
    Georgia or Calibri would be my picks) would be a better idea to reduce printing.
    Could also include a guilt-line on the mail "The University will kill a puppy
    every time you print out this mail" for good measure. '

  body: I wonder how many emails are actually being printed that switching a font
    will actually save them money. I agree with sii...it would make a lot more sense
    for them to use a good screen-readable font in order to cut down on printing all
    together (saving paper AND ink!). Seems to me that Century Gothic would be pretty
    painful to read on screen at small sizes.

  body: "\r\n>what you say means CT stands for ClearTrees?\r\n\r\nThat's hilarious.
    I don't think ClearType is anti-tree, just think that cross-platform Verdana or
    Georgia would be better choices than Calibri if the idea is to stop people hitting
    the \"print\" button.\r\n\r\nShould also mention that your  50% estimate is a
    little high. Some XP installations have CT on by default, and IE 7 forced on CT
    system-wide. So you're really looking at a subset of XP users who are using IE6,
    so that would be less than 20% of Web surfers*. Many of those are corporate users
    who aren\u2019t allowed to upgrade, not college kids. \r\n\r\n*http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/03/inside-the-excruciatingly-slow-death-of-internet-explorer-6/

    I was a corporate network admin, and people do not like change. Even if it means
    staying UGLY.\r\nThis is typography as applied science."

    says XP's over 58%. \r\n\r\nSo how do 38% of XP users get CT by default, IE7 does
    this automatically?\r\n\r\nThe point being, for tree-saving, one should not neglect
    <em>any</em> fifth of the market. We read when we build @fontfaced sites for Mr.
    Zeldman, and MIT that these users not only can't read too well, but they can write.

    I can prove, beyond any doubt that <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/riot-act/">this
    font</a> uses less ink than Century Gothic.
