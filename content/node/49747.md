  height\r\nbetween the upper and lower case of the Monotype \u2018Porson\u2019\r\nmakes
  it difficult to find an utterly pleasing latin companion\r\nfor this distinct cursive.\r\nAt
  long last I took a bunch of old books on my desk and\r\nmeasured up some ratios
  between the upper and lower case\r\nletters used in the course of time by the Oxford
  University\r\nPress. And it seems indeed that the upper case glyphs have\r\nincreased
  as follows:\r\n\r\n1882 (a metal type for hand composition)\r\nCap Height = 1,62
  units\r\nx-height = 1,00 units\r\n\r\n1955 (a metal type for machine composition)\r\nCap
  Height = 1,86\r\nx-height = 1,00\r\n\r\n1978 (a type for photosetting)\r\nCap Height
  = 1,91\r\nx-height = 1,00\r\n\r\n1993 (a digital type)\r\nCap Height = 1,91\r\nx-height
  = 1,00\r\n\r\n\r\n*   *   *\r\n\r\nI have been examinig thus if the existing uppercase
  of the\r\nMonotype \u2018Porson\u2019 could be successfully replaced by capitals\r\nloaned
  from an entirely another font. The \u2018Arno\u2019 for example\r\ncan be seen on
  the left column (and the ratio 1,62/1 was used):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Porson_4993.jpg]\r\nWhat
  say You?\r\n\r\nP. L."

  body: "I don't much like the match of Arno caps & Porson lowercase.\r\n\r\nBut you
    are right, the caps in Porson are too big for comfort in most text settings with
    the PostScript version. I resized (& therefore had to reweight) our version long
    ago. But that was a couple of sales of Monotype Corporation ago, & I had permission.
    I doubt you could get it today.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Font Society has an Open Source
    version of Porson Greek\r\n\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces19th.html\r\n\r\nIt
    isn't quite as good as the Monotype, but if you're going to fiddle, it IS open
    source & there wouldn't be any license issues.\r\n\r\nGFS has some other nice
    Greek fonts, look at Olga on the 20th century page.\r\n\r\nAnd I've always liked
    Wilson Greek, Matthew Carter's digitization of Alexander Wilson's fonts. Not sure
    it is available now, though."

  body: "Dear Charles,\r\n\r\nIt is true of course that \u2018Arno\u2019 and \u2018Porson\u2019
    do not match remarkably well,\r\nbut astonishingly well with such incompatible
    pedigrees.\r\nIn the \u2018Agamemnon\u2019 of Aeschylus, printed by John Clay
    at the Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press in 1910 the upright capital letters are used:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Porson_CUP_1910_3702.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Porson_CUP_1910_2_5602.jpg]\r\n\r\nMight
    I ask, how much You decided to diminish the cap-height of the digital\r\nversion?
    (My very own skills are not sufficient when it comes to altering any\r\nexisting
    designs and that is the reason for my searching.)\r\nMr. Carter granted me his
    kind permission to use \u2018Wilson\u2019 in my recent\r\n\u2018Compositor\u2019s
    Epilogue\u2019 to a fresh Classical Greek Textbook for Finnish\r\nreaders, it
    is a masterpiece, but I wonder if it could survive moderate point\r\nsizes occasionally
    required in the forthcoming Greek Grammar?\r\nOn the other hand \u2018Wilson\u2019
    might be a perfect companion to \u2018TEFF Lexicon\u2019...\r\n\r\nP. L."

  body: "Second things first:\r\n\r\nI think Wilson Greek works very well with Quadraat,
    see\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=YenwwRfce9YC&dq=%22household+and+city+organization+at+olynthus%22&pg=PP1&ots=8-a7kcE0K3&sig=eH-gO-JlkD9qF37WAruetaTkxU8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result\r\n\r\nPage
    306 shows Wilson run into the text at a note-size setting; page 1 shows a text-size
    setting.\r\n\r\nOf course, this from an American (European-American if we use
    the current politically correct practice of appending the continent of our ancestors),
    who doesn't see Greek in everyday life. Someone who reads Greek newspapers, magazines,
    books, etc. on a daily basis may have a different feeling.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nMy
    discomfort with the Arno caps & Porson lowercase doesn't stem from the fact that
    the caps are upright & lowercase is inclined. As I remember, that was also the
    case with the old metal Porson. It is more the weight & contrast of the Arno;
    the heavy strokes are not as heavy, and I believe the fine lines are not quite
    as fine. Too, the Arno is broader for it's height; too broad for Porson.\r\n\r\nThis
    isn't a matter of numbers, but of feel.\r\n\r\nYou asked how much I reduced the
    ratio of the caps in Porson -- \"about\" 1.7 times the x-height. Depends on where
    you measure. This is the ratio of the top of the cap Epsilon, at 605 units (1,000
    unit em) and the flat part of the serif on a lowercase nu, at 349 units. But the
    rounded part of the nu is 364, the same as a lowercase omicron.\r\n\r\nI didn't
    do the scaling by aiming for a particular raito. I scaled them according to what
    I thought I could get away with. It was also a non-linear scaling, and I re-worked
    the weighting of the caps (& some of the lowercase letters also, from my notes).\r\n\r\nThe
    GFS Porson has a cap height of 703 (Epsilon, as above), and the nu is 396 and
    404 (as above). That works out close to 1.75. The GFS Porson also has upright
    caps & inclined lowercase.\r\n\r\nIf you set a lot of Greek and are wedded to
    Porson, it may be worth your while to have the font redrawn to your taste. I peeked
    at your user information; it says \"graphic designer.\" I make my living mainly
    setting type, and can justify the cost of custom fonts, either by paying for a
    redrawing or doing the work myself. When I work over fonts, I get no return, since
    I do not sell type. So for me and you, custom fonts would just be another business
    decision. Well, that's the argument available to us -- I suspect it's really about
    good type, but our motives are private business."

  body: "Dear Charles,\r\n\r\nThank You for all the invaluable insight!\r\nActually
    I considered using \u2018FF Quadraat\u2019 with \u2018Porson\u2019, but rejected
    it\r\nbecause of its overelaborate \u2018\xA7\u2019. (There are no less than 168
    \xA7\xA7 in the\r\ngrammar.) It would be stimulating though to see the book recommended.\r\n\r\n*
    \  *   *\r\n\r\nBy the way I think the numbers and ratios are often much gentler
    tyrants\r\nthan the pure feelings...\r\n\r\n*   *   *\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the
    custom fonts are far out of my reach... And the current\r\ncommission is most
    probably my last opportunity to work with the Greek\r\nalphabet. (I am afraid
    that no more than a dozen books containing Greek\r\nsettings have been published
    in the whole Finnish printing history.)\r\n\r\n*   *   *\r\n\r\nFurthermore, do
    You happen to know if \u2018DTL Albertina Greek\u2019 supports\r\npolytonic Greek.
    (It is obvious that DTL does not answer to any inquiries.)\r\nThe \u2018DTL Albertina
    Polytonic\u2019 mentioned here might be, well, customized:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2533\r\n\r\nP.

    doubt it was customized.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nYou might get up with Yannis Haralambous.
    He knows far more about what is available in polytonic Greek than most of us.\r\n\r\nhttp://omega.enstb.org/yannis/\r\n\r\n&
    on the off chance that you rejected Quadraat only because of the section symbol,
    remember it would be easier to switch that character than all the uppercase Greek
    letters . . . "

    \u2018Albertina\r\nGreek\u2019\u2014the individual letters certainly bear some
    resemblance to\r\nMr. van Krimpen\u2019s \u2018Antigone\u2019, which does seem
    a virtue to me\r\n(I am well aware of the criticisms towards \u2018Antigone\u2019,

    am not very keen on Mr. Slimbach\u2019s Greek types. \u2018Arno\u2019 actually\r\nreminds
    me of Willy Wiegand\u2019s \u2018Homer\u2019 which was used in archaistic\r\neditions
    of Sappho (1921) and Homer (1923\u20131924) by the Bremer\r\nPresse. It is as
    if the types aforementioned were too conscious of\r\ntheir fine calligraphic ancestry...
    Having said that, I do notice that\r\nsomething similar could be said of the \u2018Antigone\u2019."
