  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'd like to guage the interest in some t-shirt designs, particularly those of my daughter, age 3, posted on [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet|my web site]]. I'm trying to decide whether or not I should go through the hassle of setting up a paypal account so I can sell them to the general web public. I figure Typophiles would be the best market for these t-shirts.

If nothing else, you might be amused by Katrina's designs. These came unsolicited at the kitchen table. She drew them, and at first glance I was confused...when she told me what they were, I, her alphabet-loving dad, couldn't help but to smile with pride and glee.

:) I'd buy one if the t-shirt itself was a good cut and good cotton. I hate wearing big boxy square men's tees.</div>

That drawing and the type on it were done by my friends' 9-year-old kid. He's autistic. I, too, thought it was great, as did the guy who printed 24 of them for me, but so far I've sold about 4 at the [[http://www.viroquamainststation.com/|local public market]]. I think the problem is that the population of our town is 4,335. Once 4 people are seen with the shirt, nobody else wants it, regardless of how great it is!

> I’d buy one if the t-shirt itself was a good cut and good cotton.

Agreed. And here lies the problem with t-shirts. An average joe like me really cannot afford to print up an inventory of shirts to meet the demands of what has become a very particular market. So, sorry, there will be no excellent women's cuts until I sell at least twelve of the remaining Tired Mom "standard-cut" t-shirts. I do have some mediums and smalls in stock, 100% cotton...they look good on my wife. $15 and I'll cover the shipping. That goes for everyone and [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet|every shirt I've got]]. [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/|Contact me]] if you're interested. Thanks.
