body: "If you create an all-uppercase font, it's possible to assign <em>two</em> Unicode
  values to each glyph: one for the uppercase and one for the lowercase. In both cases
  the same glyph can be used. (It seems nothing in the specification prohibits assigning
  yet even more UC code points to the same glyph.)\r\n\r\nSome software doesn't appear
  to notice this: both Windows and Mac OSX show a 'full' character repertoire in their
  default preview field. OS X's Font Book only reveals the hidden truth when you select
  \"Full repertoire\"; Adobe InDesign, on the other hand, only shows capitals in its
  Glyphs panel (although typing in lowercase still works).\r\n\r\nAre there any significant
  advantages <em>for</em> re-using glyphs this way? File size is one. It also makes
  Opentype feature programming a bit easier, or so I imagine, as you don't have to
  worry about all combinations of F-I, F-i, f-I <em>and</em> f-i ligatures ... (Imagine
  a six-letter ligature).\r\n\r\nAre there known disadvantages? If you copy text out
  of a PDF, do you get the original uppercase/lowercase you entered, or is it All
  Uppercase by then?"

  body: "Riccard0 is right, and here's the thread about it:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/67092\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_3683.png]\r\nThe
    potential issue of retaining case in reconstituting texts from PDFs is the only
    concern I heard voiced, and I decided for a unicase display font that was an ignorable
    issue.\r\n(As I mentioned in that thread, I had all sorts of system trouble during
    development when I double-encoded the font and generated it with the same name
    as a previously-installed single-encoded version. But since my caches were cleared,
    it has worked like a charm.)"

  body: "Craig, thanks for being the guinea pig! That thread contained <em>exactly</em>
    everything I was cont'mplating.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it's Okay with doubling uppercase
    to lowercase for an all-caps font; your Unicase is indeed another style where
    the \"actual\" case of characters is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nSo, what about the Unicodes
    that get stored in a PDF? Hold on while I make a test file ... Result of copying
    text out of a PDF:\r\n\"THIS IS CAPS\r\nTHIS IS CAPS-lC\r\nTHIS IS All lC\"\r\n\r\nThat
    returns all as capitals <em>except</em> for that lowercase L. Hmm. Let me add
    a disclaimer then: I used OS X's Preview, which may not have been the best choice."

  body: "Much depends on how the PDF is created. If it is exported from a program
    such as InDesign then the original Unicode text strings should be written to the
    PDF. If it is distilled from a print stream, then Acrobat uses the glyph names
    to try to recreate the text strings. The latter situation is where having single
    glyphs named e.g. /A/ /B/ /C/ etc. representing both upper- and lowercase characters
    is problematic. Whether this is a problem for you or your users depends on whether
    they care about the case of the original text source.\r\n\r\nI recently made a
    monocase font in which we double-encoded for upper- and lowercase, but in this
    instance the recommendation to users is to always set all-caps text, and the lowercase
    encodings are only provided for compatibility purposes."

    such as InDesign then the original Unicode text strings should be written to the
    PDF. </cite>\r\n\r\nbecause that's exactly what I did. That's why I added the
    \"disclaimer\" about using Preview ;-) If I hover above my font in InDesign's
    Glyphs panel all capitals are identified as \"Uppercase\". It's expected as well,
    as the CFF part of my font only contains the uppercase, as lowercase is added
    with the Encoding trick.\r\n\r\n<cite>Whether this is a problem for you or your
    users depends on whether they care about the case of the original text source.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that's a problem. If one sees all-caps in a PDF, it's reasonable to
    expect that copying the text would also result in all-caps."
