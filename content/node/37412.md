    to me regarding this thread.\r\n\r\n<em>\r\nDear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI read your
    thread regarding Eric Gill, prompted I believe by my BBC documentary 'Looking
    for Mr Gill', with much interest. It was clear that most of the contributors to
    the debate, though passionate in their views, had not seen my film. This is simply
    to report that while the documentary has yet to get a TV airing in the States
    or Canada, the film is now available on DVD at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex-southdowns-guide.com/Looking-for-Mr-Gill.html\r\n\r\nI
    would be happy to hear from any of your contributors who wish to know more about
    the background to the film and my home village (not a town) of Ditchling, East
    Sussex.\r\n\r\nWith thanks,\r\n\r\nLuke\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting
    that the film was screened at last years ATYPI in Brighton and will be screened
    again at the upcoming BerlinTypo in May."

    \r\n\r\nI purchased a copy of the DVD at ATypI. Any typophiles passing through
    Seattle are welcome to drop by and watch it - just bring a six-pack of English
    ale - in honor of Mr Gill.  "
