  and transformation.\r\n\r\nWondered if anybody had any thoughts or examples of how
  this could be / has been done. Its not so much about flexibility, but more about
  progression, developing into something new...\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be most
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\n"

    the AIGA logo was redesigned, it was presented in a simple black-and-white poster
    that used Illustrator blends to interpolate the old and new logos into ten steps.
    Of course, that was when Illustrator blends were awesome new tech that blew people
    away, but it still looked great. "

    history of many centuries of type, who showed animated transformations of words
    in type, from one era to the next. Very cool.
