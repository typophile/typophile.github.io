body: I&#39;m sure this has been discussed, but my searches have turned up empty.
  <BR> <BR>Is there a way to change the properties of a font in Mac OS X? The reason
  I ask is that I&#39;ve just purchased a font that came with several different weight
  variations. When the font is opened in FontBook, though, each variation is displayed
  as it&#39;s own unique font family. <BR> <BR>Is there a way for me to change this?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.

  body: You can use FontLab to change the info in the font header - Family name, Style
    name, etc. In lieu of that, I believe you can open the AFM file in a text editor
    and change the info there. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m assuming that the Family name is something
    like &#39;Fontname-Regular&#39;. If you want them to not be their own unique entries,
    then the Family name should be just &#39;Fontname&#39; for each font, the Style
    name should be &#39;Regular&#39;, &amp; the Font name should be &#39;Fontname
    Regular&#39;. Same for the other members of the family &#40;e.g., italic, bold,
    bold italic&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you want a huge family &#40;i.e., more than 4 members&#41;
    to be contained in one family, you&#39;ll need to add OpenType names in FontLab.
    The family name for every font will be the same, and the Style names will all
    be different. <BR> <BR>Maybe this makes sense? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m at my
    most lucid today ;-&#41;

  body: Yeah that makes sense. That&#39;s exactly what I want to do. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    got four font styles in the family Paralucent. Each style has a family name that
    matches its unique style. For instance, Paralucent-Bold belongs to the family
    Paralucent-Bold. My goal is that it would belong to Paralucent. <BR> <BR>Is there
    another utility that can do this? Perhaps something without the $549 price tag?

  body: 'Yeah, it seems implausible to pay $549 to rename 3 fonts. I&#39;m not a Mac
    user, but I&#39;d try this. Open your AFM files in Simpletext. You&#39;ll see
    something like this at the top: <BR> <BR><blockquote>StartFontMetrics 2.0 <BR>FontName
    Paralucent-Italic <BR>FullName Paralucent Italic <BR>FamilyName Paralucent-Italic
    <BR>Weight Regular</blockquote> <BR>Change that info to this: <BR> <BR><blockquote>StartFontMetrics
    2.0 <BR>FontName Paralucent-Italic <BR>FullName Paralucent Italic <BR>FamilyName
    Paralucent <BR>Weight Regular</blockquote> <BR>Notice the change in FamilyName.
    Maybe that&#39;ll sort you out. <BR> <BR>Be sure you&#39;re not violating your
    EULA by modifying the information though.'

  body: Incidentally, if you have access to a PC, you can use CrossFont for this sort
    of thing. E.g., generate an AFM from the Type 1 font. Modify the info in the AFM.
    Then generate a new PFM file. That doesn&#39;t help you much though :-/

  body: As far as I know, changing the AFM file won&#39;t do diddly to help you. Mac
    OS doesn&#39;t care about or use the AFM. <BR> <BR>Is it a Type 1 font? <BR> <BR>In
    any case, you would need to consult the license agreement to see if you are allowed
    to modify it. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I&#39;ve got an email into T.26 about it. I&#39;ll post their response when
    I get it. <BR> <BR>I did try that work-around with the AFM file, just to check
    it out... Just as you said, Thomas. OS X didn&#39;t care one bit. <BR> <BR>By
    the way, I can still &#42;use&#42; the fonts, I just don&#39;t like the way they&#39;re
    displayed or organized.

  body: Mac files have two &#39;forks&#39;. A resource and a data fork IIRC. All of
    the font info resides in the resource fork, which a PC doesn&#39;t read &#40;PC
    files have only one &#39;fork&#39;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I have to jump back &amp; forth
    between platforms sometimes, and on my PC I use a piece of software called TransMac.
    It&#39;ll take a Mac file &amp; write a file that a PC understands. Pretty cheap
    to license, too.

  body: Sean, you can download a trial version of TransMac <a href="http://www.asy.com/sharetm.htm"
    target="_blank"> here</a>. The trial version is pretty functional, and the license
    for a full version is $64. The same company also sells CrossFont which converts
    Mac fonts into PC fonts and vice versa. I&#39;ve licensed that too, as it&#39;s
    very useful for non-OpenType fonts.

  body: "Hiyas-\r\n\r\nI'm brand spankin new to typography and am working with Fontographer
    4.1 on a PC. I'm pretty much Gumping my way through the learning process and have
    managed to create new fonts. However, they're all always titled \"UNTITLED\".\r\n\r\nI'd
    already gone in and edited the .AFM and .ini files, just like what's been mentioned
    above, however the .fog file that Fontographer uses to edit my fonts, doesn't
    seem to be communicating with the .AFM and .ini files. Essentially, when I attempt
    to Generate my font files, I've never given the option to actually _name_ my font
    or even create a new font family (goal #2).\r\n\r\nI realise i'm probably in the
    minority here with working on a pc and all, and i further realise there are newer
    versions of the software out there, but any pointing in the right direction would
    be most helpful.\r\n\r\nthanks muchly\r\n/aae"
