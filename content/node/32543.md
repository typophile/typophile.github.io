  available at (available at http://dayofsilence.org/img/top_right.jpg ).  I feel
  like I've seen that S, here, before, but can't seem to find the post.  It's close
  to Adigo-Bold Two ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/adigo/bold-two/ ), but
  the S and Y are wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndrew"
