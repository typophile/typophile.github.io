  music video</a>, which turns the lyrics into a series of nostalgic takeoffs on animated
  TV and film identities.

    but some of the ID's these were based on were done with very old school film techniques.
    The HBO logo that's reference was a physical object made of polished brass (see
    how the original was done <a href=\"http://drawn.ca/2008/03/08/making-hbos-model-city/\">here</a>).

    painters) welcomed or cursed the computer technology that made that kind of effect
    so much easier to produce.\r\n\r\nReminds me of the website that relays the story
    of the revolving contraption used by the BBC back in the day. I think that was
    also a link from Typophile, but I can't seem to locate it now."
