  assignment brief is around the idea of fakery.\r\nAnd my topic is based around the
  comparison between LetterMpress which is an iPad app (which I've purchased) vs.
  a real life letterpress.\r\nI've been a lurker on these forums for a while but thought
  I'd post here to see if anyone has used LetterMpress and/or a proper letterpress
  and see some opinions on the upsides and downsides to both.\r\nSo far I've found
  out the act of locking up using magnets and the pieces of wood doesn't actually
  matter on LetterMpress, it doesn't affect the outcome of the print.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a link to the video overview of the iPad app: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzMRPW9fwSE|youtube.com/watch?v=uzMRPW9fwSE]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply."

  body: I always thought the idea of LetterMpress was a little silly. There's a tactility
    and richness to the actual process of letterpress that simply does not translate
    in the iPad simulation.

  body: 'The upside of the iPad app is that it''s $5 and you don''t get ink all over
    your hands. The downside is that it''s not the real tactile analog craft that
    printing is and removes all the variances that come from working directly in the
    medium. '
