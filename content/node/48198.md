  body: "Hinting for low screen resolution will always be necessary. However, it seems
    that the process of finding out what to hint is moving towards the type <em>renderer</em>,
    rather than the <em>designer</em> (as seen in, for example, FreeType).\r\n\r\nI
    can think of various good reasons for this. A system-local hinting engine can
    consider local hardware issues such as resolution and pixel representation --
    up to the order of RGB pixels on an LCD screen. I seem to remember FreeType's
    hinting works on both horizontally and vertically aligned LCD RGB pixels, where
    ClearType is focused onto horizontal alignment only. There's no way all this (excluding!)
    hinting can be built into every font.\r\n\r\nAnother good reason is <em>consistency</em>:
    some fonts are very well hinted, others not at all. Using the type render engine
    to calculate hints means every font gets an equal chance to look good. (Or bad.)\r\n\r\nA
    final reason is, the two main hint types of TrueType and Type 1 are mutually exclusive.
    The designer has to pick one. FreeType can work directly with the 'raw curves'.\r\n\r\n(Note
    to everyone: this is all typed without resorting to manuals, web pages, and logn
    term memory storage. Feel free to argue.)"

    being done, but thanks to better rendering and autohinters there\u2019s (relatively)
    little need for the extensive manual hinting that was common in the recent past."

    FreeType).\r\n\r\nThat's where we want to be. \r\n\r\nIf you go back to 1989,
    everyone was still thinking in terms of basic type libraries of only a very few
    hundred fonts. Even so, the TT developers' claim they would have parity with the
    Adobe library in a year proved delusory, and let's not forget the whole thing
    came about because Adobe was charging exorbitant licensing fees. \r\n\r\nIn those
    days, when nobody thought of tens of thousands of fonts, it was tenable for Apple
    and MS to think of putting the hinting burden primarily on the font, rather than
    the rasterizer. But Adobe's philosophy, to put the burden on the rasterizer rather
    than the font, was always, one hoped, going to win out in the end -- otherwise
    independent type designers would go mad. It looks like TT is embracing this, thanks
    to better and better anti-aliasing. Nevertheless, even in ClearType, a tiny wrong
    instruction can wreak havoc, as shown by the error in Constantia revealed in a
    thread here some time ago. \r\n\r\nWhat it's looking like is that rasterizers
    are going to be doing a better and better job, but that hand-hinting will always
    offer opportunities for the best possible output -- unfortunately, of course,
    such hinting is always tied to a particular rasterizer. Could there ever be universal
    rasterizer? "
