  kinds can be combined in order to create layers of meaning. Type foundries usually
  suggest pairings for their own fonts, most notably Hoefler & Frere Jones and Font
  Bureau. I am looking to create an unusual mix of moods for a personal branding project:\r\n\r\n-
  Hearty, friendly\r\n- Weird, quirky\r\n- Contemplative, dramatic\r\n\r\nYou can
  think of this mix as the equivalent of a Wes Anderson, Sylvain Chomet, or even a
  Spike Jonze film. Sort of like what film critic Peter Rainer writes about Spike
  Jonze's film, Being John Malkovich:\r\n\u201CIt is hard to mix moods -- the film
  is manic, subtle, comic and vaguely sad -- but [Jonze] does it masterfully.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
  looked at a lot of high-quality typefaces, one of which is H&FJ's Sentinel. I think
  it has that (hearty, friendly) edge to it alright, but I am looking to mix it up
  with other typefaces in order to give it those other layers I want to incorporate.
  Check out my attached file to see a sample letterhead for Sentinel. I feel that
  Sentinel is a good text font, but I am open to other suggestions. Whatever your
  other options are, I also want your thoughts on how I can keep it all consistent
  on printed as well as web platforms."
