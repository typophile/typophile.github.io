  Out posters?\r\n\r\nI thought it was either Futura Black or Bold but I noticed the
  capital 'A' is different.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nHere's the sample: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-night-out_4313.png]"

  body: I remember an ID on this exact image awhile back but the search didn't work
    because the previous post didn't use a descriptive title.

    because the topic wasn't given a proper title.\r\n\r\nToo bad it was never really
    identified.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
