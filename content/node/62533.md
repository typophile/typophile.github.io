  would be appreciated as this is the style that we are looking for.\r\n\r\nAs the
  logo images are white over transparent PNG files (which may be difficult or impossible
  to see) I am linking to the actual location.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.shangri-la.com/]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.shangri-la.com/en/property/vancouver/shangrila]]\r\n\r\nIn
  my own research, the closest font that I have come across is Connach and Connach
  Historic.\r\n\r\nAny help, tips would be appreciated. Thank you!"
