  of some decent typefaces that suggest handmade letterpress typography.\r\nThis is
  for some Pro bono work for an old arts centre.  The client has suggested PRISON

  body: "Apply some custom scratches to Berthold's Clarendon cut or Super Grotesk.\r\n\r\nMost
    typefaces with scratches built in are pre Opentype which limits the possibile
    alternates. What you then end up with is the same scratches every time you use
    an character which looks crap.\r\n\r\nYou should have a look at some of Vince
    Frost's work like on the BIG Magazine covers. Amazing stuff. www.frostdesign.com.au\r\n\r\nThe
    best alternative is of course if you get a hold of some old woodtype on ebay and
    scan them and then vectorize. However I do not know if this is for display use
    or setting bodycopy?\r\n"

    in its rendering.
