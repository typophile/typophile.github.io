body: "This letter 'v' appears many times in an antique book I own (300 years old
  German). It represents 'v' for verse in a few bible references. I am not so curious
  about the font as the usage of such an odd letter 'v'.  Can anyone identify where
  it is usually used if not as an abbreviation for verse?  Thanks in anticipation,

  body: "This is one of dozens of Latin abbreviation characters. The typical meaning
    of the slashed v is indeed \u201Dverso\u201D or \u201Cversicle\u201D oder eben
    \xBBVers\xAB. May be occurring in other meanings though."

  body: "Thank you Andreas.  I was puzzled because the 'v' with the slash was altered
    in some other bible references to a straight-forward Fraktur 'v' - and I thought
    that perhaps it meant something different.  I guess the printer ran out of the
    slashed 'v's.\r\n\r\nThanks to others for taking the time to respond.  I will
    be back with some other queries.\r\n\r\nJohn"
