    to the temple for the humane purpose of releasing her from the influence of her
    mother, the Queen of the Night. The queen induces the young Prince Tamino to go
    in search of her daughter and free her from the power of Sarastro; Tamino accomplishes
    his end, but becomes the disciple of Sarastro, whose mildness and wisdom he has
    learned to admire. The prince and Pamina are united...\r\nAnd, a resturant:-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
