  then I read a bunch of subheadings which suggest that MS, Apple, SIL and Adobe have
  made their own \u201Cprivate\u201D deal upon that codepoint space. But it isn\u2019t
  that I wonder about. I wonder about why Fontlab submissively sub-labels that area
  and uses it for promotion.\r\n\r\nThere are other PUA encoding schemes established
  which have not less merits than the one apparently favoured by FL. I find this favouring
  offending and suggest that FL should *not* continue to feature this subheadings

  body: "That's best answered by Adam.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think you are lamenting about
    the wrong thing.\r\nThe issue is not that FL favors some PUA schemes over others.
    I assume that if FL would get hold of others they would include them too.\r\nThe
    issue is that the presence of special PUA schemes suggests they are kind of \"standards\"
    that type designers should address -- rather than discouraging use of PUA altogether."

  body: This is informational. If a major software developer has used PUA codepoints
    for some particular purpose -- most likely legacy -- then there is a risk that
    these codepoints might come with assumptions attached in that software, and it
    would be a good idea to avoid using these particular PUA codepoints. Alternatively,
    if you specifically want to make a font that is compatible with the use of PUA
    in particular software, then you want to know what this use is. And it would be
    perfectly possible for FL to expose multiple and conflicting uses of PUA codepoints
    in this way. All you are looking at is a labelling system.

  body: "John, do correct me if I'm wrong. If these areas in the PUA are 'taken',
    I can think of two possible problems.\r\n\r\n1st: if one puts a character into
    one of these areas and has to ascertain it's a certain glyph, that would make
    it part of the standard Unicode set -- not defined by unicode.org, but that doesn't
    <em>matter</em> because we have to adhere to stay 'compatible' anyway -- no matter
    who created the rule, you'd have to stick to it \"to stay compatible\".\r\n\r\n2nd:
    if these code points are assumed to contain a certain glyph, where would one find
    which glyph to put where? One would hope that it gets put into the new up-and-coming
    FL, added to the code page templates."

    one actually has a need to produce a font that is compatible with a particular
    company's use of PUA codepoints, it is best to avoid that relatively small set
    of codepoints, just in case some piece of software is making assumptions about
    those codepoints. That said, the nature of the PUA is explicitly such that neither
    software developers nor font developers should expect <em>any</em> degree of safety
    in making assumptions about the use of any PUA codepoint beyond their own internal
    use. The basic rules of the PUA apply as much to the \u2018Corporate Use Sub-Area\u2019
    codepoints as to any other PUA codepoints, so there is nothing to prevent another
    company or an individual using the same codepoints for other purposes or even
    claiming them as their own \u2018corporate use area\u2019.\r\n\r\nCorporate use
    of the PUA has occasionally been an issue for me in my work, but only because
    I'm making fonts for companies that have already made use of some PUA codepoints
    and I need to make sure that I use fresh ones that their software does not associate
    with other characters."

    usage of those code points and because they produce software used by millions
    of people, those areas have been \"reserved\" for them by FontLab.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    uses regular regions of the PUA for small caps, oldstyle figures, swash characters,
    etc., which have not been assigned specific Unicode points. While condoning to
    their lead isn't a standard practice, their labels in FontLab was likely due to
    convention rather than promotion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, those big companies developed
    the common font formats that we all use today \u2014 might as well give them first

    reason should anybody have to take care of that outdated occupation?! Rediculous.
    (except SIL staff, of course)\r\n\r\nSo the current FL practice remains sheer

  body: "I don't think there's any nefarious plot going on here - but then again,
    I am from SIL. I'm actually surprised to see this documentation of the SIL PUA
    ranges in FontLab. We didn't ask for it. It looks like Fontlab is only trying
    to serve their customers by gathering together info on the most common uses of
    the PUA. SIL's use of the PUA is [[http://scripts.sil.org/UnicodePUA|publicly
    documented]] and follows the guidance of the Unicode Consortium.\r\n\r\nLike John,
    we try by all means to avoid using the PUA. Most often it has been used as a practical
    temporary way to encode language data during the sometimes lengthy process of
    getting new characters accepted into Unicode. Around 80% of our PUA assignments
    are characters that have now been accepted into Unicode, and the use of them as
    PUA characters has now been deprecated (no longer recommended). Our detailed [[http://scripts.sil.org/PUA_deprecation|deprecation
    strategy]] is available, and explains why we keep characters at both new and old
    codepoints in our fonts. The other 20% are characters that Unicode rejected, ones
    that we have not yet proposed, or ones we ourselves have later deprecated.\r\n\r\nFontLab's
    acknowledgment of the most common PUA uses is not advertising. They are only trying
    to let font developers know about them so they can avoid those places if they
    have customers that already use MS, Adobe or SIL fonts - or use them in the same
    way. Note that since this is a <em>Private Use Area</em> you can feel free to
    use the range however you choose. Nothing bad will happen if you assign random
    chars to fall in the 'SIL PUA'. :-)\r\n"

    are presentation forms of letters plus diacritic marks that have standard Unicode
    encodings using combining mark sequences. While I understand that there have been
    difficulties in the past in reliably rendering combining mark sequences, these
    difficulties have very largely disappeared, and maintaining non-standard encodings
    for these diacritic letters is very bad text processing and interchange practice.
    All you need is one user receiving the text and either displaying it in a font
    with different PUA usage or being unable to display it at all, and the whole \u2018practice
    and agreement\u2019 falls apart. Standards exist for a reason, and as soon as

    For more details, see http://scripts.sil.org/PUACharsInMSSotware\r\n\r\nOther
