  body: It's rather difficult to tell from the snapshot you provided -- there's not
    really enough detail. A lot of the letterforms are similar to Caslon Antique,
    but there are a few oddballs in there -- M, W and a <em>lambda</em>-like character
    -- that don't quite match the standard Caslon Antique Latin letterforms.
