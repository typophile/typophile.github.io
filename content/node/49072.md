body: "We are refurbishing our control room and the ergonomist states that according
  to the standard, screens should be at 700mm distance with an onscreen font size
  of 3.7mm for dynamic text (text added by users) and 3.05mm for static text (labels).
  The screens will be at 1600 x 1200mm resolution. Does anyone know what size to specify
  the font (Tahoma say) in postscript points to make it 3.7mm and 3.05mm at resolution
  1600 x 1200mm or a method for determining it?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPetra"

  body: A missing bit of info is the DPI of the display, or failing that (and making
    the math more difficult) the screen display size (diagonal) in inches.

  body: Thanks Si. I don't know what the DPI is - perhaps I can find out later. Apparently,
    they're going to trial 30 inch screens (didn't even know they existed).

    the 1600 pixels of your screen in 'real world' mm. \r\n\r\nDivide the measured
    mm by 1600 to reach DPmm.\r\n\r\nThere are 72 points per inch, or 2.835 mm per

    I'm guessing, only in the US as we're one of the last holdouts avoiding the metric
    system (stay with us Burma and Liberia!) ;o)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for your help. As we don't know exactly what the specifications are
    at the moment we cannot specify a font size.
