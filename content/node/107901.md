  would appreciate if someone could help me solving, which types of fonds which have
  been used. I know that the bottom letters are hard to ID, so if it is not possible
  to ID those, it's perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spank_4163.jpg]"

  body: "\"Chase and Sanborn\" = [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/extra-bold/|Futura
    Extra Bold]]\r\n\r\n\"If your husband ever finds out\" - definitely in the Futura
    style. The oval-shaped tittle makes this look like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/spartan-classified/|Spartan]],
    however other elements don't match. The /s/ is more of a Grotesk style, and then
    there is the tail on the /u/. There were unfortunately tens, possibly hundreds
    of Futura lookalikes in circulation about this time, many of which have never
    made it to digital form. Perhaps someone with some older type specimen books can
    help more with this.\r\n\r\n\"you're not store-testing for fresher coffee\" and
    \"if he discovers\" = [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/baskerville-original-pro/10-pro-medium-italic/|Baskerville
    Italic]] (Medium?). Seems a little more condensed than most digital versions,
    but definitely Baskerville.\r\n\r\n\"Here's how easy it is to be sure\" = looks
    like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/bold-oblique/|Futura Bold Oblique]]\r\n\r\n\"Pressure
    Packed\" = Hard to tell, but looks more grotesk than Futura. Would need a larger
    specimen to be sure. Seems to be a slight curve on the leg of the /R/ ... [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/|AG
    Schoolbook]]?\r\n\r\nRest of text = impossible to say, but likely Baskerville
    Semibold Italic again.\r\n"

  body: "The 1950s were an era when ad agencies used fonts prepared by Photo Lettering
    and similar firms. So they are  likely the source of the version of Futura used
    in \"If your husband ever finds out.\"\r\nBy the way, if this ad were to run today
    it would lead to a massive anti Chase & Sanborn campaign for the patriarchal abuse
    of women shown in it. Don Draper might have thought it was a great sales attention
    grabber.\r\nDon"
