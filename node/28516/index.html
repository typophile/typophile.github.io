  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

I'm making an important typeface selection for a logo that belongs to a recruitment agency specialising in engineering, architecture and constructions.

Their current logo (mis)uses Bauhaus. [attached]
It's probably okay for the mark, but definitely doesnt work for the company name at small type sizes, not surprising for a display face.

There are a few key considerations:
<ol><li>It must be legible across print and web delivery, specifically at small sizes in newsprint.</li>
<li>They dont want to move too far from the existing design - they want me to 'clean up the mark and use a typeface that is more legible'</li>
<li>The new logo will set the scene for a mini-branding in a few months, where a new website and stationary will be produced.</li>
</ol>

For newsprint ad campaigns, so far I've mainly used DIN for display settings and Oficina Sans for body setting.

I know its seen as a cliche to use 'square sans' typefaces like DIN and Meta for engineering/architecture firms, but given the requirements, I think this is a fitting direction that is not likely to upset a fairly conservative client.

So far i'm looking at:
<a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html">Klavika</a>
Because its handsome looking, will print well on web-offset, and offers a lot of weights and variations which should make light work of stationary design later.

<a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html">Locator</a>
For similar reasons to Klavika, except that I think this looks too much like a Real-Estate magazine face.

Anyone have any other suggestions, or thoughts on my direction so far?
BTW, i didn't design the original logo!

Thanks,
Jonny</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jonny, I don't in any way mean to be facetious, but if you keep the d and b in the current positions and use a typeface with ascenders any longer than are presently in use, you are in danger of having a logo that will be reminiscent of the male genitalia in a state of arousal!

I noticed this only because I had a design student encounter something similar recently. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, that was my first thought too - very phallic! So it's not just me. I would say it's your duty to the client to tell them that has got to go. Nice looking, yes, but prone to reduce grown men and women to giggling.

I would stay away from a lowercase logo in rounded fonts for this very reason. Unless perhaps you come up with a different placement of the "d" and "b", perhaps? Maybe joining the stems together, or placing one letter higher than the other? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I agree with both of you, and it is indeed what I first thought when I saw the logo for the first time.  Let me say again, I didnt design this logo!

I will have to bring this to their attention and leave it to them to decide.  

I dont want to hijack this thread, but you might find the attached broadsheet banner advert [NX6043935.pdf] amusing.  Again, this advert was produced very much under duress.

That aside, any thoughts on typefaces?  Another idea is to use the a more decorative ampersand from another face with a square sans face.  But this is somewhat cliche too right?  You tell me!  This is my first commercial logo design gig, I'm  after all the input I can get.

Hopefully I'll be able to post something to critique shortly, but still planning at the moment.

		<div class="commentbody">You could use an ampersand, but that would lose the reflective quality, maybe using the + sign would be more engineering/architecture etc. To that end I would choose Locator (or similar) because the characters have similar characteristics when reflected.

I'll second Tim on Locator -- I think it strikes an appropriate tone for such a business.

(It still looks phallic...just a little, uh, uncomfortable.)
