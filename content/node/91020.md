  Squirrel: [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/amble|Amble]].\r\n\r\nI say surprised
  because I had not seen any discussion of it here at Typophile, which \u2013 as they
  say \u2013 is a Punchcut gig.\r\n\r\nAmble looks similar to [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/droid-sans-pro-mono.aspx|Droid]],
  doesn't it?\r\n\r\nI'm curious: has anyone seen a release notice for Amble or a
  critique of the typeface?\r\n"

    Robertson]] is credited with the design of Amble, and it is copyright 2009.

  body: "John, Amble was designed by [[Punchcut]]. In 2010 Sun licensed it for inclusion
    in the JavaFX SDK for mobile handsets. Thanks for pointing out the FontSquirrel
    link. Any similarity to [[Droid]] stems from a similar creative brief over at
    [[Ascender Corp]].\r\n\r\nWe use a web optimized version of Amble on <a href=\"http://www.punchcut.com\">our
    site</a> as well, but it's not available in the SDK."

    strange - it's the hinting problem? "
