<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm researching typefaces that contain lowercase d's and p's without main stroke terminations. <br> <br>In the case of the d it wouldn't end on the baseline but would continue into the bowl stroke and in the case of the p it wouldn't end on the x height but would again continue into the bowl stroke. <br> <br>Gill Sans light and roman and Jeremy Tankard's Bliss come to mind. Are there others? <br>(I'm excluding faces like Dax and Prokyon as they employ a different approach all together) <br> <br>I'm interested in this practice but remain skeptical because to my eye the d tends to float along the baseline without the termination stroke. <br> <br>Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br> <br>Best, <br>Eric O.</div>

<div class=commentbody>My fault. You're right. <br>The bold is built this same way but strangely the Extra Bold is not. It shares the terminations of the Roman. <br> <br>This is however all based on available digital versions. On page 90 of Tracy's Letters of Credit it mentions the d and p as characters that were later revised during manufacturing and goes on to show (on the next page) images of terminating d's and p's. </div>

But one that can be achieved if one proceeds very carefully. <br> <br>Of course, the interaction with other characters in the design is highly important. <br> <br>That's not to say that it's more crucial than in faces where there are more 'usual' stem terminations. <br> <br>The interaction just needs to be watched carefully, to avoid the optical bounce. In general, if it's not a non-aligning face, and it appears to have noticable bounce, then it would probably be safe to say that it wasn't designed properly. <br> <br>Even in faces like our TF Vignette, or another mentioned example, Linotype Banjoman, it's a matter of testing to see how high or low the join ought to be to look most pleasing (most innocuous, really) to the eye. <br> <br>I think it can be a very useful affectation. <br> <br>However, it seems to me that what the technique can contribute to the lower left corner of b is a more thorny issue. <br> <br>Much more often, if it's not handled well in that very delicate spot, it's easy to permanently wound an entire typeface. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>Bernhard Gothic: was this the first? <br> <br> <br>Well, so far, it would seem so. <br>(Bernhard Gothic being introduced by 1930). <br> <br>Influencers of Mr. Bernhard for those particular shape decisions, earlier on, might have been these: <br> <br>Quentell, 1895, ATF <br>Dormer (later 'Pekin'), 1888, Great Western <br>Buddy (later 'Roycroft'), 1898, M. F. Benton <br>Authors Oldstyle, 1902, BB&S <br>Bullfinch Oldstyle, 1903, for Curtis Publishing <br>Hobo, 1910, ATF <br>The 'b', inverted, from ATF's Souvenir, 1914, M. F. Benton. <br>Advertiser's Gothic, 1917, BB&S <br>Greeting Monotone, 1927, ATF <br>Ultra Modern Italic (just the 'd'), Ludlow Typograph, somewhere between 1928 and 1931 <br> <br>...and in the case of the 'd', the lower right quadrant shaping of various uncials. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>You know, I completely neglected to mention one of my favorites: <br> <br>Ozwald Bruce Cooper's aparently unnamed brush letter (1930), the roman of which is shown on pp.158-159 of 'The Book of Oz Cooper', The Society of Typographic Arts, Chicago, 1949. <br> <br>Done originally just for a 1930 Harper & Brothers book called 'American Alphabets', by Paul Hollister. <br> <br>What's especially fascinating about this is how Cooper devised the completely different way of terminal joining. <br> <br>I don't know if there was ever a name assigned to the technique (which seems to be all Cooper's). <br> <br>But it's rather like a negative terminal, or a low terminal. Ending flat (effectively), but with the bowl joining very low away from the x-height. <br> <br>Without sacrificing the round of the bowl (round as in Bernhard Gothic's) at all. Rather, accentuating it. <br> <br>Astonishing, really. <br> <br>Talk about a set of drawings that'll make your eyes roll back! <br> <br>I know that A*I revived it as A*I Oz Brush about 1990. But it appears to be somewhat different from what I can tell from Font Book specimens. Perhaps it's a little haphazard? Hard to tell whether it was fully true to the brushed spontaneity of Cooper's masterpiece. <br> <br>I wonder if anyone knows whether Hollister's publishing of his book introducing Cooper's letter predated the release of Bernhard Gothic? <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br></div>
