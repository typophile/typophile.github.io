body: I think the balance between typeface crits and &#34;composition&#34; crits has
  lately become very lopsided in favor of the latter. I remember the trend starting
  shortly before TypeCon04, and since then there was a short burst of typeface crits,
  but now it&#39;s pretty meek. You could say we&#39;re being shown fewer fonts worth
  critiquing lately, but surely it&#39;s a mutual thing; when obviously good designs
  are virtually ignored by almost all Typophilers, people are clealy less likely to
  show good stuff - there&#39;s probably more loss than gain since you&#39;re getting
  some measly crits in return for exposing your baby prematurely. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
  <BR>Even though it&#39;s only positive that Typophile can serve as a forum for composition
  crits, I think it&#39;s fair to say that there are much more people who make compositions
  than type, and much more people who seem to feel confident engaging in composition
  critique than type critique. Furthermor, we all have variously limited time to devote
  to Typophile in the first place, and this means if somebod spends 2 hours critiquing
  compositions instead of 1 hour, that&#39;s 1 hour less to devote to type crits.
  All this means we have to make en effort to preserve our invaluable ecosystem, where
  type crits are vital. We can&#39;t just build a city with no regard to the environment,
  otherwise our community won&#39;t last in <i>any</i> form. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>To
  me Typophile owes a large part of its prominence to being a singular hub of quality
  type crits. Now it seems there&#39;s a danger that the majority voice of composition
  will drown out the vital niche minority. So I would simply urge people to balance
  their time here so that the blood that feeds the whole of typography doesn&#39;t
  become depleted. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: from personal experience, it&#39;s disheartening to post something for critique
    and get little or no response. i realize that what i&#39;m doing isn&#39;t always
    everybody&#39;s cup of tea, but even just one comment or two is good enough feedback
    to keep one motivated. sometimes i feel bad and try my best to leave a crit, even
    though i&#39;m sure there are so many more qualified individuals on the boards
    that could do a better job than i. anyhow, even you miss one sometimes, hrant.

    <BR>Hrant, I completely agree, particularly since I am one of these people. <BR>
    <BR>This seems like a good place for this question as well: I&#39;m a graphic

  body: Thanks, Chris, for your appreciative words. <BR> <BR>It is notable that experienced
    type designers, with the noted exception of Hrant, rarely enter the typeface sections
    to critique, and when they do, they offer a few words of encouragement or a point,
    and then go. <BR> <BR>Now I understand this better. For the past two years I have
    been entering the critique board, first with elaborate apologies, now less so,
    with the idea that critiquing and getting feedback from the designer and other
    critiques of the face would sharpen my own eye. It has indeed been a valuable
    education, for which I am grateful to Typophile - including Hrant!  <BR> <BR>At
    this point, I see that to give a full and proper critique of a face at this stage
    of my knowledge is going to be very difficult. I now know enough to be able to
    do a better job, but it would be so much work that I would be foolish not to put
    in the time on my own work instead &#40;both as a writer and designer&#41;. Maybe
    when I am at a later stage I can critique thoroughly at a glance. But I&#39;m
    not there yet by a long shot. And if ever I get there, I can imagine that I will
    feel like I should get paid for my time, given the time and effort I will have
    put in to get to that point.  <BR> <BR>If more experienced type designers would
    join in more often, it would be great. But I do understand better where they are
    coming from now. The boards are still a valuable training and testing ground in
    any case. And it would be nice if the more experienced designers dropped in more
    often. But for the reasons I have given, I don&#39;t expect it to happen.  <BR>
    <BR>That being said, a great pleasure of entering the boards is to see wonderful
    new talents entering the field, and creating excitment with their work. So thanks
    to all the posters!

    my own stuff which is already behind schedule. &#40;Probably I should spend less
    time on Typophile in general, but most of that is in short blips which don&#39;t
    seem as &#34;expensive.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>Not that I am asserting any great expertise

  body: I think it depends more on personality and lifestyle &#40;which admittedly
    is sometimes chosen <i>for</i> you to some extent&#41;. In my own case, my engrained
    bohemian nature&#42; as well as the way my parents &#40;especially my mom&#41;
    raised me is more than enough impetus to spend some part of the day critiquing
    other people&#39;s fonts. <BR> <BR>&#42; Like I want to be a toga model when I
    grow up.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I guess it depends what &#34;full and proper critique&#34;
    means to each of us and how important we consider it. For example it doesn&#39;t
    take me long &#40;like 2 minutes&#41; to look at a PDF and point out that the
    vertical proportions, color and spacing are imbalanced and recommend a correction
    direction. It might take me another five if I want to get into specific glyph
    issue. Or if I see an overall ideological problem I&#39;ll just state that and
    probably avoid going into moot details. I wouldn&#39;t consider any of this &#34;thorough&#34;
    but I do consider it helpful &#40;assuming I know what I&#39;m talking about,
    for which I&#39;ll never have proof however&#41;. And not that I&#39;m remotely
    at his level, but how much time does Carter spend on each font during type crits
    at Typecon? Five, maybe ten minutes. Is <i>that</i> a useless exercise? <BR> <BR>That
    said, I also don&#39;t expect to see many experienced type designers suddenly
    contribute free time here &#40;although some, like John H, kindly do&#41;. But
    that doesn&#39;t make everything OK, and I have to say that I attribute that in
    part to a lack of grace. Helping your fellow human is a good thing - it&#39;s
    really that simple for me. It can&#39;t fix everything, but it&#39;s still a good
    thing. <BR> <BR>&#34;I hold every man a debtor to his profession, from the which,

  body: I agree, Hrant, that it is in large part a question of personality, although
    perhaps not in the way that you mean. I simply find it very hard to give typeface
    design critiques in writing. But I find it very easy to give personal, one-on-one
    critiques, and am always happy to do so if time permits. I lost track of how many
    student typeface designs I critiqued sitting on the stairs at ATypI in Prague.
    But I find the critique section of Typophile quite overwhelming, so have never
    more than dipped in my toe. <BR> <BR>Excellent Bacon quote.

    <BR> <BR>What I mean it work really better to do critics when you are actually
    side by side with the person. Pointing a problem and explaining why it doesn&#39;t
    work take 2 mn in real life, when it can take 20 mn in virtual life. From my own
    experience, its frustrating on booth sides. <BR> <BR>And this apply including
    with people you know well, work you have seen by the past in real and already
    critiqued. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, I get the feeling that people who do critics please
    themselves showing to others, by the number of post, length of them, they are
    the best in this world. Like looking on a mirror? I just try to say that doing
    type critics is not for ourselves ego but for others. <BR> <BR>Last but not least,
    most of earlier problems are generally the sames in many cases, its just basics
    skills, and reading some old critics can do better job than asking again and again.
    A web forum, a chat, an email discussion never remplace a proper exchange between
    people in real life, from what you can found in schools to in type foundries &#40;small
    or large&#41;, sadly.

  body: There is, as JFP says, no substitute for a face-to-face critique.  In the
    best of all possible worlds I would certainly prefer this to any virtual critique.  The
    problem is that we are scattered throughout the world and many of us do not have
    ready access to other people with type design expertise. The option then becomes
    virtual critique or none. <BR>I would be very honored to have one-on-one critique
    of my work by a renowned designer such as J.F. Porchez.  I realize that this is
    not possible not only because I am thousands of miles away but I would not be
    so presumptuous as to ask him for his valuable time.  I do feel that presenting
    my work online in the Typophile critique area is a way of asking, those of my
    peers who may choose to, for a critique without putting anyone in the uncomfortable
    position of having to say no. <BR>Mr. Porchez&#39;s comment, &#34;. . .most of
    earlier problems are generally the sames in many cases, its just basics skills,
    and reading some old critics can do better job than asking again and again&#34;
    is a point well taken for the accomplished type designer but for those of us who
    are new to the profession, it is ALL new.  I think there is room for peer review
    even if they do no more than point the person to an existing link or previous
    critique. <BR>Many of us work in a vacuum and the solitary nature of the work
    sometimes makes us want to cry out to the type community just to know others are
    having the same struggle. Perhaps we are just seeking to cast our bread on the
    waters and let whatever fish nibble if they are so inclined. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 'Certainly there are huge advantages to doing a crit in person, not least
    the simple issue of &#34;interface&#34;: it&#39;s much more efficient to point
    at something and speak, rather than draw corrections on the computer and type
    stuff up. But a Typophile crit has its own advantages. Besides the obvious removal
    of the geographic barrier, there&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s public; this makes
    the education &#34;massively parallel&#34; - I know I&#39;ve learned a lot from
    reading other people&#39;s crits. Also, sometimes a public crit spawns a fruitful
    discussion of how best to do something, which can&#39;t happen with only two people
    &#40;with a one-way relationship to boot&#41;. When Randy puts up &#40;or I should

    I won&#39;t deny that there are also selfish reasons to do crits, at least in
    my case: I learn a lot myself just from the process and the formalization; and
    yes, I do get exposure, hence sales and commissions - but I don&#39;t expect to
    be looked down upon for that by people who do type design for a living! :-&#41;
    As for the &#34;ego&#34; angle, I think it might be true sometimes, but it&#39;s
    really not very relevant if the results are useful to others - and since a steady
