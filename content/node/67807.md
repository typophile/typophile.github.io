  target=\"new\">MADType</a> for more info.\r\n\r\nAudebaud is the first release that
  contains my new multi-language character set. It covers more languages than Adobe
  Latin 3.\r\n\r\nI am also in the process of updating all of my previously released
  fonts with various types of fixes. They will all be OpenType, some with more features
  than others. You should see them up soon."

    the 'Q'. Its tail seems a bit odd to me."

  body: There's an alternate Q that is more "Clarendon" in the OT features. The Q
    shown is original to the wood specimen. There are also square versions of the
    i, j, and all of the punctuation for a more primitive feel.

  body: Thanks for the input, I'll look into it. The images on the YWFT site were
    not done by me, but the above were.

  body: I think the issue was that I made the type layouts in Illustrator and then
    pasted them into photoshop. That doesn't give you much control over aliasing.

    with Adobe Rosewood Fill.
