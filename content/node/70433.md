  title font \"Verdana\" to \"Titillium\". I'm spekaing of the code \"font-face\".
  Many fonts as those, in the Fonts folder in my own computer. Did you understand?
  I also changed the text font and text title to the fonts that don't exist: Titillium,
  Calibri, Segoe Print, Segoe Script, Lucida Sans Unicode, etc.. On my computer, the
  fonts exist. But when I went to cyber caf\xE9 or \"LAN house\", to see my blog,
  the fonts of the blog title, text and title text, etc. did not work, because the
  other computers those fonts din't exist or appear exactly, or those fonts were not
  installed in the Fonts folder of the other computers. At the blog, accept, recognise
  and there are only six fonts, including Comic Sans MS, which already existed and
  was installed on all computers. So how do I install the fonts in my own blog for
  that the fonts work on all computers that do not have those fonts? Then @font-face
  doesn't work!\r\n\r\nI know you counsel me not to use those fonts, but only the
  standardised fonts by the Blogger. But see the text at the site of FontsQuirrel,
  the fonts there work perfectly althought I don't have these fonts, but I know what
  the font are these!\r\n\r\nDo I mean @web-font? Does it work perfectly?\r\n\r\nKevin"

    is how you can reference fonts located on a server that then are loaded into the
    browser for that page. For that to work you have to either create web formats
    of the fonts and put them on your web server, or use one of the hosted options
    such as FontSquirrel, Kernest, Typekit, etc."

  body: kevin - try this tutorial on using Kernest with Blogger http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2009/08/using-new-fonts-from-kernest-on-blogger.html
    Kernest's UI has updated since it was originally written, but the concepts still
    hold.

  body: "I advice you that font-family has some problems. Only css3 is being prepared
    to accept non-standard fonts.\r\nI think that you should go with a strategy like
    Titillium, Verdana , like this, everyone that has Titillium will see with Titillium
    and whoever doesnt have it will be able to see with verdana and maybe, when css3
    gets compatibility on all browsers you may try to use a non-standard typeface"
