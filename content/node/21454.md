body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to produce class based kerning in FL 4.5, I'll explain
  what I've done so far.\r\n\r\n1. Created Classes named _A, _B etc. and created a
  key glyph within these classes using a single quote after the glyph.\r\n\r\n2. Created
  kerning for these key glyphs A-0, A-C etc.\r\n\r\n3. In the Opentype kerning Assistance
  panel I selected all the classes in both the left and right side and clicked Apply
  and Save.\r\n\r\n4. Then in the Opentype panel I have a kern feature.\r\n\r\n5.
  I click compile, but don't get any output message. When I check the preview panel
  I dont have any kern feature there.\r\n\r\nHelp \r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong
  ?"

    liga;</code>\r\nand compile.\r\nYou should be able to see <code>liga</code> and
    <code>kern</code> now."
