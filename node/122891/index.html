  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all!

I'm part of a reddit group dedicated to researching for missing/unidentified persons. Full story [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe|here]], and more specifically [[http:/www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/2tzr5l/virgo_tattoo|here]].

 I'm reaching out to this forum because the person whose case we're investigating now, had a tattoo in his arm with a word written on it that looks unintelligible. It looks like latin alphabet, but it seems like everyone has different opinions about what's written there.

Here are the only pictures we have of the tattoos, not great quality:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCD1_5632.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCD2_6305.jpg]

It reads so odd... It seems to me that it might have been a different word before and he subsequently tried to cover it up, but who knows, this could have been his tattoo since the beginning.

I'm trying to figure out whether this is a modified word or not. If it's not, what does it mean; and if it is, what did it say before modifications.

For easiness of exposure, let's imagine it says "Vagon":

  - the V is strangely skewed: usually V's are symmetrical: \/, or otherwise leaning right: |/  but this one seems to be the other way around: \|
  - also, why would the left part of the V go so high up, is this normal in any typography?
  - what other letter could this have been?
  - the next letter could have originally been an "i", transformed into an "a", plus  a strange squirrel tail to the top right...
  -  and crossing the dot of the "i" to make it look like it's not an i's dot?
  - why is the top and right part of this letter, as well as the squirrel tail, thicker than the rest?
  - the "g" is s off... the size of the ("counter"? "bowl"?) round part of the letter is tiny compared to the previous "a", or the subsequent "o". Looks like a transformation? "j" to "g"?
  - if this was a cover up from "j" to "g" (and the "squirrel tail" of the "a" was covering the dot of a "j") then that leaves us with "ij" next to each other, but then the "ij" letters seem to be too spread apart for this.
  - the ending "n" doesn't really look like an "n", more like another strange tail for the "o", so I'm not sure what to think about this.

So, the pics are not good quality, and the skewness in the letters could be due to skin condition or photographic angle. Also, I'm not in any way an expert in typography, and also I have no clue if the tattoos were modified or not. The police report does say they the tattoos seemed to be recent. There was apparently also another tattoo where "A globe surrounded by letters on the left forearm. According to the autopsy report the letters were 'Illegible and not English'". The pics for this other tattoo are not available.

Anyone in this forum would like to share their thoughts? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, it says "Virgo". The peculiarities are consistent with an amateur attempt to be artistic. A cross for a dot is not unusual in contexts where a simple dot would be impractical, particularly to mark it as intentional where other spots can occur.</div>
