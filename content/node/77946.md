body: "I am trying to run FixDFLTScriptTagSL.py and it is not working. My Fonttools
  and python installations are, at least as I understand it, the versions included
  with the latest version of Robofog. Here is there error that I get when I run the
  macro in Fontlab: \r\n\r\nLocating OpenType fonts in /Users/jpad/Dropbox/fonts/Lorimer_Final/1.0_Fonts...\r\nTraceback
  (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 108, in ?\r\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/codecs.py\",
  line 205, in __getattr__\r\n    return getattr(self.stream, name)\r\nAttributeError:
  stdout_hook instance has no attribute 'flush'\r\n\r\nDo I need to install Fonttools
  again separately from Robofab to make this script work? And if so, that would also
  require me to install Numpy, the latest version of which requires me to update my
  system python to 2.6; will doing that break Python in Fontlab/Robofab or will Fontlab/Robofab
  continue to use the Python 2.5 as installed by Robofab?"

  body: "I see. I've been successfully using FontLab Studio with the system-own Python
    2.5, by applying the procedure described at: \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/python\r\n\r\nIt's
    also possible to \"link\" FontLab Studio with the MacPython.org Python, by redirecting
    the /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3 folder to that one.
    But I agree that it's a somewhat nasty business. "

    with that in hopes of not breaking anything else. Hopefully Fontlab 6 will arrive
    this year and I won\u2019t have to worry about so much of this stuff :)"
