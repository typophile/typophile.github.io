  similar in feel to the text face for Dwell magazine... does anyone know what that
  is?

  body: The text face is a serif and seems to me to be somewhat like melior, but lighter.
    I just discovered this site so I&#39;m not sure yet how to post an image

  body: Thanks all! You made my day. I&#39;ve been searching all over trying to figure
    it out. Now, so as not to be the same ... any ideas of a similar font for use
    in my pub?

  body: 'For a serif with Proforma&#39;s &#34;tradition with a twist&#34;, take a
    look at Borges from PampaType. I just got the printed specimen book in the mail
    today, and it&#39;s a beauty. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pampatype.com/English.html"

    <BR> <BR>As far as sans go, I prefer News Gothic to Trade Gothic, if you&#39;re
    looking for something that&#39;s &#42;really&#42; similar. <BR> <BR>If you want
    a relatively neutral modern sans, that still has some of the character of the
    the gothics, consider FF Kievit: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=FF.11231.0.0"

  body: I am currently using News Gothic and do like it as well. I also like lightline
    gothic, which I used in a photographers monograph many years ago. Haven&#39;t
    tried looking for it yet, but with this much assistance, perhaps .... Thanks for
    the other suggestions. I&#39;ll take a look.
