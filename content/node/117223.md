body: "Two designers quoted the Middle Age era in the lower case \"g\": \r\n1. Jan
  Van Krimpen with the italics of <em>Lutetia, Roman\xE9e, Haarlemmer, Spectrum</em>\r\n2.
  Eric Gill with the italics of <em>Perpetua, Golden Cockerel, Joanna, Aries</em>\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\xB6
  Do you know who's started this italic \"g\" trend?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nPS: I've noticed
  the medieval \"g\" in the italics of <em>ITC Galliard</em> and <em>ITC Esprit</em>."

  body: It seems to me that the model for this kind of |g| (and also for the stemmed
    |U| which some of your examples also share) is "just" a stylisation of connected
    cursive handwriting, thus it could well be that there's no one "who's started
    this italic "g" trend".
