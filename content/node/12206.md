  short version:\r\n\r\nFormaly known as <em>Schriftgie\xDFerey der Andre\xE4ischen

  Andre\xE4, who bought in 1666 shares of a press in Frankfurt am Main. In 1779 Benjamin
  Andre\xE4 adopted the young co-worker Johann Geaorg Augustin Krebs and passed all
  his property to him and his wife. In 1839 the name was changed into Benjamin Krebs.
  The foundry worked till its liquidation in 1933. The foundries [[Ludwig und Mayer]],
  [[D. Stempel AG]] and [[Klingspor]] take over the materials."
