body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI need to find fonts that a similar to this script font. This one
  is probably a custom designed logotype, but it doesn't have to be exactly like this.
  Just something which is tasting a little \"vintage, 50s and pin-up\".\r\n\r\nProbably
  a weird description \u2014 but any suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/buffet-script/|Buffet Script]]
    using some stylistic alternates... You may like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/storefront-pro/|Storefront]]
