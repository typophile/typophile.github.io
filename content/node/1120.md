body: I am going to start studing some type faces so I made a specimen wich groups
  main glyphs by familiar shapes, shows the vertical proportions and three different
  paragraph settings, one of them helping to measure type space efficiency &#40;do
  = 1000 glyphs&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would like to have some commentaries about how could
  I improve this tool for the study of a type face. The lower case glyphs are about
  2 picas height and the upper case about 3.I

  body: 'This is really useful. I mean really. <BR> <BR>You can add a lot of stuff,
    but start with the basics, like you have. I&#39;d have to think what non-alphanumeric
    characters to add &#40;eventually&#41;, but some quick observations for now: <BR>-
    Have a regular alphabet setting too &#40;at least a-z&#41;. <BR>- Use the cap
    height as a secondary vertical measure, instead of using it to determine the percentages.
    <BR>- Show the percentage of &#34;internal leading&#34; too. <BR> <BR>And on subsequent
    pages you might have: <BR>- Some key words &#40;like &#34;the&#34;&#41; set large.
    <BR>- Width calculations. <BR>- Many other wonderful things!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;
    spanish linguistics on type design improvement. <BR> <BR>Hey, there&#39;s really
    nothing written about that for <i>English</i>. You&#39;ve got yourself a superb
    topic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#62; width measurements <BR> <BR>The simple one is lc alphabet length. <BR>But
    a smarter one takes letter frequency into account, but then that gets language-specific.
    <BR> <BR>Internal leading is the sum of the space above the ascenders plus below
    the descenders, and it&#39;s a big determinant of the face&#39;s apparent size
    &#40;for a given point size&#41;. In some designs &#40;mosly script faces with
    small x-heights&#41; it can actually be negative! But usually it&#39;s about 10%.
