body: "My latest type design and first MyFonts release is called Raniscript. The name
  was inspired by some images of vintage matchbook designs advertising the Flying
  Rani. Raniscript is based on a ronde style script, but with some contemporary touches.
  It comes fully loaded with contextual alternates, swashes, case sensitive punctuation,
  and a set of caps that are designed for caps only settings.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/raniscript/\r\n\r\nStephen[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Raniscript_1_4312.png]"
