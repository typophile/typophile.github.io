  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi
I&rsquo;ve been using fontographer for a decade now, been through classic, waiting for osx, finally osx version by FL, but what now. Should I keep waiting for FL to upgrade Fontographer or is it time to switch to FontLab? I know it&rsquo;s a question of taste and use, but is there hope for a Fontographer update (OT and bug fixes).</p>
<p>The reason, more people are asking for my fonts in OT format. Converting is an option, but creating is out with only 256 char. set in Fontographer.</p>
<p>Or is this just oldskool hanging on to Fontographer?</p>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">FontLab has been the king of font production for some time now. How long exactly? Four years? Five years? Maybe a lot longer than that? If I were you, I would switch. Upgrading won&rsquo;t make you a better designer by any means, but it will allow you to get your fonts out onto today&rsquo;s market much quicker.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fontourist,</p>
<p>I have been enjoying the best of both worlds for awhile.</p>
<p>I have been using professionally Fontographer since Altsys and John Von Ehr of Texas created the program in the eighties. With every new version, they send out a long detailed questionaire and wish list, where a user could describe his peeves and wishes upon how to improve the program. Over 90% of my wishes were implemented, and I sent them many pages of details.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I upgraded to FontLab at the advice of Paul Nelson, formerly of the Microsoft Typography Group. Now, it is headed by Simon Daniels, here on Typophile.</p>
<p>I use Fontographer for my creative and font editing work, and generate my end results in FontLab, as I find Fontographer&rsquo;s user interface very intuitive.</p>
<p>Certainly, if FontLab would upgrade Fontographer to have OpenType support, this would be great, but I doubt if FontLab will invest the resources to cause users not to purchase FontLab.</p>
<p>Btw, Fontographer supports Unicode and breaks the 256 character limit for a long time. Support though is terrible. I don&rsquo;t think that there is an online user group.</p>
<p>So, if you can justtify the investment, you can use both programs, or just patiently learn the FontLab user interface. If you are not a professional, and only use your font creations for personal use, you could always just continue using Fontographer for OSX; similarly, if you don&rsquo;t need OpenType or the nuances of recent Unicode enhancements in various foriegn languages, then you can just stick with Fontographer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Israel Seldowitz has it about right. I too used Fontographer since the late 80s. It was comfortable, and still does a few things better than FontLab. It also had a lot of bugs we all worked around. A few years after FL came out, I&rsquo;d do most of the work in Fontographer but run the final files through FL to get rid of those bugs &ndash; &amp; I wasn&rsquo;t the only one. I remember describing this at a meeting &amp; seeing David Berlow&rsquo;s head nodding up &amp; down . . .</p>
<p>Eventually, you get more comfortable with FL, &amp; will probably use it instead of Fontographer. I think you will need FL to make your OpenType fonts. There are other ways, other programs, but if (like me) you&rsquo;re more &ldquo;type&rdquo; than &ldquo;computer,&rdquo; FL is probably the easiest route.</p>

Helped me decide to buy an upgrade to Fontlab. (they, FL offer a reduction when buying Fontlab if you already own Fontographer:-)</p>
<p>One quick question, how do you import the fog file into Fontlab?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We have plans to continue work on Fontographer, but we don&rsquo;t plan any immediate releases. We want to rethink the whole application from the ground up and create a font editor that is focused on design rather than on technical work, while making it still very suitable for the needs of the 21st century.</p>
<p>But this will not happen anytime real soon. We have FontLab Studio 6 in the works, with a much more clear release horizon (sometime within the next 10 months, I would say), while the Fontographer effort is more long-distance.</p>
<p>In the end, our plan is to have Fontographer as a tool that is focused on design of letterforms and at the same time hide all the unnecessary technical details from the user, while FontLab Studio will the same design tools as the new Fontographer but on top of that will allow people fine control over the production aspect.</p>
<p>Certainly, you&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong by switching to FontLab Studio now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nobody complains about Fontlab more trenchantly than me, I think I have earned my creds in that respect, but I resent it when people say it crashes every five minutes. I use it extensively on Mac and PC and find it remarkably stable. As with all programs, the more complex the input you throw at it, the more likely it is to hiccup. Those working on huge fonts might take a tip from the old days of word processing (the 1990s!), when we would split a complex document into 20-page segments and only assemble at the last possible moment, to avoid crashes. Those working on very complex fonts may have to adopt similar strategies. Considering how varied and unpredictable the input to Fontlab can be (especially when you consider add-ons), I&rsquo;d even go so far as to say it is a remarkably stable program. Looking forward to a great 21st w/ Flab!</div>
