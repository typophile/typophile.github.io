  well with Font Bureau's Griffith Gothic? Samples here:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic\r\n\r\nThis
  is a history book \"for dummies\", on the history of Israel, with a slightly more
  sophisticated bent than the actual \"for dummies\" book series. The application
  might carry over onto a companion website.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input\r\n\r\n/\\/\\\r\nMeir

    posted</a> a piece he lovely designed with Griffith and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Miller\">Miller</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    also think <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/itc_charter_ot/\">ITC
    Charter</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_clifford/\">FF
    Clifford</a> would work well with Griffith, depending on how traditional you want
    the look."
