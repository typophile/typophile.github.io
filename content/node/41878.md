body: "A sub-genre of [[blackletter]] scripts. Like all blackletter and humanist scripts,
  this evolved over the Middle Ages from [[Carolingian miniscules]]. The main characteristic
  is that of rounded letterforms, or rather curves that are broken os less places
  than other blackletters. It does not have the strict vertical stress of the [[textura]]
  style of blackletter.\r\n\r\nRotunda letters, also called <em>Rundgotisch</em> in
  German, were more popular in Southern Europe as printing was inaugurated, whereas
  the textura and the [[bastarda]] seemed to dominate Northern Europe.\r\n\r\n<strong>Popular
  Rotunda Typefaces</strong>\r\n[[Wallau]]\r\nWeiss Rundgotisch"
