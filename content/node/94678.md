  I like the uneven, and hand painted look of it. I imagine this was hand painted,
  but if anyone knows of anything similar, I'd love to know.\r\n\r\nImage attached.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stock-photo-cricket-scoreboard-938939_5939.jpg]"

  body: thanks NikaOo - it looks a lot chunkier and more uneven that Leitura I think
