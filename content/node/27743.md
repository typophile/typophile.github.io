  body: "Mostly what makes them 'no fun' is when they are old, pre-digital lettering.
    The closest I can think of to this is a digitization of Adscript by Jason Walcott
    (Jukebox), called <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000002\">\"Adage\"</a>\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for the reply, Mike.\r\n\r\nYeah, I saw Adage, it's in the ballpark.
    From the printing though, I dont think the art is pre-digital. DVD was released
    in 1997, and sleeve design looks like an original composition. Type has crisp
    postscript-quality shapes. Could be custom, or a really good scan of vintage type?"

    the actual title in the movie is the same script?\r\n\r\n(edit: This is not the
    movie film title from 1950, according to this view of the title screen <a href=\"http://www.shillpages.com/movies/aa.shtml\">
    here</a> in the Stephen Hill pages.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm really leaning to some sort of custom lettering then. I have looked through
    the Jaspert Encyclopaedia, all the Solotype books I have, the Photo-Lettering
    catalogs, and my own Script Font ID Guide, and the only other semi-close script
    I can find is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monotype-script/\">Monotype
    Script Bold</a>.\r\n\r\nFor one thing the inital 'A' is very unusual, starting
    with the fact that that style of round A is relatively rare to begin with. The
    next oddity is the connections between letters, which are high, unlike most fonts.
    My eyeballs aren't precise enough to see if there are any variations in the identical
    letters, but if this was made in 1997, a customized font is certainly possible.
    It just seems so unlikely for such a limited-value purpose, in my opinion. I mean,
    it's not even a logotype. \r\n\r\nIf someone does ID this, I will be very interested
    in the answer. It sure has me stumped so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Wow - Mike, thanks for spending the time researching this, and thanks for
    the Shillpages link (love that site, my second favorite place on the web). I actually
    did check there before starting this thread.\r\n\r\nThe thing that attracted me
    to this script was the high connections. If it exists as a font it's the perfect
    face for the design I'm working on. The identical letters don't appear to have
    variations, but that wouldnt necessarily mean it's a font, since custom letters
    can be copied and pasted just the same as anything else. I'm going to continue
    to search for this - I'll post here if I find anything."

    queries. \r\nThis All About Eve thread is especially interesting, as I've for
    a long time now tried to track down the font for the opening titles of this movie
    as I love the elegance and creativity of this and many other movie titles.\r\nBut
    even more importantly \"how did they make the titles?\" I know about rostrum cameras
    etc., but was the image created as a flat handmade artwork? (the shadows are a
    little inconsistent but the type is perfect). Can anyone point me at a source
    of information about this subject?\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/all-about-eve-title-still_6320.jpg]"
