  working with automatic ligatures I tried doing:\r\n\r\nsub 4 5 by 45 ;\r\n\r\nThis
  caused error. When my dumb self realized the numbers went as: one, two, three, etc.
  I tried to do:\r\n\r\nsub four five by 45 ;\r\n\r\nStill error. So I did:\r\n\r\nsub
  four five by E45;\r\n\r\nAnd it worked. So my basic question is: Why does Font Lab
  ligature code not like numbers?"

  body: "You have to use glyph names, not literal characters. In the case of some
    glyphs, these happen to be the same (A, B, C, a, b, c, etc.), but most glyphs
    names are not the same as the literal character that you type (e.g., numbers).
    The other thing is that glyph names may not start with a number (e.g., A1 is allowed,
    1A is not).\r\n\r\nThere are also conventions and recommendations for naming glyphs.
    You don't <i>have</i> to follow them, but it's usually best unless you have a
    good reason not to. It can make a difference when, for example, making a PDF that
    uses your font.\r\n\r\nGuidelines here (see section 6): http://sourceforge.net/adobe/aglfn/wiki/AGL%20Specification/"
