  body: "I'm afraid you were misled by the W.\r\nNo, Kabel has slanted line ends throughout.
    We  need something to fit the R and the S and that leads us to Futura. The W is
    made of two Vs. Medium or semibold weight to get a pointed V. \r\nMaybe the R
    was altered a little. This is a logo after all and not just a paper headline.
    \r\n\r\nPS: the figures are Copperplate Gothic"
