  body: This is an old pre-digital display version of Palatino Bold. I don't know
    if a digital version exists.

  body: The current official digital version (distributed by Linotype and designed
    by Zapf) has a serif on the crossbar of the E and other differences in detail.
    Seems like every time the technology changes, Zapf redesigns Palatino.

    was not done on a computer? It is a very old company. I think it might be possible
    to go ahead now.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nZeb"
