body: I know I am going to kick myself when this is ID&#39;ed. I should know it. This
  is the font used on all the Helboy story titles. I thought it was Souvenir. But
  I looked at ITC&#39;s Souvenir and it doesn&#39;t have the slanted back on the &#34;a&#34;.

  have been beating myself up trying to track this down. I know it should be simple.
