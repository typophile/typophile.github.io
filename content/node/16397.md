body: "Hi, I'm working on my final exam for a typography course, I have to show an
  example of a logo with each classification type. Right now I'm \"stuck\", I can't
  find anymore logos to show as an example and thats why I decided to post over here
  for help. The logos need to be very well known, like coca cola, google, etc... because
  I live in chile and the logo needs to be known over here.\r\n\r\nI also have my
  doubts regarding some logos I have, I don't know what font they are or in what category
  of the classification they belong, thats why I added an attachment with the logos
  in case anyone could ID them. \r\n\r\nCould you help me?\r\n\r\nso far I have:\r\n-venetian:
  Chivas Regal, berkeley old style\r\n-Garalde:  ??\r\n-Transitional: ??\r\n-Didone:
  Calvin Klein, bodoni \r\nSlab Serif: m&m, rockwell \r\n\r\nSans Serif\r\n- Grotesk:
  government of chile logo\r\n- Neo-grotesk: Toyota\r\n- Geometric: ??\r\n- Humanist:
  Saab\r\n\r\nBlackletter\r\n- Textura: ??\r\n- Rotunda: ??\r\n- Schwabacher: ?? \r\n-
  Fraktur: Corona?\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is a Geometric\r\nNestl\xE9 is a Neo-grotesk\r\nwhiskas is a Wedge Serif\r\nRipley
    is a Garalde\r\nMost logos are not a direct use of a font but adaptations or drawn
    from scratch based on styles.\r\nIf you want to understand the classification
