  body: "Webtype? You mean you saw this on a webpage? Your browser can tell you the
    name of embedded fonts or you can use an add-in like \"whatfont\" to do this.
    If I've lost you here, post the url and we can ID the font for you.\r\nDon"

    search might turn up something closer but this is a general match for all three
    numerals.\r\nDon"
