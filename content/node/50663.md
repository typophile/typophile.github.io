  histories, lit, humor poetry etc; ( books set on matte paper without color? ) \r\n\r\nMy
  flatpmate, Julia here at Reading showed me this: \r\nhttp://www.museum-der-arbeit.de/Service/Schrift+Typografie/\r\n\r\n...but
  this is just for one publisher if I understand correctly.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering
  what else the collective brain here may have run across before or simply knows.

  body: "The <cite>AAUP Book, Jacket and Journal Show</cite> indexes several things,
    including typefaces used. For the books & jackets selected in the 2007 show, there
    were 95 faces used. For the selections in the 1992 show, there were 19 faces used.\r\n\r\nThe
    index doesn't sort between text and display fonts, or fonts used only on the jacket.
    As a rough guess, there were 25 different fonts used for text in 2007, 15 in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn
    2007, for (maybe) text, Arnhem had 3, Bembo 4, Caslon 4, Electra 3, Fournier 3,
    Garamond 7, Minion 6, New Baskerville 5, and Scala 8. The rest were one or two
    instance. Fonts that had 2 uses add Schoolbook, and Trinite. See the comment below
    about jackets.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 for text, Bembo 6, Galliard 5, Joanna 3, and Sabon
    11. Fonts that had two uses, Aldus, Baskerville, Bodoni, Garamond No. 3, and Palatino.\r\n\r\nAbout
    50 books were selected in 1992 and 51 in 2007. However, the numbers of fonts selected
    does include the jackets only category, and obviously, text fonts also appear
    on jackets. As an observation, there is less tendency to use the font \"of the
    book\" on the jacket in 2007 than there was in 1992, and that skews the data.\r\n\r\nThe
    perception that the Association of American University Presses show includes only
    scholarly monographs would be wrong. Only about 25% fit that category. \r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "The AAUP show is one interesting cross-section, as would be the AIGA 50 (which
    Linotype used to tout in their marketing in the 1940s & 50s). But these are winning
    book designs from a large pool of submissions, and I don't think the type choices
    in the winners is necessarily representative of the majority. (I say this as one
    of the judges of last year's AAUP show).\r\n\r\nAnd Nick is right: anything we
    come up with here is likely to be highly anecdotal and not necessarily any accurate
    representation.\r\n\r\nThat said, several years ago, in preparation for a talk
    I gave to the Vermont Book Publishers Association, I did an informal survey by
    going to my local library and poring over the two stacks of new fiction and nonfiction
    titles and tallying the text typefaces. I thought that would constitute a good
    random sampling. (Not everything newly acquired at my library is necessarily newly
    published.)\r\n\r\nThe sample was 313 books. There were 56 different typefaces
    (and I think there were only one or two that I wasn't able to identify without
    later checking a resource). Half of these appeared in only 1 or 2 books. Here
    is the list of typefaces that appeared in 10 or more books:\r\n\r\n34 Sabon\r\n28
    Bembo\r\n27 Times New Roman\r\n18 Adobe Garamond\r\n16 Baskerville [I didn't distinguish
    which source(s)]\r\n15 Minion\r\n15 Janson\r\n12 Garamond (Jannon) [probably a
    combination of Mono & Lino No. 3; I don't think I was distinguishing between them]\r\n10
    Fournier\r\n10 Centaur\r\n\r\nThis was probably 2002 or 2003. \r\n\r\nIf I were
    to do this exercise again now, I would expect Minion to rise slightly, AGaramond
    to drop slightly perhaps, Fournier might rise slightly, Janson would probably
    drop off this top, and Centaur might drop off also. Trends come and go. But I
    would not be surprised if the top three did not change.\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n\r\n--

    They are printing and binding books for many publishers, so the results are not
    skewed by any individual publishers' taste in text typefaces. Still it's only
    a small part of what's out there."

    a good relationship between the fonts they select & what the design books before

    not sure why you want to use units sold as a basis instead of titles. Finding
    that information would indeed be tedious.\r\n\r\nYou could always take NY Times
    Best Sellers lists over a period of several months, hop down to your local bookseller
    and note all the text types, then do some kind of scoring based on list rankings
    (as a way of accounting for relative units sold, perhaps).\r\n\r\nBut I'm not
    sure anything meaningful whatsoever could be deduced from that sort of ranking.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Eben: For an historical perspective (or maybe just a long-term recency illusion),
    see if you can find a good archive of the old \"Monotype Recorder,\" the house
    publication of Monotype. They used to run an annual tally of faces used in Britain.
    I think this was, as the AAUP show Charles & Kent mentioned, based on a design
    competition. I'm speaking here of the 1950s and 1960s, so hot-metal. I'm not sure
    how long it was published.\r\n\r\nThe 1979 and 1983 AAUP catalogs (the earliest
    ones I have here at work) do not have typeface use indexed. By 1987 the type index
    was included. & in 1987 there's a face called \"Meleor.\" \r\n\r\nI'd be willing
    to photocopy the face indexes from the 17 AAUP catalogs I have (if you give me
    some time and a mail address).\r\n\r\nAlso historically you could look at the
    AIGA 50 Books of the Year catalogs (for some time this showing was separate from
    the regular AIGA design competition). I don't know if they had tallies, but in
    most years the faces are listed with the showing of each book.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "For what it's worth, when I was discussing the development of Adobe Jenson
    with Fred Brady, sometime around 1995, he said that one of the main reasons Adobe
    was doing the typeface was because of the large amounts of prize-winning books
    done in Centaur. (some book design prize or another, forget which one)\r\n\r\nI
    then asked him how many copies of Jenson Adobe expected to sell. 10,000? 20,000?\r\n\r\nHe
    said, 'We'd be very happy to sell a thousand.'\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most depressing
    days of my life!\r\n\r\n(Also for what it's worth, when I did a short piece, brilliantly
    illustrated by Jeff Level, on Monotype Centaur, after it first came out in PS,
    for the Ziff magazine PC Sources, it sold 200 copies for Monotype. I thought that
    was nothing, but Monotype was ecstatic -- they'd never sold so many copies of
    a retail PC font before. Alas, that's not a feat that can be repeated anymore!)
    \r\n\r\n(Straying a little further: around 1996, I or my editor at DTPJ, Linda
    Lee, had heard that Adobe was on the point of axing the entire type department.
    It's difficult to imagine today, when we have so many more designers and foundries,
    what a blow that would have been. So we cooked up the idea of giving an extravagant
    four pages over to the the new Jenson, on the theory that the type department
    needed all the good press it could get. I didn't like Jenson, and didn't entirely
    conceal that, but managed to say a great number of extremely nice things about
    Adobe type. Whether it made any difference to the fate of the type department,
    I can't say. There was a point somewhat later when I heard that Warnock confirmed
    his unqualified support of the type department. Some bean counter or another wanted
    to get rid of it. It certainly wasn't lucky with its managers in those days. Things
    are much better now.)"
