  is the title and body typeface?\r\n\r\nAnd then on their website, http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/home,
  is it the same typeface or another one?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

    a mix of Helvetica/Arial (upper menus and smaller text) and Meta (scrolling graphics)
    on the website. Actually, FF DIN has been used in the headings on the lower part
    of the site. And look at that, there's some Frutiger Condensed, and more, used
    in the scrolling graphics as well!\r\n\r\nIt's a bit all over the shop really."

    don't know if there's a 'Denda' or 'Denda Old' or what the difference(s) might
    be.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
