body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a quick critique on the logo attached if anyone
  fancies leaving a comment or two, that would be great. Its a logo for a University
  post grad society. The colours were set in the brief and can't be changed as they
  have to correlate with the main University logo. The letter shapes are intended
  to resemble ladder shapes, based on the idea of 'climbing the ladder of higher education',
  or something to that effect!  \r\n\r\nAny comments, criticisms or suggestions would
  be greatly received.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    1 x 1 square inch (2.5 square cm) it will be hard to recognize and reproduce.
    As for the typography below the initials, a simple san serif such as a Helvetica
    might work.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\n:tony"

    go.

    \r\n\r\nI quite literally winced and pulled away from the screen. I suspect this
    is not the response you're going for ... man, the font just could NOT be worse.
    Choose something that is the <strong>most opposite that font. </strong> \r\n\r\nA
    quick google search shows the [[http://www2.hud.ac.uk/news/index.php|university
    colors]] are a much darker navy blue and burnt orange. Why not use those actual
    color values rather than these neon versions?\r\n\r\nThe ladder metaphor is cliche,
    but in this example it's too fragile to even execute the metaphor properly. \r\n\r\nBottom
    line? I don't think you need a logo mark -- I'd just focus on a logotype alone.
    It's a lot of words; and with the right type treatment, it can be more than enough
    by itself. \r\n\r\nAK "

    does look more like ... Give this job to someone at the University that knows

    on that front! I'll get working on some redesigns and post them back up on here.

  body: "It might be of value to draw from inspiration gathered from campus architecture
    as well. Letter forms to me are more architechtural than sculptural (depending
    on the typeface I suppose). Anyway, the Huddersfield University logo itself is
    based on a building, so it would be a good place to start.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts
    on the logo as it stands 1) lose the box/stroke around the graphic and tie the
    required colors into the illustration 2) As stated above, you need a different
    typeface preferably the standard for Huddersfield or a clean sans 3) Use the light
    blue/orange as accent colors and the darker blue for the type and better part
    of the image. Orange is my favorite color, but don't kill it."

  body: "Thanks for your advice Nachos. Alongside the original I have started to look
    into the architectural link so will pop some ideas up here as a result. I know
    the original flopped but i've posted a couple of other versions (held under the
    original post just to be difficult!) of the original based on the responses so
    would be great to see what you think now.. Do you think the fragmented ladder
    idea still sucks? Do I go back to the drawing board altogether? I think I may
    know the answer to that one but let me know if its looking better than it was!

    just the \"ladder letters\" to total stranger and having them guess what it's
    for. What do you think they'd say? A child's building toy? A day care? \r\n\r\nStart
    from scratch. Actually, start from scratch with at least five new concept ideas.
    Edit down from there. Getting stuck on one concept can hold you back from the
    necessary creative process.\r\n\r\nOh; and if you eliminate the apostrophe and

    It does not represent a  postgraduate society in a flattering manner. And I agree
    with all of the other people who recommended using a different font. Comic Sans
    is inappropriate for this project and in general looks amateurish. Don''t be discouraged.
    You''ve gotten very good advice from the postings, go back to the drawing board
    - we''re looking forward to the next round of designs.  '
