  typography and can be very particular about designs. I'm very much out of my element
  here. I would like to have his wedding band engraved with a brief inscription, but
  the engravers out there seem to have few typeface options available on their websites;
  many are very script-like, fussy, and florid, rather than clear and elegant.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any experience with this? What typefaces would you suggest? Something
  with serifs? All capital letters, or capitals + small capitals? Would going to someone
  who can do hand (rather than machine) engraving be the best option? What things
  should be avoided?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    few professional quality typefaces to choose from, and I think you can also supply
    your own vector artwork.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
