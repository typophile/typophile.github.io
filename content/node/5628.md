  body: Update... <BR> <BR>Please note that Cocktail Shaker has been <a href="http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5388">discontinued</a>
    on the Chank site. Stuart has kindly slid the face over to Veer as an exclusive
    offering in our <a href="http://www.veer.com/umbrella/">Umbrella</a> collection.
    Watch for it&#39;s re-release in August - now with an OpenType version.
