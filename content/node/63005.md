body: Does anyone know if there is a font that is similar to this type? This type
  has been skewed/altered numerous times to get it to line up on a straight baseline
  in an aid to determining its origin. So, its pretty inconsistent. Thanks for any
  help you can provide.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turtles_Old_Type_Needs_Work_3750.gif]

  body: "The S seems like the obvious feature to look for. I tried looking for a similar
    R and E, because they are key letters in my Serif Guide, and I came up with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/kuzanyan/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D105%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DTURTLES%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%26seed%3D25|Kuzanyan]]
    from ParaType. Oddly, even though it is not an exact match, it also has an S without
    a serif on the lower counter, but not the same shape as the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike
