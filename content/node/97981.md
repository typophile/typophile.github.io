body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nI am sure this is a very small issue but I have no clue how
  to solve this. When I generate an OTF file, the icon of the generated font shows
  the Sigma, Square root and not equal to symbols ( I did not even design these symbols
  yet!) on the icon instead of standard A, b and g.\r\nPFA image to understand what
  I am saying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nCG"

  body: "I am getting closer to solving this for sure. At the moment I have a short
    list of likely culprits. Removing  \u201CMathematical Operators\u201D is not on
    the list because I have a font that has that and it shows letters in the Windows
    icon.\r\n\r\nI have\r\n\r\nBasic Latin\r\nLatin 1 Supplement\r\nLatin Extended
    A\r\nLatin Extended B\r\nSpacing modifier Letters\r\nGreek\r\nLatin Extended additional\r\nGeneral
    Punctuation\r\nCurrency Symbols\r\nLetterlike symbols\r\nMathematical Operators\r\nPrivate
    Use\r\nAlphabetic Presentation forms\r\nGeometric Shapes\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can
    A/B test enough of these to get an answer faster than I can just now. I don't
    think all these are equally likely ( Greek? ...probably not ) but I can not say
    with authority which one makes the difference only that the key check box is probably
    in this set. That is assuming of course that there is only one! You might need
    more than one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    them; generated them with and without that flag set and the thumbnails changed.\r\n\r\n

  body: I have tested fonts with & without Mathematical Operators. It isn't the one.
    One of the ones I listed is the one. I just don't know which one yet. Maybe "Alphabetic
    Presentation forms" or "Letterlike symbols".

  body: "@oldnick you were right. I don't why why it didn't happen the first time.
    But today I incrementally  copied the font info of my current font to a dummy
    font and then I started generating font(from the dummy font) after copying each
    page from my original font font. Guess what? Turing off mathematical operators
    check box cured the issue.\r\nThanks\r\nTypogruffer"
