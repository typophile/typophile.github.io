body: I've received no replies on the What the Font forum, so I've decided to try
  here. This typeface looks very familiar to me, but for the life of me I just cannot
  identify it on my own. Do any of you have any ideas as to what its name is?

  body: I can add that the book also uses various weights of Galliard, Footlight,
    and Goudy Old Style, among a few other fonts I am too lazy to remember at the
    moment. Lol.

    Copperplate Text</a> are roughed up versions of the character. Which, you know,

  body: Thanks for the suggestion, hrant, but Sibyl isn't what I'm looking for. Its
    lowercase "a" is single storey unlike the one in the image I uploaded.
