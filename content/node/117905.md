  designs. I\u2019m looking for typefaces which have an extensive and purposeful meaning
  behind their designs. Sufficient enough to write a thousand words about.\r\n\r\nI
  need six case studies in total, so far I have Times New Roman, Capitolium, Johnston
  and Quantange. All of which I believe have enough existing research and theories
  into why and how they have been designed in the way they were. Ideally I need two
  more. \r\n\r\nI posted a brief similar question to this many months back during
  my initial research phase. I was sent in the direction of Nick Shinn and Jeremy
  Tankard\u2019s work, and FUSE, and they all really helped a lot.\r\n\r\nJust wondering
  if anyone knows any good examples to research? Or if there is any past posts that
  may help?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n"

  body: "Hmm.\r\n\r\nI suspect that one could find \"meaning\" in the designs of,
    for example, Futura, Univers, and Optima, as I believe their creators wrote something
    about their intentions in creating those faces. There is a selection effect here,
    simply because in general the concept of meaning only has a limited applicability.
    (My knowledge is too limited to suggest more contemporary alternatives to you;
    these faces are so classic and well-known they may have already occurred to you.)\r\n\r\nThus,
    it would be more challenging to present the meaning of, say, Century Expanded,
    or Corona, or Goudy Old Style. People should be able to read it easily, it should
    print nicely on a rotary press, it should look nice and recall classic early typefaces
    people liked... that's not much in the way of \"meaning\".\r\n\r\nOr how about
    \"The letters should be the same widths as Helvetica so it can be used for preparing
    stuff to be printed on an HP Laserjet with that face, but it needs to be based
    on some other sans-serif face we can get the rights for cheaply\"... the meaning
    of Arial (\"some other sans-serif face\" being Monotype Grotesque).\r\n\r\nBut
    not all typefaces sink to that level of ideational poverty, fortunately. Peignot,
    a famous playful typeface most popular in its bold weight, sought to challenge
    conventional upper and lower case, so it had more meaning in its intent than just
    looking cute and funny; that's another possibility.\r\n\r\n(While Arial is a classic
    example of a \"meaningless\" typeface, even Comic Sans did have an intent behind
    it with meaning. And Papyrus, another love-to-hate typeface, had its meaning discussed
    back when it made its debut on the pages of the National Geographic. While I find
    Comic Sans to be nearly indefensible - it isn't \"bad\", it just gets used for
    too many things it isn't good for - I tend to defend Papyrus; it's overused simply
    because it fills a niche for which there is currently a desperate need; a typeface
    that is at once \"exotic\" and yet safe and politically correct. That may reflect
    problems in our society, but that's not the fault of the typeface.)"

    having a particular meaning is up for grabs.  It is often used for fashion material
    but that is after the fact.\r\n\r\nFutura is another one that got lots of press."

    there is a tendency to regard simulation typefaces as possibly offensive by today's
    standards, they laughed at me, saying that it was silly to think of simulation
    faces as racist, and therefore no one was doing so, except in my imagination!"

  body: "I suppose this is getting too off-topic, but I personally do think it's silly
    to think of simulation faces as racist. They're cheap tricks and could therefor
    be considered offensive in that regard, but I don't understand what the whole
    Chop Suey controversy is about.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>they laughed at me, saying
    that it was silly to think of simulation faces as racist, and therefore no one
    was doing so, except in my imagination!</blockquote>\r\nI think you were justified
    in describing this issue, as in practice people apparently do think it's racist,
    but I often feel people don't really understand what racism actually is. Besides,
    people often seem to take offense for recreational reasons so I tend not to take
    it too seriously.\r\n\r\nI think in a world without Papyrus and Chop Suey, we
    would have a need for Papyrus and Chop Suey. As such we might reinvent them despite
    being sensitive about political correctness.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you're looking
    for meaning in roman typefaces or in typefaces in general, but I suspect you may
    find some typefaces within the blackletter style which embody meaning."

  body: When you're done with your research, might be interesting to show samples
    of the fonts along with separate summaries of the meanings, and see if ordinary
    folks can match them up.
