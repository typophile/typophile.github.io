  37 (1974), 4-28), he discusses Franziska Baruch's Stam type. He says it was 'unsuitable
  for the printing of a legible page, and therefore restricted from the outset to
  use in captions and formal display matter. The light version of this letter, which
  was cast simultaneously, never took hold, because of the misguided aversion of printers
  to Hebrew light-face letters.' But what is this light-face Stam?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nSpitzer
  does not show it in his article, nor have I seen it in any specimen of Berthold
  (for whom Stam was originally made). Nor is it mentioned in the article on Baruch
  in the <strong>Israel Bibliophiles Newsletter</strong> (Spring 1984). I think he
  must be referring to Baruch's similar but lighter 'Mayer' Hebrew. This was not issued
  simultaneously, but was designed for Leo Ari Mayer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
  and produced by Monotype in 1938. Spitzer himself revived this type under the name
  'Mayer-Baruch' at the Jerusalem Type Foundry in the 1950s. But he didn't call it
  'Stam light'. \r\n\r\nBesides my question above, it is worth mentioning that Mayer's
  dealings with Franziska Baruch and Eric Gill (who designed Gill Hebrew also for
  him) seem to be lost to history. Years ago I wrote to the only contact I had, which
  was Mayer's Museum for Islamic Art in Jerusalem; but they knew nothing about Mayer's
  interest in typography, and even thought I had the wrong Mayer! \r\n\r\nAnd if anyone
  would like to know more about Monotype Mayer, may I here advertise my new book <strong>The
  Hebrew Types of the Jericho Press</strong>? Details at www.jericho-press.com.\r\n\r\nChip

    letters that I would expect that it would only be used for specialized purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I recently encountered the name of Franziska Baruch where she was mentioned as
    the designer of the Schocken typeface; <i>that</i> was eminently suited for text,
    being an improvement on Frank Ruehl."

    body: "Could you please post a sample of the Schocken typeface, and also a source
      that mentions it is a recent design, and how it improves upon the design of
      FrankReuhl, which was created in the very early 20th century in Germany?\r\n\r\nThat
      original design of FrankReuhl was a derivative of the classic Romm design, which
      dominated the entire Jewish printing industry for over 100 years. The Romm design
      was cut in metal at the beginning of the 19th century, and perhaps even earlier.
      Certainly, there is historical evidence that the design precedes Guttenberg,
      and was used in hand written drawings (see Frederick Goudy's book on this),
      like also the face known as Rashi. Often, these two letter forms are simply
      called the Square Letter typeface, and the Round Letter typeface.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
      secular or anti-religious scholarship claims the Romm is actually a much later
      design. This is foolish, because the 20th volume of the Talmud documents the
      Talmud set's history, which contradicts this stupid theory, popular by scholars
      in their own eyes. Look it up; it is called the \u05D0\u05D7\u05E8\u05D9\u05EA
      \u05D3\u05D1\u05E8 - the AfterWord.\r\n\r\nBased upon impressions made by professional
      scribes, I believe FrankReuhl was less an improvement graphically of Romm, buta
      political alternative to that which Romm represented. These professionals argue
      that the letter form design of Romm is easier on the eyes than FrankReuhl, and
      conducive to lengthy dwelling on portions of the text in Jewish books, while
      FrankReuhl is better for texts that are read quickly, like newspapers, cheap
      novels, and the like."

    of Raphael Frank\u2019s typeface symbolically disconnected Hebrew as script from
    the religious tradition and connected it to a universal \u201Cmodernity\u201D.
    For that reason it was embraced by those who at the turn of the century aimed
    at the creation of a secular Jewish culture with modern Hebrew literature, newspapers
    (and finally a nation state).\r\n\r\nI think the tendency in Hebrew type-design
    in the 1920ies that lead to typefaces like Baruch\u2019s \u201CStam\u201D and
    \ \u201CSchocken\u201D is a genuine German phenomena. People like Salman Schocken

    who idealized typefaces from the early era of printing. Art nouveau (\u201CJugendstil\u201D)
    was out of date. \u201CFrank-R\xFChl\u201D was critized as a fashion-font from

    von der Jahrhundertwende bis zum Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkrieges\u201D (Egelsbach:
    H\xE4nsel-Hohenhausen 1994) a short biographic sketch on Franziska Baruch can
    be found. He writes the following [with some additions by myself]:\r\n\r\nFranziska
    Baruch was born in 1901 in Hamburg. She studied graphic art at the School of Applied
    Arts (Staatliche Kunstgewerbeschule) in Berlin and completed her studies as a
    master student. In the 1920s she reached success with designs for porcelain manufacturer
    and an excellent performance for \u201CReichskunstwart\u201D Edwin Redslob [Between
    1920 and 1933 the Reichskunstwart was an  authority responsible for the visual
    representation of the state]. Baruch won also great reputation for her work as
    a set designer in the German Pavillions at the International Press Exhibition
    \u201CPressa\u201D in Cologne in 1928. In 1920 Baruch began to work for Jewish
    publishing houses. At that time she had also for the first time dealt seriously
    with the Hebrew letter. After a long study of ancient Hebrew manuscripts and prints
    as well as practical exercises she was able to design Hebrew letters. In 1921
    she drew the texts of some Hebrew books with woodcuts by Jacob Steinhardt. [In
    1922 she was responsible for the Hebrew titles of the pioneering magazine \u201CRimon-Milgroim\u201D,
    and for other publications of the Berlin based Rimon publishing house].\r\n<a

    1922 she gave Joseph Cherkassy [Tscherkassy], head of the Oriental Department
    of the H. Berthold AG type foundry, her first letters designs, based on a medieval
    Prague Haggadah-Print. These designs were later [some time between 1924 and 1929]
    published by the type foundry under the name \u201CStam\u201D [and some variations
    Baruchs designs as \u201CMagere Stam\u201D, \u201CRambam\u201D and \u201CRachel\u201D].\r\n<a

    width=\"500\" height=\"445\" alt=\"Stam Berthold\"></a>\r\n In 1924 [?] Baruch
    also designed the \u201CMayer-Baruch\u201D-Letter for the Orientalist Prof. Leo
    A. Mayer (1895-1959) and tried her hand at the first draft of a type for the Schocken
    publishing house in Zwickau [finallly published in 1938 as \u201CSchocken-Baruch\u201D].
    In 1933 Baruch migrated to Palestine and practiced different professions for her
    livelihood. She worked in drawing maps, designed stone inscriptions, and also
    sold marzipan chocolates under the name \u201CBaruch confectionery\u201D, which
    she made herself at home. \r\n\r\n[Franziska Baruch is also responsible for a
    numbers of logo designs and the masthead of the daily Haaretz]. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isotype75/8542105989/\"

    on the 6. september 1989 in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nA short article on Baruch (by Gideon
    Stern) can also be found in the Israel Bibliophiles Newsletter Nr. 4 (1984). I
    haven\u2019t seen this one as it can't be found in any european library. The providing

    vs. \u201CRomm Vilna\u201D I suggest another thread as this one is entitled \u201CFranziska
    Baruch and Leo Ari Mayer\u201C. \r\n3. \u201CFrank-R\xFChl\u201D is definitely
    not as pronounced as the typefaces of Peter Behrens and Otto Eckmann but the spirit
    of that age did leave an imprint.\r\n4. \u201Chigh falluting\u201D - if you say
    so.\r\n5. \u201CSchocken-Baruch\u201D was originally developed for an edition
    of Stories of S. Y. Agnon - the first Hebrew publication of the Schocken publishing
    house (founded 1931 in Berlin). I haven\u2019t seen this edition yet For further
    \ information about Salman Schocken see: Anthony David: <em>The Patron: A Life
    of S. Schocken 1877\u20131959</em>. New York, Metropolitan Books, 2003.\r\n6.
    As for the discussion about tradition and modernity. This is not that easy (especially
    as english is not my mother tongue). I know nothing about the discussions within
    the different religious groups but a bit about those within the national camp
    - a group that was highly concerned with the revival (and secularization) of Hebrew
    as a spoken language and script and from this point of view with questions of
    Hebrew typography. (They were rather thinking about literature than pornography
    though). These people made a move away from religion and at the same time aimed
    to find new ways of connecting to Jewish tradition. \u201CRimon-Milgroim\u201D,
    the magazine to which Franziska Baruch contributed her designs can serve as an
    example: It was a Hebrew magazine of arts and letters. The first of its kind.
    It\u2019s the difference between going to a synagogue to pray and writing an article
    about synagogal architecture (as did Rahel Wischnitzer one of the editors of the
    magazine). I\u2019m not suggesting that these two ways of referring to a specific
    tradition are excluding each other per se, but they <em>are</em> different."
