  body: "Thanks! Walsheim it is -- I would have recognized the uppercase \"G\", but
    I couldn't find any examples.\r\n\r\nThis was taken from the Spring 2014 issue
    of re:D, the alumni magazine for Parsons School of Design. The Walsheim headlines
    were found only in the featured article -- the rest of the magazine was in Glypha
    and ITC Franklin Gothic."
