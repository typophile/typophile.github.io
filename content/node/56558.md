  body: Most apps/systems expect to see the missing glyph at id 0. Some also expect
    the space at id 3. Some things do actually use CR and .null but in many cases
    they're just filler so that 'space' ends up at id 3 :-)  Most apps don't actually
    use glyph data stored in CR, but I've seen some that do. I guess this is related
    to the glyph order thread; in this case I would say it's not a bad idea to follow
    the recommendation that Paul pointed out; though it's not hard to find fonts that
    don't follow this recommendation and still function just fine.

  body: "It's worth keeping in mind that those are *recommendations*, not necessarily
    requirements. I'm not sure who or what dreamed up the \"first four glyphs\" thing;
    I remember that making its way into the spec some years back but I also remember
    having made and used many fonts that don't meet that recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe
    OpenType specification is fairly conservative; there are many things in there
    that are well out of date now that Windows 3.1, Mac OS 9, and other systems are
    officially or effectively dead."

  body: "It seems like FontForge isn't even able to generate fonts that comply with
    the first four glyphs recommendation, at least not as far as I've figured it out
    and I could be missing something. It won't even allow me to set the name of uni0000
    to \".null\" and the only encoding that puts \".notdef\" at glyph position 0 is
    Adobe Standard.\r\n\r\nI find I have the most predictable results when I encode
    fonts in Unicode BMP order (which violates said recommendation), but am I setting
    myself up for some kind of trouble I don't know about?"

  body: "<cite>I\u2019ve always assumed that OT fonts work on both Windows and Macintosh
    platforms, as indeed they seem to do. What\u2019s going on?</cite>\r\n\r\nNothing
    special :-)\r\n\r\nBoth 'cmap' and 'name' tables have more than a single data
    entry. To discern between entries, each one is prefixed with salient details.
    Platform is important because the default character maps differ significantly
    between Mac and Windows. Additionally, traditionally, Mac char maps were 8 bits
    -- so for different languages, it had different mappings (entirely similar to
    ye olde DOS/Windows code pages). So a font just has loads of mappings, each one
    prepended with a system and a language code.\r\n\r\nNames is sort of the same
    story. What if you have an accented character in a name string -- say, the designer's
    name? Should you use Mac standard encoding, Windows standard encoding, or Unicode?
    The canonical solution was: put it all in. Even though the 21st century solution
    is to use Unicode for everything, Macs historically expect a Macintosh version.\r\n\r\nI
    deliberately say \"historically\", because I'm pretty much convinced with OSX
    it's no longer an issue. Those in the know may correct and/or amend to this, but
    I think both cmaps and names are chosen purely by 'best fit' (transcending encoding
    and platform), instead of insisting on a Norwegian style name encoded in a Windows
    Norwegian 8 bit code page for a Norwegian OS.\r\n\r\nSo, what's going on? \"Better
    safe than sorry\" applies--as well as \"Standards are good--let's have lots of
    them\". A not-too-bad-coded font may be useable on any modern system (Win XP,
    Vista, OSX, or one of the more advanced linux desktops), but a font with all bells
    and whistles in every table is usable on your old Mac SE."

    a good thing, actually. \".null\" is not a legal glyph name (cannot begin with
    \".\", except for \".notdef\"). uni0000 is fine...maybe try \"null\" if you're
    really bored.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>the only encoding that puts \u201C.notdef\u201D at
    glyph position 0 is Adobe Standard</em>\r\n\r\nAre you sure you're looking at
    glyph order and not character code order when you view the other encodings? That
    seems really odd that it would not let you put .notdef as glyph 0 for other encodings."

    it pretty clear that \".null\" is not a legal name: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyphnamelimits.html
    (see #4, Length and Character Set Limitations on Names).\r\n\r\nBut again, there
    are many, many fonts with glyphs named \".null\" which work just fine in many
    different implementations."

  body: "<strong>cuttlefish</strong>\r\n\r\nIndeed, FontForge doesn't allow to set
    the glyph name to \".null\". I think this might be a bug. However there is no
    reason to do that manually, as FontForge just automatically adds the first 3 glyphs
    (if they are missing) when outputting a TTF font. Of course, one would normally
    design the .notdef glyph manually and allow FontForge to create other two.\r\n\r\nThus
    fonts generated with FontForge perfectly comply the recommendation at this point.
    You can check this by opening a TTF font file you have just generated and switching
    the encoding to \"Glyph Order\".\r\n"
