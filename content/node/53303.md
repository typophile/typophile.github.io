  the mini-flourishes just looking weird when on a squarish face? <a href=\"http://notes.salsen.com/?p=177\">For

    with the mini flourishes. I think the bottom of 'S' needs work. The curve looks
    too flat to my eyes.\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting, challenging project. The curved terminals have charm but are
    a tough fit as you acknowledge. Maybe if the strokes weren't so insistently monoline
    (introducing a slight consistent contrast, or thinning bowl strokes as they intersect
    more dramatically), the thinning flourishes would be a better fit.\r\n\r\nAre
    the flourishes on the figures much more pronounced on purpose? That 9 seems unbalanced,
    and also may be violating the open apertures you talked about on your website.\r\n\r\nI'd
    make the ear of the g more old-fashioned, curved and \"flourished.\""
