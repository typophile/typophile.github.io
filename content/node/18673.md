  body: I think not. key glyphs are the lower and uppercase o (cut details in the
    counter) and the terminals of e and the spur of the b seem somewhat Gill-esque,
    though the rest of the glyphs don't seem to be Gill's style, I would say that
    it is from this period. Also note the peculiar junction on the lowercase k.

  body: Jumped the gun on this one. I'm sure I've spotted this elsewhere, the lc a
    and o is pretty distinctive. I'll keep trying. :^)

    in 1982, and then added the Bold under commission from Oxford University Press
    in 1997.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "In the book 'The Art of Matthew Carter' there is a sample of his version
    of Wolpe's 'Pegasus'. It matches the posted samples exactly. I could scan it and
    post it on a page on my site, if you give me a few minutes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
