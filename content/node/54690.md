  body: "I read it as 'PB'.\r\n\r\nTo me the outside curves look awkward where they
    join the NE and SE corners. Try making the curve extend a little further into
    the straight part, or even eliminating the straight altogether.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

- body: "First, I like any monogram without delicate swirls, and this has some great
    potential.  \r\n\r\nIt feels unbalanced to me. The breaks aren't visually equal,
    and the bottom bowl is kicked out too far? I agree with Lex; the curves seem inexplicably
    chopped off. I say let the curves be full curves or make the \"chop off\" more
    dramatic. "
