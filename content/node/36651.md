    Garamond Premier, Arno, Galliard and Goudy Village. \r\n\r\nThis thread points
    out a weakness in search capabilities at font sites: there seems to be no way
    to search for fonts with special glyphs, like this 'st' ligature. Even when you
    know fonts that have them, it is hard to find a way to display them.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know anything that contradicts these last two statements?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Other typefaces of Goudy's with this ligature (from Bruckner's book on Goudy):
    Bertham, Garamont,  Goudy Antique, Italian Old Style, Kaatskill, Kennerley (pretty
    close, but not identical, I think), Truesdell, University of California (Berkeley)
    Old Style.\r\n\r\nFrom the sample of Lanston Kennerley I see in the old Precision
    Type Guide, it appears the digital version is less like this 'mystery' ligature
    than the metal version of it seemed to be.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    FontShop recently released a Complete View of every font's glyph set. For OpenType
    fonts, there is also a list of features so you can display just the glyphs you're
    interested in.\r\n\r\nHere are discretionary ligatures in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/adobe_caslon_pro_ot/?acs=1&acs_ss=4\">Adobe
