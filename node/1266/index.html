		<div class="commentbody"> Even though the face repeatedly uses some obvious devices it still lacks unity. I think the error lies not in the forms themselves, but in the counterforms they create. For example the negative space around the k has no relationship to anything else. The g has similar problems. The extension on the M also causes some awkwardness. The 5 and the G also demonstrate the same idea. While it is obvious the device used to create them, the resulting counterforms are completely inconsistent with the rest of the face. <BR> <BR>Another note: the tails on the lc letters feel like they are floating. Try decreasing the angle of the slant and lengthening them. </div>
