body: I&#39;m just about to embark on some work in relation to an art exhibition.
  The exhibition is themed around the Robert Burns song &#39;A Slave&#39;s Lament&#39;
  &#40;for anybody who&#39;s interested, the artist, Graham Fagen, has recorded a
  dub version of the song with Adrian Sherwood at On-U Sound studios; the work takes
  the form of a music video which will be &#39;watched&#39; by a group of scupltures&#41;.
  The work explores Scotland&#39;s rather little-known history of involvement in the
  slave trade. <BR> <BR>So, typographically I&#39;m looking for something slightly
  nautical- or 18th C.-looking which avoids pastiche or cliche. I&#39;m envisioning
  a slightly hard-edged script face with a modern feel. First thing that took my eye
  was Psy/Ops&#39; <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_ronsard.html" target="_blank">Ronsard</a>.
  <BR> <BR>The face will probably be used only for the title of the show, which is
  &#39;Clean Hands Pure Heart&#39;. <BR> <BR>Anybody feel like suggesting some alternatives?
  <BR> <BR>R

    italic? <a href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk_sirenne_display.htm"
    target="_blank">MVB Sirenne</a> is very nice.

  body: Dan, that is gorgeous. I&#39;m such a sucker for alternate characters. Kinda
    reminds me of the tame second cousin to Linotype&#39;s Zapfino. <BR> <BR>:^&#41;

  body: Tiffany, Ryuichi Tateno was influenced by Zapf&#39;s work when he worked on
    this project. I&#39;ve heard that Hermann Zapf is a fan of the typeface. <BR>
    <BR>Zapfino&#39;s alternates are way more wicked, though.

  body: I second Tiff&#39;s suggestion of Sirenne. I think it&#39;s ideal for the  <BR>nautical
    subject matter. <BR> <BR>Is it more important that the script be &#34;contemporary&#34;
    or  <BR>&#34;18th-century&#34;? A thread title change might be in order.

  body: Even though this sounds like -- is -- an historical show, the display itself
    sounds very modern. Is it?  <BR> <BR>If it is, I would tend toward the less decorative
    and elegant &#40;?&#41; typefaces. Sloop seems far too elegant and decorative.
    Zanzibar is interesting, but too much of it could leave the viewer not reading
    what is important. Pirouette would still work if the alternates were used strategically
    and sparingly.

    <BR> <BR>Not sure if these fit the bill and I sure as hell don&#39;t know if they
    look 18th Century enough. But looking at Ronsard, I&#39;ve come up with these:
    <BR> <BR>T26&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/opsmarckt/" target="_blank">
    Opsmarckt</a> <BR><a href="http://www.letraslatinas.com/html_tex/lagarto.shtml"
    target="_blank"> Lagarto</a> from Letras Latinas. If you manage to buy this one,
    please lemme know how much it costs. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pixymbols/penman/"

    target="_blank">Penman B</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/polonaise/"
    target="_blank">Polonaise</a> <BR> <BR>Will you also consider something kinda
    distressed like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/allegheny/"
    target="_blank">Allegheny</a> or would that be too hackneyed for the slave theme?
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/platthand/" target="_blank">Platthand</a>
    is nice too, no?'

  body: 'Wow, thanks for all this guys. I thought the thread had been &#39;dingied&#39;
    as we say in Glasgow &#40;rough translation: &#39;ignored&#39;&#41; but obviously
    you were deliberating <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Stephen: I think the contempory feel is more
    important than that the face be specifically 18th C. I guess it&#39;s misleading
    to mention such a specific period in the context of typography. As I&#39;m sure
    you&#39;ve realised, the treatment of the subject matter isn&#39;t drily historical.
    <BR> <BR>To nobody in particular: I guess I&#39;m also not keen on using distressed
    faces in general, and particularly not for this job -- it could all get a bit
    Captain Birdseye. <BR> <BR>To Tiff, re readability: I&#39;m not against people
    having to do a little bit of work to read certain things; in this case, as I wrote,
    I think the face will be used only for the four-word title. It&#39;s for a very
    visually-intelligent niche audience, who will go to the show whether they can
    read the title or not, so to me it&#39;s more important to offer something novel,
    pertinent to the subject matter but taking a new angle on it. A bit of mystery
    is fine. <BR> <BR>Having said all that, David H: Zanzibar is wild. I looked at
    Fountain for this project but somehow managed to miss that face. I just downloaded
    the PDF and had a look at the full character set, and I think it could really
    work. It makes the right kind of visual reference, but feels like it couldn&#39;t
    have been designed anytime but now. Very nice indeed. The slight off-the-wallness
    is a bonus, too. <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;ll get up the courage to post the results
    in Critique ... <BR> <BR>Thanks all of you, <BR> <BR>R'
