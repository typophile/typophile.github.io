  design.\r\nI\u2019m working on a stationery project and in the business card I have
  3 stacked lines (address and phone) and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s o.k to kern
  the 3rd line quite loose in order to match the length of the other two lines. Also,
  my 2nd line is slightly looser than the 1st line. Is this practice acceptable or
  a big \u201Cno-no\u201D in typography ? Thanks very much !\r\n\r\nJen \r\n\r\n\r\nTypeface:

    is barely noticeable when the overall color of the unit is seened. It''s only
    a big nono when the text looks obviously forced. '

  body: What you want to worry about is the horizontal continuity...ie. don't lose
    the horizontal flow that should naturally lead the reader from left to right then
    down a line etc etc. This can happen if you have rivers/puddles, incorrect leading
    or kerning/tracking. Your example which creates a 'block' reads fine.

  body: "it's probably just me but the spacing around the dash on the top line compared
    to the spacing of the numerals looks odd. Likewise the spacing of the post code
    feels a bit strange.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Oh I see, so as long as the text feels like a block (without the rivers)
    I\u2019m fine. But what about consistency, I think that\u2019s what Si is talking
    about; i.e. spacing of phone and the apartment number ? Is this just a personal
    taste ? For the last few days I\u2019ve been looking at a lot stationery from
    a various studios and some designer would kern in a similar way, but others would
    not even touch it (and I\u2019m not taking about excessive kerning here). I know
    it\u2019s a case by case thing, but clearly it seems to me there are different
    schools of doing it ?\r\n\r\nPS\r\nSi, I\u2019m not sure what do you mean about
    the post code. Is there a correct way of spacing a post code ?\r\n"
