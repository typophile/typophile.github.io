body: What are good typefaces for gravestones? <BR> <BR>All things being equal, I
  would have the Johns Stevens Shop in Newport carve me a stone. My question here
  is theoretical, though. If you were looking for a typeface to use on a grave stone,
  which would it be? <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, John Benson hasn&#39;t ever released
  any of his inscriptional typefaces!

    <BR>If I can disentangle the family politics from it, I&#39;ll be doing my grandfather&#39;s
    gravestone some time soon. I&#39;ll offer several possibilities, but Trajan and
    Albertus will be among my top choices. I think my Grandfather would have liked
    Trajan, or some of my own lettering just on principle. <BR> <BR>T

  body: After coming to Germany, I&#39;ve noticed that your &#34;average gravestone&#34;
    here looks very different from those back home in the States. In America now,
    some sort of Times Condensed variant is usally sandblasted into stone, along with
    kitchy decorative elements. Here, Solid pieces of stone are used without much
    ornament, but the letters are cast in metal and attached on top of the stone&#39;s
    surface. When a stone is actually carved, the letters are usually Koch&#39;s Neuland,
    or something similar and expressionistic.

  body: Ireland&#39;s most famous stonecutter Ken Thompson is a great fan of Eric
    Gill and his beautiful lettering is based on Gill&#39;s Perpetua face. I think
    its important to note that we are talking of letters carved in stone where each
    character can vary to improve legibility or to enhance the design and not type
    design where the characters do not vary but must still fit together to compose
    harmonious text. On monuments where a typeface has been used - usually sandblasted
    - the results always -to my eye- look awkward

    and Optima on the Vietnam Veterans&#39; Memorial isn&#39;t too shaby, either.
    I still think that quality can just be a matter of picking the &#34;right&#34;
    typeface. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Yes I know, Miles, content counts, and Gotham IS

  body: 'Hrant: no. The dates &#40;1955 and 1975&#41; were hand carved by John Benson.
    The text is Optima, the font he recommended to Maya Lin; this was not hand carved.
    <BR> <BR>The FDR memorial&#39;s text was designed by Benson. He made a font, and
    then sandblasted all of the letters. It looks very good, even though it isn&#39;t
    hand carved. Benson never released this face. <BR> <BR>His son Nick designed and
    carved the text for the WWII memorial in DC. This was also made via a Johns Stevens
    Shop proprietary font that was sandblasted. <BR> <BR>The reason that John and
    Nick sand blast large amounts of text is that in these cases, it would cost too
    much and take to long to do by hand. Nick spent 11 months working on site at the
    WWII memorial. <BR> <BR>John Benson and the John Stetevens Shop hand carved all
    of the text at the JFK memorial at Arlington, and in  I.M. Pei&#39;s East Wing
    of the National Gallery of Art.'

    <BR> <BR>Then god&#40;s&#41; bless the Ancient Greeks. BTW, do you know why they
    used much smaller letters than the Romans? One reason is that they carved a lot
    more text. They used to engrave some parts of letters with a single strike. Which
    is why &#40;or at least one reason&#41; why their letters were so much more angular.

  body: I don&#39;t think that any type can be used to cut on stone. A proper design
    is requested, not all typefaces are suitable. <BR> <BR>If you know for example
    the British Museum stone cuts, you can see there that the horrible Rotis is again
    used for the stone carving as model. BUT, hopefully, the stone cutter have done
    a very good job and transformed the original Rotis into a workable type for such
    job. <BR> <BR>Also, I don&#39;t see any Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni or a Grotesque
    Sans, cut on stone. Specially not so much lowercases and specially not Italics!  <BR>
    <BR>Humanistic Caps only &#40;or something like Lithos&#41;, a good creative letterform
    design, not specially connected to usual Rome models. Well spaced, with some ligatures
    :-&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m probably to traditionnalist on that area?&#41;
