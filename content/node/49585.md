  body: The versions of the Windows core fonts (Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New,
    and the new Segoe UI) that ship with Vista contain glyphs for all these characters;
    older versions do not.

  body: "On that matter, what WOULD a capital Thorn, Wynn, and Yogh look like in blackletter.
    \ I've not seen an example of either.  I've seen Thorn only in one other black
    letter font, but it was one where the P's bowl was high.  Unfortunately I'm not
    sure if there's a standard way of differentiating P, \u01F7, and \xDE and I'm
    not familiar with good sites to browse for facsimile editions of old English books.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
