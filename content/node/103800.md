    The BQ and BT versions have minor differences.  \r\nThe character widths may have
    been expanded slightly.\r\nYour image shows a font with small caps. Neither the
    BQ or BT Normande has this feature. I suspect the effect was created by the designer
    of \"Horse Event.\" Alternatively someone has created a variation on Normande,
    which is a very old design dating back to about 1860.\r\nDon"
