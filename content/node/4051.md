  body: The sample above is beautiful. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll feel
    the same, but it made me think of Red Rooster&#39;s work. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/poor-richard-rr/poor-richard-rr/testdrive.html?s=319%2BMAIN&amp;p=48">Poor

  body: I thought of that too, Chesh. I think we&#39;re both focusing too  <BR>much
    on that purdy &#39;A&#39; though. It may be broken solely for <BR>practical reasons
    &#40;metal cut&#41;. I think we need to look to the  <BR>numerals. Unfortunately
    figures aren&#39;t part of my photographic  <BR>font memory like alphabetic glyphs
    are.
