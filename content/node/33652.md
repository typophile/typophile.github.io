body: I hope I don't get a bashing for asking this, but what is so freaking great
  about [[Garamond]]? I mean, I know someone who goes to a design school, and they
  literally worship Garamond. I just look at it and go, "Great. That's a nice font."
  Personally, there are so many others I would prefer to use. I didn't go to design
  school so I didn't study all the history of the typeface and the intricacies of
  the typeface's bowl, stem, and whatever. I've read books about the typeface but
  nothing as interesting as they make it out to be.

    it easy on the eyes for reasons that are pretty subjective. There have been a
    lot of technically great font designs that have come and gone over the years because
    people just don\u2019t enjoy looking at them, Garamond is one of the few typefaces
    that just holds up over the centuries."

    hard not to do and if you are not interested in design you may not need to worry.
    But if you are interested in design read on...\r\n\r\nI suggest that you start
    by looking at the range of them ( just what I haven't done yet ) and realize that
    there are many many Garamondes and other related faces that happen not to be named
    Garamond, and that there are plenty of differences. It might take your eye a while
    to find & feell them ( let your mind wander while you do this it might not help
    at first - too imapatient ) but when you do find them - it will may be a delicious
    moment for you. And Typomania may sset in quickly after that. HAHAHAHAHA!\r\n\r\nA
    side note: I have to admit that I don't love to read Garamonds. They seem spindly
    to me alot of the time. And fussy. But I have not compared them all and looked
    at them in a serious way. I have a feeling I would like Slimbach's version on
    account of it feeling a bit more robust... \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't think anyone sees Claude Garamond derivatives as <i>exciting</i>;
    they're just kind of baseline old-styles. Since the mature Garamond's intention
    in his romans was, I think, to produce neutralised, better cut and multi-size
    versions of the De Aetna type - even inheriting over-dark caps from a book for
    which Griffo had only finished his new design's lowercase - that characterisation
    goes right back to the originals. Garamond Premier Pro, at least in the roman,
    therefore seems inherently odd to me - it aims for the authentic character of
    a body of work that was meant to be unsurprising except in the competence of its
    production. In a sense, Sabon Next, with its almost masochistic neutrality, is
    the digital type truest to Garamond's intentions. \r\n\r\nBut then I could be
    entirely wrong about this."

    is very low, much lower than other well designed serif typefaces, making it more
    difficult to read -- not easier. ITC increased the x-height, but not by any great
    leaps. URW redid ITC Garamond and even increased the x-height a hair more... but.\r\n\r\nNow
    Nigella - weren't you part of the bonfire party that burned all your vinyl Beatle

    later, designers like Mike Stromberg and Tony Russo were using Garamond and Cheltenham
    on every masculine book cover you could think of. For a while there - if it wasn't

    mass paperback bookcovers had to offer in the way of type."

    a significant role during immersive reading. The effectiveness of a given x-height
    size depends on the setting size, with something \"bookish\" like a (real) Garmond
    very well suited to around 11 point. Baskerville is even more bookish, being most
    comfortable at around 13 point.\r\n\r\n> ITC increased the x-height, but not by

  body: "Wasn't the amazing thing about Claude's types that they were exquisitely
    cut? Seems to me that no types had been so balanced, nuanced, graceful and even-textured
    before. At the time this would be a major feat since every punch was hand-cut.
    Since we have infinite control over outlines now, this doesn't impress us, and
    we have literally thousands more types to choose from, so the presence of even
    a very true Garamond among them also doesn't impress us. There are so many types
    to choose from, many of them variations on Garamond, that Garamond has become
    a genre itself. The times are very different now. And our idea of what is beautiful
    and even-textured has evolved. For instance, in Garamond's time there weren't
    a slew of humanist sans designs to choose from, or even any sans designs to select
    from.\r\n\r\nReally, Garamond (the genre) is a very sturdy and readable kind of
    type, so it's had longevity. That long life is one reason it's admired. "

    Garamond if I had to but almost on every time I would also prefer an alternative
    face because it's a bit dull and so overused.\r\n\r\nToday there are plenty of
    equally good and also better text faces. Many of them will suit better than Garamond
    on a given project because of their character, texture, rythm, features, etc...

    to sound like forelock pulling... but I am pretty sure it's true so I will say
    it anyway. I think would rather read a novel set in Beorcana than any Garamond
    I know of. Partly this is because the gramonds I know are digital and probably
    'lesser' in a variety of ways. Partly this is because Beorcana has optical weights
    available which is no small advantage. And also it's true that the relationships
    of ascender & x height are more to my liking and probably more fashionable too.
    But finally, at least to me, it's just a better and more humane face. Put another
    way; when I am reading Garamonds I find my eye is just less accomodated than it
    is with Beorcana. Beorcana feel natural in a way that Garamonds can't match. And
    I don't think it's merely fondness etc. I think it's a case of being less visible
    as 'type' and thus doing the job better.\r\n\r\nJust in case anyone wants a gander
    ( Carl doesn't need to look I would bet... ) :\r\n\r\nhttp://www.beorcana.com/specs3.html\r\n\r\nObviously
    there are more reasons than sheer utility to consider. 'Voice' or style etc is
