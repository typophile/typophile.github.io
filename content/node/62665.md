  font with a similar O but heavier weight. The kolo wide is too thin but I like the
  size and shape of the O. Also, The font you suggest -- i need it to be a San Serif.
  \r\n\r\nI searched the fonts on my system wasn't able to find a similar O. \r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, tips, direction appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nambrin"

    reminded me of Gill Sans. \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"
