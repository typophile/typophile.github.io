  Type Foundry.\r\nhttp://www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenArtifex.pdf\r\nArtifex is
  cool (and maybe would match on a \"fashion\"-project which is in the pipeline),
  but it is missing lining figures and has only one style (regular), no italics*,
  no thicker weights.\r\nCan you suggest me s.th. similar? Keywords: Deco, hybrid,
  playful, sharp, \"feminine\", but not totally \"over the top\"\u2026\r\n\r\n*this
  is not so important"

  body: Artifex is fabulous and fortunately there's nothing like it. I'll post something
    soon though that may fit your criteria...
