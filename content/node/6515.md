  body: You know what. Do you have a text file with all of the characters you&#39;d
    like to see? It is OT &#40;opentype&#41; and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll miss some characters.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, all I can give you is a GIF. I&#39;m pretty sure a entire sampling of
    their character set conflicts with their EULA in some way.
