body: "I've started working on a videogame a while back & since it's both inspired
  & limited by 8-bit standards (I looked up the size & colour limitations of NES-games)
  I had to make an 8x8 font to fit the 'tiles' (static 'building blocks' for backgrounds
  & such) & 'sprites' (animations) I've made so far.\r\nAt first I made a simple monotype
  (due to the size restrictions) serif font of which I made several variations, but
  soon one of them became more & more script-like. Once I finished the entire scriptfont
  & noticed how 'sweet' it looked I thought it'd be cool to add contrast by making
  a surly font to go with it so that I could use the sweet font for the good guys
  & the surly one for the villains.\r\nI'm quite happy with the outcome, especially
  since the 8x8 size (which already includes the kerning) was quite a challenge to
  add character to each font.\r\nThe x-height for both fonts was 6 giving me 1 extra
  pixel for both ascenders & descenders. Not a lot, but I hope I still managed to
  keep it legible. Given that the total height comes to the full 8 pixels of the 'tiles',
  I'll be forced to include a 'blank' row between every line if I don't want things
  to get messy.\r\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with the result & I'd love to hear
  your thoughts on it. Especially on the 2 @'s for the good font (which one do you
  prefer?) & some tips on how to improve the 0 from the same font.\r\nThanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Good-vs-Evil_6706.gif]"

  body: "Great work!. I can\u2019t wait to see how it develops. I recommend changing
    the title of this thread to \u201CGood vs. Evil -- two 8-bit style pixelfonts\u201D
    as at a glance I kept seeing \u201C28.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs far as the @ goes, can
    you post an enlarged image of them? I think 500 px wide is the max to avoid a
    horizontal scroll.\r\n\r\nWhen I set an @, I often baseline shift it down so the
    bottom of the a inside the circle rests on the baseline, as opposed to the outside
    of the circle. This essentially makes the bottom half of the circle a descender
    (see below). Perhaps exploring this may open up a few options.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/at_6673.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile
    I seldom evaluate things on an aesthetic level, gut reaction prefers the first
    one, but upon closer inspection I begin to see a backwards s (and then the beginning
    of a backwards swastika). My preference then shifts to the 2nd one. Perhaps the
    2nd one with the circle continuing around and falling below the baseline?\r\n\r\nAnd,
    given that there are good guys and bad guys, what\u2019s to stop them from having
    their own @ characters?"

  body: "Thanks for the tip, I already changed the title of the thread ;-)\r\nI usually
    try to center my @-sign with the x-height, but due to the single pixels for descenders
    & ascenders that only allowed me to align the a with the baseline in the first
    one. I've also included an enlarged image of the 'bad' @ since it probably isn't
    very clear at the original size.\r\nFor both fonts I attempted to give the symbols
    (@,*, &,...) the same feel as the font it belonged to & for both @-signs I started
    by making a smaller version of the a. Size limitations however kept me from making
    a full circle though. To keep in line with that I treated the \xA9 the same way
    extending the c's lower curve into an open circle.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/At_4592.gif]"

    do you plan on displaying the font?

  body: "The resolution for NES-games was 256x240 although for NTSC the top & bottom
    screenlines were often omitted leaving you with a resolution of 256x224 which
    is the one I want to use. I intend to use the fonts at 100% (original image),
    but since it turned out bigger than expected when put together with the sprites
    & tiles I've got so far I'll probably be forced to use cut scenes for the dialogues.
    I do plan on scaling the end result to 200% to fit the screen better & to give
    it that retro jagged look ;-)\r\nI might still try to make a 4px wide font to
    use 'in' the game.\r\nI'll try & post some pictures of fonts + tiles/sprites for
    size comparison later.\r\nAny more thoughts on the @'s or suggestions on how to
    improve the 'good' zero?"

    probably be best for just titles or cutscene dialogues.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_5086.gif]\r\n*I
    actually made an swf-file so you could see the animations as well, but apparantly
