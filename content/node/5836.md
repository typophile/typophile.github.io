  body: Paul, <BR>I just put up a pdf of 3 pages from my book Dutch Type. <BR>It will
    tell you more about the context, as well as Van der Leck&#39;s later lettering.
    The famous Batavierlijn poster with its Art Deco typography is an early work and

    in the chapter on VdLeck, The Foundry in London digitzed his later elemental alphabet.  <BR>
