body: "I am setting a large list consisting of city names and addresses (for a magazine
  ad). Some cities have up to 4 addresses, some have just one address. Everything
  should be centered (! not my \"idea\"), and when it is - there is just this whole
  list of addresses and no place for the product at all. Pretty bad, taking into consideration
  it is a product in a luxury segment of goods.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking, maybe there
  is a way it can be centered but separated somehow different? A middle dot is the
  only thing which comes into my mind. What else would you use?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"

    ornate line.  \r\nOf course space can be used. \r\nOr you could alternate styles
    to separate them (bold/light, roman/italic.\r\nColor can be used too. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n "

  body: Can you choose any fonts?  I suggest convincing the client to set up the list
    as one paragraph using a script font like Kuensler two bold for the name of the
    City and Centaur for the address info.The script font will serve as an obvious
    indication that a new name&info is beginning. These two fonts look classy when
    used together. Plus the main focus is the product and not 3/4 of a page used up
    by space for lines and lines of typed addresses.

    separator suggestions from others."

  body: "I cannot really choose a font. Arial (kill me, but that's what the design
    guideline says - when using a non-latin language) and, as a possibility, Engravers'
    Gothic. I could use EG for city names and Arial bold and regular for store names
    and addresses. The list still eats up a lot of page space. My suggestion was to
    leave the city names, or - if that is too little - city name and a store name,
    without all the details... We'll see if the idea comes through.\r\n\r\nMiddle
    dots and bullets could work fine together."

  body: I've used 3 spaces or 4 spaces for separation. A lack of type can give the
    reader a sense of pause and/or separation
