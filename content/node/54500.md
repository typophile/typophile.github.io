  some interesting found type in Chicago.  In any case, I was curious if anyone knew
  what [[http://www.chicagotype.com/images/wave6/G_and_O_1.jpg|face]] this was?

  body: I don't think that's available in digital form, but <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eagle">Eagle</a>
    and <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html">Mostra</a> are very
    much in the same Art Deco vein. The ampersand in Mostra, in particular, is very
    close to your sample.

  body: I'd imagine whoever designed it, whether architect or signmaker, was referencing
    Futura for the "Thermal Supply Honeywell Controls".

    around here on the signage of some buildings here.\r\n\r\nHere's a picture I took
    when I found a sample at RIT. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/0313081710a_4869.jpg]"
