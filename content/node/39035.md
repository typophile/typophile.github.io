  if someone could take a look at these three words and tell me where I'm going wrong
  with the kerning? \r\nSeems so simple, but between the upright L and the angled
  A and the rounded C and the upright K, etc etc- it's driving me bananas!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackdot_6557.png]"

    LA pair is a challenge, but I think you've been staring at it too long. ;^)\r\n\r\nTry
    looking at it upside down. I think the BLA and CK work. Maybe the AC is a little
    loose. OT looks a little loose too. FURNITURE is all over the place. That's why
    I think you need to take a break. ;^)"

  body: A huge improvement- thank you, Jupiterboy. I kept getting bogged down with
    pairs, and not looking at the whole line.
