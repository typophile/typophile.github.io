    post from John Hudson]] indicates that it should be possible to run VOLT in a
    Windows 7 environment.

  body: Since John is here I  want to ask which is better, VOLT or AFDKO for Hebrew
    font development. I am a complete noob, BTW. and also apart from the one hour
    video available in the VOLT website and the VOLT manual, is there any other way
    i can learn VOLT?

  body: I only use VOLT for OpenType development. My understanding is that you should
    be able to do everything necessary in AFDKO 2.0, but I've never tried it. I've
    been using VOLT since it first came out, and my workflow is very VOLT-centric.

    said that it couldn't install because some of my 'system files' were out of date.
    It offered to update them, but I balked, since all MS updates were installed.
    \r\n\r\nUPDATE: I bit the bullet and let it install what it thought were more
    up-to-date system files. No ill effects have been noted.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    new Dynamic Link Libraries omit older dependencies, presumably on the assumption
    that newer programs all use newer DLLs. If VOLT needs a previous version to work,
    then you probably got less up-to-date files.\r\n\r\nAnd, Typogruffer: the fact
    that you are a noob is apparent with both your choice of handles and every question
    that you post here. Sometimes, folks are surprised by the many and varied answers

    am not sure what you meant by this but if you are talking about my avatar(bezier
    handles), in my defense i drew it in Photoshop with a mouse.\r\nAnd coming to
    the noob questions, I decided to tone them down and post only when it is absolutely
    necessary. By not doing my own research, I am missing a lot of knowledge that
    can be gained very easily. Unless I have something which can not be solved easily,
    I wont post it here.\r\nThanks oldnick and the whole Typophile family for patiently
    helping me with my queries. If I ever make it big, I owe everything to this forum.\r\n"

  body: "@Typogruffer\u2014\r\n\r\nAllow me to elucidate. I presume that you are young
    (under twenty-five). From what I observe, your generation has been fed the notion
    that acquiring professional tools automatically makes you a professional: sadly,
    this is not often the case. To my mind, there are no substitutes for a firm technical
    foundation and thoughtful mentoring. Before I turned pro around 2001, I had: over
    forty years of experience operation dedicated typesetting machines; almost as
    many years dealing with computers; advanced drafting skills with ruling pen an
    compass; about sixteen combined years, working in actual print shops; and, the
    ten previous years, wrangling bezier curves.\r\n\r\nPrompted by a certain <em>je
    ne sais quoi</em>, Ilene Strizver ( http://thetypestudio.com/ ) took me under
    her wing and, together, we developed the ITC and Monotype exclusives in my <em>oeuvre</em>.
    I was only after learning a deeper level of craft from Ms Strizver that I had
    the confidence to strike out on my own. So, the whole process is a little more
    complicated than opening the box and becoming an instant star.\r\n\r\nHow had
    can it be? Very: as formats evolve, continuing education becomes critical. Thanks
    to the generosity of many folks in this forum, I have been able to keep up with
    the most important developments, and keep my product line more or less state-of-the-art.
    I do not wish to appear to deny you the same access to the collected wisdom which
    may be found herein; I merely wish to point out that it can be very hard, professional
    tools notwithstanding\u2026"
