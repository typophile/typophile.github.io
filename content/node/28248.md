    for a display version. a text version might might ask for less contrast.

  body: "Chris, I personally don't think it's a matter of display vs text, but what
    your suits your design best. \r\n\r\nI just checked the print-out, and in the
    smaller size the higher contrast is not as noticeable. But I think this is because
    of the toner spread, which has percentage wise more of an effect in small size.
    \r\n\r\nI think you might look at the contrasts in Souvenir, and how that has
    been handled. Your Froggy is a crisper version of the kind of thing that Souvenir
    and Cooper Black do. \r\n\r\nI read in Mac McGrew's book that Benton drew only
    the medium weight, and Benguiat added the light and popular heavy weights. I don't
    find the light weight of Souvenir very satisfactory, but the medium and heavy
    are very good. \r\n\r\nOn the joins vs other parts, as you know from my TypeCon
    talk about my Caslon revival, I think that the joins have a different visual logic
    than other parts, and one can thin the joins more than the rest, as Unger has
    done in his faces. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, your o is better. But I think also the joins
    need to get fatter, quicker longer coming out of the stems if that makes sense.
    That is if you want a very thin join. Also where the thin line coming into the
    thick line has more space, as in the e, it needs to be more like the top of the
    o and e, I think. You will need to proof this actually on a high resolution image-setter
    to get an accurate concept of the effect in small sizes.   \r\n\r\nSomehow I feel
    that because your design is quite wide, and the joins are relatively low, you
    don't really need a sharp join. The top of the mnr will still look clearly separate--particularly
    with your semi-serif action. \r\n\r\nAlso I suspect that a light weight just won't
    work, as Benguiat's light Souvenir flops, where his heavy is a big winner. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I know some people hate Souvenir, but they are wrong. My local library
    uses it on all signs, and it works great. It projects a friendly, welcoming image,
    while being very readable and disciplined. Your version is more hip and more crisp,
    but in the same space emotionally, with its warmth and touch of informality. \r\n\r\n "

    noted, more pointed joins (which is what you will get) may conflict with Chris's
    wonderful design, as it exists in the thicker weight. The medium may work fine
    with a more uniform branch, so the branch doesn't come to a 'point' when it joins
    the stem. This is the way Souvenir medium is--not pointed. \r\n\r\nOh, here's

    I think you were right to add more contrast back. I suspect Andre is right about
    about the g--good catch. I can see what is really tricky here is that changing
    the weight changes the counters and/or the outside, and you can't preserve both.
    So you have the challenge of figuring out what will preserve the look, or work
