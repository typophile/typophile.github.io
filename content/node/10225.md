body: 'Hello people, <BR>these are roughs for a poster about a play in theater called
  &#34;the child&#34;, written by the Norwegian Jon Fose &#40;propably this is not
  the correct spelling but I have his name only in greek&#41;. <BR> <BR>The play starts
  at a bus station where some people are waiting, including a man and a woman who
  like each other. The next scenes are showing the life of the couple, where the distance
  between them is growing more and more. <BR> <BR>The subjects that the play is touching,
  are the gap between people, the emptyness of the relations, the luck of communication
  and the unspoken words as the unborn child of the couple.  <BR> <BR>The writer himself
  says that the most important of his plays, is the pause... <BR> <BR>So, there are
  the solutions I gave for the moment, and I am expecting your views. <BR> <BR>Fonts

  body: I like the top one, except that the torn part being rough might give misleading
    information. Try making it like an earthquake crack. I think the &#34;X&#34; on
    the uterus doesn&#39;t work, and neither does the red foetus. But I like the author&#39;s
    name in the crack. <BR> <BR>Nice work! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: So, these are the proposals i will send to the cliend. I thought about the
    earthquake Hrant, but it seems to me it won&#39;t help since earthquake includes
    the element of trembling, opposite to the stillness of the play. As for the &#34;x&#34;
    i disagree because i think is suitable to symbolize the canceled process of pregnacy,
    plus is a strong mark and i need something strong in that part of the poster.
    <BR> <BR>Colin I tried the xeroxing first thing in the morning and i end up with
    the lettering in the 2nd poster. Though i am not sure for the lettering  result
    &#40;maybe they look like lettering for a horror movie&#41;, this is the poster
    i believe in. It will be pitty if the clients will insist to put color &#40;i
    am sure they will ask&#41;. In that case i would rather chose the 3d poster. <BR>
    <BR>Thank you all for your advises. Of course the work didn&#39;t finish so i
    would be happy with more comments <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6971.jpg"

  body: 'incredibly anal nitpik: The &#39;X&#39; seems to be closer to her stomach
    than her uterous. <BR> <BR>I think Hrant&#39;s comment regarding the earthquake
    wan&#39;t meant to be literal. I think it had to wo with the rough line turning
    into a clean line at the umbilical cord. I think the way you have it works great
    on the second poster, but the differing line qualities are a bit too much on the
    first poster when you add in all of the other elements. <BR> <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>The &#39;X&#39; being a bit high was me being just really really picky.
    That said, the more I think about it, a woman would certainly associate that more
    with her stomach than her uterous, so perhaps it&#39;s less pickey than I thought.
