  based on the 'Hand Written Letter', a section focuses on letters sent from the Prime
  Ministers office. \r\n\r\nCan anyone identify these two typefaces they seem pretty
  common I just can't figure out what they are. \r\n\r\nNo.1:\r\nhttp://www.mattwardman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/q-logo-10-downing-street-website-1.gif\r\n\r\nNo.2:

  points if anyone could even point me in the direction of somewhere I can get my
  hands on a high-res or vector version of the Downing Street crest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys,\r\n\r\nOwen\r\n\r\n\r\n"
