body: I could use some help in choosing fonts to work with P22&#39;s Stanyan.  I will
  use them for our company&#39;s total presentation, both on print and web.  I&#39;m
  using Stanyan for our name.  I have a very temporary website up &#40;I did it in
  30 minutes&#41; and I have to get something permanent in place as the current one
  isn&#39;t even accurate. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    In fact the numerals in Stanyan seem to be derived directly from ATF Garamond,
    with the idiosyncratic slight vertical extensions. <BR> <BR>A much more interesting
    choice however would be a Fleischman, like the fresh-off-the-grill Farnham: <BR><a
