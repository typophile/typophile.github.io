  manufacturer recommends only \u2018genuine\u2019 Samsung toner products. \r\n\r\nIs
  this a bunch of baloney? Or should I pony up for the more expensive stuff?\r\n\r\nPlease
  relate any info/stories.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "We at the office always used the cheap re-fills, right up and until we had
    to call in a mechanic, 'cause it seemed the drum had gotten bad (something like
    that).\r\n\r\nThat didn't take him too long: \"Hellohellohello, wha've got 'ere
    then?\" He replaced the drum and told us it was our own fault for not using brand
    cartridges.\r\n\r\n... So we bought one, to insert the next time the machine breaks
    down. My personal bet is it'll be the electric supply then: \"Been feedin' unbranded
    'lectricity, have we?\""

  body: I've had bad luck using "cheap" off-brand toner in my Samsung. Although I
    dislike paying more for the reals Samsung cartridges, I've never had a problem
    with them.

    as well as ones at various jobs, and never had any problems.

    will refill yours. I have been using the same company for 18 years. I trust them
    and I always keep a backup at the ready. I have had HP and NewGen printers. At
    one point the cartridges for the NewGen were $289 so I was judicious with what
    I printed especially when it came to 11 x 17's.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    to my house. Its cheaper than having it over nighted too. Its off-brand but we\u2019ll
    see if its any good.\r\n\r\nSimon>>> Thank you that link. My printer is printing
    light. Fixyourprinter.com suggested I should wipe the laser beam unit down. Uhhhh...
    where the heck is that at?\r\n\r\nHopefully this new toner cartridge with print
    miraculously better. Light printing and all, it\u2019s much better than an inkjet
    printer!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll report back shortly.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    \r\n\r\nHIGH FIVES TO MICHAEL!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nThe man that sold me the laser
    toner asked me what I do for a living and told him I\u2019m a font nerd and a
    (kinda-sorta) graphic designer. \r\n\r\nHe commissioned me to design him business
    cards.\r\n\r\nMy \u201Cclient\u201D loves his existing horrible logo set in Times
    Roman with a swoosh around it. I told him why the format needs tweaking, and the
    type is low-rent. \r\n\r\nI said \u201CIf you went to a fashion show, would you
    wear Wal-Mart? Likewise, if you want your card to say your a professional you
    need your card set professionally using appropriate typography.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
    should have gotten slapped for that, but nonetheless it came from a good place.\r\n\r\nNow
    for the hard part: DELIVERING!\r\n\r\nTrust me I\u2019ll be relying on my fellow
    Typophilers to help me through. And of course I have no budget for new type.\r\n\r\nHe
    wants one of those business cards with everything on it. Logo, everything (and
    I mean everything) he sells, and the usual contact information. A two-sided job
    for-sures. \r\n\r\nI told him my main rule: no patriotic colors!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I\u2019m going to dinner and to see the new \u201Cviolent\u201D James Bond flick,
    will post more soon.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n"

    DataBszaar.com and have bought about 100 of them. Instead of paying $195 I pay
    $39 and eliminate the shipping and sales tax charges. The toner powder is the
    same but you might get a refurbished\r\ncartridge made in China of course."
