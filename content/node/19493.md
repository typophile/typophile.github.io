body: Congratulations to [[Miguel Sousa]] for the recent appointment to the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/01/job_opening_fon.html">
  font devewlopment position</a> at [[Adobe]]. It couldn't have happened to a better
  candidate, IMO. Miguel is one of the most knowledgeable and helpful contributers
  here at typophile, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who appreciates that. I figured
  since he's now in [[San Jose]], it's safe to break the news. Let's get a big round
  of applause, everyone!
