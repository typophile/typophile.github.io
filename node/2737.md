  body: I can&#39;t help you with the French part, although I&#39;m sure some here
    can do that too. As for the Mac-only format, it might be time for you to look
    into font conversion tools. I know FontLab has <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/transtype.html"
    target="_blank">TransType</a>, and I believe there are other tools around, possibly
    even shareware/freeware. &#40;I use Fontographer to convert PC to Mac when needed,
    but that&#39;s a different investment.&#41;

  body: 'By the way, I happened across a similar-looking font yesterday in the Indie
    Fonts 2 book: <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=265" target="_blank">Identikal&#39;s
    Angol</a>. It doesn&#39;t have the mix of angular &amp; normal letters that Labomatik
    has, or the ink-trap design detail &#40;as far as I can see in the samples&#41;,
    but it is quite similar in concept, to my eyes.'

    mine and will be glad to respond to your answer.
