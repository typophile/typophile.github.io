    events in species decimation occurred in the late 19th century at Stephen Island,
    an atoll off the coast of New Zealand. A single cat brought into the island by
    the lone lighthouse keeper killed the entire species of a native rare flightless
    bird, now known as the Stephen Island Wren (Diamond, 1984). This could well be
    the only documented elimination of an entire species by a single animal predator,
    but this surely highlights the grave danger faced by native animals in any habitat
    in the face of alien animal introductions.</em>\r\nTim"
