body: I am looking for a font similar to Bello SC (specifically SC) that is free or
  cheap, like $10-$20. I am writing a tutorial that utilizes Bello and I want my readers
  to be able to replicate the effect without shelling out $55

  body: Is there really that big of a difference between $20 and $55? Are you writing
    for low-income designers?

  body: I'm writing for beginners with little to no Photoshop experience, who do this
    as a hobby. Not everybody has $50 to spare on some tutorial they see (including
    me). I want it to be more accessible to people, so a freeware font would be nice.

  body: "The effect? Not really understanding what you want in regards to Bello. I
    suppose Arial is to Helvetica in what i understand you're sort of wanting, but
    Bello is pretty unique and finding some random typeface online is unlikely.\r\n\r\n<strong>Edited</strong>\r\n\r\nAre
    you creating a illustration comp using Photoshop? Feel is one thing, but the user
    could use any typeface to at least try the techniques out.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Too late now, I guess, but check out <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/talking-five/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Talking Five Heavy</a>. A very nice font for $12.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    while it's a bit lighter, lots of Windows users have Maiandra Demi Bold because
    it is bundled with <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1004\"
    target=\"_blank\">various MS products</a>."
