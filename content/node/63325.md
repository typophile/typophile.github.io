    tho, makes the type hard to read. And I think you could use a little more black
    space on the left hand side of the block to balance it a bit.\r\n\r\nliking it\r\n"

  body: "In that case the logo matches the intention, but the viewer is left wandering
    where the T comes from. Is it the first T in \"intelligent\"? Should the treatment
    of the words single out the T somehow too, if that's part of the identity?\r\n\r\n(Also,
    the logo needs to be moved right if it is intended to be optically centered in
    the box. Or the left placement should be more emphatic if it's not.)"

- body: "The name itself makes little sense. It sounds as if it was translated poorly.
    'Remove' is a verb, and it can't be modified by an adjective (intelligent.) The
    parts of speech just don't fit; and this flagrant ignorance instantly reduces
    trust in the brand. \r\n\r\nTo make sense in English, it needs to be \"Intelligently
    Remove\" (adverb, verb) or \"Intelligent Removal\" (adjective, noun.)\r\n\r\nIf
    this was my client, this would be the first conversation I'd have with them before
    any logo development. Chances are, this company will eventually be forced to undergo
    a name change; better sooner than later.\r\n\r\nOh, and I'm sure they'll have
    \"reasons\" for twisting English, but no reason is a valid argument for choosing
    to introduce oneself so poorly."

  body: Alaskan, the name is OK. It's an established computer lingo. "Fast copy",
    "quick format" (referring to the action of format-ing), "one-click paste", etc.
  created: '2009-10-21 23:28:07'
- body: "\"Copy\" and \"format\" are both nouns, therefore make sense even to those
    who don't get the jargon. \"Remove\" isn't a noun. I know you're saying that it's
    IT jargon (and I did know that) but the whole reason for creating a logo and a
    name is to reach the most number of clients. Using jargon isn't a good way to
    do that.\r\n\r\nI used to work in a university library managing a three-floor
    computer lab. I can only imagine the nightmare meeting I'd have trying to convince
    the board of directors that we needed to buy a product from \"Intelligent Remove\"
    aka \"iTR.\" \r\n\r\nI stand by my opinion that the bad English in the name immediately
    reduces trust in the brand. Not all the people writing checks understand IT jargon."

  body: "\"Quick format\" with \"format\" being noun does not make any technical sense,
    I assume you know that. I don't think that twisting the name into correct English
    only to loose all technical sense is a good idea. If I am looking at three IT
    products - \"Intelligent Removal\", \"Intelligently Remove\" or \"Intelligent
    Remove\" - and I am choosing strictly based on name, third is the only choice.
    I am saying this as a professional software developer and former sysadmin, which
    is as IT as it gets. It <em>is</em> an OK brand as it is along the lines of what
    an average IT person expects from the product name.\r\n\r\nHaving said that I
    agree that overall this is not a great name for the product, and it can be improved.
    But not because it is not grammatically correct, but because it is based on a
    jargon.\r\n\r\n"

- body: Sorry, but "quick format" makes perfect sense if the format is a time frame.
    It's a noun, so it can ALWAYS be modified by an adjective. If you pick an absurd
    adjective/noun combination, like "smelly noise," it doesn't make it grammatically
    incorrect; it just makes it absurd. Or, perhaps, it proves you have a mental illness
    or a brain tumor.

  body: The bounding box for the logo mark has far less black on the left than on
    the right (because of the straight I and cruving R). It's not optically balanced.
    Plus it feels a little tight in there. As well, the corners of the bounding box
    seem default. I don't know why those curves are so fast, or even why they are
    curved at all. I think there is a better logo for the name -- it's kind of fascinating
    that these types of word combinations actually refer to something.

    refers to the process of quickly formatting the disk, i.e. placing special markers
    on the disk that make it suitable for writing/reading files to/from it. I am not
    sure what you mean by "a time frame".'

- body: "No kidding. Are you being intentionally obtuse? \r\n\r\nThe word itself can
    be used as a noun. This is a simple, boring fact. \r\n\r\nGrammatically, \"format\"
    can be defined by any adjective - including \"quick.\" You were arguing that it
    made no sense to say \"quick format\" and I replied by pointing out that it can
    make perfect sense, and therefore, it would not create a grammatically incorrect
    phrase like \"intelligent remove\" that would most likely raise eyebrows of non-nerds.
    The format, in the case of \"quick format\" is a noun. The \"format\" is a process
    made up of steps, and it's quick.\r\n\r\nBut you know what? Neither of us have
    a dog in this fight. This argument is a total waste of time. I'm out. \r\n\r\nGoodnight."

  body: "On purely aesthetic grounds, I agree with the nudging proposal mentioned
    above\r\n ( more than just visually centering the mark inside the containing box,
    it may be good to allow the eye to 'fill in' the left part of that 'T' ). \r\n\r\nYou
    may also want to align the top of the line of type to the top of 'ITR' ( and probably
    do the same with the bottom, by moving the second line up, so that the bottom
    is again aligned ). Then perhaps leave as much 'apparent' negative space between
    the left edge of the type and the right edge of the containing box as there is
    space between the right edge of the ITR mark and that same right edge of the box.
    \r\n\r\nAll of this should tighten things up nicely enough, and, along with making
    the second 'i' in 'intelligent' uppercase, produce an acceptable proposal. But
    I would then propose you then put this design aside as a backup option and start
    fresh. Not to disparage your solution - but hey, it was<em> your</em> gut that's
    been bugging you about this logo : ) \r\n\r\nA company name that includes the
    words 'intelligent' and 'remove' is too exciting a challenge to address by using
    illustrator's pre-made rounded rectangle, for one. I do like the idea of using
    negative space to suggest removal, but the idea needs to sell itself and not have
    any confusing T's in it. ( BTW, if your client is insisting to acronym the company
    ITR, tell them I said they're idiots. ) \r\n\r\nBut I digress\u2014Try looking
    at the iconography of removed or absent content ( in websites, corrupted software
    - or even the physical world ) Speaking of, perhaps incorporating the iconography
    of security or safeguarding is another avenue. Don't want to say more here.. Good
    luck, and don't give up. Hope this was helpful and/or timely..\r\n"

  body: "I would leave as much space at the sides of ITR as the line weight of the
    T. Furthermore, the ITR part looks good to me. I have my doubts behind the name
    and I have no idea where the T comes from, but that has to do with conceptualization,
    which is not what you're asking feedback on as the project name is already fixed.\r\n\r\nAs
    for \"Intelligent Remove\", it might sound harsh but I would scrap this typeface
    all together. The i's are a major issue in my opinion, but besides that I really
    don't think this typeface works. It looks quite cheap somehow. I would probably
    try Din, Futura and Neutraface."
