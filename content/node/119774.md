  body: I think you have it Ryuk, the slanted tops are an altered feature - I can
    find no other font with the curved bottom on the k.

  body: "EDITED \r\nGood find Ryuk. The only other font I found with a golf-club leg
    on the _k_ where the diagonal strokes meet at or near the vertical, is Fresco
    Informal Sans [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrescoInformalAs_kin_4726.png]
    https://ourtype.com/#/try/pro-fonts/fresco-informal/ but it also has golf club
    terminals on _i_ and _n_ and top serifs. I found a few fonts with the gold-club
    leg where they diagonal strokes meet in a \"T\" -- such as Parisine Plus, Plume,
    FF Sanuk, or  Convergence, a Google web font -- or connect to a horizontal bar
    -- such as Andes, FS Lola or Magallanes, or the lower diagonal stroke connects
    to a loop -- such as Aspect or Sassoon Infant.\r\nDon"

    would provide interesting additional letters for supplementary icons, but I have
    no idea how to acquire it. Further info: http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-51586.html\r\nDon"
