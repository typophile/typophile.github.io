body: "This is the digitised and redesigned version of the historical Greek newspaper
  Estia.\r\nThe original typeface was only available in printed form and was taken
  from newspaper sheets kept in archive. The newspapers printing method at that time
  was linotype.\r\nI scanned the letters one by one, retouched them by hand firstly,
  then digitised them using ScanFont and at last edit them with FontLab.\r\nThis was
  done for my MA project in the Masters department of Vakalo School of Art and Design,
  Athens, Greece. My proffesor during this project was Hector Haralambous.\r\nPlease
  give me some feedback on the result.\r\nThank you\r\nSergios Hatzinikolas"

  body: "You've done a very nice job.\r\n\r\nThe only thing is that you should work
    more on your strokes weight consistency. Letters such as \u03C7 (chi), \u03C8
    (psi), \u03BD (nu), \u03B3 (gamma), \u03C4 (tau), \u03BB (lambda), \u03B9 (iota),
    \u03C5 (upsilon), \u03C9 (omega) seem quite thin to me (compared to the rest).
    \u03A5ou should work more on both the spacing and the kerning of the typeface
    too (eg. \u0393\u03B5 and \u03A3\u03C5 look weird). Finally, check on the stroke
    weight relations between your uppercase and lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nCongratulations
    once again.\r\nPlease, upload the final version as well.\r\n\r\nGeorge Triantafyllakos
