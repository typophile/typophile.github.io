  for now).\r\nI have to complete an exam for my university about typography, so I
  would ask if someone can suggest to me some books or other resources  about design
  of numbers.\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\nLuca\r\n\r\n\r\n(Congratulations for
  this forum and site. I've learned a lot of interesting things.\r\nAlready bookmarked.)"
