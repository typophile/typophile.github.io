  body: "This [[http://www.typophile.com/node/38205|older thread]] has a few good
    tips. My (admittedly old) Photoshop comes up with PMS 620C, slightly darker. 619C
    is a bit more lighter.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to use Illustrator, you can try [[http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1045730|this
    script]], which sounds really good."

    is c0 m6 y100 k47\r\n\r\n618 is c0 m0 y91 k34\r\n\r\nThis is according to my Solid

  body: "Using the Solid Coated Pantone palette (Corel Draw 12) it gives your split
    exactly. I like to use an older palette which doesn't differentiate between coated,
    matte and uncoated.\r\n\r\nAnswer is definitely Pantone 5825"

  body: Just dug out my Pantone Survival Kit (solid to process) and Pantone 5825C
    splits down as 0,0,80,60 so who knows where the Corel built-in palette gets its
    splits from but it's not the same as the Pantone specs! Having said that the CMYK
    colours in the Pantone solid to process book are in my opinion often nowhere near
    the Pantone colour. What do you do?
