body: "Seems PC World have had a rebrand with their new Christmas TV advert - can't
  find the logo online though.\r\n\r\nI've taken a screenshot of the advert, but it
  isn't very clear.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PC_6603.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen
  I saw it on TV, the typeface appeared to have some rounded off parts (like on the
  top of the d, one edge of the w, and bottom of the P), similar to Cocon. Any ideas?
  Will try to post a better image if I can find one."

  body: I wondered that, until I came across the additional stuff. Do you think they
    might have redrawn Avant Garde especially for PC World? The web address in the
    top picture appears to be the same face, in a different weight.
