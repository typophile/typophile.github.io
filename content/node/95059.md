body: This is a paint decal from a 60's vintage Alfa Romeo. I can't seem to find a
  font that includes all the variables here, such as the arch top A's, the square
  O in Milano, and the numbers 3,4,7, and 9. Any help would be appreciated[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Transformed_Italver2_6307.JPG]
