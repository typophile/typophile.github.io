  of the new Biblioth\xE8que typographique book,\r\n\u2018Roger Excoffon et la fonderie
  Olive\u2019 \r\n(S. Chamaret, J. Gineste, S. Morlighem)\r\n\r\nRoger Excoffon (1910-1983)
  was a major figure in French typography, the graphic arts and visual communication.
  Most of the typefaces that he designed for the Olive foundry in Marseilles between
  1945 and 1971 with the active support of his director Marcel Olive and his assistants
  (Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida, G\xE9rard Blanchard) became classics of advertising
  printing. These typefaces took over the storefronts and urban space of France and
  beyond. They can still be seen today: we have all come across Banco, an alphabet
  of brawny and dynamic capitals, or Mistral, a successful adaptation of the handwriting
  of the \u2018man of the 20th century\u2019.\r\n\r\nThis book was published on the
  occasion of the centenary of his birth. It celebrates a work of uncommon popularity
  and draws on little-known or previously unpublished documentary material (texts,
  drawings, photographs, advertisements, specimens, etc.). It highlights Excoffon\u2019s
  personal approach, which found its inspiration in the pictorial arts as well as
  the social sciences, while meeting the imperatives of the typographic industry.
  The history of the Olive foundry is told here for the first time: each typeface
  is presented individually, analysed and illustrated. This publication is completed
  with reprints of texts by Excoffon about his craft and his ideas on typography.\r\n\r\nText
  in French and English, 328 pages (64 in colour), 560 images, now available for 42
  euros instead of 47 euros until the 1st of November:\r\nhttp://ypsilonediteur.com/fiche.php?id=95"
