  body: 'The new one is 100 times better! I like how the italic angle matches the
    paper angle. <BR> <BR>My only complaint is the spacing: a bit uneven, and a bit
    loose for the &#34;Starke&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also, I would lower the ascender of the
    &#34;k&#34; to match the height of the &#34;S&#34;. <BR>And I might use a non-descending
    &#34;f&#34; in the claim. <BR> <BR>&#62; The corners of paper will be adjusted
    to <BR>&#62; the type-corners in the final version. <BR> <BR>Do you mean they&#39;re
    going to be less sharp? Yes, that&#39;s needed &#40;even of its own&#41;. <BR>

  body: This is a good improvement. I&#39;m not even sure you need to round the corners
    of the paper to match the typeface. The contrast is nice. What if you just rounded
    the white shapes, the intside shape and left the red sharp? Maybe a little less
    space in between &#34;Starke&#34; and &#34;Druckerei f&uuml;r Kreative&#34;?

    miles newlyn <BR> <BR>I like it because it&#39;s so generic, so of course there
    are a lot of things similar, it certainly isn&#39;t trying to be different. <BR>The
    colours make it look like an industrial sanitation company. The paper looks like
    a sheet of toilet paper. <BR> <BR>miles'

    <BR>Author: Bogdan F Iliescu <BR> <BR>&#40;...&#41; <BR>As I see it in your sketch
    the type means to state solid business and the <BR>paper creativity. I would change
    first the colors. I would make the name red <BR>and the paper blue. I would go
    further and I would try a red/blue scheme for <BR>the paper itself. Blue in the
    name conveys a somehow negative feeling. It is <BR>not the happiest of colors
    especially so full-bodied. <BR> <BR>The last modification I made would be to try
    to link the symbol with the <BR>name a little tighter &#40;make it come underneath
    the name and go top right or <BR>something&#41;. I would also make it a little
    more stylized and a little more <BR>dynamic. I don&#39;t think the twists and
    curves really help &#40;they may create <BR>the &#34;toilet paper&#34; effect
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>.
    Try as little as necessary to make it clear is <BR>a sheet of paper and a really
    fast one and that should do it in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Bogdan'

    your boldness more strong and would  combine better the letterforms to the sign.
