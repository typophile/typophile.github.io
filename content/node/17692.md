  who trains gundogs (Retrievers, Pointers, Setters etc). I really like the Berthold
  cut of Caslon, which seems to sit very nicely with the graphic I have created (a
  dog's head), but wondered if anyone would be kind enough to suggest some alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe
  overall 'feel' I'm after is traditional, solid, reliable, rugged and dependable.
  Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJP"

    I'm not sure I'd describe it as rugged. I'd look for something with a little more
    personality.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably get feedback with more depth if you upload
    the graphic you've made."

  body: Thanks for your reply - I've modded a few of the Caslon characters and ended
    up with a result that both I and my friend are happy with.
