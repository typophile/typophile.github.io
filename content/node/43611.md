body: "Does anyone know of a way to script a feature in OpenType which would allow
  someone to typeset a carriage return and substitute the first lower case character
  typed with a substituted upstroke character for a script face?\r\n\r\nI can get
  the following to work:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub space a' by a.upstroke;\r\n}
  liga;\r\n\r\nBut, interesting enough, I can put a unit value in FontLab glyph decimal
  slot 13 (CR), and script the following:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub CR a' by a.upstroke;\r\n}
  liga;\r\n\r\nThis will complie without errors, but will do nothing in InDesign when
  I typeset a carriage retun and typeset lower case a.\r\nIt will not substitute the
  upstroke lower case a.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\nAlex"

  body: "Pretty much every layout engine I know treats the carriage return as the
    end of the text run. So, trying to get an OpenType contextual substitution that
    uses a CR followed by another glyph is not likely to work.\r\n\r\nLayout engines
    may also treat the CR and other control codes as special cases and not try to
    look them up in the font at all, which would defeat other uses of the CR participating
    in OpenType layout features.\r\n\r\nAdobe actually thought about trying to add
    special \"beginning of line\" and \"end of line\" functionality to OpenType. However,
    these would require pretty active support by the layout engine, so we didn't pursue
    the idea at the time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
