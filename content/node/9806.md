  body: 'I don&#39;t impose my own ideas on the bezier curve -- it tells me what to
    do; it helps me think creatively. <BR> <BR>Yup, the nature of matter -- even digital
    matter -- informs the shapes that we make from it. I doubt if there has ever been
    a sculptor who carves directly in the medium &#40;as opposed to one who models
    in a different medium, such as clay, and then carves&#41;, who has not had the
    sense of form releasing itself from the material. It is a sense of the creative
    response to matter. <BR> <BR>But this sense is less profound the more generic
    and workable the material is and the more sophisticated one&#39;s tools become.
    Take punchcutting for example: the steel is hard but it has no grain like wood
    or stone, so it can be shaped into almost any form with the correct tools, and
    the basic form of any uncut punch is the same: the punch does not suggest the
    form that will be cut. Ironically, digital type is probably more suggestive of
    form than metal, because the granularity of the unit grid and the &#39;grain&#39;
    of the equations that define curves are coarser than steel. I don&#39;t know how
    many times I&#39;ve dragged a bezier handle, intending to create a particular
    kind of curve, and then stopped part way in my motion with the realisation that
    &#39;this, just like that&#39; is better than what I had in mind.'

    is becoming more difficult to find the right type of wood due to deforestation

    it down.</i> <BR> <BR>This is why I want to design with G4-continuous splines
    instead of Beziers. So I am going out to the wilds of differential geometry and
    calculus of variations &#40;from my comfortable existence in the Bay Area&#41;
    to snag some of these curves for myself.'
