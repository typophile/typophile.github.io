body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'd like to get some feedback on these proposed cover designs
  for a set of the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\r\n\r\nThe format
  is 165x230mm, and the covers would be printed on an uncoated (maybe recycled) stock.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bible_5861.jpg]"

  body: "The spacing in \"MATTHEW\" is messy... and hard to fix!\r\n1) Modify the
    \"T\" by making it narrower, and ideally slanting the right serif in the same
    direction as the left one. These tricks will give you more room to tighten up
    the \"TT\".\r\n2) Loosen the \"HE\", and maybe the rest a bit too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Given the traditional typography, some would say that the all caps should
    be set much looser. That would make the spacing easier too. '

  body: I might do the colored text in a silver or metallic colored foil, very attractive
    and will bring the piece up a lot. You could also do the grey image in a silver
    spot metallic ink, or a spot UV on the grey background. Use the printing techniques
    available to really make this minimal design shine.
