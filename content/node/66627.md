body: "Could you please give a brief assessment of logo (see the link below).\r\nIt
  is a new brand for Saare County (26 islands of the Baltic Sea, including the 2nd
  biggest Saaremaa). In order to outline it with \u201Cone word\u201D we came up with
  a finding to outline the strategy - SEAWISE.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this brand
  is not created to mark Saaremaa as a tourist destination only. It equally focuses
  onto the local habitants, investors, enterpreneurs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kiirasoosaar.ee/SB_3m.jpg\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nOtt"

  body: "I quite like it, but the cross as the fish's eye makes me think of dead fish.
    Also, I'm not sure what the extra snowflake like thing is doing in the circular
    marks, I think it's extra.\r\nThe concept fits with my image of the region."

  body: Make me think a bit of a Spaghetti Monster. I like it too, but maybe a tad
    too busy. To me, there needs to be a focal point, whether the fish, gills or spiral.

  body: "Glad to see the fish is no longer dead. Now the eye of the fish draws a lot
    of attention. It competes for the eyes attention with the swirl above it.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your thought behind the swirl and the fish?"
