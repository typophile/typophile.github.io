body: "Hello, I'm working on a visual translation of a Russian Futurist book\u2014Tango
  with Cows\u2014and so I need roman equivalents of the cyrillic used in the book.
  For one of the cyrillic faces I have a specimen of a matching roman face printed
  on coated paper. I'm seeking advice on how best to digitize it. I'm pretty sure
  the face hasn't been digitized but if it has been, this is somewhat of a moot point.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some factors:\r\n\r\n1. I'm mostly interested in this as part of my larger project,
  so I am not that concerned with making a font good enough to license.\r\n2. I'll
  probably only need upper/lower case, a few numerals and a question mark.\r\n3. I'm
  planning on making photopolymer plates to print the final piece, so ideally I'd
  like a digitization of the shape of the metal type, not the ink on paper. The coated
  paper helps in this regard to lessen ink spread, and I'm planning on doing some
  tests to understand more precisely what happens in the bezier curve\u2014>plate\u2014>ink
  on paper process.\r\n4. The specimen I have was printed by me from metal type not
  issued by the manufacturer, so the type is actually somewhat worn. This isn't necessarily
  an issue because the type used in the original was also somewhat worn (I think)
  and definitely not printed so carefully, but I'd like to avoid the clich\xE9 of
  multiple identical instances of broken type. I'd also like to avoid things looking
  too obviously digital.\r\n5. I'd be willing to spend some money to save time and/or
  for a better job, but I wouldn't have a huge budget, I have some bezier curve drawing
  experience but not a huge amount, I do have access to fontlab, but I haven't used
  it.\r\n6. I have a 3200 dpi scan of the specimen, it's 30 point Antique Extra Condensed\r\n\r\nand
  options I've been thinking about:\r\n\r\n1. Just plugging away myself, using either
  Illustrator, Fontlab, Inkscape with Spiro.\r\n2. Hiring some fly-by-night masking
  service to get the outlines mostly done, then tweaking it myself.\r\n3. Hiring an
  actual type designer, what would be a reasonable price to pay? I could also trade
  services, in case someone wants any letterpress printing done."

    all curious of the original of Daniel\u2019s translation: a low-rez PDF of that
    landmark of Russian poetry/typography can be found on the Web site of <em><a href=\"http://imwerden.de/pdf/kamensky_tango_s_korovami_1914.pdf\">ImWerden</a></em>,

    are actually fewer than it might appear at first glance, I've actually made a
    concordance of all the glyphs in the book, and sorted them all into typeface families
    and then individual fonts. There are about 10 families most (if not all) of them
    are Cyrillic equivalents of Berthold faces. There are a lot of sizes and weights
    of Akzidenz, and of Berthold Latinskaya derived from Berthold Lateinisch. The
    rest are all display faces, and most are only in a couple sizes except for the
    cyrillic of Herold Schmal. It was a lot of fun deconstructing all the type as
    it was as though I was looking into a small print shop in Moscow, a hundred years
    ago.\r\n\r\nDo you know of any good book for information about Cyrillic types,
    typography, or the printing industry at that time, 1914? Even if they are in Russian,
    any information would be helpful."
