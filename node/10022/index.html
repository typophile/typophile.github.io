I will show them later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rotis was used as Rotis Serif. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I once also saw a very cheap edition set in Rotis SemiSerif (!). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I was a little upset about that (there is an own story about Rotis and its use in Bavaria where I live - and a huge typographical discussion, also happened here I think), and didn't want to buy it at once.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Later I couldn't find it anymore. It was in a shop for 1-Euro-Books-Rests. Now I only feel sad for the people who will propably tire their eyes with it.

I have to look on them in detail later in my schedule. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course function/economy is of the biggest interest. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The portability issue already practically rose up (I had it in mind before), when I presented the first results to my teacher of typography: The box with all that bibles was hardly portable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I first restricted my paper to bibles that can be held in one hand for reading. But because I wanted to include some editions using interesting fonts - those were design-aware projects and including pictures - so now I have four editions that have to be held with two hands or lying on the table. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thats a good note for me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you think it's worth buying the whole series ($220 plus shipping to germany)?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a theologian/typophile I'm interested in the typographical tradition of the bible from two aspects of view. And I think one can learn typographically a lot from the development of the hebrew/greek editions.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From the information from the website of Oak Knoll I couldn't quite figure out if the edition will suite well to my needs. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my theologian study I already learned a lot of the tradition of manuscripts in the theologian/historian view (and I have books on that too). But now my interest goes to the typographical details and development of that tradition. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that the series covers exactly that point, but I'm not quite sure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And of course it's an amount of money I have to think well about. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The book of De Hamel had already run on my desk (yesterday, in the german edition).
