  principles, color theory and aesthetics books.\r\n\r\nI know Paul Rand was always
  on about making sure you study aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAny books relating back to the
  graphic design field on these topics would be great.\r\n\r\nI've been doing design
  work for about 10 years but never had any formal education."

    Systems in Graphic Design\" by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann|Josef
    M\xFCller-Brockmann]].\r\n- \"The New Typography\" by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold|Jan
    Tschichold]].\r\n\r\nNot merely about aesthetic, but I think this [[http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002514.html|list]]
    might interest you too."
