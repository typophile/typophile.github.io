  & Garden magazine? It kind of looks like Adobe's Poetica. I have tried Whatthefont
  and looked through a few catalogues but cant find it. Probably will kick myself
  once someone tells me as I am sure I have seen it used somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    under Swash which is why it didn't show up on FontFont's website.\r\n"
