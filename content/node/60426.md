    C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts and they should be visible in all
    CS programs. Put them in C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe InDesign CS3\\Fonts (or
    whereever your InDesign resides) and they'll only be visible in CS3. Similar for
    Illustrator and Photoshop.\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m student, so i ain\u2019t got

    perfectly valid: [[http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/openoptions/student.html]]"

  body: "Yes, that's in a nutshell what you opted for.\r\n\r\nMe not being intimate
    to Vista, you can choose between finding out where 'Common files' <em>are</em>
    stored on your system, or repeating the ad hoc fix for Illy and PS.\r\n\r\nA few
    of the common files on my system (XP) are \"Version Cue CS3 Bitte lesen.html\"
    (Adobe Version Cue), Adobe AIR.dll, MSADDNDR.DLL (MS Designer), patchjre.exe (Sun
    Java), CAPSULES.ELM (MS Themes), and sam.spd (MS TTS). Find one of these and the
    rest should be there as well."

    install the version cue because I don't know what it is.. Perhaps that is affecting
    my problem.. I have no idea. But hell yeah, Vista sucks hard, 64 bits even more
    -.-\r\n\r\nTHANKS"

  body: "Re: ad hoc: If copying your font into the ID fonts folder worked, but for
    ID only, you can repeat that for Illy & PS. It's 'ad hoc' -- at the spur of the
    moment -- because the <em>proper</em> way would have been placing them into the
    shared fonts folder. If Microsoft hadn't discontinued that option.\r\n\r\n\"Version
    Cue\" does nothing with fonts; it's just one of the programs in my Common folder.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'm having high hopes for Win7. It can't be any worse. It just can't be."

    this working cause i really need to install my font collection... and i dont want
    to open ID and \"vectorize\" the desired text with the font i want and paste it
    in Illy or PS. IT's just wrong, boring and hard working. :P\r\n\r\nThank you for
