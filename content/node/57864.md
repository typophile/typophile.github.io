    in culture and history, and manuscripts are always inspiring for anyone who appreciates

    in Kurdish villages in northern Iraq, where he hopes to soon begin work on collections
    in ancient monastic libraries. \"You have these ancient Christian communities,

    now seeking access to manuscript collections in Iran and Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nI hope
    He is successful.\r\n\r\npowers"
