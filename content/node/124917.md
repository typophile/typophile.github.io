    and EOT (for older IE versions) for commercial fonts. But usually, you don\u2019t
    really need to worry about that. If you buy a webfont license, you can download
    a webfont package, where everything is already prepared for web use.\r\nFor free
    fonts, there is the Fontsquirrel webfont generator, which works quite good. "

  body: Server based font management software allows the end user to control their
    licensed fonts. It is not a solution for the foundry to control distribution/use
    of their fonts. This would be Digital Rights Management or "DRM" for fonts. There
    is no practical system for foundries to do this that is widely accepted, and what
    solutions exist impose a substantial burden on users.

    about FontShop when say this mobile font for 50.000 installation ?!\r\n"

    pay for 5 users, but install the font software on 6 computers, you act in breach
    of agreement, i.e. you don\u2019t have a valid license then \u2013 which is what
    you paid for in the first place."

    downloaded an illegal MP3?\r\n\u2022 downloaded an illegally posted movie or video
    clip (maybe an \"adult\" clip)?\r\n\u2022 downloaded an illegally posted image
    from an adult pay site?\r\n\u2022\_downloaded an image and used it in some way
    (like a presentation)?\r\n\r\nIf so you\u2019ve probably violated copyright.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    wrong, but I\u2019ll bet many folks at Typophile have done these things. Especially
    the younger folks. \r\n\r\nIt's the same with fonts. At large firms a manager
    may be in charge of font licenses, but everywhere else I doubt if anyone even
    reads the license. Young folks copy MP3s, movies, fonts, etc., and if you tell
    them it's wrong they look at you like you're crazy. It's unfortunate but that's
    the reality.\r\n"

    barriers used to enforce them."
