  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, just wondering if there was a preferred font for home made signs like Car Boot Sale or Village Fayre, say for a post by the side of the road?  Something that is easily read from a passing car but also doesn't use too much ink from an ink-jet printer.

Also, is there a technical term for the (non-existent) space between the text and the edge of the space available?

Example (not my sign)
Thanks

That would be the left and right margins. In the example shown, the margins were apparently set to zero. Or perhaps it originally had some margins but then the paper was trimmed to fit the signboard.</div>

It's too broad a question. It's like someone you've never met asking you to pick clothes for them.

In general you'd want a font that was easy to read (not highly condensed or stylized), probably in upper & lower case rather than all caps, and big enough to be read at the distance people will see it (you might want to do a test). 

Beyond that your choice of fonts will depend on picking a font that's appropriate for the event. What kind of event are you advertising? What kind of people do you want the sign to attract? And so forth. For example the appropriate fonts for an old-fashioned ice cream social might be different than ones for a hot-rod show. 

As far as saving ink, I doubt if it's going to be a big factor if you're just making a few signs.</div>

It's for a "Car Boot Sale", right? Not Macy's. 

A slick, professional looking sign probably won't help you. Personally, and maybe it's just me, but I tend to be a little more wary of those people at flea-markets, garage sales, farmers markets, etc. who have professionally made signs. I tend to assume I won't get a good deal from them. 

If you want to save ink and have th time and inclination, you could print your sign in a faint colours and fill in the colours by hand... Just a thought. have fun with it.

		<div class="commentbody">Well... I was half-expecting, "Use the same font as the regular road signs". Transport, Interstate, Highway Gothic or Clearview Hwy, etc.

Anyway, have you seen the price of printer ink these days. I was thinking if using no fill and upping the stroke would work. Good idea about the fill with a marker pen.

Lowering the opacity would have the same effect as eco-font from a distance wouldn't it?

I'm just curious, there's no actual project involved.

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I think hand-lettering signs is half the fun of a yard sale.* Or, for similar enjoyment, use transfer letters or those vinyl stickers, whatever they're called.

* Now, here's a way to save ink, and, more importantly, get something that looks like type on a poster too large to print.

1. Type and print message as large as you want it (maybe on several sheets of paper combined).
2. Trace over the outline of the letters in pencil on the back of the sheets.
3. Put printouts on top of foam core (etc), tape in place, rub or scribble over edges of letters
4. The outline of the letters is transferred to the poster.
5. Fill in with marker or paint</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Zeb, if your budget is extremely tight then just hand print them with a marker. It won't cost anything and is perfectly appropriate for a homemade sign.

Or make one with your inkjet printer and then make xerox copies. Black and white Xeroxes will just cost a few cents each. Most copy shops can Xerox up to 11 x 17 (the size of two 8.5 x 11 sheets side by side), which might be a better size for a poster.

Yeah, a sign that's small enough to be printed on a desktop inkjet probably isn't going to get read by most passing traffic anyway.  It's just too small.  Unless maybe it's posted on a street where people drive very slowly, or next to a stop sign.</div>
