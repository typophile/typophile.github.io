  utterly hooked on it.  However, my knowledge is still incredibly limited, so I was
  wondering if anyone could offer some suggestions regarding a font for a logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  company is called 'exocet' and is to be depicted in lowercase characters, and I
  want to be able to use a font that somehow resembles or evokes the same kind of
  feeling as the typefaces used in old penguin books, and the like.\r\n\r\nSo: a serif
  font that's not too clean and tidy, and could translate well enough at various sizes.
  \ The only thing I've come across that's close, as an example, is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/milton/|Milton
  MN Demi Bold]].  I know it's not one that would've been used as body, but it's just
  an idea as to the sort of thing that i'm after.\r\n\r\nDoes this even make any sense?\r\n\r\nHope
  it does..."

    more in the vein of body texts: Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe Jenson Pro & Adobe Caslon
    Pro.\r\n\r\nYou could always use those as a base and then customize it how you
    want . . .\r\n\r\npenn"

    would mix various weights of   Monotype Bembo and Monotype Centaur Titling. \r\nFor
    the the King Penguin Series quite a few: Pastonchi, Walbaum, Lutetia (by Jan van

  body: "Thanks for the input; I never really considered the adobe fonts (for no good
    reason at all), but they're actually not bad - just not quite what I had in mind.
    \ And I can definitely see myself using that information about Penguin books at
    a later date.\r\n\r\nBut, having said all that and after a meeting i had with
    the clients, the whole look and feel were changed and they've settled on [[http://i38.tinypic.com/or2ik7.gif
    | this]] design, which uses 'Verve', slightly modified.  The font used in the
    lower left-hand corner of the business card is Daxline Pro (extra bold I think),
    and I was planning on using it throughout their identity, including body text.
    \ The only thing is, I'm not too sure how well it works as a legible body font,
    and was wondering if anyone knew of any pitfalls associated with using it as such.\r\n\r\nOr
    perhaps there are some alternatives someone knows about?  Daxline is the closest
    i could find to compliment the logo and logotype, but any other suggestions would
    be great.\r\n\r\nP.s Sorry if this too much of a topic-change."
