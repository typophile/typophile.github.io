  body: It&#39;s pretty Perpetua-esque with a hint of Centaur, but not quite. I guess
    I&#39;m just too tired &#40;yawn&#41;.

  body: This is getting <i>SO</i> frustrating. There&#39;s this very familiar air
    to this face, and yet... The FontBook nor Rookledge&#39;s International Typefinder
    were of much help. It&#39;s no Dutch Type Library, Font Bureau, Inc. nor Ensched

  body: Closest match I&#39;ve seen till now &#40;I should check Font Bureau fonts
    on MyFonts.com, not on their own site where the samples are somewhat meagre&#41;.
    Good show, Tiff! <BR> <BR>I miss the Perpetua-style lc &#34;y&#34; and the UC
    &#34;C&#34; with top serif only, though.

  body: Don&#39;tcha think it&#39;s a Eric Gill design? There&#39;s a lot of earmarks
    pointing that way.

  body: Nah, I&#39;m full a&#39; crap. The lc &#39;a&#39; nor &#39;r&#39; don&#39;t
    fit the Gill rationale, methinks.

  body: It is similar. That &#39;y&#39; is a gill-like &#39;y&#39; too. It&#39;s kinda
    Perpetua, kinda Aries. But the lowercase &#39;a&#39; isn&#39;t castrated like
    his, nor is the &#39;r&#39; blunt-ended.

  body: 'No, it&#39;s not <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206042">Gill
    Facia</a>. I wouldn&#39;t describe that Monotype monstrosity as &#39;Eric Gill&#39;s
    Facia&#39;: it&#39;s a typeface to which Gill&#39;s name has been added, but which
    he did not design and would likely have detested.'

  body: John. DIdn&#39;t see you there. You&#39;re right though. Now that I found
    it &#40;spelled it incorrectly&#41;, I know how wrong it would be. It certainly
    isn&#39;t a face for books, that&#39;s for sure. Colin Banks based his design
    on a facia that Gill did for a bookseller in Paris. I believe it was WHSmith,
    but can&#39;t remember exactly. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/gill-facia-mt/regular/?s=Eric%2BGill%2BWHSmith"
