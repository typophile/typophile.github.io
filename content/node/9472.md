  body: It is hard to tell from a small sample and relatively few characters but I&#39;m
    betting it was hand-drawn.

  body: I agree with Patty. It doesn&#39;t look like anything familiar to me, and
    letters like that W seem like you would recall them. It&#39;s more likely that
    it was done completely by hand than that someone &#39;played&#39; with a font.
    <BR> <BR>If you have some calligraphic skill, you might make your own W, b and
    g, which seems like the most atypical letters in this sample. However, I presume
    your purpose is not to re-create this, but to identify the typeface to use for
    other purposes. <BR> <BR>One that I know with at least a somewhat similar W is
    P22&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sherwood/p22-roanoke-script/p22-roanoke-script/testdrive.html?s=Williamsburg&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Roanoke Script</a>, and it even tries to reflect a style roughly
    from the Colonial era &#40;or earlier&#41;.  <BR> <BR>You could look in Part 10
    of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a> for other Antique Handwriting fonts. Not sure what qualities
    you are looking for, but at least I know these are actually fonts.

  body: I have a much larger sample in print with me, but I posted the smaller graphic
    link because it was already online.  And you&#39;re right, I need the font for
    a commercial to use with other text than &#34;Williamsburg&#34;.  I&#39;m still
    convinced it&#39;s a font with looking at the exactness of tips &#40;between the
    tops of the s and r&#41;, the i&#39;s and l&#39;s being identical to each other
    &#40;though I suppose there&#39;s something to be said for copy and paste :p&#41;  No
    less, I appreciate your input and suggestions!  The Roanoke font is a mix of the
    font I was looking for and a different one inside the brochure, so may be more
    perfect than finding the fonts I was trying to.  Thanks so much <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Based on that sample, I would say the two l&#39;s are not identical, adding
    weight to the hand-drawn theory. The i connections are not identical either --
    this is definitely hand-drawn lettering.

  body: 'There are a few other earmarks indicating this is custom lettering and not
    a font: <BR> <BR>- The wide looping descender on the g &#40;which would not work
    in a font after another character with a descender&#41;. <BR> <BR>- A similar
    case with the b. Both sides would collide with other tall characters. <BR> <BR>-
    The b and u connect differently than other pairs. <BR> <BR>- The W would be very
    awkward with short words or words that start with Wh &#40;e.g., Why&#41;.'

    its handwritting based on a historic document.

  body: Hi, It&#39;s Michael Clark. The Williamsburg above is a digital rendering
    of the Original &#34;Colonial Williamsburg&#34; not Historic... I was given the
    original logo and extrapolated the font from the two words. The letters in W&#39;burg
    are digitized as they were and there are no problems with letter fit or leading
    as was suggested. It is a proprietary font for in house use only.
