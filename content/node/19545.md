  in an overcast region of East London...)\r\n\r\nI've started playing with a type
  logo for a very painty portfolio. I'm going with type to offset the hand-drawn-ness
  of the rest of the site. However, I'm worried that I'm commiting some horrid typographic
  faux pas. Basically...\r\n\r\n...Is it \"ok\" to massively distort text by ramping
  up the stroke weights until you've made a monster of what was a simple and elegant
  character, is it looked down on? It seems like such an easy thing to do, and some
  of the results, having messed with other faces looked pretty nice. I don't like
  the idea of it though, it's such an out-of-the-box conclusion...\r\n\r\nI rather
  like the results, but it feels wierd to have mutated the text so much. The main
  text is Century Old Style (5pt) & the numeral '1' is Letter Gothic (20pt).\r\n\r\nYour
  thoughts would be interesting (forgive me if the real faux pas is having very little
  experience with type and asking a silly question ;)    \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nP

    without tampering with it.. what fun is that!\r\n\r\nyou took something and tried
    to make it your own, thats a great process in my opinion..\r\n\r\nand besides,
    thinking within the box is dull anyway.. !"

    [sic] :) - and not at all dull!\r\n\r\nI'm really pleased with the look of the
    text, so I'm going to keep playing. I'm like a tiny child when it comes to design,
    I need constant reassurance.\r\n\r\nTo both of you, I thank you kindly....."

  body: "Peter, this broad effect has already been done in typefaces, eg ITC Pacella,
    with a polished typographic finish.\r\nIt was an effect that could be achieved
    photographically (a \"mod\") with the phototypositor machine c.1970, and that
    is probably what gave the inspiration to Mr Pacella.\r\nSo in sense, you have
    committed a faux pas, because back in the day they would have cleaned up their
    artwork, and set it looser to begin with, so that the overlapping didn't occur.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there is a lot of typographic progress that has resulted when one generation's
    artefacts become the next's rasion d'etre. That kind of thing was a large part
    of David Carson's working method. \r\n\r\nAnd we've had the de-skilling of art
    in recent years, which has happened in design too, so that work which is TOO slick
    is the faux pas.\r\n\r\nI would say, if you got your hands dirty (so to speak)
    and did the work yourself and experimented till you got a result that clicks for
    you (not to mention the client...), no worries. "

    body: "Hey Nick,\r\n\r\nJust checking Pacella Black Italic, very nice, although
      I'm definately fond of the spacing I've \"achieved\" with the Century. I would've
      been happier had I actually set these on a press / phototypositor and achieved
      the effect, notching up a slider bar in Illustrator doesn't really constitute
      getting my hands even remotely dirty! For someone who doesn't really like current
      trends in using random abstract arbitrary 'clutter' as an illustrative tool
      (paint splats and composites of scratchy lines), I should steer clear of the
      above effect - I'd like to understand why I like it first, what it's doing to
      the letters and why it works for me...Ideally.\r\n\r\nForgive me if I've misunderstood
      - In this arena I'm amateurish at best.\r\n\r\nIntresting stuff Nick. Thanks..."

    Aleister Crowley who lifted it from a Greek philosopher whose name escapes me
    - the original is \"Do what thou wilt\"\r\n\r\nIt is also part of the Wiccan creed.\r\n\r\npeace"
