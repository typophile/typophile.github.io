  something similar to \"Expand Masters\" and I cant figure out why. Before, it always
  kept the original masters but removed the overlap, now it takes the master I have
  visible and make that one as master on every master.\r\n\r\nIs this some preference

  body: Most interesting. Doesn't the same annoying thing happen if you invoke the
    change weight command? Have you upgraded recently? For those who need to, several
    different versions of Fontlab 5 can be installed on the same machine according
    to a technique Adam Twardoch has devised - - at least on Win. Must be possible
    on Mac too, I just haven't tried it.

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nI'm quite surprised that you're saying it ever worked. I don't
    remember that it ever worked. The problem is: imagine an MM glyph with two squares
    (so there are 8 nodes in the glyph). In the first master the squares are small
    and do not overlap, in the second master the squares are larger and overlap. A
    perfectly normal case. Now if you'd try to remove the overlaps, the first master
    should not change but in the second master it would have to remove some nodes,
    so you'd end up having incompatible masters. \r\n\r\nThis is why remove overlap
    in FLS is not MM-compatible. I agree it would be nice if the function was written
    so that it removes overlap in each master and then blends the masters together,
    and \"fails\" only if the final masters are not compatible. I'll suggest that
    to our developers. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I suggest that you leave the overlaps
    in your MM and remove them only in the generated instances. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    all 5.x-releases for fonts with two masters but not for more.\r\n\r\nA workaround
    if you work with a 4+ master font is to generate an single master instance for
    each master, do the merging on each one of them, go back to the MM font and assign
    masks from on single master at a time and use the mask to outline function for
    that master. It works if the outlines are compatible,\r\n\r\n"

    a small macro that simply copies everything from one master to the other (redundant)
    one, which I occasionally run.

    at all. It might influence operations such as auto-hinting, but not the final
    outlines in the single masters.\r\n\r\nThe third master can have square shaped
    o\u2019s or whatever without interfere with the outlines that goes from thin (first
