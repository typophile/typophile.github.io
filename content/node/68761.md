  body: "... also other things :) but since you  mentioned it.\r\n\r\nThe name Atnah
    Hafukh was given by Prof. Yeivin.  He said that the distinction between  atnah
    hafukh and yerah ben yomo 'serves as an indicator of the accuracy and purity of
    the tradition of the accentuation in a manuscript.'\r\n\r\nSee the editions by
    Prof. Dotan (Adi,1973) and Prof. Breuer  --  there's a clear distinction between
    \ atnah hafukh and yerah ben yomo.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why we waited so
    long; every decade they add couple glyphs  :)\r\nNow this is funny: \r\nUnicode,
    page 237: \"but some users in recent decades have begun to reintroduce this distinction\"\r\n'some
    users'?! what they mean by 'some users'?\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, there's a draft by the
    SII (2/2010) without this distinction! (I emailed them, so let's wait and see
    what is the answer)\r\n"

  body: "<em>See the editions by Prof. Dotan (Adi,1973) and Prof. Breuer -- there's
    a clear distinction between atnah hafukh and yerah ben yomo.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    but the way in which Unicode has chosen to encode atnah hafukh is problematic,
    because this is a character disunification, i.e. both atnah hafukh was previously
    presumed to be encoded as the same character as yerah ben yomo; now, it is encoded
    distinctly, but with the necessary caveat that existing documents will not make
    this distinction. However, because it is the form of yerah ben yomo that changes
    between when the distinction is not made and when it is made -- the atnah hafukh
    is the typical form when no distinction is made --, there is an inevitable incompatibility
    between existing documents and new fonts. Simply put, an existing document using
    U+05A2 for both atnah hafukh and yerah ben yomo will display with the wrong glyph
    in a font that supports this character distinction with appropriate glyphs for
    atnah hafukh and yerah ben yomo. There's no easy way around this, which is why
    the current build of the SBL Hebrew font still does not make a visual distinction
    between these two characters: the atnah hafukh glyph is used for both. I'm willing
    to change this, but have been waiting to see what feedback there is from users.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    don't understand why we waited so long; every decade they add couple glyphs</em>\r\n\r\nFrankly,
    I think the Israeli standards body must bear a lot of blame for the problems in
    Unicode encoding of Hebrew. They appear to have had almost no interest at all
    in anything except the encoding of modern standard Hebrew, and gave only cursory
    and unsystematic attention to Biblical text. These are the people who encoded
    the Biblical upper punctum extraordinarium but not the lower one, on the grounds
    that the latter was very rare. Even if a character is used only once, it is still
    a character.\r\n\r\nRegarding the text that ends up in the Unicode Standard, e.g.
    \"some users in recent decades have begun to reintroduce this distinction\", this
    generally reflects whatever was said in the proposal(s) for the new characters.
    In the case of vowel and accent distinctions, e.g. qamats qatan vs qamats gadol
    or atnah hafukh vs yerah ben yomo, these were not as uncontroversial as one might
    have expected, hence 'some users', acknowledging that at least some members of
    the Unicode Hebrew community argued that these disunifications were unnecessary
    and would break existing practices."

  body: "Whether the blame goes to the Israeli standards, or the Unicode Consortium,
    or both of them  -- the problem still remains. Your description --  \"There's
    no easy way around this...the atnah hafukh glyph is used for both\" --  is basically
    the 'by-product' that could have  been avoided a long time ago. \r\n  \r\nEstablished
    editors and scholars such as Prof. Dotan, Prof. Breuer and Prof. Yeivin  cared
    about that distinction. When the information is reachable I don't think we should
    wait a long time to add one glyph or two. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don't  know whether or
    not these  different proposals  are  hot topics of debate, but not everything
    should be based on 'popular' demand, or 'popular' agreement. For example, I've
    been working for a l-o-n-g time on the Babylonian vocalization & masorah.  There's
    no doubt that the average user  & publisher would not need that, but the academic
    world  would need that.  But if adding one dot or two is based on the rare factor,
    then I think that the Babylonian vocalization would be added when the Messiah
    is here.\r\n\r\nBTW,  to paraphrase Prof. Yeivin, this distinction serves as an
    indicator of the accuracy of the bible's editor. \r\n"

    for this? I can help put it together in appropriate form for submission to Unicode
    and ISO 10646, and can also get the Canadian JTC1 SC2 standards body to add their
    name to it for greater weight.\r\n\r\nCharacters are added to Unicode when people
    document them and submit proposals. If no one is doing this work, then it doesn't
    happen. The Israeli standards body shows no interest at all in anything beyond
    standard modern Hebrew and Tiberian vocalisation, so waiting for them to do anything
    is pointless. The recent additions have all been as a result of individual submissions.\r\n\r\n[I
    have been in contact with one other person interested in encoding Babylonian vowel
    marks, but didn't receive a full and systematic list from her suitable for a proposal.]"

    email archive, but as I said, this wasn't full and systematic documentation, which
    is why it didn't progress to a formal proposal.
