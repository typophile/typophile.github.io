  body: "Kleukens Antiqua is a typeface designed by F. W. Kleukens and was available
    from Bauer from about 1900 onwards. Your 1923 image is a general match to the
    Nick Curtis version, which a close rendition of the original typeface. The main
    difference is the horizontal crossbar on e. I checked the character set of the
    Bauer font as shown in Jaspert's 1970 Type Encyclopaedia but it has only the sloped
    crossbar e. There also seem to be minor differences in the serifs, particularly
    for the S. A couple of possibilities. 1. A revised version of the font was available
    in 1923. 2. Noting that the scale of the letters seems to have been very large,
    they may have been hand lettered.\r\nOne way or another, I agree with Nick that
    Kleukens Antiqua is the match.\r\nBTW did you notice that the tickets cost 5 million
    Marks!\r\nDon"
