  body: "Lettering, probably based on a mix of Art Deco ideas rather than a single
    font. The rounded tips are perhaps the result of the sign machining process rather
    than a design decision.\r\nAs for font ideas you might pick up the oblong shape
    of O and the crossbars that extend to the left of the LHS stroke from a font like
    Aldous/Huxley Vertical http://www.identifont.com/similar?3TS \r\nand the C & G
    from a font like Washington http://www.identifont.com/show?9Y0\r\nalso you might
    check Neutra Condensed Medium http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface\r\nDon"
