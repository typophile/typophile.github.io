body: "I tried to get an ID on this one a couple of years ago, but Typophile uncharacteristically
  drew a blank. I found it again looking through some old picture folder on my hard
  drive, and wonder if I may be luckier in the new system?\r\n\r\nIt's from a paperback
  book cover I saw at my parents' house, published sometime in the 70s as far as I
  recall. I'm looking for the authors' names' typeface, not the big one in the middle.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maja1_6260.jpg]"

  body: I'm giving it another bump. I refuse to believe no-one has seen a typeface
    that's as late as the phototype era. ;)
