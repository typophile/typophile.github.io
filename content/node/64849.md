  to leave it in the hands of the Typophile community (already burned two hours on
  this, need to get back to work lol)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the font seen on the
  startup splashes for Adobe CS4 programs (Photoshop, Flash, etc). Not Myriad Pro,
  but the copyright information font on the bottom.\r\n\r\nI've attached a link to
  a screenshot of what i'm talking about. Area in question is highlighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a

  for the help typophiles!"

    you suggested, and MiniFonts has 3 or 4 that come really close. I'll probably
    end up using one of those, but i'd like to know what Adobe used for this, just
    out of curiosity. \r\n\r\nThanks again!"
