body: "Hi everyone. I'm new here, and I chose this forum as a last resort, to identify
  a font.  Even though I can grasp some graphic work, I'm a programmer, not designer,
  so please bear with me. \r\n\r\nIn short, I have to build a site, using fonts that
  are present on a flyer from the company. Of course, no one could provide any information,
  just an image (jpg) of 72dpi. I've tried a few offline/online tools to identify
  it, Google-d around quite some time, but the result wasn't the desired one. So I've
  edited the image, and cropped the only word which has that font. Here it is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font2_5632.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  closest guess of mine would be those:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/610732/NeueFrutigerProBlack-product.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/517462/DINNextPaneuropeanBold-ot-cff-w1g-font.html?showVariation=727058\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/neue_frutiger_pro_black/\r\n\r\nbut
  obviously they are not the right ones. \r\n\r\nWell, my question is simple. Could
  someone kindly decipher it, and name it, or, even better, could someone suggest
  me the closest alternative? I don't know yet if the client would pay for a font,
  but I'm almost sure not. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nAndrew"

    I thought, it couldn't be the ubiquitous Gotham, could it? It appears to be so:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/styles/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gotham_5768.png]"

  body: Montserrrat, a Google font, is often suggested as an alternate to Gotham,
    but it only comes in roman and bold, not black, weights.

    the Gotham Black font. Thank you very very much.\r\n\r\nYou saved me further useless
    hours of digging. Greatly appreciate it. Both of you. I'll mark it resolved right
    away.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day/night.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew. "
