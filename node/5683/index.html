  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">From a specimen book turning yellow with age, a new business associate has come up with a font I need to identify. Please see attachment - part of a prototype he did the way we used to do it 25 years ago - cardboard, glue, cover sheet. The font is not unlike the Franklin Gothic family - but the tail of the Q comes off the middle of the bottom and curls right. Assistance appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">The A &amp; Y in your sample are not monotone, and that makes it look like the ATF version of Franklin Gothic, which has that style of R. News Gothic has that style of R, but it is monotone. Your Q description made me think of Folio, but it doesn&#39;t have that kind of R, and it is not monotone either. I think foundries had types they just called Gothics, with numbers &#40;like Gothic No.18&#41;, but at least the ones in my old Linotype book, looked mostly like Franklin Gothic with the right-of-center Q tail, and the majority of them were condensed. <BR> <BR>If you could show the Q, M and G &#40;if all you have is upper case&#41; it would make IDing it easier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Except for the Q it looks like an extra heavy weight of Franklin Gothic. I looked &#40;quickly&#41; through Mac McGrew&#39;s book on American Metal Typefaces, and didn&#39;t see a Franklin Gothic this heavy. Often at extreme weights some of the letterforms are changed. Maybe that&#39;s why this Q is different from the usual Franklin Gothic? Another explanation is that sometimes when there is a very popular typeface, as this was for many decades, other foundries develop alternative versions with new names, and one or two slight differences to avoid the appearance of copying the type. This could be from such a face. <BR> <BR>Do you know whose specimen book it&#39;s from? Is it American? How old is it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep looking, but I&#39;m running out of showings of old typefaces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some of the Grotesques have similar Q&#39;s, but in almost every case I saw, the R was unlike this one, and usually the letters were monotone &#40;even weight strokes&#41;. <BR> <BR>Record Gothic, designed by R. H. Middleton has a Q like this and the right sort of R, but it is also monotone. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve used up my resources. My best guess is that this is a heavy weight variation of Franklin Gothic from some relatively obscure foundry &#40;whose types didn&#39;t make any of the books I looked through&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Absolutely ask for suggestions on alternative fonts if the original is not available.  <BR> <BR>One alternative -- especially if your associate wants a number of different weights, is <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/index.html">Knockout</a> by H&amp;FJ. The letterforms are different, but on the whole it&#39;s a very powerful face with many weights.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that&#39;s a fair question. What we don&#39;t appreciate is &#39;can you tell me where I can get something like it for free?&#39; <BR> <BR>My suggestion is to go over to <a href="http://www.fontpool.com/categories/index.html" target="_blank"> The Font Pool</a> and pick the style category you are interested in. Then type in a word or two that you want to use. They will show you hundreds, if not thousands of fonts using those words &#40;or letters&#41;, and you can pick one that way. <BR> <BR>The reason I suggest that, instead of suggesting a font, is that &#39;clean and strong&#39;, &#39;interest&#39;, &#39;finish&#39; and &#39;contemporary&#39; are all very subjective terms. You know what you mean by them. <BR> <BR>You can also do something similar at MyFonts.com if you register. You can set up your own sample phrase for the font showings. <BR> <BR>Now, having said all that, I will say that what seems &#39;contemporary&#39; these days is geometric fonts, because we are in a retro stage where Art Deco and Bauhaus looks are apparently &#39;in&#39; again. Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones Gotham is used a lot, and Futura is timeless and has lots of weights. I&#39;d start with one of those.</div>
