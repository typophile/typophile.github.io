body: I have enountered some professional cohorts who are hesitant to license fonts.
  They say that everyone uses traded/downloaded fonts, and they will do so unless
  they simply cannot get the font files any other way than by buying them. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  trying to educate these acquaintences about the foolishness and dishonesty of this
  path, but they do not believe there is any risk. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any anecdotes
  or news reports of design professionals getting in trouble for using unlicensed
  fonts? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Material risk, there really isn&#39;t. Unless you put your theft in writing
    and send it to the font house in question. <BR> <BR>Your only real avenue is appealing
    to their sense of dignity. This might be helped by explaining that type designers
    exist, they&#39;re human, and rarely rich. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
