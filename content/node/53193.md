body: "Hi! How's it going! I'm excited. Because my first font [[http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Newt%20Serif&producttype=TYP%2CIMG%2CILL|is
  now on the market]] with Veer!\r\n\r\n\r\nI developed Newt Serif with the help of
  the Typophile Critique forum ([[http://www.typophile.com/salamander|here]]). After
  a long time, it's finally come to fruition. The character set includes Basic Latin,
  Latin-1, and Latin Extended-A codepages, along with a few other characters here
  and there. There are four weights -- Light, Regular, Demi, and Bold, each with an
  italic. Thanks for the help, everyone! I hope you like it."
