  Thanks in advance!

    e.g. Apple Didot, combine quite well."

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nThank you for your recommendation and sorry I didn't reply
    sooner. After looking at Didot (and some of the similar Identifont recommendations),
    I'm looking for something with a little more weight to it. Did think Acanthus
    Text might look nice. \r\n\r\nConversely, I have been looking at perhaps picking
    up Insigne's regular Aviano family as its style would be appropriate for the book's
    content and could possibly serve as the basis of a logotype for the book. I'm
    slightly concerned with its extended nature, but anything of a similar style I
    would be definitely be interested in looking at. "
