  you help me identify this font? I am a film maker and I would like to use something

  fonts if not the exact one. Thanks ahead of time.\r\n\r\nTarik"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I have both ITC Serif Gothic and Liberty but I
    don't think I have a set with an alternative "E". Where's the place to get the
    alternative "E"?
