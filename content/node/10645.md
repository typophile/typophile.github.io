body: The Disappearing Euro <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently in the final testing stages
  of a new typeface created in Fontlab 4.5.1. It&#39;s postscript Type 1 set to Imported
  encoding. When I test strings of text in InDesign 2.0 any instance of the Euro or
  Apple symbol are left blank. Is this a standard for InDesign? Or is this on my end?  <BR>
  <BR>Of course the symbol can be inserted via Insert Glyphs but not with a keystroke.
  Using my system True Type fonts the Euro and Apple do however show up without using
  Insert Glyphs. <BR> <BR>Anyone have experience with this?

    fonts and InDesign 2.0?
