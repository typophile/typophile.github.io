  body: I thought Futura but the M was not right, then thought Gill Sans but the R
    wasn&#39;t right! <BR>Have not been able to find anything that matches. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the quick reply.

  body: Nonono, you were correct. It&#39;s just that they used the two different  <BR>typefaces
    together. Check the links I added to my previous post. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
