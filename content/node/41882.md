    years now.

  body: "One could argue about whether it\u2019s fashion or rather availability, as
    Rosewood comes bundled with Adobe software.\r\nIt really <em>is</em> a nice typeface,
    charmingly uneven."

  body: Kate, this kind of typeface is used very often like Mike said, even in Montreal
    where you took that picture. It appeared just after the "circus types" like Zebrawood
    and Rosewood Regular back in 2001-2002.

  body: One of the reasons it's uneven is that it's meant to be the method for coloring
    the fill on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/rosewood_std_ot/">Rosewood</a>.
    Fascinating how popular it's become. I guess it shows that there's a demand for
    imperfect wood stuff.

  body: I feel like I'm meant to apologize for not noticing it earlier. My only excuse
    is that it's now all over the metro with that accounting firm campaign, so it
    bubbled up through my subconscious on a few long trips on the Orange Line.
