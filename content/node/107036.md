body: "This image has been making the rounds in Spain recently after the match between
  Real Madrid and Barcelona last Saturday. It's an alleged tweet by Madrid defender
  Sergio Ramos, who's famous for making all kinds of less than fortunate remarks on
  Twitter. If you can read Spanish, you'll get the (unintentional) joke.\r\n\r\nThe
  thing is, although it would be possible for Sergio Ramos to make such a ridiculous
  statement, the typography looks a little off. It is very similar to Georgia, which
  is what a lot of Twitter clients are set in, but not quite. The glyphs look slightly
  thinner and there is less contrast. Plus, the Os look a little rounder than usual.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone tell me if this indeed Georgia or something else?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nNico

    css code as it's embedded as WebFont (or if you're a Chrome user, install [[http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html|Whatfont]]
