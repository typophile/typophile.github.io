  what I have so far. Currently it resides in Illustrator, and hasn&#39;t been fontified
  yet. At this stage I&#39;m trying to decide whether to keep it a stencil face. Any
  other thoughts? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13988.jpg"

  body: I think what you have so far is quite interesting. I don&#39;t mind it being
    a stencil face, but I think you need to change the stencil gaps a bit so it doesn&#39;t
    just look like a &#34;font with a line through each letter&#34;. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: 'Paul -- good call on the serifs. I did away with them for now. <BR> <BR>Jim,
    I enjoy the House collection a great deal, but I was hoping for more specific
    suggestions, such as comments on individual glyphs. <BR> <BR>Anyway, here&#39;s

  body: 'i think it&#39;s great.  for the most part, the letters are top-heavy, and
    it makes the whole set look fun and quirky.  i like it a lot.  what about a small-caps
    set?  '

  body: Actually, Loren, you inspired me to do a LC set. Not exactly small caps, but
    maybe worth the effort... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14167.jpg"

    But I redid it and completed the &#40;basic 52&#41; character set. Thanks for
    the input! <BR> <BR>I really like the way it&#39;s evolving. Check it out: <BR>
