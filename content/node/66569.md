body: "I am looking for some clarity on best practice for the naming and use of UNICODE
  codes.\r\n\r\nWhen reading Typophile's informative posts, \"those who know\" prifix
  any quotation of a unicode to be assigned to a glyph with the prefix U+ giving a
  value like 'U+0000' (also as used in Adobe Glyph List) however when looking at font
  file from Apple and Adobe and accessing their UNICODE via >Rename Glyph in FontLab
  there is no U+ prefix there just the (4 alphanumerics). Also when clicking the magic
  Jewel in FontLab - no U+ appears.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nU+ certainly assists when compiling
  a spreadsheet so that the program doesn't automatically read as a number and delete
  preceeding zero in a code.\r\n\r\nAlso by prefixing a Unicode by U+ makes the communication
  of data in a forum clear and easy.\r\n\r\nQ. Does coding assignation break if the
  U+ is assigned in any or all cases in FonLab?\r\n\r\nQ. Is there a best practice.
  Is anyone suggesting to include the U+ when assigning Unicodes within font editing
  software?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael Hernan"

    that these are Unicode characters and not e.g. GB 18030 or some other encoding.
    Since the Unicode encoding field in the FontLab glyph properties dialogue is,
    by definition, Unicode, there is no need for the U+ prefix in this context, although
    I agree that it would be nice if a codepoint entered as U+0179 were recognised.\r\n\r\nIn
    spreadsheets, you can use the 0x prefix, which is recognised by FontLab, e.g.
    0x0179."

    boxes where glyphs are selected, you can use \\uXXXX or \\XXXX to denote a glyph
    which has a particular Unicode codepoint assigned. \r\n\r\nFor glyphnames, you
    can use uniXXXX for 4-digit Unicode codepoints and uXXXXX for 5-digit Unicode
    codepoints. "

  body: "@twardoch How about the transferring of data from a spreadsheet to FontLab?\r\n\r\nI
    am taking a long and convoluted approach at the moment - is there a better way?\r\n\r\nMy
    process now is:\r\nI can copy data from multiple columns and in a text editor
    I inset underscores and = to delimitate Tabs. (This prevents the creation of multiple
    glyph boxes for the same character).\r\n\r\n<code>LATIN_CAPITAL_LETTER_D_WITH_SMALL_LETTER_Z_WITH_CARON=Dzcaron=01C5</code>\r\n\r\nI
    create glyphs by 'Generate Glyphs' and inserting my list of strings (as above).\r\n\r\nThis
    gives me a chance to then sort out glyph by glyph in the >'Rename Glyph' window/panel,
    by cutting and pasting the various bits of info from the name field into the other
    fields.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if speadsheet data could automatically <code>pass</code>
    to separate glyphs with the codes and names going to the correct field without
    user intervention...\r\n\r\nAnother question would also be that do prefixes and
    postfixes allow for this in any way?"

    of the 0x prefix didn't seem to do anything?\r\n\r\nUsing uni prifix does populate
    the fields but kills the name of the glyph preceding the unicode. i.e the name
    of the glyph is replaced by <code>uni0179</code>\r\n\r\nThis puts me half way
    to an acceptable method but also defeats the whole point of being able to inset
    a name to a glyph.\r\n\r\nI have just noticed that where I have 3 bits of information:
    Written_Name Lettercode Unicode... the Generate Glyph proceedure noted above cuts
    off the first part (Written Name).\r\n\r\nThis is good as there are only 2 boxes,
    but surprising nonetheless.\r\n\r\nI will wait for wisdom..."
