body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_Z-300x300_3985.jpg]\r\nHi, I have searched
  and searched all day long for either the creator of this font/frame border, it's
  so extremely common and used by tons of crafters to create mostly vinyl decals for
  tiles or glass blocks. I desperately need to find it. Oh, btw, I'm not looking to
  know the font within the frame, just basically where can I find the whole thing.\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help!\r\nJen"
