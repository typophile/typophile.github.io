body: I&#39;m working on a sans serif face and I&#39;m planning to make a light and
  a bold version of it. I&#39;ve finished the regular and regular italic weights.
  Which weight do you recommend to do first? The light or bold? Is there any place
  with good tips for interpolation process on the web? <BR> <BR>Thank you

    <BR>Here&#39;s what I myself recommend: <BR>1&#41; Make a midling weight that
    looks good for text.  <BR>2&#41; Make a Bold &#34;candidate&#34; &#40;maybe using
    auto-weight-gain &#43; mucho tweaking&#41;.  <BR>3&#41; Extrapolate the lightest
    and darkest extremes.  <BR>4&#41; Clean up the extremes real good.  <BR>5&#41;
    Make new intermediates and compare against the originals.  <BR>6&#41; Tweak only
    the extremes to make any new intermediates come out good, dumping the original
    intermediates.  <BR> <BR>In this way you have clean results but you never have
    to tweak intermediates again. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: The easiest way, I think, would be to make the extremes, like light and black,
    make a MM axis out of this, pick the intermediate weights you want, and tweak
    them up. However it

  body: 'This is how I do it: <BR>1&#41; Prepare an ultralight &#40;maybe even stroke
    weight 0&#41; monochrome weight. <BR>2&#41; Extrapolate the extrabold. This will
    be too &#34;proportional&#34;, i.e. the stroke weight is constant, makeig a and
    e too bold. <BR>3&#41; Modify and clean up the extrabold. <BR>4&#41; Re-interpolate
    the regular wight. <BR>5&#41; Create an MM font with the &#34;true&#34; regular
    and the interpolated regular wight. <BR>6&#41; Extrapolate a &#34;triple true&#34;
    regular &#40;truer that true!&#41;. Now you can see what makes the true regular
    true and make conscious decisions about that. I think the most important thing
    with designing is that you do everything consciously. <BR>7&#41; clean up the
    triple true and re-interpolate the true regular. <BR> <BR>When I generate the
    final instances I put all three weights in one MM font. The semibold is not only
    an interpolation between regular and bold but I add a certain amount of extrapolation
    &#40;regular and light&#41;. <BR>The resaon for this is that a point does not
    move on a straight line on its way from light to bold &#40;that is why we need
    a true regular&#41;. However, it should not move on a line with a kink at the
    regular weight. It should move on a curve instead. So the semibold will not be
    on the direct line between regular and bold. <BR>I usually prepare an Excel diagram
    that shows the amounts of light, regular and bold in all the instances. Again,
    the graphs schould not have kinks. The semibold usually has about -10% of the
    light weight, 60% regular and 50% extrabold. <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR>Tim'

  body: As shown above, there are many ways to go about interpolating. <BR>My best
    advice is to try as many as you can and compare the results.  <BR> <BR>Maybe really
    obvious to some but &#40;I think&#41; a good trick is to create <BR>one interp
    for the caps and one for the lowercase and then combine <BR>them. This way you
    avoid the somewhat anemic interps that result <BR>when using light and black masters.
    I do this all the time. I even <BR>make a third sometimes for the numbers and
    a fourth for the fractions <BR>and punctuation. Of course, then the hand tuning
    begins.
