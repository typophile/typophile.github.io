  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m redeveloping a wayfinding system for this building: The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts ( <a href="http://www.pafa.org">http://www.pafa.org</a> ) as a school project. I need to research typefaces that would be appropriate for the building signage and figured this would be the best place to get that help!</p>
<p><cite>The building, designed by the Philadelphia firm of Frank Furness and George Hewitt, is generally considered to be primarily the work of Furness who finished the project after the partnership dissolved in 1875. Furness had been a pupil of Richard Morris Hunt who introduced him to the esthetics of the modern Gothic revival. This included John Ruskin&rsquo;s appreciation of the richly colored designs of 14th-century Venice, Owen Jones&rsquo;s and Christopher Dresser&rsquo;s Eastern influenced ornament, and Viollet le Duc&rsquo;s use of foliated decoration combined with cast-iron architecture.</cite>
<cite>Rising 70 feet above the sidewalk, the Academy must have seemed a towering fortress in 1876. Today, dwarfed by more recent buildings, it looks like a decorated jewelbox. On the facade, heavy courses of dark stone rise toward a roofline marked with such colorful elements as red and black brick patterning, fanciful floral motifs, and a bas-relief frieze depicting famous artists of the past. A gothic window dominates the central pavilion and creates a motif that recurs inside.</cite>
<cite>After entering through a low vaulted hall, the visitor steps into the spectacularly ornamented Grand Stairhall. Its staircase, bordered by richly tiled floor and walls, and bronze and mahogany banisters, sweeps upward to the gallery level. This grand space is ringed with gothic arches carrying gold rosette-studded walls. The vaulted ceiling above is painted a brilliant blue with silver stars. Beyond are the galleries where foliate columns support exposed steel beams, one of several radical design elements in the building.</cite>
<cite>The Academy is considered one of the finest surviving examples of Victorian Gothic architecture in America. It provides the museum with a magnificent setting for the presentation of its collections and special exhibitions. As the modernist architect Louis I. Kahn observed, the Academy is truly a life-giving and inspired building.</cite></p>
<p>The brunt of the info is located in the archives page: <a href="http://pafa.org/archive.jsp">http://pafa.org/archive.jsp</a></p>
<p>I have access to a fairly large selection of Studio Fonts (420 families) plus my own little archive that I&rsquo;ve started. I know it&rsquo;s going to be hard but I guess just suggest what you think would work and I&rsquo;ll try to find one that&rsquo;s hopefully similiar in quality with what I have. I don&rsquo;t suppose a foundry/designer might let me use a typeface for a specific educational project and then trash it.</p>
<p>Any help, including just pointing me in the right direction would be great.
Thanks fellow Typophiles.</p>

This last one would be of most use in large sizes, and the MyFonts sample doesn&rsquo;t show it (they don&rsquo;t sell it?). It&rsquo;s much more decorative and evocative, the others more subdued and utilitarian. The family together offers a very nice range for just such a project as yours.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">dave, my font suggestion was somewhat tongue-in-cheek due to your thread title. I&rsquo;m not sure what i&rsquo;d do for a victorian serif as my mind has victorian irrevocably tied to display faces. For a sans though I think that those great old [[grotesque|grotesques]] have a very victorian feel to me.

		<div class="commentbody">well the old grotesques, in my mind, always have that little waft of&hellip; well, grotesqueness. I find the imperfections of some of these old faces to be what gives them charm as opposed to something that&rsquo;s been completely polished up like Aksidenz. Something from our library that fits into this category would be <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/stgschrift.html">St. G Schrift</a>, although i&rsquo;m sure there are others that have the same kind of character.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Golden Cockerel is inappropriate &ndash; Renaissance, not Gothic.
Schrift is Jugendstil, much too late, as is Victorian Swash, although the Victorian Gothic might be OK in a secondary role (it&rsquo;s too thin for the lead)..</p>
<p>You really need a systematically fancy face to harmonize with the patterning in the building.</p>
<p>In this sample, you can see the highly formalized use of pattern that was a big part of Owen Jones' theory, so influential in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century. So I would imagine that any wayfinding system would, to be correct, have to have quite a substantial border, the design of which integrates with the typography. Why not take your cue from some feature of the decoration in the building?

<p>square serifs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I think of slab serifs as more of a commercial and advertising thing, and the Scotch as going more with the ornateness of Victorian archicture. But of course it depends on the building.</p>
<p>Some of the more ornate lettering like Nick showed would be great also, but it would be harder to get right.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Monticello is a Scotch roman. The others are. Miller (Font Bureau), also by Matthew Carter, is better than Georgia for these purposes, I suspect, because Georgia was designed for screen. You might also look at Goudy Modern, because of it being very American in feel it might go with the building.</p>
<p>Which one&ndash;Carter, Berlow, Highsmith, Goudy etc.&ndash;is best is just a matter of trying and seeing what pleases your eye in the context. I would think that taking photos and doing mock-ups with different styles would be one important step. Even better would be doing sample signs and taking them into the building&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice that you&rsquo;ve taken the plunge into incorporating decoration.
Tiffany is not authentic, in the sense that it&rsquo;s not a revival of any particular 19th century face.
However, as has been noted, type would not have been used at display size then, so the very idea of a printed Victorian display/signage typeface is spurious. (Except perhaps for the British cast-iron street name signs, recently revived by Device, but in a distressed version.)
So to use a genuine display face, an original design drawn c.1970 by Ed Benguiat, a designer with amazing chops in decorative type design, in a very sympatico neo-vicky style, is a brilliant choice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Nick. Means a lot coming from you with all your type experience. I did a lot of thinking and looking before I started the project regarding typefaces and gave up on finding &lsquo;an exact match&rsquo;. Instead I interpretted what I found research-wise and tried to put my own authentic spin on it. This was a school project as well and for that reason I couldn&rsquo;t go spend a great deal on a huge family. I&rsquo;m quite pleased with the results though and your comments are appreciated! Many thanks to Paul Hunt though, and the P22 foundry for the Victorian family as it was a solid foundation in all my designs.</div>

<p>I thought [[wood type]] was the original display typography, and correct me if i&rsquo;m wrong, but didn&rsquo;t it originate during the victorian era? I think tiffany works because the 70s were kind of a throwback to victorian style anyway. good job on your project, dave.</p>

<p>&hellip;in the context of this project, for signage.
They lacked the technology to make printed typography sufficiently durable (lamination, light-fast inks); also, there were sign painters on hand.
The closest they would have gotten is constructed frames where the printed signs would be protected by glass, and you can find such in old railway terminals still, for timetables, announcements, and advertisements.</p>
