body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nTrying to figure this one out, been searching around
  and not really getting anywhere with it. \r\nI tried Identifont, WhatTheFont!, and
  WhatFontIs identification without any luck so far. \r\n\r\nIt may actually be a
  custom typeface for it, but I would be surprised if so.. Maybe they used a simple
  font design, and just put the slant on the t, and the r? Thats my best guess.\r\n\r\nI
  edited the logo to make it easier to see, so see the image I am inserting..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burn
  notice font_4400.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut not only that, I noticed they use a nice smooth
  Rounded sans in the TV show as well. \r\nLike when they list people's names, and
  their title below it, there is a whole other typeface. That smooth rounded medium
  sans. \r\n\r\nIll try to find that font, for identification as well, that one is
  the really beautiful one. The Logo is separate. "

    this typeface to introduce people, and give a title. \r\n\r\nNow I edited this
    font, because it was the only one that had a photo, with the text from the show..
    \ So it was like a 300px, by 500px image so I had to do a lot of tweaking and
    removing  the background and tried to make it as usable as possible.  so forgive
    me its not the best, but picture the glyphs as completely rounded on the edges.
    COMPLETELY rounded. There was a bit of loss because it was a light background
    so it gives the appearance of not being completely rounded. \r\nBut I think it
    should be fine enough to see the specific things that make it stand out among
    others.. hopefully.. \r\n\r\nAgain I appologize, I did the best I could with a
    tiny 15px by 70 px text..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burnsubs_4320.jpg]"
