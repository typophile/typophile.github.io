  wordmark itself but he thinks the Y symbolises crossroads and splitting, not sharing
  and collaborating, which its meant to.\r\n\r\nHe would like to see maybe 4 nodes,
  one in the middle, but that would make the wordmark look crap.\r\n\r\nHow would
  you solve this? Ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Put the arrowhead at the bottom, so that the arrows come together.'
