body: "OK, here's a tough one. At least, it's tough for me.\r\n\r\nSay I have 50 pages
  of identical tables in Indesign. Each table has a few dozen cells, and I want to
  flow a giant block of text through specific cells through the whole document - for
  example, cells 1 > 2 > 10 > 11 > 20 > 24 > 29 on each page, linking from one page
  to the next.\r\n\r\nNow, I could do this pretty easily with plain old text boxes,
  but I have no idea how to flow text between cells in a table. Given IDCS2's great
  handling of tables, I imagine this may be possible.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    sitting down and getting my hands dirty with this right now, the only way I can
    think of doing this would be to set up the text originally as comma-delimited,
    convert it into one big table, and then break up the big table into smaller ones,
    and have one each on a page.  \r\n\r\nThere may be an easier way to do this, but
    I'm not sure how else to circumvent the \"plop info into specific cells\" requirement."

  body: I don't have time to find it, but I believe this is reminiscent of something
    that David and Anne-Marie talked about on a post in <a href="http://www.indesignsecrets.com">InDesign
    Secrets</a>. If I remember correctly, there is no way to link between cells. Take
    a look; they might have some solutions for your problem.

    work to do somthing that you could set up with text frames and a grid in the first
    place and not have to go through the table thing....  ;-)'

  body: "Tables are GREAT for forms - I mean, my form design work is 5x faster and
    twice as good (and much more consistent) since I started using frames.\r\n\r\nI
    think threaded text blocks on a grid are the way to go for this one. It will take
    less time to recreate the table as text blocks than it would to hand-enter the
    info. But yes, I've already made it comma-delimited.\r\n\r\nthanks everybody!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt

    this often, but I can see that it would save great swacks of time when I do.\r\n\r\nTiff,
    tables are great, but like everything else, there's a time and place for them.
    The trick (if there is one in design) is knowing when to use what, why, and how.\r\n\r\nIn
    that sense, \"design\" and \"editing\" are a lot alike: absorb and <em>become</em>
    the rules, and you'll know the rationale for violating them.  ;-)"
