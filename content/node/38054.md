  modern furniture.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was thinking of something explicitly design
  & modern. \r\nMaybe some kind of gotham thin, or a klavika, maybe even engel.\r\n\r\nBut
  I wanted to add strength to the brand.\r\n\r\nI fell on Giza.\r\n\r\nI love the
  great impact of this face, but now I'm stuck in the choice a typeface to go with
  it in the body copy, and I feel Giza would be difficult in a daily use.\r\n\r\nI
  'd love to share your thoughts\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm a Giza fan, too. Nick Shinn's <a href=http://shinntype.com/>Figgins</a>
    is based on the sans-serif font that Figgins (on whose Egyptian David Berlow based
    Giza) brought out, so that could be sympathetic or even be used instead of Giza.
    It's not out yet, but I believe it will be soon -- e-mail Nick if you're interested.\r\n\r\nIn
    the same vein as Figgins, I think a slightly idiosyncratic and 19th-century-feeling
    sans or serif might work nicely. <a href=http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-55-dynagrotesk>DynaGrotesk</a>,
    <a href=http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html>Maple</a>, <a
    href=http://www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php>National Grotesque</a> (soon-to-be-released),
    and <a href=http://ourtype.be/>Parry and Parry Grotesque</a> could be some really
    nice possibilities. And <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/bau.shtml>FF Bau</a>
    would be a 20th-century-style alternative."

  body: "Great recommendations, Reed. All of those would play very well with Giza.
    \r\n\r\nSince you're using a 19th-century face for the logo you might want to
    consider using something more modern to reflect the product. Perhaps a grotesque
    sans (like FF Bau) would be best. Or maybe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/\">Maquette</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/region/\">Region</a>,
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_ot/\">Proxima
    Nova</a>. Perhaps a modern gothic like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/primetype/ptl_skopex_gothic_complete_ot/\">Scopex</a>."

    I need as nice good looking discrete font. \r\n\r\nI've bought FF Bau a few months
    ago for another project,\r\nI must admit I would never have thought of using it
