  book covers published 1990-1994 by Bantam Books under their Spectra division. Credits
  say that the book designs were by Robin Hessel-Hoffmann. I'm not sure if they used
  the font for any other books, if it's a house font, or what. No luck with Whatthefont
  and Identifont.\r\n\r\nI isolated the titles only portions from two books for this
  sample:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/immora/Morewords_zpscf96be32.png\">\r\n\r\nThe
  attachments below: the top seven are from each of the actual paperback covers, and
  an additional font is visible in them. Note that the book's title (ex. \"DRAGON
  WING\") is not the same font as the serif style in the top blurb and author names...
  I'd be curious to know that font, but most interested in the one used in the actual
  titles. On the hardcover versions, they appear stretched horizontally compared to
  the paperbacks (not wider kerning/space between letters-- see 1DragonWing-HC-Flap
  and 3-FireSea-HC-Spine for what I mean) which is part of why I think it's a font
  and not drawn (plus the letters don't have variations as if hand-drawn).\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"
