  how should I put it... \"dumbed down\" from the one I remember seeing as a kid.
  This would be only about 25-30 years ago. The version I liked seemed to resemble
  Michelangleo a little bit, but of course had a lowercase version.\r\n\r\nSome of
  its features as I remember...\r\n\r\n\u2022 the lowercase e had a much more pronounced
  diagonal cutoff at its corner\r\n\u2022 the gooseneck on the numeral 1 was much
  more pronounced\r\n\u2022 the thin parts of the zero were roughly diagonal from
  each other; the zero in the present Palatino\u2122 has its thin parts almost vertical
  from each other\r\n\r\nI'm sure there were more differences, but... am I imagining
  things here? Can anyone shed some light on this?\r\n\r\nBy the way... I love this

    Palatino nova perfectly, and which I hope will cause quite a stir. But they are
    not finished yet, and they will be released later.\r\n\r\nI think that this is
    because Hermann Zapf sees Palatino nova as a family in and of itself\u2026 it
    is his definitive reworking of the entire Palatino family. D. Stempel AG advertised
    all of the Palatino products (Palatino, Aldus, Michelangelo, Sistina) as a complete,
    interrelated family, but subsequent conversions were never treated that way (i.e.,
    Palatino Linotype is great, but there is no Aldus whose metrics match Palatino
    Linotype's exactly, nor a Sistina, Michelangelo, etc.). All of the faces within
    Palatino nova are interchangeable\u2026 that hasn't been easy to get in print
    since the days of handset type.\r\n\r\nPalatino Sans & Palatino Sans Informal
    will be just as mixable and interchangeable, but aren't part of the Palatino nova
    family in the simplest sense. Sorry to disappoint ;-)"

  body: "Mike, \r\n\r\nMore to your question: Since Palatino was designed for metal
    setting in the 40's, it was manufactured in several sizes. Larger cuts, intended
    for display sizes, would probably have had the features you remember. The digital
    version available for years was based on drawings for a smaller size, hence the
    apparent coarseness. Even the original metal type at small sizes differs greatly
    from the first digital version (I'm looking at one of the first metal settings,
    Pen and Graver). I don't think Linotype is including any different size variants
    in the new release. I must disagree with Adam, I think some of the 'flair' of
    Palatino's display cuts has been lost. Proportions, shapes, details, and color
    are all different, but some of this may be format conversion issues.\r\n\r\nDan,
    any idea if other sizes of Palatino (besides Michelangelo and Sistina) might be
    revived? "

  body: "<em>>Dan, any idea if other sizes of Palatino (besides Michelangelo and Sistina)
    might be revived?</em>\r\n\r\nNo, Carl, I don't think so. Michelangelo and Sistina
    were uniquely-designed members of the overarching Palatino family\u2026 they weren't
    optical revisions for display printing\u2026 some of the letters differ radically
    in ways that don't seem to bear a direct relation to size and legibility\u2026
    they are meant to harmonize perfectly with Palatino text settings, but not be
    Palatino text (only larger).\r\n\r\nBut even taking this into account, I disgaree
    that Palatino nova doesn't cover size well. It doesn't have the dizzying array
    of variants found in Warnock, but it covers the bases that most designers will
    probably need. Aldus nova is particularly suited to book text (about 8\u201310
    points). Palatino nova Regular is a great all-around Roman, which does quite well
    in 10\u201312 points. Palatino nova Medium can also be set small too, depending
    on printing conditions and needs. Palatino nova Light is good for display purposes,
    as is Palatino nova Titling (which should be used big), and Palatino nova Imperial,
    which can be used big as well, but works great in smaller display sizes where
    Titling might come out too light.\r\n\r\nHermann Zapf is certainly not a stranger
    to legibility techniques used in metal composition sizing\u2026 I'm sure that
    he and Akira took optimal size performance into account in this version. The old
    \"flair\" of Palatino is certainly present in Palatino nova, it goes back to the
    original idea of Palatino, which was compromised in conversions to hot-metal and
    photo-typesetting machines."

  body: "The differences I remember, and see checking the luc site and comparing are
    the right-leaning A and the S and s that are unique--obviously influenced by black
    letter S. Also pointed out at the luc site are the lack of serif on p and q. also
    the jpq are shorter than the g. In the original digital version, and also the
    Optima Nova, the A and Ss are made more 'normal.' serifs given to the pq and EF;
    and the g also seems somewhat redrawn. Altogether the original has more 'moxie',
    though the revised version may well work better in text. It is a pity that the
    new version doesn't at least have the original characters as alternates, for display
    purposes. \r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if the original Michaelangelo and Sistina
    had the right leaning A and the quasi black letter S, but I am curious. \r\n\r\nHow
    much was this Zapf? I ask because I can't believe that he wanted the condensed
    version of Optima that is part of Optima Nova. It really is disappointing, and
    I am surprised that he approved it. \r\n\r\nI am interested to see the sans, especially
    because of my pet theory that the best sans and the best serifs never come from
    the same hand.  I'd be very happy to be refuted. In any case, coming from Zapf--if
    it really is from him!--it is bound to be very interesting, however successful. "
