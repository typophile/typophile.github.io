body: Psychological quiz for the day....Is the top sentence made from the same typeface
  (aka font) as the bottom sentence?...and if you think they are not, exactly what
  is the difference? And better yet, what is the top line typeface and what is the
  bottom line typeface? Winners will get some cyber bars of lead to pour their own
  type :) :) :)

  body: I noticed that the capital R is visibly different in the bottom row. Looking
    at some typefaces I have fonts for that resemble Times, I found that TITUS Cyberbit
    Basic has an R of that type. Which is derived from Bitstream's Cyberbit, so someone
    else already had the right answer.

  body: The bottom is indeed TITUS Cyberbit, and although it is derived from Bitstream
    Cyberbit, it is different, it has different leading etc and other differences.
    I have both the older Bitstream Cyberbit and the later TITUS Cyberbit, and TITUS
    is much better IMHO.

  body: All the letters of the two are notably different. Even the most similar-looking
    ones have slightly different stroke widths, or terminal angles, or terminal curves...

    body: I will post an example showing the 2 different versions, since after my
      image was inserted into the thread by someone, I can for some reason no longer
      attach images to a posting here, and the insert image command will not work...I
      will post a new thread with an attached image showing both Cyberbit versions
      at 24 point. There you can see the differences in how the type fills space....

  body: It is <a href="http://www.stixfonts.org/">STIX</a> general indeed, that comes
    installed with <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX 2012</a> (and I guess,
    more generally, texlive 2012) and that must thus satisfy the EULA requirements
    for that distribution.

    body: STIX is very close to TITUS Cyberbit, but the inner stroke of the small
      a is slightly thinner in STIX compared to Titus....one can only really tell
      at pretty large sizes though.

  body: "One way to see the difference is to put one letter on top of the other, transform
    to paths, and then combine. In this example, the red is STIX, the black is TITUS.
    After applying the combine, the common parts become white and what is left is
    the (symmetric) difference, that I made blue.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SymmDiff_6495.png]\r\n(Here
    I used InkScape)."

    colors. \r\n<img src=\"/files/titus-stix_5913.png\">\r\n\r\nThat way we can see
    where TITUS got more ink with respect to STIX and conversely."
