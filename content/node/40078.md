  before the apostrophe rather than placing an S after a letter... thanks"

  body: You use the standard apostrophe (not a backwards one), as in all cases in
    English where it indicates omitted letters. Many programs will automatically place
    a single opening quote (backwards apostrophe) at the beginning of a word, so you've
    got to manually correct this.

    simply when used as one.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the term inverted comma is that

  body: "The term \"inverted comma\" comes from the fact that in some fonts of metal
    type there was, in fact, no opening quote cut or cast. Instead, the compositor
    would indeed invert a comma and set that as the opening quote. Two of them for
    opening double quotation marks, closed with two apostrophes. \r\n\r\nA classic
    example of this can be seen in Eric Gill's <cite>Essay on Typography</cite>.\r\n\r\n--

  body: Interesting, Kent! Are the (cap heights of) letters always centered vertically
    on metal pieces of type? Wouldn't it have to be for this to work?

  body: "Craig -- As you surmise, the position of the baseline alignment relative
    to the overall cap height and ascender length influenced the relative alignment
    of the inverted comma with the apostrophe. If you look at the Gill example, you'll
    see that the practice had mixed results. \r\n\r\nI think that Gill's use in his
    essay (c. 1930) may have been intentionally anachronistic.\r\n\r\nI believe this
    [the actually inverted comma] was really only in active use during the period
    when the practice of using quotation marks was in its formative years. By the
    time the conventions we know today started to solidify, I think founders started
    casting actual marks, precisely because of the alignment issue you allude to.
    (This is a supposition on my part, not a researched fact.)\r\n\r\nI think cast
    opening quote marks were common well in advance of standardized baseline alignments
    (c. 1890s), but I could be mistaken. Might be an interesting topic to research
    a little more -- the relative timelines for the conventions of quotation marks
    against the provision of specifically cast opening quotation marks.\r\n\r\n--
