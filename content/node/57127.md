body: I think that the first two Adobe latin character set have the same characters
  of Windows and Mac default western encodings, but also adds another characters like
  the minus sign, the L with stroke (or L with slash), the estimated symbol and the
  litre symbol. Anyone knows why? I can figure some thought, but I'm specially intrigued
  by the L with stroke inclusion, since it seems that the languages that use it aren't
  supported by the sets, because them lacks another characters.

    character set, even though they weren't accessible by the standard Macintosh keyboard
    layout (don't know why).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The default Mac and Windows western encodings are not the same. And then
    Adobe had a mind of its own. So, Unicode was invented to reconciliate all of them.
    At this day and age, it's probably a bad idea to constrain yourself to one or
    another 256-byte character map.\r\n\r\nAs for \"why\", Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe
    are all three American firms, and were most likely just guessing which characters
    they had to include :-) The basic range of accented characters is quite random."

    by the sets, because them lacks another characters.</em>\r\n\r\nI would imagine
    that the people determining the basic Mac character set wanted to include enough
    bits and pieces to set every European Latin script language, and they almost*
    did. It was then up to the software designers to figure out how to utilize the
    components.\r\n\r\nThe reason that lslash and Lslash were included as precomposed
    glyphs would have been because there was no point in including just the \"slash
    accent\" by itself, as it only appears in these two characters, at different angles.
    \r\n\r\n*comma-below for Romanian and caron for d, l, and t in Slovak are missing--perhaps
    they thought a scaled and repositioned comma would suffice."

  body: I'm pretty sure that putting the Lslash and lslash (and several other characters)
    into the low ASCII locations in the Mac character set was not an Apple thing,
    but a hybrid encoding introduced by Fontographer to make it easier to create fonts
    that could be targeted to either Mac or Windows. The extra characters are from
    Windows ANSI and Adobe Standard Encoding that are not included in the basic Mac
    Roman character set. You won't see these characters included in any Apple developer
    docs showing the Mac Roman character set.

  body: And, Nick, I think you're right about the reasoning, except that it was the
    Adobe Standard Encoding that started including the Lslash and lslash, not Mac
    Roman.
