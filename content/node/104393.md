  body: "Yes a scan with some editing. Would take a lot of work to make it look crisp
    and finished at high resolution. This may be one of the ones that Dieter did himself,
    instead of \"improving\" a existing font. \r\nThe general style of ornamentation
    is from about the 1820's to 40's. The kind of thing Joseph Gill\xE9 would have
    done in Paris, or perhaps by a German designer of the era. Somewhat similar leaves
    are shown in Gray's 19th Century Ornamented Typefaces with the label \"German
    Text ornamented\" by Thorowgood, and the note \"copied from the German of the
    early thirties.\" \r\nWe have identified a digital source but know nothing about
    it.\r\nDon"

  body: The digitizing is very good - nice clean details - not too many points - a
    good job overall.
