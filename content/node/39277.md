body: Our graphics people have ads that are created from scratch in InDesign, with
  no character styles or paragraph styles applied (at least not intentionally). When
  placed on a template that we created for our daily newspaper pages (that have object
  styles, character styles and paragraph styles associated with it) the text in some
  (not all) of the ads that are placed loses attributes and defaults to 10 pt leading.
  Some times even the font is replaced to helvetica. When we check character styles,
  paragraph styles and object styles, it doesn't show that it has picked up one of
  the styles on the page. Has anyone run into this before? Can it be avoided? Thanks
  for the help.

    you (or the supplier of the ads) should create a print-ready PDF of the ads and
    insert that into your magazine layout instead."

  body: Thanks for the reply, these ads are all done in-house and stay in-house for
    our daily newspaper. We're trying to avoid the step of creating the pdf and dropping
    it on the page as such since oftentimes last minute changes are needed.

  body: "Just a guess: Did you check if \"basic character/paragraph/object style\"
    has been chosen on your machines? \r\nIt is safer to base character styles, paragraph
    styles and object styles on \"no character/paragraph/object style\" (visible via
    double click on the single style) than on \"basic character/paragraph/object style\",
    because the latter can be chosen different on each machine and nevertheless it's
    always named \"basic\". "

  body: "I don't get it. What do you place in the templates? Do you Copy&Paste text
    only, or multiple objects or even InDesign documents?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind there
    is no \"no paragraph style\". If you copy something from one machine to another,
    you may get different text settings because the preferences for \"basic paragraph
    style\" are different. Same is true for standard typeface, sizes and so on."

  body: I wonder why this feature is so hidden, because I can't think of any good
    reason to have it that way. Only if you're insolubly glued to use one font only
    for the rest of your life (default = basic is set to Times, 12 pt ... -- at least
    it's not Arial ...).
