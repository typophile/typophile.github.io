  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What are the best setups of opentype classes for working with diacritics and other modified letters?</p>
<p>My font has stylistic alternates and small caps. I&rsquo;m hoping for advice both on how to structure classes, and efficient ways to set them up.</p>
<p>Do you have a giant @diacritics class with all of those letters in a long list? (and a @diacriticals.smcp class to go with it)? Do you organize by key letter (@adiacritics, e.g.) and then list all those in the smcp code? Or can you have a class of classes?</p>
<p>Are there shortcuts for generating any of these classes?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I was working on the classes in Black Monday I did a copy/paste from the font window to Textedit, saved it to a text file, used this command:</p>
<p>tr &lsquo;/&rsquo; &lsquo;\n&rsquo; &lt; ./bmonday_encode.txt &gt; ./bmonday2.txt</p>
<p>to insert real line breaks, and this one:</p>
<p>sed -e s/$/.alt1/g bmonday_formatted.txt</p>
<p>to create my big alternate classes. This allowed me to deal with the classes in Textedit where I can use 14-point Verdana to spot any mistakes before I work them into Fontlab.</p>
<p>And remember, save your OpenType classes any time you edit them in Fontlab. You <em>will</em> accidentally use the evil class sorting button that deletes them at some point, so be ready.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you&rsquo;re talking about classes for layout features and not kerning (well, kerning is a layout feature, but you know what I mean), then a lot of it comes down to what makes the most sense for you as a font editor.</p>
<p>There is sense in setting up a big lowercase class, @LC = [a b c d &hellip;], and having a matching small caps class, @SC = [a.sc b.sc c.sc d.sc &hellip;]. Such classes could include all the accented characters. These classes could be fairly easy to manage with a visual editor like FontLab.</p>
<p>When it comes to some contextual substitutions, you might want a class of &ldquo;all letters&rdquo; for some particular contextual rule, so you could then make a &ldquo;class of classes&rdquo;: @LETTERS = [@LC @UC @SC].</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a text editor and a features file, you might eventually find, as I did, that editing large classes like this can be difficult. Complementary classes have to match 1-to-1, and if there&rsquo;s an error, you&rsquo;ll find yourself poring over long class definitions trying to find the error.</p>
<p>In practice, you can specify basic letter ranges in shorthand, e.g. [a-z], so this can help. But I&rsquo;ve found in some cases that it&rsquo;s helpful to see a list of single substitutions, e.g.</p>
<p>sub dollar by dollar.oldstyle;
sub cent by cent.oldstyle;</p>
<p>and so on. It&rsquo;s tempting to start by putting everything in classes, but it&rsquo;s not always the best solution.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suspect a lot depends on what font editing program you have.</p>
<p>I too use a text editor, but one that has numerous capabilities, such as a column mode, sorting, change to case, etc. I use Vedit, but it is out of date. EditPad Pro would be much better.</p>
<p>I can describe a couple things that I do, but this should be taken only a suggestion of how to think about things, not a recipe.</p>
<p>First, I write off an .afm file. It will have all the characters. On a PC, you can them use grep to search for all instance of, say, &ldquo;.sc&rdquo; in the afm file, and pipe them to another file. Working in that file, the columnar mode will quickly let you erase everything but the character names. Search &amp; replace the returns with a space, and you now have a row. Copy the row, and search &amp; delete the .sc (or .scmp or whatever). You now have a second row with the same order as the first. Copy that row, and apply a lower case&quot; routine to the third row.</p>
<p>You now have three rows, one with all the small cap characters, and matching rows with the caps &amp; lower case. Each to become a class. The only potential problem I&rsquo;m aware of is the dotted cap I and small cap &ldquo;I&rdquo; for Turkish. Likely you could come across others, in some languages. But since you started with only the small caps, the problems will be minimal.</p>
<p>A similar search of the .afm should work for you stylistic variants, which you will have named &ldquo;.alt&rdquo; or &ldquo;.alt01&rdquo; &ldquo;.alt02&rdquo; etc. A sort may not be needed, but a text editor that will do that can be handy.</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m making a few changes to a font, I trust myself to the new add glyph names to the end of the class row. If there are a lot of changes, I write off a new .afm &amp; do the construction work again. It doesn&rsquo;t take long.</p>
<p>I do something a bit different with the numbers; each kind of 0-9 has its own row. Then other thing also switched with numbers, (dollarsign, plus, minus, divide, etc. etc. for lining versus oldstyle) has it&rsquo;s own row, as does comma, period if I&rsquo;ve made ones up for tabular numbers. Here, the splitting into separate rows makes things easier when you have to find things (read: fix problems).</p>
<p>On purpose, I&rsquo;m not efficient with classes. I&rsquo;ll make more than are needed, so I as a human can find things &amp; work on them. For example, I make up separate classes for the features tnum, pnum, onum and lnum. Each feature having 2 classes e.g., &ndash; tnumb1 and tnumb2 as well as pnum1 and pnum2. The features programming doesn&rsquo;t need this &ndash; but it is easier for me as an older human being (so I claim) to keep track of things. A real programmer would likely object to this wastefulness, and if you&rsquo;re careful, you can use fewer classes &amp; maybe save some space in the file. Not my biggest problem.</p>
<p>But enough &ndash; if this is the sort of thing you&rsquo;re interested in, you get the idea. If not, sorry to waste your time.</p>
