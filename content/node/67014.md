  (just want to make sure it's not too close to anything that already exists) \u2014
  can anyone suggest some typefaces that are based on a circle? \r\n\r\nObviously
  there are faces like Avant Garde that are inspired by the perfect geometry of a
  circle, but can anyone think of more literal examples? A good friend of mine, Rick
  Banks, has digitised his own homage to Hoffman/Bayer in F37 Form (attached) that
  is as close as I can find.\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully received...\r\nThanks\r\nM"

    (especially with the character v) \u2014 I'm treating it purely as a headline
    font, just as you wouldn't set body copy in Crouwel's New Alphabet, you wouldn't
    with this!\r\n\r\nThe next task will be to find someone to digitise the final
    design \u2014\_but that's probably for another forum!\r\n\r\nM"

    about New Alphabet, 'it was never meant to be a typeface, just an experiment'!

    'Similar Fonts' they're almost all identical (particularly Soraya, 1970, and Circulus,
    1994), yet credited by different designers?! How does that work?"
