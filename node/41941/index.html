<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Well, it's been about 5 years since I've graduated college... I've been working for a company for 3 of those years. It's a nice company, government contractor in the private sector... I'm the sole creative energy in the entire office. Despite all this, there aren't a lot of creative opportunities, nor is there much in the way of position excel. A few other factors have come into play that have caused me to rethink my continued career path with this company. So, now I'm starting to think about what I need to do to move on and I'm hoping the creative brain trust of Typophile can lighten the dark road to a new job.
As of now, most of my work is either in some digital format or collecting dust in a few boxes. My only portfolio consists of design work from college only, and I haven't updated since getting this job. I've been trying to keep my resume information updated, but it's not really designed. I have a web address, but no content (my web skills are rather limited, and I'm afraid this will hinder my search.)
I'm considering a move as well. I'm currently in the heart of Pennsylvania, and after 3+ years I'm exhausted with it's resources. I have friends and family in Philadelphia, so as of now I'm really consider that as my major focal point when looking.
I'm hoping you guys can help me get organized and focus my attention on the important parts of what I'll need to begin my search and ultimately end it with a new job! </div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd focus first and foremost on the web site, resume, and business card. You need to be able to direct someone quickly to samples of your work, and all three of those are vital. Your physical portfolio - yes, you need to update that to show professional work. A lot of A.D.s (myself included when I was one) are not that interested in student work and will want to see what you've done since then. You should also create a digital portfolio, in pdf form, that you can send around, especially if the web site will take some time to get up and running.
In the meantime, until you've made the move, try to take on some freelance projects to keep your portfolio fresh and varied.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Focus on a good portfolio web site and resume. A physical portfolio is important, but if you interview well you can present good stuff on boards and talk your way around not having a fabulous book. If you want to move, start researching potential locations, salaries, and living costs. </div>
