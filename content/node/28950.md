    Typefaces. There is/was a digital version of this from Franklin Typefounders,
    I believe.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "Thanks for your help!  I tracked down a copy of McGrew's book over the
      weekend and took a copy of Colwell Handletter.  Everything matches up except
      for the capital A and the lowercase f.  Maybe this is what my instructor meant
      about \"keep going down that road\" when it came to Colwell.\r\n\r\nAny ideas
      about a font that looks like Colwell but has a different f?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF

  body: Gosh, it sounds like your professor is a tease. My version of Colwell has
    the f with the ball terminal like your Colwell sample, as does McKenna. I don't
    know that you'd find something closer.

    body: Maybe he put a different f in there just to throw me off. I'll have to ask
      him about it in class this week and see if I can get some more clues. Thanks
      for double checking my results!
