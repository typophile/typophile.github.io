  body: "I cannot tell about InDesign CS4's Indic capabilities but I have heard that
    SIL (http://www.sil.org ) developed a plugin for InDesign CS3 for Windows that
    uses the Microsoft Uniscribe library, which should give users of InDesign the
    ability to typeset using any complex script that Microsoft Windows supports. I
    am not sure about the public availability of the SIL plugin, though. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "You can probably tell from Thomas' comments that we're trying to figure out
    the best way to describe the support for what we're calling \"complex scripts\"
    in InDesign CS4. We spent a lot of effort integrating the glyph layout engine
    that is in the ME version of InDesign into the mainline product. The goal was
    to allow documents that were created in InDesign ME to be opened, viewed, printed,
    and edited in the non-ME version. We did not have time to figure out a user interface
    or to do as much testing of this separate engine as we would like. We consider
    it \"beta\" and we'll continue to improve this area as we move forward. That said,
    you can use scripting or template-style documents to access features for the correct
    composition of Arabic, Hebrew, Tamil, Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and more. Full cross-platform
    support of these writing script at the level we and our users demand is going
    to take more than one release. We're excited about the functionality that is under
    the hood and hope that this first step will allow our more cutting-edge users
    to do high-end design with these scripts.\r\neric"

    for download?\r\n\r\nI suspect the most obvious UI deficiency will be right-to-left
    text controls for Hebrew, Arabic, etc. Being able to set paragraph directionality
    is pretty critical for working with RTL scripts. A lot of other complex script
    support doesn't really need much dedicated UI, since so much is handled via input,
    layout engine and character properties."

  body: "The goal is that every version of InDesign should be able to set type in
    every writing system is different from the goal that every version of InDesign
    should offer full typographic support for every writing system. \r\n\r\nThe English
    and Middle East versions of InDesign allow you to do basic typesetting for East
    Asian (CJK) languages, but only the East Asian version gives you access to the
    full set of typographic features specific for those languages. \r\n\r\nBut until
    now, the English and the East Asian version of InDesign did not at all allow setting
    Arabic or Hebrew. I think Adobe is now changing that, but I'm not sure if their
    goal is to completely unify all the editions, including the advanced typographic
    features. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that they fear that this would make the user
    interface overly complex. (I imagine putting the East Asian, Middle East, Indic
    and European typographic controls would result in some serious complexity). \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    the site claims proper matra placement, but their images show imporperly placed
    reph characters in relation to ka. it seems that this plugin is performing glyph
    reordering and replacement, but not mark placement. but i can't be sure as i haven't

  body: Yes, IndicPlus is Windows only. They said they may do a Mac version if there's
    demand for it. I did ask them if it supported mark placement and they were a bit
    vague. I will check it (you can check yourself with the demo if you have Windows
    ID). But most of the Unicode Indic fonts I have seen don't use GPOS mark features
    anyway, just GSUB replacements.

    to enable the World-Ready paragraph composer, and had an experiment with some

    I viewed the same web page via Safari on OS X 10.4 and via Firefox on Windows

    The World-Ready paragraphs certainly join the Hindi/Devanagari letters much better,

  body: Chris, is the OS X Devanagari font an OpenType font or an AAT font? If it
    is an Apple system font, it probably contains AAT tables instead of OpenType tables.
    In that case, you would expect the World-Ready composer to correctly re-order
    Devanagari characters, but you wouldn't get all the refinements of conjunct forms,
    accurate mark positioning, etc. that rely on the OT GSUB and GPOS tables. Mangal
    is an OT font, so will perform better.

  body: The Devanagari bundled with Mac OS X is Monotype Devanagari (Devanagari MT).
    This is an AAT-font, not an OpenType font. And Mangal is not just *any* downloaded
    font, but the Devanagari system font for Windows (and is an OpenType font, as
    John mentions above).

  body: Today, I typeset a Hindi novel in InDesign CS4 Middle East edition. In the
    ME version, the World Ready text composer is available by default (since it is
    used for Arabic and Hebrew), so this version is easy to use for Devanagari. There
    is no Hindi dictionary support yet, and no hyphenation module, so one has to be
    careful to get good results and be prepared for some manual editing, but overall
    the World Ready composer seems to do a grand job with Devanagari OpenType fonts.
