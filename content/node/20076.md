  anyone could tell me if there is a font similar to the actual Animal Crossing one
  (top left hand corner of the following website), or if someone can recommend something
  similar?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\nThe website : <a href

      one looks pretty similar so unless someone comes up with something better, it'll
      be that one I'll be using ;)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
