body: "A fair number of the books we set signal a glottal stop with the \"apostrophe,\"
  or \"raised comma.\" Times past, you simply set an apostrophe (what is now U+2019
  in Unicode).\r\n\r\nBut Unicode allows for options. The U+2019 apostrophe/single
  close quote is paralleled in the Spacing Modifier range with U+02BC.  While occurring
  less often, this character/glyph difference is also paralleled by U+2018/U+02BB
  (turned comma) and U+201B/U+02BD (reversed apostrophe).\r\n\r\nIs there any consensus
  amongst linguists which are the correct or preferred characters?\r\n\r\nIn the same
  vein, in some orthographies we occasionally encounter an acute used as a spacing
  character, not an accent. (Cherokee, for example). Do linguists prefer U+02CA and
  view U+00B4 as a legacy character, or does it matter? \r\n\r\n[It matters to us
  because we use character composition routines in our text file conversion program
  that parallel the ccmp feature in OpenType fonts. It is always an issue whether
  or not to treat 0060, 00A8, 00AF, and 00B4 as combining accents or spacing characters.
  I think of them as \"legacy\" accents, others may not.] \r\n\r\nCuriously, most
  authors and editors, even at scholarly presses, leave these decsions to the typesetter.
  They draw a picture of what they want, and in the text files, use a code sequence
  rather than make any attempt to use the correct Unicode character. From an appearance
  point of view this doesn't matter -- the old \"if it looks right, it is right.\"
  However, further uses of final typesetting files are becoming common, so it would
  be nice to move toward some consensus. "

  body: "Regarding the apostrophe, I've lost count of how many different ways there
    are to encode/display glottal stops. On the basis that the spacing modifier range
    was specifically encoded for the purposes of phonetics, my recommendation is to
    use those characters where possible.\r\n\r\nRegarding the spacing acute, I would
    recommend using U+02CA, the combining modifier character, rather than U+00B4.
    I agree with your interpretation of the spacing accents in the 00 range as legacy
    characters. It should also be noted that these spacing accents have compatibility
    decompositions to space+mark, so there is the risk, albeit small, that in some
    normalisation situations these might be decomposed, which would affect spacing
    and kerning."
