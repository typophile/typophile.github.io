body: Hi there, this is my firts post in this nice and useful forum. I'm going to
  re-design a public company magazine. Now I'm using ITC Garamond for text and Franklin
  Gothic Extra Condensed for headline. I would go with Minion for text and Myriad
  Bold for headline. Feels like a good choice since they were both designed by Robert
  Slimbach. How about it? Thanks.

    and Myriad are appropriate for this project, or why ITC Garamond and Franklin
    Gothic are inappropriate. Address the intellectual and cultural connections between
    the magazine and the typefaces before you address the connections between the
    typefaces themselves."

  body: Besides the appropriateness of the typeface designs for the subject matter
    and tone of the magazine, you may want to consider having for the body type a
    slightly condensed design, particularly if you have relatively narrow fully justified
    columns of text. Minion is good in that regard, being a bit narrower than other
    similar typefaces; but of course it may not suit your subject.
