  body: That's really touching -- a great idea, well implemented, with a particularly
    suiting choice of font!

  body: "The impact is very effective, although I wonder what it will be like for
    the residents, presuming the intention is to leave the text in place? Or is this
    only temporary, for the opening?\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall effect is good, it
    strikes me as a pity, looking at the close-ups, that this is a typeface with single
    forms for each letter: seeing identical shapes repeated in close proximity undermines
    the apparent handwritten quality of the text and, hence, its individual personality."

  body: "It was a one-off, John, and won\u2019t be there forever. And <em>if only!</em>
    the LettError kidz had the sort of chops necessary to vary character shapes from
    position to position! <em>When</em> will these boys learn?\r\n\r\nWait.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I actually don\u2019t mind the phenomenon, which I think was cancelled out by
    the really well-considered size and positioning variations. Although legitimate
    calligraphy might also have been interesting, if unwieldy and expensive."
