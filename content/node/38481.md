  No idea. The body text looks like in the style of the Modern sans fonts like DIN
  but of course is not DIN. Here is the link\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=14I2nzxBacfE83eaueNDDYReY6WFQl\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think it is FF Din Medium. But, it has been horizontally scaled about 5%,
    and the tracking is really tight. I've set this in yellow, original sample in
    gray.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ffdinmed_3832.jpg]

  body: "yeap you were right it was DIN after all. The rounded style it a confussion
    because of the blur into the scanned page.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot to everybody for
    the good info and fast reply!\r\nSebastiao"
