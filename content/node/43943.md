  Edwardian Script Ampersand.  I'd like to find something that also has the really
  exaggerated swashes and light weight qualities of this as well as keeping with the
  \"expected\" look of the \"&\" as cited.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

  body: Did you try mixing the a and t. Or maybe 'and'. This &amp; loks like embellishment.
    Hehe.

    amp at first.

  body: This is a bit confusing because MyFonts shows <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/edwardian-script-itc/regular/win-t1/91373/character/0026/CP2/1/">this</a>
    as the default ampersand for Edwardian Script Regular, but the version of Edwardian
    Script that I have on my computer (I'm sure it came bundled with something by
    Microsoft) is actually what MyFonts refers to as Edwardian Script Alternate (but
    shows up in windows as Regular) and contains the ampersand which you show. Perhaps
    <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=426947&grab_id=0&page_id=7331&query=edwardian%20script&SCOPE=Fonts">the
    Pro version</a> sorts all this out?...

    what you mean by mixing the \"a\" and \"t\".  I'm looking for an \"and\" not a
    \"at\".\r\n\r\nLex- Great resource.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nPaul- Same issue on my
    PC."
