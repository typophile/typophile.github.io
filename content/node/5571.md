  body: Well this type has a kind of slight Cheltenham air to my eye, but fortunately
    it is way nicer. <BR> <BR>Check the weight of the stems in the lower case h, m
    and n. The lower case a looks big and the g small in relation to the other letters.
    Try a less shy &#34;t&#34;. <BR> <BR>Maybe it would not be a decent move, but
    it would certainly put some eyes in your type if you called it &#34;Not Cheltenham&#34;.

  body: What about &#39;lox&#39; - the font has a slightly fish oriented style to
    it. It&#39;s a tasty font so far.  I agree about the &#39;t&#39; it is a bit shy.
    I like the g but it seems out of place. What about a bigger bowl on top? Or maybe
    just a wider one? The k isn&#39;t completely convincing in it&#39;s current form.
    Not the way a-f are. Something about the binary &#39;this style on this side &amp;
    that style over here&#39; treatment of the legs seems too simple. Too formula.
    The v, x &amp; y also seem less finnished &amp; less beautiful than the others.
    I really like the font though &amp; I usually don&#39;t like scottish looking
    fonts like this - so I hope you keep refining it!
