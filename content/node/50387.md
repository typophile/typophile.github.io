  body: That would be [[http://www.freitag.ch/|Freitag]]. They make them out of repurposed
    truck tarps.

  body: "Yep it's the Zurich based company Freitag. I own one of these, very good
    quality, very \"hype\", though extremely overpriced imho. There is a spanish company
    which produces rip-off of these with the same technique (used truck parts), therefore
    doing unique bags also, for 1/4th of the Freitag price.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "As someone who comes from the Homeland of Freitag (everybody and their dog
    have one or more of these bags here): hell yeah they are cool. And pricey.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a bunch of companies doing a similar thing for a lot less money. In fact a
    Swiss supermarket, which is known to more or less creatively rip off all sorts
    of brand names, launched a very similar bag line called Donnerstag (\"Thursday\"
    as opposed to \"Friday\") a while ago. They had to stop selling them quite quickly
    though. :D\r\n\r\nWhat speaks for Freitag, though, (and no they don't pay me)
    is not only that it's a cool idea to make bags pretty much exclusively from recycled
    materials (apart from the tarps, the straps are made of recycled car safety belts,
    and the little rubber things that close off the seams on the edges of the tarps
    are recycled bicycle tubes). Also, they are virtually indestructible. They originated
    as bike messenger bags, so depending on the model they're huge, nice to carry,
    and pretty waterproof too.\r\n\r\nI have two, the large one (with a fat Helvetica
    on it) is about 9 years old and is very slowly beginning to wear thin on the corners
    (which just makes it look even more recycled), and I use it practically every
    day. The small one (with a fat Frutiger on it) is about 2 years old and practically
    looks like new (well except that they look kind of used from the beginning). So
    yeah, I would def recommend them, though of course I have no way of knowing if
    there may be other companies that offer comparable quality for a seriously lowered
    price."
