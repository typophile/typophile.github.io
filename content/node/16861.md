body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst of all I want to say I really love this site -
  been here for only a few days but I'm already hooked. :)\r\n\r\nI'm doing graphic
  design at KABK, The Hague; though I'm still in my first year (so everything is new
  and challenging) I'm sure type design will be one of my main interests. Certainly
  after running into Typophile.com...\r\n\r\nAs I have a M.A. in linguistics (syntax)
  I'm quite focused on the relation between language theory and type design. That
  sounds vague, and maybe it is; I wonder if there are people who have incorporated
  both perspectives on type and language (internal structure and external design)
  into one coherent vision.\r\n\r\nMore precisely spoken: does anyone know where I
  could find information about phonetic alphabets? I do not mean the regular versions
  of IPA but newly designed alphabets which provide a single symbol for every possible
  sound in spoken language.\r\n\r\n(mwah, does this tend to be a little formulaic?)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  hoping for some helpful response...\r\n\r\nRingo"

    body: "Very interesting points, Ringo and Norbert, \r\n\r\nI am an absolutely
      newbie in fontography though I have been interested all my life - and now need
      to learn a little. But I am an oldie in linguistics with an MA many years ago
      and more recently a PhD - with general interests in the acquisition of syntax
      and phonetics/phonology, and currently researching a British linguistic tradition
      which ran from the seventeenth century to the late nineteenth century and then
      got buried. \r\n\r\nIn a way which may interest you, Ringo, the last exponent
      of this tradition, Alexander Melville Bell, the father of Alexander Graham,
      had the idea of a phonetics notation based on an early version of distinction
      feature theory. In 1849 he dismissed what he called 'Romics' - the approach
      assumed by Passy and the other founders of the IPA in 1894 - as hardly worthy
      of discussion. Bell, like his seventeenth century predecessor William Holder,
      was interested in the isssue of universalism which you mention. I don't think
      that this stuff is on the net."

        about the Bell's phonetics notation. Very elegant; every symbol is, as you
        mentioned, a representation of a distinctive sound feature instead of representing
        a particular sound (which is a combination of features).\r\n\r\nA very analytical
        approach and quite logical in its looks. This seems to be more universal than
        IPA as it doesn't depend as much from Latin alphabet. (I doubt it does at
        all.)\r\n\r\nStill questioning the readability, however. :P"

  body: "Thanks, those are some interesting links!\r\n\r\nBy the way, it's not that
    I dislike IPA, I'm just looking for as many 'universal' alphabets as possible.
    IPA is a well-elaborated writing system trying to reach for every distinct sound
    of every human language; I wondered if there were more alphabets IPA-alike but
    with other roots.\r\n\r\nThose 'home-made' alphabets I saw, some of them are really
    nice; however, their readibility is near-zero. They're the esperantos of type
    design, sprung from idealism; or worse, made for the sake of the inventor only.\r\n\r\nActually,
    from my personal point of view, there should be an alphabet which is a synthesis
    of worldwide typography; that is to say, it's been build up from the best elements
    of all writing systems. An amalgamation of styles and traditions, recognizable
    rather than readable, eclectic but coherent, concrete and useful as a global 'logo-language'."

    I think such developments in language and written forms happen not through intentional
    design but more through the clash or melding of cultures (not only global, but
    societal) necessitated by commerce. Like the anglo-japanese-\"hi-tech\"-citypseak
    lingo and word forms in <a href=\"http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=2301\"
