  body: "If this is from a film (and especially an old film)\r\nthe possibilities
    are it's hand-made\r\nand it may not be available as a digital font.\r\n\r\nYou
    can look for something similar,\r\nlike e.g. <strong>Cluff Hmk Bold<strrong>\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the reply. It's not a handmade font. I found it on a t-shirt seen
    here:\r\n\r\nhttp://shop.mayberryworkshop.com/product/fin-city-black\r\n\r\nThe
    one you suggested is close. I might use that if I can't find the original. Thank
    you for your help."
