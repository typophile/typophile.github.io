  body: The title and authors are hand lettered, but the sub-title is a font. I'll
    try and see if I can identify it.

  body: It's <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?7LR">Alleycat</a>, but there
    are better fonts in this bouncy Latin genre, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=BT.122586.0.0">Sprocket</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PY.114295.0.2">Daddy-o Hip</a>.

    body: Thanks for the tip Stephen, those DO look better, but unfortunately, as
      I am setting this particular book in English, I have to match the original as
      best as possible.
