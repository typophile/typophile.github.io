  body: 'another question for anyone with a little more type savvy than myself...
    Would it be a sacrilege to ''shave'' the serifs off a typeface in a logo design?
    to form part of a concept for a barber shop? '

  body: 'gosh i feel a little out of my depth for that just yet! im still searching
    for the right typeface for the name ''BARNETT FAIR''. I was thinking of just giving
    the ''FAIR'' a shave but i need something where this will be fairly obvious. I''m
    contemplating a slab serif but im finding it difficult to find something really
    elegant and distinguished. I''ve tried the shaving with a Bodoni  or Glosa display
    but im not sure its convincing enough... '

    yourself? Logotypes are usually drawn from scratch."
