    Is it the same one? I haven&#39;t thought about how much it&#39;s worth to me,
    especially since I really haven&#39;t used it yet &#40;except to find out that
    Industria was not an original design&#41;. BTW, besides money &#40;not that I
    don&#39;t need it&#41;, and sexual favors &#40;ditto&#41;, what might you offer
    in exchange? <BR> <BR>hhp '
