body: "The layout I chose to redo in the computer out of my sketchbook is the \"Loyola
  Type\" assignment.  The concept I had behind this assignment when I did the sketch
  was to visually represent the enormous cultural and physical differences that exist
  between students at Loyola that make Loyola so unique.  In other words, with typography,
  I tried to represent the types of students you might find anywhere on campus.  \r\n\r\nWhen
  I brought the sketch into the computer initially, I knew that it wasn't anywhere
  near as good as it could be, but I wasn't sure how I was going to take it to the
  next level.  I decided to first try making a stylized image of the front of Loyola,
  since that is where this unique culture is found.  I didn't want the image to overpower
  the type (because of course, this is a typography assignment), so I made it slightly
  transparent.  \r\n\r\nI still had the problem, however, of making the actual type
  look interesting.  I did a little research (or at least, reference work) and decided
  to use Dada for my inspiration.  I think that Dada is so extremely different from
  all other movements in history, much like Loyola is very different from many other
  colleges in the world.  I used this idea to vary the style, font, direction, and
  sizes of letters to resemble the chaotic yet structured feel of Dada.  I think that
  my layout turned out a little more structured than most Dada layouts, but after
  all, I think the culture of Loyola is more structured than that in the time of Dada.\r\n\r\nOverall,
  I'm definitely happier with the computer version of my layout.  I think that the
  structure and the varying fonts makes it look more purposeful and professional then
  the sketchbook layout.  Although my concept behind both layouts was the same, I
  think that the computer layout is more effective in visually representing this concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: But wouldn't Beatrice Warde <a href="http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/ward.htm">say</a>
    that the most important function of typography is to communicate? This piece falls
    short in that regard - it doesn't say where to drop the money, or what will happen
    to the victim if I don't.

  body: I agree that it isn't perfectly designed and may not seem like it has a purpose,
    but we (my class and I) are still learning how to use the computer programs and
    what can actually be done when it comes to designing on the computer.  What can
    I say?  I'm sorry if you don't like it, but please understand that it is quite
    a learning process.  I definitely plan to redesign this piece again once I have
    a more clear idea of what I should do with it.  Thanks for your comments though!
