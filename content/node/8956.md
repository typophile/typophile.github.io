  body: Cheryl,  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not about money, it&#39;s about ethics. Being a
    student has nothing to do with it.  <BR> <BR>Try not to read these comments as
    lecture, but consider them as advice from those in the same profession you are
    aspiring to. Maybe you can raise the question with your instructors and spark
    a valauble discussion on this and other issues of professional practice.

  body: I appreciate advice, but what Yves wrote was obviously nothing more than an
    unnecessary rude comment. <BR> <BR>He didn&#39;t have to be so rude and sarcastic.
    <BR>I may have asked a naive question, but at least I was nice about it! Just
    because the answer may be obvious to you, does not warrant a reply in such a cocky,
    uptight manner.  <BR> <BR>

  body: This reminds me of a discussion a while back about whether fonts should come
    with different pricing for different types of users. <BR> <BR>I mean some programmes
    come with an educational license. Why shouldn&#39;t fonts have the same thing?
    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no reason why someone like Cheryl should have to pay the
    same amount as Nike for the use of a font. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s preventing the
    foundries from doing something like that? It might even break the vicious piracy
    cycle. Or would it make it even more rampant? <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Hi Cheryl, I profusely apologize for my seemingly kneejerk reaction, as it
    appears to have come across a lot ruder than I intended it to be. I did use to
    have a very unpleasant online personality, but I really try hard to better my
    life. Let&#39;s just say that I sometimes tend to forget that the absence of facial
    expression and tone of voice creates confusion quite often. Furthermore I didn&#39;t
    have a clue that you were a student/novice, so my first impression was that of
    someone coming into a jeweller&#39;s convention asking how/where they could steal
    some jewelry. Again, I&#39;m very sorry, and your comments hurt my feelings probably
    as much as my comment hurt yours. Point taken. <BR> <BR>Back on topic: besides
    the tips offered by Messrs. Nolan and Earls, may I be so bald &#40;!&#41; to point
    you to <a href="http://www.fontlover.com/"> Fontlover!.com</a> which links to
    a large number of websites which offer freeware/shareware fonts. Some of them
    are crap, some of them are quite good, not all of them have full character sets,
    but hey: they&#39;re free. I personally have extensively researched these sites
    and can guarantee you it <i>will</i> be worth your while. <BR> <BR>PS THX Hrant.
    It seems this time I was the &#34;grumpy old uncle&#34;... I&#39;ll never ever
    make that remark again. ;&#41;'

    I didn&#39;t even know about any of those, not that I can make use of any of them.
    :-&#40; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s gonna take me a while to read those two threads posted
    by Hrant and Scoles. They&#39;re really long, and I read really slow. On screen,
    anyway.

    or e-mail to a type vendor and explain your case if you&#39;re a student on a
    shoe-string budget. Being straightforward and asking nicely sometimes does wonders.
