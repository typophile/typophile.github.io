body: "I bolted upright in bed this morning to song of birds singing their heads off,
  they were eating breakfast from the feed I put out the night before... Inside my
  head - I could still see shapes from the sleep of the night before.\r\n\r\nThe shapes
  were letters - six of them - spelling the word SPARKS.\r\n\r\nAnd from the architecture
  which ran down either side of the letters I immediately recognized where these letters
  stood - they stood right straight down the middle of Sparks street mall - a venerable
  historic cobblestoned pedestrian street mall in Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe letters stood
  3-4 feet high, and had a substantial 3D volume to them - built of steel sheet and
  finished with a baked acrylic paint of bold primary or secondary colour. And each
  letter had it's own identity coming from the typeface it was of. And built with
  each letter is a two sided internally illuminated display panel which the stores
  of Sparks use to show off their stuff.\r\n\r\nThe letters were widely tracked running
  quite some length of Sparks.\r\n\r\nAll day long this friggin image nagged me -
  not unlike like thousands of images have done before - so what could I do but pick
  up the phone and call the Sparks street mall merchants association and get this
  thing off my mind... \r\n\r\nAfter a really clumsy intro I layed out my idea to
  the gal in charge - and she just loved it!!, wants to see thumbnail sketches with
  a brief description to present to her board at the end of the month. In fact - she
  says to me that the mall is looking for just such a fresh idea to construct now
  that they're tearing down what is.\r\n\r\nOkay... this thing now has my attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n...and
  my curiousity.\r\n\r\n\r\n___________\r\nHiro\r\n"

  body: "Hiroshige, thanks for posting that story. I loved it.\r\n\r\nSounds like
    a designers equivalent of Rinzai Zen enlightenment :)\r\n\r\nIt would be great
    to see what you give her to present at the board meeting and which fonts you propose.
    Any chance you could upload an image of your idea?\r\n\r\nMaybe each whole letter
    could be a display panel instead of just containing a rectangular screen.\r\n\r\nI
    really hope it works out.\r\n"
