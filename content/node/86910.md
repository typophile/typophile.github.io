    Obelysk Grotesk Regular</a>.\r\n\r\nPer the MyFonts description, \"Obelysk Grotesk
    was designed by the Lanston Drawing Office in the late 1980s.\r\n\r\nThis face
    is a reconstruction of Spire (1937) drawn by Sol Hess. The skeleton of Spire Roman
    stands with the serifs removed.\"\r\n\r\nFivos - Almost all of those Brendel fonts
    were ripoffs of existing fonts. Charmeur = Spire.\r\n\r\nWalter Brendel did have
    several original creations back in the 70's under the <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/TypeShop_Collection/'
    target='_blank'>TypeShop</a> moniker. <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/ef-typeshop/?PREFS_SET[ipp]=96'
    target='_blank'>Some are familiar</a> typefaces, even. Later, the Brendel company
    got into making and selling hundreds of clones of others' fonts."
