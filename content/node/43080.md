  OpenType in the domain name goes against the Microsoft trademark guidelines for
  OpenType.\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/opentype.mspx\r\n\r\nI
  wonder how long they will be able to keep that website going for.\r\n"

  body: "What about opentype.com forwarding to Monotype!? ;-)\r\n\r\nAll the top level
    domains for Opentype.something are taken. I guess the main reason for Microsoft
    to register such a trademark is, that no one else can do it.  I don't expect Microsoft
    to sue all of the domain owners."

  body: My personal opinion (which obviously doesn't match the official Microsoft
    position) is that if and when we ever legitimately need those domains (for example
    if there's an OpenType Consortium set up at some point) we won't have any problem
    getting them back. In the meantime I personally don't have a problem with MTI
    or Ralf looking after those domains, especially if they're using them to promote
    OpenType and type design in general.
