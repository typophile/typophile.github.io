  body: "Yeah - at first I thought it might be an early Nick Curtis freebie inspired
    by some old poster. Those obvious Revue characters, though, make it seem more
    like some really bad novice mishmash. Perhaps intended as a comic font?\r\n\r\n'Fancy'
    is being too kind, Francis."

  body: "Good call Ricardo. Revue seems to be an ancestor of these letters. Inferior
    to Revue, but not really all that bad. I have  seen worse adaptations.  The _h_
    is bizarre and does not fit the rest. I will at least give the wordmark marks
    for creativity.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Thank you everyone for your help. I used Revue, they have differences on Capital
    P and B. But it's the closest we can get, so It will be fine. I really do think
    that they have edited it as Ricardo have said so it will really look different.
    or they drew the other letters.
