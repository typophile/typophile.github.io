Could somebody tell me how do they format the quoted titles from other newspapers?

For example, in this article about Novak Đoković, take a look at how the formatted the headlines from <i>Observer</i> and <i>Independent on Sunday</i>?

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/02/the-third-man-8

Could you also take a look at the formating of A.M. and P.M.? They should both be in small caps, but the A in A.M. looks a bit bigger.</div>

I have no idea if the print edition of The New Yorker does things that way, and I rather hope that it doesn't.</div>

They are known as one of the most fastidious publications when it comes to grammar, style, and typography, for example, typesetting any abbreviations with less than 4 letters in normal capital letters and those with 4 or more in small caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Used to subscribe. I guess I am a semi-regular reader. The old issues I have available ATM  (2008–2011) set blockquotes smaller with tighter leading, and they set long acronyms a point or two smaller. Enough to make it look noticeably lighter than surrounding text. Although I would love to see the New Yorker use proper small caps, Caslon’s are way to small for acronyms. In that sence, dropping the font size is a less jarring solution. If they are as perfectionist as they say, the limit is six letters: UNICEF is faux SC, MSNBC is all cap. Newspaper headlines sit between double curly quotes, but in the same style and weight as the surrounding text. I don’t know if they changed this in the new redesign. The designer of their new text typeface, Williams Caslon (used to be Adobe Caslon, I believe) is a regular here. His name is William Berkson. He might know more. 

Edit: Five letter acronym PIIGS also faux SC, NYPD caps. Not so consistent.

So, the limit is six letters? Who says that?

Same goes for the A.M. and P.M. (the A appearing larger than the M is only an optical illusion), which is set in 16 px.

I was always taught to set acronyms in smaller sizes than the surrounding copy (not in small caps, just a point or two smaller), but I've never seen anyone set a quoted headline smaller than the surrounding text. It may just have been a tagging error.</div>

I was asking is there a typographic rule which says that you need to typeset newspaper headlines in lower text size.

Then I added the question about the number of letters in an abbreviation for it to be typeset in small caps.

I have no idea how kthomps5 thought I asked a question about Caslon, which I wasn't.

I have no idea why JamesM felt the need to point something out, to be helpful, but then ended up being very unhelpful and snarky. Why haven't you, James, posted a link? Why didn't you do a search?

I was merely pointing out that the quoted headline was in the same typeface as the surrounding text (and identified the typeface), but in a smaller point size. I also pointed out that the smaller size was most likely an error, which Michel Boyer confirmed.

The whole Caslon discussion was initiated by someone else, and the additional link I posted was a response to JamesM, not to you.

If you want a good guide to typography, Robert Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style" is your best resource, and it covers both the abbreviation/acronym question and the book/journal/article title typesetting question. You can find it at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

I suggest you make the investment in the book, for I wouldn't expect many answers to any of your future posts on this forum....

What are you talking about? I had posted ONE sentence in this discussion, mentioning that the New Yorker has been talked about previously and you might want to search for the previous discussion.

> Why haven't you, James, posted a link? Why didn't you do a search?

I was trying to be helpful and I thought the old discussion might be useful to you. Is it too much work for you — the person asking for info — to do a search? Geez.

>  kthomps5 said: I wouldn't expect many answers to any

Well, it was about typography in the New Yorker, so it had <em>some</em> relation to your question. Although I have to admit that if one Googles about how this kind of quoted material is handled typographically, what you will normally see is <em>italics</em> if not just quote marks... this is really the first time ever I have heard of anyone using a smaller type size for in-line quotations.

Quotes of whole paragraphs are a different matter - they may well be in a smaller point size in addition to being indented at both margins.</div>
