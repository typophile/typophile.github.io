body: I&#39;ve just finished the work of a type family for a client. The fonts are
  Reg, Italic, Nold and Bold Italic. <BR>Since I wanted to learn more about Fontlab,
  I did the the last kerning and hinting there. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m ready to generate,
  but there&#39;s so many encodings to choose from my head is spinning. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  a TrueType family and it should work for both Mac and PC. I used the Fontlab Standard
  Encoding &#40;in Name mode&#41; to be sure I didn&#39;t get any platform conflicts.  <BR>When
  I try to change to Unicode mode everything changes.  Which codepages should I choose?
  <BR> <BR>If I choose Mac Roman, which is the equalent PC encoding in Fontlab? I
  still need to keep the standard diacritic characters. <BR>

  body: I think Adobe Standard encoding is the safest bet. I only use that for Type
    1 fonts, but it should work for TT as well. The naming also has to be right for
    them to work cross-platform. <BR> <BR>Alan

  body: Thank you Alan.  <BR>Unfortunaly, with Adobe Standard Encoding I loose all
    the standard diacritics. <BR> <BR>I finally used MacOS Roman and MSWindows 1252
    Latin1. I&#39;ll loose some unimportant &#40;for the client&#41; characters but
    that&#39;s OK. <BR>

  body: That&#39;s odd. If you have them already designed, they should not be lost.
    Which version are you using?

  body: 4.5.1  - macOSX 10.2.4 <BR> <BR>If I choose Adobe Standard encoding some of
    the charcters aren marked with yellow anymore. <BR>I thought it was a sign of
    those charcters not being able to be used? Or am I wrong?  <BR>

  body: 'I think the grey bar above the character just means that it is outside the
    normal scope of the encoding, but they will still be included. It&#39;s true,
    if you create a new &#34;empty&#34; font and immediately switch it to Adobe Standard,
    those accented slots won&#39;t be there. But if they&#39;re already represented
    in your font file, they should export properly. <BR> <BR>My understanding is that
    that is the entire point of Adobe Standard encoding: to be cross-platform. It
    provides a basic set of characters that can be extended, without the font then
    being considered as &#34;custom&#34; encoding. <BR> <BR>Alan'
