body: Ok ... is there a rule for utilizing a logo that is created from a font in body
  copy? Should the logo be utilized if the body copy is in a different font? If not,
  how should that be handled?

  body: "The font that you use for the different applications in an identity program
    may or may not be the one on which the logo is based, if that's what you're asking.
    There is no standard practise in this regard.\r\n\r\nYou choose a typeface, to
    a large extent, based on it's affinity to the identity, but it doesn't have to
    be the same font. It just needs to be appropriate (and of course look good!)\r\n\r\nIn
    case you're asking how to use a logo as part of a sentence, the anwer is DO NOT.

  body: "I've worked with a variety of web products/companies, with lowercase or doublewordmashedtogether
    or splitCase logos.  My rules for the logo word(s) appearing in body text:\r\n\r\n-Do
    what's most legible\r\n-Avoid all lowercase unless pretention is an important
    part of the brand identity (in which case set it off using an alternate color)\r\n-To
    repeat what writingdesigning said - NEVER EVER use a logo as part of a sentence.
    \ Just stick with the font and style of the rest of the text."

  body: This reminds me of when we had 02 as a customer, and various people kept insisting
    that we needed to subscript the 2. It was a right pain when I wanted (needed?)
    to plonk the name in various Word fields based on a Custom Document Property (which
    is, of course, plain text). Grr.
