  body: Thanks, yes the numbers are quite unusual also. It has quite similar proportions
    to latin elongated aswell.

  body: "I suspect that the Q was designed that way to avoid needing to go much below
    the baseline. A typeface may have been used as a model but these letters could
    be entirely the work of the artist who did the plaque lettering.  Is the '2007'
    in the file name an indication of when this photo was taken, or when this plaque
    was made?  If the plaque is pre-digital, it begins to make the font question less
    probable, although many pre-digital typefaces have been digitized.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you know about the age of the plaque and the artist who did it?\r\n\r\n- Mike
    Yanega"

  body: "From what I could find on the web, the plaque seems to have been installed
    in 1982, fifty years after the mass trespass incident. That makes it (mostly)
    pre-digital. I could not learn who was the artist.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
