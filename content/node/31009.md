  body: There isn't an easy way to do this gradient in illustrator, but it's possible.
    You'll have to use the gradient mesh tool and create several small gradients that
    track around a circle.

  body: Or depending on the use you could just do it nice and large in Photoshop and
    place it. A gradient mesh will rasterize in a rip anyway.

  body: "Create two rectangles (one black one white). Create a blend between the two.
    Set the blend to smooth color and to align to path. Create an art brush out of
    the blend. apply the brush to a circle. Increase the stroke weight until a point
    is created at the center.\r\nLet me know if any of this doesn't make sense. I
    was able to recreate your example perfectly.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    using it for? I don't see the application.
