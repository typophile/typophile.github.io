  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Okay, so I thought this might be of interest to you all:</p>
<p>There is a book called Sign Painters that came out several months ago by Faythe Levine and Sam Macon. Faythe Levine was the one who made that documentary called Handmade Nation. They have also made a movie called Sign Painters as well and there will be a free screening at UCLA Fowler Museum on  July 25th (for folks living in Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura County). There are screenings in other cities of the world as well.</p>
<p>I have the book because I am in the Sign Painting program at Los Angeles Trade Technical College, which, by the way is the only college that teaches this lost and dying out trade. You learn all the old school techniques that only old Journeyman Sign Painters know, whom are very rare to find today. We learn the way proper letterforms should look, spacing, layout, painting in enamel, gold leaf gilding, water gilding, painting on glass, antiquing, vinyl signs, etc..</p>
<p>The book and film features my instructor Doc Guthrie and the sign painting program.  The class is great because it is SO intense and the variety of students that come in range in age, ethnicity, gender, and some people come all the way from different states and countries to take this program. It is considered &ldquo;L.A.&rsquo;s Best Kept Secret&rdquo;. There are many inner-city kids who take this class and change their lives around from being involved in graffiti, gangs, drugs, and violence, and become sign makers. The instructor Doc Guthrie really cares about teaching his students and making their lives better by
teaching them &ldquo;Life Skills&rdquo; as well as painting signs.</p>
<p>Anyway, in case any of you didn&rsquo;t know about this, you should definitely check it out!</p>
<p>There are screenings in different parts of the world so you should check out the blog and see if there&rsquo;s a screening in your town.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the Sign Painter&rsquo;s movie and book blog:

<p>And here is a link to a special that Tony Valdez had on the class recently on Fox 11 News:

<p>Hope you all enjoy and look forward to seeing many of you at the Sign Painters screening!</p>
