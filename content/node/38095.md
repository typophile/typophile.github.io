  body: Am I missing something at the Paul Barnes site? Am I supposed to be able to
    click somewhere on those columns of handlettered type? Is the "more" button supposed

    his works. I don\u2019t wanna deep-link, but the one is question is on position
    39. If you open one of the images in a new window (right-click), you know what
    to do to the URL."
