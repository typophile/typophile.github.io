  body: "Bryan\r\n\r\nI alway find it effective, when designing with Blackletter (or
    anything for that matter), to start out with the most rudimentary forms, get them
    situated (check readability/legibility!!!!!!!) and then add your nuances/embellishments.
    Mixing caps and lower case is going to make your job very difficult.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."
