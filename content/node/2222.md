body: Hi everydbody ! Could anyone give me help on identifying this typeface ? I&#39;m
  not sure wether it&#39;s a custom lettering or a specific face. The rounded shapes
  may also be due to tampography &#40;is that correct ? printing on a 3D object anyway&#41;
  Seems like it&#39;s an 19th century woodtype style. Several font search engines
  didn&#39;t work... Thanks a lot for help ! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21331.jpg"

  body: There&#39;s a very striking disparity between the &#39;O&#39;s and &#39;N&#39;s,
    but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just the sample you posted.

  body: I noticed it, but since the lined full caps logo are approximately the same
    weight, it might be part of a whole set. Maybe that stylistic disparity is part
    of the font !

    you posted there.  <BR>Next time maybe scale it to more wieldy dimensions. <BR>It&#39;s
    messing with the page width. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"

  body: "Hi szlobodan, I was looking for the typeface myself as well and discovered
    it looks a lot like the \u201DMarbrook\u201D. Needs a little customizing, but
    it will work.\r\n\r\nA very usefull site is: http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\r\n\r\nYou
    can upload a picture and the site automatically searches the typeface you're looking
    for!"
