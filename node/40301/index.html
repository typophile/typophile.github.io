  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,
I have seen references to having specific end of line forms, but am having no luck getting them to actually work in an application. The font I am working on has a lot of contextual substitutions. I&rsquo;m using FL5 and InDesign CS to test. In FL preview I can get both beginning and ending of WORD and LINE to work. In Indesign CS, The beginning of both line and word work fine, but only the end of word substitution works here. Is there a way for the end of line to be recognized in InDesign for this to work. My plan was to have end of line swashes substituted by more elaborate swashes using the ss00 feature, but obviously that won&rsquo;t work if the initial sub doesn&rsquo;t get placed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You need to be aware that OT does not know about anything like lines or words. All that can be checked is whether a glyph&rsquo;s context consists of certain other glyphs.</p>
<p>So, it is not possible to define <em>line</em> beginning/ending contexts. What is possible however is defining <em>word</em> beginning/ending with help of a trick: There is a word beginning/ending if no other letter (a b c &hellip;) precedes or follows it:

<p>This is using the calt feature as opposed to the cswh feature. I&rsquo;ve used both at times but still can&rsquo;t vary the results.
The word boundaries all work fine and the beginning of line recognizes the @All class and subs. I just can&rsquo;t get the end of line to work and get the end of word substitute instead.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Again, I cannot think of any reliable way to identify line boundaries in OT. The space character is not a reliable partner for these kinds of affairs.</p>
<p>At first I thought of a trick like this:
   (1) <em>ignore sub e' @letter; sub e' by e.wordend;</em>
All end-of-word e&rsquo;s are turned into wordend e&rsquo;s. This identifies word boundaries only by the fact that no letter follows. Forget about space.
   (2a) <em>ignore sub e.wordend' [space nbspace]; sub e.wordend' by e.lineend;</em>
If no space follows (= line end), e.wordend becomes e.lineend.
But this is not a good context since a line break may very well be preceded by a space &hellip; So we could try adjust (2a) a little:
   (2b) <em>ignore sub e.wordend' @space @letter; sub e.wordend' by e.lineend;</em>
Where @space = [space nbspace] and possible other space glyphs.
The application <em>may</em> include a line break character. If so, the ignore statement&rsquo;s context is not matched, and e.wordend substituted by e.lineend.
But this too may not be reliable because different applications behave differently as regards automatic line breaks. I found that in some applications contexts are broken if an automatic line break interferes (InDesign), while in other applications the automatic line break is treated as non-existing (Mellel). [Things may have changed. I tested this one or two years ago.] So you would not get the same result in all OT-savvy applications.
And as said above, space it not really reliable since applications may use another character than space or nbspace, which would break your context definitions.</p>
<p>My example code is speculative &ndash; I have not actually tested it.
And for the downsides mentioned I would suggest that you deal with word-end letters in calt as you do, but for line-end letters better do single substitution in aalt or an ssXX feature so designers would assign the feature to <em>individual</em> letters. As much as I like automatism, in this case it would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>P.S. And only in a third step (lookup) substitute e e' by e.alt.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Ralf and Karsten.
Since the only thing not working is the end of line glyph subs I might just set those up in one of the ss00 features as I have with other embellished letters. More work for the end user, but also more control on their end. I will probably have to reorder my stylistic sets around a bit, but its worth the trouble. I didn&rsquo;t realize InDesign would automate a space at the end. I knew there was a lot going on though so I even tried the substitution with right flush on and no luck. One of the threads here on Zaphino implied it could be done contextually. Also I think a pdf of Cezanne implies the same. Too bad. It was working so nicely in the FL OT preview.
If anyone else has experience with end of line substitution I&rsquo;d still love to hear how they work it. I do wonder if maybe too much automatic substitution might at times be working against the end user. thats probably fodder for another thread.
Thanks again.
