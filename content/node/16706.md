    Light</a>? Also has a lot in common with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antique-olive/">Antique

  body: It's <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/oneliner07.html">Forever</a> from
    Treacyfaces. Wish I had a better sample to show you. If you get in touch with
    Joe, ask him to resell through FontShop, Veer or MyFonts who can offer better
    web previews of his fine collection.

    body: Forever! I was thinking it was some new release font. Thank you Stephen.
      Interestingly, it's not available through MyFonts anymore. Maybe that's why
      WTF couldn't pick it?

  body: "There was a time when Joe sold many of his fonts through the Agfa Creative
    Alliance Partners, but no longer. I don't think any other resellers have carried
    the Treacyfaces fonts. Since we still can't post images in our replies (Aaarghhh!!),
    I could set up a page to show samples of Forever that came with the Creative Alliance
    Partners Library collection CD. Let me know if you want to see complete samples
    of selected fonts in the Forever family, which has two versions, eight weights
    of each and italics for all of them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
