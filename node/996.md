    done in the sports arena of type design, I am surprised anyone  <BR>with those
    interest cares about type. Forgive me for sounding like a typophile anti-sports
    psudo- intellectual designer, but really, who would rather sit around the TV and
    watch a bunch of <BR>middle aged men chew tobacco and throw balls when they instead
    could be playing with bezier curves. '

  body: ' I agree one should have multiple interest in life ...they should just not
    include baseball. I guess I am a bit sore on that issue as I live in Seattle where
    we just got a $655 mil stadium which the voters voted against twice. It is called
    Safeco Field after the insurance company that donated a few bucks and extorted
    the rest from citizens. To make things worse they build a new football stadium
    next to it at a similar cost. To bear the cost of these venues we the tax payers
    got taxed up the a&#42;&#42; for all kinds of things like 50c tax on all movies..etc.
    I would like to see type designers get 1/1000 of the wages some of these middle
    aged tobacco chewin&#39; <BR>mot&#42;&#42;&#42;f&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; get
    payed for throwing balls. '

  body: ' To defend my interest in type and seeming interest in sports, specifically
    baseball; I love type and I really don&#39;t get into sports at all. I do however,
    work at a screenprinting company that produces a lot of NCAA licensed apparel.
    In fact most of the designers I work with don&#39;t like sports, even though it&#39;s
    a major component of our business. Go figure. <BR> <BR>I am a little surprised
    with some of the judgemental/stereotypical respones. Who knew type geeks could
    be so catty! '

    used to be a sportswriter, among other things. Rotisserie baseball. Did that.
    I still listen to Rome and watch Sportscenter regularly. But MLB lost me as a
