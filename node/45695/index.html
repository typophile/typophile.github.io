<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I need some help with my personal identity logo - I know this is supposed to be the hardest thing for everyone, and I'm really feeling that. I've attached two file with a few variations I've done. I wanted to keep things simple, hence them all being text only, but if anyone has a striking idea I'd love to hear it. I'm kind of stumped. My initials aren't the easiest letterforms to combine.
Thanks for any input!
Oh, and the Feel Script one was just for fun, but I thought I would include it anyway.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The script version is the nicest of all of them.
Some suggestions:
• Try redrawing the flourishes to they balance out better (maybe even are the same on both sides)
• The starting point of the 'f' should begin within the vertical (i.e. the little hairline on the left could be eliminated)
• There's some unresolved space where the two letters join
Why was it "just for fun"? Does it not really reflect you? If it doesn't, then kill it. If you're into doing a monogram, then it should generally reflect the style of your work. Can you give us any more direction on why you tried these things?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all the input jonsel!
The Feel Script was for fun mostly because I hadn't even considered using something like that, though I do agree that the result is nicer than I achieved with any other so far. It does reflect me in some way (though not entirely), but I don't know if I'll ever feel completely at one with what I come up with because I am all over the place with what I do.
Generally I decided that I'd like to keep the monogram lowercase and keep it simple. As for the font choice, I really just went through my installed fonts looking for letterforms that I saw could combine nicely with a little bit of work. I spent a long time redrawing a Bodoni lowercase a and f together thinking it would look great, but in the end it just didn't look balanced or make much sense.</div>
