body: This is the business card for my studio Alchion Design Lab &#40;formerly Design
  Alchemy&#41;. Fonts used are Wedding Sans &#40;modified&#41; and Normetica &#40;modified&#41;.
  I did a set of old style numerals based on Wedding Sans, as well as new @ symbol
  based on my logo&#43; a few alternate characters. <BR>Color-Orange will be custom
  mix of flourecent and standard orange, this will be more vibrant that straight orange
  but not quite flourecent &#40;I have not done this type of tweak in orange yet,
  but it worked well last time I did this type of mix in yellow.  <BR>Paper is still
  a consideration- I like Yupo and well as Touch

  body: I have a similar logo &#40;the way it looks on my business card if you take
    off the 3d effect&#41; and layout for my personal identity. I like the simplicity.
    I don&#39;t think you need the web address since you have an email. It is obvious
    you have a domain and if people want to put out the effort to look you up they
    won&#39;t have a problem. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like the line between the icon
    and type. It feels uneccessary. A solution may be to make your icon black and
    alchion white. If you do decide to use a line make it go straight up. It is fighting
    with the icon being diagonal. <BR> <BR>I would like to &#34;design&#34; spread
    under Alchion to the exact width. It feels too small and since the type is leaning
    against the icon it seems justifying it to the right doesn&#39;t seem---right.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if any of these suggestions will work, I would just
    like to see more options.

  body: I think the diagonal looks pretty good the way it separates the icon from
    the address info, so I&#39;d keep it.

  body: I&#39;d suggest you move the &#39;Logo&#39; on the back for about one or two
    mm to the bottom ... it looks a little &#39;lighter&#39; than the text and therefore
    needs a stronger relation to the bottom. <BR> <BR>besides that i kinda like your
    design ... although it looks very &#39;techy&#39;

  body: I&#39;m with Tom on the diagonal line. <BR> <BR>Could you have the ole@ in
    one color and alchion.com in a different color? So that even the dimmest client
    could realize what your site was.

  body: Thanks for the advice. My intention with using the diagonal was  <BR>partial
    stylistic, and part practical. It seperates the information and serves as a &#34;loader&#34;
    on my site &#40;which is still in the works&#41; by sliding back and forths as
    information loads &#40;using flash&#41;. I am taking Tom&#39;s advice however
    and will post various versions later today showing color as being switched as
    well as the diagonal gone and straight. back on the diagonal topic, I have notices
    a few sites that use diagonals as shading and loading-example a inch or so of
    repeating small diagonal stripes even animated. When was this micro-trend started?

  body: I think the line would work if you made it entirely vertical.  <BR> <BR>I
    went to your website and I expected it to be more of the style of your card. Your
    card has a very clean tech feel and the website has so much going on with no definitive
    logo. I would make your card look more like your website with type going vertically
    and horizontaly, or make your website look like your card &#40;which I would prefer
    to see&#41; with a clean style. I know you aren&#39;t finished with it yet, but
    I just wanted to throw that out. <BR> <BR>One more thing- I see what you are doing
    with the corners of your card, making them the same shape that is in your logo.
    I think it may come off the viewers like the printer did a poor job of rounding
    the corners instead of noticing it has the same edges as the icon. I would just
    round them off. It will be cheaper also.

  body: Here is the first card mods. <BR>I find that when I make the &#34;Design Lab&#34;
    same width as  <BR>&#34;Alchion&#34; by inceasing letter size &#40;vs.spacing
    letter out&#41;, that they do not blend well together, the problem seems to lessen
    if the &#34;ALCHION&#34; type is lower in height. I have experimented with re-cutting
    the &#34;ALCHION&#34; letter to lower verticals and leaving horizontals intact
    &#40; a few optical adjust ments were made in the process as well&#41;. <BR><img

  body: Here are the 3 more versions. Most changes on these wereTom&#39;s suggestions.
    It is always good to experiment, and I think I have to say I still like the slanted
    line vs. the straight vertical.  <BR>Corners will be angular as shown as I have
    already ordered a  <BR>custom portfolio case to be fabricated with these angles.
    As for the printing. round is usually a lot less, but have mu sources and <BR>get
    the custom die very inexpensively. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69767.jpg"

  body: I prefer the asymetrical logotype, though I would align the left edge underneath
    the H in Alchion. And I would ditch the unicase. That lower case e and n are bugging
    me. See what an all caps DESIGN LAB looks like. I just don&#39;t like the discontinuity
    between the two N&#39;s.

  body: i really like the design. really good road you&#39;re on.  <BR> <BR>ok ...
    i&#39;m not a fan of your letterspacing ... i think &#34;alchion&#34; would need
    some fine retouching .. especially between the ALC ... the rest seems kinda fine.
    And I&#39;m really not sure about the design lab with incredibly spaced kerning.
    Especially not in the adresse and phone number like on one of the examples. Coz
    now it kinda looks like little non readable dots ....... maybe a little bigger
    type... or a different type....   but i would work on that ... <BR> <BR>And a
    last thing ... maybe it&#39;s my screen ... but i don&#39;t like the Orange color
    ... has too much magenta in it ... looks like a salmon color.

  body: "I like what you first posted the most.  I like the die cut, matches the mark.\r\n\r\nthe
    diagonal line works better due to how it relates with the mark.\r\n\r\ndon't letterspace
    DESIGN LAB under the logotype.  At least not for this one.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm right
    there with you on not needing the URL...I always try and talk my clients (at least
    some of them) out of using it if there's an email.\r\n\r\nI like the salmon, what's
    the pms?\r\n\r\nI second ecco's comments on the logotype.  Loosen the LC or tighten
    the AL.  Perhaps the logotype could use some more love.  You have some diagonal
    angles that aren't being incorporated into the letters.  \r\n\r\ngood work though.
    \ if tech modern is what you are aiming for, then bullseye to you"
