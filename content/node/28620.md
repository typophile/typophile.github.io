body: "Here is a logotype I have come up with for my wife's public relations business.
  She caters towards fashion clients, but also works with other industries. She wanted
  to avoid the look a lot of fashion pr firms have (a lot of Bodoni/Didot, or Futura,
  or on the other end, distressed fonts for edgier clients). She likes clean lines,
  likes Art Deco, wanted something gender neutral--not too girly. No sharp lines,
  as she read in a Feng Shui book that those are bad.\r\n\r\nThe name is \"son public
  relations.\" SON stands for \"Something Out of Nothing\" because our last name is
  Nix, which in Dutch (along with a few other languages, but my family is from Holland,
  so it's Dutch in this case) means \"nothing.\" So her clients are literally getting
  something out of nothing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I already pointed out to her that Something
  Out Of Nothing should be SOON, not SON. But she liked SON. Since I want to remain
  happily married, I let it go.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of tries, we settled on Estilo
  Script. Clean, Deco-inspired, curvy without being too feminine, and no sharp lines--rounded
  terminals even![img:sites/default/files/old-images/son_3654.jpg] This is a rough
  sketch with Illustrator optical kerning and me Frankensteining a swash from a capital
  N onto the lowercase n.\r\n\r\nAny comments? She expressly did not want a logo,
  just a logotype. Also, any suggestions for a companion serif face? I was thinking
  a modern, but didn't want something with so much contrast.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 10-18-2006\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/son2_6032.jpg]\r\nHere
  are some further concepts taking into account some of your concepts. I have layed
  them out on a 3.5x2 business card format to get a better perspective. I'm still
  not feeling the swash, and as much as I feel like I'm copping out of designing the
  logo, I like the way it looks \"straight out of the box\" on the bottom 2 samples."

  body: "Nice unique font I think it could work well, \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth,
    I think the text set all in a line like that is too much, with the diff. weights
    + frankenswash... it reads as a bit of a jumble.\r\n\r\nI think 'son' could cope
    really well on its own set in an olympic size swimming pool amount of white space
    (a small lonely word set like that might work with the somethiing from nothing
    theme) with a much smaller 'public relations' on the next line taking up a similar
    amount of horiz. space. \r\n\r\nDon't love the swash but I like the idea of introducing
    a bit of personality to the letterforms, perhaps a bit of irregularity/humanity
    could be nice.\r\n\r\ni know nothing about nothing,  but could public relations
    possibly be shortened to 'pr' and sprinkled somewhere around the dominant son?
    (sounds freudian).\r\n\r\nfor what it's worth,\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "I agree, although my emphasis would be on how to make that \"public relations\"
    text reads better.\r\n\r\nMaybe set 'pr' in all caps, firstly because it's an
    abbreviation, and secondly because that would contrast with the lowercase logotype.\r\n\r\nLOVE
    the white space idea."

    freespace around the wordmark.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be worth to play with the
    proportions between the SON and the public relations copy.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nwww.zwoelf.hu"

  body: "I think the swash is just a bit too much. Try cutting off the bottom of the
    's' and flipping it horizontally to create a smaller swash. I agree that \"public
    relations\" needs to be changed/removed so that \"son\" is more dominant.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I think the o in son needs to move to the right slightly, in the context
    of the other two letters I think the curve of the n at the top right comes too
    far down, I also think you can use a less vertical swash, angled from top left
    to bottom right, mirroring some of the s. The kerning in public relations is not
    helped by Illustrator, you could also try (if you don't want to go down the pr
    route) upping the weight a touch.\r\nTim"

    the concept. Using a single line with a black/grey break also imparts a degree
    of elegance the the other versions lack.'
