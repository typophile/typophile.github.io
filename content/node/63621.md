  to make it look folksy. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to use simple shapes to create a generic
  hat with a star on top. However, I don't think the fonts completely work. What do
  you all think?\r\n\r\nI'm using Giza and Gotham. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_gif_03_5329.gif]"

    button.\r\n\r\nI can't get past the folksy country vibe; it feels a bit too homegrown
    to be management. \"Folksy\" might be very unappealing to any musicians other
    than country. When I think of all the types of musicians out there - rock, punk,
    classical, orchestra, reggae, opera, jazz - it makes me seriously wonder if folksy
    is the best way to go. \r\n\r\nDoes this firm handle just one type of musician?"

    it looks a little big / maybe too thick.\r\n\r\nthe brim of the hat has a moon
    shape to it. maybe you can play with the negative space to have a moon + star
    make up your hat symbol. just an idea \u2014 might be too much."

  body: "Ya, I see the button now haha. Currently, they only have 2 artists and they
    create the same genre of music. \r\n\r\nIt needs to look somewhat corporate but
    appeal to music lovers. I think a plain \"big\" star might be too generic. I was
    thinking of piecing BSM together in the circle so that the negative space would
    create a star.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BigStar_Logo_03_4891.gif]"

  body: "When I think of top hat, I think of a magic wand too - which is performing
    + magic, not performing + music. But that is just my take.\r\n\r\nI would choose
    a different font for BIG STAR. \r\n\r\nWhen I think of \"Big Star\" I think of
    hopes and dreams of becoming a big star, and making it big, having your name in
    lights, glitz, broadway, etc. Not \"folksy\". So the title and the folksy font
    seem to conflict.\r\n\r\nCreative way to show a top hat though - I would keep
    pushing out more iterations to see what you come up with.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "The top hat feels like a strong mark, but it is a bit confusing. A top hat
    hints at Broadway or Charles Dickens - You could potentially go full-country:
    a cowboy hat with star conchas. Or use multiple logos ala typophile - a jazz fedora
    with a star on a playing card stuck in the hat band, or 80's metal hair with a
    star on the headband. \r\n\r\nWell, that's probably over-the-top. But you've got
    some fun leeway, that's for sure. "
