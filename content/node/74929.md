body: "Part of making my first text font was trying to make all the mistakes possible,
  so I could learn about what goes into making a complete typeface. One mistake was
  to get ahead of myself in creating glyphs, and I find myself making that mistake
  again- but I can't help adding alternates. I would like to iron out kinks in the
  glyphs before moving on- so any help- pointers etc. will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextTwoTest579_6547.gif]\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "A nice face! The quirks are generally quite appealing IMO.\r\nThe upper/lower
    terminals on /C/ and /c/ are opposite from what I'd expect, which is weird to
    my eye.\r\nThe curve of /t/ is a great idea, but perhaps could be done in a more
    subtle way so as not to jump out so much.\r\nMiddle vertex of /W/ seems unresolved.\r\n/Y/
    could use some rebalancing.\r\nTop of /a/ (the two-story one) looks a bit wimpy.\r\n/x/
    may be too narrow. Perhaps /X/ too.\r\nThis has a nice character to it, and it's
    well suited to going off with alternates as you've begun to do.\r\n"

  body: Thanks for your critique. You've given me a place to start work again. The
    /t/ was the first letter I drew. It is already much more subtle than the first
    few drafts, but I guess I knew in my heart that eventually it would have to be
    sacrificed.

  body: "Interesting start.\r\n\r\nSomething that bothers my eyes, but it doesn't
    mean I'm right :)\r\n\r\n/Y/ - looks like it's slanted to the left side.\r\n/K/
    - Leg seems to close to the stem. Maybe try to rotate it so it has more angle
    between stem and leg. Same goes for /R/.\r\n/k/ - Maybe it's too wide?\r\n/O/
    - Is maybe falling on the left side? \r\n/Q/ - same.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm more geometrical
    guy, but maybe you can try to make a couple of alternatives, another versions
    of some glyphs?"

    on /Y/ looking slanted and I second that for /3/.\r\n\r\nStick to this. I would
    love to see it finished.\r\n\r\n(Also I am making the same mistake with generating
    too much glyphs to early in the progress and having to change lots of them about
    5-10 times. I discovered that I can minimize this by starting early with different
    weights. So I see pretty early in the progress how some troublesome glyphs have
    to look like. Maybe this will help you too.)"

    trouble with.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextTwoTest580_4909.gif]\r\n\r\nNot
    sure you can see much difference, but I have done a lot of little tweaking. /c/C/
    is the biggest difference, and maybe the /O/Q/\r\n\r\nI'll add another update
    soon with a new PDF."

    (Can you tell I was typographically raised on the type specimen books of the '20s
    and '30s and The Fleuron!) \r\n\r\nI'm especially enamored of the ranging figures.
    Not many faces have them (I mean in proportion to those faces with non-ranging
    figures!) The old-face slant on the /e/ is also a particular love of mine. \r\n\r\nI
    prefer the wonky /t/ \"subtle-ized\". I just want the upper termination in /C/
    to match the one on the /G/.\r\n\r\nLook forward to your next display as pure
    eye-candy!\r\n\r\nClair"

  body: "I went with the more chisled 'C' and changed the 'G' to match. I've been
    wanting to keep a hand-wrought feel to the glyphs, but not too rough. Thanks for
    the criticism I've already recieved. Noted and acted on. More is welcome. So easy
    to become used to the faults and not see them anymore. Also easy to look back
    and have trouble seeing what difference the hours of work have made.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextTwoTest581_6289.gif]"

    saved you a lot of very minor revisions. I'm constantly amazed by how little my
    changes are visible- but yesterday I made minor but extensive updates that I feel
    really improved the overall colour. I still see problems everywhere- but I would
    be grateful for any critisism. Remembering that I am aiming at a hand-wrought
    but formal display face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextTwoTest582_5685.gif]"

    Z too wide?"
