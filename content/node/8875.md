  body: Hi Darren, <BR> <BR>Depending on your goal, it&#39;s difficult to comment
    on what you&#39;re doing. <BR> <BR>If you aim  to make a buck, you need only shop
    specimens to distribution outfits or put the fonts through MyFonts.com . . . <BR>
    <BR>If you aim to get hired as a font  designer, specimen sheets will help but
    any foundry would insist on reviewing the font files. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re asking
    what is the best way to set up a specimen sheet, I&#39;d say look through all
    the online photo  galleries from different type design shows like Typecon, TDC,
    etc. <BR> <BR>Many folks tend to emulate the House/Font Bureau formula of words
    in use as phrases at different scales along with a character showing to demonstrate
    the completeness of the font and consistency of the letterforms. <BR> <BR>Hope
    this helps refine your question somewhat . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
