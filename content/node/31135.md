  presume that, for general text work around the 10-11pt size, the 9 would be the
  one to go for?"

  body: Yes. The names are reminiscent of metal type sizes, but you don't have to
    take them literally. So Clifford 9 will work beautifully for text. Here's more

  body: 'Clifford *would* be fabulous if it were complete! I can''t use any text family
    that lacks bold and bold italic, except for display of course. And don''t tell
    me book designs don''t require bold someplace--they do! Why can''t these designers
    finish the job?? Requiem the same thing, although I''ve been told by staffers
    at H-FJ for years now that bold and bold italic are in the works. '
