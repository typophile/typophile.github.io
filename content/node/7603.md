body: 'I started this font a long time ago with some inspiration from the idea of
  the OCR fonts being able to be read by machines as well as humans. This idea placed
  several constraints on the design, such as being monospaced, and very simple. <BR>
  <BR>With time, I realized it was too constraining and that the font wanted to go
  somewhere else, so it was abandoned like so many other projects. Then, at the very
  beginning of this year I stumbled upon the Typophile forum, and became interested
  in finishing the font. <BR> <BR>This is what I have so far. It&#39;s changed from
  the original in having a larger x-height, but the imposition still remains that
  there be no curved lines and that the characters be as different from each other
  as possible. I&#39;m having trouble deciding the shape of some characters, such
  as the uppercase Q. Start the critique!<!--attachment: bucky-53172.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*58.2**bucky%2epdf

  body: 'I think your <b>e</b> and <b>z</b> - and one of your <b>a</b>&#39;s too,
    now that I look closer - are a bit close for the  <BR>as-different-as-possible
    constraint. I think one of the original goals of the OCR-A and OCR-B fonts  <BR>&#40;as
    well as a few others, such as most license plates&#41; is that you can&#39;t subtract
    small parts from one  <BR>character to get another, since scratched up, or badly
    photocopied, text may confuse the computer. I think that should be part of this
    design. <BR> <BR>For that matter, I notice that you have mulitple versions of
    some of the lower case letters: <b>a</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>g</b>,...  <BR>probably
    more if I went over it very carefully. Why the duplication? &#40;Not a critique,
    that. Just curious.&#41;'

  body: You&#39;re right about them being kind of similar. But even though the OCR
    fonts were in a way the inital inspiration, Bucky is not intended to be like that,
    I basically just took the idea of imposing some limits on the way things could
    be, so as to achieve a certain unity. <BR> <BR>How do you think they could be
    made less similar without breaking their identity? <BR> <BR>In regard to the different
    versions, well they&#39;re alternatives between which I can&#39;t seem to decide
    what&#39;s best. You can see all the alternatives in the PDF above.
