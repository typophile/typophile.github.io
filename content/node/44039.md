  to find a style that matched this exactly. Is this a font, or is it a custom jobby?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/holhlogo_3760.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    sign when I drive to work. Forgot which company uses it, now. Too bad there is
    no digital version. I think time has come for this one, too. Cheers!"
