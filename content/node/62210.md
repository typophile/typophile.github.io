    yummy!\r\n Check out all the swash stuff... buy the OpenType version. \r\nCheck
    out all the glyphs in the Pro version here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-kilkenny/regular/characters.html\r\n(You
    might have to wait a bit for all the characters to load.)"

  body: "Thanks John,\r\n\r\nI love Kilkenny, but its still not as ornamental as I
    require, I'm afraid. I need it to be total overkill, kind of like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NO_4977.gif]\r\n\r\n...
    or even more insane, if that's possible. I know a lot of this kind of lettering
    isn't digitized, so I've had a hard time finding what I need."

    are monograms but perhaps with a little doctoring you can get what you're looking
    for."

  body: 'I have an old book of letterpress type/ornaments with a lot of this stuff,
    including whole alphabets. There must be books in a library near you with this,
    perhaps a scan or a good photocopy would get you going? The original copyright
    would most likely be expired and if you set your own text with the letters (rather
    than reproducing a whole page of the book), you would (caveat: I''m not a lawyer,
    please check) not breach the publisher''s copyright on the book.'

    I wanted a reference point for a very embellished monogram. I still haven't found
    exactly what I'm looking for, but I think I'm going to turn to books with old
    type... I've found some beautiful stuff there."
