body: "For a while now I haven't followed the Type-ID section at all. One reason is
  that helps me spend less time on Typophile, but another is that I feel inadequate
  in the company of the planet's best font hounds! But I have noticed (through the
  [old] search facility) that some ID threads evolve into quite interesting discussions,
  ones I'd love to be exposed to. And I suspect a few others are in my position, so
  I have a suggestion:\r\n\r\nCould we have a Best of Type-ID compilation? It would
  include threads with juicy discussion but also exceptional cases of font sleuthing,
  and maybe great humor, etc. Assuming Yves is willing to spend <strong>any</strong>
  time on something like this, what would reduce his load a lot would be if people
  (especially the pack of alpha hounds*) nominated memorable threads, or even divvied
  up chronological chunks** of all the ID threads and went through them. It could
  be a long-term thing, as people have the time.\r\n\r\n* In fact one of the alphas
  could be the project kahuna instead of Yves.\r\n\r\n** You could give me a chunk
  too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> the first mention of the infamous Step Hen\r\n\r\nThat was me. But I think
    I intercapped it -\"StepHen\"- and that makes it harder to find? So maybe try
    searching on \"stephen\" + \"hhp\" from around 2.5 years ago. Or maybe it was
    \"Step-Hen\", since I love hyphens to much.\r\n\r\nMissing stuff: my guess is
    the system processed mine, then it needed a vacation. Seriously, I've noticed
    that posts from anonymous users for one seem to be missing; but that doesn't explain
    Stephen's missing stuff. Maybe it has to do with having multiple login accounts?
    I've always had this one, but I remember early on (like maybe 3.5 years ago) there
    was some sort of purge and most people created new accounts (thereby exagerating
    my [relative] post-count even more...) and maybe the system only revives posts
    of <strong>currently</strong> registered users?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
