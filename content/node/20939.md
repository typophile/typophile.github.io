body: "This is another puzzling font problem. I am trying to find the following, without
  success:\r\n\r\nAn OpenType version of Futura, or a typeface similar to Futura,
  that includes small caps, text figures (and possibly 3/4 height numerals), alternate
  characters as originally designed by Renner, and an italic/oblique.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  DTL Nobel and FB Nobel are only available as PS, and do not include the SC/OsF.\r\n\u2022
  FF Drescher Grotesk has OpenType, but I don't see any SC/OsF.\r\n\u2022 FF Super
  Grotesk is great, but no OpenType.\r\n\u2022 EF Futura Pro (via Veer) has everything,
  but there's no italic/oblique available(?)\r\n\u2022 URW Futura Pro (from Monotype,
  because the URW site is unusable) seems to have it all, except for some inexplicable
  reason the Small Caps are sold as a separate OpenType font.\r\n\r\nAm I missing
  something, or is there a huge, gaping hole in the 100,000+ font galaxy?\r\nPlease
  suggest some alternatives if you can think of any. I am going for the simplistic,
  engineered, geometric look of the normal weight and width of Futura, evocative of
  an unassuming, utilitarian time -- not the Big 80's 'Just Do It' crap, or Cingularesque
  Avenir look-alikes. If there is something slightly more exotic, \xE1 la Nobel or
  Super Grotesk, that would be even better."

    whatever Futura it is that you'll pick, make sure that it has uncompromised geometric
    features (e.g. a perfectly round \"O\"). Herr Spiekermann talked about this a
    year ago, I think."

  body: "Oops,\r\n\r\nI was speaking in context of Gill Sans' capital characters.
    Aren't they based roughly on classical proportion (unequal bowl on 'B' and such),
    which in itself was based on basic geometric forms? I find this fact to be the
    only similarity between Gill Sans and Futura -- hence my defense on its usage.\r\n\r\nHow
    different is their capital from Grotesk? Grotesk's character widths are more similar
    between each other and is, in a sense, less geometric.\r\n\r\nHave a look at this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geometric-humanist-grotesk_3698.png]\r\n\r\nFirst

  body: "That's weird, Futura seems to have more in common proportionally with the
    Roman caps (Trajan?) than Gill. Perhaps that explains why the Futura caps always
    set so nicely when letterspaced generously. I always perceived Gill's capitals
    as being more closely related to incised capitals, I believe he had some experience
    cutting letters into stone.\r\n\r\nJust noticed this came out:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/verlag/index.html\r\n\r\nSays
    it has something to do with the type on the 'Goog. I believe it was Nobel that
    was cited as the type on the outside of the structure, so this would be an improvement
    over the available versions of Nobel, as it has 3/4 height numerals and alternate
    characters. But unfortunately it has no small caps, and is slightly ovoid. I know
    this is basically a post to myself, but thought others might be interested in
    Verlag -- has all the genuine looks of circa 1950, but with the nice typographic
    touches of 2006. Except for the small caps thing."

  body: "Indeed.\r\n\r\nPaul Renner himself stated that Futura's capital was designed
    to be in proportion with its Roman counterpart. The thing that nobody notices
    is that Roman capitals <em>was</em> geometric in construction because it was built
    on Golden Proportion and such.\r\n\r\nSo a humanist sans that is based on Roman
    capital proportions should also, in some sense, be geometric. It seems counterintuitive,
    but there you go.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Mr. Gill was a stonecutter; and the
    example that I used -- Trajan -- was a rendition of stone inscription."

    the cap proportions were initially quite closely based on Trajan proportions.
    Of course, that still leaves some interesting questions: for instance, how you

  body: "\"how you handle really heavy weights\"\r\n\r\nI have the same issue with
    a not-so-geometric sans I have been working on.  The heavy weights don't allow
    for narrow and wide proportions in the same font with a monoline weight.  You
    either have to increase contrast as weight increases or widen the narrower letters
    to avoid plugging counters. The caps are the toughest glyphs to make work for
    me.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
