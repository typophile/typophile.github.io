body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I am new to this board.. well posting wise.. &#40;my first post!&#41;
  but i&#39;ve been reading it alot over the past few months. <BR> <BR>anyways, <BR>
  <BR> <BR>oh yes.. i posted this in the design forum because it seems that you cant
  make threads in the critique forum for some reason? <BR> <BR>currently im taking
  typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our current project is to design a
  27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face. of all faces I was given times
  new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people thought about this, or any
  suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured this place could help
  me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5 times, replacing the created
  character with a letter in a 5 letter word.  <BR> <BR>my current concerns pertain
  to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance down as the &#39;j&#39;
  ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking at the face, and i
  guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in the alphabet like the
  loop on the &#39;g&#39; my professor brought this up in critique tonight. <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Fascinating project! Your teacher is good. <BR>And Times is a great candidate:
    it&#39;s &#34;constructed&#34; but has good readability, plus it has all those
    funky IPA characters designed for it which you might look at. <BR> <BR>I see some
    problems with you proposed new character, but I think you need to back up and
    look deeper at the problem before going too far towards a solution. <BR> <BR>I
    would start with the &#34;Intro to Typeface Design 110&#34; under Courses on Typophile
    itself. It&#39;s a great &#34;formal&#34; aesthetic approach in understanding
    not just shapes, but their underlying structures. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s a world
    of richness beyond that exercise. There&#39;s the issue of spacing, where your
    new character is problematic &#40;it may hit a subsequent left-hand descender&#42;&#41;.
    There&#39;s the issue of what the/an alphabet <i>needs</i>: does it need a character
    that fits in more &#40;like the &#34;n&#34;&#41; or that diverges more &#40;like
    the binocular &#34;g&#34;&#41;? And does it need an x-height, ascending, or descending
    &#40;or both!&#41; character? <BR> <BR>&#42; It might help to decide if the new
    letter is a consonant or a vowel, or if it&#39;s just phonemically superflous
    &#40;like the &#34;c&#34;, &#34;q&#34; and &#34;x&#34; are already&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I would love to make concrete recommendations, but since this is about the
    process of learning, it&#39;s better if you try to answer questions like the above
    - the answers will draw out the solution from within you. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    I was working my way down manually, and I saw Drew&#39;s thread here first, <i>then</i>
    the other one with your post!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Since I think the Design section
    is a better place for this than Typography/Composition, just to streamline things
    here&#39;s Randy&#39;s post from the other thread: <BR> <BR>&#34; <BR>Hi Drew,  <BR>
    <BR>Let me be honest. I think the length of your decender is the  <BR>least of
    your problems! Sorry...  <BR> <BR>As a start at curing your letter of it&#39;s
    maladies, let me point  <BR>you to Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s course at typeophile
    that looks at  <BR>the very assignment you&#39;ve got: Type Design 110  <BR> <BR>Honestly,
    first check out what he&#39;s saying. What are the  <BR>characteristics of times
    roman? Given that, is the basic  <BR>stucture of the &#34;letter&#34; consistent
    with Times? How could it  <BR>be more Times-like in structure? Where is there
    evidence of  <BR>a pen? What angle is it held at? As a result, where are the  <BR>thick
    parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are the serifs?  <BR>Where does times roman
    break it&#39;s own rules?  <BR> <BR>Your glyph needs all these questions to be
    asked. Take a  <BR>look, and if you&#39;re still at a loss, I&#39;ll give you
    more specific,  <BR>practical pointers.  <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing the
    fruit of your studies!  <BR>&#34; <BR> <BR>BTW, I agree with what you said, except
    I would [predictably] caution against the &#34;pen&#34; approach. You&#39;ll note
    for example that Drew&#39;s glyph has one thick horizontal and one thin: depending
    on the &#34;structural context&#34; of the rest of the glyph, that might actually
    work best, irrespective of chirography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: thanks alot guys. <BR> <BR>I took a look at those tutorials. Honestly, I learned
    more looking at those than the 5 weeks into this semester of this class, however
    our first 2 projects involved just tracing letters at 5&#34; xheight in ink &#42;pefectly&#42;
    to appreciate differences in the forms. Then we did kerning. <BR> <BR>Attached
    are a few revisions. I started to think about how you would write it with a pen,
    and where the serifs should be. I am not sure how to determine whether it is balanced
    correctly? like, the counter space.. too big? small?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17873.gif"

  body: Ahh the thickness of the top right serif just caught my eye. To be consistent
    I guess it should be as thin as the serif in the inital glyph.

  body: The most odd part of your letter, Drew, is the hanging direction of your descender.
    It seems contrary to the flow of the latin alphabet. Isn&#39;t it supposed to
    be the 27th character for the latin alphabet? I agree with Hrant, that you were
    give a good type face to start with. Something with irregular serifs could&#39;ve
    caused many more problems.

  body: '&#62; the counter space.. too big? small? <BR> <BR>&#62; I guess it should
    be as thin as the serif in the inital glyph. <BR> <BR>Before you worry about the
    finish of the glyph, you have to figure out the structure of the character. Before
    you figure out the structure of the character, you have to figure out the essence
    of the letter. For one thing, in the Latin alphabet letters have two cases, and
    they&#39;re related. <BR> <BR>A letter is not a shape, it is an <i>idea</i>. <BR>The
    idea has to be solid before you can build a structure of it, and then build a
    shape on the structure. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>You&#39;re probably enthusiastic
    about the project in general, and what you&#39;ve done so far in particular, and
    enthusiasm is extremely important! But the end-result quality of the glyph depends
    most of all on developing a solid alphabetic foundation. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t polish
    a boat when you need to build a car.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>And what Randy
