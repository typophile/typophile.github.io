  I am in doubt of using or not the options present in the check box \"Create only
  pair with glyphs in these codepages/encodings\" because I do not fully understand
  how it works.\r\n\r\nDoes it filter the resulting kerning by checking if the resulting
  pairs are present or not in the languages covered by the chosen codepage or encoding?\r\n
  For a Mac OS Roman font, what options should I check? \"Current codepage in the
  Font Window\"?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\nRamiro."

    it does not check to see whether the characters are used in the same language.\r\nConsider
    Latin 1, which contains, for instance, ccedilla and lslash, which are used exclusively
    in French and Polish, respectively.\r\nIf you put a kern between c and l, and
    include ccedilla in your c kerning class, and lslash in your l kerning class,
    then your expanded kerning will include an entry for the ccedilla-lslash combination,
    although this never occurs in any language.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's my understanding
    of the situation.\r\n\r\nSome people have gone to the trouble of investigating
    real-language occurrence of character pairs, and using it to limit the number
    of kern pairs in their fonts. House Industries and Lucas de Groot, IIRC.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Ramiro, \r\n\r\nthe filter just limits the pairs to glyphs which are part
    of the selected encoding or codepage, i.e. pairs in which one of the glyphs is
    outside of the encoding or codepage that you select, are not created. \r\n\r\nA."
