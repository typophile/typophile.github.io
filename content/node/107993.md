    first-century Roman cursive letterforms that were quickly written in clay using
    a stylus\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/herculanum/\r\nThis seems to fulfill

title: I need to tattoo a phrase in Latin. The client wants the tattoo to be in original
  Latin handwriting, or the closest thing to it. Any font(s) that are in Latin alphabet?
  The phrase is "Aut Viam Inveniam Aut Faciam." Thanks
