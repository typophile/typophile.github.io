  body: "I've searched Dafonts 'Handwrtten' category, Part 14 of the Script Guide,
    Ronna Penner's (Typadelic) collection, Chank's GFY Handwrting fonts, and I started
    looking through the 'Handwriting' fonts at MyFonts. That's when I saw Font Garden
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontgarden/fg-matilda/\">Matilda</a> and
    some bells went off, but it was only 'close but no cigar'. I could almost see
    the same person doing our 'mystery font'. (However, this was the closest of the
    fonts by this designer (Ellinor Maria Rapp) shown at MyFonts, though several others
    showed this odd kind of 'R'.)\r\n\r\nI am sure I have tried finding this one before,
    and thought I got an answer, but now I am not sure if I only came up with a similar
    alternative, like 'Divine'. You know our FAQ statement about hand-printed fonts
    still applies. Maybe this ad designer had a custom font made. The approach is
    perfect for a 'signature' style. Maybe it was used in more than one ad, and that's
    where I saw it before? There comes a time when it seems pointless to keep hunting.
    Are we there Brett?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
