The circle seems forced and tacked on.  I don&rsquo;t mean to be mean-spirited or disgusting; this is just what I see.</p>
<p>As for your contention regarding design puzzles: some reveal themselves as &ldquo;a-ha!&rdquo;, others obfuscate with &ldquo;huh?&rdquo;, and still others repulse with &ldquo;what the hell?&rdquo;  If you&rsquo;re insistent that your designs are puzzles, then I&rsquo;m in between &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what the hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agree with the other posts, however, that your concepts (&ldquo;penn &amp; ink&rdquo; and &ldquo;plg&rdquo;) are brimming with expressive potential, and I am curious and excited to see what directions you develop as your research progresses.</p>

So I was looking for a &lsquo;P&rsquo; and an &lsquo;I&rsquo; but I found so much more. Now, when you said about your initials being PLG that made way more sense.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I thank each of you for your honest opinions. They&rsquo;ve helped me gain a better perspective on this. My favorite part was also the name; my name being Penn, it seemed to be the perfect name for my design company. Sadly, however, after doing a little research on the name, I came up with a few other conflicting organizations / companies.</p>
<ol>
<li>William Penn University&rsquo;s literary magazine is called Penn &amp; Ink <a href="http://www.wmpenn.edu/Academics/DivisionsAreasofStudy/Humanities/English/PennInk/tabid/161/Default.aspx">http://www.wmpenn.edu/Academics/DivisionsAreasofStudy/Humanities/English/PennInk/tabid/161/Default.aspx</a></li>
<li>There is a publishing company called Penn &amp; Ink publishing <a href="http://pennandinkpublishing.com/">http://pennandinkpublishing.com/</a></li>
<li>Pennandink.com is registered to Penn &amp; Ink communications <a href="http://pennandink.com/">http://pennandink.com/</a></li>
<li>Similarly, if you search on google penn and inc (note the inc not ink), there is another design site coming soon under that title. (Even if it is crappy design, it&rsquo;s still got a similar title and similar vocation as an organization) <a href="http://pnidesign.com/">http://pnidesign.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems my title is dead in the water. If you guys don&rsquo;t think that these companies are reason enough to give up the name, I have a question about domain names. I checked the domain: www.penn&amp;ink.com and nothing came up, but I&rsquo;m wondering if having an ampersand in a web address is possible. Is it?</p>
<p>Once again, thanks guys for all your help.</p>

<p>@Asvetic the problem with names like digitalpenn and pixelpenn is that there isn&rsquo;t really anything called a digital pen or a pixel pen . . . so the play on words is a bit weaker. I also like the &ldquo;old timey&rdquo; feel that penn&amp;ink has; it sits better with me than a more modern approach. All that said, I do appreciate your suggestion.

I like the idea behind the first attempt, but agree with some of the earlier posters.  However, I do like the color combination, without the blue.  The greyscale and chartreuse work for me.</p>
<p>Finally, I like where you are going with the cropped ampersand in the second set of images.  However, I would apply your earlier color scheme (without the blue.  if you need another color consider something else) and I&rsquo;m not sure about the circle.  It doesnt feel like it belongs to me.</p>

<p>I appreciate the comments you&rsquo;ve been making on color Katelynn. (I hope you don&rsquo;t mind I use your real name. Referring to you as tearsforsappho didn&rsquo;t seem right in the context.)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You get some really interesting shapes when cropping the ampersand. Just a thought - you could use different crops of the ampersand as secondary identity imagery. Back of the business cards - even different from card to card, watermark of the letterhead, back of the envelope&hellip;</p>
<p>Or even (and i know a lot of people will say you shouldn&rsquo;t do this, but i would definitely explore it)&hellip;. do it for your primary identity - keep the palette and text of your mark consistent but maybe the ampersand symbol could have different crops from piece to piece? Would give the whole identity a freshness and dynamic feel. You could even dump the ampersand from the logo and just use it as a secondary element.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts anyway</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I actually like your idea of playing around with the cropping of the ampersand. I&rsquo;ve always liked the idea of keeping either a mark or color palette consistent and then manipulating the other elements; like you said, it gives everything a much more dynamic feel and keeps people interested in the icon (which is always a good thing). The one thing to be careful of is changing too much too often so that it&rsquo;s not recognizable anymore.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about these crops of the ampersand is that they both contain traces of a &ldquo;P&rdquo; and an &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Both letters are perhaps a bit more visible when the ampersand is moved down and cropped like it was in the first set of the current color palette.</p>
<p>Thanks for the thoughts.</p>

I&rsquo;m having a bit of trouble picturing what it is you&rsquo;re suggesting I do with the &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; sign.

I&rsquo;m interested to know what you meant.</p>
<p>@bjharvey I&rsquo;ve always been interested in trying new types of pens and writing instruments, so naturally I&rsquo;m interested in your idea. Of those on that page that you linked, which would you recommend most?</p>

I didn’t see the traces of the letters “P” and “I” in the cropped ampersand. 
When you added this round shape (‘ball’, ‘dot’) to the ampersand, It conflicted in my opinion with the counter shape of the cropped ampersand.</p>
<p>What I meant was:
Make a connection between those two round shapes so you’ll get a black dot and a white dot (by changing the shape of the ampersand counter to be more round).
Lower the white dot a bit (in a diagonal line).
You can use this ampersand design in the name: Penn&amp;ink, but get rid of the dot above the letter “I” in ink.</p>

<p>and another one from a different site. (can&rsquo;t recall the site).</p>
<p>beyond ruling pens &hellip;.</p>
<p>there are dozens of great instruments that produce a variety of results, from brushes

<p>Some of the calligraphers here at Typophile (<a href="http://www.typophile.com/user/6065">Michael Clark</a> or <a href="http://www.typophile.com/user/14650">Stephen Rapp</a>) could probably give you more specific suggestions.</p>
<p>also, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/user/7730">Josh Scruggs</a> has an excellent <a href=" http://26symbols.com/?p=39">post</a> about a tool he made from Dr. Pepper can.</p>
<p>and finally, at most bookstores, there are great books on lettering and calligraphy, and quite a few of them come with tools and tutorials. It&rsquo;s a nice skill to develop.</p>

<p>I saw that you were considering changing the crop, and i really dont think you need to.  I like the vertical placement of the ampersand, and it think the positive and negative space work really well together in that sample.</p>
<p>As far as a pairing font, I&rsquo;d have to agree that a nice sans would be good.  After the strong contrast of Didot, it could be a nice place to rest your eyes.  I had just been on H&amp;F J&rsquo;s site, and saw that too!  Try it, see how it looks.</p>

Thanks for reminding me! I had forgotten that they suggested compatible fonts. I do like Gotham too, but unfortunately don&rsquo;t currently own it. Not sure if I&rsquo;m wanting to spend 100 bucks on it :) I think I&rsquo;ll look around for some similar fonts first.</p>

Thanks for your support and helpful comments.</p>

I&rsquo;m not exactly cropping the ampersand in order to form the P and I. It&rsquo;s more of a nice little detail or surprise that is hiding in the logo. It&rsquo;s not important to me that people spot them right away. Thanks for the concern.</p>

Thanks for all the font suggestions. I actually don&rsquo;t have either of those either (guess I need to beef up my font library). Maybe I&rsquo;ll just get Gotham . . . I&rsquo;ve been looking at it for a while now anyway.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few of the latest iterations too. I moved the larger crop of the ampersand, and standardized the location of &ldquo;penn&amp;ink&rdquo; in all of them (in case I decide to alternate crops). I also included a different color variation that maybe could be used with a gloss on paper. It&rsquo;s very light, I know, so it probably won&rsquo;t be my main identity. But I like it for secondary, almost subliminal, uses. (Inserting it in places where the reader/visitor won&rsquo;t necessarily <em>need</em> to see it.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Lex. But I&rsquo;d also try to use the same colour in the penn&amp;ink lettering for the ampersand as it is in the cropped version to connect the two. Just for an experiment. If it doesn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;d stick with the last version you posted and stop. Because it&rsquo;s already a finished logo. Much better than anything I&rsquo;ve seen for some time.</p>
