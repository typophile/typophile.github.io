    Unless you want another potentially huge deluge of information around the subject
    of subpixels, antialiasing, graphics libraries, and gameboy advance homebrewing
    etc. (which is already abundantly available courtesy of [[http://www.typophile.com/user/48230|John
    Haugeland]] over at [[http://www.typophile.com/node/61920|miha\u2019s flea\u2019s
    knees thread]]) I would suggest narrowing your focus. This sounds like a general
    request on the subject \u2013 which is totally valid \u2013 but please tell us
    more about the contexts in which you are interested.\r\n\r\n<cite>What file types
    support it?</cite>\r\n\r\nFor bitmap images, I can answer this unequivocally:
    any file type that supports color allows you to address subpixels. Also, the sharpest
    and most effective subpixel antialiasing/rendering is achieved at the border between
    pure white and pure black.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Leverette"

  body: "Matt, you said you understand the concept so I'll write how I started: When
    I made my first subpixel design last year (only one word), I took some screenshots
    of OS rendering of black text. I chose and saved five colors of red and five of
    blue, each ranging from the lightest to the darkest. I think I first made some
    diagonals for exercise :-) Designing with subpixels is similar to pixel art, consequently
    you use its strategies: for example, working with 32\xD7 magnification and looking
    on 1\xD7 scale opened in the other window at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"<cite>What
    file types support it?</cite>\"\r\nI just add a maybe obvious information that
    the format has to be lossless (PGN or GIF) and \"saved for web\".\r\n\r\n\"<cite>How
    do you render type or graphics accurately using subpixels?</cite>\"\r\nYou (or
    the viewer) has to have a LCD monitor, set in native resolution, with image displayed
    with 1\xD7 magnification. Monitor must not be used rotated and must have a RGB
    ordering of subpixels. According to Microsoft, a \"very small number\" of LCD
    screens use BRG ordering.\r\n\r\nSubpixel art is appropriate in the smallest sizes,
    because there you can be better than rasterisers!\r\n\r\nWilliam, a \"potentially
    huge deluge of information\" is certainly a possible danger in this thread. :-)"

    bitmaps to do this, you can use outlines. Just set the grid in your font design
    program to the number of pixels in the target font size, set the sample window
    of text to that size, and you are drawing outlines to a particular grid size,
    seeing the results live. And, you can reuse the outline for other sizes, other
    grids. http://fontbureau.com/test/franky/ is an example on a design far less tiny
    and interesting than Miha's. . . but you have to follow Miha's above instructions
    to see it correctly. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    change the rendering from Mac to Windows \u2026 and I was confused: when you change
    the rendering type the font is also changed, strange.\r\n\r\nDoing a handmade
    subpixel typeface for text at sizes such as 5 pixel x-height and maybe 4 is certainly
    not worth it. I am not sure for 3 pixel x-height, I didn't make any tests."

    into the page.\r\nSafari is probably the only browser you currently have installed
    that supports it.\r\nYou can also use: Firefox > 3.5.x, Opera 10, or Chrome with
    web fonts <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/2009/chrome-and-font-face-a-summary/\">enabled</a>.
    (Note: haven't tested the Franky page in any of these yet.)\r\n\r\nCheers, Rich"

    my understanding of your comment, you're saying that the division between the
    blue and red pixels (on an RGB LCD screen) is stronger than at other subpixel
    boundaries.  This also seems to be the case to me, but why is that?\r\n\r\nClearType
    and other similar subpixel rendering schemes seem to use the same low-pass filter
    that is applied to each color (and this is corroborated by everything I've read,
    including Platt's paper).  Here they seem to be ignoring any differences between
    divisions.  Could sharper rendering be achieved by somehow taking into account
    this division?\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nStephen\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@kentlew, simon, et al,\r\n\r\nYeah, I checked the Franky page against those
    browsers that support web fonts and both the font display and the JavaScript that
    does the switching is whacked.\r\nIE is a complete bomb because the fonts are
    TTF. In the others, either the Franky font doesn't display or the JavaScript switcher
    doesn't work.\r\nI'm sure it can be made to work cross-browser but the @font-face
    syntax needs re-doing, so does the JavaScript, and EOT files need to be created
    for IE.\r\nI think the Franky page is a really interesting exercise.\r\nIt's an
    interesting and clever solution to a very real problem. And there may be some
    way to consolidate the fonts into one file to create a more practical solution,
    who knows.\r\nI even volunteer to try and fix it.\r\nBut if the fonts involved
    are not free to download outside of browser display and manipulate as needed of
    course no can do.\r\n\r\n@mattmc\r\nI'm a little confused by this sub-pixel image
    thing. Is this a way to use a screen shot to make a sharper bitmap image of a
    font? In other words, to use the LCD screen's x-axis sub-pixel rendering to create
    better anti-aliasing?"
