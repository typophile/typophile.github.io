  body: "This seems to have similar features to your other post. First, this looks
    more sans-serif than serif, and it looks like these letters were placed by hand
    (see the way SAFETY doesn't fit right?). Again, this almost looks like some sort
    of stencil, or cut out lettering, but not really a digital font.\r\n\r\n- Mike
