    PS interpreters that are sometimes poorly translated).

  body: Thanks! Does anybody has more models to recommend? I am having problems getting
    real postcript laser printers in Amsterdam. I went to Mediamark (probably the
    best place in the area for electric appliances) and they only have a good range
    of economic laser printers with emulated postcript (mostly HP and  'Brother' printers).   :(

  body: Ricoh makes some good ones - I have the Aficio AP610N and it's very good.
    Prints up to 11 x 17 but I'm sure there are smaller models too. Xante has some
    too. Don't go with emulated postscript, you'll have problems.

  body: The HP laser I'm using has serious issues with postscript. Photoshop files
    placed within the document either show a darkened overlay with boundary hairlines
    or do not display on the printed page at all. Some illustrations of mine which
    have complex blends or gradient mesh will not always print correctly either. Colors
    are always off & calibration is an effort in futility. I'm going to check into
    Xerox & Ricoh models myself.

  body: I will mostly use the laserprinter for checking my font's outlines. What do
    you think about making a PDF and printing in a emulated postscript laserprinter?
    Some people has told me that I can get acceptable results that way...

    never bought a laser printer myself, so I can't personally make any good suggestions
    on where to go shopping. Maybe you can order one on the Internet?"

  body: "You aren't really saying what you are looking for. Great quality, cheapness,
    black & white only, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I needed a good replacement for my imagesetter
    years ago, because a few clients still liked pasteups - I couldn't find anything
    better than the 1200 dpi black & white printer from HP. I bought it a special
    paper, and those blacks were solid and crisp enough for a large camera that still
    shot for film to plates to pick up clearly. \r\n\r\nWhen I first looked for a
    color laser printer, they were almost all equal and not of very good quality.
    Two years ago, I splurged and bought a 1200 dpi Okidata (spent a fortune). I find
    it expense to own (you must buy 4 individual drums and 4 individual toners) but
    the quality is excellent. I tend to print out many an 11x17 poster for local shows
    with it -- and even the professional printers cannot get over the quality of the
    machine. (One even said it was as good as what came off his company's press, and
    he was in shock that it done off of someone's small business machine.)\r\n\r\nLaser
    printers have changed so much over the years - it is one area where the technology
    has paid off. Back in 1989, you could buy an Apple Laser printer with a whole
    300 dpi for $2700. Today, you can go to your local Staples/Office Depot shop,
    and pick up a superior machine for under $200.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to look at
    all your expenses. I have a small HP color laser. It does a nice job - allows
    me to use different DPI which does save on toner - but the toner is expensive
    and doesn't last that long.\r\n\r\nSorry to be rambling, but it really seems you
    have a lot more homework to do, before anyone can give you a suggestion for what
    it is you are looking for."

  body: "Get a laser printer with at least 1200 x 1200 dpi.\r\n\r\nAlso, the costs
    upfront for the printer and the toner will be offset by how many pages you get
    from each toner cartridge. I've had my Ricoh two years and only changed the cartridge
    once. It spits out 20 ppm which is pretty amazing. Inkjet printers on the other
    hand will really run you on the supplies. Laser printers last longer too."

    for an affordable B/W postcript laserprinter. More or less in the range of 500
    euros. I will use it for testing font outlines so I want something that can print
    acceptable contours (if I can get it with that money)."

  body: "Then patty has steered you in a correct direction. 1200 x 1200 is sharp (My
    LaserJest 5000 from HP was as good as any film/photographic paper typesetting
    equipment out there for a fraction of their cost.)\r\n\r\nMy only Ricoh experience
    was about 20 years ago with a copier machine -and it was great. They had use real
    glass grinded lenses rather than go the route Canon did putting plastic lenses
    in. \r\n\r\nPatty - toner is funny. I had one machine, like your, toner lasted
    for years. And then after the first change in toner, it just never lasted that
    long again.\r\n\r\nRamino - you are correct in getting a laser printer instead
    of inkjet. I recently (a year ago) went looking for a little new color laser printer
    -- and was amazed at all the machines available now. I was in a store named Staples,
    and was able to get samples from each machine I was interested in. The machines
    ranged from $99 dollars up to about $699. I don't know if you have the equivalent
    or even a Staples store where you are, but it's worth going to an office store
    and seeing what it available in person. \r\n\r\nI am partial to HP - because of
    low maintenance and high performance. But I seem to be using an Okidata as a work
    horse. We all like the machines we have, and you are very fortunate, there are
    many out there that can do the job, in all sorts of price ranges.\r\n\r\nMy best
    bargain - was a poster printer I bought at an on-line auction. Nope, not ebay.
    If I can find it again, I'll let you know - they only auctioned office equipment.
    Most of the printers were refurbished and warranteed -- made it worthwhile and
    good!"
