    from the foundry or a trusted shop like myfonts. You will not find tips on this
    board, how to check the authenticity of warez."

    fonts, a quick (although not foolproof) test would be to screen-capture ten or
    so signature characters and run them through MyFonts What The Font service, and
    see what hits you get.    '

  body: "typoaddict>Is there any program or procedure that provide me info on font
    originality?\r\n\r\nWe are working on a standard to provide you with a wealth
    of font information including that the original designer, or owner of the design,
    has permitted the font to be committed to the enclosed format, that the founder
    manufactured it with this permission and to whom the font was licensed. All of
    this would be signed, so you could know that it was the original and authentic
    version of this information, in the original font, or its approved derivative.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, this standard would allow for the original designer to provide recommendations
    for the best uses of the font.  \r\n\r\nDoes that help? Or is that a stupid answer
    to someone calling themselves, \"typoaddict\" ;) ?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
