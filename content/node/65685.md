  Pagemaker and need to use them on my new Windows 7 computer.  Need some help.  thanks\r\nThanks
  for the tips will try it again.\r\nPagemaker 6.5 runs fine in Vista, I have it installed
  on another machine.\r\nAlso, cannot uninstall CS3 without deactivationg it.  Cannot
  select deactivate since it will not run.  To remove it I have to delete everything
  and then delete all Adobe from registry to get it to reinstall.\r\nGetting Ultimate
  to put on, maybe that will let me run virtual machine.\r\nthanks for all the help."

    decade old - AFAIK it doesn't even run on Vista. In fact I'm working with a client
    to move them from PM6 to InDesign (and Unicode fonts), since they realize the
    tightrope they're walking on is getting thinner by the week... The tricky thing
    with them is that the Armenian hyphenation plug-in has to be re-written.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I suppose your best option is to install a virtual machine running XP (or
    downgrading the system entirely). Then preparing a transition, as suggested by
    Hrant.

  body: "There's an option in Windows 7 for setting the \"compatibility mode\" of
    an (older) application so as to help it run better under the new OS. Select the
    app icon (or a shortcut, even), right-click, get \"properties,\" go to the \"compatibility\"
    tab and look at your options. You could for example try setting compatibility
    to \"Windows XP\"....\r\n\r\nNo promises that this will help, but it's the one
    other thing to try (besides a virtual machine) before giving up.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Network Engineer and former 3rd level desktop support guy.)\r\n\r\n1) Try installing
    under the Administrator account. Even if your user account has Administrator privileges,
    I've seen problems. Makes no sense but such is Windows.\r\n\r\n2) Uninstall CS3.
    And then, find the msi or, more probably the exe intallation file, right click
    it, and select Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Run this program in compatibility
    mode for... and select Vista or XP or whatever.\r\n\r\nThis way, the whole installation
    gets done in backwards compatibility mode.\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, try it. If
    still no luck, add Thomas's step to the process and run the program executable
    in compatibility mode, too.\r\n\r\nrich"

    any and all anti-virus and security software.\r\n\r\n@thomas\r\n\r\n>nice tip\r\nMy
    wife had an app required by her school that just refused to install in Vista.
    The company flat-out said it wasn't Vista compatible and no update was on the
    way - not enough of a market, I suppose. Her entire class was going nuts over
    this. Everybody had Vista.\r\nInstalling in compatibility mode was a Hail Mary
    Pass, but Windows actually reached back and used older dll's and such and the
    sucker actually installed. Spent hours at it.\r\nAmazed me, I thought I'd seen
    it all. I wrote up directions and it worked on all the student's Vista machines
    so no fluke.\r\n\r\nrich"
