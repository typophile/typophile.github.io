    body: Both old and new glyphs are available as stylistic alternates. I don't yet
      have access to the font, but have I read that the new glyphs are available as
      stylistic set 20 (ss20).

    reversion in the I and Q to something far nearer to Frutiger's model. Nick, do
    you think that Segoe is a ripoff then?\r\n\r\nRiccardo, interested in why you
    think that 2 could be better than the original. Also interested in why the angle
    of the 4 could possibly be better concave versus convex or straight. \r\n\r\nN"

    but not many people would even call the bottom shape a counter or try to balance
    it. To me it looks grim. As for the /4/, I would have thought one wanted to open
    the counter up, not close it. I'm really not getting that at all, it certainly
    isn't convincing me it's straight (or not convex), that's crazy. Plus it looks
    so much wider than the other numerals :/\r\n\r\nNick, how many years must pass
    before one can \"swipe\" a design? Five, fifty, five hundred, never? Who decides?
    Why is a revival so much more acceptable? Isn't a revival a similar excuse for
    lack of originality/creativity masquerading as being the saviour of a design that
    would otherwise have been lost to us through the ruthlessness of natural selection?
    Maybe there's nothing new under the sun? After all, it's not like Segoe UI is
    traced from Frutiger. \r\n\r\nI quite like Segoe UI although the places I dislike
    it tend to be where it deviates from Frutiger the most so maybe it's not Segoe
    UI that I like at all! As for the morals of its existence, I'll happily let others
    be the judge."

    looking numbers! That the 2 looks less like a Z was purely coincidental :)
