  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the design Industry for a number of years but never really &lsquo;clicked&rsquo; (if you will) the whole dimension of what typography is about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stumbled on section dealing with typography in print and on the web in a book called Production for Graphic Designers. After that I was a bit curious to say the least. What really caught my attention was the part about Akzidenz Grotesk that was kind of revamped into Helvetica. The fact that I almost saw no difference even if it seemed to be a big deal made me curious, REALLY curious. What am I missing, what am I not seeing? I can see there is a difference but jeez - come on.</p>
<p>Right, so I went rummaging through my old University stuff for anything I could find dealing with type. There was very little. So, I headed for google and there are tons of stuff like, The best 25 Open Fonts, top 10 must have free fonts, 10 fonts that changed the shape of design etc. etc. But where is the really deep stuff, the stuff that will satisfy this relentless curiosity!
Damn it.</p>
<p>So now I am here. Are there any Typogrpahy obsessed people that might help enlighten me on what to look for. What I mean is: I&rsquo;ve fired up some software to start playing with some well known fonts to see what the hell these people are seeing. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t seem to wrap my head around what the big deal is. I want to, I really do. It&rsquo;s like looking at one of those old 3D images, you know the ones where you had to mess up the focus point of your eyes to see the image. Everyone is seeing the bloody things but you seem to stare at a mass of minute and irrelevant nonsense. Or so it feels.</p>
<p>Some of you might be shocked at the way a so-called designer seems to think how irrelevant type is. I don&rsquo;t, I understand it&rsquo;s importance but not to the depth and intensity some other designers do. And it&rsquo;s bothering me.</p>
<p>Some books I want to get (after a bit of google searching):</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking with Type</li>
<li>Complete Typography manual</li>
<li>Any other suggestions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe the whole typography world is a kind of a mental &lsquo;tuning in&rsquo; to get the best insight. Dunno, but the way typographers approach a font family is pretty scary. At the moment I feel like a colorblind guy tripping on Benzine.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re paying attention, so you will see it, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Arguably the most important way to look at type is, strangely enough,
what it&rsquo;s supposed to do! Convey text to the reading mind. It can get
inadvisably esoteric* but basically the shapes of the letters aren&rsquo;t
merely supposed to be pretty, they have to respect for example what
proportion of text has ascenders (parts above the x-line) versus
descenders (parts below the baseline) - causing Good text fonts to have
longer ascenders than descenders even though the latter in fact need
more room to look happy (especially the &ldquo;g&rdquo;). They also have to respect
what makes reading easier, for example not confounding &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;rn&rdquo; with &ldquo;m&rdquo;. Helvetica versus AG? The former&rsquo;s letterspacing is
too tight with respect to its vertical proportions, so it can&rsquo;t be used
properly at any point size for text as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Nevermind
that it&rsquo;s a sans font and serifs play a positive role in reading&hellip;</p>

I am primarily a book designer, not a type designer, and so the way I look at Type will be quite different than a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; type designer. But as such, I was surely impressed when I was asked to typeset a single dictionary page in Lexicon, for the publisher to take a look at and consider. Art! I didn&rsquo;t even have to help it!</div>

Great stuff! Very practical hands-on guides. Fontographer seems pretty good but I&rsquo;ve also found FontForge. Dunno if they are both geared toward different goals.</p>
<p>Shinn
Okay, I&rsquo;ll go for Stop stealing sheep. It seems to be pop-up everywhere. Thanks. Bringhurst’s style guide is very relevant since it seems I might be heading in that direction with a current cliënt.</p>
<p>frode
Maybe I have a strange way of going about something but I&rsquo;d first want to get some substantial background info before I start pulling beziers all over the place. ;)</p>
<p>hrant
You know, you&rsquo;ve kind of nailed the hammer on the head with the paragraph of yours. The stuff typographers see and take into account must be a enormous benefit! Honestly, I&rsquo;m beginning to get the feeling Graphic Design is 50% how you use fonts. Or maybe it&rsquo;s all about negative space - something I&rsquo;ve read a lot in connection about type last night.</p>
<p>Theunis
True. But at least balance, harmony and pattern are universally applicable. So as designers we should have inherent trait that helps us project those universal laws onto everything we see. Such as your page design!</p>
<p>Coles
Cool, thanks!</p>
