<p>Below is a spread I&rsquo;d like to include in my book. The topic here is retro costume influences. I&rsquo;d like to refer to the silent film era and the Art Nouveau classics of Mucha. How do I find out if I&rsquo;m allowed to use these 100-year-old images?</p>
<p>On the left is an image of an obscure (in this country) silent film star with the look I wanted. I found the high-res image posted on a Flickr site that was an homage to the era. I asked the owner where this image came from, if it was copyrighted, and could I print it. Got no response, which makes me wonder if it IS copyrighted.</p>
<p>On the right are Mucha art images I&rsquo;ve seen on several websites, but will printing them high-res (in black and white) get me into trouble with the Mucha Museum, for instance?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Anything pre-1927 has passed into the public domain. After 1927 things get messy depending on what country you’re in, what country the item was created/copyrighted in, and whether or not the copyrights have been renewed over the years. But there’s a nasty catch—reproductions of the images are copyrighted. For example, you can’t just scan a photo out of a book to reproduce without permission; you would need to photograph or scan a work yourself.</p>
<p>I would be very careful about reprinting the images from Flickr. Sure they might be posted by someone scanning his antique photos, but they could also be Corbis stock photos that got posted to the internet. If you really need to use them and can’t get clear copies, consult a copyright lawyer before you print them. As for the Mucha images, contact the museum; most museums will sell you their images for very reasonable fees that they very much deserve given the cost and effort of preserving and photographing.</p>

<p>Might I add my personal experience with this: most (so far, all!) musea are used to this kind of requests, and will promptly send you an incredibly high quality scan or photograph. It&rsquo;s always a joy to see something like that popping into my mail box &ndash; I always zoom in on every tiny detail, to really appreciate individual brush strokes from up close. Not something you could pull off in a museum, peering over paintings with a huge magnifier.</p>

<p>My book should be ready to go about 2 weeks before that date, should I worry? Maybe not! Especially since they are black &amp; white, only 2 inches high.</p>
<p>The film star is not one of the well-known Hollywood names like Theda Bara. She is Russian, and I haven&rsquo;t found that picture anywhere on the Internet except that one Flickr page. I wonder: if I posterize the image, would it be diffent enough from the original to not even count. Consult a copyright lawyer? I would rather delete the image from the page, it&rsquo;s not crucial.</p>

<p>Are you joking, or serious?</p>
<p>About researching in library stacks and other public and private collections&hellip;I&rsquo;m allergic to book dust&hellip;plus this isn&rsquo;t that kind of scholarly book. It&rsquo;s merely my own brilliant observations, intended to get Tribal bellydancers all inspired and creative. So maybe rethink my vintage images.</p>
<p>What about when someone makes a dingbat font with approximations of famous faces and images in high contrast? Like, I don&rsquo;t know, Andy Warhol&rsquo;s Marilyn Monroe?  Is that a copyight violation? At what point is it no longer copying?</p>

<p>That is not the way lawyers think. If you break the law, it makes no difference whether the actress is well-known or not, or if the images are &ldquo;only&rdquo; 2 inches high! You&rsquo;ve still broken the law!</p>

<p>Could you go to press on the initial date, but just not offer to sell the materials until after that date? Does publication = printing? I would think that if the materials are not made available to the public, then they are not actually published.</p>

<p>Is it hi-res enough that you can see if there are halftone dots? If so, the person who posted it probably scanned it out of a book. In that case, continue your online research in the hope of finding the publisher, and contact them, because if any copyright records exist, a publisher is the most likely to have them.</p>
<p><em>What about when someone makes a dingbat font with approximations of famous faces and images in high contrast?</em></p>
<p>For better or for worse, US copyright law doesn&rsquo;t protect fonts, but it does protect photographs.</p>
<p><em>if you say I actually have to consult a copyright lawyer (at considerable expense, I’m sure) I will leave those 3 images out.</em></p>
<p>A worst-case scenario is that you take a chance, publish the picture in the book, and it is seen by a someone who turns out to be a legitimate copyright holder, and he/she successfully sues to have all copies of your book recalled from bookstores at your expense and destroyed, along with all copies in your own inventory, preventing you from earning back any of the money you invested in printing and binding. Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a considerable expense.</p>
<p>The good news is, that&rsquo;s very unlikely to happen with such an old and obscure image. But my advice is, never gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everyone for all this advice.</p>
<p>I decided not to use the old photo. It was just an idea to illustrate my point on that page.</p>
<p>But for your viewing pleasure, here it is on Flickr: [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/truusbobjantoo/2221218291/sizes/o/]]
It has no halftone dots - it looks like a scan of an old postcard.</p>
<p>This person has literally thousands of such images posted and can&rsquo;t own the rights to all, although he&rsquo;s posted: &ldquo;All rights reserved.&rdquo; As I said, he never answered my query.</p>
<p>Wikipedia sees to use the guideline, any photo published in the U.S before 1923 is in the public domain. Outside the U.S, it seems to be less clear. Of course, if anyone objects, they can easily delete the image.</p>
<p>I did write to the Mucha museum.</p>
