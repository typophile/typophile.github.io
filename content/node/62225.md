body: "Hello\r\nI'm looking for a font like Century but a little more contemporary.
  I like the subtle slab serifs and the ball-terminals (I'm sure there's a correct
  term for this that I don't know, sorry). But ITC Century and Century Expanded both
  seem a little clunky and dated now (I hope I'm not offending anyone).\r\nI really
  like Font Bureau's Benton Modern, but I definitely can't afford upwards of $8,000
  for the family. Does anyone have suggestions of a more contemporary, \"fresher\"
  version of Century, that costs less than a new car?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n"

    Its a little more \"scotchy\" than the fonts you mention, but you might like it.
    Contact me directly and I can send you some samples.\r\n\r\nJames"
