  body: "Fiesta was made using an old face (wayyy predigital) called Old Vic No. 6
    - one of several treatments of the base Old Vic No. 2. I've never seen it digitally,
    so would be interested in the source and age of your image.\r\n\r\nFor some reason,
    Dan Solo, who usually stays true to the original, went skinnier and dropped some
    details when he digitized the base <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/old-vic/'
    target='_blank'>Old Vic</a>.\r\n\r\n"
