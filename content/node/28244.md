  a magazine cover and most of the fonts I've found don't have much design to them.
  I'll probably be designing something custom but some inspiration would help. Share
  your favorites, please."

    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sanvito/\">Sanvito's</a> best.
    One that I don't have, but like, is <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html\">Trinit\xE9's</a>."

  body: Kris if you're looking for inspiration you'll find many equilateral (Maltese)
    crosses that are beautiful but not so many plus signs; it's a matter of function.
    Draw your own; it'll be quicker and you'll get what you want.
