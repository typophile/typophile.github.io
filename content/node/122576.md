body: "Hello all\r\n\r\nI am trying to design a classic looking book using initials
  for each chapter. Problem is that the chapters are facsimiles of old articles and
  cannot be changed. Some articles start with a number as the first character and
  some even start with quotation marks. All the good looking initial fonts I have
  seen so far do not include numbers or special characters, only upper case letters
  A-Z. Any ideas on how to design the page to work around this? Any good fonts to
  use as initials with a centaur font main text?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nGeir Rosset\r\nOslo\r\nNorway"

    fonts have usually all necessary glyphs inside. So: Don\u2019t use freefonts.
    \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t know which style you want to have with your initials, but <a
    href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?35V1\">Centaurea Outline</a> could give
    a nice pairing with Centaur.  "

  body: "You might want to post an example of the font you're using, and as Renko
    suggested you might switch to a different font.\r\n\r\nIf the initial font you're
    using doesn't have numbers, a workaround might be to spell out the words \u2014
    \"Three\" instead of \"3\".  \r\n\r\nIn the case of a quotation mark starting
    the article, I'd probably use a regular quotation mark and then the next character
    would be large, as a large quote mark by itself would look weird. If your style
    is to make the initial caps flush left, do that and hang the small quote mark
    off to the left of the initial cap (probably raised above the baseline so it's
    near the top of the initial cap)."
