body: "I've been trying to track down a slightly bawdy typographical poem that I would
  guess dates to the mid-\u201960s. It uses the name of several typefaces, and the
  version I saw set the font name in the font in question (for which I will use caps):
  \r\n\r\n\"A SPARTAN BOOKMAN in his CLOISTER thought the ANCIENT world his oyster.....\"\r\n\r\nand
  finishes: \r\n\r\n\"He wants to be befriended by VENUS BOLD EXTENDED.\" \r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have this? I'd love to be able to share it with my students.\r\n\r\njd"

    have a copy of it. \r\n\r\nIf you do find it, please post it here in its entirety.
    We could use some bawdy, I think. Except those that are married, of course; their
    wives surely would never approve of a printer being involved in something unseemly."

  body: "I have found it, through Google Books: \r\n\r\nA Spartan Bookman in his Cloister\r\nThought
    the Antique world his oyster\r\nTimes Roman were his great delight.\r\nItalian
    Old Style girls the height\r\nOf Radiant beauty. What a shame\r\nNo Wedding Text
    will he declaim.\r\nInstead he\u2019s Stymied in his Tower\r\nShadow like and
    wonder how or \r\nWhen he\u2019ll find a Lydian pal,\r\nA Cursive Legend of a
    gal.\r\nHe yearns to be befriended \r\nBy Venus Bold Extended\r\n\r\nThe various
    sources only display a few lines at a time, so the jpeg is collaged from screen
    grabs semi-competently in Photoshop. I have not found author info. I had some
    hope of resetting, but too many of the fonts have not been revived. The image
    is a bit blurry, but I'm guessing it was only set once. Everyone since first publication
    has only seen copies of copies. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BaudyTypePoemFlat_4425.jpg]"
