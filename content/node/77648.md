  body: I'm always a little puzzled by things like the video link I posted and a lot
    of stuff labeled typography online, especially those "typographic illustration

  body: "\xABI don't think that type should be expressive at all. I can write the
    word 'dog' with any typeface and it doesn't have to look like a dog. But there
    are people that [think that] when they write 'dog' it should bark\xBB. \r\n\u2014
    Massimo Vignelli\r\n\r\nThe difficult (but most exciting) thing is to believe
    in type expressiveness keeping always in mind Massimo's words."
