    typefaces are out there. It&#39;ll be an  <BR>incredible stroke of luck if it

  body: As far as I can tell it&#39;s not one of the almost 2,600 script/handwritten
    fonts I have collected in the Script Font ID Guide, and if you DO find out what
    it is, I would be interested to add it to the Guide. It&#39;s a rather oddly done
    script, that takes an unusual approach to allow connecting letters with steeply
    slanting terminal strokes, but it gives the words a kind of style, in a homely
    sort of way.
