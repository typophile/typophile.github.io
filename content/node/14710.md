  chapter. i find Caledonia so wonderful. i couldnt put it into words. but the book
  mentions the face was created based on the idea of improving or refurbishing [[Scotch
  Roman]].\r\n\r\ni was wondering if anyone had some good links or some good info
  on Scotch Roman...i'm thinking something more about it's history and how it came
  about. 'anatomy...' seems very brief when talking about Scotch Roman\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nwill"

    Press, a new, digital, version of <a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/20027.html\">Linotype
    Monticello</a> (n\xE9 Binny & Ronaldson's \"Pica Roman No. 1\"), which is yet

    Bell, ATF Ofxord, Linotype Monticello, and the whole [sub?]category of Scoth Romans
    (in his <em>Anatomy of a Typeface</em>) is probably the best there is..."

  body: "Yes, besides the recent digital Monticello specimen (which I also have, thanks
    to Andy Crewdson - I hope he resurfaces one day...), Lawson* refers to the #1,
    and Updike has a passing reference too (look under \"Oxford\"). So I stand corrected
    - my bad. There was a \"spike\" in my memory about the numbering of the B&R stuff,
    and I think it was due to two things: the #1 was the second font they made (or
    at least finished); the #2 is listed first in the 1812, while the #1 is listed
    second. And I think I remember reading some author wondering about the preculiar
    numbering of the B&R #1... but at this point I think I'll give my memory the short
    vacation it apparently needs.\r\n\r\n* Maxim's \"Wilson\" slip just now must be
    due to another Scotch designer, Alexander Wilson; and/or the really good Scotch
    design from The Foundry by that name.\r\n\r\n> I know.\r\n\r\nI knew you knew
    (once you replied).\r\nFeel free to save me the digging next time!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I know this discussion was in 2005 but you may still be interested in pursuing
    it. James Mosley wrote a piece called \"Scotch Roman: What it is and how it got
    its name\" in Ampersand, quarterly journal of the pacific center for book arts,
    vol 17, nos 3 & 4, 1986. i believe binny & ronaldson type was modeled after the
    Bell & Stephenson type (also by Austin but much earlier than the Scotch faces).
    Monticello & Oxford are based on that earlier style, rather than Scotch. I have
    a chapter on the relation between Austin and the two Scotch founders, Wilson of
    Glasgow and Miller of Edinburgh in my forthcoming book on Richard Austin. The
    first showing of the new Scotch type was in 1811 (Edinburgh) & 1812 (Glasgow).
    There was an 1809 specimen but it is now lost.\r\n(Alastair Johnston)"

      1812, a Fry broadside, 4 pp from the Wood & Sharwood specimen of 1838, a couple
      of broadsides, and a couple of surprise showings (previously unpublished --
      well, they are all previously unpublished, I mean previously unknown) of the
      Bell types, artwork for the Porson greek, a page of Porson and a page showing
      the Sarcophagus Greek, which I am attributing to Austin.

    which note that Edward Daniel Clarke was involved in creating the typeface for
    Cambridge, and it has the historical distinction of being a sans-serif typeface
    which pre-dated the famous "Two-Line English Egyptian" by Caslon!

    Sarcophagus Greek in all its glory. It is indeed a sans serif and undoubtedly
    influenced John Flaxman who illustrated <i>Greek Marbles</i> of Edw Clarke, where
    it was first used. Full story to come, including why it is almost certainly by
    Richard Austin, in my forthcoming monograph."
