  body: That appears to be Artcraft. I&#39;m aware of a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/artcraft/urw-t-regular/testdrive.html?s=CEGKMQRSTacfgkry&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> URW version</a> and a  <a href="http://www.exuberance.com/type/artcraft.html"
    target="_blank"> shareware version</a>. Neither is a perfect match for your sample,
    but the shareware version seems to be closer.
