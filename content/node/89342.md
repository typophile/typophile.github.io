body: "Hi there. This is my first post on Typophile so please excuse me if this topic
  has been answered elsewhere or if I'm in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nMy question is
  about managing kerning across interpolated fonts in FontLab. I have no experience
  in this area and I am just trying to understand how it is handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>An
  example:</strong>\r\n<blockquote>Say I have a light and a bold. I have kerned both.
  I then interpolate (using Blend Fonts?) a regular in-between. The regular would
  have kern values averaging the light and bold.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Where
  I'm having trouble:</strong>\r\n<blockquote>If I were to throw out the light weight's
  values and re-kern it from scratch there would dozens of pairs rewritten. I want
  those changes to factor into the regular's kern values, but those, once interpolated,
  seem to be static.\r\n\r\nI've also fixed some broken glyphs in the regular weight
  and I don't want that work to be overwritten.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nWould I interpolate
  kern pairs without interpolating my glyphs? What method do you recommend? Am I asking
  the right question?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    existing regular kerns with the new ones that you just interpolated. Unfortunately
    FontLab has problems with importing kerning, so it may be better and easier to
    split your final production fonts into individual files that import their kerning
    tables from OpenType feature files during compilation. That\u2019s how I keep
    this stuff straight, but I\u2019m also jumping between three other programs to
    do this stuff. \r\n\r\nRead this thread for more on the subject: http://typophile.com/node/71250"

  body: "If you do everything in multiple master space in the first place, instead
    of using the blend function, you can keep everything in sync with no additional
    effort.\r\n\r\nOf course, working in MMs has its own complications, but it also
    has a lot of advantages. This is one of them."

  body: "<cite>I then interpolate (using Blend Fonts?) a regular in-between.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    you have two single fonts and want to interpolate them, I\u2019d recommend to
    define an MM axis in one of them and then use the Assign Master command to get
    the other one in. Then use Generate Instance. Assign Master is more reliable than
    Blend Fonts or Mask to Master.\r\n\r\n<cite>Would I interpolate kern pairs without
    interpolating my glyphs?</cite>\r\n\r\nI would interpolate the whole font, then
    export the kerning as pfa file and re-import it into your final Regular. This
    method works quite realiably for me.\r\n"

  body: "@Thomas, I've tried blending with \"Build the Multiple Master font\" selected
    and the created font seems to inherit only from one parent. I've also tried \"Generate
    Instance\" with the same results. Both my weight and width axes are defined in
    both fonts. I must be missing a step. I'll continue to explore this direction.\r\n\r\n@Tim,
    I haven't tried the \"Assign Master\" command. I'll give this a shot. I'll also
    try your .pfa method. Is this comparable to the .fea method that Adam Twardoch
    describes in the thread James linked to? (http://typophile.com/node/71250)\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, James, Thomas, and Tim."

  body: I think you need exactly the same kerning pairs in all masters for the blending
    to work. All kerns that exist in other masters must be set to 0 explicitly before
    blending.

  body: "Tim (or anybody else): when you bring one font into MM using Assign Master,
    it gets the kerning of the \"first\" MM font right? At least that's what happened
    to me recently when I brought two separate fonts together into MM. I realized
    that once I generated an interpolated instance, and the kerning was not interpolated.\r\n\r\nI
    had to export the metrics data of my second font and reimport it in the MM font.\r\n\r\nAny
    way to avoid that, or was it a mistake from my part?"

  body: I was not aware that FL omits the kerning when using Assign Master. You need
    to use .pfa to get it in into the MM font, it seems.

  body: I use Mask-to-Master to create the MM data, then I import the afm data for
    each instance from the original and go from there. It has worked fine all of these
    years. Never had a problem.
