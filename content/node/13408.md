body: i noticed that [[Mark Simonson]] has a link to cafe press <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/marksimonson">on
  his webiste</a> to order T-shirts. I was intrigued, so i did a bit of digging and
  found http://www.printmojo.com. Is anyone familiar with any similar services that
  offer a kind of screen on demand type thing? I'd be interested in finding out more...
