  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Williams Caslon Text has been used by Boston Magazine for nearly a year for their text face. Soon the retail version will be out from Font Bureau, with a lot of additional kerning and some more Open Type goodness, such as a short descender option, swashes, and Central European characters.</p>
<p>My overriding goal in this revival of Caslon was to capture the legendary reading comfort of the metal Caslons at text sizes. I can&rsquo;t fully capture the look of the design on screen, because what looks slim at size in print looks chunky when blown up on the screen. I also wanted to capture the aesthetic of Caslon: warm, inviting, and authoritative at the same time. In particular the original metal Pica 2 of Caslon, and the best revivals, has a distinctive &lsquo;dark but open&rsquo; look.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from the magazine. First, an intro spread for an article about college graduates coming out of college with no jobs, called Generation WTF:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/WC_Bos_GenWTF_3851.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>They used my italic bigger than intended size, but because of the color and reverse, I was delighted with what they did.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/WC_Bos_Generation_WTF_text_5138.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a typical narrow column, with Williams Caslon Text just doing its thing quietly. I was surprised how it works so small, 9.5/11 points. It&rsquo;s designed to work with relatively leading. Note the bold small caps as a section heading:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/WC_Boos_narrowcolumn_6044.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a wide column, 10/11 points with Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Big Caslon at the top and Hoefler&rsquo;s Knockout&ndash;good company!</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/WC_Bos_wide_5942.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a clever use of the regular small caps and bold italic, with color in the masthead. This is really tiny in real life:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Tiffany. Yes, it has been a thrill to see it used by really sensitive and creative designers.</p>
<p>The main thing for me was seeing that the color was right on the page of a magazine, which I was really anxious about it. That was a relief.</p>
<p>Then they did things that surprised me, like using it so small in very short columns, which turned out to be quite readable. And occasionally using the italic large, in color, which also worked.</p>
<p>Also it was nice to see that all those additional characters are useful. For example in doing the first line in small caps they could set &ldquo;Boston&rdquo;, the name of the magazine, in small cap italics&ndash;and if need be in bold small cap italics, which their design pattern would call for in other circumstances. Also the small cap question mark they used after &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; And in the new version there are small cap figures, so &ldquo;Sept. 11&rdquo; could be set with a barbed &ldquo;1&rdquo; that fits the small cap height.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks to your and others' urging on Typophile, in the final version I made the stressed &ldquo;0&rdquo; and barbed &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the old style numbers default, and put the traditional circular 0 and &ldquo;small cap I&rdquo; looking &ldquo;1&rdquo; in a stylistic alternative set, which you can choose if you want.</p>
<p>At any rate, I can see that the months of work expanding the character set and kerning will actually be useful to good designers.</p>
<p>They also sometimes use this text size quite large, negatively leaded, in a kind of decorative text block. That has kind of made me cringe, because I know that the incomplete version of the Great Primer size (18 point) in my computer will look much better when it&rsquo;s complete. One day&hellip;</p>

<p>I rather like the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; kerning in the First Things First sample.</p>
<p>Bill, why would you seek authenticity in letter form, and then add the anachronism of 21st century kerning?
Isn&rsquo;t it feasible that the legendary reading comfort of metal Caslon is an effect of the totality of the design, the letter shapes being optimized for available fit, and that expanded kerning and a narrow space character will lessen the comfort zone?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, I wasn&rsquo;t really seeking authenticity in letter form. What I was seeking was to get the overall dark-but-open look and the reading comfort. When I didn&rsquo;t like something, I just changed it. For example, the a and g aren&rsquo;t W.C. but W.B. :)</p>
<p>Very often when I tried to do Caslon better, I was humiliated because his proportions worked better. And so I often went back to Caslon in the regular roman. But some of Caslon&rsquo;s stuff is just screwy, like wildly different weights of caps. And he has some howlers, like the lower case italic s in some sizes. My theory is that he had an excellent eye, but just needed to get it out the door, so he just said, screw it, I&rsquo;ll get it better next time.</p>
<p>And speaking of the italic, mine is far from authentic, but nobody&rsquo;s revival is authentic, partly because the original isn&rsquo;t very good. The 19th century revivals are &ldquo;improvements&rdquo;, and so even Founders Caslon, which is based on them, isn&rsquo;t authentic. But then, I don&rsquo;t really believe that trying to be authentic is worth the candle.</p>
<p>Mine takes the original italic and redraws it both wider, which Carole Twombly also did in Adobe Caslon, and more upright, unlike what she did. I did keep the varied slants of Caslon&rsquo;s original, and not the revivals. I think that there is an inner logic in the variations that give a liveliness absent from other more regularized italics. But with the adjustments is more readable than Adobe Caslon&rsquo;s italic. So I&rsquo;m pleased with the way it came out. The display sizes will be prettier, because of more contrast, when I get around to finishing them.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about whether more kerning will detract from the look. I think not, but I&rsquo;ll only really know when I see it printed, in mass. The word space is not tight&ndash;it is 250 em units in the regular (x height 393). Also the letter spacing is slightly looser than Adobe Caslon, and the characters a bit narrower. Both of these are authentic to Caslon&rsquo;s Pica 2, and I think do contribute to the look and comfort that got Caslon its reputation. The overall effect is that it sets about the same as Adobe Caslon, but I think looks darker and more open because of various tricks I did&ndash;mainly following Caslon, but I&rsquo;d like to think creatively rather than slavishly.</p>
<p>The lack of kerning in &ldquo;Yet&rdquo;, above, to me is a bit glaring, and I think the proper kerning that is in the final will be a help without messing things up. I tried not to over kern&ndash;a number of times I did and tested and then pulled back&ndash;but I guess I&rsquo;ll only really know for sure when the final version is used.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William,</p>
<p>Congrats on your great work. It seems that Caslon might have a new &ldquo;era of glory&rdquo;? I&rsquo;ve been working on my own interpretation for about a year now. The basic ideas have been with me for much longer though, but Veer have made me fulfill the task. At a glance it seems to be enough differences between our versions so I&rsquo;m sure there will be a market for both of them. My version will be released early next year. Anyway good luck with your release. I look forward to see more of it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had missed looking at this thread originally. I think this typeface fills a serious gap, an authentic, yet not over-authentic, revival of Caslon that works well as a type for ordinary body copy.</p>
<p>I do see <em>one</em> problem, although that problem is not a criticism of the typeface itself. The decision to give Caslon a heavier weight is one that I endorse as something that was needed. In this face, though, that was done with perhaps a tad too much restraint and caution. As a result, and given that, generally speaking, magazines deal with a typographically-unsophisticated public, I fear that some potential sales of this font will be lost because potential purchasers may decide they can get much the same overall visual effect with, say, Baskerville.</p>
<p>Which marks the first time Caslon and Baskerville could be confused since the days of Ben Franklin.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the appreciative words! It means a lot from my fellow typophilers.</p>
<p>Stefan, as you know from working on Caslon, because of the big difference of different sizes and the rough printing of the original, &ldquo;Caslon&rdquo; is a bit of a typographic &ldquo;Rorschach test&rdquo;, and different people see different things in it. Many revivals are very good, and very different one from the other&ndash;including Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Big Caslon, above.</p>
<p>John (quadribloc), I don&rsquo;t think there is any danger of this getting mixed up with Baskerville. Actually, Abobe Caslon, being wider and because of the way it handles contrast is a bit of a &ldquo;Caskerville&rdquo;. But in this the narrower characters (from Caslon&rsquo;s Pica 2 size) and lower contrast I think gives it quite a different look. Of course this is most obvious side by side.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the notions that guided me is that a really strong typeface design, such as Times New Roman or Baskerville is recognizable just from its texture on the page. Such a distinctive look was my goal here.</p>

<p>Yes I&rsquo;m aware of all the differences regarding point sizes. I have among other Caslon specimens a copy of the facsimile printed in the twenties (i think 1924). The book has many great reproductions of the original cut printed in various situations. This book have become the foundation from which my design have developed. I have then made certain choices, changes and additions from the original. Ligatures, SC, full CE and ornaments are things that have been added. Also a headline cut for the regular will also be featured. Hopefully reviews and notes of both our version will create a minor revival for the beautiful typeface that Caslon is.</p>

<p>John (quadribloc), I don’t think there is any danger of 
this getting mixed up with Baskerville. Actually, Abobe
Caslon, being wider and because of the way it handles
contrast is a bit of a “Caskerville”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree; as noted, I wasn&rsquo;t criticizing the typeface itself, which indeed is clearly a Caslon and not a Baskerville.</p>
<p>Rather, what I was trying to say was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mass-market publications generally cater to a fairly undiscriminating audience in typographic terms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Caslon is Oldstyle and Baskerville is Transitional, unlike Times Roman, Baskerville still has some definite Oldstyle mannerisms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baskerville is also a good typeface;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The weight you had chosen for your font, being only slightly heavier than that typical of Caslon revivals, causes text in Williams Caslon to match text in Baskerville in darkness;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thus, my concern is basically that your typeface will not have as big a niche available for itself as it might otherwise have had&hellip; because it is more exposed to competition from Baskerville.</p>

Of course, at the present time, when it becomes available, Williams Caslon will be specified by people who know and care about fine typography - and, as I&rsquo;ve admitted from the beginning, it doesn&rsquo;t really look like Baskerville.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m thinking is that it will be successful enough there that there will be a &ldquo;down the road&rdquo; for the face. Where it becomes a reasonably well-known choice for typography. That&rsquo;s when I thought it might reach the notice of people less committed to choosing the best possible face, or a unique and different face, who might, if there was a question of expense or convenience, just opt for Baskerville instead&hellip; as they might opt for Garamond instead of Adobe Caslon, although Adobe Caslon, like Willams Caslon, looks much more like other Caslons than like a different face, whether Garamond or Baskerville.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t understand the industry well enough to comment further on the market. My goal was just to get the best text face I could. I don&rsquo;t have a business head, but hopefully the good folks at Font Bureau do.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jos!</p>
<p>Nick, it is the same, but from a screen capture, large. The others are scanned from the printed page, which are small point sizes. Everything makes a difference, which always amazes me.</p>
<p>Hrant, thanks. On the g, as I mentioned above I don&rsquo;t like Caslon&rsquo;s g&rsquo;s, so I just made my own. In some cases, when I decided to depart from Caslon, I repented and returned to his forms, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Kevin, there is a long answer to your question, which would be an essay on the history of Caslon and its revivals. And a short answer.</p>
<p>The short answer: I think of basic three kinds of Caslon: based on text size, based on display size, and only roughly inspired by Caslon. ATF&rsquo;s Caslon 540 and its revivals are based on the display sizes, with more heavily bracketed, pointed serifs, and wider characters with higher contrast. The ones based on the text sizes include Monotype Caslon and Merganthaler Linotype Caslon and Adobe Caslon. These are narrower and more slabby, but Adobe has a bit more influence from larger sizes. Big Caslon is based on display sizes, the largest ones. There are a number of Caslons that are only loosely inspired by the original, like Ed Benguiat&rsquo;s Caslon 224, which is more Benguiat than Caslon&ndash;not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>The thing I spent the most time on studying and trying to capture was the magic of Caslon&rsquo;s reading comfort. This has to do with a lot of subtle things put together: the weight and width of the characters, the spacing, the modulation of both straight and curved strokes, handling of the serifs.</p>

<p>You mention it&rsquo;s legendary readability. Do you base this comment on how it was received or comments made by contemporaries and historians? How were these judgments made or substantiated? Were intrinsic and distinctive characteristics of the types singled out when these judgments were made? Who / what historical circumstances / which characteristics mediated it&rsquo;s reputation. Was part of it it&rsquo;s use in certain types of publications?</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant has his &lsquo;critique of judgment&rsquo; but judgments of readability aren&rsquo;t covered there. Or are they? We need a new critque.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How were these judgments made or substantiated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caslon had a mystique and caché from the late 19th to mid-20 Century. Theodore Low De Vinne, revered as the greatest printer of the 19th century in the US, praised Caslon to the skies, which probably helped promote the mystique. George Bernard Shaw insisted that all his works were printed in Caslon. And every major foundry had several versions of Caslon in the early 20th century. Printers said, &ldquo;When in doubt use Caslon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of this mystique had to to with readability, but I think a lot of it did. Writing in 1967 Ben Lieberman in Types of Typefaces wrote specifically about its readability, noting that the individual characters weren&rsquo;t so great, but the result in mass is very effective.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that part of the mystique came from the fact that it was the first old style to be revived. I do think that the high contrast types of the early nineteenth century were less readable, and that as a result Caslon seemed somewhat of a miracle when it re-appeared. When Monotype started reviving other old styles, I think it took some of the edge away from Caslon. But there was still something distinctive in Caslon that a lot of publishers and readers liked. I think it was reading comfort, but I can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>Caslon didn&rsquo;t make as successful a transition to photo type and digital type, as it had from foundry type to hot metal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did that occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years of work. I just kept trying out different things until it worked to my eyes as a text face. Of course I have a definite idea about what combination of things was needed, but maybe it&rsquo;s better just to let the design speak for itself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my opinion, there are some specific factors about Caslon that explain why it was more popular than Baskerville, or either a Jenson roman or an Aldine roman. Not better, just more popular.</p>
<p>Caslon and Times Roman don&rsquo;t seem very similar on the surface - and they are very different in proportions and x-height. But they both have sharp serifs and slanted stress.</p>
<p>I think that Bell, Oxford, Baskerville, Bembo, Poliphilus, and even a modern roman that isn&rsquo;t condensed could all provide plenty of reading comfort - but Times and Caslon, without compromising reading comfort, also have features that make them seem more brilliant - and that is the combination that worked for them both.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t find a big difference with the breaks; actually it took time to get back into it. I did find that in the morning, when I looked at it anew, I often saw new things. Also as I started from zero, there was a gradual learning curve. I do remember the day, after some years, when I suddenly felt &ldquo;hey, I know how to do this&rdquo;. I started not just to sense when something was wrong, but to see what it was.</p>
<p>John (quadribloc), I think I understand your point, but I do think that the differences do affect reading comfort, though I acknowledge that it is a small affect, and that other classic faces are also very readable. I think your comparison of Caslon &amp; Times isn&rsquo;t on target. The pointed serifs, similar to Times New Roman, are in the Caslons influenced by Caslon&rsquo;s larges sizes, reflected in Caslon 540 and Big Caslon. The Caslons intended for text, the originals as well as Adobe Caslon and mine, have longer, less bracketed serifs.</p>

<p>Bill, if what you think is capable of influencing perceptions 150 years ago, that would indeed be a miracle!
Caslon&rsquo;s re-appearance was a novelty, given far more importance than it merited by historians such as Updike and Reed, who used it as a hammer with which to bash the popular modern style that was too trade for their taste. Its significance was probably more in motivating the Miller &amp; Richard &ldquo;old style&rdquo;, which was a variant of the modern style.</p>
<p><em>Caslon didn’t make as successful a transition to photo type&hellip;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not supported by its appearance in many major campaigns of the photo-type era, eg:

<p>To a man, the type historians were.

<p><em>Equating the two</em></p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s equating?
I&rsquo;m merely trying to establish some objectivity here.
You and Bill have opinions of what is important or successful, to which you are entitled, but when they fly in the face of general consensus, just who is being self-important?
You will find copious variants of Caslon phototype in specimen books of the era, in advertising campaigns, and in awards annuals. 
Surely this indicates a mighty success in porting the face to new media?&ndash; and across a larger jump than from foundry type to hot metal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, I was talking about text type, not display. That example you have is Caslon 540, I think, which was and is excellent in all media, but it&rsquo;s a display type. In general the problems in transition to digital I believe were in text types, and display did much better.</p>
<p>My memory is not seeing so much Caslon in the photo era&ndash;70s and 80s&ndash;and of course being an old guy I lived and read before during and after photo type. But I wasn&rsquo;t in the graphics business as you were, so I may be wrong. (I&rsquo;m not talking about Ed Benguiat&rsquo;s Caslon 224, which is an attractive display type but not really Caslon.)</p>
<p>My memory of the way the New Yorker looked then was that its Caslon was very anemic looking, but I may be confusing it with pre-photo type. The digital New Yorker Caslon, digitized based on the photo version by Bruno Maag, and worked on later by James Montalbono is pretty good.</p>
<p>I think Adobe Caslon, the best text Caslon generally available till now, falls short of what Caslon was in metal as a text type, and I suspect it&rsquo;s been used more in display, though it was intended for text.</p>
<p>Above I think I mixed up De Vinne and Updike. It was Updike who said that the revival of Caslon in &lsquo;Lady Willoughby&rsquo;s Diary&rsquo; was &ldquo;the chief typographic event of the mid-19th century.&rdquo; This was in the 20s, perhaps the height of Caslon&rsquo;s second wave of popularity.</p>
<p>The Miller &amp; Richard Old Style is not a &lsquo;modern&rsquo; face as Bodoni is. It is obviously influenced by Caslon, and its c and e have a backslanted stress. But most notable the contrast is much less than &lsquo;modern&rsquo; types. It was evidently intended to capture the qualities of Caslon for those used to reading &lsquo;modern&rsquo; style, and is called &lsquo;Old Style&rsquo; for that very reason. &ndash;Revivals of Caslon were also at first called &lsquo;Old Style&rsquo; as well. Your view that it is simply a variant of modern I don&rsquo;t think will wash, as it clearly adopts and adapts aspects of Caslon&rsquo;s look.</p>
<p>Also I believe that once the high contrast look was supplanted toward the end of the 19th Century, lower contrast types remained dominant for text ever since, at least in English speaking countries.</p>
<p>Why lower contrast won out we can disagree about, but the general view today is that text type needs lower contrast for good readability. So in hypothesizing that readability was an important factor, I don&rsquo;t think I am out of line.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure Nick doesn&rsquo;t support that distinction. Even though the effect of scale on a design is clearly fundamental; a font that looks like a Caslon at 11 point simply cannot look like a Caslon at 72.</p>

In fact, there is no unified design at different sizes&ndash;no single typeface design called &lsquo;Caslon&rsquo;. If you look at the serifs on Caslon 540, in Nick&rsquo;s design, above, and the samples of Williams Caslon and Adobe Caslon, above, you will see that they are quite different, and that is just the beginning. 540 is based on the original large sizes.

<p>In as much as a digital single-master font looks sharp and can be nicely kerned and tracked for a display setting, yes, but it nonetheless took a while for optically-scaled digital display fonts to emerge in print, and they haven&rsquo;t yet done so on the web!</p>
<p>@Bill:<em> I was talking about text type, not display.</em>
@Hrant: <em>I’m pretty sure Nick doesn’t support that distinction. </em></p>
<p>Right, I was objecting to a generalization which ignored display typography in marketing work. This is the same old saw &ldquo;nothing but book faces counts as real type&rdquo; beloved of Updike et al.</p>
<p><em>Your view that it is simply a variant of modern I don’t think will wash, as it clearly adopts and adapts aspects of Caslon’s look.</em></p>
<p>It is modern in its high contrast, vertical stress, fine finish and regularity, while adopting the bracketed, angled serifs (especially in the capitals) of the old style. <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3FZ4eFeWNk/SWDc5f8M-jI/AAAAAAAAAc0/YeKHPjaG4wo/s400/3+M&R+OS+1860+-+800.jpg">This</a> from James Mosley&rsquo;s site:</p>
<p>Compare this with the old style as conceived of by Morris and the neo-incunabulists at the end of the 19th century, and those faces produced in the subsequent wave of historicism that were far more authentic revivals and reproductions &ndash; and the M&amp;R old style comes across as a modern Victorian face archly tipping its hat to the quaintness of antiquity, nothing more.</p>

<p>Nick that&rsquo;s not true. Compare here Bitstream&rsquo;s versions of Bruce Old Style and Bodoni. The ratio of thick to thin in Old Style is much less than in Bodoni. Note also the narrower proportions. Both of these are characteristic of old style.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Oldstyle_vs_Bodoni_6404.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>While Mosley is of course right that later revivals were much more authentic, I really think this is way more than a tip of the hat to old style. The proportions and contrast are key features, and radically change the color of the text in mass, making it strikingly more old style than Bodoni. The Scotches are somewhere in between the two. The contrast, proportions and related spacing are also very important for readability in text type, in my opinion, and I&rsquo;m sure in many other people&rsquo;s as well, including the first William Caslon.</p>
<p>I neglected to make clear above that I was only talking about revivals of the text sizes, but I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean to say that display type is unimportant. I don&rsquo;t believe that for a moment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, I don&rsquo;t hold Bitstream&rsquo;s revivals out as accurate, but they are close enough, because the differences between the two types are in fact radical. The original sample of M &amp; R Old Style from James Mosley is rather similar to Bruce Old Style as far as contrast and proportions, and it is very different from Bodoni. In the sample above from Myfonts, the differences would be more obvious if equalized for x-heights, instead of width. The &lsquo;old style&rsquo; has much less contrast, and is much narrower, having in fact &lsquo;humanist&rsquo; proportions in the x-height area, with the oval o, whereas Bodoni is wider, with a circular o.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time now to chase down originals.</p>

<p>Bodoni is often held out as the typical modern/didone face, but it was more obsolete than Caslon during latter half of the 19th century. For this discussion to be meaningful, one should compare Victorian era moderns and old styles.</p>
<p>By then, the modern text face had evolved to be narrower, lighter, and have less contrast than at the beginning of the century.
This is demonstrated in my facsimile revival Scotch Modern, based on a 12 pt. American face of similar vintage to the Miller and Richard old style. <img src="/images/old-images/more_3624.jpg" alt="">
The desire to make a smart, clean, high-tech impression was, at the time, more important than ramping up style. A similar aesthetic is at work today in the technology-driven ClearType faces, which have a narrow range of proportion and contrast.</p>

<p>For this discussion to be meaningful</p>

<p>No, that would be to make the debate go more your way, which is wrong :)</p>
<p>My basic point is that Old Style handling of contrast and proportion is more readable, and that&rsquo;s why first the &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; of M&amp;R was successful, and then the later revivals of Caslon and old faces.</p>
<p>Scotchs were more favored in Britain I believe because they are more readable than the Moderns, but also the old styles are better than the Scotch, though the gap is less.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; faces are also called &lsquo;Didone&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s what I was talking about. As I said, the Scotch are in between the Modern and Old style.</p>
<p>Even the Scotch have noticeably different contrast and probably proportions, though I haven&rsquo;t checked on the proportions. With the Scotch a prominent difference from the old style is how lean the arches still are, compared to old style, where the weight of the verticals is carries much further toward the stems, and top and bottom of the O. IMHO this reduces readability of the Scotch in text.</p>
<p>Some of the more recent Scotch-influenced designs, like Caledonia, in my opinion correct the readability problems of the 19th century scotches for text.</p>
<p>On readability, I realize of course that all of this is debatable. My point in this thread was not so much to make a case about readability, but just to report what ideas, right or wrong, drove my thinking in creating this font.</p>

<p>Thus, the real impact on reading comfort came from rising living standards relative to the cost of paper.

<p>I would add that the modern face was also widely used for editorial text in magazines and newspapers of the historicist era (1890-1930), even when advertisements were set in all kinds of ancient revivals and Goudy fonts. Linotype&rsquo;s Legibility Series types of the 1930s were all moderns.</p>
<p>From its reappearance in the mid 19th century, the old style was therefore a &ldquo;display&rdquo; face, used when a patina of class was required to be demonstrated by text matter, beyond the basic readability of the modern style.</p>
<p>Bill, what do you make of the fact that during the boom years of newspaper publishing, from the 1890s until the 1950s, old style faces were <strong>never</strong> used for body text? The most-read medium of all time (in terms of hours spent by the general population) had no time for the old style. When the chips were down, when people were jostling with the early edition on a bumpy, crowded bus or train, when readability was at a premium, old style couldn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks James!</p>
<p>By the way in answer to Peter, above, on how I managed to make a Calson that a city magazine would find suitable, I thought of some further things. First, a basic goal for me was to make it look classic, rather than antique. Any antique look I think would disqualify a font for text use in a popular magazine. Second, I like to think it is a bit more warm and affable than Adobe Caslon, and I think that helps, if others see it that way also.</p>
<p>Nick, the main issue for me on readability is not vertical or backward stress, because both can be highly readable, as Caledonia and its successors show. The issues are rather contrast, and also proportions and spacing. My objections to Bodoni for text is not an issue of stress, but of mainly of contrast and and secondarily of proportion.</p>
<p>As to newspaper type, I believe that all of the Legibility series have low contrast, as opposed to Bodoni or Scotchs. Also, newspaper printing conditions with metal type tended to thicken thins, reducing contrast.</p>
<p>Also there are special conditions in Newspapers, which you could tell me more about, of narrow columns of small sized type which they want to pack in with little leading. These conditions I think favor larger x-heights and wider type, to keep it readable at as small a size as possible. But these conditions are not ideal for readability, and where the price of paper is not so much of an issue, narrower proportions and longer extenders have tended to win out.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So the Times of London never existed, or Times New Roman is a Scotch typeface?</p>
<p>ps If Kent sees this, I&rsquo;d be interested in what he thinks Dwiggins did in Caledonia to change and improve it for text, compared to the 19th century Scotchs.</p>

<p>Not so much the latter, because the columns are so narrow. And remember, you can make up for apparent size being reduced due to narrowness by simply using a larger point size; sure you use up more vertical space, but hyphenation gets controlled much better. Times worked well for newspapers because it had a large x-height but a <em>narrow</em> set.</p>

<p><em>Nick, the main issue for me on readability is not vertical or backward stress, </em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I differ in criteria. You are considering formal characteristics of a typefaces as indicative of their readability, and applying these to historical circumstances. But this is entirely subjective and aesthetic. There are no studies that compare the readability of the class of modern/didone faces with the class of old style faces. Not today, certainly not in the 19th century. So how can you say that old styles became successful because of their better readability? Why would a style that was not eminently readable be used as the default for an age in which mass literacy emerged? The &ldquo;in spite of&rdquo; argument seems perverse, no Occam there.</p>
<p>I would suggest at least two other reasons, which are historically contingent. Firstly, it was during the 19th century that the diversity of typefaces proliferated astronomically, so the idea that founders could offer an alternate style of basic text type followed on from this, hence the modernized old-style of M&amp;R.</p>
<p>Secondly, the old style of type was ideologically motivated, a protest against industrial culture. 
The role of the socialist reformer and medievalist William Morris was central in fostering the historicist movement in typography.</p>
<p><em>So the Times of London never existed, or Times New Roman is a Scotch typeface?</em></p>
<p>I stand corrected. Times is something of a hybrid old-style, however, with its high contrast and modern caps.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how Beatrice Warde told it in 1935:</p>
<p><em>But midway in the nineteenth century it became necessary to stock for bookwork two different kinds of type face; one had been revived as an antiquarian curiosity, not as a new general fashion invented by a contemporary punch-cutter. Hence it was from the first an alternative to the still prevailing style, which could still be called ‘Modern’. But as time went on, and more and more publishers welcomed the earlier and less brilliant cut of type in ordinary books, the antiquarian connotation of the phrase ‘Old Face’ disappeared. It became evident that every future publisher would be able to make a choice between two equally fashionable faces by the same printer.</em></p>
<p>I hear her saying that the second half of the 19c saw a shift from the old-style as a &ldquo;display&rdquo; alternative (as you describe) to its acceptance as a useful and more neutral face. Whether one might want to read &ldquo;less brilliant&rdquo; as &ldquo;more readable&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll leave for others to take up.</p>

<p>So how can you say that old styles became successful because of their better readability?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can say it because I think it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve said I can&rsquo;t prove it, but I conjecture it because of what my eyes tell me, and the history of the shift. My whole life, and I&rsquo;ve been reading for 60 years, I&rsquo;ve rarely seen extended text that is &lsquo;Modern&rsquo;, and not so much outside math and physics texts that is 19th century style Scotch. But I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of &lsquo;Modern&rsquo;, with full contrast, in display usage.</p>
<p>Also from Caslon to Benton to Slimbach, lower contrast has been seen as suitable for smaller text. So if you deny that, as you seem to, you are going against the weight of typographic tradition, both before and after the &lsquo;Modern&rsquo; phase.</p>
<p>I am also influenced by the fact that others, like Updike and Lieberman seem to agree with me about the readability of Caslon&ndash;and it seems very many printers in the last century. The mystique didn&rsquo;t come from nothing. And Lieberman was a journalist talking to a lot of type people in the 60&rsquo;s, including Beatrice Warde, Paul Standard, and Hermann Zapf so I&rsquo;m pretty sure his views reflect those of others he talked with. That doesn&rsquo;t make them right, but it reassures me that I maybe am not crazy in seeing what I see.</p>
<p>No tests will ever come if you don&rsquo;t first have the hypothesis. Gauss, I believe it was, said that the theorem is more important than the proof, because more innovative. I&rsquo;m taking my hypotheses and running with them by showing what they can do in print.</p>
<p>Also I do make sure to judge by my eyes, and not by my theories. I try everything, and see what seems to work. The theories have been inspiration, not constraint.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> &gt; ps If Kent sees this, I’d be interested in what he thinks Dwiggins did in Caledonia to change and improve it for text, compared to the 19th century Scotchs.</cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let Dwiggins speak for himself about his intentions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effort that matured into Caledonia started with a strong liking for the Scotch Modern face. That sound, workable type has served the printing craft for a hundred years. But there are a few features about it that are not quite happy. How far could one go towards modifying those features without spoiling the vigor of the face? That was the start. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why modify Scotch? Isn’t it good enough as it stands? Well, there was a kind of wooden heaviness about the modeling of some of the original Wilson letters that didn’t seem to need to be there. And when you got down to our own day, and the design had suffered the changes of many recuttings, the woodenness had become clumsier still by reason of the 19th century designer’s obligation to strike all his curves with a compass and to get everything hard and symmetrical and shipshape from a mechanical draftsman’s point of view. Why couldn’t you go back to the feeling about printing types that inspired the Wilson punch-cutter and then just liven up a few of his curves without changing the action and color of the face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[ . . . ]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face as it emerges is not at all like Bulmer’s Martin nor like Wilson’s Scotch, but it has touches of both of them in spots. Also it has something of that simple, hard-working, feet-on-the-ground quality that has kept Scotch Modern in service for so many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[from &ldquo;A Note on the Face by the Designer&rdquo; in the original Caledonia specimen (Mergenthaler Linotype Co., Brooklyn: 1939)]</p>
<p>But this thread should stay about Caslon (specifically Williams Caslon), not Caledonia.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems to me that this discussion is stunted by reference only to an Anglo-American typographic history. Does it really make sense to talk about such a history as in some way justifying or contradicting claims about &lsquo;readability&rsquo;, which is presumably a universal measure of text in any literate society &ndash; human physiology and psychology being largely consistent?</p>
<p>The French seem to have happily read huge amounts of high contrast Didot family types for a very long time. In Greece, high contrast types based on Paris and Leipzig models remain so common to this day that they are referred to simply as απλά, i.e. natural or normal.</p>
<p>I do think that there are readability issues with some Didone style types, especially in their revived, rationalised forms and as printed on modern presses and papers, but I don&rsquo;t think these issues are due to high stroke contrast per se. Rather, I think it is the arrangement of that contrast in many Latin letters that causes difficulties. Greek types in related styles seem much less problematic, because the arrangement of the contrast favours the horizontals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I agree with you about the distribution of contrast being important, and also the structure of latin type. But that doesn&rsquo;t gainsay the idea that there is a problem with Didot for extended text&ndash;which indeed you feel as well. And it may be that it is worse now, because in letter press printing, ink spread does make for a kind of natural optical scaling by adding a stroke around the outline of the letter.</p>
<p>About distribution, one need only look to Times New Roman, which is a rather high contrast type, but because of its aggressive back slant, the contrast doesn&rsquo;t produce the &lsquo;dazzle&rsquo; of Didot. In fact, thins that are vertical, horizontal, and diagonal have a different visual impact.</p>
<p>Latin type, with its dominant verticals, is always in danger of a &lsquo;picket fence&rsquo; kind of dazzle. I do think this has a root in the physiology of the eye, or at least in the way our brain processes visual data, grounded in both edge effects and figure/ground ambiguity, which we have discussed before here. And I do think that&rsquo;s a problem going on with Didot.</p>
<p>The quote from Beatrice Warde, above in Craig&rsquo;s post&ndash;Thanks Craig!&ndash;uses the word &lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; for the quality of Didot, but I think it&rsquo;s the same thing that I call &lsquo;dazzle&rsquo;. And her point above supports my view, which as I said is probably not coincidental, since Lieberman talked to her and I talked to Lieberman.</p>
<p>And, not coincidentally, Caslon did some things that are unusually good for defeating the &lsquo;picket fence&rsquo; and reducing dazzle, while retaining a lively dance of shapes. That liveliness without dazzle is what I was going for in Williams Caslon Text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Craig, certainly, as Warde said, the antiquarian connotations of the Victorian old style lessened as it became more widely used in later 19th century book work. But the upscale, literary, vibe did not disappear, and is with us to this day.</p>
<p><em>I’ve been reading for 60 years..</em></p>
<p>And distinguishing between moderns and old styles the whole time?
Bill, your recent personal experience is irrelevant in a discussion of the 19th and early 20th century.
I don&rsquo;t believe I am &ldquo;going against the weight of typographic tradition&rdquo;: I&rsquo;ve studied many publications from the era and formed my own conclusions based on what I see, rather than taking Updike&rsquo;s extremely biased word.</p>
<p>Your talk of dazzle and picket fences in relation to the modern style identifies a problem the style has encountered during the 20th century&ndash;and Dwiggins comments on it, thanks Kent. Over-mechanical drawing/rendering, on the one hand, and inappropriate printing techniques. But these technical issues are not an issue of the style per se, and dog all typefaces that are repurposed for new media.</p>
<p>The modern was a sophisticated style of typeface finely tuned to printing and cultural conditions during the 19th century. The Scotch Modern addressed the issues that the first moderns of Didot and Bodoni raised. In this page from 1854, it&rsquo;s apparent that there is plenty of horizontal presence&ndash;note especially the magnificent top serif on &ldquo;d&rdquo;, and the strong horizontal bottom of &ldquo;m&rdquo; and top of &ldquo;w&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Modern_5580.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Scotch Modern was (and is) a face with excellent readability, no need to knock it to bolster your Caslon, Bill, which should be able to stand on its own feet.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take the initiative to &ldquo;knock&rdquo; Scotch or even to mention it. You took the initiative to bring it up and to defend it.</p>
<p>I was explaining, in answer to Peter&rsquo;s question, why I thought Caslon was tops in reading comfort&ndash;a view which certainly I didn&rsquo;t originate. I gave my theory with reference to Moderns, like Bodoni.</p>
<p>As you brought up Scotch designs, such as you have beautifully revived, I said, yes, my eyes and my theory say that the Scotch style is a more comfortable read than Modern, but less so than letter press Caslon. And your example certainly doesn&rsquo;t change my mind.</p>
<p>And I have acknowledged that no scientific test as yet exists as to who is right about this.</p>
<p>I was simply explaining the theory behind my work, in answer to a question.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we agree to disagree, without personal accusations?</p>

<p>Bill, I spent a lot of time reviving Scotch Modern which is a modern face and undoubtedly tarred by any brush which disses moderns.
No problem with you explaining your preferences and creative process, but you made certain inaccurate historical statements which I sought to correct.
Why bring Bodoni into this (other than it being an easy target for old-style readability advocates), as you had been talking about the Caslon revival, which occurred at the time when the Scotch Modern was the dominant text style.</p>
<p><em>If Nick would simply restate his dogged belief that Modern was more readable back then merely and only because it was more popular, there would be no reason to argue.</em></p>
<p>Still flogging that straw man, eh Hrant?</p>
<p>I know you like to reduce things to simplisitic ideological confrontation, but I try to be more realistic and simply ask those who diss the modern (and Scotch Modern) style for being inferior to the old style&rsquo;s &ldquo;superior&rdquo; readability, and going on about dazzle and picket fences and other such nonsense: &ldquo;How could anything with such readability issues become so popular and effective?&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t anybody back then notice how uncomfortable they were reading it?</p>
<p>If anything Hrant, I would say that you have got the relationship between readability and popularity backwards: wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense that types become popular because people (and not just readers, but those in the all aspects of the publishing/information industry) find them readable, not the other way round?</p>
<p>Such a homeostatic process would be particularly operative in advertising, a sort of natural selection: if potential consumers are uncomfortable reading marketing messages, they will not buy the product&ndash;therefore the most readable types will evolve and flourish, supported by the advertising budgets they help generate.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you were on the same page concerning readability*, the answer(s) would be obvious: few people would notice (because it&rsquo;s not a conscious thing, and it&rsquo;s not like your eyes fall out) and a tiny proportion of those will have ideas of how to improve things. People have their lives - they don&rsquo;t do type. That&rsquo;s what type designers are for.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re behind; you burned the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>And no, obviously type rarely becomes popular because it&rsquo;s more readable; readers just read, they don&rsquo;t know how it works, hence how to improve it. That&rsquo;s what type designers are for. Natural selection? You need mutations first. That&rsquo;s what type designers are for. And the good ones don&rsquo;t just mutate formalisms.</p>
<p>But honestly, again: Why are you having this discussion when all you have to do is candidly state that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern was most readable because it was read most.</li>
<li>Things only moved away from Modern because it became less fashionable.</li>

<p>Initially when talking about this I spoke of &ldquo;high contrast&rdquo; faces, not Modern or Scotch. I only mentioned Bodoni when you brought in M &amp; R Old style and called it Modern. I pointed out that it wasn&rsquo;t Modern in this sense, as the contrast, as well as proportions were significantly more Old Style, as the name indicates.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your statement that M &amp; R Old Style is &ldquo;modern in its high contrast.&rdquo; As you can see in Mosley&rsquo;s sample or my example above of Bruce Old Style, it is not high contrast, compared to Didones or Scotchs.</li>
<li>Your acknowledged mistake of claiming that no Newspaper type before 1950 was Old Style&ndash;ignoring Times New Roman.</li>

<p>Hang on a sec. I was careful to qualify that I think there are readability issues with <em>some</em> Didone style types, and I didn&rsquo;t say anything about extended text. I think we do agree about the danger of the ‘picket fence’ effect, but it is just that: a danger, not a necessary result of the style. I do think that types with more or less extreme stroke contrast need to be handled with, frankly, a lot more care than one needs with a lower contrast type. Types with high contrast do not scale well, and generally need to be used fairly close to an optimal design size. It is worth noting, by the way, that both French use of Didot types and English use of Scotch Roman types, for extended text, tended to be very small by modern typography standards. At these sizes, the metal types have a much lower stroke contrast than we generally associate with these styles as they have been made familiar to us in modern advertising versions. Here, for example, is an Imprimerie Firmin Didot use of one of the family types in 1825:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Didot1825as_4499.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And enlarged approx. 300%:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Didot1825e_5712.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read 19th Century English books set in similar sizes of Scotch Roman and, well, I read them. It wasn&rsquo;t difficult. Might they have been easier to read in Caslon <em>at the same size?</em> Possibly. I&rsquo;ve got specimens of Caslon&rsquo;s smaller roman types, as printed by his grandson, and of the recut, and they are nicely legible, but I don&rsquo;t think there is so much difference as to be very significant during reading.</p>
<p>I think we often overlook the increase in typical sizes for book typography in the 20th Century as compared to the 19th. And I think that the ‘picket fence’ phenomenon in high contrast types is more likely to occur at larger text sizes than at smaller, and especially if the type used is really optimised for a larger size still, which is often the case with modern versions of this style.</p>

<p>By the time Caslon re-appeared, it was mid-century and the high contrast Didones were long gone The comparison between the recast Caslon and the standard Scotch Moderns of the time was not a miracle about basic readability, the miracle was one of antiquarian quaintness, complete with long &ldquo;s&rdquo; and quaint ligatures. (Which I must admit do, in their own way, provide a form of readability.)</p>
<p>The point I was making is that the distinction between the moderns and old styles of the latter half of the 19th century is not about contrast or colour, as to all intents and purposes there is no difference.</p>
<p>Re. Times, I was being a bit extreme in saying that there were no old style news text faces, but even the exception, Times, is not what one would call a typical oldstyle, certainly in its high contrast, after all, you put great store in low contrast as being a marker of the old style.</p>

<p>In the end I think readability is as well very much influenced from what we&rsquo;ve learned to be used to. Not only and exclusively, but to a big extend.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, I agree that, if discussing readability, it is better to analyse a) particular characteristics such as contrast strength and orientation and b) how these are applied in particular types in particular sizes and media, rather than trying to talk in general terms about styles of type. Nick and Bill seems to be arguing about history as much as they are arguing about readability, so I think it makes sense to look at the actual types at the actual sizes and actual media that constitute the physical artefacts of that history. And I think the evidence of those types is that Bill is wrong when he writes ‘&hellip;the high contrast types of the early nineteenth century were less readable, and that as a result Caslon seemed somewhat of a miracle when it re-appeared’. This is sloppy history in a number of ways. In the first place, as Nick notes, romantic types of extreme contrast &ndash; and continental provenance &ndash; had given way to lower contrast domestic types of the Scotch Roman style; in the second place, the Scotch Roman types continued to be in widespread use long after the Caslon revival began in the 1840s, and continued to be used until tastes swung not to Caslon but to the Italian renaissance inspired types of Kelmscott, Doves, Ashendene and other private presses at the end of the century*; in the third place, I doubt if a direct contemporary comparison was possible at the time of the Caslon revival, because I doubt if Caslon was ever used as small as type in the typical mass market books of the day: the Caslon revival occurred in the context of private press publishing, using larger formats and larger type sizes.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most typographically humorous books I ever owned was a 1904 Chiswick Press edition of Apuleius. It, like the uniform Chiswick books of that period, was printed in a large text size of Caslon roman heavily over-inked and deeply impressed into thick rag paper to make it look like a Morris Italianate type. Very funny, especially in the context of this discussion.</li>

<p>This is the back cover of an issue of the <em>Delineator</em> magazine, c.1890, one of the first mass-circulation magazines in the US. The text type is quite large. It&rsquo;s a very understated form of advertisement.</p>
<p>There were two kinds of advertising text, recognized in 1917 by Gilbert P. Farrar in <em>Typography of Advertising that Pays</em> as the Forceful Educational Style and the Passive Educational Style, described thus: 
&ldquo;When there are no headlines [and usually, be it noted, no logo] the reader reads the entire advertisement or he does not read any part of it, and this very fact causes the copy to get a reading from the better class of readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Victorian old style is used here for text, in a delicate &ldquo;optically sized&rdquo; cut, for that upscale connotation.
It&rsquo;s unlikely that such an ad would be set in a modern, or that the reader would read the entire advertisement if it were set in a modern, because that would have been at odds with the &ldquo;passive&rdquo; tone and genre of the piece.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not book or editorial text matter, but it does demonstrate how the readability of a typeface is sensitive to context, and not merely an abstract rating.</p>

I am very familiar with the kiss impression. It was what we were taught back in our youth. You are referring to letterpress craftsman who labored to create an even inking with no blemishes and a crisp edge without any embossing on the back. What I called Letterpress &ldquo;Snobs&rdquo; are the modern-day wannabbes who &lsquo;need&rsquo; people to notice they use letterpress for cache so they crush the poor type and render it useless for the next job. Their motto is &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t read it like Braille then add more packing&rdquo;. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When it comes to Caslon, when I first saw it in a type specimen book (Kelsey&rsquo;s), I thought it was a terrible-looking font, not useful for anything besides ostentatious old-style display. But when I look at the first printed version of the Declaration of Independence, I see a beautiful and readable typeface.</p>
<p>So I strongly agree with the notion that Caslon is a font with too much stroke contrast, susceptible to improvement from a &ldquo;sock&rdquo; impression as opposed to a &ldquo;kiss&rdquo; impression.</p>
<p>While I also won&rsquo;t deny that there were some beautiful and readable Scotch Romans, though, my personal impression of 19th-century typography is that most of it was horrid. Either one had a beautiful and readable Scotch Roman being used at sizes from 6 point to 4 1/2 point&hellip; or one had, from 8 to 10 points, a condensed and anemic and ugly version of Scotch Roman. Yes, oldstyle typefaces don&rsquo;t have an <em>inherent</em> monopoly on readability, and Caledonia wasn&rsquo;t the <em>first</em> readable Modern typeface&hellip; but the general situation was such that the Caslon revival can legitimately be considered a &ldquo;breath of fresh air&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The transition to more readable typography wasn&rsquo;t borne mostly on the shoulders of Caslon - or of the Baskerville revival after World War I - or even on Ronaldson Oldstyle, Century Oldstyle, and similar faces. I do think that Baskerville - and Garamond - both played a significant role in the 20th Century. But the true standard-bearer of the improvement in readability over 19th Century standards was the humble workhorse Century Expanded. There were 19th Century Scotch Romans as good or better than it in readability, but they weren&rsquo;t what was usually used. And, yes, Century Expanded is still a little on the condensed side. But it still represented a passable standard of readability - and a very good <em>minimum</em> standard of readability - compared to the execrable readability of a lot of Victorian typography.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to concede that the <em>real</em> blame for this lies less with inherent design flaws in the class of Scotch Roman faces than with a tendency towards excessive parsimony in the use of paper. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that one will see in that era&rsquo;s typography a lot of Scotch Roman faces which were definitely inferior to Caslon in readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, let me start with your specimen of Didot. To avoid poor readability it compensates for the limitations of the type by having huge word spaces and a large amount of leading. If you tried to set this with less leading and tighter word spaces the &lsquo;dazzle&rsquo; would be much worse. As it is, I still find it annoying, but it is readable. In talking about greater and lesser reading comfort, I am not talking about a huge difference, but I am talking about a difference that people do experience, such as in the story that &lsquo;flooce&rsquo; tells above&ndash;thanks flooce!</p>
<p>As to my comments on history, first let me say that Nick&rsquo;s claim that I compared Caslon  only to Bodoni, ignoring that Scotch was around mid-century in England, is a straw man. I never said it. As to my holding that the change from higher contrast to lower contrast text faces took place because of readability, I did indeed say that to Peter, above. And I acknowledged that this is my explanation of the history, not a fact that I can easily document. But I did note that Updike seems to be of that view. He was born in 1860, and so was reading and then printing through the last part of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Even more revealing is Theodore Low De Vinne, in an essay I just looked up. He was born in 1828, and so was reading throughout the period we are talking about. He is revered as the most important printer and scholar of printing in the 19th century in America. Goudy said he was his &ldquo;greatest single influence&rdquo; and Matthew Carter recently in the video from Type Berlin said, IIRC, that De Vinne is a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; to him.</p>
<p>Here is De Vinne talking about Bodoni, around the turn of the twentieth century:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The over-sharp hair-line, the dazzling serif, and the vanishing curve are more irritating in the smaller than in the larger sizes. Ordinary eyesight does not seize at a glance the entire face of modern type; it dimly sees hair-lines or serifs; it deciphers the stems only; it sees but half of the letter, and guesses at the invisible. The type of Bodoni is a wearing strain on the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(from &ldquo;The Old and the New&rdquo;&ndash;and written like a true Typophile :)</p>
<p>Now mind you this is a man who not only lived through the transition to use of Old Styles, but also was a printer and made it happen. The same with Updike.</p>
<p>Nick, you have attempted to paint my views about the dazzle of modern types, and Scotch&ndash;less so but still a problem&ndash;as some kind of stupid eccentricity of mine. But as all can see from this quote, this is just flat wrong. I am but the latest in a long history and large number of people serious about type who have found the same problem in modern types for text, for well over a hundred years.</p>
<p>John, I do not know the details of the history, but from the evidence of De Vinne, who did know and participated in it, the idea that high contrast types were rejected in favor of lower contrast types partly for reasons of readability is pretty plausible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let me emphasize that with my Williams Caslon Text the idea that high contrast is a problem was only a starting point, and one of several starting ideas at that. The key issue is not simply contrast, but how exactly it is distributed and oriented in the glyphs. This distribution of contrast is an important factor affecting readability, in my view, and I have made an effort here to handle it, as well as a number of other factors, in a way that gives high comfort in reading.</p>
<p>ps. Quadribloc: Yes, Caslon looked best printed letter press on rough paper, so there was significant ink spread, and lower contrast than the metal face. I think it looked best not with the 18th century splochy ink spread, but printed with the 19th and early 20th century printing methods; that printed version is what I was influenced by in this design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, Updike was an extremely biased historian, whose agenda, like De Vinne&rsquo;s was to improve the trade printing of his era, which he considered lacking in taste, and to this end he sought to apply to it the standards of the fine book tradition. That is why he denigrated the modern face and ignored the sans serif.</p>
<p>William Morris and Theodore De Vinne were both in their 60s when advocating sturdier type forms, so when De Vinne speaks of &ldquo;ordinary eyesight&rdquo;, one wonders, ordinary for what age of reader?</p>
<p><em>I am but the latest in a long history and large number of people serious about type who have found the same problem in modern types for text, for well over a hundred years.</em></p>
<p>I am one of them. I rarely specified it for text, as it was apt to blow up in my face (This was with phototype in the 1980s and digital in the 1990s). It can be a difficult style to work with, whether as type designer, typographer, or printer. The old style is more forgiving, and for various cultural and technological reasons, has been a safer bet for that last 100 years. Nonetheless, I don&rsquo;t believe the problem is with the style per se but with the execution. Dwiggins was of the same opinion.</p>
<p>There is a lot of bad modern text from the 19th century, to our eyes, because it was printed on chemically pulped paper that is now brown and brittle. But I&rsquo;ve also seen a great deal of superb work, and that quality is what I&rsquo;ve tried to bring to the 21st century with my Scotch Modern revival, remedying the technical issues involved in adapting the genre to today&rsquo;s media, rather than abandoning it in favor of the old style.</p>

<p>Human beings have a tendency to denigrate the things that they wish replaced with things more in accord with their own tastes, ideals or philosophies, and the easiest way to denigrate a typeface is to say that it is difficult to read, despite the evidence of people reading it.</p>

<p>The answer is first of all that the &lsquo;less readable&rsquo; is a matter of reading comfort, and I am talking about relatively small, but still significant differences. In the face of those relatively small differences, fashion can easily override comfort, particularly if people don&rsquo;t really understand clearly what makes for more and less comfort.</p>
<p>We can see this phenomenon in shoes. Very uncomfortable shoes have been fashionable at one time or another, and high heals for women, which are damaging to feet, are still popular&ndash;though there has been some feminist rage against them.</p>
<p>In the case of type there are two more reasons why a less comfortable type would persist for a long time. First, there is the expense of changing. Creating type at that time was a very expensive undertaking, and I believe the necessary expense of buying many fonts of a type for setting extended text needed to be amortized over a long period for economic reasons.</p>
<p>As second reason is that people didn&rsquo;t necessarily understand what the problem was. Bodoni did and still does look great in display&ndash;and doesn&rsquo;t have problems with readability. Thus it is easy to make the mistake of thinking it can do a well in text also. And it looks attractive in text as well, when you look at individual words&ndash;though it is more uncomfortable to read. By doing things like a lot of leading and big word spaces, they did make it serviceable, though the problems remained. My view is that by the end of the 19th century, a number of people&ndash;including obviously De Vinne&ndash;were convinced that high contrast was a real problem for text, and that reducing contrast for text types would help.</p>
<p>Hence the change, which as I say was not fundamentally about old style stress, but about contrast and its handling.</p>

<p>No, because they are reading a page setting, not a font.
Nonetheless, choice of font is important within the concept of the page/document as a whole.
A good typographer knows how to spark a reader&rsquo;s interest and hold it.
There are also conventions in different genres.</p>
<p>If you were to research &ldquo;graphic design&rdquo;, you would find that your understanding of the way that typography works is at odds with the way it is taught and practiced. 
Could this be because you think the design establishment is a bunch of &ldquo;posers and failed artistes&rdquo;?</p>

<p>FYI, my &ldquo;research&rdquo; has revealed something most people here know: most graphic designers don&rsquo;t have a sufficiently good handle on type, especially not text type. They use Mrs Eaves for a book and never even realize what&rsquo;s wrong. The ones that hang out here are the commendable minority.</p>

The point is, the readability of the page is dependent on the design of the page. 
Therefore, the graphic designer chooses a typeface to work with the layout.
Therefore, one genre of type will be more readable in a certain kind of layout, and a different genre elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>most graphic designers don’t have a sufficiently good handle on type,</em></p>
<p>This is something that educators struggle with too.
Teaching a third-year course, I&rsquo;ve found that students have forgotten much of what they were taught in Type 1&ndash;typography is a small part of graphic design, and in between they were wrestling with logo design, web design, animation, etc.</p>

<p>Well of course. It depends on dozens of things. Not least of which however is the human reading &ldquo;hardware&rdquo;; things like the acuity patterns of the retina, the way the brain stores and uses information, etc. We are not ethereal beings - we have physical limitations; and design -especially text face design- is in large part about this, not one insignificant individual&rsquo;s mere self-expression, not mere faddish navel-gazing.</p>
<p>But anyway: the specific problem right here right now is that what you said above is ludicrous.</p>

<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something wrong, at least in some courses, maybe most? When style is given too much weight, it takes away from other things. Maybe the teacher should have at least a faint grasp of readability?</p>
<p>Just because ignorance is popular doesn&rsquo;t make it OK.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>About the Franklin quote. Yes, Franklin played a trick on the fellow who didn&rsquo;t like Baskerville, by revealing that he was doing what is now called &ldquo;bolstering&rdquo; in the psychological literature on decision-making.</p>
<p>Psychologists have found that before we make a decision, we are often quite uncertain as to what is correct. But after the decision, we tend to look for reasons to justify the decision, or even distort reality to make the decision &lsquo;right&rsquo; in our own eyes. And we suddenly become much more certain about the options, and that we have made the right choice.</p>
<p>But the Franklin quote cuts two ways. Yes, the fellow was wrong in this case seeing what wasn&rsquo;t there. But why did he complain about the readability of Baskerville? There is no knock against old styles as being unreadable. The complaint by advocates of the &lsquo;modern&rsquo; was that that old styles were ungainly or ugly, not unreadable. This shows to me that from the beginning of increased contrast&ndash;and Baskerville I believe is the beginning&ndash;the problems with readability were noticed. But what was and is debatable for Baskerville, especially letter press Baskerville, is an enduring knock against Bodoni, both letter press and digital, for well over a century.</p>
<p>All this evidence is dismissed by Nick in an extraordinary display of irrational bolstering, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned. He says that M &amp; R Old Style, which is relatively low contrast is high contrast. He ignores scientific evidence as nonsense. And he dismisses all the criticism of high contrast faces as due to an evil bias against advertising. But when it comes to his own Scotch Modern, and draws text and micro sizes for it, what does he do? Reduce contrast, like everybody else. And earlier on Typophile when I raised the issue of &lsquo;dazzle&rsquo;, he said, it exists and you can control it, and gave the example of his Eunoia as a type where he exploited it&ndash;and the picket fence illusion, if you look at the type&ndash;to get dazzle. When challenged by Hrant to produce a &lsquo;text&rsquo; version of Eunoia what does he do? Reduce contrast. But now suddenly my concerns about contrast and dazzle are just ridiculous fantasies.</p>
<p>John, I don&rsquo;t know what exactly your view is on this. You have said, IIRC, that &lsquo;readerability&rsquo; is so powerful that readability of type is not normally an issue in type design. But you acknowledge that the picket fence effect is a danger and problem in latin type. But why is it a problem if not because it reduces reading comfort?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I never really followed-up on that (and not because I didn&rsquo;t know how). The results -and Nick&rsquo;s defense of them- were quite telling. The challenge was to make a &ldquo;text cut&rdquo; of Eunoia, with Nick claiming it would be a walk in the park. The result was not something almost anybody would call a text face (somebody was leaning on populism?); and it wasn&rsquo;t a text face; and my point had been that if it were made into a text face, it would no longer be Eunoia. A design has, yes, <em>style</em> attributes that make it a display face or a text face - and you can&rsquo;t cross the border without making it no longer that typeface. Baskerville is effectively not the same font at 10 versus 72 point.</p>
<p>Anyway this should really be picked back up there, not here.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one way of describing it, but that wasn&rsquo;t my rationale. What I was trying to do was keep the thickness of the hairlines/serifs consistent across a scale of optical sizes. Of course, the size ratio seen here would vary depending on ink gain.</p>

<p>Completely intentional on my part. :)</p>
<p><em>You have said, IIRC, that ’readerability’ is so powerful that readability of type is not normally an issue in type design. But you acknowledge that the picket fence effect is a danger and problem in latin type. But why is it a problem if not because it reduces reading comfort?</em></p>
<p>Not a danger <em>and</em> a problem, but a danger of a problem. I think Nick nailed it when he wrote: [<em>high contrast</em>] <em>can be a difficult style to work with, whether as type designer, typographer, or printer. The old style is more forgiving, and for various cultural and technological reasons, has been a safer bet for that last 100 years. Nonetheless, I don’t believe the problem is with the style per se but with the execution. Dwiggins was of the same opinion.</em></p>
<p>This is the same point I tried to make earlier, regarding the relative difficulty and danger posed by the high contrast styles. They do need to be used at something very close to an optimal size for each cut, which has not been the case with much photo and digital typography in these styles; they benefit from increased linespacing; most of the over-rationalised revivals really are only suited to display work. And yet, it has been possible to produce typography in this style that was readably, beautiful and, perhaps most importantly, expressed the literary and aesthetic culture of the time in which these types flourished. This latter point is something that we tend to overlook, from an age in which we have access to almost limitless styles of type, can easily produce new styles, and whose literary culture is deliberately fractured.</p>
<p>Regarding linespacing, you wrote: <em>By doing things like a lot of leading and big word spaces, they did make it serviceable, though the problems remained.</em></p>
<p>I think you are wrong about what is happening in romantic typography (e.g. the Firmin Didot example I posted above). It is not as if they had these difficult types and had to invent a way of typesetting them that made them ‘serviceable’ for reading. Rather, they were developing a typographic aesthetic which included both page layout and styles of types appropriate to those layouts and to the literary ideals that they embodied. Indeed, the large linespacing aesthetic <em>precedes</em> the development of the romantic types and is applied independently of them. One sees it in Fournier&rsquo;s <em>Manuel</em> &ndash; not in the text-heavy and technically oriented first volume, but very much so in the second, specimen volume &ndash;, used with his medium-contrast oblique-stress baroque types. Bodoni uses large linespacing for everything he touches, regardless of type style or even writing system.</p>
<p>[Perhaps not surprisingly, I see precursors to romantic linespacing in the work of writing masters, long before the romantic period. Recall that in the 17th Century, Flemish and French scribes are producing works with elaborated extenders and flourishes, necessitating a lot of space between the lines of text. The Flemish masters are using a rotating broad nib, and the French are using split nibs, but play with contrast and the overall complexity of the page are similar. Arguably, what happens in the course of the 18th century is not that linespacing increases but that extenders retreat.]</p>

<p>Rubbish. The micro type is designed to work in quoted matter and footnotes, with the normal, where the equalized hairline detail of both forms a uniform threshold, as it were, of perceptible detail, a solid ground which anchors the visual presence of the page as a whole.</p>
<p>This, I think, is the underlying principle of optical scaling in all contrasted-stem serifed genres, and the idea of &ldquo;decreasing contrast as type size gets smaller&rdquo; is mistaken, being an incidental, secondary effect.</p>
<p><em>They do need to be used at something very close to an optimal size for each cut, which has not been the case with much photo and digital typography in these styles&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Very true. 
Finely rendered old styles such as Bembo and Perpetua have also suffered as digital text fonts, but their often emaciated effect has not been considered as fatal as Bodoni&rsquo;s notorious dazzle, or as symptomatic of the genre as a whole. Perhaps because there have always been plenty of other, sturdier old styles available, and because high contrast is considered to be a hallmark of the modern genre, disqualifying faces such as the Centuries from belonging.</p>

<p>High contrast never causes a readability problem with small type?</p>
<p>If you say yes, it never does, I think you are wrong. If you say &lsquo;no&rsquo;, in some cases high contrast causes problems, then I think you have to acknowledge that &lsquo;readerability&rsquo; has limits as to comfort relating to contrast, even with otherwise competent design.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are you saying that as traditionally adjusted for contrast and set as it was, Bodoni is equally comfortable to read in extended text as a well set old style?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you say yes, I would side with De Vinne, who, remember, did print letter press during the 19th century. I think Bodoni is readable, but there are problems with comfort in reading it in text.</p>
<p>On the issue of leading, are you now claiming that if you set it tightly it will be fine also, and this way of setting was mere a cultural norm? I thought you conceded the opposite: that setting it tightly will cause problems with reading comfort.</p>
<p>Also your historical claims don&rsquo;t match what I have seen. As far as I&rsquo;ve seen Caslon was generally set solid in the 18th Century. I saw acres of it set that way in the [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/The_Gentleman%27s_Magazine%2C_May_1759.jpg|Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine]] (England), and here in the US [[http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/PoorRichards.jpg|Poor Richard&rsquo;s Almanac]] and [[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/displayPhoto.pl?path=/service/rbc/rbc0001/2004/2004pe76546&amp;topImages=001r.jpg&amp;topLinks=001v.jpg,001u.tif,001a.tif,001.tif&amp;displayProfile=0|the Declaration of Independence]], all set solid in old style, the Declaration of Independence definitely Caslon, and the others I believe so as far as the text. And they do not have such broad word spacing.</p>
<p>So are you saying that the old style printing in France, of say Garamond types was set equally loose as the romantic types? The famous [[http://image.linotype.com/images/thumbnails/egenolff_berner.jpg|Berner Specimen]] is set solid.</p>
<p>Or is it that printing history of the 18th century old styles is irrelevant?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thicker thins is only one of the many things a designer needs to do when making type for smaller sizes. And it&rsquo;s not merely the absolute thickness of the thins on paper that matters; the various relationships within a font affect readability fundamentally. This is why a given Modern can have the same weight contrast as a given Oldstyle but still be less readable in toto. In fact I would state that you can have the thinnest parts disappear completely in an otherwise very well-crafted font, and still have something more readable than the results from a poorly designed font where the thins are &ldquo;thick enough&rdquo;. How is this possible? Reading is much much more complex than putting together letters.</p>
<p>But most significantly, it&rsquo;s not merely about discrete features surviving certain output conditions; a typeface can have features that are serious impediments to readability, no matter how well technical compensations are made. This is why I chose Eunoia: it couldn&rsquo;t survive, and it didn&rsquo;t. The things that make it Eunoia prevent it from being an immersive text face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I&rsquo;m talking about styles of letters. There is a style of letters &ndash; which I call Romantic, and others call Modern or Didone &ndash;, based on extreme interpretation of the split nib contrast construction, of which strong verticals and hairline horizontals are a characteristic feature. As Bringhurst has noted, they are the typographic equivalents of fortissimo and pianissimo in Romantic music. If you want to understand the difference between Caslon and Walbaum, listen to Handel and Beethoven and pay particular attention to dynamics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to state any more clearly than I have that types in this style need careful handling and, in particular, that they need to be used at or close to optimal sizes of particular cuts. So your questions don&rsquo;t make sense to me. Do I think high contrast ever causes a readability problem with small type? Well of course, if the contrast is inappropriate to the size. But I&rsquo;m not talking about some fixed level of contrast, but about styles of letters, which are adaptable to different sizes by modulation of their contrast (as are most styles of letters). In practice, you increase the weight of the hairlines as the type gets smaller (along with other modifications to letter proportion). And yes, as you will doubtless point out &ndash; Aha! &ndash; this means that you are reducing the contrast. Yes, but you are not changing the style of the letter: it is still a Romantic type, based on a particular construction. And within that style, the weight of the hairline increases or decreases relative to size. That&rsquo;s how its done, and that&rsquo;s how you avoid problems with readability resulting from contrast.</p>
<hr>
<p>Re. linespacing: you seem to have got hold of the wrong end of this stick. I&rsquo;m talking about the development of <em>Romantic typography</em> and its precursors, i.e. those elements of baroque and neo-classical lettering and typography that fed directly into the aesthetic of Romanticism. So of course I&rsquo;m not talking about the contemporary but distinct typography of solid-set Caslon and other oldstyle types, which are the tail end of renaissance typography &ndash; from Garamond, to Plantin, to the Dutch oldstyle, to Caslon &ndash; overlapping with the beginnings of Romanticism. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t think I would need to explain that.</p>
<p>You made a statement that implied that the page layout characteristics of Romantic typography somehow came into being to make the Romantic types ‘serviceable’. I was pointing out &ndash; with examples &ndash; that these characteristics pre-date the types. If anything, one can look at the types of Bodoni and Didot as being created to compliment the page aesthetic. Together, the types and the page layout gave shape to Romantic typography, and gave fitting form to Romantic literature. And I don&rsquo;t think any Romantic writer would have thanked you for setting his book in Caslon, however readable.</p>

<p>Bill, didn&rsquo;t you see that link earlier in this thread which I gave to the specimen from James Mosley&rsquo;s blog?
Does that look like low contrast to you?
Unfortunately, all my books and magazines are in boxes at the moment, so I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t post a better specimen.</p>
<p>As for bolstering, I form my opinions from looking at first hand evidence, and from my experience as an art director, graphic designer and type designer.</p>
<p>Updike et al were all bolsterers&ndash;they wanted to raise the tone of typography, to make commercial design more classy, which explains their historicist bent, penchant for old style types, and antipathy towards the modern style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, on the subject of the historical progression from Garamond via the Dutch to Caslon, I think that what Dutch type makers, notably Fleischmann and Rosart, did contemporaneously with Caslon is much more interesting and shows a vitality that Caslon only approached, I suspect accidentally, in his display sizes. Caslon&rsquo;s text type, of which I have an early 19th Century specimen on the wall behind me as I write, is at once admirably readable and, frankly, incredibly dull.</div>

<p>Big deal - almost any font is. That logic leads to a useless definition of &ldquo;text font&rdquo;. Eunoia-Text is not a magazine face, not a news face, not a face that any semi-decent typographer would use for more than a few lines. And a few lines are plenty readable with all but the most decorative faces. In fact a few lines can be done fine with the original display Eunoia! :-)</p>
<p>But most of all, if you admit that Eunoia could not be made into a &ldquo;book face&rdquo; (while remaining recognizable as Eunoia) then you have in effect finally conceded the point I made in my previous post (and many times in the past).</p>

Nick Shinn&rsquo;s Eunoia Text isn&rsquo;t such an extreme case as that, it clearly is a variant of the original typeface. But since his point can be stretched to cover that case, if you allow the typeface to be changed at all (instead of making the font legible through leading and the like) it&rsquo;s unclear to me what the point of this debate is.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, the ability to change a typeface to make it readable wasn&rsquo;t the issue. The issue was whether or not typeface designers needed to refer to scientific studies of legibility before they could design readable typefaces. Oh, wait. Nicholas Jenson and Aldus Manutilus both died before they had scientific studies of legibility. Nick Shinn wins again!</p>
<p>In other words, if one notes that the point apparently at issue can be split into two components, which are trivially obvious, we seem to be left with two possibilities (plus, of course, miscommunication which basically led to a combination of their consequences): either Hrant Papazian didn&rsquo;t express his point clearly, whatever it really was, or Nick Shinn managed to refute a strawman.</p>
<p>Of course, this excludes from consideration the possibility that Mr. Papazian just goes around and says obviously silly things; <em>that</em> is a claim of which I would need a lot of convincing before I would consider it.</p>

<p>No, Nina, your eyes are not different from everyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The complaints about higher contrast type, as we have seen, go back for over two hundred years. Obviously, a lot of other designers also did not find these complaints valid. De Vinne&rsquo;s lovely essay I quoted above, has the full title, &ldquo;The Old and the New: A Friendly Dispute between Juvenis &amp; Senex&rdquo; It is a debate on the same issues as we are having here, written over a hundred years ago, with some of the same arguments on both sides.</p>
<p>My problem with your arguments, Nick and John, is that you dismiss contrary evidence. My theory is that readability had something to do with the revival of lower contrast types. I don&rsquo;t know what percent of the switch was caused by this issue and what percent by aesthetics, but how can you say that De Vinne&rsquo;s opinion, a man who was actually one of those doing the reviving, is to be dismissed as irrelevant? He <em>is</em> part of the history, and you have his words there saying that readability is a big issue for him with modern style types.</p>
<p>Nick, you imply that De Vinne didn&rsquo;t see what he says he sees, and instead just has an animus against advertising. This argument is to me ridiculously forced, especially given that the complaint about high contrast type is a long lasting, widespread phenomenon, and is not simply an issue with digital type. Now I am really curious to read more of De Vinne, as he wrote quite a lot.</p>
<p>A plain reading of the history is that many have actually found high contrast hard to read in text. Just let me refer to a couple of more examples. De Vinne&rsquo;s essay appears in the lovely collection of essays <em>Books and Printing: a Treasury for Typophiles</em> edited by Paul Bennett. The different essays are printed in a different typefaces, a total of 21 typefaces, to suit the outlook of the authors. In the appendix, we have a comment on AFT&rsquo;s Bodoni Book:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Introduced in 1910, it is not a copy of the types of the great Italian, Giambattista Bodoni, but rather a version retaining his principle of modern letter design. The lessened degree of contrast between its thick and thin lines make it gain in reading ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is presumably written by Paul Bennett, the editor, and Director of Typography for Merganthaler Linotype for thirty years.</p>
<p>One more. Currently, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni|wikipedia article on Bodoni]] goes on and on about the &ldquo;dazzle&rdquo; (their quotes) caused by digital Bodonis, and claims that Filosophia cures it.</p>
<p>But, as we see the complaints about Bodoni and dazzle long pre-date digital type.</p>
<p>Nick, yes I am saying that in the Old Style in Mosley&rsquo;s sample there is markedly lower contrast than in Bodoni or Scotch Modern types. And the difference is obvious can be confirmed with hard numbers.</p>
<p>I suspect that you are making the mistake of attending only to the thins. But this is only one part of the comparison, the other being how thick the thicks are. Contrast is the <em>ratio</em> of thick to thin. In &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; the reduction in contrast is achieved not by increasing the thins of past types, but rather by reducing the thick stems&ndash;and changing the proportions in the process.</p>
<p>The problem with high contrast type, in my view, is not simply a matter of the thins objectively being too small. The eye and brain I believe &lsquo;tune&rsquo; to a type to pick up clues in a mental grid they place over the letters. And when some cues are <em>relatively</em> too thin the eye-brain combination has to work harder to process them. That&rsquo;s in a nutshell why Caslon is a more comfortable read than Bodoni at text sizes.</p>
<p>In my view the Fourier transforms of type show this tuning of type design to match the capacities of the eye and brain, so there is definitely something of this sort going on. Whether it applies to contrast is debatable, but plausible, especially given the complaints about high contrast over hundreds of years, which I think it is absurd to dismiss as prejudice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, but this post is too long already, and I&rsquo;ve got a deadline to meet.</p>

<p>Some.
My key point here is that: the more display a font is, and the more you want to approach text (specifically, cross a threshold where it can/will be used for something more than a paragraph!) the more of the style you lose. And in this case (in fact Nick hints at this) my view is that what makes Eunoia Eunoia prevents it from becoming a text face. I think most people agree with this net result - even though they might not grasp how it got there.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That would be a ridiculous issue. For one thing, we&rsquo;re not talking about unreadable stuff*; we&rsquo;re talking about display versus text, and how much bearing (never absolute) science should have on design. A good designer: does not ignore empiricism; but nonetheless does not let the absence of empiricism prevent him from trying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider this: what is unreadable, exactly?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>either Hrant Papazian didn’t express his point clearly, whatever

<p>There is stuff in between. Why? Because communication is a two-way street; the degree to which a person can be understood depends a great deal on the listener. I trust that you&rsquo;re a good listener, and strong enough to potentially change your mind.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read french books set very similarly to the one John showed (old yellow paper included) and whenever I look at faithfully reproduced Didot specimen (not the blown out scans you often find in textbooks) I&rsquo;m reminded that the notion &ldquo;Didot is not for text&rdquo; is just wrong.</p>

<p>Nina, prior to that thread, I was getting really pissed off with Hrant&rsquo;s ad hominem ways. He offered to give me some respite by not posting in threads I started, for which I am grateful.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>However, Nick, I have to suspect that you’d rather people not look at that other thread because of the opinions expressed there about your results.</em></p>
<p>No Hrant, I just liked the way it was free of you constantly expressing your suspicions about my thoughts and motivations.
Deal with what I say and mind your own damn business.
Or as you would put it with the un-manly insinuation, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re strong enough to potentially change your ways&rdquo;</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>Nick, you imply that De Vinne didn’t see what he says he sees&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Actually, I said he was in his 60s, the implication being that his eyesight wasn&rsquo;t as good as it used to be.</p>
<p><em>how can you say that De Vinne’s opinion, a man who was actually one of those doing the reviving, is to be dismissed as irrelevant?</em></p>
<p>De Vinne was biased and bolstering, to use the term you introduced.
He was extremely relevant, as a leader in the band of reformers who produced the great era of historicism in typography.</p>
<p>Bill, I suspect you are confusing the issue of contrast with the stylistic differences between the modern and the old style.
Enough already with the Bodoni trashing, the Scotch Modern style remedied a lot of the problems with the first moderns, by discriminately dealing with where to put the contrast (important, as you astutely observed). For more on the evolution from Modern to Scotch Roman and Scotch Modern, see page 5 of the <a href="http://shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf">Modern Suite pdf.</a></p>
<p>Why is there the association of moderns with high contrast? Aren&rsquo;t the Centuries (except COS!) moderns? Isn&rsquo;t Monotype Garamond high contrast?
This is where the bolstering came in: all the &ldquo;evils&rdquo; of high contrast were projected onto the modern style, to advance the historicist agenda.</p>

<p>An offer that applies to anybody*. Tellingly, you&rsquo;re the only person in 10+ years that has resorted to this sort of thing. Because I hang out at Design-oriented venues (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://typophile.com/node/16005">http://typophile.com/node/16005</a></li>

<p>But most of all: not making an exception for a thread where you dangle my name like a carrot is extremely weak. Not to mention that it puts an undue burden on this thread, and its followers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>free of you constantly expressing your suspicions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said: in Design, that comes with the territory. It would be useful -not least to you- if you could assimilate it instead of shunning it. I have to think that shunning criticism is too far into the realm of Art.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re strong enough to potentially change your ways”</p>
<p>It takes strength, Nick - this is not a stretch. But there was no masculine slant to that - don&rsquo;t distort things, especially not common expressions. For one thing, a woman can &ldquo;act like a man&rdquo; too (and vice versa) - sometimes it&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Please elaborate on what the problems were and why they existed.</p>
<p>BTW, that image is highly misleading in a number of ways.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an astute comment, I think. It also makes me think that we&rsquo;re all talking somewhat at cross purposes as a result of continued conflation of high contrast and ‘modern’ style types. Bill is talking about high contrast, and Nick and I are talking about styles of letters, within which contrast is modulated according to size. The idea that De Vinne and others dismiss an entire class of letterforms as being hard to read <em>despite the fact that they are read by large numbers of people</em>, seems to me foolish and contrary to basic observation. I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that a) Caslon is probably easier to read in most situations and b) is much more forgiving of less than optimal use. But to say that all the Romantic types and their derivatives hurt the eyes, really cause pain, are impossible to read at any length, strikes me as over-stating the case to an absurd degree. The 19th Century was the first age of something like mass literacy in England and America, and a huge amount of what was published and read was in types that fall broadly under De Vinne&rsquo;s condemnation. Was everyone wandering around with bloodshot eyes, having just read their daily ration of half a page of text?</p>
<hr>
<p>Bill: <em>I suspect that you are making the mistake of attending only to the thins. But this is only one part of the comparison, the other being how thick the thicks are. Contrast is the <em>ratio</em> of thick to thin. In “Old Style” the reduction in contrast is achieved not by increasing the thins of past types, but rather by reducing the thick stems—and changing the proportions in the process.</em></p>
<p>First off, let me say that I think what Nick has done with Eunoia ‘Text’ is to produce a version of his design that is easily legible at typical text <em>sizes,</em> which is not the same thing as a typeface that I would actually want to read any considerable amount of text in. It means he has a companion type for his display Euonia, which can be used to maintain the stylistic component of a design, which is a useful thing in an advertisement or similar setting in which some small amount of text might be involved in what is, overall, a display context. The debate seems to really be about different undertstandings of what is meant by ‘text’.</p>
<p>But I think you are wrong, Bill, about Nick attending only to the thins. If you look at what he did in Eunoia, you will see that he actually did the opposite: he reduced the weight of the verticals. This is in keeping with the Scotch Roman moderation of Romantic contrast, which also works by thinning the thicker strokes rather than increasing the weight of the hairlines.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that D. B. Updike and Theodore De Vinne had tastes and opinions that were personal to them. However, I would also note that D. B. Updike was one of the first printers in the U.S. to recognize the merits of Times Roman.</p>
<p>I think that Bodoni was beautiful, and that there were numerous readable Scotch Romans.</p>
<p>But I also know that a great deal of 19th Century typography was execrable, and a major factor in that was the prevalence of Scotch Roman fonts that were anemic and ugly. This isn&rsquo;t a matter of Updike&rsquo;s or De Vinne&rsquo;s failing eyesight - its because they weren&rsquo;t blind that they noticed this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they may not have gone a bit overboard. To refer to Baskerville as being &ldquo;mischievous in its consequences&rdquo; because it made it possible for Bodoni to think of going further with his font&hellip; bespeaks an attitude with which I, and most moderns, have little sympathy. Bodoni has its place, and individual typographers who misuse Scotch Roman are responsible for their own misdeeds.</p>
<p>First, they came to Baskerville, and told him that his new typeface wasn&rsquo;t allowed, and he would have to stick within the limits of what we call an Oldstyle typeface.</p>
<p>Then they came to Wagner and told him that he couldn&rsquo;t stretch his harmonies that much farther than Beethoven had, because then there would be no way to top it but to produce absurd music with no harmonic content whatever (i.e. Schoenberg).</p>
<p>When they come for Copernicus, in order to prevent Darwin - I mean, most people eat meat, so if you let that kind of notion get around, they&rsquo;ll see nothing wrong with herding humans like cattle in order to build some imagined utopia - no one will have the conceptual framework left with which to speak up.</p>
<p>So I think the real problem isn&rsquo;t a lack of typographical taste on the part of D. B. Updike, but that at one point he famously expressed himself in such a way as to at least suggest some of the less attractive manifestations of conservative politics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant: <em>You mean with familiarity being removed/equivalent, correct?</em></p>
<p>Yes, although let me take advantage of the moment to record my current thoughts on familiarity. Warning: rambling ahead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think familiarity is very important in the context of comparative readability of different typefaces within what I&rsquo;ll call, for want of a better term, a common writing form. Caslon Old Face (as it was marketed by the latterday Caslon foundry) and the Didot types and Scotch Roman are all typeface styles within a single writing form, and what they have in common is so much more fundamental to their identities than how they differ that I find it hard to believe that greater familiarity with one or the other is significant to readability. Familiarity, on the other hand, can play an obviously significant role when talking about different writing forms. If you are used to reading the Latin writing system only in its roman or italic forms and their close relatives, trying to read a page of text in Sütterlinschrift is going to be difficult. This is where familiarity &ndash; by which we mean practice &ndash; is obviously significant; so obviously so, that I don&rsquo;t think there is anything comparable in terms of familiarity with different typefaces and styles within the same writing form.</p>
<p>How much reading of a given type style &ndash; or, indeed, of a given writing form &ndash; constitutes familiarity? It seems to me that we are able to learn to recognise sets of signs and how they work as systems very rapidly; it is one of the things that humans are very good at. So again I doubt if familiarity is very significant, in that we can quickly become familiar with new things and, of course, familiarity with new things doesn&rsquo;t diminish familiarity with old things. This is one of the reasons why I think the dictum &lsquo;We read best what we read most&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work. It isn&rsquo;t as if familiarity with one type or writing form diminishes our familiarity with others, or as if we keep leapfrogging from one ‘best’ to another, improving all the time. I think we read things as well as they can be read. Familiarity only improves, with diminishing returns, how well we read something today compared to how well we read the same thing yesterday.</p>
<p>I do a lot of work with writing systems that I can&rsquo;t read. I can&rsquo;t read them because I don&rsquo;t know the languages that they are used to write, not because the sign sets are confusing or the systems beyond my comprehension. Which brings me to another point. Reading skill is fundamentally language skill. Yes, there is a perceptual process, but if we talk about readability only in terms of the visual appearance of text, we&rsquo;re forgetting what text is and what reading is. This is one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m increasingly dissatisfied with the dual speed/comprehension measure typically applied to reading. I don&rsquo;t think speed is important, unless one is reading a sign that tells you how to exit a burning building &ndash; and when was the last time you saw one of those that was well designed!</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that it is time to read ‘Poetry as “Menace” and “Atonement”’ again. This is an essay by Geoffrey Hill that I first read in my early 20s, and which I have read several times since. Each time I read it, I understand a bit more of it. I always read it slowly, not because the typeface is difficult or the page layout badly designed &ndash; they are not &ndash;, and I pause at the end of almost every paragraph, not because my eyes are sore from the type &ndash; they are not &ndash;, but because it is a rich text about rich ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what point I&rsquo;m trying to make now, except that there is something in the experience of reading that all the talk of readability, and all the ways in which that -ability might be measured, is missing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, that was well-expressed, and I agree almost entirely. Familiarity is a superficial thing; our minds are supremely flexible, so a variance that might seem pronounced to our trained eyes* does not result in a notable problem when reading. To me familiarity is restricted to two spheres: the obvious conscious familiarity with a system that enables its decipherment (what you mention)**; and an emotional component (which <em>can</em> affect performance, but minimally; people almost never stop reading something because they don&rsquo;t like the font). Most of all, familiarity can be factored out when actually making something; yes there&rsquo;s always the factor of style (nothing made by a human can avoid expression, and nothing made for a human should) but in the sphere of reading performance familiarity is indeed moot in the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is notable here that most laymen see no variance between let&rsquo;s say Times and Georgia, until they&rsquo;re asked, then they say things like &ldquo;This Times looks bigger than that Times.&rdquo; :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>** As Chris says (or at least hints) not being able to read something gives a certain special feeling too. BTW I&rsquo;ve concluded this is a big reason many non-Armenians enjoy the Armenian alphabet: it is familiar enough to feel comfortable, but has a compelling unfamiliarity as well.</p>
<p>And this actual, practical activity of making a font is where the admittedly limited relevance of readability in the overall becomes central; we cannot ignore it. Does a text face designer Know whether making the eye of his &ldquo;e&rdquo; will result in a more comfortable (or faster - in my mind something fully correlated) reading experience every time it shows up? Of course not. Should he worry that if his the eye of his &ldquo;e&rdquo; is too small once in a while somebody will have a problem? Of course. Now, is the stylistic effect of a small or large &ldquo;eye&rdquo; important? Of course. In Patria some of the glyphs (&ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;s&rdquo;) are overly large - so large that I believe that they slightly reduce readability! I did that for style. But knowing -or actually, believing- that certain things make reading potentially less/more comfortable is part and parcel to good design. Yes, much is missing when you discuss reading performance in a vacuum, but it&rsquo;s natural and useful for a designer to compartmentalize concepts to better understand and control them. This does/should not lead to ignoring the whole.</p>
<p>So reading is certainly not a mechanical process in toto; and it might not be sufficiently understood by anybody; but because readers have &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; components text type has &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; components too, and a good craftsman does not shy away from that challenge.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, there are certainly complex emotional aspects of type, which are much more than decoding. Also what John is writing about in trying to understand complex ideas in an essay seem to me about understanding language, not decoding type.</p>
<p>But at its most basic level, reading is decoding, and I think we can agree that that process can be made more uncomfortable by, eg, too small a size of type, or very shiny paper. In my view, high contrast type with vertical stress is a bit less comfortable to read in extended text, and a lot of other people have felt the same way.</p>
<p>Looking over the above, I&rsquo;d like to clarify what I am saying, and not, as there seems to be some misunderstanding. I&rsquo;d like to see where we are on common ground, and where we actually disagree.</p>
<p>Let me start with the question of whether M &amp; R Old Style is a &ldquo;high contrast&rdquo; type.</p>
<p>Here are Monotype&rsquo;s version of M&amp;R&rsquo;s Old Style, and of Scotch Roman, scanned from the Jaspert, Berry <em>Encyclopedia of Type Faces</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Old_Style_Mono_4190.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Scotch_Mono_5827.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how accurately Monotype Old Style matches the original, but the general look is the same. Jaspert says that the Monotype Scotch Roman is an accurate copy of the original M &amp; R type. (You can compare letters more easily if you slide the image to the right.)</p>
<p>When I measure these in Photoshop, the ratio of breadth of the stem of n to the depth of its vertical is 2 for Old Style, and 3 for Scotch.</p>
<p>Nick, can we agree that the Old Style is lower, not higher contrast than Scotch?</p>

<p>Hrant, I&rsquo;m afraid I have been misunderstood in this thread as saying that Old Styles are inherently superior, or that they <em>must</em> have lower contrast.</p>
<p>That is not what I said or believe. The relevance of this particular old style to my discussion here is that M&amp;R&rsquo;s Old Style was the first &lsquo;new&rsquo; old style revival to become to be widely used and copied&ndash;after its introduction in 1860. It is thus relevant to my conjecture that the revived usage of old styles for text had something to do with their greater reading comfort, as compared to the higher contrast, vertically stressed types that were around.</p>
<p>Caslon was first revived in 1844, and then several times later for novels with historical settings. But it was really the M&amp;R font that made the break through. Then other lower contrast types followed, both old style and scotch, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And these lower contrast types displaced, for use in extended text, the higher contrast, vertically stressed types that had dominated earlier.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I think the point is a greater readability explanation is not enough to account for the revived use of moderate contrast translation-based types over the high-contrast expansion-based types of the Romanticist era. The moderate contrast expansion-based types of the Neoclassical era that pre-date the high-contrast expansion-based types of the Romanticist era also had great readability.</p>
<p>Certainly there was a reaction to high-contrast expansion-based types of the Romanticist era, which probably had to do with issues surrounding the robustness of the word-forms high contrast produced, and the discomfort caused by perceptual side-effects. The resurgence of Caslon was part of that reaction, but only representative of one branch of the response.</p>
<p>My sense of Nick&rsquo;s intent is that he wants to contextualize the resurgence of the oldstyle more historically in this way and bring other historical forces into the picture. This paints a more complex picture of what happened.</p>

<p>This is over-simple - there are many points running around here.</p>
<p>And you are giving too much credit to partisans of readability relativism*; Nick&rsquo;s view is just as simplistic as that of somebody* saying the change was due only to readability, just in the other extreme. You might find it hard to believe that anybody no longer in the 90s can believe such things, but sadly it seems to be true. On top of that there&rsquo;s a lack of willpower in admitting it, resorting instead to rummaging for pretexts to escape self-incrimination, in effect only <em>pretending</em> to answer the most difficult questions, hoping that people won&rsquo;t care enough to keep pursuing them. This is much more damaging to progress than tainting a discussion with personal confrontation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re not one, so please don&rsquo;t appease them. People stop reading a few lines because the mood of the font doesn&rsquo;t match the text?! Somebody besides me say something, please! This is not some cocktail party where vacuous smil[i]es are in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Which would not be William.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m not trying to derail the historical discussion. I&rsquo;m simply focusing on things I enjoy and find valuable (like the future), and in the meantime trying to prevent historical revisionism via the use of readability relativism as a fog-generator.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, you want a more complete picture, and that&rsquo;s a fair enough criticism of my initial comments. But Nick wasn&rsquo;t advocating a mix of aesthetics and readability as a cause of the transition. In the following, with strong language, he seems to deny readability any role at all in the transition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[I would] simply ask those who diss the modern (and Scotch Modern) style for being inferior to the old style’s “superior” readability, and going on about dazzle and picket fences and other such nonsense: “How could anything with such readability issues become so popular and effective?” Didn’t anybody back then notice how uncomfortable they were reading it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to think about the complaint of Franklin&rsquo;s friend about Baskerville. I think it is interesting because the issue of dazzle already comes up. In that case I think that it may be a matter of the eye being tuned to one style, and Baskerville&rsquo;s type plus new printing sharpness seeming dazzling by comparison, because the eye-brain combo wasn&rsquo;t used to interpreting such contrast. But with use, the eye and brain are retrained, and that reaction to novelty faded.</p>
<p>But as the contrast became more extreme, I don&rsquo;t think the eye-brain combo can completely accommodate the high contrast Bodoni style and read with the same comfort in small, extended text.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the Baskerville style is more sensitive to scaling. When Adobe Caslon, which has a contrast more similar to Baskerville&ndash;not the original printed Caslon&ndash;is printed at smaller text sizes to me the horizontals get too anemic and do hurt readability. On the other hand, I have seen the use of Baskerville in an early 19th century Bible, fairly big, and there the letter press printing was fine as far as contrast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll directly address Nick&rsquo;s questions above, but I&rsquo;d like to hear first from him on whether he still thinks M&amp;R&rsquo;s Old Style is a high contrast than Scotch Roman.</p>

<p>That is correct Peter.
As I have often commented, I don&rsquo;t consider fonts, let alone typefaces, to have inherent readability, they are tools which typographers use to create documents which are more or less &ldquo;reader-friendly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With this understanding, the idea that one type genre replaced another because it was more readable doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
Further, old-styles didn&rsquo;t replace moderns, they augmented them as the typographer&rsquo;s palette expanded.</p>
<p><em>Nick, can we agree that the Old Style is lower, not higher contrast than Scotch?</em></p>
<p>Bill, your source material is printed 100 years after the era, with reproduction types which appear to be quite large for basic text&ndash;not the kind of evidence that I would consider accurate.</p>
<p>Also, you are showing types of two different weights.  If it is even possible to come up with a definition of contrast that can be used to measure the comparative contrast of different genres, surely the starting point of a comparison should be with faces that have the same stem thickness?</p>

<p>Not more historically, <em>only</em> historically (or rather culturally).
Peter, your sense was close, but still critically off.</p>
<p>Now, if you think Nick is wrong, you have a responsibility of saying so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the idea that one type genre replaced another because

<p>There&rsquo;s a critical word missing there: &ldquo;only&rdquo;, between &ldquo;another&rdquo; and &ldquo;because&rdquo;. William doesn&rsquo;t seem to believe that, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t. But you believe much more than the opposite of what we mean; and you have just (and previously, although not clearly in this thread) revealed this - thank you.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is spin.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Hmmm, why can a size be too large for text? Exactly?
(This is an important question; I will pursue it.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>surely the starting point of a comparison should
be with faces that have the same stem thickness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not if a category of type is inherently light/dark. And in any case normalizing stem thickness is of course completely insufficient; it makes comparison worse not better.</p>

<p>Hrant, I think you are almost always too quick to jump to and publicly state your <em>guesses</em> about the motivations of other people, which &ndash; in case you have not noticed &ndash; usually results in them getting pissed off. I understand that you feel in some sense compelled to this &ndash; ‘I’m not good at allowing people to get away with what I consider misinformation’ &ndash;, but it never actually seems a useful manoeuvre, does it? All that happens is that the discussion either abandons all relevance to the topic and becomes a debate about your behaviour, or simply ends.</p>
<p>So in the interest of the discussion &ndash; in the interest of Typophile remaining, as you put it, something that truly helps people &ndash;, I think you should apply the principle of charity, to people&rsquo;s motivations if not to their ideas. At the very least, you might recognise that very often people are feeling their way toward understanding, not only of each other&rsquo;s ideas but also of their own. [My long post last night was a signal case of such feeling process, gradually coming up with the words to put my thoughts in order.]</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like to have their motives questioned, especially not when they are giving their time and mental effort to a discussion among colleagues. By all means disagree with the ideas expressed, but I think you &ndash; and we all &ndash; will get more traction if we don&rsquo;t derail discussion by accusing others of bad faith. Sometimes, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, we sense something of value in our still imperfectly expressed ideas even as they are being legitimately challenged. That&rsquo;s how discussion often proceeds: slowly and with all the teeth being pulled one by one, not all at once. It requires patience and charity. And I say that as someone who has often lacked both.</p>

<p>You are showing types of two different weights &hellip;surely the starting point of a comparison should be with faces that have the same stem thickness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick, the question we are discussing is contrast at text size. Normalizing for stem thickness would be misleading, because in traditional type taking stem thickness as a norm might mean comparing a Caslon intended for 24 point with a Bodoni intended for 12 point. So we wouldn&rsquo;t be addressing the issue of contrast at text sizes; so contrast at text sizes is what is appropriate.</p>
<p>The samples are not different weights; they are both regular weight, not bold or thin. The sample in Jaspert of Old Style seems to be 12 point. The sample of Scotch Roman in Jaspert seems to be 18 point, so the comparison in my scan is flawed, but is the best I had available. If I compare your Scotch Modern, for example, I get a contrast of 3.4 on the &lsquo;n&rsquo;, actually a larger contrast than the Monotype would indicate for the original Scotch of Miller. But I guess that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in your &ldquo;Scotch Modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I said, one key difference as far as contrast between old style and modern is that the stems are lighter at text sizes.</p>

<p>David, thanks for the question. I don&rsquo;t know how to check &lsquo;luminace ratios&rsquo; on my computer screen. Does this have to do with what is suitable for television, or computer screen or both?</p>
<p>Thanks, Lucas!</p>
<p>John, by &lsquo;basic&rsquo; I just meant that we have to get the marks on paper into meaningful words before we have any deeper understanding of what is being said. I think we agree on this.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;home made&rdquo;  way to test/check luminance ratio is to set a color background &ndash; let&rsquo;s say  R=0 G=128 B=192.  As you know,  luminance is a function of tint (addition of white) and shade (addition of black).  This can be checked in normal illumination conditions, and compared to darkened conditions (e.g. a darkened theater environment).</p>
<p>Although this is not an accurate test &ndash; unlike using the specific font with the specific device &ndash; it could give you the &lsquo;feeling for the font behavior&rsquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am certainly wondering what is going on here. Apparently, in a long-running feud between two individuals, both sides have on occasion gone a bit too far - and yet both individuals seem like generally reasonable and civilized people, and so it seems bizarre that it could ever have gotten to this point.</p>
<p>I have my own opinion about the issue being debated. I feel both sides to the issue have some merit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I know there are plenty of low-contrast and readable Scotch Roman typefaces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know that 19th Century typography featured a lot of ugly Scotch Roman typefaces which were unpleasant to read. They weren&rsquo;t necessarily high contrast in the Bodoni or Didot sense, but they were drab and anemic. These typefaces were often the only ones available to some printers, apparently, because they were even used for materials for which something like Morris' Golden type would have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>Garamond and Baskerville were <em>vastly</em> superior to those typefaces, while Alexander Phemister&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; font was, at best, only a slight improvement, retaining many of the flaws of the worst of the Scotch Romans, in my opinion. And, yes, this means that a good Scotch Roman would have been superior to Phemister&rsquo;s Old Style type, but while the good Scotch Romans existed at the time, they were hardly being used.</p>
<p>My perception of the situation is that constraints on the expense of printing, plus a limited choice of typefaces, due to the revivals being in the future, meant that printers couldn&rsquo;t choose typefaces we would consider attractive, such as Garamond or Baskerville.</p>
<p>Instead, a printer in those days basically had four choices.</p>
<p>One of the Scotch Romans that I find characteristic of the hideous typography of the period.</p>
<p>An &ldquo;old style&rdquo; based on the one drawn by Alexander Phemister, which would be, in my opinion, a small improvement.</p>
<p>A well-proportioned Scotch Roman with a slightly heavier weight. This, however, would increase the paper required for the same text; it might not be available in a large enough point size; and since it is also a Scotch Roman, it may have been hard to recognize it would have made a worthwhile difference.</p>
<p>A version of Caslon that would have seemed dated, and hence distracting, to readers then.</p>
<p>So, again in my opinion, the problem wasn&rsquo;t a universal epidemic of bad taste. Rather, a demand for inexpensively printed books, coupled with the savings from mass production, meant that even though many printers, not just a few voices in the wilderness like William Morris, Lawrence De Vinne, and Daniel Berkeley Updike, could see something was wrong&hellip; but the feedback in the marketplace that led to improved typefaces was agonizingly slow by our standards.</p>
<p>First ATF, and then Monotype, engaged in a series of type revivals that led to the styles of type becoming available that are considered the standards of today. Even legibility faces like Corona, dull workhorses that they might be, ended up light-years ahead of the typical Victorian Scotch Roman as a result.</p>
<p>The sudden bursting of creativity wasn&rsquo;t the result of a sudden change in taste, but the result of an improvement in the economic conditions of production that made it possible for a long-felt need to be answered. People in 1850 weren&rsquo;t satisfied with the typical cheaply-printed book, but paying ten times the price wasn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

<p>John (quadribloc), are you refering to Century and Century Expanded, which you said you really like?</p>
<p>Century was, according to Jaspert &ldquo;Cut in 1894 by Linn Boyd Benton in collaboration with T.L. De Vinne for the <em>Century Magazine</em> to supply <em>a blacker and more readable face than the thin type used previously</em>, and slightly condensed to fit the double-column setting of the magazine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words we have at work here none other than the very T.L. De Vinne whose views Nick, above, dismissed as deluded by his bias against advertising and his &ldquo;historicism&rdquo;. But here he works with Benton on modifying a Scotch, not an old style, to have, it seems, fatter thins at text sizes, for the purpose of increased readability&ndash;as the passage I starred indicates.</p>
<p>I think this shows that Nick&rsquo;s negative assumptions about De Vinne&rsquo;s motives are not well founded. He was perfectly capable of distinguishing between issues of contrast and other old style characteristics, and evidently believed that lower contrast, or at least fatter thins, helps readability.</p>
<p>Nick, what evidence is there that De Vinne was prejudiced against printing done for advertising, as opposed to bad layout and printing, plain and simple?</p>

Century doesn&rsquo;t have most of the faults of a typical Scotch Roman of that period, although it does have the main characteristics of the bad ones: it is much too condensed for normal reading.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there wasn&rsquo;t really anything wrong with the aesthetic of the period, which preferred modern typefaces over oldstyle because of a disdain for superfluous ornament. But there was plenty wrong with the printing conditions, which led to overly condensed and overly light faces - and Scotch Romans survived this abuse less well than some other styles of type would have.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a terminological question, trying to come up with a means of describing the styles of type that I&rsquo;ve been talking of independently of the notion of ‘high contrast’, which is really a matter of implementation of those styles. Peter has helpfully reminded us that these are letters based on expansion, following Noordzij&rsquo;s classification of stroke models. I&rsquo;m going to suggest the term ‘dynamic contrast types’ to describe the resulting styles. Letters based on translation have a fixed contrast relative to tool size, and letters based on rotation have variable contrast relative to angle. But letters based on expansion have dynamic contrast derived from pressure, largely independent of size or angle, i.e. the same movement of the pen can produce lines of very different weight.</p>
<p>I think this notion of dynamic contrast helps clarify what we are talking about in these styles of type, and how their style relates to the implementation of high contrast in some designs/sizes.</p>
<p>Bill, thanks for the comments re. De Vinne&rsquo;s involvement in the design of Century, which for me squares the circle of this discussion. While you cite this history to counter Nick&rsquo;s questioning of De Vinne&rsquo;s motives in denigrating certain styles of type, the same history also demonstrates the point that Nick, and I, have been making: that extreme or unfortunate contrast is not a necessary feature of these styles of type, and that moderating that contrast, using the natural dynamics of those styles, does not fundamentally alter the style.</p>
<p>I suppose now the question is whether Caslon is significantly more readable than Century? :)</p>
<hr>
<p>[In more general terms, Peter, what do you think of this move from Noordzijan stroke description to typeface classification based on resulting contrast? I find the Noordzij terminology very comfortable for describing stroke construction, but less so for classifying the results as applied in typefaces. So I end up using phrases like ‘a typeface based on a translation stroke model’, because ‘translation typeface’ doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good usage.]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are so many different kinds of Caslon.</p>
<p>The Caslon used for printing the Diary of Lady Willoughby in 1844, as (its title page was) pictured in Anatomy of a Typeface, has proportions that remind me very much of those of Caledonia and several other faces of W. A. Dwiggins - or those of Monticello, but not of Oxford, of which Monticello is said to have been a revival. It appears to be a beautiful face of excellent readability (as were the others mentioned in this paragraph, for that matter).</p>
<p>There is Caslon 540, the one with the stubby descenders. A good type for advertising display copy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the serifs make the font, but in my previous post, I didn&rsquo;t note that some Scotch Romans, although they weren&rsquo;t overly condensed, were also unattractive in appearance - but this is also true of some Caslons. In the case of the Scotch Romans, they looked too dry, to dull, too severe. But not because they looked like Bodoni or Didot, because whatever the flaws of those faces are, those weren&rsquo;t them. Some of this may just be taste because of what I&rsquo;m used to, but I suspect that is not the only cause.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even find a typeface in current use that has the faults of those Scotch Romans. There are display fonts even less suited for body text - like Modern No. 20 - but, by and large, nothing has survived which is like them. Monotype Modern No. 7 - found in many a college math and science textbook from the 1950s and earlier - has only the faintest whisper of the faults of what I consider to be the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; Scotch Romans so typical of the period.</p>
<p>And the pages from &ldquo;Typo&rdquo;, at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-corpus-typo.html">http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-corpus-typo.html</a></p>
<p>are set in a font which is a bit too light and too severe, but still one of the better ones from that period - still entirely acceptable for reading, but problematic enough to create some desire for something better.</p>

<p>John, looking back over this long thread, Nick says that issues of the &lsquo;picket fence&rsquo; and dazzle are &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;, that they are only a problem of the 20th century, and that Scotch design fixed all the problems with Bodoni. That all seems to me contradictory, so I don&rsquo;t know what his position is. Also he seems to deny that reducing contrast for small size has anything to do with readability, which to me just isn&rsquo;t credible.</p>
<p>What I take to be your view is that dazzle does indeed exist, and can happen if a Didone is not executed appropriately for size or not handled carefully&ndash;and it was originally done appropriately. So while there are potential problems with the style, they can be overcome completely.</p>
<p>I think the bit that I don&rsquo;t agree with you about is the &ldquo;completely&rdquo; part. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve communicated here well the &lsquo;reading comfort&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>I drive a Ford Crown Vic, the car that taxi cabs and police use. It&rsquo;s terribly unfashionable, but quite comfortable for long trips, such as we often take to New York City to see our children. I think it&rsquo;s very comfortable, but then I got into my friend&rsquo;s Lexus. Aaaah, now that&rsquo;s comfortable. It isn&rsquo;t radically more comfortable, just a bit, but enough that some people&ndash;not me&ndash;are willing to pay double.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was after in Williams Caslon Text. Let me call it the &ldquo;lexus effect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve told you, you started me on this journey. Many years ago, there were several threads discussing Caslon, and in one I started you and Hrant and Kent participated, and at one point you wrote: &ldquo;Sadly, Adobe Caslon is the only version that is suited to a wide range of typographic application, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like Caslon, so what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a little bell went off in my head, and I remembered, &ldquo;Wait a minute, there&rsquo;s that nice Caslon that Einstein&rsquo;s Autobiography is in. Maybe I could capture that feeling.&rdquo; So I went and bought Fontlab and the eventual result you see.</p>
<p>What I remembered [nearly 40 years later!] was that feeling: this is somehow a different and more comfortable read. The Lexus Effect. I remembered that I was at the same time also disturbed by what I felt is a &ldquo;junky&rdquo; or &ldquo;sloppy&rdquo; look. Indeed, now I know one of the problems is that Merganthaler Linotype, following the original, puts the top of the vwxy at the &ldquo;overshoot height.&rdquo; This makes the text look &ldquo;off&rdquo; in a subtle way. Some people might prefer that look, but I don&rsquo;t. And there is a lot of hopping around of the base line due to old linotype mats, probably. And there are lots of other issues. But still the magic is there.</p>
<p>So my thoughts have been directed to what got that effect I remembered. And the effect is what I have been after, and not authenticity, because some aspects of Caslon I didn&rsquo;t like. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;William Caslon&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Williams.&rdquo; Another William was remixing the brew.</p>
<p>Now <em>one</em> of the things I noticed is that the way contrast is handled is different from Adobe Caslon. But also the m and n handle it differently in the original Caslon. So I made my choice, created my own variation that I liked better, and went with that. And it seemed to help get the magic. But that was only <em>one</em> of maybe ten issues I dealt with. Another is proportion, which as John S. (quadribloc) mentions also influences reading comfort.</p>
<p>Now Nick and you it seems don&rsquo;t want to believe that comfort is a factor at all, I take it. Unless something is really off &ldquo;readerability&rdquo; zeros out all problems. Well, I disagree about the &ldquo;zeros&rdquo; bit, and, I&rsquo;ve been trying to build a Lexus. When it comes out, or if you have access to Boston Magazine now, people can look at it in print, everyone can make up his or her own mind.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll just clarify one thing about my position that I thought I had been stating.</p>
<p>The Scotch Romans that I disliked most intensely did not have &ldquo;dazzle&rdquo; as their chief problem. They had less dazzle even than, say, Bodoni Book - but they were still dry and stiff. Throw in overly condensed, as was often true in that period, and one has a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Even the better Scotch Romans usually did have problems, but I would prefer not to say that the problems of Scotch Roman can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;zeroed&rdquo;, because that gets into the territory of advocating that there is just one ideal type style.</p>
<p>I like Times Roman. However, to me, it isn&rsquo;t completely invisible - it has a faint hint of an unmistakably &ldquo;British&rdquo; flavor, like Perpetua or Gill Sans.</p>
<p>I like Baskerville - but the italics, especially, are a bit too eccentric in form to make it an all-purpose type.</p>
<p>I like Garamond - but it is, in some aspects, visibly archaic.</p>
<p>Thus, while I think that Century Expanded is further from perfect than any of those three typefaces, I think that frequent exposure has meant that it, too, has contributed something to my generation&rsquo;s expectation of what the printed page should look like - and so, if someone were to try and design a truly &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; type, one which draws no attention to itself as it presents the words set in it (and, here, usage is very important; a type that is too plain where a decorative type is expected also calls attention to itself) would admit of some influence from Century Expanded and the like in addition to, say, Garamond, Baskerville, Bell and Caslon.</p>

I think the picket fence and dazzle effects in poorly done types or typography is primarily a problem with comfort. [There is another potential problem which is a legibility problem when hairlines actually drop out, but the more common problem is one of comfort.] Where I disagreed with you in this discussion is in the idea that there is something inherently problematic with the dynamic contrast types in this regard. I didn&rsquo;t even disagree with you that Caslon is more readable, at least in more situations. What I don&rsquo;t want is for your very nice Caslon to be rolled out with, yet again, the old canard that there is something inherently unreadable about dynamic contrast types. By all means point to problems with specific typefaces in specific situations, but please allow for the facts a) that people in very large numbers &ndash; during the first period of relatively mass literacy &ndash; read an awful lot of stuff in these types; b) that those types &ndash; indeed, even those very books &ndash; are still readable (I know this, because I&rsquo;ve actually read some of them, due to an interest in 19th Century English Catholic literature, much of it not reprinted in later editions); and c) that within the related styles characterised by the expansion stroke model there is a lot of room for new typeface design, some of it very readable indeed (witness Kepler, to my mind Robert Slimbach&rsquo;s best type design; or my own Brill types).</p>

<p><em>I don’t think any font can or should be totally invisible.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with that, and what is &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; for one reader will be visible for another reader, since each person comes to the printed page with different expectations.</p>
<p>For one reader, a page set in Weiss Roman or Univers or Optima or Stone Sans might pass completely unremarked, and for another, the choice of font might seem startling or bizarre.</p>
<p>There are, though, many cases where the choice of font is not particularly important, and where the decision to just use, say, Times Roman, as the &ldquo;default&rdquo; serif font, is entirely defensible. Where the typography is to be highly readable, but not to call attention to itself as art&hellip; or in any other way. But the trouble with trying to design a typeface that is <em>more</em> unnoticed than Times, or Caledonia, or Century Expanded, though, would be that invisibility is, as I noted above, subjective. One can at best design a typeface invisible to readers from one particular country and one particular generation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I didn&rsquo;t claim that what you are now calling dynamic contrast types are inherently problematic, if you mean by that that they must have problems with reading comfort. I said that extremes of contrast in a vertically stressed design do decrease reading comfort for a text face. That decrease can be very mild or very severe, depending on the excess. I think that old style stress is less vulnerable to dazzle, because of where the thicks and thins fall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the old canard that there is something inherently unreadable about dynamic contrast types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I was trying to make clear with my Crown Vic/Lexus comparison is that I don&rsquo;t think reading comfort is dichotomy readable/unreadable. It is a gradual curve. Vertical stress with high contrast to me is less comfortable to read. You can decrease this as a problem if you increase contrast, and probably eliminate it altogether. You might have other problems with a design, as there are many interacting variables, but that is another thing.</p>
<p>I am saying that there is a gradual curve, where you something can be quite uncomfortable, or only mildly, or not at all. Furthermore, often reading comfort is not the top priority, particularly in a display face.</p>
<p>That being said, I have the feeling that I would find somewhat uncomfortable fonts that you might find quite fine. You can understand it if you listen to Hayden and Beethoven :)</p>
<p>Beethoven, for all his brilliance is more disturbed, troubled. If that&rsquo;s what you want, that&rsquo;s great. And Beethoven is great, but he&rsquo;s the show. In a text face, the writer&rsquo;s meaning is the show, I agree with Stanley Morrison that you generally want something quieter, something that doesn&rsquo;t attract attention to itself. I like to think that it&rsquo;s like a beautiful voice of a story teller, where you don&rsquo;t attend to the beauty of the voice, but it enhances the story being told.</p>
<p>The fact that I am first a writer really colors my approach to type. I want the typeface to be totally devoted to getting across my words in an inviting and credible way. I absolutely don&rsquo;t want the text type itself to show off and compete with me as a writer. I want the type to show me off. Design of text type is a great art, but servant art.</p>

<p>Noordzijan stroke description references sorts of contrast. Are you asking about about classification by degree? Noordzij models intensification and attenuation of contrast to get a handle of modulation of degrees, or of the severity of the contrast. Are you looking for a description that is maybe more phenotypical, or descriptive of form in abstract featural terms, than genotypical?</p>

<p>Not directly. It references how strokes are made and, hence, what kind of contrasts may result. What I am suggesting is that, when talking about things at the type style level, rather than at the stroke level, it may make more sense to reference sorts of contrast directly.</p>

But my point in the comparison&ndash;from a slide of my Typecon talk&ndash;is not to compare two text faces, but simply to demonstrate the existence of the picket effect, and its effect on reading comfort&ndash;which Nick, at one point here declared &ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo; So I wanted the comparison to be extreme, to establish clearly the reality of the effect.</p>
<p>The effect is, as you can see for yourself, is quite real, which is the point of my illustration.</p>
<p>Can we at least agree that the effect exists?</p>
<p>My working hypothesis in developing Williams Caslon was that a residual effect like this is happening with many text faces, and could be counteracted to increase reading comfort, even if the increase is small&ndash;the Lexus effect, as I called it above. So I did quite a few things&ndash;and not only reducing contrast&ndash;to counteract it.</p>
<p>If you want to compare Williams Caslon Text to other faces for extended text&ndash;and I hope people will when it comes out&ndash;the fair way will be to compare printed samples, at size.</p>

I am not saying the effect does not exist by any means. I was just showing different amounts of it as best I could on a web post (not having Williams Caslon). I am saying the effect exists to different degrees and is not limited to didone faces. I am also saying contrast is not the only factor and even there, not enough is also an issue. I just think picking one culprit to dismiss is not the whole story and that type design is a task that requires juggling all the variables as they interact which makes it hard to nicely isolate variables in the name of proper and rigorous science. I also had noticed the big jump in frustration level when my son was taking multiple variable calculus&ndash;it is just harder to do but still a requirement :-)</p>

<p>Chris, I completely agree. I have said repeatedly that there were probably ten different issues I dealt with in trying to make a comfortable face. I mentioned contrast as one, as that is one that many type designers would recognize as at least a potential problem.</p>

<p>Yes, thank you. the sample is 1:1?</p>
<p>Hrant,</p>
<p>Designing and programming touchscreens (and small screens, huge screens).   I don&rsquo;t know how much to dive in to the subject, but here&rsquo;s a brief &amp; compact description.</p>
<p>Here are several screen shoots (see it as &lsquo;study&rsquo;). You have the graphic &ndash; images, buttons,  text  (although I changed on purpose to some overused font).
Text could be one letter, word, several sentences (btw, the white rectangle with the number is just part of the programming).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to go into the known debate about serif vs. sans as far as legibility  but if the font is well crafted it could serve you well. As I said, on purpose I changed the font before posting the images; I don&rsquo;t think in terms of overused etc etc, but in terms of &lsquo;what&rsquo;s good/what isn&rsquo;t good to my specific device&rsquo;  and based on that pilot font I&rsquo;ll design something new, or  I&rsquo;ll look for well crafted fonts.</p>
<p>Bare in mind that there&rsquo;s a huge difference  when you see &ndash; what I call a &lsquo;static&rsquo; image, text, as posted here, and &lsquo;non-static&rsquo; &ndash; when you view the whole thing in real time. So, you need to take into consideration who is going to use the device, when (e.g. day time, night time), how far you are from the device.. etc..etc. Also another important factor is the size of the TS; for example, working on 800 by 600 pixels isn&rsquo;t like 400 by 300 pixels.</p>
<p>But of course  over time, like anything else in life, even if you see an image, text or font in that &lsquo;static&rsquo; situation, you can tell if it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>

<p>I have seen a small pdf of William&rsquo;s Caslon, and I think it&rsquo;s the best revival, in any medium, of a Caslon, ever. I also think it&rsquo;s one of the very best revivals of an older typeface, ever, done with such skill, such panache, and most important of all love, and patience. And humility.

<p>With all my heart, and all my head, I congratulate William on producing a <em>magical</em> typeface which is destined to give a lot of pleasure for many, many decades.</p>

There was the statement here that a high contrast old-style would still be more readable than a modern font, because the curves are different, creating less of a fence effect.</p>
<p>So I wonder: Is there any contemporary reinterpretation based on old style typeface with a high contrast? Google couldn&rsquo;t help me. I would appreciate an example.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Galliard is indeed a high contrast typeface, yet I believe that its contrast actually hinders readability (at least when it&rsquo;s printed using high resolution laser), and the same goes for TNR. I often thought that it would be nice to have a lower contrast version of Galliard, until a closer examination revealed that much of its charm and beauty relies on its particular contrast.</p>
<p>As for contrast and readability in general, I do believe that it is a balancing act, and that too much contrast (keeping <em>current</em> printing technologies in mind) will reduce the readability of extended texts.</p>

<p>Mr. Berkson has achieved something significant with his Williams Caslon.  I&rsquo;m gratified not only by Berkson&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibility, as it&rsquo;s evidenced by his Caslon, but by the reasonable, balanced approach behind it &ndash; his philosophical methodology, if you will. Reading the explanation as to why he undertook to create his Caslon, I saw all the hallmarks of a philosophically trained mind.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William, you know I see merit in your Caslon, and I did enjoy part one of your exposé, but I just read part two, and although most of it was fine I have to say that the readability theory section is highly unsatisfying. This, even though I agree with much of your direction and many of your conclusions. My own article back in issue 13 of Typo magazine has been described as suffering from &ldquo;wooly&rdquo; logic; well, what you&rsquo;ve got there is a wooly mammoth! :-/</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s great to see a type designer explaining himself in such detail.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, what I wrote about readability is not scientifically tested. Because reading science has been so slow to get to important issues of readability, I think we just have to plow ahead with whatever works for our eyes (or eye-brain combo). So what I wrote is a record of my effort to get a highly readable typeface. It doesn&rsquo;t claim to any authority; it&rsquo;s just my best effort at the time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Josh,above Boston Magazine used Hoefler&rsquo;s Knockout with Williams Caslon Text. Font Bureau recommends Titling Gothic and Bureau Grot, which I&rsquo;m sure would work well also. I&rsquo;m also partial to Kris Sowersby&rsquo;s National, which I suspect would go very well.</div>
