  looking for the original font of this logo.\r\nAt first sight to me it looks like
  a very badly treated Trajan - if you look at the detail you see that it even may
  be a \"live-traced\" version of the logo.\r\n\r\nCan you help me out?\r\nI tried
  recreating it with Trajan, but trajan seems to wide... (or too short) also, the
  serifs are different from (what is left of) the original serifs.\r\n\r\nThanks a
  lot! It got me puzzling...\r\n\r\n\r\n"
