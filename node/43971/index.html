<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_3793.JPG]</p>
<p>&hellip;from the Fonts section of the main Safari page on Apple.com - <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">http://www.apple.com/safari/</a></p>
<p>One of the biggest concerns around the Web fonts scheme is that Web designers would post commercial fonts through either ignorance or disregard of font licensing rights.  Apple were aware of this (both Safari folks and Font folks) so I find it hard to understand why they’re telling web designers that they can post any font to the Web.</p>
<p>This is probably a break-down in communication between marketing folks and the font/browser folks, but the damage has been done – Mac World appears to have parroted the misinformation in their recent Safari review&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/132708/2008/03/safari31.html">http://www.macworld.com/article/132708/2008/03/safari31.html</a></p>
<p>Hopefully Apple will fix this quickly, and post material that directs web designers to freeware fonts that can be used with the scheme.</p>
<p>Cheers, Si</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It isn’t Apple’s job to educate designers about font licensing. It would certainly be good of them to point it out, but nobody should expect them to do it. If the foundries aren’t licensing their fonts for web embedding, it’s their responsibility to be very upfront about it. This has been coming for years, foundries really should have started doing more than just tucking a “no embedding” provision into EULAs, which most people never bother to read. Put the terms up there in big red letters that people will actually see before they click “buy.”</div>

<p>I pinged Apple on Saturday and followed up this morning as well. Maybe I&rsquo;m an optimist, but I&rsquo;d expect the text will be changed some time this week. As I said on Friday in our panel discussion on Web fonts, this is the sort of thing that can easily happen at any big company when the PR/marketing folks go off and write something without quite enough careful vetting by the technical folks.

<p>Sorry, but I disagree. There are various options re. developer education around technologies that redistribute fonts. I believe that it absolutely is the responsibility of people who make font-exploiting technology to help developers and users stay legal. Here&rsquo;s a recent example from Microsoft - <a href="http://windowsclient.net/wpf/starter-kits/sce/sce-howto-using-fonts.aspx">http://windowsclient.net/wpf/starter-kits/sce/sce-howto-using-fonts.aspx</a></p>
<p>I can understand why a Apple might want to stay silent, and that might have been the safest thing for them to do legally. But in this case they are giving plain bad advice to web page designers, and that needs to be fixed.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re working on that.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a good test to see how seriously they take this problem. The ad in question was fixed within 24hrs, correct? And that involved editing a multipart Flash animation. This should be a quick fix. Clock is ticking.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;marketing&rsquo;. Marketing usually has little to nothing to do with the product&rsquo;s inherit abilities or lack thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that it absolutely is the responsibility of people who make font-exploiting technology to help developers and users stay legal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IANAL, but I think this would be really bad precedence. Just because you CAN copy a book on a photocopier, should the photocopier manufacturer be liable for you infringing copyright?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be NICE if apple&rsquo;s marketing folks ran this kind of stuff through their developers and added important details like we&rsquo;re discussing here, but I can&rsquo;t say Apple HAS to do that on any legal grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this case they are giving plain bad advice to web page designers&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eh&hellip;any competent web designer isn&rsquo;t going to believe anything on a marketing web site anyways. Mom the scrapbooker might believe it, though. So, yea, some concern there.</p>

<p>The text on Apple&rsquo;s web site (aside from the support section) is, in all likelihood, owned by marketing.</p>
<p>Saying you can upload any font for use with safari is true, just greatly overstating the feature both technically and legally. But that&rsquo;s what marketing does. The fine print/asterisks/caveats/gotchas are reserved for the back pages of the documentation or the knowledge-base articles, or some blog post somewhere in the future&hellip;</p>

<p>Not the hardware, but some scanning software and Photoshop will not scan US money properly. Most color laser printers sold in the states tag every document with unnoticeable serial numbers. But doing so with fonts means bringing back font DRM, which some important entities are openly against.</p>
<p>The purpose of my comment was not to elevate Apple’s actions above criticism. I just wanted to point out that this will not be the first time this happens, that the type industry should expect these incidents to happen, and foundries need to start being proactive and creative about licensing and educating users before it becomes a problem—i.e. before Firefox or IE jump on board. Some people are already doing so—creative license models, Adobe working with the AIGA on student fonts, Microsoft’s event hosting and of course, all the industry types talking about it here and elsewhere. But if you guys slip, you could end up in a nasty hole like the record industry, and that’s not something anyone in the industry really wants, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. Kutilek hits the nail on the head:</p>
<p>While fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copyrightable in most countries (although Typophiles wish they were), images or pictures (&ldquo;pictorial works&rdquo; as per US Copyright Law) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copyrightable in most countries, but many Typophiles do not hesitate to upload copyrighted pictures to Typophile threads without having obtained the permission to do so from the picture copyright owners. The Typophile website threads abound with pictures, for which the publication rights have not been acquired.</p>
<p>Look, for instance, at the start of this thread: Even this tiny picture (screen shot) inserted by Mr. Daniels probably is copyrightable, although this might be disputed at court, but by browsing through other Typophile threads you certainly will find many copyrighted pictures, for which the uploaders never acquired the picture publication rights.</p>
<p>If you download the pictures made by others, &ldquo;as they&rsquo;re are needed&rdquo;, and upload them without permission to your website, why do you complain that Apple Inc. intends to do the same with your fonts by downloading them without permission, &ldquo;as they&rsquo;re needed&rdquo; by Safari?</p>

<p>I agree with Chris (Apple lawyers please don’t come after me) ;-) there’s a difference between the hi-res © photograph and a 60px x 60px picture of a Seahawk helmet (at least I hope so). In the case of the Safari scheme we’re talking complete, unobfuscated, unsubsetted source fonts. However, it’s been my experience that drawing analogies between fonts and other forms of IP, be that pictures, music, books, etc., almost always break down.</p>

<p>Ah.. But that all depends on the person, his abilities and the useage. I know ways to take 72dpi images from the net, tweek and rez up them in photoshop and use them on the side of Buses.</p>
<p>But again as was stated before by Aluminum about Uli&rsquo;s point is that it&rsquo;s more about fair use and/or common sense.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem lies in how easy it is to pass a font from place to place with out retribution. Where a copyrighted image when the same is done.. the creator pushes much harder to bring retribution for it&rsquo;s mis-use.</p>

<p>You’re missing the point, it’s not &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; to post &ldquo;a font&rdquo; to a web site – the point of this thread is that Apple’s promotional material suggests that Web designers can post “any font”, when the reality is that no known commercial fonts can be used under the scheme. If Adobe’s material said the same thing about Flash embedding it would be wrong, just not as wrong as Apple’s statement as many commercial font licenses allow for Flash embedding.</p>

<p>And you will not be able to do this with regard to France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc., because your story of &ldquo;copyrightable fonts&rdquo; is a fairy tale. Only little children think that fairy tales become true by telling them over and over again.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Certainly the USA does&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who you as an American are claiming that this is so, should at least be able to specify the section of the American Copyright Law ruling that fonts are copyrightable and/or to specify the American Supreme Court decision ruling that fonts are copyrightable.

<p>PS: The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of &ldquo;new and original&rdquo; fonts may be registered in certain countries, e.g in Germany, on the basis of a design law (&ldquo;GeschmMG&rdquo; in Germany), but this has nothing to do with copyright laws.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Something which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an issue in the discussion so far is safety.</p>
<p>It is possible to build fonts which crash rasterisers. I can think of a couple opportunities in a .ttf or .otf which can cause serious problems in the app and the OS. Fonts are part of a text engine, usually integrated deeply into the OS. Fonts are subject to ambiguous standards and can contain many values which catch the rasteriser unaware. Integrity tests for fonts usually catch some of the problems, but never all of them. (Aside, it seems the PostScript Type 1 format is great for non-downloadable fonts). So far, bad fonts were always dealt with by the person who installed them. Even when something goes wrong, the user will usually know what happened and how to solve it.</p>
<p>In the context of a website there is no sanity check on the server end, it is up to the browser to make sure the font is fit. The user will be unaware of any potential problems in a webpage which is about to open.</p>
<p>Speculating, if the fonts-for-download is part of WebKit, it won&rsquo;t have its own rasteriser and the Doomsday.ttf might be possible. Speculating even more, Mail.app uses webkit, it would be possible to make an html mail message which links to malevolent fonts. It might even work on the iPhone, depending on how much code is shared between the iPhone and MacOSX.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple has separated the rasteriser in Safari from the rest of the OS. Perhaps Safari also checks the integrity of the font after download. In that case a bad font would just not load. But if a bad font isn&rsquo;t caught, and with a rasteriser in Safari, it could crash the app, but not the OS. In the worst possible case, if Safari uses the OS rasteriser, it could trigger a series of crashes which eventually take the whole OS down. And that is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p>At the very least, the downloading of fonts should be covered in the security prefs of Safari, and off by default. A bad font can do more damage than a run away javascript. Even Java and Flash don&rsquo;t have access to the core OS functions as fonts do. But these do have their own controls in the security prefs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just Safari. Will Firefox be able to follow to same safety precautions Safari might have?</p>
<p>Of course, all of these problems can be fixed in rasterisers and font handling code. But given that rasterisers, after almost 20 years of improvements, still contain problems, makes me wonder how fast browser and rasteriser builders can respond.</p>
<p>Just my 2¢ of gloom.</p>

<p>Although it is awfully boring for me to explain again and again the most simple notions of copyright law, I will try to explain them again. For this purpose I refer to a copyrighed picture in this new Typophile thread</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/43945">http://www.typophile.com/node/43945</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ali boxing poster&rdquo; shown in this thread is indubitably a &ldquo;work of art&rdquo;.  The date 1975 proves that this poster was made roughly 30 years ago. If the poster was made in the USA, then it will be protected by copyright for a period of 70 years post mortem auctoris (after the authors&rsquo;s death). So nobody except the author (here the designer or painter) or his/her assignee (e.g. the company which acquired the picture rights) is allowed to publish this picture.</p>
<p>It does not matter, whether this poster is photographed or scanned or reproduced by whatever technical means, and it does not matter, whether this reproduction is done in high or low resolution: In all these cases, you have to acquire the publication rights from the author or his/her assignees.</p>
<p>Even if you want to reproduce this poster in a very tiny size and in very low resolution, e.g. as a postal stamp, you will have to obtain the right to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, the publication of this Ali poster as a scanned reproduction in low resolution at the Typophile thread</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/43945">http://www.typophile.com/node/43945</a></p>
<p>constitutes a copyright infringement, unless he who uploaded this picture has acquired the right to reproduce this poster on the Typophile website.</p>
<p>Let us assume this legal information just given by me were not correct, and everybody were allowed to upload scans and photos of any pictures to any websites, then for example, everyone were allowed to scan all pictures painted by Picasso and upload them to whatever internet sites. This of course is definitely illegal and would constitute an infringement of copyright, in the very same way, as the publication of the Ali poster constitutes an infringement of copyright.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It doesn’t matter whether fonts are copyrightable or not. That only affects your ability to sue people who have been given copies illegally by someone who owns a legal copy. It doesn’t change the fact that fonts are only distributed subject to a licence agreement; if you don’t comply with the agreement, you could be sued for breach of contract, even if in your country fonts are not subject to copyright.</p>
<p>In a sense, therefore, the issue of copyright here is a red herring. The real issue is that fonts are licensed, and that the licence agreement (which is a contract between two parties, and applies regardless of copyright law) would in many cases be breached by distributing a font file in the manner presently supported by Safari. And since many users don’t bother reading or following licence agreements, the likelihood of a breach is high. Hence the complaints here about Apple’s marketing of Safari’s new feature.</p>
<p>Personally I would like to see support for subsetting and maybe a new file format for web fonts that can&rsquo;t be easily installed by end users.  This has been tried in the past (WEFT, for instance), and I think it&rsquo;s the only way that those of us who would like to be able to embed fonts on the web are going to be able to convince the commercial type foundries to permit this type of usage.  It also has the advantage of not requiring every visitor to your site to download large font files when all they needed was the letters ‘a’ through ‘z’. But it needs to be standardised across platforms and browsers, or nobody will want to use it.</p>

<p>I would hope that Safari is running its own text renderer (even if just a separate instance in a sandbox of sorts) because it is lacking many text rendering features standard in CoreText.  Neither required ligatures or kerning render, both of which feature in any standard NSTextField that you can do in Interface Builder in a dummy app (one that just has a single NIB file and no code).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why Apple turned off those features, but I do know they (oddly) have inconsistent font technology between their programs.  Why would it be that TextEdit (which uses the available-to-anyone NSTextView) have a more advanced engine that Safari or even Pages?  My only guess is that they don&rsquo;t expect very large documents in a program that would use NSTextView, or that it&rsquo;s not as highly optimized as the engines used in Safari or Pages where speed is more important, especially for long HTML pages or doctoral dissertations, and they&rsquo;ve cut out features or done other optimizations.</p>
<p>One of the main features I&rsquo;ve noticed (and irritated me to know end with some of my term papers) is that Pages does not support combining diacritics very well (needed for putting the tilde on a lc Q).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Erik&rsquo;s point related to font rasterizers (converting a vector glyph outline to a rasterized image of the requested glyph), not text layout (where features like contextual substitution are done), which are normally separate issues handled by different applications.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the Safari browser (for the desktop) uses it&rsquo;s own rasterizer; on Windows it uses it&rsquo;s own rasterizer which produces results similar to the Mac OS. But I am not sure that would be true on the iPhone, where there could be advantages to sharing the system&rsquo;s rasterizer, and the architects may have seen this as a safer environment than the desktop (which would probably be a bad idea!)</p>
<p>Although it may seem like it&rsquo;s a stretch that a font could crash a system or application, it is entirely possible, and I&rsquo;d guess that this aspect of &ldquo;font downloading/embedding&rdquo; has not been sufficiently tested.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The issue raised at the head of this thread seems to be less about copyright protection and law than the responsibility of a company to keep its public statements in line with protected practice. Copyrights exist to protect an author&rsquo;s economic interest, and the basic test of infringement is whether or not the original owner of the copyright has suffered economic loss (actual or real potential) from the unauthorized use of the item for which the copyright was recorded.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli,</p>
<p>As usual, you resort to insults.</p>
<p>It is a simple fact that the US Copyright Office accepts the copyright registrations of digital fonts, and does so following an explicit policy decision made in 1992 (quoted below in the court judgment excerpt).</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, you are correct that the US Supreme Court has not ruled on the applicability of copyright to digital fonts. That&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t needed to, because no case has been appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court. Things don&rsquo;t need to be ruled on by the Supreme Court to be law in the USA.</p>
<p>However, Judge Whyte&rsquo;s 1998 summary judgment in the Adobe vs SSi case in Federal District Court did rule on this issue, and upheld the principle that digital fonts are subject to copyright. <a href="http://directory.serifmagazine.com/Ethics_and_Law/Copyright/judgement.php4">http://directory.serifmagazine.com/Ethics_and_Law/Copyright/judgement.php4</a></p>
<p>The relevant section of the judgment follows:</p>
<hr>
<p>In a 1988 Copyright Office Policy Decision, the Copyright Office determined that digitized typefaces were not copyrightable because they were not computer programs and required little selection or arrangement beyond that dictated by the uncopyrightable typeface design. &ldquo;Policy Decision on the Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces, &quot; 53 Fed. Reg. 38 1 lo-381 13 (September 29, 1988).</p>
<p>However, in 1992 the Copyright Office issued a final regulation regarding the registrability of &ldquo;computer programs that generate typefaces&rdquo; which appears to back off the 1988 policy decision, although the parties dispute this. The 1992 Regulation states:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After a careful review of the testimony and the written comments, the Copyright Office is persuaded that creating scalable typefonts using already digitized typeface represents a significant change in the industry since our previous Policy Decision. We are also persuaded that computer programs designed for generating typeface in conjunction with low resolution and other printing devices may involve original computer instructions entitled to protection under the Copyright Act. For example, the creation of scalable font output programs to produce harmonious fonts consisting of hundreds of characters typically involves many decisions in drafting the instructions that drive the printer. The expression of these decisions is neither limited by the unprotectible shape of the letters nor functionally mandated. This expression, assuming it meets the usual standard of authorship, is thus registrable as a computer program.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;Registrability of Computer Programs that Generate Typefaces,&rdquo; 57 Fed. Reg. 35 at pp.6201-2 (February 12, 1992)). Plaintiff contends that the 1992 Regulation supports protection for the scalable typefonts at issue. Defendants contend that the 1992 Regulation reaffirms the 1988 policy decision stating that digitized typefaces are not protectable.</p>
<p>Defendants base their assertion on the fact that the 1992 Regulation specifically states that it &ldquo;does not represent a substantive change in the rights of copyright claimants.&rdquo; Id. at 6202. They argue that the effect of the 1992 Regulation is merely to revise the procedure in referencing font-depicting data in the registration process. Thus, defendants contend that the numerical reference points that define an outline of a glyph are unprotectable as a matter of law.</p>
<p>Defendants argue that after one has filtered out the unprotectabie elements of plaintiffs software in order to compare what remains, one finds that minimal, if any, protectable expression remains. Thus, defendants state that &ldquo;merely manipulating an unprotectable font image to create another, slightly different (but still unprotectable) font image cannot possibly give rise to protectable expression . . . .&rdquo; Defs. Memo., pp. 15-16. Defendants assert that no matter what points are selected by the Adobe editor performing the process, they correspond directly to, and hence are determined by, the unprotectable font shape. Therefore, because the output is not protected and there cannot be any creativity in what the editor does to obtain the output, nothing is protectable.</p>
<p>Adobe contends that King copied literal expression.7 Adobe contends that while the shape of the glyph necessarily dictates some of the points to be chosen to create the glyph, it does not determine all the points to be chosen. Thus, each rendering of a specific glyph requires choices by the editor as to what points to select and where to place those points. Accordingly, Adobe asserts that the selection of points and the placement of those points are expression which is copyrightable in an original font output program. The actual code is dictated by the selected points.</p>
<p>Adobe relies on Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991) and argues that because the glyph coordinates are not prescribed entirely by the shape of the glyph they involve creativity and are protectable. &ldquo;To qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author. [citation omitted]. Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author . . . and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.&rdquo; . Id at 345. Further, &ldquo;the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.&rdquo; Id. Thus, Adobe argues that because there is some creative choice by the editors who select the on-curve and off-curve reference points, Adobe&rsquo;s font software programs are protectable.</p>
<p>Defendants contend that FontMonger and Fontographer go beyond the code and extract the coordinates and express the coordinates in absolute values. Thus, defendants assert that the source code is not being copied but only the coordinates or points which are not protectable. Defendants then assert that FontMonger and Fontographer create code based on the selection of the points which is necessarily dictated by the shape of the glyph. Defendants contend that because they only extracted the points, they have not infringed because the points themselves are not protectable.</p>
<p>The evidence presented shows that there is some creativity in designing the font software programs. While the glyph dictates to a certain extent what points the editor must choose, it does not dictate every point that must be chosen. Adobe has shown that font editors make creative choices as to what points to select based on the image in front of them on the computer screen. The code is determined directly from the selection of the points. Thus, any copying of the points is copying of literal expression, that is, in essence, copying of the computer code itself.</p>
<p>Further, the selection of points is not dictated by functional concerns only. See 57 Fed. Reg. 6201-2. Defendants argue that efficiency is the key which is driven by the goal of minimizing the number of reference points. However, simply because there are several ways to create the same glyph, some being more efficient than others, i.e. using fewer points, does not mean there is no creativity in the process of creating the software to produce the glyphs. That some creativity is involved is illustrated by the fact that two independently working programmers using the same data and same tools can produce an indistinguishable output but will have few points in common. Accordingly, the court finds that the Adobe font software programs are protectable original works of authorship.</p>
<hr>
<p>After this, I think I need to revert back to my principle of not responding to Uli, which I let lapse after nearly a year.</p>

<p>1)</p>
<p>Mr. Phinney&rsquo;s statement <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;most countries recognize digital fonts as software&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a fairy tale and will remain a fairy tale, because Mr. Phinney could not prove that &ldquo;most countries&rdquo; recognize fonts as software.</p>
<p>2)</p>
<p>I predicted elsewhere that Mr. Phinney would again quote this old hat, the SSI &ldquo;preliminary judgement&rdquo; alias &ldquo;summary judgement&rdquo; (in Germany &ldquo;einstweilige Verfügung&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Everyone knows that &ldquo;preliminary judgements&rdquo; are &ldquo;preliminary&rdquo; and hence cannot be generalized, because no trial took place. Furthermore, Mr. Phinney did not disclose the most &ldquo;relevant section&rdquo;, namely this one:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Based on the foregoing, the court grants Adobe&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment on its claim of copyright infringement of its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Utopia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> software program, denies defendants' cross-motion on the copyright claims, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->denies Adohe&rsquo;s motion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for summary judgment on the patent claims, denies defendants' countermotion on the patent claims and denies Ares' motion for summary judgment on the third-party complaint.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This means: Firstly, the preliminary judgment refers to the font Utopia only, to no other fonts sold by Adobe. Secondly, the preliminary judgment denied Adobe&rsquo;s motion. In my document about this preliminary judgement</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ssi.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ssi.pdf</a></p>
<p>I stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adobe did not dare to seek a trial due to the fact that Adobe’s motions concerning Slimbach’s patent claims were denied by the district court.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do not know an American Copyright Law nor do I know an American Supreme Court decision ruling that fonts are copyrightable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Nor, apparently, do you know US law.  There is no need for there to be a US Supreme Court ruling for something to qualify as legal precedence (as a minor addition/correction to Thomas&rsquo;s statement about the US Supreme Court not needing to rule on something to make it law, well, no court can make anything law in the US, they only interpret extant law).  As well, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;preliminary judgement&rdquo; in American law, so I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean by that but based on a quick question to a German friend (note I explicitly don&rsquo;t claim to know the German system and am only speculating), I think you&rsquo;ve confused summary judgement with preliminary injunction, which are very different (and this confirmed by the BEOLINGUS dictionary).  A summary judgement is only preliminary in that it takes place before the primary case, to rule on whether or not claims are triable, and my guess in German would be &ldquo;beschleunigtes Urteilsverfahren&rdquo;.  Courts can still create precedence in these judgements (in the US), as evidence is presented just as they would be in a normal case.</p>
<p>SSI would want the court to rule that copyrightable did not extend to the font software thus avoiding the entire court case.  The court stated that they are protectable, and thus Adobe can continue in their case against SSI, which would then involve proving that SSI did indeed violate the copyright.  If SSI had succeeded, there would have been no need for Adobe to attempt to show how their software was copied, because the court would have ruled that it wasn&rsquo;t copyrightable.  This is the point of a summary judgement in US law.  Regarding the copyrightability and generalization of the ruling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parties do not dispute that defendant King had access to plaintiffs programs.5 Thus, the primary issue in this case is whether the material at issue is protectable expression under the Copyright Act&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, defendants contend that the numerical reference points that define an outline of a glyph are unprotectable as a matter of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, the court finds that the Adobe font software <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are protectable original <!-- raw HTML omitted -->works<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of authorship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is indeed a ruling that can be generalized.  Otherwise the court would have stated &ldquo;Accordingly, the court finds that Utopia is a protectable original <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of authorship.&rdquo;  But it didn&rsquo;t, leaving the judgement open for reference in other cases.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A summary judgement is only preliminary in that it takes place before the primary case, to rule on whether or not claims are triable, and my guess in German would be “beschleunigtes Urteilsverfahren”.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Such terminological discussions do not make much sense, because English is not my mother tongue and German is not your mother tongue. The term “beschleunigtes Urteilsverfahren” is a criminal proceeding in Germany, and the term &ldquo;preliminary judgement&rdquo; is used by me and others as another expression or as a synonym for &ldquo;summary judgement&rdquo; in the USA.</p>
<p>Instead of terminological discussions, you should look at the reality which will open your eyes so that you will recognize that the SSI &ldquo;summary judgement&rdquo; does not prove that the Adobe fonts are copyrightable in the USA or elsewhere.</p>
<p>For instance, Paul King has been selling the SSI fonts alias Adobe fonts many years after the lawsuit. And these SSI fonts alias Adobe fonts are even today still downloadable from numerous websites. (Miss Tiffany does not like links to such sites, so that you will have to browse for these sites for yourself.)</p>
<p>All this would not have been accepted by Adobe, if the Adobe fonts alias SSI fonts were copyrightable.</p>
<p>What is more, Adobe&rsquo;s entire Font Folio collection (the unmodified fonts, not the SSI clones) is downloadable for free from numerous websites. This would not be accepted by Adobe, if the Adobe Font Folio fonts were copyrightable in the USA or elsewhere.</p>
<p>And as regards font CDs, Adobe&rsquo;s entire Font Folio collection can be bought for a few cents as commercial ripoff CDs. I documented this at my website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/index.html#OSTEUROPA">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/index.html#OSTEUROPA</a></p>
<p>All this would not be accepted by Adobe, if the Adobe Font Folio fonts were copyrightable in the USA or elsewhere. The SSI &ldquo;summary judgement&rdquo; alias &ldquo;preliminary judgement&rdquo; is entirely useless and proves nothing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This means: Firstly, the preliminary judgment refers to the font Utopia only, to no other fonts sold by Adobe. Secondly, the preliminary judgment denied Adobe’s motion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Utopia was used as a test case in the Adobe vs. SSi lawsuit, and was accepted and understood as such by both parties. Of course Judge Whyte&rsquo;s acceptance of Adobe&rsquo;s motion for a summary judgement on the copyright of the Adobe font applies to the other fonts in the case: it was acceptance of the copyrightability of fonts (at which point SSi quickly agreed to settle out of court: they understood that the judgement applied to all the fonts, not just Utopia, even if you dont').</p>
<p>What Judge Whyte denied was the motion for a summary judgement on the specific <!-- raw HTML omitted -->patents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> claimed by Adobe. So he accepted the motion regarding the general issue of font copyright, which he judged in favour of, but he denied the motion regarding the patents. Note that this does not mean that he denied the patents, but that he denied to motion to make a summary judgement on them: the patent issue would have to be decided in court. The copyright issue could be decided by summary judgement, since the US Copyright Office had already established in principle that fonts could be copyrighted as computer programs. What the judgement needed to establish was whether the fonts, and particularly the outlines, met the requisite legal criteria of creativity to be protectable by copyright. And Judge Whyte decided that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->yes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they did, and that summary judgement is now legal precedence. I don&rsquo;t know what the role of precedence is in German law, but in in US law, derived from English common law, is is extremely important.</p>
<p>Your later argument that infringing fonts are still available through various sources is not evidence that fonts are copyrightable. Unlike trademarks, which one is obliged to defend or lose, one is under no obligation to defend one&rsquo;s copyright, and the copyright is retained regardless of whether the holder actively prosecutes infringement. I happen to know something of the material cost in time and energy that the SSi lawsuit put on Adobe&rsquo;s type group, that it delayed the development of new products and tied up key people for more than a year. Frankly, I&rsquo;m not surprised that Adobe are not launching lawsuits at every infringement of their copyright. Like reasonable people, they pick their fights.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;and the term “preliminary judgement” is used by me and others as another expression or as a synonym for “summary judgement” in the USA.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is not a synonym. There is nothing &lsquo;preliminary&rsquo; about a summary judgement, any more than there is about a summary execution.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>vanblokland:</p>
<p>I think your comments are spot on.  I was playing with this feature yesterday and was able to crash Safari, using a font described <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Precisely the problem you described and a relatively trivial example (i.e. overflowing the argument stack).  On the Mac, Webkit is passing the downloaded font data off to the ATS system service which does the rasterization:</p>
<p><a href="http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/browser/trunk/WebCore/platform/graphics/mac/FontCustomPlatformData.cpp#L41">http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/browser/trunk/WebCore/platform/graphics/mac/FontCustomPlatformData.cpp#L41</a></p>
<p>So bugs in ATS can be exploited using Safari.  It&rsquo;s quite possible that this code could be tightened up and made more secure but I think some thought needs to be put in to making sure it gets there and not just assuming that it is secure.  With Firefox, we have the same concern, relying on underlying platform API&rsquo;s needs to be done carefully.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I think the same thing is probably possible with downloaded PDF files containing embedded fonts.  Using Freetype or another rasterizer is possible but definitely not an easy task, especially when you want the code to be efficient.</p>
<p>John Hudson:</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve never quite understood is to what exactly the Adobe vs. SSi case really applies to.  The hints?  The outlines themselves?  Without hints is a font really a &ldquo;program&rdquo;?!?</p>
<p>Put another way, if someone takes a TrueType font and copies the outlines to make a SVG font (no hints) are they in copyright violation?  Would the same user be in violation if they used the outline within a vector graphic of some sort and distributed that (i.e. something that still contains the outline)?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these are just theoretical issues but real issues that web designers need to be able to understand.  &ldquo;No embedding&rdquo; flags, originally intended for use with Word documents, don&rsquo;t really explain much in this context.</p>

If I remember correctly from having read earlier, either by (imho false) court judging or  by copyright office regulation, font files per se (so even without hints) are considered font &ldquo;sofware&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actually, Uli is wrong in a lot of respects (because even if we disapprove of certain laws, they are laws), and while I disapprove of fonts being protected as &ldquo;software&rdquo;, I do think they need to be protected in some way (as &ldquo;work of art&rdquo; e.g.).
His argument in one of his writings is telling however: If you draw an outline and save the font, the stipulated &ldquo;software code&rdquo; is generated automatically. Your work was not authoring software code, but of designing (as an artist) outlines.</p>

<p>It is? It is not universally the case that it is unlawful to use images, and a whole body of law concerning &lsquo;fair use&rsquo; tells that tale. Fonts, unless one is using the software in some journalistic pursuit of typographic commentary, have no fair use outside of license. SSI, was a troll under the bridge between proprietary and common font formats. They have no more foot stomping or hand biting to offer the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you please specify where I used the legal term “software”?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. The continued circular opinions/arguments represent you as a waste of time with a mouth, but little or no ear function. When one does not understand the law even if one reads it, one does not understand typography even when one sees it, and ones grasp of type technology is second only to many billions of others, I think it is fair to say one should sit down, silence themselves and listen. Perhaps that applies to you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know Uli was being rhetorical, but he seems to have a typically incomplete knowledge of copyright law. He needs to look up concepts like fair use (U.S.) and fair dealing (Canada, U.K., some other countries). In short, you can post screenshots with attribution in many contexts without infringement. The same goes for photographs and other copyrighted works.</p>
<p>I don’t see how fair use or fair dealing would cover embedding fonts in Web pages even if they were copyrightable (or even considering that font <!-- raw HTML omitted -->files<!-- raw HTML omitted --> actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copyrightable). Hence, Uli’s point is rather off topic. But the objection “The Web is all about replication of copyrighted works, so why should fonts be any different?” is one that merits discussion.</p>

<p>The reason I started the thread was that I found Apple&rsquo;s positioning of the technology problematic and somewhat misleading, especially given the sensitivity and controversy swirling around the subject.</p>
<p>Anyway James Arboghast sent me the following notes off-list (too busy to contribute himself) suggested I post them here&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSS font embedding is mainly a distribution issue and a commercial 
rights issue. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In principle, copyright is concerned with both intellectual property 
rights (art and design) and distribution rights (commercial vending). 
In practice, when copyright &ldquo;law&rdquo; and litigation are applied to 
unauthorized distribution of fonts, the principal of law is applied, not the letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irrespective of state-defined copyright legislation in a given 
country, and whether or not digital type outlines and fonts are 
&ldquo;copyrightable&rdquo;, font makers and vendors are automatically granted 
commercial rights&mdash;specifically the right to profit from their 
invention, design, and sale of their commercial font product(s)&mdash;like 
all other producers of artwork, design or software products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commercial rights of font makers, including the right to profit 
from their invention, design and sale of retail font products, are 
upheld on a case-by-case basis, usually in the &ldquo;court of professional opinion&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unauthorized distribution of commercial font products is typically 
prohibited by individual font product EULAs, which are &ldquo;legally binding&rdquo;
contracts between the font maker or vendor/distributor, and all users.
EULA contracts are enforcable by private litigation, independently of 
state-defined copyright legislation. EULA and commercial rights of 
font makers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enforcable, and have been enforced, 
by private litigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retail OpenType fonts are commercial software by definition, as they 
contain OpenType feature programs. They are also commercial products, 
irrespective of whether or not they are software programs or 
&ldquo;copyrightable&rdquo;. All commercial products are protected from 
unauthorized distribution by commercial law in the U.S. and Germany, 
Australia, Great Britain, France, Poland, New Zealand, Japan, Norway, 
most western countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retail TrueType and Type1 fonts, whether they are definable as 
&ldquo;software&rdquo;/&ldquo;programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;copyrightable&rdquo; or not, are nonetheless 
commercial products issued with EULAs and protected from unauthorized 
distribution by commercial law in the U.S. and Germany, Australia, 
Great Britain, France, Poland, New Zealand, most western countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copyright legislation in individual countries has nothing to do with 
the price of fish in China Also try: &ldquo;the funny fish forging industry&rdquo; 
;-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSS font embedding is mainly a distribution issue affecting the 
commercial rights of font makers and vendors/distributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the text of Judge Whyte&rsquo;s summary judgement on the copyright question, which Thomas posted above. It is very clear. It is important to bear in mind that what US copyright law considers a computer program and what it considers a sufficient degree of creativity to qualify for copyright protection are not what you or I might consider them. The USCO defines a computer program as &lsquo;a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result&rsquo;. That is a very generous definition, especially if one pays attention to the allowance for both direct and indirect use. I don&rsquo;t doubt that some people might want to argue with that definition, or propose alternative definitions, but for the sake of US copyright law that is the definition that counts.</p>
<p>The other thing that is important to bear in mind is that, as Judge Whyte noted in his judgement, citing precedence, &lsquo;the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice&rsquo;. That is to say, it is not necessary for a work to exhibit a huge amount of creativity &ndash; what I&rsquo;m tempted to call a &lsquo;romantic amount&rsquo;, since many popular notions of creativity are strongly influenced by romanticism &ndash;; the mere presence of creativity, in even a slight amount, is deemed worthy of protection.</p>
<p>Bearing those two things in mind, this is the key passage of Judge Whyte&rsquo;s judgement (by emphasis:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;The evidence presented shows that there is some creativity in designing the font software programs. While the glyph dictates to a certain extent what points the editor must choose, it does not dictate every point that must be chosen. Adobe has shown that font editors make creative choices as to what points to select based on the image in front of them on the computer screen. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The code is determined directly from the selection of the points. Thus, any copying of the points is copying of literal expression, that is, in essence, copying of the computer code itself.'<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>As the saying goes, A hah! Now I understand what they meant. Granted, I think this vastly understates what is involved, both technically and creatively, in designing a typeface but I at least see what lawyers have hung their hats on as a point of legality&ndash;or the basis for their litmus test. Whatever we typography lovers and type designers really think or express as what is involved&ndash;or what could be stolen is most likely too complicated to prove or disprove and would involve varied opinions of type geeks instead of absolute sightings by judges and lawyers.</p>

<p>So from this description that would imply that someone who uses a glyph outline in a vector drawing program and distributes that outline contained within a vector file format like SVG is actually violating the copyright of the font in the U.S, since that file contains a copy of the protected outline.</p>
<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t the same apply to the copy of FB Moderno contained in Headline.swf used to display the content title on this page, a font I have not licensed?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What does being a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have to do with anything?
I thought we’re talking about the definition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good joke.</p>
<p>What you call &ldquo;software&rdquo; is called &ldquo;computer programme&rdquo; in copyright laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Computer programmes&rdquo; (in your non-copyright-law parlance &ldquo;software&rdquo;) are &ldquo;literary works&rdquo; written by authors. There are copyright laws which explicitely define that &ldquo;computer programmes&rdquo; are &ldquo;literary works&rdquo;, e.g. the United Kingdom Copyright Act:</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/UK-Copyright-Act.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/UK-Copyright-Act.jpg</a></p>
<p>The author of the &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; of a &ldquo;computer programme&rdquo; is called the &ldquo;computer programmer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Copyright protection only subsists in original works of authorship, e.g. in &ldquo;computer programmes&rdquo; as &ldquo;literary works&rdquo;, written by &ldquo;authors&rdquo;, e.g. here the &ldquo;computer programmers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For definition of &ldquo;authorship&rdquo; etc. see e.g. the American Copyright Law:</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/USA-Copyright-LAW.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/USA-Copyright-LAW.jpg</a></p>
<p>I hope this answers your question:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What does being a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have to do with anything?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I hope that you now understand that &ldquo;talking about the definition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; means &ldquo;talking about the definition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->computer programme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson stated above in this thread:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The USCO defines a computer program as ’a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result’.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is not only the definition used by the USCO (US Copyright Office), but much more important, it is the definition in the US Copyright Law itself:</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/USA-Definition.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/USA-Definition.jpg</a></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you’re asking is “did John G. Roberts, Chief Justice of the United States, by saving that file, create a unique piece of computer code (ie, software) that describes a particular visual design that he created” then the answer is “yes”.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Firstly, a person who is not a computer programmer and who has not learnt computer programming languages and who is therefore not able to write computer programmes cannot be the writer of a computer programme.</p>
<p>Secondly, a person who draws circles with the mouse in a vector drawing programme (e.g. Coreldraw) makes circle drawings, but he does not write computer programmes.</p>

<p>That completely contradicts what you yourself said earlier in the same post.</p>
<p>If I use a WYSIWYG programming tool to create a simple program [please note that there is no such thing as a “computer programme”], then I am the creator of that program, despite the fact that I don’t know C++ or any other programming language well enough to actually write the code itself. If I create an entire font in FontLab and save it as a TrueType Font, then that is considered software and I am considered its creator, despite the fact that I did not actually code the file myself.</p>
<p>Computer programmer is (at least here) a protected title that requires at least a bachelor’s degree in computer programming, so obviously, the answer to your question is neither yes nor no, but rather, “Yes, if he has a degree in computer programming as well as being a judge”, which is of course completely irrelevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>Well, here are my impressions, even if this is slightly offtopic here:</p>
<ul>
<li>loading times (browser): ages.</li>
<li>loading times (pages): 
without flash - slower than IE6, IE7 and Firefox.
with flash - faster than Firefox and IE7, but slower than IE6.</li>
<li>options and settings: too limited for my liking.</li>
<li>CSS rendering: well, almost perfect, I admit it.</li>
<li>type rendering: blurry (on CRT I do not use any smoothing, if possible).</li>
<li>cache: IE, Firefox and Opera allow browsing the cache. Why Safari should not?</li>
<li>plugins (Firefox-style)? Bwahahahaha.
and many, many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the support of web-fonts, right now there are no alternative browsers to compare with, so&hellip; still waiting for next version of Opera, which supposedly will support it.</p>
<p>Would I use Safari for everyday browsing? God, no! Would I remove/replace my default browser for Safari? At least, not now. I&rsquo;m keeping it only for web design compatibility checks.</p>
<p>Maybe under Mac the things are different, but I seriously doubt it. This is a design issue, not a platform one. Apple simply do not provide enough advanced options for customizing the browser design/behaviour. Remember the discussion if there is an option to disable the web-fonts? Of course, Apple are new on this market, but Safari on my WinXP desktop still looks like an oversized iPhone :D</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s like saying a painter doesn&rsquo;t make paintings&hellip;his paintbrush does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2001dltr0024.html%22">http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2001dltr0024.html&quot;</a></p>
<p>That read seems specific to Fractals. A minute subsection of the complete works of computer programs. It&rsquo;s also an opinion piece that simply described the various potential approaches.</p>
<p>But the argument seems to be &lsquo;does the creator of the work own the copyright, or does the creator of the software that the creator of the work used to create their own software own the copyright?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To go back to the painter, that wouldn&rsquo;t that be like arguing: does the artist owns the copyright to the painting or does the manufacturer of the paintbrush and paints own the copyright?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apple simply do not provide enough advanced options for customizing the browser design/behaviour. &quot;</p>
<p>Nope. Apple doesn&rsquo;t emphasize user customization in most of their UI design philosophies. Subjectively, of course, that makes it a bad design for folks that prefer that.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve found nearly all browser suck in Windows. Safari is OK. Firefox is OK, but has constant memory leaks and weird behavior. IE7 has an incredibly obtuse UI but doesn&rsquo;t suck nearly as much as IE6. I actually rediscovered Opera as of late and kind of like that.</p>

<p>True, and Apple&rsquo;s Safari page remains unchanged. Not heard from many type designers, so maybe this positioning isn&rsquo;t considered a big deal?

In general, it seems like fonts embedded in Flash files have the same problems as downloadable fonts in Safari, namely that the actual details of the EULA effectively disallows their use in this way without special permission.</p>
<p>A more subtle point is that it seems like the FB Moderne EULA also effectively disallows the use of glyph outlines contained in a vector formatted image that is publically available, since &ldquo;font software&rdquo; seems to cover the set of points that determine glyph outlines.</p>

<p>Frankly, some of the contents of font EULA agreements seem byzantine beyond belief.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I poked around in Font Book and picked &ldquo;Century Schoolbook&rdquo;.  Not a normal Mac OS X system font, probably installed with MS Office.  The font information shows Monotype as the foundry along with a license URL.  Hmmm, page not found, okay, dig through the Monotype fonts.com site to find their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->single-user EULA agreement<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I&rsquo;m assuming is what applies to me.  Section 12 basically disallows use of a font in anything other than a non-editable static graphic and only for &ldquo;personal or internal business use&rdquo; and not &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; use.  Definitions for these terms are given but it&rsquo;s not quite clear where &ldquo;for use in a website graphic&rdquo; falls.  It also appears to disallow anyone from sending anything containing a glyph outline, such as a path within an Illustrator file or a vector graphic formatted image like SVG, to a user without a license.</p>
<p>But wait, dumping out the OS/2 table for the font shows that fsType embedding bits are set to &ldquo;editable embedding&rdquo;, so maybe it really is okay to use in a website graphic?  And maybe this could be used with Safari as long as the font is not cached?</p>
<p>Seems like font users who in good faith try to determine &ldquo;can I use this font for this purpose?&rdquo; need something that&rsquo;s a little simpler and more straightforward.</p>

<p>How would a font user know that?  I don&rsquo;t think Office ever announced that it was installing those fonts as part of the install process and the data within the font itself indicates something else (i.e. that the license is covered by the Monotype EULA)!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right about this but my guess is that other applications also install fonts without explicitly altering the license notice within the name table strings.  Makes it difficult to track down the EULA that actually applies.  Same probably goes for all the lovely fonts that ship with Mac OS X, are they covered by the Apple EULA when the font data indicates something else?  Hard to figure out from a font user&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Document<!-- raw HTML omitted --> embedding (as defined in the OpenType spec) is permitted…<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Hmmm, are you distinguishing document embedding from a webpage&rsquo;s use of downloadable fonts?

<p>Safari 3.1 for Windows and Mac supports the embedding of “sfnt fonts” (TrueType, OpenType PS, OpenType TT) using the font-face declaration. Technically the fonts are not embedded in the website, but they are simply linked like an image file. Thus the fonts need to be stored on a public server. Since you cannot upload commercial fonts to a public webserver, you are limited to freeware fonts. FDI fonts.info believes in the future of web fonts, so we decided to provide webdesigners with a set of high-quality web fonts supporting a wide range of character encodings.</p>

<p>Yes, my reading of the OT spec is that the embedding permissions relate to fonts being embedded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within<!-- raw HTML omitted --> document files. With EOT the font is not within the file but is tied to it via the URL-binding system. MS consulted with the industry at the time. However, over the years many vendors have put additional restrictions in their EULAs, around commercial embedding (eBooks), and technologies they don&rsquo;t like, such as PDF, or more commonly EOT.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Matthew, I just could not find that site! (I noticed the bug report form built into Safari, but it was way to generic. Also, it was so impersonal, you could never know whether the mails incoming to the mailbox from that form are not redirected directly to /dev/null ;-) )</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s something I really disapprove of with Apple. Absolute intransparency. Also: even bugreport.apple.com is a) well hidden b) you need a registration (oh, the first option they offer you is 3000+ USD/year&hellip; of course, if you scroll down, you&rsquo;ll find the 99USDp.a. for students, and at the very bottom, as if they did not want you to notice, the free &ldquo;OnLine Membership&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The stipulated aim of making everything as easy for the user as possible, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to care about technical details&rdquo; is good. It should be the primary task of good USER (oriented) interface design. However, it should not completely put the user under tutelage, if he <em>wants</em> to care for technical details.</p>
<p>At least in the current situation it gave me the feeling, that bug reports are actually <em>not_welcome</em>. Or why else would you make it so hard to post improvement suggestions?</p>
<p>Let me have been mistaken. Let me find out, I was wrong!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The bugreport system is open to members of Apple Developer Connection, and they do make it clear that it&rsquo;s free (I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had any indication to the contrary), it&rsquo;s designed for developers more than for end-users, because end users tend to not be able to describe in the clarity and detail that is necessary generally to diagnose problems.</p>
<p>They want registration for more serious natures so they can follow up.  If they have a problem or a question they want a way to contact you and it integrates within their main bugtracking system for all software.  I&rsquo;m sure also WebKit has one as well.  While I still have some bugs that have been left inattentive for 3 years, others have been rapidly fixed, and not necessarily in the order I would have thought (eg, easy things are unfixed, hard things get fixed).  Partly it depends on how many people submit the same complaint.</p>

<p>Apple says you can use any font (obviously according to it&rsquo;s licence) but I think they refer to any type of font.</p>
<p>I mean, if it only supported TTF fonts what good would that be.  Still according to licences, but you still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use <em>any</em> font in that case, only a fraction of them.</p>
<p>Also like a photocopier, some photocopiers can only photocopy a small area, so a big one that says, &ldquo;This photocopier can photocopy ANYTHING&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;You are encouraged and legally entitled to duplicate material you may not otherwise have licence to distrubute as long as you use this machine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Give apple a break, they could easily have made their own custom font format for safari fonts only, but they didn&rsquo;t…</p>

<p>As I have described above, this was the impression I got &ldquo;from the outside&rdquo;.
So, according to you, it&rsquo;s worth getting into it. And I will, when I find the time (I like to do stuff either completely or not at all: no half jobs. This goes for bug reporting (being as specific, as possible, describing the problem with technical details, etc.).</p>

<p>I wanted to write you directly anyway (in a different matter), so I will.
However let me ask, are you somehow involved in Webkit.</p>
