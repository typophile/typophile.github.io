  features. Our ambition is to create an open, ever evolving book to share our knowledge
  and creations.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nWe've carefully researched and selected points
  of interest from both past and current times. But you are all invited to add your
  own. They could be your own work, or someone's you admire.\r\n\r\nWe are international,
  and contributions in any language are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThe web app is free
  to use. You can find it here: <a href=\"http://www.typomapp.com/webapp\">typomapp.com/webapp</a>\r\n\r\n\u2013

  body: As a typographic and cartographic nut, it's interesting to see how even typography
    can be involved in GIS (Geographic Information Systems). Wonderful!

  body: "This is just great that you included Raffaello Bertieri, although his activity
    is more associated with Milano (where he set up his printing press, and where
    he published his famous magazine \u201CIl Risorgimento Grafico\u201D) or Asso
    (where he was mayor), rather than his native Firenze."
