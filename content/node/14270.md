  body: I'm going to say that it's "lettering"; that is to say a bit of custom type
    and not a typeface. Why? Because the "x" is symmetrical, the bar of the "t" is
    heavier than one might expect, and the crossbar of the small cap "h" is also heavy.
    It all says "constructed" to me. I'll be surprised if it's actually a font.

  body: It has the look of an old Letraset (Rubdown tansfer lettering) Catalog typeface.
    Do you have any idea when the mark was created? It might help with the ID

  body: How about customizing <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bogusky2/gogobig/gogobig/testdrive.html?s=Chloroxy+tech&p=60">Gogobig</a>?  It's
    pretty close to start, so it might serve your purposes just to go ahead and try
    to slightly customize an existing font.. because as everyone else has already
    suggested with reasoning, this design seems to be lettered.
