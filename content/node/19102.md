    occasion I enjoyed a coupla Rolling Rock beers which bear the year of this celebration
    in my life :D\r\n\r\nWe had a great day at the Dells in Wisconsin, kinda like
    what the Ozarks are to Missouri :D\r\n\r\nAnyhow, thanks to all for helping make
    this a great celebration for me! Sincerely . . . Since most of my work is done
    in my studio with little physical human interaction, my virtual friends at Typophile
    become my closest co-workers!\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nStuart :D"

    an easy thing to enjoy, although I'm sure you would appreciate the kitsch quotient.
