body: I found a font on TinyPrints.com that I like. They call it "Deco Sans." I'd
  like to find it on-line and download it for use. However, there seems to be more
  than one style of "Deco Sans" (e.g. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alan-ronn/deco-sans/)
  Is this a generic name used for a particular style in the world of typography?

    font if we could see a sample of it. Searching their site for Deco Sans yields
    nothing, using their Search box.\r\n\r\nCan you show us the sample you saw?\r\n\r\n-
