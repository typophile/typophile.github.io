body: "Hello people,\r\nI'm asking for feedback on a project I've been working on
  the past 9 months. Everything started with the [[http://www.polidesign.net/it/type|Type
  Design]] course @ Poli.Design in Milan. In a group of three people, we recieved
  the brief of creating some typeface to be used in high-res starting from a typeface
  with a low-resolution. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-02_3474.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-03_6261.png]\r\nWe
  found this old anatomy book (\u2192 from which the name, \"anatomia\") printed in
  the early XX century, set in this ugly scottish face with exaggerated details that
  made it work in small sizes.\r\nOur idea was to bring the skeleton, the proportions
  and some characteristic aspects into a grotesque-formula based typeface, being that
  the historical evolution of these modern faces. The details used as optical-helping
  elements in small sizes would become characteristic elements in big sizes (eg. the
  \"a\", \"R\" and \"t\" end, the axis of the terminals in \"c\", \"a\", \"f\").\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-01_6417.png]\r\nNeed
  feedback now! I like the brief and the result of the course, that's why I kept working
  by myself on it these following months. The semi\u2013condensed proportion make
  me think it's a bit uncertain as a weight, a bit lighter than a standard grotesk\u2013regular.
  My idea would be to release to the public a regular, medium and bold weights with
  matching italics, but I know it would be a very long process. Italics sound so funny,
  though, judging on the italics of thestarting typeface.\r\nWhat do you think of
  it? Please express your thoughts, every little opinion is very appreciated. \r\nHow
  can this character be fit in the huge range of quirky grotesks?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-04_6377.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-06_6013.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-05_5365.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prestypophile-07_5079.png]\r\nThank
  you for any feedback!"

  body: I was ready to dismiss this until I saw the text block, it's certainly an
    interesting take on a text grotesque!

      becoming the leader in innovation among grotesks. But I'm looking for spotting
      the strong points of it and giving it a sense. \r\n\u2014 By the way, these
      images are huge. Is there anyway I can edit the post and fix them?"

  body: I think it's quite an interesting experiment, and the face definitely has
    character. One little problem - because the tail of the 'a' is so exaggerated,
    it seems to be creating some spacing issues. Is there a way of taming it ever
    so slightly?

  body: "Interesting! I think this can become a desirable typeface. The main tricky
    thing I would say is deciding how much to polish it versus leaving it \"fauve\"
    (noting that some of the letterforms are in fact currently too regular to fit
    in).\r\n\r\nBTW some practical advice: if your former team-mates have given up
    on this, make sure you get that in writing...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What others have said. Plus, to me, the accentuated stroke modulation differentiate
    it from the majority of grotesques (which could be positive). For better legibility
    as a text face at small sizes, I would open up a bit characters like |C|, |G|,
    |e|, etc. Also, the |5| looks out of place.

  body: "I love this. It's fun to look at, because it looks familiar, yet utterly
    idiosyncratic. And I agree with @Birdseeding\u2014looking at individual letters,
    you think it's going to be frivolous, but then when you reach the text block,
    it's feels totally rational.\r\n\r\nMy only note is that it looks to me like the
    Frutiger /k/ is out of place here\u2014maybe try a broken /k/, or simply add a
    slight spur or curve to its legs."

    updated.\r\n@riccard0, true I opened a bit the characters. I think I'll fork it
    to another project that gets rid of its roots (\u2013\u2013> the scottish) and
    tries to give more power to this font's characteristics.\r\n@hrant a good balance
    between polished and accentuated would be my goal. Thanks for the practical advice,
    maybe forking it to another project would do the job anyway.\r\n@domdib My idea
    would be to keep this /a/ tail accentuated like other details in a \"poster version\".
    But...for the moment I'll maybe compress it a little. Even though I like to give
    a bit of non-equality.\r\n"

  body: "The E seems a bit dark. Also, I don't think the exaggerated tail of /a should
    be causing problems with spacing necessarily. If you see it next to /m the spacing
    is just about right, but then you have an /e kerned very close to the /m which
    disturbs the rhythm. I think I would kern some characters a bit loser and kern
    /a a tiny bit tighter.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I'm absolutely ecstatic to see
    this!  Others seem initially dismissive but I like the first images as well, but
    indeed particularly the text blocks. I don't know if this is an appropriate association,
    but it reminds me of French typefaces. I know that's a very general statement,
    but a few times I've seen typefaces like these which aren't perfectly balanced
    but you just know it will look amazing in print. Antique Olive is a fairly good
    example of what I mean. Coincidentally the few typefaces I've seen which have
    this kind of atmosphere were all done by French designers. I love this intuitive-rather-than-rational
    approach. I just commented on one of Alexander Katt's designs which I feel has
    a similar attitude to the design approach. I feel I need more of that.\r\n\r\nI'm
    eagerly looking forward to get this typeface. Italics and a bold weight would
    be fantastic, if you're up to the challenge."
