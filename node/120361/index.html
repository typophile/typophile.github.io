  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Varicose and spider veins can be a devastating part of life. This condition is not only unattractive but can be very painful and interfere with the sufferer�s ability to enjoy and lead a normal life. These veins can swell and <a href="http://spiderveintreatment.kinja.com/non-invasive-treatments-for-varicose-veins-1644199761?rev=1412835834827">camberwell skin clinic</a> protrude through the skin. Whether it�s the smaller thinner, sometimes reddish, bluish, or purple, protruding veins or the larger swollen blood vessels, they both twist and turn and make it difficult to look and feel confident. There is a solution for unhealthy veins and that is sclerotherapy. In the past, the only way to treat these types of veins was through surgical stripping. This process involved making incision(s) then inserting a wire into the vein, which was and still is quite painful. The process was not permanent and the spider/varicose veins returned.<p><p></p>
<p>Like any other medical condition if left untreated, poor vein health can worsen and lead to severe varicose vein disease and ulceration. Ulceration is when the skin around the vein actually opens up. There are several potentially serious complications that can arise from untreated varicose and spider veins. This is why it is important for people suffering from any of these conditions to seek attention and treatment right away before the condition worsens. It is vital to find the best and most efficient sclerotherapy clinic in Melbourne.<p><p></p>
<p>Fortunately, today there is a more desirable, successful, and less painful treatment for varicose and spider veins. A qualified and efficient sclerotherapy clinic can perform foam sclerotherapy sclerotherapy for varicose veins. This procedure involves injecting a foaming chemical solution into the infected veins causing the veins to harden and at that point the body will absorb these hardened veins over time. This procedure, unlike surgical stripping may cause minimal discomfort. Some patients have compared the sensations to a mosquito bite or a temporary stinging feeling. So, not only is the procedure less painful than the previous forms of treatment for these poor venous conditions, but it is also going to keep the varicose and spider veins from returning.<p><p></p>
<p>Patients will need to undergo a preliminary ultrasound evaluation to ensure the underlying veins, if present, that feed the spider and varicose veins are identified. This type of procedure is important to distinguish whether or not a patient will have a more difficult and moderate condition requiring more extensive processes. These procedures are still less painful than surgical stripping and more permanent. In the case of larger veins keeping the spider veins nourished, ultrasound guided sclerotherapy will be the best course of action. What this involves is a more guided process of injecting the vein hardening solution into the infected and nourishing veins. That is why it is important to be evaluated to ensure the best and most appropriate treatment is utilized. These procedures are very safe, less uncomfortable and more effective than the old procedure for treating these conditions. It is important to do the research and find out more on these processes before making any treatment decisions.<p><p></p>
