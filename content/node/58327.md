body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI am running a web design business and I'm still not
  happy with my logo. This is what I have right now: [[http://www.designbits.de|current
  logo and website]]\r\n\r\nLast night I had this idea and I wonder if's got potential:
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_mouse_5506.png]\r\n\r\nThe s-curve
  in particular looks a bit shabby. I probably need a few more hours of Illustrator
  practice to get it going.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if the concept makes any sense and
  if the \"DB\" mark should be any bigger or even placed somewhere else.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated. Thanks."

  body: "Timo, I think you are over thinking it, as it is often the case when working
    on your own things.\r\nWhat is it that you don't like about your current word
    mark? The idea of breaking apart the \"T\" works well in my opinion. \r\nAn alternative
    option could be to use a squarish sans which would allow you break down the whole
    \"BITS\" part.\r\nSome ideas: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/bs-mandrax/|Mandrax]]
