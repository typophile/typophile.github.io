body: 'Hello, <BR>I&#39;ve lurked here for quite some time and thought it&#39;d be
  appropriate to start posting, for a change. <BR>I found this forum through my mate
  Rob Irrgang and was genuinely impressed with the pool of knowledge that you guys
  are. I&#39;m very interested in typography, and even though I have no formal training
  I find it always interesting to read about it &#40;and I&#39;m well aware I don&#39;t
  know nearly enough&#41;. <BR>I hope to take part in the conversations as often as
  possible, and learn as much as I can from you guys &#40;and girls&#41;. <BR> <BR>cheers,
  <BR>Adriano <BR> <BR>PS: Pardon my sometimes erratic English... I&#39;m foreign
