body: "Hi Everyone,\r\nI'm a calligrapher and typographer who works mainly with Arabic
  .. yet I have a lot of tendencies to merge the modern design theory into my work
  but still in early stages... \r\n\r\nArabic characters are so organic and complicated
  compared to Latin characters and the lack of Typography development in this part
  of the world makes it even harder to explore the field more. so I'm looking here
  for feedback and critique to my personal works (link below) hopefully it will open
  my eyes to more inspirational opportunities \r\n\r\nhttp://majidalyousef.com/\r\ncheck
  the calligraphy and logotype galleries\r\n\r\nthank you :-)"

    a progressive work in this field. \r\nsome of these fonts are cool and some are
    just fonts :) I understand the technical difficulties. some of the fonts that
    resembles actual calligraphy scripts look so poor aesthetically compared to the
    authentic style, in the same time there is no much of characteristic that gives
    certain fonts graphical substance like their western counterparts.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "thank you for the example, the Rayhan looks nice for such a complex style.
    I like though the way you can use marks and accents like in handmade calligraphy.\r\n\r\nthere
    are though some notes I think this image will make my point clearer when talking
    about the specific calligraphy aesthetics. I know Rayhani calligraphy itself is
    an old style and was not matured enough compared to Thuluth which has superb proportions
    and beautiful details ..  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_design_5748.jpg]"
