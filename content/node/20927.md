body: "Hi all, I have recently designed my 2nd typeface, and was looking for some
  feed back, and any suggestions on issues to watch out for in the future\u2026 I
  know that my characters in both fonts have too thin of a stroke, and I\u2019m heaving
  kerning issues, it takes me as much time to kern as it does to do everything else,
  is that normal?"

  body: 'Just checking: did you finalize the SPACING of the font before starting the
    kerning process?  That''s the way to do it. Even if you did, kerning is a time-consuming
    process. It''s not easy to think of every possible combination. It helps to have
    text files handy so you can test everything visually (like in InDesign). '
