body: Working with ID CS3.0.1 -- job made up on one computer, move to another for
  final touches and printing -(both PC's...) the Times Roman font is not found, first
  computer a year or so older, font file looks identical... Older computer Has Times
  roman PS MT, newer just Times Roman. Havn't noticed another font doing anything
  like this. Can I ever get them to agree on Times Roman? And how>..?  Million Thanks...

    the same, size of file, name, file dates, attributes... why should I have to do
    this, with same OS, same ID version, same everything... we're just getting ID
    going (from Pagemaker...) and this is a set-back!\r\nWhen you embed, (would have
    to learn how to...) can you make changes etc. without the hassle of the font name
    difference?\r\nThanks"

    PS MT</a> is Monotype's version of TNR... The other one isn't -- <em>i.e.</em>,
    it's from another manufacturer. I agree with Russell that you should just install
    both versions of the font on each of your PCs.

  body: " I'd like to add to the suggestion made. Yes, put the other Times Roman on
    the other computer - but the addition is please remove the Times Roman that is
    residing there. You don't need any conflicts within the Times Roman family.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I'm on a MAC - and I have to live with a .Times Roman dfont in my system. I always
    kept my \"families\" of fonts in one suitcase, but thank's the the new system,
    can't do that. I must now how individual suitcases, and remove the conflicts.
    And FYI - there have been tons of conflicts with the Times New Roman!"
