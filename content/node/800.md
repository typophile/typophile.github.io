  body: ' Hi, folks - <BR> <BR>Re: Type Identification Board; Recent questions about
    Treacyfaces&#39; TF Arrow and potential inspirations for the Gucci brand logo.
    <BR> <BR>I agree that the TF Arrow A series appearance is a rather close match.
    But I have no idea whether the Gucci logo was drawn from scratch - although I&#39;ll
    conjecture that it was - or derived from type. <BR> <BR>The rounds in TF Arrow&#39;s
    weights are very generously circular, retouched appropriately. <BR> <BR>P.S.:
    True-cut italics for our TF Arrow now exist, and are of my design.  <BR> <BR>If
    anyone has further questions about our TF Arrow, any of our other Treacyfaces/Headliners
    fonts or custom typefaces or logos, you&#39;re welcome to e-mail me at the e-mail
    link on treacyfaces.com <BR> <BR>Be sure to sign up for information about our
    upcoming catalogue, and advance announcements of our new typefaces. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for specifying Treacyfaces types! <BR> <BR>&#40;Joe&#41; <BR> <BR>Joseph Treacy
