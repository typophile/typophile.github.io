  body: "I think it's quite good for a first attempt, but there are many more fonts
    like this. You should look up those fonts and make sure your font is clearly different.\r\n\r\nA
    font like this should also work great at pixel level. Say 8 pnts without anti-aliasing.
    To make this happen you should stick to a grid of 8 by 8 in your font-editor.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems your strokes don't have the same thickness everywhere, e.g. the middle horizontal
    stroke in a and e is to thick. This might also be an optical illusion, but in
    that case you should also change it. You should also have another look at the
    @.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "For a first attempt this is great. I definitely agree with 1996type that
    you should make sure that this typeface is clearly different than others in the
    genre.\r\nGreat first attempt though."

  body: "I think the 'K' and 'k' look out of place due to the sharp 45 degree angles
    that don't appear anywhere else. Maybe make them a little closer to the 'X' and
    'x'.\r\n\r\nAlso the 'Z' and '7' look like they've had their corners sliced off,
    but the '3' and 'z' do not.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
