  my Quantitative Methods project presentation which is about opening a baby shop,
  so I think it's better to use some nice fonts in the powerpoint, though I don't
  have any idea that what type would be good for it. Can you suggest some for me?
  Thank you so much!\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTYPO\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for my English,
  and I am not really a typo at all.\r\n"

    reason I ask is because for your school project you can go pretty far with the
    fonts supplied on your system or with Powerpoint. \r\n\r\nHere's a list of fonts

  body: ">Oh-ho, typo and powerpoint is like fire and water.\r\n\r\nWhy do you say
    that? If you're using an up to date Windows version of PPT the type should hold
    together pretty well on-screen. I'd agree that your best bet would be to keep
    it simple - don't go over the top with drop shadows, colors and transitions. Unless
    your audience is made up of a group of elite type designers using Comic Sans for
    the titles would be more than appropriate, otherwise maybe Arial Rounded for the
    titles. I'm sure some of those on the list will have some more imaginative choices.
    \r\n\r\nI've not used PPT on the Mac but I've seen some of the results on screen
    and for whatever reason the spacing is often messed up. Don't know if it's the
    type of font (Type 1 v TTF) or another problem. When asked, the engineers say
    that the most recent versions use the system renderer, and most Mac text looks
    fine elsewhere, so I don't understand why the results look bad. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions!\r\n\r\n@Norbert @Sebastian\r\n\r\nI use PC
    with powerpoint 2003. And I think I will have to present it on screen. Because
    of powerpoint 2003 I find that it seems to be able to embed TureType fonts if
    I choose 'package for CD', which means that it can run without powerpoint 2003.
    Yes I will not children-script-font, though I really want to use a couple of 'fashion'
    fonts in my powerpoint if it can. Or I really just need to use some normal fonts
    like arial or times? Thanks~\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTYPO"

    "Print & Preview" embedding is allowed. In this context it doesn't seem as if
    you need "Editable" embedding, but this can still be handy if you need to make
    modifications to the deck at the last minute.

    of the PPT issues on the Mac are related to fonts but TrueType is not the problem.
    \ Macs use Truetype just fine. Problems arrive when you choose the version of
    say Times for example that is native to PC but show it on a Mac. The Mac takes
    its version of Times as a substitute but the metrics are not the same so spacing
    gets messed up.  The only thing you can do is always use the bundled Microsoft
    fonts on all the machines that touch the PPT file.  This is limiting for typography
    and can be complicated by versions of PPT being mixed.\r\nThe other thing is that
    Microsoft does not spend a lot of effort porting PPT to Mac since most Mac people
    are not fond of it (or else MS just doesn't care about us). \r\nI always use Adobe's
    PDF to make presentations.  It does a much better job than PPT on any platform
    and you can embed fonts so typography is not limited to the Microsoft bundle of
    wonders.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
