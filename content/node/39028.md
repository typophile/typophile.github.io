  This is a logo for a church. It's a young pentacostal church founded four years
  ago and consist of students and young families, mainly aged 25-30 years. They strive
  hard to not grow older - thus the logo is aiming a bit lower.\r\n\r\n<strong>Brief:</strong>\r\n\xD8ystein:
  \"Strong, but still nice and caring. You know, like my two meter tall grandfather
  with the worlds kindest eyes\".\r\nPer Olav: \"It should maybe express fellowship?\"\r\n\xD8ystein:
  \"Hey, be creative!\"\r\nPer Olav: \"Yeah. We don't really want our people to love
  it at first. We want to get responses like 'this is really challenging me' from
  the church.\"\r\n\xD8ystein: *grin*\r\n\r\n<strong>Some of my thoughts:</strong>\r\nChurch
  identities have a long tradition of graphic misery.\r\nIt should not try to say
  \"everything\" (with crosses, doves, hands and perhaps some architechtual drawings
  filtered into each other).\r\nIt needs to be a bit tough.\r\nIt has to be very simple.\r\n\r\nI'm
  presenting it tomorrow.\r\nShoot! "

  body: Your use of the words "aim" and "shoot" only came after I'd already seen a
    target. Is there a specific reason for this graphic?

  body: Your justification for the "target" or concentric rings would be appreciated.
    The mark is strong but could be viewed as too close to Target Corporations logo.
    The mark also seems to heavy for the text, I'd lighten it up more space between
    rings or possibly more rings. Again, this is where your justification for the
    symbol would be helpful.

  body: concept aside for a second, it first strikes you as a little heavy. like D.
    Wiewauters i think it fits your brief nicely, well chosen type. i like the weight
    on the type on the right, but somehow the actual graphic should appear lighter
    so that the text is a natural extension of the graphic. would love to see a next
    version

  body: Part of the problem with abstract designs is the average person will try to
    make the symbol into something they have related to in the past. The early remarks,
    like target, and dart board are valid. You might want to go a different direction
    rethink the concept. Sometimes I hook onto an idea and fight with it, put it away,
    and when I come back to it later realize I was forcing the issue. You might be
    forcing the issue. My advice is to put it away and revisit it after a long walk.

    associate certain shapes, signs, etc., with things on a daily basis. It is being

    us learn about it. No?

    still a young designer in the middle of exploration. Currently I'm developing
    their visual identity, which spans a lot more than the logo. When the puzzle starts
    adding up I might post some samples.\r\nI agree the logo could be stronger, but
    keep in mind the extremely low quality and conservative symbolism of similar identities.
    \r\n\r\nIn the church the logo is used as:\r\n\r\n1: A small mono symbol in the
    lower right corner, or centered at the bottom.\r\n\r\n2: A large filled decorative
    shape. (Images, ink drawings, metallic inks, colours)."
