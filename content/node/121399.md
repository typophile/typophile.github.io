  \"Cognac\" and the script font at top.  I found some similarities with Gazzette,
  but the font used in the logo is more extended. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hennytypophile2

  body: "Sounds probably \"lazy\" but to me a slightly edited [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/times-new-roman|Times
    New Roman]] might work for 'Hennessy' and 'COGNAC' mainly squooshing it and curving
    top /n serif. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/starling|Starling]] FB
    might be a good option to consider too.\r\nNo match for the script. Some close:

  body: "URW\u2019s Danmark is actually a pretty good match for the overall letter
    shapes/proportions\u2014with a little manual condensing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/danmark/\r\n\r\nThicken
    the crossbar and refine the serifs on the |H|, add serifs to each |s|, and add
    a ball finial to the tail of the |y|, and you are pretty close.\r\n\r\nAgree with
    Ryuk about Times New Roman for |COGNAC|\u2014a little artificial widening, and
    it is a better than 95% match.\r\n\r\nNimbus Roman by URW is a close second:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman/\r\n\r\nFor
    the script face, Ballantines Script by Elsner+Flake is good for everything except
    the initial caps:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/\r\n\r\nNovia
    isn\u2019t bad, either:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/novia/"
