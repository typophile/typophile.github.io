  company re-branding.\r\n\r\nCurrently we're using \"Dotty Love Graphic Design\",
  We decided to re-branding it because of few reasons..\r\nthe first one, this has
  name actually been used for around two years..  i do have a logo with light magenta\r\nand
  a love vector in it, but unfortunately,  the logo can be no longer use it as It
  appear in a drama\r\nseries in Taiwan. I'm quite upset with this. i've no idea how
  they get it.. \r\n\r\nthe second one is, i'm trying to pursue my design n printing
  services to some industry company, \r\nthe company name with \"Love\" doesn't sound
  profession enough, it's more to freelance market instead of industry.\r\n\r\nMy
  new company name is D&i Print Creation. The meaning of D&i is the short form of
  Dot & Idea, target audience\r\nis to young adult,  we provide design, print and
  photography services. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_1_72_5851.jpg]"

    one could work.\r\nThen put the text next to it and make them work together and
    stand alone.\r\nAlso you could want a black and white version."

    you have the custom 'i', you have the modified 'd', you have the bold ampersand.\r\n\r\nYou
    need to pare that down a bit. Focus on just one (or maybe two) of those components. "

  body: It terms of a clear mark, the very last pink option with the clear D&i (minus
    the 'speech bubble and colour wheels graphic') works best for me. At the least
    it would be a clear, distinctive mark.

    them. Simplifying your characters will also be great. But I like the colored petals
    with the drop inside.\r\n"

  body: "Maybe a common comment would help: <strong>start with a black/white logo
    and when that's done, move on to colour</strong>. This will help you big time
    to progress faster and clean out your logo. It's too busy, styles too different
    but promising.\r\n\r\nIf I was you, I'd go with evolution. If you've already established
    your brand with your clients it may not be too good to completely go off. Your
    existing logo isn't too bad apart from type. So that would be my starting point.
    I'd keep the heart stuff but completely change surrounding type. Including the
    new name.\r\n\r\nThis way existing clients wouldn't have problems relating new
    stuff to old (so brand keeps what it had created in their heads) and new clients
    would recognise it better."
