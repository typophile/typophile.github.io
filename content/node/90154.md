  body: I like the middle one most, the rightmost is acceptable too, the left most
    is bulky and don't even follow how medial heh is written (the middle one is very
    common in handwriting as well as calligraphy, but the rightmost is Naskhi form).

  body: "I think I should give explanations. I am not a fan of opening counters and
    loops. I find very often the black knot of Ain much more legible than the opened
    one. That's the flavour of Arabic script. But some designs demand more regular
    gray pattern.\r\n\r\nAs I am not a native speaker, I am framed by things I have
    seen and learned. So in some cases, to go forward, there is no other way but formulate
    hypothesis. So I put here that the initial/incoming and the second strokes of
    Heh are of the same origin:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4755.jpg]\r\nBecause
    there are numerous open variants of the Letter, I supposed it was possible to
    shorten the incoming stroke, removing the black area while still having two ears
    of Heh. Now I am sure, that changing the shape was a wrong way. But what do you
    think of this approach as shown below?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4361.jpg]\r\n(Scherezade;

  body: 'I don''t think this works, Marcin -- your modified Scheherazade on the right
    -- because the effect seems to be of a letter sloppily written rather than a new
    form. In the traditional open form (centre in your original image) the construction
    is clearly different from the closed form: the pen moves downwards from the horizontal
    instead of making a reversal. Your form looks like someone has tried to make the
    closed form but hasn''t quite carried the stroke far enough.'

    it a search for regularity?"

    simplified arabic, in the past typewriters couldn't handle all of arabic forms
    in a single keyboard, so linotype AFAIK created yakout to reduce number of glyphs.
    so initial and medial forms in most cases are same, this also happens in most
    of final and isolated form. this tradition is continuing until now but I don't
    know the reason, because there is no such limitations in opentype.\r\n\r\nBahman"

    an open medial haa, but in Thuluth there are the two faces: open and closed, &
    more.\r\nWhen I saw that the examples you have made an acceptable condition is
    that the chosen  shape for haa is harmonious with the rest of the letters, and
    this means that we shy away from the Traditional Naskh and we are creating a font
    recently with different specifications.\r\nThis font may be derived from the traditional

  body: "Bahman, while it is true that most letters in the Simplified Arabic scheme
    shared initial/medial and isolated/final forms, this was not the case with <em>heh,</em>
    which was an exception to that practice in Yakout. You can confirm this if you
    enter  \u0647 \u0647\u0647\u0647 in the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/yakout-2/\">Yakout
    text sample on Myfonts</a>.\r\n\r\nThe fonts I have seen in which the medial <em>heh</em>
    takes the shape of the initial tend to be fairly recent designs, and it seems
    to be a stylistic decision rather than a technical solution \xE0 la Simplified
    Arabic. Some examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hibastudio/hasan-hiba/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hakim-ghazali/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/isra/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sultan-nahia/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/firas/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/insan/\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    several of these were winners in the Linotype Arabic type design competition,
    and produced around the same time but by different people.\r\n"

    a result of the increasing Arab desire to be \"modern\".\r\n\r\nAnd interestingly,

    for example, such word as \"Isfahan\", handwritten in Nasta'liq with bulky Heh,
    gets some kind of a boost - an additional, eclectic, vernacular  flavour . So,
    probably as with other ideas, that would do some work in custom lettering rather
    than in a typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you for explanation about the initial/medial

    decision also relates to that fact that making simplified arabic is much less
    time consuming and more convenient for the designer,  not because number of designed
    glyphs are reduced, also in this style the designer doesn't have to match connecting
    parts of every glyphs with each other, baseline becomes straight and you don't
    have to worry about \"oh I don't know if the connection between \"gaf\" and  \"jim\"
    would be good but   \"jim\" wouldn't match with other glyphs like \"ra\" and so
    on\". cursive baseline needs a lot of effort. I saw new designs of cursive baseline
    that the baseline is not harmonized through the glyphs so when you are reading
    a text it's like you are surfing on a stormy ocean, moving up and down."
