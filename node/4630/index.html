  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, everyone. This is my first post, but  <BR>I thought I would kick off with something  <BR>that I'm sure everyone has an opinion on.  <BR>I'm investgating type spaces for my MA, in <BR>particular the idea that longer lines of <BR>type need a bigger wordspace. Erik Spiekermann <BR>advances this idea in 'Stop Stealing Sheep',  <BR>but doesn't really give a reason to back it  <BR>up. I feel as if it ought to be true, and can <BR>see it on a visceral level, but I wondered <BR>if anyone had any empirical evidence or  <BR>reasons to support</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">There are so many variables involved, I don't think it's possible to isolate one. If you were to conduct a thoroughly empirical experiment, you would vary word space against each of these in multiple combinations: <BR> <BR>-line length <BR>-type size <BR>-type style  <BR>-type face <BR>-type weight <BR>-tracking (letterspacing) <BR>-leading <BR>-word length <BR>-language <BR>-ink color/paper stock <BR> <BR>and that's just in the type specs. You would also have to vary text, and readers' age, education, sex, etc.,, and the reading environment, if you wanted to come up with a legitimate general principle. <BR> <BR>You could however focus on a specific relationship. One that concerns me as a type designer is the amount of contiguous white space in glyphs: for instance, consider a word ending in &quot;t&quot; and the following space: the &quot;t&quot; in Helvetica has two protusions on the right, the &quot;t&quot; in Futura just one. how does this affect the size of the following word space? The experiment would involve designing a typeface with alternate versions of the t, and seeing how that effected word space. Another thing to vary is the amount of protrusion of the crossbar in f, and t, and the arm in &quot;r&quot;. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nick, <BR>you read my mind. I'm in the process of designing <BR>some sort of visual demonstration of typographic  <BR>variables, comparing one against the other. I was <BR>sticking to line length, wordspace, global letter- <BR>spacing (tracking) and type size, although now <BR>you mention ink colour and paper stock, I wonder <BR>if I can integrate that. Hum. <BR> <BR>You mention word length, which is interesting.  <BR>I was assuming, because a word is usually <BR>bigger than a wordspace, that as the length of  <BR>a line increases, the amount of printed area  <BR>in the line increases more quickly than the  <BR>unprinted area, and this is why the wordspace <BR>should be increased. But this is a very  <BR>tentative supposition, and I've been trying <BR>fruitlessly to prove it to myself mathematically. <BR>I think I might be on a fool's errand &hellip; <BR> <BR>The wordspace in relation to specific glyphs <BR>is also something I've been thinking about in <BR>a very fuzzy way. I tend to see it in relation <BR>to the end of one sentence and a following <BR>sentence starting with &quot;T&quot;, which is pretty  <BR>common. Sometimes it can get quite gappy, <BR>depending on the font.   <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your help, you've made me  <BR>think about the problem differently. I was <BR>getting pretty blinkered. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

For example, increasing word space in longer lines may help evenness of color, an aesthetic consideration, but may harm readability, which is influenced by consistency of rhythm of the letters and spaces. <BR> <BR>In 'The Finer Points in Spacing' Dowding gives convincing examples of where excessive word spacing hurts readability, because the eye doesn't hold to the line of text as easily. On the other hand, his own word spaces to my eye are so pinched that they make reading more difficult.  <BR> <BR>Good luck on your research &amp; do post your results!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alex, this is indeed a great topic. <BR> <BR>Patterson and Tinker did a lot of solid empirical research in the 50s and 60s, but I don't remember anything specific about word spaces (you might check). As Nick says, the massive inter-relation of variables is very daunting. And I agree with William too: I have my doubts about making word spaces longer in proportion to line length. It might actually do more harm, not just in the way William notes, but also because the longer the line the more you depend on the leading to find your way back to the beginning of the next line, and bigger word spaces make that harder. Lastly, the more horizontal room a line takes the slower the reading. <BR> <BR>If Spiekermann would give a reason, we could analyze it - maybe there's something I'm missing? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Hrant, <BR> <BR>thanks for the Patterson Tinker information, I'll  <BR>go and have a look at that. As for the wordspace/ <BR>line length conundrum, maybe I'm looking at it in <BR>the wrong way. Perhaps it's more helpful to see it <BR>as shorter lines having smaller wordspaces. I can  <BR>see how this might be the case on a newspaper, <BR>for example, where short lines with minimal  <BR>leading necessitate tighter horizontal spacing to <BR>maintain a more coherent horizontality. Whether  <BR>there's more to it than economic necessity though, <BR>I don't know. <BR> <BR>I can't help wondering if Erik Spiekermann's  <BR>position is one of principle rather than  <BR>practicality. Having said that, when I look at  <BR>the end of my previous post and compare it to  <BR>the longer lines of your post, my post seems more  <BR>gappy.

		<div class="commentbody">It recently occurred to me that there is another factor involved in word spacing: kerning. <BR> <BR>When you have a word starting with a &quot;needs kerning&quot; combination of characters, it requires a certain amount of word-space preceding it, in order that the first letter doesn't look like a single word. This is particularly apparent for the nasties: T,V,W and Y followed by a round lowercase letter. <BR> <BR>Hence the huge spacing in 19thC typography. <BR> <BR>In a tightly fitted and kerned face, you can even put kerning between the space character and letters such as A,T,W,W,Y, and period and comma.</div>
