body: If it even exists, has anyone figured out how in FontLab to lock down the tool
  bars at the top and keep them from inadvertently converting to floating boxes because
  of an erroneous click of the mouse? And STILL have the buttons be clickable?

    often. Then you can save it as your workspace(s), and use them later anytime you
    want.\r\n\r\nTools > Customize > Drag-and-Drop the commands you wish to have on

  body: "Thanks for the response. I already have done what you've suggested and in
    fact have a pretty extensive workspace ... meaning, I probably have 40 tools/commands
    represented by various personally-created small icons on my toolbars/panels docked
    at the top of my window in two rows.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering is, if there's
    a way to prevent those toolbars/panels from being \"undocked\" and converted into
    floating boxes because I've reached for something at the top of the glyph window
    and clicked a centimeter or two above it. Every time I do that, my two toolbars
    either combine into one (hiding one, in effect), or the bottom toolbar is moved
    and becomes a square version inside the glyph window itself. It can be rather
    annoying."

  body: You're using the mouse to select tools? I find it's much more efficient to
    use the keyboard shortcuts. Most of the tools have single keys assigned to them
    (1 for the select tool, 3 for knife tool, 5 for the corner tool, etc.). For the
    ones that don't, you can assign them yourself.
