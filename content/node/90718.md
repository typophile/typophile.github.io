  height=\"800\" width=\"378\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDavid Hebrew may seem like old news:
  it happens to be one of the most ubiquitous Hebrew fonts. Everyone has David Hebrew
  in some form or another installed on their computer (David on Windows, Raanana on
  Macs). In my recent book <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Book-Jackets-of-Ismar-David/162614020459110\">The
  Book Jackets of Ismar David</a> I touched on what made David Hebrew so popular:\r\n\r\n\"Scarcity
  of good quality Hebrew type compelled David to embark on his quest to create a new
  typeface. His work began in 1937, and culminated in the 1954 release of David Hebrew
  by Intertype Corporation in Brooklyn, N.Y. David\u2019s groundbreaking design was
  not a revival of an existing type, but was inspired by historic calligraphic hands,
  distilled to their purest expression. David Hebrew went on to become one of today's
  most popular Hebrew typefaces and may well be considered Ismar David's most recognized
  legacy in design. Its success may be attributed to the innovative design approach,
  but more likely it is due to its clarity, grace, and exceptional beauty.\"\r\n\r\nWhile
  all existing versions of digital David Hebrew are at best lookalikes of the original
  design, <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?kid=david+hadash#products\">David
  Hadash\u2122</a>  (Hadash means \"new\" in Hebrew) offers a faithful digitization
  of the original drawings, preserving the subtlety and better letterfit of the metal
  type design, subsequently lost in multiple generations of redrawing for new typesetting
  systems. This type is for the first time issued as a complete type family envisioned
  by the designer in the early 1930s, but never fully realized until today. It includes
  upright (called Formal), cursive (called Script) and monoline (called Sans), each
  in three weights, as well as extended character set for the upright (called Biblical),
  including a full set of cantillation marks (te'amim).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted
  that the cursive (first issued in one weight by Intertype in 1950s) was the first
  true cursive Hebrew type of the 20th c. The never-before issued sans is noteworthy
  as one of the very few \"humanistic\" Hebrew sans types, closely following the classical
  proportions of the upright \"serif\" design. \r\n\r\nDespite having been designed
  over half a century years ago, the appearance of this long-awaited family today
  is remarkably fresh.\r\n\r\nUpd: See the official announcement <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/RecentReleases/2012/DavidHadash.htm\">here</a>."

      has added a set of custom Latin glyphs to this font, although something tells
      me Ismar David would not consider them a perfect match, had he been alive. Here
      is one way to combine David Hebrew with a Latin font designed by David himself.

    fonts that incline to the right always gives me a pain in the eyes."

    me to quote myself from\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/90093 :\r\n\r\n\"\r\nYou
    know, for the longest time I thought right-leaning\r\nItalics were not... kosher
    :-) for Hebrew. For one thing\r\nthey're totally not in its sister-script, Arabic.
    I think\r\nI simply didn't want to believe it's OK (being an anti-\r\nLatinization
    myrmidon) and I dismissed the various\r\nexamples of it (like the El-Al logo*,
    if memory serves)\r\nas deluded. But I'm not sure any more, and if I were to\r\nbet
    the house (not that I'm a gambler) I think these days\r\nI'd put my money on \"it's
    OK\". Maybe since Israelis are\r\nvery tech-oriented they've moved even further
    from\r\nhandwriting than Westerners.\r\n\r\n* Although airplane directionality\r\nprovides
    an extra twist there.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn fact Oded is probably the main person\r\nwho
    made me stop thinking it's a problem:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/oded_ezer/5584987088/\r\nOn

  body: "Many Israelis write cursive with a 'backhand' slant. It comes naturally from
    using the right hand in the same way that artists slant their lines and do hatching
    using the right hand. Conversely Leonardo with his left hand slanted his drawing
    and handwriting the other way.\r\n\r\nAs an artist I sometimes take a drawing
    say in charcoal and place it face downwards and then rub on the back to transfer
    the image onto another paper or a canvas. It comes out slanted in the opposite
    way and therefore can be fresh to the eye.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived in Israel (in the
    70s) I wrote Hebrew with a forehand slant as it appealed to me aesthetically.
    I liked the font Guttman Adii which slopes that way. This font does not seem to
    be readily available today.\r\n\r\nHere are my conclusions:\r\na) The default
    (if no one cares) is to have the slanted font 'backhand' - bottom left to top
    right.\r\nb) Designing a font for widespread common use, have the slant 'backhand'.\r\nb)
    Designing a font that is intended to be special or and for uncommon usage have
    the slant that is aesthetically appealing with that particular font design.\r\n(In
    the case of my font Shuneet that will be 'forehand').\r\n\r\nMike\r\n"
