  Titillium, that had still aliasing and pixellation, because of hinting and rasterization
  absence, did you remember?\r\n\r\nThen I was building the fonts at FontForge 2.0
  from Ubuntu 10.10. When I finished one font. I installed it on Windows 7 and Ubuntu
  fonts folders. I opened the font for viewing it, but I got surprised and disappointed
  with that... because my font is still aliasing and pixelatted. I didn't find how
  I better and optimize the antialiasing, hinting and rasterization of the fonts at
  FontForge and, other fonts editores... I couldn't try to correct the deffects of
  the letters and better the high quality. \r\n\r\nIf you don't understand me, remember
  of Verdana that has excellent antialiasing, hinting and rasterization. \r\n\r\nBit
  I don't know how, how will I make for bettering the fony? Do you know some tutorial
  which can help me?\r\n\r\n\"Optimize\"  means improve and enhace.\r\n\r\nMaybe Frode
  Frank know it, because Frode Frank explained very well about ClearType, hinting
  and antialiasing. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nKevin"

    most of it is about VTT, Microsoft\u2019s (Windows-only) hinting tool. If you
    have lots and lots of free time you could probably teach yourself to hint fonts
    and get good at it, but that also goes for things like being a professional pianist.\r\n\r\n<cite>If

    engineering product created by masters of the craft to look great on screen."
