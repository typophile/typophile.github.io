  with regards to commission, but I haven't been successful. I know dafont markets
  fonts on the back-end of having advertising sponsors, but do they offer a paid commission
  to the type designers submissions or is it all purely for free? Also, which would
  you say are the top 6 - 7 foundries to start building your collections within, I'm
  already with myfonts.com, and have a lot of new more developed faces to put out
  into the market,\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\nAlex."

    see <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001157.php\">Typographica</a>]</strong>\r\n\r\nHi
    Alex. It's funny you should ask, because we just discussed this in a panel at
    [[TypeCon]] on Saturday. I didn't get to say a lot of what I wanted to say in
    that session, so I'll let it all spill out here. I welcome any rebuttals or filling
    of holes. Disclaimer: the information below comes from 10 years of experience
    examining the retail font industry and is intended to be unbiased, but my perspective
    is inevitably shaped by four years as an employee of FontShop.\r\n\r\nIt's important
    to understand the difference between a [[Foundries|foundry]] (AKA vendor or publisher)
    and a [[font retailers|reseller]] (AKA distributor or retailer). If you are a
    font maker, here are your options for getting that font to the public and making
    some money:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Signing with a Foundry</strong>\r\nA foundry can
    be considered a product manufacturer such as [[Monotype]], [[P22]], or [[FontFont]].
    Foundries can be distributed through multiple channels, such as their own web
    shop and the shops of their resellers. When you submit a typeface to a foundry
    for release it is usually an exclusive deal. They will maintain the right to sell
    the font according to their contract. Royalties range from 20%-50% but there is
    also an important distinction: most foundries pay a percentage of the wholesale
    price of the font. So as the font goes further down the distribution chain, the
    designer is getting less of the retail price. Other foundries, like FontFont,
    give a percentage of the suggested retail price. So no matter where the font is
    sold, the designer gets the same cut.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Advantages:</dt> <dd>The
    foundry will handle all customer support (big!), marketing, and reseller contract
    relationships. Some offer technical and design assistance to complete font production.
    Spend less time on business, more on drawing and designing fonts.</dd>\r\n<dt>Disadvantages:
    </dt><dd>Less control of where your font is sold. Earn less from each sale.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<strong>2.
    Signing with a Reseller</strong>\r\nA reseller offers fonts from multiple foundries.
    Examples are [[Fonts.com]], [[MyFonts]], [[Veer]], and [[FontShop]]. Resellers
    usually sign contracts with a foundry/publisher (in your case, Thinkdust) and
    offer all the fonts in that foundry's library. Resellers usually give the foundry
    between 50-65% of the retail price of the font. Each reseller has a different
    clientele and produces different types and quantities of marketing. I could go
    into the major differences later if you like. Some independent foundries (like
    [[Shinntype]] and [[Mark Simonson]]) find best results by offering their fonts
    through many different resellers while others go for a more exclusive strategy
    (like [[Porchez Typofonderie]] at FontShop, [[Jukebox]] at [[Veer]]). In the latter
    case, the reseller will often give a foundry more promotion exchange for being
    an exclusive retailer.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Advantages: </dt><dd>Reach far more customers
    and different markets. Maintain some control of brand, pricing, and the ability
    to sign with multiple resellers.</dd>\r\n<dt>Disadvantages: </dt><dd>Must be somewhat
    business savvy. Earn less from each sale.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Going it
    Alone</strong>\r\nBuilding a foundry and selling them exclusively on your own
    web shop gives you 100% of sales, of course. Exclusivity has its benefits, as
    [[Hoefler & Frere-Jones]] and [[Lineto]] will attest.  It can give your brand
    a certain boost in value. But unless you are already well known, it can be a lot
    of very hard work to get customers to your shopfront, while lesser fonts are benefitting
    from broader exposure and marketing.\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Advantages: </dt><dd>Full
    control of brand and pricing. Get 100% of sales.\r\n<dt>Disadvantages: </dt><dd>Labor
    intensive. Must be business savvy. Less time for making fonts. Potential for major
    overhead. Responsible for customer support (major resource draw).</dd></dl>\r\n\r\nSo
    the first decision to be made with each of your typefaces is whether you want
    to go the foundry or reseller route. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to submit to a foundry,
    <em>the question of royalty rate is only one of many.</em> Which foundry would
    be the best fit for the typeface design? What foundries do you respect? Where
    are they sold and how are they marketed? What production assistance do they offer?
    How many fonts are already in their library?\r\n\r\nIf you choose to build your
    own foundry, decide whether you want to sell the fonts exclusively on your own,
    or through one or more resellers. Again, which resellers do you respect? Who is
    their clientele and what do they offer in the form of marketing and other tools
    and services to draw customers? How many foundries are already in their shop?\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Dafont.com is simply a free font archive. Any commercial fonts listed on their
    site link to fonts.com and the publisher of Dafont.com gets an affiliate commission.
    The site is not a foundry or reseller in any way.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. The reason I ask, is that I am currently
    at the start of setting up an online type foundry with Paris company Hello Hikimori.
    The company is going to be called 'Hypefortype.com) and I'm just researching into
    the field in detail. I realise marketing and driving traffic is a difficult thing
    on a very large scale, so would you have any recommendations here. We're going
    to have two different sections of type. One is corporate which hopefully will
    be snapped up by agencies, and the other is creative. What would you say was the
    best savvy business decision in order to make this a successful?\r\n\r\nI have
    a friend in London who is friends with Identikal, a pair of designers who have
    been extremely successful from type design apparently. So I was wondering what
    kind of promotion and marketing occurs, and whether it's best to submit to resellers
    also?\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any comments from anyone, and thanks for your help
    above Stephen,\r\nAlex."

    you a useful recommendation. Also, how much time are you willing to spend on marketing,
    customer support, and financial tasks? Are you willing to sacrifice a portion
    of your sales to be relieved of some of that work?\r\n\r\n> So I was wondering
    what kind of promotion and marketing occurs\r\n\r\nExamples: web marketing (a
    useful website, web ads, SEO, backlinks), print marketing (magazine ads, catalogs,
    reference material, mailers), PR, build a customer database, create convincing
    type samples and copy, get active in the type community, develop relationships
    with designers and agencies."
