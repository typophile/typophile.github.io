  New Monochrome Graphics\u201D from viction:ary (http://victionary.com/product/p01-bw/)
  and I loved this font they used on some quotes and all the paragraph texts which
  in my head looks a bit like Rockwell but an stencil version. \r\n\r\nI've seen online
  a few slab serif fonts but they are not as nice as this one. Does anyone know which
  font is this one? I took a very bad picture at the book store and found a few more
  online from the book.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!"
