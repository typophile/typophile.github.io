  body: "> <em>Please tell me it\u2019s free!</em>\r\n\r\nWhy, for crying out loud?
    You say yourself it's a lovely font, so you aknowledge the fact that it's an interesting
    and well-executed type design. This means somebody has put some serious thought
    and a lot of time and effort into producing this font. So why should all this
    creativity and hard work be worth nothing? This kind of reasoning makes <em>absolutely
    no sense.</em> I mean, think about it."

  body: "Wow... thanks for the ultra ultra quick ident.\r\n\r\nSorry, didn't mean
    to cause offence by the \"hope it's free\" remark. That doesn't mean I don't value
    the work of typographers such as yourself (i'm assuming)... in fact I'm quite
    fascinated by the works behind it and would like to read more about where people
    start with a typeface.\r\n\r\nAll I'm saying in my that comment is that I'm absolutely
    skint at the moment - and if on my journey to the bakery, someone offers me a
    free loaf of freshly baked bread, it'd be like all my brithdays had come at once
    (okay that's eggagerated but you get the idea)!"

  body: "Whoops, I came across a lot more aggressive than I intended to be. Sorry'boutthat.\r\n\r\nI
    understand the fact that you're skint, but seriously -- how often did you get
    offered a free loaf of bread on your way to the bakery? Seriously? :^P\r\n\r\nAnd
    although I <em>am</em> a typographer, I don't design type myself. There's a distinction
    between \"typographer\" who uses type and \"type designer\" who designs type.
    One can be both of course. ;^)"
