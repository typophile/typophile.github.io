One thing is clear, if we do nothing now, there will be nothing to judge in the future.  Only the most arrogant among us can pretend they know what future generations will cherish.  After all, we can't (thank heaven) even agree among ourselves now on what is wheat and what is chaff.

		<div class="commentbody">I greatly admire innovative work in type design, including Nick's, but I do not think his - your - view  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on this is quite right in the case of type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For computers, better ones have made past ones more or less obsolete.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a general rule, there is no point in using the last generation of computers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With type, I think the analogy is more to architecture than computers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I live in the Washington DC area, and two of the best monumental buildings in the area are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lincoln memorial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dulles Airport<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lincoln Memorial is more or less a copy of a Greek temple, with the fabulous statue of Lincoln in the middle.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dulles, designed by Eero Saarinan, is an icon of modern design, with its sweeping wing-like roof. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was it a mistake to copy an Greek temple in the late 19th century?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, because of the resonance with ancient ideals of democracy, and what Lincoln stood for in extending these ideals to all Americans.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also by simply doing a copy, they didn't mess it up, but got a fabulous result. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Saarinen's design was very much of its time, but when it came to expanding it a few years ago, they just doubled the length, not changing anything.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact this was the original design, and Saarinen had adjusted the design so that only half could be built first.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was it stupid to simply build a 60's design in 2000? I don't think so.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It works beautifully. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now it would have been stupid in the '60s to build an airport as a Greek temple.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Having a modern building was appropriate and worked well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> But expanding it in the 60s style - the only smart thing to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think these examples illustrate that what is appropriate in design and use in relation to history is a complicated matter,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and that newer is not necessarily better.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a place for historical revivals, and they are sometimes better than the contemporary  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- and sometimes not.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I may be wrong but I detect in Nick's arguments some buying into Hegel's idea of the 'zeitgeist', the spirit of the times.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, fashions are a reality, but what Hegel is claiming is that some are superior, the 'wave of the future',  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and that everything that doesn't go along with the Zeitgeist is backward.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The same type of thinking goes is in the somewhat different idea that there is an 'avant garde',  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and everything else done is more or less stale and worthless.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fashion is exciting in itself, and I have nothing against it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But most fashions go stale and a few turn out to be lasting.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because something is innovative doesn't mean it is necessarily good or most appropriate for every project and setting.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In many cases old and good is better even than new and good.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And of course the other way around is also often true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A new design that is good is a greater personal achievement for the designer,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but it is not necessarily better than an old design, even for contemporary works.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think new, excellent work that that done by some who post on this board, including Nick, is exciting and wonderful to have and use.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that doesn't mean that less innovative work is less useful or appropriate in many, if not most, contexts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. You know very well that I wasn't being profound. And yet you had to go for the easy smart remark. Oh well. I was simply trying to point out that I was thankful for the variety, new and old. It would be financially impossible to license all of the type to which I really would like to have access. I would hope that type designers today would want to improve or at least work toward an ideal improvement of their own thinking. Why design type if you aren't trying to improve? But, I don't think that you should throw out the old simply because there is new. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because something is innovative doesn't mean it is necessarily good or most appropriate for every project and setting.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In many cases old and good is better even than new and good.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And of course the other way around is also often true.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amen.

		<div class="commentbody">These issues go all over the map. Obviously there is need for &quot;good book faces&quot;, old, or new. We have an abundance of the rest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still the real question remains. What makes for good book design? Is it as Nick suggests, type decision, and type decision only. Otherwise he asks, &quot;why not use default grids?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(not exact wording, to lazy to find the archives) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clearly questionable logic. One (1) good book face is more important than quantity. The work of Aldus Manutius demonstrates not only one (1) good book face, and take further note, in one (1) point size only. Aldus Manutius is a name you should all know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A good book designer can certainly produce beautiful books with &quot;a single type face for their entire working career.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I say to &quot;those that disbelieve&quot; that they know nothing of the history of book design. In fact, contrary to arguments type designers offer, just examine the plethora of typographical book design failures in spite of &quot;accidental good type face decisions&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type face choice is an important ingredient in book design, as is paper, paper size, colours, margins, illustrations, text page to sheet size ratios, point size, spacing, line length, table of contents, character count, binding etc. etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Easily comparable to cooking. Without quality ingredients it is impossible to make the finest of foods. However, that said, &quot;a bad chef&quot; can not make a culinary masterpiece from the finest of ingredients.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;cook for the book&quot; is the designer, not the ink saleman, type salesman or the &quot;green grocer&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember what your mothers said, &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type design is not the Eiffle Tower of typography. What is so badly needed in the type manufacturing industry is a broader appreciation and understanding of the industry at large. Navel gazing should be kept to a minimum. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;type designers and manufacturers of 90,000 digital fonts doe not dictate taste&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Good taste&quot; is a sophistication of refinements.

		<div class="commentbody">IMO, it's not the typeface, it's the designer who causes mischief. For every well designed book that makes the AIGA, there are scores of difficult to read solutions being OK'd by editors and publishers who should know better. If I may do so without sounding contentious, I would take exception to the comment above concerning typefaces in use in CH and D in the 50s and 60s. I was there, and I assure you that the Swiss, all over their well-ordered country, set plenty of Times New Roman better than we were doing in the USA. Ditto for Baskerville, Bodoni, Clarendon, and the lovely Diethelm, which we did not have. The output of even the smallest regional newspaper and job shop was far superior to our larger shops. Furthermore, they did it all with a dozen or so faces compared to our hundreds, most of which were just as mindless in metal as the digital of today. FWIW</div>
