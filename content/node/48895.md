body: "Does anyone know of a typeface that fits this description? This seems like
  an easy find but I've had trouble finding many typefaces that meet these qualifications.
  I've been using Engravers Gothic BT in small caps which works pretty well, but I'm
  looking for something that's a bit more extreme. I don't think that I want an expanded
  face, since they tend to look too stretched. But something clean, short and wide
  would be perfect.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has any ideas, please throw them out there.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    wasn't looking for stainless by name but it was the Typeface used by 'Source Magazine'
    a few years ago for all their Heading Styles.\r\n\r\nThanks,"
