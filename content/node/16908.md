  body: "Interesting hand-illustrated cover originally designed for 1973 release of
    <em>Birds of Fire</em>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mahavish_logo.gif]\r\nThe
    whole cover seems to have the look of a transparent watercolor with Primacolor
    pencil added. If you look closely at the letters, they seemed to have been traced
    and colored from a source typeface but modified. A model for MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA
    could have been Hobo with lumpy serifs added on the fly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maha_hobo.png]\r\n\r\n\"Birds
    of Fire\" is also part of the cover painting and has the same feeling of a typeface
    that was used as a model for loosely copying or tracing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Maha_cover.gif]\r\nRemember,
    this was designed in 1973 or earlier, so the faces may have been loosely traced
    from press-type or phototypesetting. Both ITC Bookman and Cooper Black had very
    similar swash characters to the \"f\" and \"r\" available in photo headliners."

    body: "Hey there all,\r\n\r\nWell, you're gonna get it straight from the horses
      mouth, I'm just flattered that after all these years there seems to be more
      interest in my work than way back when. I guess that's just the way it goes.
      \r\n\r\nThere are some very astute observations about how I designed this font,
      Hobo, Windsor and Bookman were some of the influences. Although, I really tried
      to put some subtle changes into it. Norbert, yes, Hobo was a strong influence,
      and the \"lumpy serifs\" were my principle contribution! Funny, since I always
      then and now hated Hobo.\r\n\r\nThis was designed in late 1972 as I recall,
      I was in the same spiritual movement as John, and actually lived in his home
      as a renter for about 3 years. \r\n\r\nI was a very young designer at the time,
      about 22, and I was most concerned with designing something that the Mashavishnu
      brand could own, so that was why I designed it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I never
      finished the whole alphabet, much to my regret, and still would like to finish
      it today. Although I still have no idea how to use any of the font creation
      programs, so feel free to chime in.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, this past year I
      was approached over the internet by Walter Kowlosky, a Boston writer who is
      putting together a great book on the MO, and I was privilidged to do the cover
      design for it. \r\n\r\nSo anyway, if any of you want to discuss this or see
      what I'm doing now, I can be reached at poissonsaz@qwest.net."

  body: "With \"on the fly\" (an old expression), I meant 'as you go along' or spur
    of the moment thinking or creativeness.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are only guesses of
    mine, and the source material for the album cover may have been different or just
    invented. But the similarities to type designs that were prominently available
    during the early 70s can't be denied.\r\n\r\nBut if you are asking if the lettering
    was hand drawn, my assessment would be yes, but copied and modified from existing
    type designs."

    and did something kind of in the same vein with my present website logo. I applied
    the \"noise\" filter 40 times, and as it's random (or more random than most Photoshop
    filters, IYKWIM), the results are all different, and these comprise the frames,
    cycled. Being a McLaughlin fan from way back, I spent a lot of time looking at
    the album covers and listening to the music in vartious mental states, so Chris'
    atomism may be responsible for this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/STf.gif]"

    on. My younger brother played a couple of gigs with John McLaughlin around the
    time Carlos Santana jammed with John... incredible stuff.\r\n\r\nJust goes to
    show the rest of us that something done well (or with love) is ALWAYS worth remembering.\r\n\r\n(Gee,
    I hope nobody uncovers the oil company logo I developed using a very distressed
    Stymie Bold.)\r\n\r\nGood luck landing the MO book project. Stay in touch, let
    us know if it happens, or just hang around and reminisce with us older coots."

  body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nFWIW, Birds of Fire was a pen drawing, I was into printing
    at the time as well, so I used 4 Rapidiograph pens with each of the 4-color process
    colors, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. That's it. I took me about a month and
    a half to draw. \r\n\r\nFunny story, CBS printed several hundred thousand on them
    on glossy stock and it looked horrible, John and I went down to their office and
    told John Berg, the executive art director they were not acceptable, So they did
    a re-print on a textured matte stock, which looked great. John Berg had a hissy
    fit when we regected the first batch, he actually kicked the wall!"

    font of Mahavishnu is being drawn by a typographer named Ray Larabie. It will
    be used in the Mahavishnu book mentioned above. To think, over 30 years after
    it was first drawn!"
