body: Have a sudden need to print out a list of all characters in a font, much like
  the glyph table in Indesign. Programs like Fontographer or Fontlab would be an overkill.
  Most freebie programs only print out "waterfall" or sample text. It is a pity that
  you can't print out of Popchar. GID/unicode would be nice but not critical. Any
  suggestions? Platform is Mac OSX. Thanks in advance.

    little program doesn't write out all <em>glyphs</em>, though. Accessing glyphs
    instead of characters is notoriously difficult, and it would indeed need a fully
    featured program such as FontLab, FontForge, or Adobe InDesign.\r\n\r\nHave you
    looked into Adobe's FDK? If not, search this forum for more info -- there's bound
    to be something in it you like."

  body: I use [[http://fntsample.sourceforge.net/|fntsample]] which generates Unicode
    charts-like font tables, but it does not include unencoded glyphs. No idea of
    you can gt it on mac, though.

  body: FonttableMW works. I have also installed AFDKO and really like the tk output.
    Will be spending more time exploring it as well as fntsample. Thanks for all your
    assistance.
