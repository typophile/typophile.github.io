<div class=commentbody>I don't remember Anselm being discussed much here or elsewhere. Has anyone used it? It is certainly an impressive type system in its coverage of sans and serif, multitude of weights, and Cyrillic and Greek scripts. It certainly seems to have aspirations of being a versatile workhorse.
What do people think of its Baroque spirit and distinctive flavour, though? As much as I admire it, I do worry it might be a bit too flashy for "serious" work. I guess you can never accuse František Štorm of being boring...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Brian,
I was glad to see Anselm on the list as well. I actually did a small writeup that hasn't been published yet, which hits all the same points about the family that you just made. Overall I feel it's a very solid type system, but definitely should be saved for occasions when appropriate and probably not suitable for everyday work (although i don't think I would mind seeing it all the time). </div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul: <cite>although i don’t think I would mind seeing [Anselm] all the time</cite>
Neither would I! Though right now, I haven't seen it in use anywhere, and I'm itching to see examples. I know, it was only released last year, but hey, I'm impatient.
In my search for Anselm in use, I ran into <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv017.cgi?read=128086">this surreal thread</a> about the font choice for labels in an open calculator project. As far as I can tell, a group of aficionados are collaborating to build a calculator, code name Phoenix. One of them has suggested Anselm (sans, I believe) for the labels, and has even contacted Franta Štorm about extending the character set as needed for a scientific calculator, and got a positive response from him.
Wow, that's one use I had not thought of.</div>

<div class=commentbody>from said surreal thread...
<cite>Given the fact, that the font is only used in a very small size, thus details (and flaws) are hardly discernable, do we judge it worthwhile to pay 45 EUR instead of using characters from free fonts? There are even font editors out there, making it possible to create our own special characters that can't be found elsewhere.</cite></div>

<div class=commentbody>Just curious about this one thing:
<cite>Where necessary, the jury was advised about non-Latin script entries by the TDC Non-Latin Advisory Board, which was for this year comprised of:</cite>
<cite>...</cite>
<cite>John Hudson</cite>
<cite>...</cite>
How does that work? I'm hoping he recused himself when it came to the category that he was entered in and subsequently won. I've heard grumblings about conflict of interest in the past. Not that I'm saying that's the situation here, but I'm just curious how this gets played out.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan, yes, I did excuse myself from the non-Latin advisory panel this year, as did Fiona Ross. We wrote to Maxim Zhukov, organiser of the advisory panel, and to Matthew Carter, the chairman, prior to the competition to let them know that neither of us were able to participate because we were submitting a design. We recommended some possible replacements. Maxim later contacted me to see if I could recommend someone qualified to take a look at entries in two scripts for which he did not have advisors (neither script Devanagari), and I gave him some names. He was unable to find anyone to review one of the entries, and asked me some questions about the design, to which I gave what I believe were impartial answers regarding its fitness to the stated purpose of the design (low res devices). I believe, although I have not seen confirmation yet, that the design was the 'OTS Ethiopic' from Monotype Imaging, for which the TDC are apparently awaiting artwork for the website.
It's unfortunate that the number of people with experience designing for certain scripts is small, but such scripts shouldn't be penalised during the judging due to lack of qualified advice.</div>

And, just for the record, I also withdraw from the NLAB when any of my students' non-Latin typeface designs are submitted - as was the case with Titus Nemeth's Nassim.
BTW I appreciate the comments re the Vodafone Hindi design.

<div class=commentbody>I've got some love for the new script fonts from Ken (Barber) at House. And for Tiina. And... And... And. How to choose. I guess if I have to choose my favorite is... nevermind, I can't. Congratulations to all!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, I think it’s my first post here. I’ve seen my name and, you know…
Unfortunately, Fondo is not for sale. It was a custom font exclusive for Fondo de Cultura Económica. It had pros and cons: as a pre-paid job I had all the tranquility to focus my efforts on this project for a year or so (and I suppose that influenced the forms), but on the other hand it was, from the beginning, only for them.
Anyway, your comments makes me keep going, since it’s my first really finished work, because the other one, Espinosa —a revival from the Mexican XVIth Century, commented in this forum long time ago— still awaiting and requires a major surgery.
Best,
CH</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mmmmh, it seems that I killed the posts with my last one. Sorry.
Just a word about James Puckett comment:
<cite>Given the type coming out of Mexico right now I think this is probably just the start of a trend.<cite>
Thanks for the comment, James. That felt good. I just wanna say that actually it’s not the first time that two Mexican are selected in the same year. It happened in 2006 —Gabriel Martínez Meave (yes, Presidencia’s author) and Alejandro Lo Celso, although Lo Celso is certainly more Argentinian than Mexican—, and in 2005 Leonardo Vázquez won with Bunker, a display face. And Martínez Meave again in 2001. Maybe the difference is that this year we had significant clients: a renowned publishing house and the Presidency of Mexico (no less).
Of course, I hope this will be repeated. ;)

<div class=commentbody>Ah, Tipos Latinos will be this April (24, 25 and 26) in Veracruz. Gabriel Martínez Meave, Alejandro Paul and myself will be there. More info (only in Spanish, sorry):
http://www.tiposlatinos.com/2008/sede.php?id=18
And it’s not pretty soon, but the 2009 Atypi conference will be in Mexico City (September or October, seems to be). Hope to see you here by then.

<div class=commentbody>!!!!
ATypI in Mexico? Are you sure? I haven't heard that yet. Wonderful! Easier to attend than St. Petersburg. I'll start planning....
I was going to suggest (again) that TypeCon be held there, but no matter. Tipos Latinos sounds marvelous but it's coming up so soon. Well, a local AND an international conference.... Have a great time, all of you attending. Who else is attending? Someone bring a report back! Hola to GMM and Ale. </div>

<div class=commentbody>ATypI in Mexico City sounds fabulous. I’m not sure if the ATypI part or the steaks cooked Mexican-style is more attractive, though ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>ATypI in Mexico? Are you sure?</em>
It was announced in Brighton, at the same time as the announcement of the St Petersburg conference. Roger Black, who has Danilo Black offices in Mexico, is one of the principal organisers, so I expect it to be a very good conference.</div>
