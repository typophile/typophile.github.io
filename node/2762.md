body: Can anyone recognize both of these fonts for me. Are they different or is the
  second an italic of the first. Thanks and sorry about the quality of the scan. <BR>

  body: Huh? It sure looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bembo/bembo/testdrive.html?s=Ultravox&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Bembo</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bembo/italic/testdrive.html?s=Lament&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Bembo Italic</a>.  <BR>LC &#34;t&#34; looks a bit different on
    the roman, but that&#39;s  <BR>maybe a difference between the Linotype and  <BR>the
    Monotype version.

  body: BTW, this is interesting... the <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000K5AU.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">
    1999 reissue of that album</a> features Times New Roman  <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t
    have it, I&#39;m telling from Amazon&#39;s image&#41;.

  body: Oh, thanks Yves. I still see some minor differences in &#39;v&#39; and &#39;x&#39;,
    but it seems to be some problem with the scan &#40;or not&#41;.

  body: Yes it&#39;s Bembo, the designer has used the font extensively for other artists.
    The scan was so bad I wasn&#39;t sure though. Thanks again.
