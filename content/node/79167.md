body: 'I am creating a guidebook for Paris, a portfolio piece, and I am wondering
  if the font Parkinson is too decorative and sharp for body text. I am focusing on
  an Art Nouveau theme, with some focus on Hector Guimard, and thought I would go
  with a serif font. Thoughts? Guidance to using Parkinson or other font recommendations? '
