  body: I guess the problem is I used to be able to copy and paste out of Photoshop,
    being bmp,tiff, or jpeg, but not this is impossible. I can only upload single
    files via drop down menus. Now if I have to I guess I could cut and paste each
    individual letter into a separate psd and then upload those, but thats not ideal...especially
    given I could do the requested with the last font I designed.

  body: "A file open in Photoshop does not have a file format; it does have color
    depth, etc. and that might be the impediment. But then you're talking about batch-uploading
    files into FontLab? I'm confused. In any case, you might take a look at ScanFont.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well scanfont i.e. more money isn't the answer...\r\n\r\nI open up a 1bit
    72dpi bmp file and select a portion on the scanned specimen, lets say for instance
    the letter \"A\". I then open up fontlab and select the \"A\" glyph. I hit paste
    and nothing occurs where as about a month ago something would be pasted into the
    background layer."

  body: Maybe this is a problem...Im on 5.1.2. When I get home I'll try it on my older
    version(same as yours I believe) and see if this works, if so then I'll just have
    to do all the background work on that machine. Its a work around, but not a fix.
    Darn you fontlab...

    checked that the mask layer isn't locked?\r\n\r\nWhat did support say? Did you
    tell them you were still stuck?"

  body: The layer isn't locked as I am able to delete the default background on a
    new font file, but still havent had any response from support via twitter. I opened
    up an older version on my old laptop 5.0.2 and it worked fine there...grayscale
    cs6 straight into fl with no problem.  Its is really frustrating because my old
    laptop is clumsy, and slow with outdated software yet...I have this. It has put
    a damper in progress, but I guess I will have to just work on both laptops unless
    something magically happens.

    is not a real route to tech support, for software in general. Try http://www.fontlab.com/contact-and-support/product-support/
    and likely from there http://www.fontlab.com/contact-and-support/product-support/problem-report/\r\n\r\nBut
    you still have not verified that the file is a 1-bit image. (B&W)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
