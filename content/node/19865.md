body: "HI All, \r\nI'm having major problems getting the Candian dictionary in InDesign
  to work in my documents. Our text is breaking in horrible ways right now after I've
  tried to fix it. Needless to say, my co-workers are angry at me. It was my idea
  to switch our dictionary to Canadian from US. \r\n\r\nAfter we typeset stories the
  editors check it for \"bad breaks\". I thought this was a ridiculous waste of time
  since we had a Canadian dictionary within the progam that we could apply to our
  documents. The \"bad breaks\" occur because the auto-hyphenation of the US dictionary
  which we've been using up until now. We want our words to break in the Canadian
  style.\r\n\r\nMy question is this:\r\n\r\nI've changed the InD dictionary preferences
  of all the computers in the art dept. to the Canadian dictionary. We flowed in our
  text and typeset it but now how it's hyphenating is worse than ever. It's breaking
  in very un-canadian and un-american ways. \r\nI can't figure out what I've done
  wrong and the editors are really annoyed with me. Also, in my preferences, I have
  \"Merge User Dictionary\" checked off. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm in a document and go to
  the dictionary, it's default is ENG. USA  and Language: USA\r\n\r\nWe haven't created
  a new template for this issue, so I wonder if that's the problem?\r\n\r\nHas Adobe
  played a cruel joke on us? Is there really no Canadian dictionary or like many others,
  do they just lump us in with the US figuring we're all the same?\r\n\r\nThanks so
  much for any help or any suggestions anyone can offer.\r\n\r\nI'm going to hide
  out in the bathroom 'til this all blows over.\r\n\r\n-S\r\n\r\n"

  body: "From my experience, and from what I hear others say, is that generally the
    proofing tools within InD are crap, especially the dictionary. In any language,
    its garbage as far as I am concerned, and I use it in english. I am forever adding
    word to the damn thing that should most certainly be part of its lexicon already.
    You may consider integrating <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/incopy/index.html\">Adobe
    InCopy</a> into your workflow, as it seems to be something that major publications
    use now. Essentially, its the linking program that combines the editing capabilities
    of a processing application with the design capabilities of the layout program.
    I have never personally used this program, so I have no idea if it is worth the
    expense, or the hassle of teaching your department. I have heard from a few though,
    that it works as a great solution to link editors and copywriters with their designer
    counterparts. \r\n\r\nHope that helps."

    body: "Thanks for your help. Yes, we do use InCopy. We had the edit team switch
      their InCopy prefs to the Canadian dictionary as well. We have had a lot of
      success with InCopy and it's much easier to use than the Quark counterpart,
      QPS. Unfortunately, this dictionary thing has just blown up in our face...well,
      my face. I just can't believe I have to have someone sit beside me with a CDN
      Oxford dictionary to check that InDesign hyphenated words in the right place.
      It seems so, well, lame and a big waste of time.\r\n\r\nI'm angry that I trusted
      Adobe to get that part right of their program right. \r\n\r\n-S"

    Computers, featuring NBA 2006 MVP Steve Nash (a Canadian). Nash has avoided the
    usual sponsorship opportunities and is plugging MDG, a Canadian computer manufacturer.
    The headline reads, \r\nLIGHTENING IS NOT SUPPOSE TO STRIKE TWICE. Set in Goudy
    Bold Caps with faux horizontal scaling and a dropshadow. You'd think they could
    of use a Canadian typeface, eh?!"

  body: "On another related note, from what I remember from English Classes and such,
    that you can really hyphenate a word anywhere, as long as you place the hyphen
    in between syllables, and not just arbitrairly in between two letters. For instance,
    the word typophile could be hyphenated as:\r\n\r\ntyp-ophile\r\ntypo-phile\r\ntypophi-le\r\n\r\nIs
    this incorrect? I only ask because if this rule is kosher, then you don't need
    to sit with the OED and a editing buddy, assuming though that you can sound out
    your syllables.\r\n\r\nP.S.- I am not familiar with Canadian, as I am English,
    the ones that live in America, not in England."

    body: "You're right about that but there's often a preferred hyphenation. At the
      magazine we have to be extremely consistent about our style so we use the Oxford
      Canadian Dictionary hyphenation style. Surprisingly, what's recommened is often
      different from US style of hyphenation. Oh! It's all so boring!\r\n\r\nOn another
      note, we found out that people have incorrectly changed their InDesign dictionary
      prefs so that might be where our stupid problem lies. We're going to start from
      scratch next issue. New templates and I'm going to change everyone's dictionary
      prefs myself. I think we're trailblazers on this one!\r\n\r\n-S"

  body: "This is an old thread, but has become relevant to us lately. I'm an editor
    at a Canadian magazine. We've just completed a redesign, and suddenly the hyphenation
    is terrible. It's not just a question of US vs. Canadian vs. UK style (they're
    all slightly different). Some of the breaks InDesign/InCopy is making aren't acceptable
    in any dictionary AFAIK. We use Canadian Oxford as our main dictionary, but we'd
    be willing to use another for hyphenation if InDesign would just do so consistently.\r\n\r\nI
    can't see how the change in body font could affect hyphenation, and our prefs
    haven't changed with the redesign, as far as we can tell. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, Track and Kern asks whether you can just break by syllable. That's not
    always true. From what I remember, US hyphenation tends to break according to
    the way a word is spoken and UK hyphenation tends to break according to word origin
    (so a break would fall right before a suffix, even if the pronounced syllable
    breaks elsewhere). Canadian probably falls in the middle. There are other subtleties
    that some publications follow, such as not breaking on so-called \"liquid ells,\"
    a final syllable ending (usually) in \"le.\" We avoid breaking bub-ble, for example."

  body: "There are a number of bugs that pop up with adding a user dictionary to the
    stock ID dictionary, with both both CS2 and CS3. We've reported this to Adobe,
    they have acknowledged it, and it *may* change in future releases. We go through
    bloody hell to use a custom dictionary, and vigilance is required to make sure
    the correct dictionary is in play with each job.\r\n\r\nAs to the hyphenation
    of \"typophile\":\r\n\r\nThe usual practice, in the States anyway, is that single
    vowels stay up. The proper hyphenation is typo-phile.\r\n\r\nYou will find some
    of those who don't break before a liquid ell (good idea) extending the notion,
    so that bubbling is not breakable. I've always felt that bub-bling is OK, bub-ble
    is not.\r\n\r\nRemember that disallowing hyphen points always involves a compromise:
    word spacing will be more uneven.\r\n"

  body: I'm curious about the types of problems that you guys are seeing. Can you
    give me examples of words that are incorrectly hyphenating in Canadian English?
    We try to get as much information as possible back to our dictionary vendors so
    they can be improved. It sounds serious.
