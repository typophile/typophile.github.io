    in my opinion. Specially for the R and B etc. But it's the closest I found so
    fare.. thanks.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestion is welcome!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I've seen those cuts on the cap C before. Isn't this a condensed Bank
    Gothic spaced really tightly? And maybe squoosed a little? The S isn't spot on,
    but the rest does feel similar enough to me.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of Bank Gothic
    version you could use. Maybe one enough feels more right for you than another."

    that not-rounded D (like the regular widths of Bank Gothic do). Not to mention
    those quote marks, which are so so so Bank Gothic\u2026"
