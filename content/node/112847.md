  don't know the name, style or what to search for.\r\n\r\nSorry for the poor quality,
  that's actually the reason I'm trying to track it down is to make a high quality
  version of the image.\r\n\r\nhttp://s30.postimg.org/o9xzkz4lt/Capture.png\r\n\r\nI
  have more examples of the different letters if that's helpful, but they are very
  low quality and very small, so not sure how useful they would be.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That is Ray Larabie's original free font Neuropol. It's been manually stretched
    and slanted - which results in all sorts of awkwardness in the curves and stem
    endings.\r\n\r\nMuch better would be the updated <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/neuropol-x/'
    target='_blank'>Neuropol X Italic or Bold Italic</a>.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the
    regular weight of Neuropol X is still free (click the purchase options link)."
