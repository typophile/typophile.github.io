    its height) can create problems in layouts where width is limited. \r\n"

  body: Yes, but I haven't come up with anything worthwhile. The length of the first
    word which is quite long vis a vis the second word which is quite short which
    has me stuck.

  body: Tank Lite has an alternate W with flat sides that might look more mechanical.
    Tank was made to be squeezed so you can make the whole thing narrower if you like.

  body: "> TIMBER\r\n> WORKS\r\n> TOYS\r\n\r\nI'd definitely explore that 3-line approach.
    I'd probably add a hyphen. The cutout in the \"O\" vaguely looks like a reversed-out
    hyphen anyway, so an actual hyphen might not look out of place after Timber.\r\n\r\nAnother
    approach to lessen the length would be to wrap the name into a shape. For example,
    make Timberworks an arch with Toys centered beneath it. Or wrap the name around
    3 sides of a square or diamond shaped (reversed out of the shape, I mean).  "

  body: If the O had square corners it would resemble the wooden blocks better. The
    second ones in the photo of all the different shapes looks a lot less razor-like,
    and would make a great O if stood on their shorter side. As it is, the fact that
    your O doesn't look so much like one of the blocks makes its treatment look a
    bit unnecessary to me.

  body: I like it. It looks more fun than the new one and it seems to offer more possibilities
    for the construction set. However it doesn't convey the durability of the toy
    which the new logo does, even if it didn't have the "made strong" tagline. Perhaps
    you could add that line to the original.

  body: what I like about the old logo is that it has some character/life to it. it
    may not have said solid or durable, but it did connect a 'fun' aspect to it. the
    revised logo stripped it clean of it's character. to me it's just too plain. I
    do however kinda like it better in a stacked layout, like JamesM suggested. maybe
    you can also alter the box shape to be like one of the toy blocks. just playing
    around. =) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/toys3_6189.jpg]

    replace the brown in 'Timberworks' and the outline of the badge by one of the
    colours from the word 'TOYS'. I think you should also make the word 'TOYS' more
    obviously conntected to 'TIMBERWORKS'. The colours of 'TOYS' are beautiful however.
    Perhaps you could give 'TIMBERWORKS' the same colouring as 'TOYS', but that might
    take away the robustness.\r\nGoodluck!\r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper"

    I'd be making the grey circle much lighter. My opinion.

    crowded to judge. The tag lines are way too small and will be totally illegible
    at smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nAlso, it's a bad idea to design in color, IMO. Get it
    down in black and white then add color. Even then, I'd say use three colors maximum.
    The multi-colored words are really not working, especially with all the other
    stuff currently going on."

  body: 'Definitely better stacked. Think you have over played idea and lost clarity:
    choice of typeface with lopped off corners instead of curves fights and breaks
    down the nice idea of echoing the shape of the play pieces in the ''O''s. As you
    haven''t copied the proportions of either of the actual pieces in those ''O''s
    they do not obviously read as the play shapes (especially with that extra confusion
    of the lopped off corners). Why not use one or the other piece shape accurately?
    Pull them out in colour? Photograph of piece version? Possibly only one ''O''
    not two? Some other condensed, blocky face good idea but would also close the
    letter spacing up v tight to emphasise those ''bites'' out the ''O'' and let them
    stand out.'
