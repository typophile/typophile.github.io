  seem to be identical to each other. But on closer inspection slight differences
  reveal themselves to the beholder (e.g. how the serifs flow out of the stems or
  how the curves are drawn).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve drawn a first comparison between some
  of the characters. I\u2019ve chosen the characters \u201CE\u201D, \u201CF\u201D,
  \u201Ce\u201D and \u201Cc\u201D, because \u201CE\u201D and \u201CF\u201D as well
  as \u201Ce\u201D and \u201Cc\u201D have some common ground, so that one can review
  the consistency and the homogeneity of the design.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare for example
  the upper arm of the uppercase E and F: within the DTL design they are identical;
  within the MT design they differ from each other. Or compare the (inner) left-hand
  curves of the lowercase e and c: Again within the DTL design they look alike and
  within the MT design they differ. The DTL design treats the same in the same way,
  the MT design does not. Moreover, the DTL curves are firmer drawn. So, in my opinion\u2014but
  I am only a layman\u2014the DTL design is more consistent and homogeneous.\r\n\r\nSo,
  what do you think? Which version do you prefer?"

    [...]</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhen released midst 1990\u2019s, both the DTL and Monotype
    versions of Albertina were identical, but I kept on working on the DTL versions
    since and every later version is a bit more different. Earlier in the 1990\u2019s
    Chris Brand gave me <em>carte blanche</em> and I simply could not resist improving
    the typeface within the existing metrics.\r\nThe OpenType format and hence the
    possible new font naming gave me the opportunity to enhance the letterforms and
    contours even further and also to occasionally change the metrics. So, the DTL
    OpenType version of Albertina differs most from the original editions and also
    contains a new \u2018Book\u2019 weight.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAt the moment I am finishing
    new Greek and Cyrillic versions (both scripts are exclusively available from DTL).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DTLAlbertina_overview_6621.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;"

  body: "Thank you for that information! The DTL Albertina is\u2014in my unprofessional
    eyes\u2014one of the most beautiful typefaces, but unfortunately it is high in
    price from the non-professional point of view (typography is my hobby and not
    my job), so I have to save up for it for a while \u2026\r\n\r\nAre there any other
    ligatures included in the OpenType format besides the \u203Afi\u2039 and \u203Afl\u2039
    ligature?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
