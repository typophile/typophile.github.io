  the hoop, sometimes it doesn't. What do people feel this says about a font? Does
  one design communicate any concepts the other does not? Musings, either philosophical,
  cultural, visual or even  marketable interpretations and impressions are all welcome.
  If you have designed a font without historical dictations, which form did you choose,
  and why?\r\n\r\nI have my own impressions, but I will let this thread steep a bit
  first. :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/as_4016.jpg]"

  body: "(see [[Fraktur]])\r\n\r\nFraktur was developed at the court of the Emperor
    Maximilian V, in Nuremberg, around 1517. A team of artists, including the calligrapher
    Johann Neudoerffer the Elder. and Albrecht D\xFCrer were involved. \r\n\r\nI read
    somewhere that the ornate capital letters were inspired by the Emperor's own handwriting.
    The lowercase at least seems to have evolved out of Schwabacher. Certainly Schwabacher
    had a single-storey a. I think that uncial styles also used single-storey a's.
    But Carolingian miniscule, the basis for both blackletter and humanistic scripts
    (even though humanist resembles it much more closely ;-)  ), used a double-storey
    a.\r\n\r\nGerrit Noordzij, in LetterLetter, has his own counter-theory. He writes
    that the Nuremberg history was not how Fraktur came about at all. Rather, Fraktur
    was created by Burgundian artisans in what is now present-day Belgium during the
    1400s. Maximilian's mother was Burgundian, and apparently, he favored this style
    all his life. "

  body: "The single-story 'a' seems to have existed right alongside the double story
    since the dawn of lowercase. However, when I look at one, I think stripped-down,
    modernism, industrialism and such. This is probably due to its use in most 'bauhaus'
    and 'futura' -like fonts, as well as its simplieifed design.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    while I was researching my current task, I noticed that other overtly-stark or
    utilitarian fonts such as OCR and Letter Gothic use the two story version. Does
    this imply that the single story, in a modern sans, is faddish, or \"so last century\"?
    Does fashion alone have a major effect on individual letters? Is there a more
    solid theory for choosing between the two?\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

    body: "<em>a single-storey a runs too much risk of being mistaken for a q</em>\r\n\r\nAlas,
      this seems to be quite true. I decided upon the singular a in the face I am
      working on this morning. After looking at both, it seemed better suited to the
      overall coldness I am seeking. Looked great.\r\n\r\nThen I scaled things down.
      Suddenly the enduring appeal of the double story a across so many different
      styles was evident. :( Has the demands of low resolution increased our need
      for it, making other use it where they would have preferred the singular style?\r\n\r\nHas
      anyone found any other tricks for making a single-story legible and distinct,
      that they will share?\r\n\r\nBecause a is so common in most Latin-based writing,
      I think that even offering a variant for large sizes would dilute or confuse
      the font, so I may be stuck with the arc after all.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

    (which another thread was linked to). I personally don't like single story "a"s
    except in italics. I like my single story "a"s to mimic calligraphy as much as
    possible.
