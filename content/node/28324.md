  body: "Ben \u2013 have you tried going directly to Monotype? Or the Type Museum?
    or St Bride Printing Library? They're all a long way from Melbourne but worth
    a try.\r\n\r\np.62 of Neil Macmillans 'An A-Z of Type Designers' gives Calisto
    as a 1987 design by Ron Carpenter. I remember reading about his design for Cantoria
    in an early piece of Monotype trade literature, but this may have predated Calisto.
    According to the source above, Carpenter has worked with Dalton Maag since 1996,
    so you could try looking on their website too."
