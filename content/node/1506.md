body: Hi,  <BR> <BR>I am new to this board.. well posting wise.. &#40;my first post!&#41;
  but i&#39;ve been reading it alot over the past few months.  <BR> <BR>anyways,  <BR>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>currently im taking typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our
  current project is to design a 27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face.
  of all faces I was given times new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people
  thought about this, or any suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured
  this place could help me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5
  times, replacing the created character with a letter in a 5 letter word.  <BR> <BR>my
  current concerns pertain to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance
  down as the &#39;j&#39; ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking
  at the face, and i guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in
  the alphabet like the loop on the &#39;g&#39; my professor brought this up in critique
  tonight.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17783.gif" alt="Kerned

  body: 'Hi Drew, <BR> <BR>Let me be honest. I think the length of your decender is
    the  <BR>least of your problems! Sorry... <BR> <BR>As a start at curing your letter
    of it&#39;s maladies, let me point  <BR>you to Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s course at
    typeophile that looks at  <BR>the very assignment you&#39;ve got: <a href="http://typophile.com/courses.html">Type
    Design 110</a> <BR> <BR>Honestly, first check out what he&#39;s saying. What are
    the  <BR>characteristics of times roman? Given that, is the basic  <BR>stucture
    of the &#34;letter&#34; consistent with Times? How could it  <BR>be more Times-like
    in structure? Where is there evidence of  <BR>a pen? What angle is it held at?
    As a result, where are the  <BR>thick parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are
    the serifs?  <BR>Where does times roman break it&#39;s own rules? <BR> <BR>Your
    glyph needs all these questions to be asked. Take a  <BR>look, and if you&#39;re
    still at a loss, I&#39;ll give you more specific,  <BR>practical pointers. <BR>
    <BR>Looking forward to seeing the fruit of your studies! <BR>'
