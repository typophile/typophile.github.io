body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nFor my thesis (Computer science) I need three typefaces:\r\n\r\n1.
  One for titles (Serif or Sans-Serif)\r\n2. A Serif for the body (I've chosen Joanna
  by E. Gill)\r\n3. A monospaced typeface for the portions of code\r\n\r\n\r\nI need
  suggestions for the first and for the third typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance"

  body: "An obvious and pretty conservative choice for titles would be Gill Sans (or,
    if you're feeling fancier, this: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/gill-new-antique/).\r\nIn
    the same vein, maybe also Cabin could work.\r\n\r\nAs for monospaced fonts, there
    are several that could fit the bill (Anonymous, Droid Mono, Inconsolata, Consolas...)
    you should start with the one you're using for actual programming and see how
    well it prints out."

  body: "1) What's the thesis about, specifically?\r\n2) How long is the text?\r\n3)
    What are the nature and frequency of the illustrations?\r\n4) Why did you choose
    Joanna?\r\n\r\nFor a monospaced font, you might choose a design by\r\nsomebody
    who is both a programmer and a type designer:\r\nhttp://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html\r\nBut
    the questions above come first.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
