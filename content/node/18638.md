  body: I'd probably pass on it for the same reason I delete emailed jokes without
    reading them. 9 times out of 10 they're just not funny and I feel like I've wasted
    a few more ticks of my life. But, hey, anythings gotta be more entertaining than
    reading w3.org

  body: I already know most of the stuff in it, but I picked up the book because I
    was curious about their approach to teaching the subject. I think it would probably
    be a very good book for a beginning web designer, or someone who thinks coding
    a page is too hard and has been using so-called WYSIWYG html editors. It's very
    thorough and advocates good web coding practices. One thing I like about it is
    that there are a lot of explanations about reasons why to do things or why things
    are the way they are. The off-the-wall tone I'm sure would put some people off,
    but I think it might work for a lot of people.
