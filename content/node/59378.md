    logos.\r\n\r\nThat being said, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/trajan/?&sample_text=OBSESSION\">Perpetua
    Titling</a> comes pretty close to Obsession, and you can approximate the Chanel
    logo with <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\">H&FJ
    Gotham</a>."
