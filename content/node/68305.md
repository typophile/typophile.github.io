    a maginfication once more if this would help. Its similar to both that you mention
    but\r\nnot exactly. Maybe small cap \"e\" with diagonal line and \"l\" with line
    on the top wil be helpfull.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SS font_6090.jpg]"

    If that's true, that would rule out Interstate, which has a horizontal crossbar
    on the 'e'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
