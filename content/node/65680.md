  for ages, but no luck so far. The closest I could find was Arctic2, but that one's
  still way off.\r\nAnybody know this one?"

    samples of that one..

    me - see the 3 different 'e'.

  body: "I have a German book of Script Types and it shows a range of A-named fonts,
    including Arctic, which are all very similar. The variations are in stroke thickness,
    width and slant. You can see small samples of many of them in the Solotype Catalog
    (p.88 and 89). I am trying to compare your images to these two sources.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "There are many more of these, some starting with J, and they are almost every
    variation you can imagine. In addition, Photo-Lettering had many styles that seem
    to be extremely similar, with completely different names. Arctic seems quite close,
    but nothing I saw was absolutely identical. It's possible that custom lettering
    was done for them by one of the lettering artists who did these similar film types.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "The time period is during the film type era, and many of the film types were
    drawn freehand by lettering artists (without drawing instruments, that is). Of
    digital fonts I would say Arctic2, by Sam Wang is the closest I could find. URW
    has digitized a number of similar scripts, but in different weights, such as Arab
    Brushstroke, Contemporary Brush, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/april/|April]]
    (which is a lot like Arctic, but condensed), and Amber (which is like a bold April).
    I think these all were originally Filmotype typefaces.\r\n\r\n(I didn't link all
    of these, since most of them are less like your sample)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
