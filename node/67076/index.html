It is not a sans serif, but there could be a lot to do for everybody: not just ligatures, but language variants; cyrillics, and Greek. I've done some lower case ligtures, but upper case is untouched. And upper to lower case.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I think Brian does have a point, and this font was really just for a study of ligatures, so I'm happy to put this up for Typophile font, and see where it goes.

There are many ligatures I've made I don't like, so feel free to do over everything. And if anybody has a solution to make a ligature ending with 'a', I'd like to see that.

So, where should I put the .fvb-file?

And who is the first to take it over?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've organized [small] software development projects, and I thought I explained a decent scheme in that other thread. But I personally would have no hard feelings if the collective willpower is not strong enough to make this happen. I certainly don't want only 2-3 of us actually doing this. For one thing, I don't have <em>that</em> much free time. But most of all, to me at least this is sort of a "social experiment", so it would have to be highly collaborative to be interesting.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree. We should have a fair number of people participating on this. We have Cyrillic glyphs promised, and I should think we can get Greek glyphs as well.

Now, what we need is designers. To take the font file and work it. And then give it to the next designer.

How do we do that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Simplicity is useful. But I think the simplicity of taking turns working on the font would be fatally prohibitive.

So I suggest we have a central, semi-public repository of primarily* font files and text files. Each font file would be named in a way that indicates what existing font it's an extension/modification of (see that other thread), and the text files (which could actually be judiciously Subject-ed emails) would mostly explain who did what.

* It would also be useful to have EPS/PDF files for evaluation.

So a person could look through the font files and the text files, decide where/how to jump in, and make new font/text files. And the whole time we'd be showing our work-in-progress on Typophile for feedback on which branch(es) to pursue.

But this is your baby, so if you have a totally different idea that's fine, and in any case I'll help with whatever time I can find.

Your approach seems to be working to me. I signed with Adrive, but I'm having trouble finding sharing options.

And my apologies to John Hudson; after some sleep and things like common sense, UFO in fact looks like a very good way to get this going, with the people behind it.
