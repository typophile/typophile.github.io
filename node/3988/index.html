  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, I am about to begin work on my first typeface. This will be a digitization of the letters that my grandfather drew on Christmas cards and the like. It&#39;s sort of a Bodoni-esque style filtered threw my grandpa&#39;s congenital hand tremor. <BR> <BR>The reason I am posting is this: I have enough experience in other things to know that there are usually important questions to ask one&#39;s self at the outset of a project like this. Having zero experience in making a typeface, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m asking myself enough questions, or the right ones, or all of them.   <BR> <BR>My question for you is this: from your experience, what are the major and minor considerations for creating a typeface based on the sample posted below? <BR> <BR>Thank you very much, <BR> <BR>Alex G. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32183.jpg" alt="The year he got me a subscription to the Nation..."></div>

		<div class="commentbody">That&#39;s outstanding. <BR> <BR>Some suggestions: give the serifs a little more weight on some of the glyphs. For instance, your grandpa&#39;s N in Nation has very pronounced serifs. <BR> <BR>Also, and I know this is somewhere in the future, but I&#39;d love to see an italic version, such as he used in &#34;for a year.&#34; Good stuff!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with John ... I do like the N is NATION more than the one in NASAL. I agree with Nicolai&#39;s comment about the O as well. The R in HONOR seems a little too droopy. The B might be a little narrow, or maybe the E is too wide? <BR> <BR>This is fun, reminds me of Didot. You might reference Didot on a few of these characters. I really d like the warmth of it, reminds me of old movie titles.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You&#39;re right, this is very close to Didot. I&#39;d been looking at a version of Bodoni for guidance, but there were some differences between it and the character of my grandpa&#39;s letters that I had to work around. Didot is a much closer fit. <BR> <BR>And thanks for your comments. This is my first typographic effort, and it&#39;s more difficult than I expected. I feel encouraged. Ultimately I&#39;d like to do the italic, and also an outline version of the capitals.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I haven&#39;t given up yet. I do need some critical guidance though: I&#39;ve been trying to reconstruct the lower case using a combination of g&#39;pop style and didot. I&#39;m particularly concerned with the letters: a, e, and especially g.   <BR> <BR>The &#39;g&#39; is driving me nuts: sticking to the principle that this font is a version of didot as imagined by an 80-something retired architect with a hand tremor, I&#39;ve decided that a binocular &#39;g&#39; is not something he would have done. I&#39;ve also decided that using an uppercase &#39;g&#39; in the lowercase isn&#39;t something that I want to do. I think the best approach is to didonicize a cursive g, which is what I&#39;ve been trying to do with very little success.  Any suggestions would be very welcome. <BR> <BR>Another concern:  I read somewhere that having many anchor points in a font outline creates problems with computer printers, etc. Is this style a problem? Or is this a concern that belongs to several years back when things weren&#39;t quite as robust? <BR> <BR>Current samples: <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62; <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62; <BR></div>
