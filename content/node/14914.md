  some new fonts (some of which will be posted here for critique in the near future),
  to include taking some of my old, free-for-download fonts, and reworking them into
  a full character set.\r\n\r\nIn poking around the web, I'm dismayed at the number
  of sites out there that redistribute fonts with impunity, and the number of people
  asking around in forums for \"clones\"...it really makes me wonder how I'll ever
  actually recoup my investment in hardware, books, training, art supplies, etc.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm wondering...is it time to add DRM (digital rights management) to fonts?  Maybe
  a DRM'ed OpenType format?  Here in the States, we're not covered by copyright, and
  I'm sick of seeing others profit from my work.  In the past I've been rabidly anti-DRM,
  but the more I poke around, and the more fonts I see from myself, and the people
  I know, being offered for free, the more and more annoyed I get.\r\n\r\nAnyone have
  any opinions?  Does there need to be an OpenType 2.0 format with support for DRM?"

    me feel like it would be a really bad idea to attempt to create typefaces for
    anything other than a hobby. Why create a product that, as soon as it is released,
    loses it\u2019s initial value because it is free in the eyes of so many?\r\nIt
    could work like the iTunes Music Store\u2019s m4p format. If you buy a license
    for 5 CPUs, it would have to be authorized on all 5 computers. It would be a big
    harry deal to get implemented and for it to work across networks but it would
    be worth it.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "<em>How will DRM keep people from pirating typefaces?</em>\r\n\r\nProbably
    the same way many programs keep people from pirating software. In order to use
    the font, it would have to be activated over the internet. The process of activation
    would identify the font registration number and the ID of the computer. A five-seat
    license would allow activation up to five times, then would refuse to validate
    any other further requests for activation. Font pirates could steal all the fonts
    they wanted to, but they would find them pretty useless if they couldn't install
    them on their computers.\r\n\r\nThe BIGGEST problem with this approach is, then,
    how do you legally send your fonts to a printer or a service bureau? Special exception
    activation for recognized/registered professionals? Or, maybe, a new font format
    -- let's call it Portable Font Format -- that would travel with a job, install
    on one machine and one machine only, download to a RIP, and then self-destruct
    in <em>x</em> number of days. Or there may be a better, more elegant solution..."

    hard to get right. My advice to type people is to let Hollywood go through all
    the pain of trying to implement a workable DRM first, and then adopt any successful
    solutions that may emerge from there.\r\n\r\nIn any case, for a bad implementation
    of DRM to take hold would be one of the biggest boons I can imagine for the free
    type scene. Bands of font users will happily pool funding for type designers to
    release their work freely so they don't have to deal with the hassles of DRM,
    versions of software that don't support it, etc. Of course, monkeys will fly out
    of my butt first, but that hasn't stopped proponents of DRM from advancing their
    schemes in the past."

  body: "> the same way many programs keep people from pirating software. \r\n\r\nHeh
    heh. The only programs where DRM keeps people from pirating them are the ones
    that are not popular enough to be cracked. Practically every DRM scheme in the
    world can be cracked, one way or another. In doubt, a cracker can always run the
    software in a \"sandbox\" environment, wait for the software to unprotect the
    content and load it into memory, then make a memory dump and put the content back
    into unprotected form. \r\n\r\nSoftware activation schemes can be very very annoying.
    I nearly returned Acrobat 7 because its activation scheme was implemented in a
    way that had the program force me to re-activate it about twice a week. \r\n\r\nPlus,
    I hope you realize that a new DRM-protected format would require new operating
    systems, new applications, new printers and new document formats to be developed.
    Otherwise, after being unlocked, the font would still need to travel unprotected
    at some point -- with the risk of being grabbed there. From a PostScript file,
    PDF file, operating system cache, a Bezier drawing application etc. You cannot
    protect the outlines from being read, while on the other hand allowing some application
    to draw the outlines on the screen. It's a conceptual contradiction. \r\n\r\nAnd
    if everything fails, you can always plug an audio in jack into your audio out
    socket and record the music onto a different device, print the password-protected
    document, scan and OCR it back in, and do an analogic action to a font. \r\n\r\nI
    think it's already quite an effort and achievement to have a customer pay money
    for a piece of bits and bytes (e.g. a font) in the first place. \r\n\r\nThe best
    copy protection mechanism for a font is never to release it. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    possibility, sometime in the near future. Nonetheless, I agree with most of what
    Adam has said. I'm just wondering why anyone \"talented\" enough to crack ANY
    protection scheme is bothering with fonts; shouldn't they be working for a spy
    agency?\r\n\r\nIn the end, all of us who make and sell fonts are dependent upon
    the honest people who respect our work, and are willing to pay for it. The thieves
    will always be with us: it's an unfortunate fact of life. If you let the thieves
    dictate your behavior, they've stolen more than just fonts."

  body: "> crack ANY protection scheme is bothering with fonts\r\n\r\nThe thing is:
    it cannot be \"any\" protection, it can be fairly simple at best. \"Spy-quality\"
    protections can be very sophisticated because they're single-purpose. They are
    typically used by a small closed group of trained individuals, to communicate
    within the same organization. A DRM system for fonts cannot be hugely complex
    because you expect fonts to be used in different environments: different operating
    systems, different applications, developed by very different people using different
    software toolkits. OpenType is aiming at ISO standardization now. \r\n\r\nOf course,
    anybody is free to develop their own proprietary font format, with a proprietary
    protection scheme, and have these fonts work in specialized software. This has
    been done in the past. DMC Calamus, a professional and very sophisticated layout
    and typesetting system for Atari ST/TT used its own font format (.cfn) that was
    protected: each font was encrypted and tied to a specific serial number of Calamus
    installed by the user. This was 15 years ago and digital fonts were hot stuff
    back then, so the protection scheme was cracked in no time. \r\n\r\nWith more
    than 50,000 fonts available on the market today, it's really a challenge for the
    foundry to come up with new qualities for the typeface to be attractive. I think
    if you build up additional barriers and annoying copy protection mechanisms, you
    run the risk that potential customers will turn their backs on you. They'll stick
    with the fonts they have or will go to the competition who sells fonts at more
    liberal terms. This is already happening. Some vendors try blocking the possibility
    of embedding their fonts into electronic documents and you will notice customers
    voting with their wallets: they revert to other vendors who don't have the limitation.
    \r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, it's better to compete by quality or pricing than
    by barbed wires and muzzles. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "There are many problems with DRM for fonts.\r\n\r\nOne big problem is that
    there are so many reasonable uses of fonts that many foundries might want to permit,
    which would be nigh-impossible to reconcile with DRM. Oldnick's question about
    service bureaus is high on the list, for instance.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by Adam,
    the difficulty of plugging holes is a particular problem. Because fonts are accessed
    by virtually every application, and must be compatible with virtually all printer
    drivers, much of the key value of the font must be made accessible to these third
    party bits. How you let fonts be accessible to apps and printable without exposing
    the IP so that an application could scoop it up is a big problem.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    there's the problem of ticking off your legitimate users by making things difficult
    for them. As Raph says, it's very hard to get DRM just \"right\" to strike a useful
    balance between security and usability. I happen to believe that the DRM currently
    used by Adobe's apps is one of the least irksome implementations I've ever seen.
    But Adam's particular workflow manages to totally trip up Adobe's DRM, and it
    is really an unhappy experience for him (I forget exactly what it is - I think
    he sometimes boots off an external HD and sometimes not, or something like that).
    There is no DRM scheme yet implemented that isn't at least this problematic.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    has indeed implemented DRM (copy protection) for fonts three times now. First
    the earliest Type 1 fonts were tied to a particular output device (this in the
    days before true WYSIWYG for fonts). We eventually dropped that. Then later we
    came up with some intricate stuff for install-based protection of Asian fonts
    (Type 1 CID-keyed fonts). Finally we even flirted with doing much the same thing
    for OpenType, also intended for the Asian market. But we decided not to go down
    that path, as well as discontinuing our scheme for protected Asian fonts.\r\n\r\nWhy
    not? When we totalled up the engineering costs, plus the hassle to our users,
    it really easily outweighed the value of the presumably prevented piracy.\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment, Adobe corporately has approximately zero interest (rounded to the
    nearest percentage) in DRM for fonts.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, if you really
    want to, you can do DRM for fonts today. PACE Interlok technology works. Of course,
    you have to pay them a bunch of money (their web site doesn't even say how much).
    I've seen some Asian fonts that were using it. Of course, we couldn't immediately
    figure out why the protected fonts weren't working quite right, because the font
    was encrypted....  http://www.paceap.com/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
