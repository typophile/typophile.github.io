  body: "Did you download an Acrobat update recently? There's a known bug in newly-released
    version 8.2.4 which is causing serious problems for some users. \r\n\r\nAdobe
    is aware of the problem and is working on a fix, but currently the only remedy
    is to revert back to an earlier version of Acrobat. \r\n\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/thread/704315\r\n\r\n"
