    the answer to my own question, it's able press.\r\nI have it on my system but
    got tripped up because although it's on my hdd it won't install...\r\nCan't figure
    it out why it won't install as I have used it before.\r\n\r\nThink I'll have to
    try mac forum now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ablepress_4637.png]"
