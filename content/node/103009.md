  in [[http://neoaristotelica.eu/download/sample.pdf|this file]]?\r\n\r\nMore specifically,
  I would like to hear your opinions on the following points:\r\n1) How do you find
  the pairing of the greek  and latin fonts (p. 15)?\r\n2) Running headers look a
  bit weird above secondary titles and headings (p.26). Can anything be done about
  that?\r\n3) P. 102-103 illustrates a problem with second-  (or more-) level headings.
  The first-level heading can be tabbed so that the text of the heading alingns with
  left indent of the paragraph below. But it is not possible with lower headings,
  since there is to little space. Increasing the paragraph indent would not work because
  the number in the first-level heading would be too far from the text of the heading.
  Surely I am not the first person to be solving this problem?\r\n\r\nThank you for
  any input.\r\n\r\nNolmendil"

    the Greek seems a bit too coarse (and the spacing is uneven).\r\n- If you can't
    find a better Greek (which would be surprising, unless it's a budgetary issue)
    I think you've done a decent job; I might make the Greek slightly larger, but
    then the color might get too dark.\r\n\r\n* Is it only on page 15?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Hrant.\r\nAs for fonts, I have to go with free ones. What exactly
    do you mean by \"coarse\", BTW? In this issue, Greek is only on p. 15, but every
    now and then in the journal an article appears with extensive quotations in polytonic
    Greek. As for size - I've aimed at the same x-height as of the Latin font - do
    you mean that the Greek looks smaller than the Latin font, or does it seem the
    same to you but would wish it to be larger? I confess I hate varying x-heights... "

    that's the case?\r\n\r\nBy \"coarse\" I meant that the outlines are very wobbly,
    noticeably more so than in the Latin.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I hate varying x-heights...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPeople
    do like to line things up! But when it comes to reading-size text (as opposed
    to display typography) I believe there are more important factors, and people
    don't notice misalignment. When it comes to the way Latin and Greek each use the
    \"Cartesian space\" there seems to be a need to make Greek's \"x-height\" bigger
    (and at the expense of the ascenders, not the descenders). Admittedly few people
    actually do this when designing such a multi-script typeface, but I think it's
    just a matter of people getting over their desire to line things up and seeing
    the benefits of breaking the alignment. Note for example how in Latin the ascenders
    are usually better when they're slightly taller than the caps, not lined up.\r\n\r\nBTW
    there's a very long -if valuable- recent thread about Greek typography:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/101331\r\nYulia
    in that thread has actually made the Greek \"x-height\" bigger in her work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Luk\xE1\u0161,\r\n\r\nthe editorial content of the journal looks complex,
    so I think that, in general, you have made a good work, althought I don't totally
    go along with the Junicode typepace.\r\n\r\nOn running heads (on top): try to
    keep author and article title on one single line, set everything in small caps
    (without initial caps)\r\n\r\nOn level headings (102-103): your choice seems correct,
    having set the first level (Loux\u2019s arguments) in small caps and the second
    one (The argument from change) in upper and lower case. I don't know if the bolds
    are the best choice, I usually set paragraphs' title in italics. Anyway, I wonder
    if in the main text typeface the bold old style figures aren't available.\r\n\r\nBesides
    that, a couple of suggestions:\r\n\r\nThe ornamental break is elegant but looks
    too large; I would choose a less invading element.\r\n\r\nOn the articles' title
    pages (for example, p. 28), I would align the title on top margin.\r\n\r\nThe
    colophon page looks too dense; try a smaller size for texts.\r\n\r\nMaybe, I would
    extract the \"Articles\" indication on page 13 and put it in a single page (11);
    or, if you keep it on the same page, set it smaller (same for Notes and discussions
    on page 89, and Review Articles on 99).\r\n\r\nHope it helps."

    body: "Nicolacaleffi: Thanks for your thoughts, let me comment:\r\n- I must say
      that I like the Junicode face the more the more I am using it; what is your
      problem with it?\r\n- My problem with the headings is that there seems to be
      no way in the second-level heading to align the text (i.e. what comes after
      the number) with the paragraph indent of the following paragraph. Or is it just
      my problem and noone else is bothered by the slight difference? (In third-level
      headings the problem is not so painful, since the three numbers and two dots
      push the text so much to the right that the alignment with paragraph indent
      is not visually expected (at least not by myself).\r\n- There are old-style
      figures for all weights and styles, but they seemed to me out of place in headings.
      \ I know the relationship between old-style and lining figures is not precisely
      equivalent to that of lowercase to uppercase letters, but to a certain point
      there is an analogy. Do you think this notion is wrong?\r\n- I will consider
      your other suggestions, especially the running headers. Concerning these - do
      you think a rule separating the header from the body text might be a good alternative
      idea?\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "Luk\xE1\u0161,\r\n\r\nOn Junicode: perhaps I have a personal idiosyncrasy
    with (digital) Caslon, or this fonts looks somehow unresolved to me. But it's
    hard to judge a typeface only onscreen, and if you're happy with it, go with it.\r\n\r\nOn
    headings sub-level and indent alignment: now (I think) I got what you mean, and
    it's not that disturbing for me.\r\n\r\nOn old style figures: if you use them
    in the roman weights, I think you should also use them in the bold (and also in
    small caps: \"2. Loux\u2019s arguments...\")\r\n\r\nOn running headers: I wouldn't
    separate them from the body text with a rule (also consider that in some pages
    you already have a line above the footnotes). Simply set them in one single line
    with the right (visual) distance from the first line of text."

    journal, I am an editor and typesetter in one, unpaid for that work, all around
    us the standard is \"just use Times New Roman and don't make such a fuss about
    it\" - so I do not feel like asking the publisher to buy a professional font for
    a few Greek words in an issue. Besides, I started typesetting 10 years ago as
    a complete amateur, and only taught myslef things \"by doing\". I have some confidence
    now, but not enough to trust myself so much as to dare to convince someone that
    we really need to buy just this one very expensive font and no free one will do."
