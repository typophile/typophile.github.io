  ligatures\r\n- old style numbers\r\n- small caps\r\n\r\nInitially I went for the
  Tex-Gyre project. They offer a free and enhanced version of URW New Century Schoolbook
  (Tex-Gyre Schola). But... I can't really say what it is, but URW's NCS just looks
  \"wrong\". Maybe it's the character spacing? URW NCS looks extremely wide, compared
  to other versions of NCS like\r\n\r\nNew Century Schoolbook from Linotype. Which
  looks really nice and just \"right\", but even though I have the OpenType version,
  ligatures and old style numbers seem not to work (I've used Word 2010). Or is it
  just my version? (got NCS LT via Folio 11 is installed on this machine).\r\n\r\nWhich
  vendor has the best NCS?\r\n"

    ago & far away, it came free with certain Microsoft products, but no more.\r\n\r\nIIRC,
    it is OpenType, ttf flavored, (but check before buying!) and I'd assume that to
    the extent MS Word supports OT features, it would support them in its own fonts...\r\n\r\nIf
    you want Open Source, (nonrestrictive license), you'll have to do a lot of work
    on the TeX Gyre CS. As you say, it's pretty bad. Alternatively, though not \"Schoolbook,\"
    SIL Charter may have the look you want.\r\n\r\nWhat the world could really use,
    Kent Lew, is a good Primer. (Think of Primer as the thinking man's Century Schoolbook.
    It was good enough for P.J. Conkwright to use for Princeton's Thoreau series.)"

  body: "As far as I know, no one of the available digital versions of Century Schoolbook
    features nor small caps neither old style figures (so it's not a matter of compatibility
    with MS Word, Peter). But I could be wrong. The only typeface related to Century
    Schoolbook with both os figures and small caps seems to be Mark Simonson's Grad,
    which has its own unique design features, by the way:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/grad.html"

  body: "Yes, of course, Charis.\r\n\r\nThe TeX-Gyre version of Century Schoolbook
    does have some terribly done os figs. Kindergarden level, or maybe not even that
    good. It also has small caps, can't remember how badly done they are.\r\n\r\nBut
    the Original Poster also mentioned that ligatures don't work, and those should
    be in the Linotype font. They were in the Linotron 202 standard-format font, &
    by in large, the PostScript versions offered by Linotype had all the glyphs of
    those older \"digital-photocomp\" fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks everyone. I investigated a little bit more.\r\n\r\nIndeed Nicola,
    none of the digital versions seem to have small caps or old style figures.\r\n\r\nThe
    Microsoft (Monotype) Century Schoolbook that is bundled with e.g. Microsoft Office
    2007 is not an OpenType version. It is a TrueType font, so of course there are
    none of the advanced OpenType features (like ligatures) available.\r\n\r\nI've
    checked the Linotype NCS I own with DTL OTMaster Light, and it does have ligatures
    for fi and fl. These will be actually replaced by Word 2010. But strangely there
    are no Ligatures for ff, ft, fl or combinations like fft and ffl. Does someone
    know, whether this is fixed in later versions of LT's NCS? Having proper ligatures
    would be at least something. \r\n\r\nBut overall, it seems the only choice is
    to go either for Grad, or to stick with Tex-Gyre Schola (*shudder*). Or Charis
    SIL (but which has afaik no old style figure).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've drawn up os figs for Charis, roman & italic. It's open source. If you
    really want to use it, we can probably find a way to get them to you. \r\n\r\nAll
    this predicated on your being able to copy the glyphs into your fonts and write
    the OT feature to call them (& be able to compile) with DTL OTMaster Light. Never
    used that program.\r\n\r\nOh, IIRC, I've got better ligatures, too. \r\n\r\n(I'd
    give you my Charis fonts, but I've dropped a lot of the characters -- Some because
    I just never need them, but most because I use FontLab Studio for compiling the
    OT features, and FontLab can't (currently) handle \"mark\" and \"mkmk\", which
    SIL used. So, I had to rewrite all the features as well, and added more. Some
    I'm sure MS Word won't implement, but that probably wouldn't hurt anything. You
    could have the fonts, but I can't afford to take time to support them.)\r\n\r\nFYI,
    in the days of photocomp, Linotype reduced the ligature set to just the fi and
    fl. When they re-released these fonts in PostScript, they didn't add any more
    ligatures for most fonts. The company's been sold several times since then; I've
    not seen any evidence the parent company wants to improve the old offerings."
