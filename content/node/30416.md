  Is this possible and how would I code it?\r\n\r\nThanks for all geekly advice!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Hey ChrisL,\r\n\r\nI'm sure other people know much more than I do, but I
    was trying teaching myself how to do this the other day so I'll at least get you
    started. If all of your caps are in a class (we'll call the class \"caps\" in
    this example), then you can just use the OpenType cpsp feature do add units (xx)
    to the sidebearings as such:\r\n\r\nfeature cpsp {\r\n    pos @caps &lt;xx 0 xx
    0&gt;;\r\n} cpsp;\r\n\r\nI bet I'm missing something important, so I encourage
    others to respond and fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nDavid"

  body: "David,\r\nThanks for the info! I am not clear on the x's and o's though.
    I asume your \"xx\" equals the value of increase in units. Is the \"o\" the glyph?
    or could it be the class name?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "At best with two examples:\r\n\r\npos Adieresis &lt;5 0 10 0&gt;;\r\npos
    @caps &lt;5 0 10 0&gt;;\r\n\r\nThe 'pos' command is followed either by a glyph
    name or a class name.\r\n\r\nEnclosed are, left to right: x placement adjustment,
    y placement adjustment, x advance adjustment, y advance adjustment.\r\nSo, the
    example says: The outlines of glyph 'Adieresis' are moved to the right at 5 units,
    and then the advance width is increased by ten.\r\nThis looks a bit complicated
    at first, but has to do with the fact that a font does not know about a rightside
    bearing; rather, the rightside bearing is advance width  -- the glyph's total
    width including leftside and rightside bearings -- minus leftside bearing.\r\nWhat
    the example does is: it increases both leftside and rightside bearing at 5 units
    each.\r\n\r\nThe second and forth number remain zero because you do not want to
    move the glyph up or down.\r\n(Instead of adding extra glyphs and substitute them
    in the 'case' feature, you could as well add a lookup with commands like\r\npos
    parenleft &lt;0 20 0 0&gt;;\r\npos parenright &lt;0 20 0 0&gt;;\r\nwhich will
    raise glyphs a bit if you select 'All Caps'.)\r\n\r\nThe Feature File Syntax (html)
    document which accompanies the AFDKO is a very good reference for this."
