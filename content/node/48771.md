  text comes from scans of illustrations in Parley's magazine circa 1838. \r\n\r\nMy
  untrained and blunt eye sees something like Baskerville. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    took screen shots from the character map of ITC Century Book. Might the terminals
    be slightly different on other versions? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Even though Century is very close (and I know just said \"close enough\"),
    I've realized that its impossible for it to be the one because it was cut almost
    60 years after Parley's was published. I imagaine it wouldn't be a crime to use
    Century in this case but now curiosity is pushing me on.\r\n\r\nHere are some
    more images of the magazine if anyone is equally curious. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rubylane.com/ni/shops/tomjudy/iteml/885-d#pic1\"
