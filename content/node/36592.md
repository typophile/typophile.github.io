  body: "If this is a font, it has been customized (check out the length of the lower
    bar on both 'S's. My guess is that this was just created using a grid and rounded
    strokes in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: That's how I would do it as well -- I couldn't find anything yet. Also the
    fact that the characters fit together like a puzzle point in the direction of
    a custom designed piece.

  body: To my knowledge <em>Baby Teeth</em> and <em>Pluto Outline</em> never were
    digitized. <em>Block</em> can be found <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/block-be/">here</a>.
    <em>Cable Heavy</em> is a rip-off of Kabel, I don't know if it is the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/kabel_std_ot_virtual/">ATF</a>
    or the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_kabel/">ITC</a>
    version you need. And I've never heard of <em>Playboy Ultra</em>, although Googling
    it produces some... errr... interesting hits. :^P

  body: This is indeed most likely created customly. If you set up a grid of guidelines
    in Illustrator, this sort of lettering is very easy to create.
