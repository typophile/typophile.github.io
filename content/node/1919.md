  target="_blank">www.method.com?</a>  I&#39;m fascinated by their style and am looking
  to cultivate it myself. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if anyone know of who else I
  can study to get inspiration.  I&#39;m also particularly interested in their type
  choices -- which for the most part seem to be European but I would love it if someone
  could point me in the right direction for more on this style. <BR> <BR>Sativo

  body: I saw method make metion to some typographers a long time ago on an earlier
    version of their site. Must have been like 4 years now. I can&#39;t find that
    mention any more. <BR> <BR>Some of the guys are from MetaDesign SF and their desire
    to do large design programs reinforce that idea.  <BR> <BR>Method seems pretty
    modernist to me so I think that studying Swiss International design and also the
    work of Total Design would yeild some clues too. They have designed type themselves
    for CI. <BR> <BR>Read all the pages at Method including the profiles in the leadership
    pages and other stuff for all the clues you can. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: I don&#39;t get it. I didn&#39;t see anything unique about their &#34;style.&#34;
    It just seems like the same old same old. <BR> <BR>Am I wrong?

  body: Eric, <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not the uniqueness that attracted me, but more the
    signature style.  I think Jon is right in that it has a Swiss International design
    style influence. <BR> <BR>The thing I like about it is that it&#39;s simple, elegant
    &#40;not over stated&#41;, and very functional &#40;using clean and obvious grid
    patterns&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also a style that MetaDesign and perhaps a handful
    of other shops use &#40;all in there own way&#41;. <BR> <BR>As such, I find it
    less ubiquitous overall and therefore more refreshing when done right. <BR> <BR>Besides,
    I&#39;ve been a generalist for all of my career, so I&#39;m ready to make a move
    into another direction.  I think this could be a good way to explore design on
    a deeper level. <BR> <BR>But Jon,  I wasn&#39;t able to find any information on
    Total Design?  What is that? <BR> <BR>Sativo <BR>

  body: Method was founded by some folks that left MetaDesign. That version of Method&#39;s
    site was launched in the Fall of 2001 &#40;If my memory serves me&#41;. It was,
    at the time, on the forefront of that &#39;undesigned&#39; style &#40;it&#39;s
    lack of style has since become a style&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Meta kind of had an identity
    crisis &#40;when everybody else was just having a regular crisis&#41;. I&#39;m
    glad they seem to be back in the saddle. Their recent Adobe packaging and interface
    design is rock solid. <BR> <BR>Here are some of what I&#39;d call &#39;super-rational&#39;
    sites. &#40;Some call it &#39;default systems design&#39; which might apply to
    some of these, but I don&#39;t like the ring of that label.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.metadesign.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.metadesign.com/</a> <BR>Simple, but with some nice
    polish. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank">http://www.pentagram.com/</a>  <BR>Can&#39;t
    decide if I love or hate this, but I can&#39;t deny how the browser becomes as
    important to the design as the white space. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typedifferent.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.typedifferent.com/</a> <BR>B&uuml;ro Destruct&#39;s
    type collection. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.testpilotcollective.com/" target="_blank">http://www.testpilotcollective.com/</a>
    <BR>Once you get past the splash page the site has this undesigned quality.

  body: Thanks All. <BR> <BR>Joseph, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so much looking for the
    minimalist site design -- I&#39;m rather interested in the design solutions Method
    provides for their clients. <BR> <BR>There are some good leads here. <BR> <BR>Anyway
    else intrigued by this Swiss design style? <BR> <BR>Sativo
