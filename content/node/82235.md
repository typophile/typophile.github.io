body: "Hello typophiles!\r\n\r\nI am planning on attending TypeCon this year for the
  second time, and I'm looking for a roommate to make the trip affordable.  I'm a
  24-year-old female graphic designer passionate about all things typography.  \r\n\r\nI
  did my thesis project on educating people about typography through three books I
  wrote and designed about the ampersand, and an interactive ampersand installation.\r\n\r\nMy
  preference would be for a female roommate, but I am open to anyone would might be
  a good fit.  I am open to staying at the Royal Sonesta, a nearby hotel (maybe cheaper),
  or even a hostel.\r\n\r\nYou can check out my personal website here: http://mollymcleod.com,
  and email me at molly.ampersand@gmail.com if you or anyone you know is looking for
  a roommate!\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nMolly\r\n\r\n(Note: I would have posted this in the
  TypeCon forum, but it seems very inactive, so I was worried it wouldn't get seen)."

    looking for a roommate to save a bit of money. I am a 47 year old male graphic
    designer, type designer, typographer/educator. I plan to stay at the Royal Sonesta,
    but I am open to a nearby hotel (cheaper).\r\n\r\nI currently live in Bowling
    Green, Ohio, but I grew up in the South, attended Grad school at CalArts and I
    am currently researching the relationships between Heroic Modernism and Popular
    graphics in the 60s and 70s.\r\n\r\nIf sharing a room with me sounds like a potential
    fit let me know asap!\r\n\r\nbtoddch@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTodd\r\n"
