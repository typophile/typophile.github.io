  body: Hello Mr Lozos, you have classes of the same name defined in the Classes Panel
    as well as in the bottom segment of the OpenType Panel, and in <em>Preferences
    > General Options > Unicode and OpenType</em> have the option <em>Add all glyph
    classes to OpenType feature definition code</em> activated. So either deactivate
    the options or remove class definitions from the OpenType Panel segment.  Karsten

  body: "Mr Larabie, perhaps it is easier to answer your question by describing roughly
    how OpenType feature export works:\r\nFeatures defined in the OpenType Panel and
    text located in the OpenType Panel's bottom field will be merged into a single
    feature definition text file. This file serves as input for AFDKO with which FLS5
    compiles OT layout tables.\r\nIf you have activated the option <em>Add all glyph
    classes to OpenType feature definition code</em>, the Classes Panel's class definitions
    will be converted into AFDKO syntax and included in this feature definition text
    file too.\r\nNow two problems may occur:\r\n<em>(a)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a class
    name is shared by a class defined in the Classes Panel and by a class defined
    in the OpenType Panel's bottom field, and if the <em>Add</em> option is activated,
    then AFDKO  will find two definitions for the same class in this feature definition
    text file, use the later definition, and emit a warning. This means: despite of
    the warning it will compile. You only get in trouble if the content of the identaically
    named classes differs. Then you may end up with too little or too much kerning.
    This is similar to what Mr Lozos experienced. In his case, the classes that shared
    a name were both in the Classes Panel -- the effect is the same though.\r\n<em>(b)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;If
    there are no class definitions in the OpenType Panel's bottom field and the <em>Add</em>
    option is <em>de</em>activated (class definitions from the Classes Panel will
    be ignored), then MakeOTF will complain too -- but this time compilation of OT
    layout tables will fail. This is the case you describe."
