  and Vodafone fonts), but have been googling around for ages and turned up nothing
  anywhere. This font is used on train station signs in London Victoria, London Bridge
  and Gatwick Airport.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gatwick_5384.gif]

  body: "Juergen and Thingy are bang on, it's a typeface called Brunel and is used
    on the dozen-plus mainline stations on Network Rail that are not owned/operated
    by individual train operating companies (TOCs). Rather like its predecessor, Rail
    Alphabet, it exists in positive and negative formats. I have a feeling it is now
    being used on South West Trains stations out of London Waterloo.\r\n\r\nIIRC the
    typeface itself was designed by David Quay on behalf of an agency for Network
    Rail (then Railtrack), the name of which escapes me at present, after the 1994
    privatisation/dismantling of British Rail. The system was nice - each station
    had its own sub-idents within the main branding framework.\r\n\r\nI'll try to
    post more tomorrow... (I'm not on my normal machine).\r\n\r\nBTW, Ben, I'm loving
    your work (and the influences you cite). Got a whole lot of time for Carnet and
    am now enjoying looking at your flickr site. "

    complete pdf of the font does not exist and I think it prudent not have one in
    the current climate of plagiarism. \r\n\r\nThe Tesco font would put me off shopping
    there! I can see there are some resemblances but these maybe just part of a general
    influence of the English tradition that designers such as Jeremy Tankard has also
    tried to achieve in his designs. Jeremy whose I much admire worked at Wolff Olins
    as a graphic designer, we were also doing commissioned for them at this time.
    We seemed to be working in the same area without realising it until later, trying
    to pin down an English approach that had its roots in Granby, Gill and Johnston
    and further back into 19th century sans. I think Jeremy did some work for the
    Heathrow Express which also has this 'Englishness' about it. I think we all achieved
    what we set out to do, Jeremy with his wonderful Bliss and The Foundry with Foundry
    Sterling.\r\n"

  body: "David, I understand your apprehension when it comes to publishing pdfs. Nevertheless,
    it is great to be able to study fine work in detail and seems a shame that genuine
    students, eager to improve, gain knowledge, hone skills etc., suffer because there
    are one or two whose behaviour is utterly reprehensible.\r\n\r\nIt's not the typeface
    that puts me off shopping at Tesco, its the fact that they are or at least seem
    intent on taking over the world. Their logo has needed the 'Miles Newlyn' (viz
    Sainsbury's) treatment for years and always strikes me as having unnecessarily
    large overshoots. (They do a nice Cumberland sausage on their deli although you
    can probably get better at Albert Heijn!)"

    I type and with a nice dollop of Daddies sauce on the side! We don't have such
    good sausages here as it is not part of the Dutch eating culture. Also would make
    a nice name for a typeface!\r\n\r\nIn the near future I intend to include the
    history of our corporate typefaces on my website. I'll make a nice showing of
    the Brunel fonts (Yellow Pages too) and if anyone is interested they can always
    get in touch and I send them a pdf. \r\n\r\nWould be interesting for a student
    to write it all up as a thesis. It was an exciting period for me the 90s, looking
    back I think we all did some great work even though the 'design writer' Emily
    King rubbishes most of it."

    I was misremembering the Tesco font (on inspection I rather don't like the way

    you say about not letting the computer make the compromises to your drawings.
    I've so far been occupied mainly with simple bezier curves drawn straight on the
    screen, but have recently also started drawing by hand and then digitising \u2014
    I know this is a backwards way to learn! I think there's a very different quality
    and level of complexity in hand-drawing (to match the drawn contours properly,
    the curves need more nodes). I find both techniques satisfying and I hope, as
    I develop my own technique, there'll be some interplay between the two."
