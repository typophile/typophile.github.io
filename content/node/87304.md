body: "It bothers me that if I create an OT font, in order for users to be able to
  use the features included, users have to use special software and access some type
  of palette or special window or whatever within that program, and that program has
  to be OpenType savvy.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering lately is, is it still a good thing
  to create a separate font for small caps, or is it better to include the small caps
  into your font as a feature? I wonder because, not everyone uses OpenType savvy
  apps. Some use old software, but they might want those small caps and be willing
  to buy a separate small-caps version of the font. Same thing with dingbats and arrows.
  If you have a separate dingbats file, don't you think you could still sell it as
  a separate font, or is it just time to cram everything into one font and tell people
  about how much is included inside of it? I see so many foundries that do the latter
  and just expect their users to use certain software.\r\n\r\nI'm looking at Office
  2010 in the chart and it hardly supports any OT features! It does not support Small
  Caps, for example. So that's exactly my point and what I was wondering about. Word
  users will freak out if they buy your OT font and can't get all of those features
  to work, right? And if you give them a disclaimer before-hand, they will not want
  to buy it anymore. I really am leaning towards not using features, and creating
  a separate font for Small-caps and dingbats, like font foundries did in the old
  days, and yes, people will have to pay extra to have it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys
  think?\r\n"

    company, it wasn't uncommon for us to get business card \"production-ready\" artwork

  body: "@oldnick. There is a chart on the internet that tells what apps support what
    features, and maybe Office users should look at it and figure out on their own
    that Office doesn't support opentype features very well. I guess you could look
    at it from the point of view that if they don't know Office's capabilities before
    buying your font, it's not your fault.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should just ignore Office's
    shortcomings and expect the users of my font to have better software.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I used to work at Kinko's we had a policy that we would not accept Word or other
    Office documents for printing, because we didn't want to be held responsible for
    the results. We required the customer to create a pdf and we would accept that.
    Later, I worked for a printer and the owner was so desperate for business, he
    would bend over backwards for his customers and accept any type of format. If
    it was a publisher file, he would spend more money on paying me or one of the
    other guys to strip it apart and get it into InDesign than he would ever recoup
    from the customer, who we usually never saw again regardless of how much we invested
    into pleasing them. "
