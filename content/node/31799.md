  body: yes to palatino, but the sans is more like a cross between kabel and futura,
    the sloped finishes to the L, and the straight stroke on the upper case R says
    no to Gill Sans

  body: "Given that they used Palatino for the logotype I'd say Gill is a good match.\r\n\r\n[EDIT:
    And by match I meant educated guess.]\r\n\r\nIt can't be Kabel because the W in
    this weight has its legs crossed. And the R has just enough of a bump in the leg
    and the Z has sharp joins to make me say Gill as well."

  body: just to clarify, i didn't say it was either kabel or futura, just that it
    was nearer to them than gill, it can't be gill, the 'S' is wrong, and there are
    definitely 'kabel-style' slants to the ends of some of the letters

    because is a classic, even though \r\nit was designed a long time ago? \r\nDoes
    it look \"fresh\" according to you or not?\r\n\r\npatty\r\n"

  body: No offense - but I'm not sure Palatino is capable of looking "fresh". Nor
    Gill Sans. It's not a bad logo but I don't see anything distinctive about it at
    all. I'm not sure I'd even call it a logo...

    like a logo to me. It seems more like just a simple sign on a store.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    backwards, like the e in Rotis looks like is falling also). I guess is looking
    at the details that help to sharpen the typographic eye.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\npatty"
