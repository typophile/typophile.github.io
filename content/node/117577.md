  body: "None of the following are dead-on matches, but they all have a similar feel:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/argentina-lian-types/brand/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typejockeys/sauber-script/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lacrosse/\r\n\r\nThe
    original was most likely hand-lettered for Chevy (do I have the right maker?),
    by either their internal art department or the agency that helped market the vehicle.\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the choice of Brand as a substitute. Lavender Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/lavender-script/
    and Shelly Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/ could
    also work. Balladeer Light also has a similar feel even though it is not a connected
    script. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/balladeer/ I also like Citadel Script
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/atcitadel-script/ if the hairline flourises on
    the capitals could be trimmed.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Don, I agree with you on Lavender Script (must have missed that one), but
    the other three look too "engraved" (as in cut with a burin on copper or steel)
    than the more pen-and-ink/brush-and-ink original. '

  body: "Kevin, I was looking mainly at the letter-forms rather than the writing tool
    suggested in the digital font. My idea was that if someone wanted to make a replica
    of the word-mark emblem writing tool details could be blurred out for use in the
    3-D printing process. I agree that they would not work properly if used \"as is.\"\r\nDon"
