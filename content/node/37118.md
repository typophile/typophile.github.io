  time with 91 posts and replies in 10 days. \r\n\r\nA part of me felt proud like
  I'd achieved something important but the strongest feeling was that \"I do not have
  a life beside type & design\". The epiphany came when I realised I thought it was
  alright. I'm a geek and I'm proud;o) So what if I don't have a girlfriend and spends
  most available time outside work doing exactly the same as I did at work. I feel
  like singing James Brown's \"Say it loud...\" but realised it wasn't the right choice:
  It wasn't about type. Typelovers should also have such a song, a sort of anthem.
  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nShare the love;o) "

    spent too much time working on the computer and checking typophile in the meanwhile.
    But you're actually on par with Yves. That is quite an accomplishment. ;)

    a way that is not embarrassing, I will post them. ;)"

    Thanks for asking though. I'm working on 4 things at the same time, I think that
    will sound familiar to everyone. I will do a shoutout or post on the forum once
    it is somewhat finished. :)\r\n\r\nEndre: Yeah, I've heard that before. I don't
    know if it's the other way around for me. I guess so. It's more that I find it
    hard to make the caps fit well with the lowercase. I can imagine that the people
    who start their typefaces with the caps, it can be equally difficult the other
    way around. But I always start with the lowercase first. Plus I have only been
    seriously (attempting) designing type for maybe about a year now. Unfortunately
    I won't have time to [[http://typophile.com/node/37075|work on any typeface]]
    at least until wednesday... Oh well."
