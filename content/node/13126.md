    no one will know the difference. \r\n\r\nDon't worry, I'm not dying to use this
    in my next big design, it's just for comparative purposes. \r\n\r\n\r\nI was thinking
    house, too, but this sucker is just weird. "

  body: "It looks to me like something you could easily 'fabricate' from Eurostile.
    Make the A from an upside-down U; straighten the S and put a new leg on the R.
    From what I saw on the web page link, those three letters might be all it would
    take.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
