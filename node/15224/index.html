<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>In Helsinki, I began thinking about scripts and their origins, and how everyone seems to have their own idea of what "authentic" might mean.
For instance, one designer told me that many Irish have seemed to conclude that Irish-script unadulterated by foreign influence (meaning English influence…) can only be found before 597. But then I thought that the Latin script itself was a foreign import to Ireland, which probably came after 400. So authentic irish script only existed for two centuries… a small window that closed 1600 years ago! And (some) people still long for that today!
Also, a designer of Hebrew types mentioned that there is newfound interest in the writing used on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are almost 2000 years old. Do you have to go that far back to get "authentic" Hebrew?
For Latin, as we use it, I guess we only have to go back to the Italian Renaissance (beginning of U&lc writing and typesetting…)… what's your authenticity date, for anything?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>For Latin, prior to the cancelleresca corsiva hand (Arrighi's corsiva writing manual, <em>La Operina</em>, published in Rome in 1522), you can probably go back to RUSTICA developed from the square Latin capitals, (though "Gallos Fragment" dates rustica to about 22 BC, and suggests rustica probably predates square capitals as a bookhand).
After that I guess Carolingian as mandated by Charlemagne (AD 768?).

<div class=commentbody>Interesting. I beleive that authenticity is linked to the language of the time, that "authentic" script is only considered to be so because writing has evolved into something new, something modern. (until that becaomes authentic.) Determining one point in history when script was authentic is impossible because it's an ongoing evolution.
You can, off course, talk about "Authentic Dead Sea Scroll" lettering, but only because the authenticity is linked to a specific object/time.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm with Kenn, script is a product of its era, it represents a stage of development of a language. To say, for example, that Irish script was unadulterated for two centuries denies any trade links (and subsequently additions to their language) the Irish had, and the arrival of Christianity from 430 AD (although paganism lasted a century after St Patrick's death) which would have added to their vocabulary. Ireland also did not exist as a nation, more as kingdoms built around tribes and confederates, so to talk of an "Irish Script" is disingenuous. So the question of authenticity becomes a question of it being of its time, which leaves the field open to minute subjective inspection with no agreed definite answer.

<div class=commentbody>Authenticity has to be seen as a continuum, I think, and it is inevitably a relative term: a way of making distinctions between forms that are more or less embedded in the continuum. This can also mean different things for different scripts. So when, for instance, I talk about 'authentic Greek', I'm thinking in terms of an historical continuum in which certain details of letterform are present across multiple, historically evolved styles, and contrasting this to a recent and generally Latinised set of design conventions in which these details are missing. When Tom Milo speaks about 'authentic Arabic' he is not talking about details of letterforms at all, but about the fullness of the morphographic system of traditional Arabic writing, as contrasted to the simplified subset of letter interactions dictated by technological limitations of typesetting systems.
The question of 'authentic Hebrew' is an interesting one, because of course what most of us think of as Hebrew letters are actually Aramaic, and were imported into Judaic culture during and after the Babylonian exile. Prior to the exile, the Jews used a structurally identical but visually very different north semitic alphabet that was common throughout Palestine/Canaan, and which most Europeans think of as 'Phoenician' (although 'Ancient Canaanite' is a better term, I think, because it was widely used by different linguistic and ethnic groups, not just the Phoenicians). For a time, following the exile, the two alphabets appear to have been used side-by-side, but by the time of the writing of the Mishna, the Aramaic alphabet had come to be considered the only form appropriate to the writing of sacred scripture, and the old Canaanite script had ceased to be used by the Jews. So the 'authentic' Hebrew letterforms of the Dead Sea Scrolls are imported Aramaic letters, with a non-Hebrew pre-history and a post-exilic evolution that includes the formal square script which most people identify with Hebrew, the Rabbinic hand, and the informal cursive.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The question of authenticity of scripts hinges most on your view of traditions, and secondarily on type-specific issues.
So here are a few generalities.
1. Traditions are greater than any individual in them.
You have great individuals like Louis Armstrong in jazz, or Garamond in type, who seem to define a tradition. But when you look into the history, you always find that though they are great they built on a tradition that was already strong.
2. There are no 'pure' traditions. All traditions have mixed and diverse influences on them. As John explains, the current Hebrew script is a variation on Aramaic, not ancient Hebrew script. The English language is a 'pidgin' or 'creole' French--native speakers of a Germanic tongue who couldn't wrap their minds around French grammar.
3. There are none the less great periods where a tradition gains a power and coherence that has a certain internal logic and force to it. And messing with that internal logic often results in something worse rather than better. To change it in a way that offers new possibilities that are as good as the old is quite difficult. So for example, it is possible to define 'classical' music, or 'dixieland' jazz. Similarly people define 'Geralde' 'Transitional' 'Didone' styles. It is easy to take such styles and change one aspect and have it look much worse. That is because they are well thought though and have a certain internal logic.
4. In spite of the internal logic of a great style, people will always come along and figure a way that does offer new and good possibilities, even though they won't be 'authentic' to the style. Traditionalists will cry foul, and they will be right, but also wrong, because the new style has something to offer. Also because of the on-going creative changes in styles, defining a style like 'classical' or 'transitional' will always be somewhat slippery and tentative.
In sum, there is such a thing as authenticity, and it is valuable. Understanding the 'rules' of a strong tradition is a strength. But violating the rules can also be a good thing, even though most often the result is worse rather than better.

<div class=commentbody>Good thread, good posts.
I would just add that the idea of authenticity, at least to the extent of actual implementation, should be tied more to the future (what the people using that script need) than the past (although of course precedent is central here). Humans don't live in museums, and what is "authentic" can be seen as what helps them remain themselves as a whole, not just in the contextless evolution of their script.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant raises a key question which is how we adapt or change traditions for current or future needs.
I think the idea of 'authenticity' applied to the future doesn't make sense unless we think of some future as inevitable.
This is an Hegelian and Marxist fallacy, which goes along with the idea of an 'avant garde' who knows the wave of the future. The original meaning of 'authentic' is, I believe, that the manuscript was written by the author--an 'authentic' signature etc.--so it originally has to do with the past. More generally it means a lack of pretense, a beautiful quality--but stretching it to apply to the future seems to me to smuggle in the (fallacious) Marxist doctrine.
How best to adapt tradition to the present and for the future is THE question.

Marx. The reason for the certainty--and the claim of scientific status--is that it gave license, in the mind of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, et al to kill in the name of the future ideal world they were certain they would bring about.
Thinking about the future is a key to both security and progress. Thinking 'futuristically' is mainly pretentious b.s.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You have two aspects: The first one is about the culture, history. The second one is about the adjustment. So the question is what do you want to do with that script/with that authenticity: To learn about the history, the tradition? To adjust the script/authenticity?

Huh, sounds kinda familiar... Also, putting Marx and Lenin in the same camp as Stalin is a typical delusional tactic of your party. And once your media stranglehold is broken, you will be left with only the dumbest of the dumb believing you. At which point you better apologize convincingly, or run.

<div class=commentbody>William, I'm not convinced your remarks tying a present or futural sense of 'authenticity' to historical inevitability and clairvoyence is sustainable. The twentieth century 'jargon of authenticity' ties the notion of authenticity to responsible action in the present, which has a future orientation. Authentic action is action responsive to current circumstances and informed by warrented knowledge or grounded understanding.
In contrast to this an authentically irish script might be one for which certain ad hoc variations or norm-violations to an inherited script tradition have become local conventions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>'Authenticity' has become one of those words that has been turned into ideological jargon by some. That I object to. This kind of tendentious stretching of meaning impairs rational discussion. I just stick to the ordinary, dictionary meaning. Cuts through the b.s.
<a href=http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/08/30/marx/print.html>Here</a> is what seems to be a pretty fair recent take on Marx and Lenin on violence.
Since Hebrew is a square script with thick horizontals and thin verticals, and 19th century Ashkenazi scripts already had great thick-thin contrast, what in the world does 'Hebrew blackletter' even mean? </div>

<div class=commentbody>William, does my gloss on 'authentic action' (as action responsive to current circumstances and informed by warrented knowledge or grounded understanding) tendentiously stretch meaning or impair rational discussion or amount to bullshit? What part of my 'authentic action is...' statement is incompatible with the (Random House) dictionary definition of authentic as 1) entitled to acceptence or belief because of agreement with known facts or experience?
I was trying to say that 'authenticity' when applied to <em>action</em> (as Hrant seemed to be doing) might amount to something different than 'authenticity' when applied to <em>scripts</em> (as Dan's original post seemed to be inquiring about).

<div class=commentbody>Peter, I was objecting to the general stretching of the word and the uses to which that has been put. I was not accusing you of trying to impair discussion, and I don't think you were.
However, I do think your defense of the term "authentic action" is not good, and that it is a misleading term. The "future orientation" of your term "authentic action" is not the same as "agreement with known facts and experience," which refers to past events. It additionally involves hypothesizing about the future. If you want to say that an action is a result of thoughtful consideration of its consequences, based on known truths, then the word "responsible" is sitting right there in the English language, and you don't need another term, or to confuse things by using a term with a normally different meaning to it.
'Authentic' originally means that the origin or provenance (the past) of an object is as claimed. The stretching of the term to apply to actions for future goals is pointless and confusing. I understand why it is done. 'Authentic' has come to be used as a term of praise that is supposed to trump every other value--another piece of rubbish. Authenticity is a good thing, but there are more important things, and authenticity and responsibility are not the same thing. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't really understand, but am suspicious of, the idea of 'authentic action' as expressed by Peter. But if I have described authenticity as being related to a cultural continuum -- i.e. to a tradition, a handing-on -- then I think it is necessary to consider what kind of activity, e.g. design activity, might be both authentic <em>and</em> new. Traditionalists have no monopoly on tradition. If, for example, one engages with tradition in a hermeneutic way, seeking understanding, even very radical results can be authentic in the way I use the term: their authenticity coming from the honesty of the engagement. The idea of the authentic is always related to the idea of the true, although the relationship is grasped more quickly in the negative: the inauthentic and the false.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>If, for example, one engages with tradition in a hermeneutic way, seeking understanding, even very radical results can be authentic in the way I use the term: their authenticity coming from the honesty of the engagement.
I also treasure fine work that is a creative response to deep understanding of a tradition--Matthew Carter's historically influenced faces are examples. So as far as substance, I am in agreement with you, John and Peter.
I do object to these uses of 'authenticity' and 'hermaneutics', though, because they are part and parcel of a dishonest and anti-rational campaign to bully people into accepting the odious philosophy of Heidegger, who uses the terms in this way.
Heidegger tried to base ethics on 'authenticity', as a rival to both traditional religious approaches, which do not derive obligations to others from the self, and the Socratic approach of ‘enlightened self-interest,’ which attempts to arrive at obligations to others from a true understanding of social realities. Heidegger tries to spin ethics purely out of the self, it seems. The effort fails, and in the process the notion of 'authenticity' is stretched beyond the breaking point.
When you use 'authenticity' in the Heidegger stretched manner, you are not necessarily endorsing Heidegger's views, but I think it muddies the waters of rational discussion because such uses are 'slipshod extensions' (Fowler's term) of a technical and tendentious term that you may not in fact agree with.
With 'hermeneutics,' the situation is much worse. Hermeneutics originally means the process of analyzing and interpreting the meaning of texts, particularly sacred texts, and does not address the question of truth or falsity of the text. Heidegger and followers extend the concept to analysis of society, tradition, human nature, etc. This Heidegger move slides over onto issues of truth and falsity, the territory of the sciences, and this is deliberate as Heidegger is anti-science.
The effort to build an alternative to science could be fair enough, except that science deals with evidence honestly, and Heidegger and followers deal with it dishonestly. Rational debate about the impact of evidence is the only way to resolve conflicting claims about reality in a way that transcends individual opinion. But doing hermeneutics in the Heidegger style does not brook rational discussion of evidence. The key assumptions of Heidegger are already smuggled into his hermeneutic method of analysis, and it declares itself the only valid method. This is, as Popper noted, a betrayal of the Socratic tradition of critical discussion in the search for the truth.
I observed this bullying, question-begging method at work when my daughter took a college course on literary theory. She was required to compare texts using the prescribed method. But the prescribed ‘hermeneutic’ method already assumed that texts have the primary purpose of imposing the will of the author’s power group on the reader. Actually the meaning of the text was not being discussed, only its political purpose, and that was not even open to discussion.
How is this relevant to authenticity in type design? I think it is misleading to call an honest piece of work that results from study of an historical example but is quite different from it ‘authentic’, as you, John, seem to want to. Galliard is not an authentic digital version of Granjon’s type, and doesn’t claim to be. And a person being authentic, in the sense of honest, free of pretense, is something different than the question of authenticity of a version of an old design. The person can be honest and unpretentious, and the result—Galliard—not authentic yet very good.
To me the conflation of ‘authentic’ and ‘good’ muddies the waters, and implies that violating the authenticity of an original design is bad. I think there is nothing wrong with messing with an old design, providing you are honest about it. The result may well be superior, especially for contemporary needs. Authenticity can be a valuable quality if the original had a strong idea and coherence, as I said earlier. But authenticity is way overrated as a virtue.
Ok, too many words. The Heidegger plague of corruption of language for tendentious purposes really should be squashed, and unfortunately it takes a while to explain why it is so pernicious. </div>

It is because of the Heideggerian connection that I'm suspicious of the idea of authentic action, as I wrote above. My own understanding of hermeneutics follows Gadamer, who of course had studied with Heidegger at one time, but takes what I think is a fundamentally more honest approach in his insistence on the unavoidability of interpretive traditions and the idea of hermeneutics as a collaborative search for truth.
<em>And a person being authentic, in the sense of honest, free of pretense, is something different than the question of authenticity of a version of an old design.</em>
Agreed. But we were not talking previously about authenticity in terms of type design revivals, but of what it means to speak of authenticity in terms of the visual form of a writing system. As I wrote first, I think the latter has to be conceived as a continuum, and not as a singular identity, and the characteristics -- or symptoms -- of authenticity will vary from script to script and depend on their internal qualities. The kind of question Dan is encountering is not about whether Galliard is an authentic Granjon revival, but to what degree either is an authentic form of the Latin script. Of course, both are firmly embedded in the typographic continuum, so there seems little question, but perhaps this is because we have largely forgotten and neglected the diversity of written forms that preceded the dominance of humanist Italian types.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Clearly, when used in connection with historical scripts or present action in the typographic domain, 'authenticity' is a toublesome term.

<div class=commentbody>Indeed. Not only is there a tendency to identify authentic with 'good' -- a natural tendency, I think, considering the identification of the inauthentic with the false --, but when what is under discussion is <em>cultural</em> authenticity the term invites monopolisation: X is authentic, and everything else is false, wrong, bad, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>However, I didn't mean to say (by saying that 'authenticity' is a troublesome term) that reflection about present action in the typographic domain using insights gleaned form serious engagement with the discussions surrounding authentic action in hermeneutical philosphy, crtitical theory or even Hedeggerian existentialism are thereby useless.
I think such engagement could lead to a heightened sense of the importance of:
1) 'originary' action--action 'of / in my own hand' (see the etymology of 'authentic') that inaugurates something important (there are many examples: Legato is a current one)
2) action that engages the past by understanding it and carrying forward what it holds or carries (for example a tacit understanding of the determinants of readability, readerability or the needs of the reader)
3) action reponsive to present needs and future prospects (for example the prospect of optimizing readability through new approaches to contrast manipulation or on-screen rendering)
4) action based on gounded understanding of perceptual processing in reading.
I suppose the point is that an ethic of authenticity needen't be stuck in an obsession with the self and it's 'imperatives' (William, I'm oversimplifying your critique). Thinking that that's all these continental thinkers are after might be an indication that one has not <em>heard</em> what they have to say (through how they say it).</div>
