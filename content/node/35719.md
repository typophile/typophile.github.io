  can't hurt to try, right?)\r\n\r\nI'm an independent software developer (& sometime
  typographer) in the early stages of developing a page layout application intended
  for designing & producing books.  I'd like to get some input from folks who have
  experience designing books with other page layout software.  I have some core features
  that are important to me, but I'd like to hear from other folks.\r\n\r\nSo, if you'd
  to meet for lunch and talk, I'd be pleased.  Since internet access is difficult
  at the hotel, let's just meet outside the main entrance at 1pm.  I'll hang out there
  for 15 minutes or so.  I have a gray laptop bag, and \"John\" on my badge.\r\n\r\n--John"
