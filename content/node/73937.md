body: Hello.  I am new to this site.   Am a prof of art an design at univ of vt.   I
  found you all by googling 'notan'.   I am using the ideas of notan to teach beginning
  design students about the use of space.    am using 'notan' by dorr bothwell, but
  am looking for images and discussion of contemporary work, or clear text.    you
  all have been using these ideas, but all I seem to find is vague references.  I
  am struck by how many visual artists use notan without thinking or knowing it, and
  there is as far as I know, no discussion of the ideas of notan in contemporary painting.  but
  you typophiles are really on it!   its exciting to me.  please send ideas and sites
  for research and image.     thanks.       doodle

    I studied the use of positive and negative space came up in every painting class.
    And I remember elementary childhood art exercises that were nothing but working
    with black and white form.  Just because people don\u2019t get haughty and have
    academic discussions using Japanese terminology doesn\u2019t mean that they haven\u2019t
    been having these conversations for centuries."

    contemporary art is not about material technique, which is mere making.\r\n\r\nOn
    the subject of typography, while text in art has a certain gallery presence, it
    always looks like shit.\r\nEither artists do their own ham-fisted daubs (e.g.
    Ed Ruscha, Ben Eine) -- distress being the limit of their technical facility,
    or they appropriate dreary default fonts (eg. Lawrence Weiner). And then there
    is poor Barbara Kruger, more type-cast than Massimo Vignelli. \r\n\r\nRecently,
    when MOMA curated the \"@\" symbol, it did in fact credit several foundries (if
    not designers) responsible for specific @'s, but there was no discussion about
    the various shapes and forms of the symbol.\r\n\r\nDo curators and critics have
    the vocabulary to discuss technique?\r\nIs it relevant? "

    standards), by the artist.\r\n\r\nWhen Jon Barnbrook did the typography for Damien
    Hirst's \"The Last Supper\", he described Hirst's role as that of art director.\r\nAnd
    how good was the art direction for this trite nutraceutical quip? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GMA_6098.jpg]"
