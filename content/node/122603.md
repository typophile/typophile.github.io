  body: "The \"COFFEE NEW YORK...\" is a bit small and I can't really see if it's
    round or not. The |C| looks round but some other letters like |W|R|K| look like
    they have more sharp terminals.\r\nThe |E|F|Y| look to me a bit different than
    Futura Round.\r\nIf it's really round you can also try <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=JustAnotherFoundry%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=DomusTitling%20-%20Bold&fid=fa7d70be7bcd2c2de4bb0593cefd7570&fsize=60&text=COFFEE%20NEW%20YORK%20CITY&fit=1|Domus

    suggestion of <strong>LL Brown</strong> is the best so far ;)"
