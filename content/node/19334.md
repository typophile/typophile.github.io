  good British band Pure Reason Revolution, and am stumped when it comes to the font
  they use in their graphic profile. Nothing that follows the general lettershape
  of the font has a an A or U like what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nHere's a URL for their
  logo (Hope it doesn't break the forum):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.brick-yard.com/base%20images/library%20images/bands/pure%20reason%20revolution/PPR%20-%20logo250.jpg\r\n\r\nI'd
  be grateful for any assistance, as this band has such an awful offical site that
  a professional fan site is direly needed."

  body: "Ooh, that's so close I can smell it. The top serif of the A isn't wavy enough,
    the R is a bit too pregnant and curtsying and the S a little too complacent.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know of variants on this?"

    target=\"_blank\">Erasmus</a> (likely Light) - both it and Hollandse being S.
    H. de Roos designs (1920's). They're so similar, aren't they, Patty?\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Oops - too late."
