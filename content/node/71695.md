  body: "Hello! I'd be happy to create any sort of specimen for Malabar for you. What
    would you like to have? Should the pages by A4, or a different format. Would you
    like to have the text in English, or another format? If you have a specific text,
    I could use that, too. \r\n\r\nI also wish that the Lino website could give you
    a more typography friendly PDF. But until such updates can be implemented, it
    is a pleasure for me to help on any way that I can. \r\n\r\nAntonio is correct.
    When I began Malabar at Reading, I used the name Martel. But in order for me to
    distribute the face commercially, it was necessary to change the name. \r\n\r\nHow
    can I send the PDF to you? You can send me your e-mail address offline. Mine is
    <em>dan {at} typeoff {dot} de</em>\r\n"

    on Twitter, so you can DM me, too. I am currently on a cross country train, so
    I won''t be able to create and send the PDF for a few more hours. I will get it
    to you today, though. In the mean time, do let me know if there is anything special
    you would like to see on the PDF. '
