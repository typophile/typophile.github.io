  (school of information) Master's Program. It sounds interesting and was mentioned
  during my graphic design class as a possible option for grad school.\r\n\r\nDoes
  any one know about this program? Fab or flop, or somewhere inbetween? \r\n\r\nThanks
  :-)"

  body: Almost everything at the grad level offered at Berzerkley has a good rep (my
    grad school faculty adviser did his PhD there) -- it's hard to believe that this
    would be a dud....
