  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, 

I have a question about Times Roman. I read the old history, and the new history of the typeface. I also read that Apple licence the Linotype version of Times, and in addition they licence Times New Roman from Microsoft who in turn licence it from Monotype.

My question is this: I want to obtain the very best Times. I have an Apple. Is the Times on my Mac the same as the Linotype Times  offered for sale by Linotype? In other words, is the system font 'Times' the same and as high quality as the 'Times offered by the major typeface foundries?

I know there are other alternatives. I have Lido, Nimbus Roman, and plan to buy Starling. 

But if anyone can point me in the direction of the most beautiful 'Times' [and I realise this is an oxymoron for some, as I've read the forum on the pros and cons of Times] then I'd appreciate it.

With apologies for loving 'Times' ;-)

Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, the real Times Roman is from Monotype. Linotype's version can most easily be distinguished from it by looking at the shape of the lowercase italic z; the Monotype version has two straight crossbars, the Linotype one has the lower bar curved.

However, the Linotype version in metal type seemed to me to be just as good in quality as the Monotype version.

Even the authentic versions from the major foundries, though, don't seem to look exactly like the metal type versions. One reason is that they follow the common practice of being based on very large sizes of the typeface - which was optically scaled.

The typeface Times Ten might be worth your consideration.</div>

My concern with the Monotype Times is it's licensing by Microsoft. My understanding is that the Times New Roman bundled with Windows is effectively the Monotype Times, or are there differences between the purchased version and the bundled version. Thus, if I purchase Monotype TImes New Roman would it look just like a standard Microsoft Word document?

Times Ten is under consideration.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The version of TNR bundled with Mac OS is the Windows Vista version, Microsoft licensed it to Apple. Windows 7 includes a newer version, some bug fixes and additional obscure characters. So the one you have is probably fine.

As an alternative how about Font Bureau Starling? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's what Allan Haley of Monotype told me about Times New Roman:

<cite>The spacing and design of the OpenType version of Times New Roman set at 12 point (and the alphabet length) is virtually identical to 12 point Times New Roman set in metal. There are, of course, differences in individual character-pair spacing in some instances, due to improvements made to the general spacing in OpenType fonts and the addition of kerning pairs not possible in hot metal. Overall, though, the spacing is virtually the same. The two versions clearly color out the same. … If you use the PostScript Windows version of Times New Roman, however, the alphabet length is markedly shorter than the standard Times New Roman – and character designs had to be modified to accommodate the new spacing requirements. This is because the design was forced on to the widths of Times Roman from Linotype (the version that Adobe chose to use). “Times New Roman PS” matches the Linotype character widths and spacing, while just “Times New Roman” is true to the original design.</cite>

In addition to Starling, also look at Tiempos Text and Plantin.</div>
