body: "I've been asked to add some glyphs to an open source font originally built
  in FontForge. It's easy enough for me to create my own FontLab source from the shipped
  font, but I want to access the original .fea OpenType Layout code since I don't
  trust FontLab's OT table decompilation. I figured the easiest way to do this would
  be to open the original source in FontForge on my wife's Linux system, figure out
  how to export the .fea code (presuming that this is the sort of thing a font tool
  would enable), and then import that code into my FontLab source.\r\n\r\nAfter a
  lot of cursing of Linux, FontForge and open source in general, having first had
  FontForge refuse to open the font source file (it's described as either corrupt
  or not a recognised file), and then having had the archive extractor 'not support'
  the archive format of the newer version of FontForge that I downloaded (despite
  recognising the file type as an archive), I've given up on that idea.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm looking for someone who works with FontForge who can assist me by figuring out
  how to open the source file and sending me the OTL feature code. Please contact
  me as tiro[at]tiro[dot]com if you think you might be able to help."
