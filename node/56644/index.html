		<div class="commentbody">I was wondering whether it would be problematic to have more than one "standard".
But the round style here throws some light on that issue.
DIN Round is actually very appropriate to several of the original uses of the typeface--where it was "output" by Rapidograph pen (in technical drawings) or router (e.g. signs "engraved" in plastic laminate or stainless steel).
So the variety of styles does not really create more than one standard, it merely represents a single standard as it would appear in different media.
Equally legitimate would be a crude "brush" version of the face, as rendered by a clumsy artisan...

The best way to describe it would be to say it’s probably the same as Highway Gothic in the USA - a relatively recent design that has been placed in the public domain. That's not to say individual interpretations (eg Interstate) are not protectable.

Because the font is, like, so 2007 ;-)

Getting back to what Nick said earlier, it does feel pretty wacky that a <em>standards</em> face such as DIN gets rehashed, resampled and replayed <em>this</em> much… (Although I don't actually dislike it; there's just… a lot of it recently.)

Mikey, agree re the wobbliness. (And it's Not Good when DIN of all things wobbles.) Does the hood of that fat "a" up there look a bit wonky?

True, probably. I just think it's ironic that a "standard face" &ndash; and I use the term not in the sense of the font having become a de facto "standard" because it's so popular or something, but in the sense that it was originally introduced/designed as a standard compliant font for certain defined contexts &ndash; is now a starting point for so many variations. 

But I guess that's human. It reminds me of how here in Switzerland, the original Swiss Army bicycles have become pretty popular, even though they have one gear, they're old, heavy as hell and also uncomfortable. But they're cool for some reason, and people buy, mod and paint them. </div>

1) Trademark

The trademark "DIN" was registered at the German Patent Office in 1920.

See the website http://www.din.de, where this is said in German: <cite>"1920 DIN wird als eingetragener Verein beim Amtsgericht Berlin gemeldet. Geschäftsstelle ist in der Sommerstraße 4a. Das DIN-Zeichen wird als Warenzeichen beim Patentamt registriert."</cite>

2) Design

The design of the DIN typeface is older than 25 years. Therefore according to the German design ("Geschmacksmuster") law this typeface design is already in public domain.

I will not be surprised, when I learn that another ripoff foundry grabs Linotype's clone and sells it as "DIN Ultra-Next".

By the way:

Fontshop tried to grab the trademark "DIN", but did not succeed:

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/FF-DIN-1.jpg

and www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/FF-DIN-2.pdf

The above German legal gibberish means that the illegal Fontshop registration of the trademark "DIN" was annulled by the registration office.

Second, according to your link/pdf, the DIN institute had objected to FS's registration (the "widerspruch") so I guess that FS decided to withdraw it ("anmeldung zurückgenommen"). This however does not make FS's application "illegal" as you write, it was just not successful. Business as usual.
Interesting though that the DIN institute registered the bildmarke but forgot to register the wortmarke, isn't it?

		<div class="commentbody">As i was the one who asked Albert "Din" Pool to design FF DIN back in 1995, i need to explain my reasons:
I had noticed a trend to use apocryphal typefaces, i.e. those that don't have a designer in the real sense. DIN was designed by a committee of engineers, first in the 20s, and then again a few times over the years. In the early 60s, Günter Gerhard Lange from Berthold sat on the DIN committee and was responsible for bringing a little more real design into the very technical drawings that had been executed using t-squares and compass only. You can see the Berthold influence in the S and a few other characters, which owe a lot to Akzidenz Grotesk, itself a kind of standard in Germany at the time (and sold as Standard in the US).

The DIN Mittelschrift as released by Adobe/Linotype was a digital version of these rigid engineering drawings. Albert's brief was to take the regular weight and subtly make it a good typeface. He did it so well that it looks exactly like the original, but much better, especially in smaller sizes. Albert also added weights, and that not only made the face usable for designers, but also showed that he is a very good type designer. FF DIN looks as if DIN had always had those weights because Albert didn't let his ego interfere with the job. The new "old" design answered the need for a neutral "undesigned" typeface and has since become a favourite of designers around the world, even in places where nobody connects it with the signs on the German Autobahn.

Akira took a different approach because Albert's interpretation of the original in the public domain could not be improved. He didn't set out to improve the original, but designed his own interpretation. There is no reason why designers shouldn't use one as well as the other – they're different enough.</div>

I don't think that <cite>"business as usual"</cite> correctly describes the invalid registration of the acronym DIN. Let's assume, American lawyers try to register the acronyms USA, CIA and FBI as trademarks. Is this <cite>"business as usual"</cite>?

Sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot possibly admit anything about this, because trademarks are not my field of work at FSI.

Now that you have posted English screenshots, you'll surely notice they don't say anything about "grabbing" trademarks, "invalid" or "illegal registrations" (whatever that may be), or registrations "being annulled". Karsten also gave you some hints to "nuances" in wording that you didn't get right.</div>

I'd say it's just another business strategy for Linotype to dig some people's deep pockets deeper.

The black "a" in the first picture reminds me of Stag Sans while the rounded harks back to a Lineto typeface (I forgot its name).

I can't find details on DIN Next LT Pro, but when I google DIN Next, it's most of the links that come up!
 
LT could mean Linotype??

Also, they apply the "LT" and "Pro" to the actual font name that shows up in the system instead of just leaving it as DIN Next? Very confusing!

Also, a company a do some work for says their font is FF DIN, on their workstation I found a folder labeled FF Din Font Family...but...then the actual fonts are named "DIN Medium" and "DIN Black" and "DIN Alternate Light"...no FF in sight, and there's 17 not 20.

I'm new to discovering and playing with fonts but I love it. Just find it to be...messy...a lot more than I'm used to in other areas of design.  </div>

@Nick Shinn: My take is that the ‘template’ lettering you talk about is not part of the DIN-family discussed here, but the type that is commonly known as Isonorm. (I used the MecaNorma transfer-version of that for one of my first letterheads, around 1980.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you everyone, I think I've got things organized now. I found another folder that is titled DIN FF (looks like an old school icon).

But I have one more question... The names. The last guy who was here apparently passed these through software to convert them to OpenType TT fonts. It added hyphens in the filename as well the actual font data name (whatever that's called).

In the past, I've experienced issues of "missing fonts" on other computers because someone along the line had altered font names from the standard.

Can someone who has these please assist me with the correct naming convention for these? Am I being too anal? The first set of 5 are "grouped as DIN while the rest are all individual. How should they be grouped? Should I just buy the whole set over again, my God what a mess... 

Here's what I have to work with:

DIN-Black.ttf
DIN-BlackItalic.ttf
DIN-Bold.ttf
DIN-BoldItalic.ttf
DIN-Light.ttf
DIN-LightItalic.ttf
DIN-Medium.ttf
DIN-MediumItalic.ttf
DIN-Regular.ttf
DIN-RegularItalic.ttf
DINCond-Black.ttf
DINCond-Bold.ttf
DINCond-Light.ttf
DINCond-Medium.ttf
DINCond-Regular.ttf

Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>completeness</strong>
That makes 15 fonts I’d say. Nothing is really missing although you also might want to have the 5 weights of  [[http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_DIN|FF DIN]] Condensed italic, as well as the 5 weights of [[http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_DIN|FF DIN]] Round which were added in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Provided that the software you are working with supports stylistic alternates (like InDesign, Illustrator etc.) one could consider to buy the OpenType versions to have automatic access to all alternates simultaneously as well as all four sets of figures.

<strong>Font names</strong> 
Advice on how to name the fonts is an expert issue. What you need basically depends on how the font software you are using supports the input of names into the OpenType format, what names (and/or styles) your applications support and how you would like to handle italic, bold and bold italic (basically through style buttons or through the menu together with the other weights). The OpenType format allows an additional level of grouping weights into font families. FontFont TrueType.ttf and OpenType.otf behave differently when it comes to names and styles. 
Three points of concern:
– I am not shure wether your license allows you to convert these fonts into another format.
– Your way of renaming the fonts might be incompatible with later additions such as condensed italic weights or future additions to the family.
– Font conversion may have resulted in corrupt data (name tables, missing kerning pairs, characters with corrupted or missing encoding.

<strong>FF DIN vs DIN Next / Garamond vs ITC Garamond / etc.</strong>
I support Erik’s view on DIN Next. DIN Next is to DIN what ITC Garamond is to the original typefaces by Garamond. Rather soft, round, not really faithful to the original. To take this a little further: PF DIN is to DIN what Monotype Garamond is to the original typefaces by Garamond. As if seen through someone else’s glasses (mine/Jean Jannon’s), many funny details that have nothing to do with the original as well as a missing design for – resp. a strange view on – what is needed for smaller sizes.

<strong>to Nick (DIN for engraving)</strong>
Alphabets for engraving have been a substantial part of the DIN 1451 standard from the very beginning. It seems that comittee originally intended to create one design which could then be executed in different media. Probably due to having to live with what was already available (the Prussian Railways typeface and various typefaces for engraving machines) this goal was never really achieved. On the other hand, it is likely that DIN Mittelschrift (for which it seems that there was no Prussian Railway template was available) has been based on the Normograph lettering style by Georg Bahr (not to be confused with the architect with the same name). Read [[http://issuu.com/fontfont/docs/ff_din_round|FF DIN Round – digital block letters]] for more information on this subject.
The Isonorm 3069 typeface has been designed in such a way that it could easily be made fit for single-line engraving (hence the rounded stroke ends). The design of Isonorm 3096 has nothing to with the typefaces of DIN 1451 though.

<strong>DIN Schriften typeface package</strong>
The typeface package by Linotype / Adobe not only contains DIN Engschrift and DIN Mittelschrift, which more or less resemble the version of DIN 1451-2 from 1980 (including the wrong interpretation of lowercase of DIN Engschrift which has the bowl of the a starting with a curve, which is a clear mistake). The other two typefaces in that package are DIN Neuzeit Grotesk light and DIN Neuzeit Grotesk bold condensed. These are adaptations of Neuzeit Grotesk which were proposed as a model for lettering on industrial products through DIN 30640. It is likely that Siemens has been behind this because they have been using Neuzeit Grotesk in their corporate design from the 1930ties until the 1970ties. DIN 30640 has been withdrawn because it lacked acceptance within the industry.

<strong>Licensing DIN 1451?</strong>
The [[http://www.din.de|DIN institute]] does not act like a type foundry that sells fonts or licenses designs. When it comes to DIN 1451 they only sell the standard sheets. As a result, manufacturers such as Berthold, Bitstream, Linotype, Adobe and URW as well as many suppliers of foil-cutting, embossing and engraving machines (used to) produce their own drawings, templates, stencils and digital data. Seen in this perspective, no typefoundry or manufacturer ever licensed the ‘original’ DIN typeface. It is the various versions designed / produced / marketed by the various designers / manufacturers / foundries which may each be subject to copyright / trade mark laws and other legal issues.</div>
