body: "Hey everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm back with a new question about typography. I recently
  ran into an offer at my local Apple store wich offers the massive Adobe Font Folio
  collection for 400 bucks (360 \u20AC) till the 31 of August. I was thinking of making
  the purchase as it really is a massive cut to the price tag but here's the question
  : is it worth it? What do you think of Adobe fonts and this package in general?
  Do you think I should go for it?\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me your opinions freely,\r\nPierluigi"

  body: Heck yes. $400 is the cost of just three or four font families and Adobe's
    got plenty of good ones. Even if you end up only using a TINY portion of the fonts
    on the disk, you'll have gotten a bargain.

    edition. Buy ten and sell them on eBay."

  body: "\u20AC360??! That is one TENTH of the normal price. I wouldn't be certain
    it would be a legit licence at that price. In asia you can get the full boxes
    of Adobe and Fontshop collections for peanuts \u2013 totally pirated of course,
    but still in boxes were it can be difficult to spot if it's a fake, except for
    the price."
