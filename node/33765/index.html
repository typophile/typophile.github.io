  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm a little stuck. My client has chosen "Engravers Lt" for a logotype for a restaurant that we're working on. Not a choice I would've made, but since it was one of the suggestions I gave, I'd be happy to roll with it and work with it. 

The look we're going for is classy (where have you heard that one before), contemporary, but not too formal, stuffy or otherwise fuddy duddy. 

Now I need to find a matching "text" face  to go with it. He has a preference for serif faces, but I'm open to both. I have suggested Neutraface to contrast with Engravers and to give the identity a modern edge. 

I am looking for something that is 
-slightly broad (like engravers), 
- something with both old style and lining figures and also 
- small caps. IS that too much to ask?

I have tried Goudy Old Style, Mrs Eaves, Adobe Caslon. But it seems like none of them are working very well. Mrs Eaves small caps is ok but the rest of it looks too "pretty" for this quite androgynous or even "masculine" look we have going. 

On the bright side, we're not really setting prose, so it does not need to be *too* readable. Just namecards and menus.

Any suggestions at all would be welcome. 

Thanks!

Some of these are not what I would call "contemporary", but that term is a far cry from Engravers, so I went with the best fit for the type you are working with. Scotch romans, text didones, sharp serifs, and a few contemporary faces that share characteristics of those.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Steph, 
Thanks for your suggestions! 

> Some of these are not what I would call “contemporary”, but that term is a far cry from Engravers,

Exactly what I told the client. "Contemporary" is not equals to what he chose. But I supposed ever since the genre got mixed up with luxury goods, it became somewhat associated with being modern, classy and "contemporary". 

So now, I'm taking a step back and trying to see through his eyes. How something like "Engravers" is contemporary, and how to use it as if it was "modern" and "contemporary".

Actually, I made a mistake, he chose AT Sackers. 

I first looked  at Luxury, and I really liked Diamond, etc, so I chose a poor man's version — engravers and gave Sackers as an option.

The client liked the funky "C" in Sackers. I have MAJOR MAJOR problems with the Sackers "R". And also the contrast. It's not nearly as high contrast as engravers, which I kinda prefer. But the serifs in Engravers, I find too pronounced. 

So now I know what exactly we're paying for when you dish out $$$ for Luxury. 

But first, I'll check out all your suggestions!!!

As Carter says, it has a certain timeless grace. The x-height is a
little big though. And the "f" needs fixing (sorry, Chris Costello).

> I have MAJOR MAJOR problems with the Sackers “R”.

Would the client pay to have it changed?
If so, let me know.

Would Farnham work with this?

Hey Hrant, there won't be any budget to fix anything professionally. If there were, it would be nice to get it redrawn. I'll have to think of a low-cost way to fix it.
