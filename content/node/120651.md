body: I'm working with classes in my font to kern the font faster and more efficiently,
  but for some reason some classes aren't working. For example, I have to kern all
  my /a/s manually rather than kerning all /a/s at once. The /e/s are grouped though.
  I have the feeling things particularly go wrong when I have the base letter kerned
  before I apply the classes. What am I doing wrong?

  body: "Yes, I have. For some reason it doesn't always accept the first character
    as the master. Here's an example of my kerning classes:\r\n_a: a' aacute acircumflex
    adieresis agrave atilde aring\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kerning
    class_5695.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe kerning classes are working for /e and /o, but not
    for /a. I have to kern each instance of /a manually. It's not the only class that
    doesn't seem to be working though."

  body: Also, is it possible to put in numbers for the sidebearings and kerning rather
    than dragging guides? Right now I drag everything, and sometimes there's a slight
    difference in spacing between two instances of the same letter with different
    accents. I think I should be working more accurately. I'm kind of surprised I
    can't edit the parameters of the kerning classes (the width and space on both
    sides).

    Have you remembered to click the \"Accept\" button after making any changes or
    additions to a class? It might be helpful if you posted a shot of your classes
    panel, showing the _a class.\r\n\r\nTo your second question, click the third-last
    icon at the top of the Metric window (\"Expand the window\") it will reveal a
    table the sidebearings and kerning info for each glyph in whatever text you have
    active in the window. You can select the figures in the table to change them.\r\n\r\nTo
    change sidebearings and advance widths you need to set up metrics classes separate
    from the kerning classes.\r\n\r\nThe FontLab manual can be daunting but it is
    your friend, you just need to dig into it. Check the sections on Class-based Kerning
    and Metrics Assistance."

    know, but to be honest with you I've consciously been avoiding it. This might
    sound sad, but I lead a pretty isolated life, and needing help is just a nice
    excuse for me to get in contact with people. I rather ask here than refer to the
    manual. I do have the manual in case no one can help me here."

  body: Okay, I got used to this logic now. It just took a bit to properly switch.
    However, I seem to have a persisting problem. Now all accented /a characters are
    linked to the master character, except for aacute. I still have to kern that one
    manually. I also removed the class, set the kerning of both characters to 0, re-created
    the class and kerned /a, but aacute didn't move with it; the other characters
    do.

  body: You may have inadvertently created a kerning exception for the aacute. You
    can get a list of all kerning pairs by choosing "Table" from the "Options" pop-up
    menu at the bottom of the Metrics window. It displays a list of kerning pairs
    in a spreadsheet-like table on the right side of the Metrics window. You can select
    and delete kerning pairs from that table.

    with the master character now.
