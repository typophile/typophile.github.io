  design company called 13, one particular face I think is custom, most of the fonts
  in the book are mentioned, this one isn't, if it is custom, can anyone recommend
  any similar fonts?\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\nhttp://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk25/leewilson78/art.jpg\r\nhttp://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk25/leewilson78/ei.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso,
