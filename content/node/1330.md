  body: I think the font is Adobe&#39;s &#34;Conga Brava&#34; in one of its medium
    weights.

  body: Hrant -- Out of curiousity, why do you say &#34;figures&#34;? Michael Harvey&#39;s
    work does have a certain flavor, but this version used isn&#39;t very indicative
    of this flavor.

  body: It &#34;figures&#34; that I like it - since I like Harvey&#39;s stuff. But
    I guess you don&#39;t think Conga Brava is typical of his style? Maybe you&#39;re
    right. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I do think Conga Brava is very Michael Harvey, only this weight which you
    asked for an id on isn&#39;t so. But, that isn&#39;t why I asked. I was gonna
    have to hurt you if you were insulting him. ;^D  <BR> <BR>Why do you like his
    work? I like his work because the hand is so very apparent. And I can also picture
    his stone work from his type designs.

  body: '&#62; Why do you like his work? <BR> <BR>Dunnno - good question. <BR>His
    stuff is very craftsmanlike. <BR>But maybe I&#39;m also influenced by his endearing
    character. He strikes me as the sort of person who <i>could</i> get away with
    being haughty and old-fashioned, but he&#39;s the exact opposite. <BR> <BR>hhp
