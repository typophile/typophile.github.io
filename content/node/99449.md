body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for this particular font for the sign company i work
  for.\r\n\r\nNotice the symmetrical weight of the letters and the absence of serifs
  on top. That should narrow down the search a bit.. I have already tried Whatthefont,
  but no luck. I only have a few letters. Any clue anybody? Any help greatly appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_8016_5342.JPG]"

  body: "Can be wrong but as pointed out, this looks too much symmetric to be a font
    to me, more a hand-lettering. The apparent effort to make strokes equally thickened
    is weird too. They may even have started with strokes, creating the sans backbone
    then adding serifs. You could also try to rework [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Trajan|Trajan]],
    cutting and mirroring some strokes.\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Penumbra+serif|Penumbra
    (Half) Serif]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/monkton|Monkton]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Weiss|Weiss]],

  body: "Ryuk, seems like you could be right. Either this, or they mirrored some existing
    characters.. I've looked at the alternatives you suggested and will try to put
    something together based on these. (I have to produce additional letters to an
    existing text).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"
