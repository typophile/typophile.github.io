    caps, I didn't recognize it right off the bat (I initially assumed it was a Hoeffler
    & Co. or Font Bureau release).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I suspect the poster is silkscreened (it's signed and numbered, and the type
    overprints the image), so it's going to look a bit more hand-made than a commercially
    printed piece.\r\n\r\nHate the process, not the typeface...."
