  body: <a href="http://www.fontagent.com">FontAgent Pro</a> will do it and much more.
    But there probably are free apps that will do only the catalog printing if you
    search for "font print" at <a href="http://versiontracker.com">versiontracker.com</a>.

  body: Look for Font Book at Versiontracker.com, I'm pretty sure that might help.
    But, Stephen is right, FontAgent is a better alternative.
