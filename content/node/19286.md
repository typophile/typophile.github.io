    find a lot of well known logo's with explanation in the catalog.\r\n\r\nhttp://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/index.htm\r\n\r\nBest,

  body: "The identity for Langoed T' Ross by Studio Dumbar remains my favorite system
    to-date. They've won awards for it. Not really a logo per-se, but  an aphrodisiac
    for your eyes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.studiodumbar.nl/site/main.html\r\n"

    Hate the nav and the images are so small. That Langoed identity does look gorgeous
    if only one could see it!
