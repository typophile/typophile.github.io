  body: The italic r, p and g suggest some flavor of Caslon, perhaps one of Mergenthaler
    Linotype's versions...

    Old Style Italic</a>. The stubby 'f' strongly suggests this is the Linotype version
    of the font, and of course the digital version is spidery and thin compared with
    the book size printed on paper with ink spread, like all of the worst of the Monotype
    digitizations, but otherwise it looks like a match to me.

  body: "In looking at the Old Style samples in the \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\"
    by Jaspert, et al. I do not see a good match for the 'f' in either the Monotype
    or Linotype versions that are shown. The 'r' looks most like the Monotype version,
    and in looking at the full page sample, I found a Roman 'g', and it looks more
    like the Monotype Old Style 'g'.\r\n\r\nThe italic 'f' still seems to be a problem,
    for none of the samples, including an old Linotype catalog from the '30's shows
    anything quite like it. BTW, Old Style No.7 in the Linotype catalog had a rather
    narrow 'f', but not this narrow, and the Roman 'g' was not so close, and the italic
    'r' was not as much like a 'v'. The narrowness of the italic f in your sample
    is not quite like any samples I could find.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I also spent a fair amount of time staring at some of the Baskerville metal
    type samples, which had somewhat similar italics, but I think some version of
    Old Style seems likely to be the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Raph,\r\n\r\nThat looks like a match indeed. Even the fi ligature looks the
    same, with the lower part cut. I presume the digitization was made from a larger
    size, which would partly explain why it seems thinner. I also presume the smallcaps
    were taken from a smaller size. Is our current notion of smallcaps an invention
    of the digital age?\r\n\r\nMichel"

    at all, this convention has been around a long time for book printing. SC letters
    were often a part of the serif text families, and the letters were specifically
    designed for that size, not just re-scaled.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
