body: "I just received a design piece for the 2007 How Design Conference that will
  be held June 10-13 in Atlanta, GA\r\n\r\nThey are offering workshops/lectures from
  \"Can't We All Just Get Along\" to aspects of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
  Color Trends, even a Gloss-n-Floss Font workshop.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone
  here was giving any of the 49 sessions and 11 workshops?\r\n\r\nAnyone planning
  on attending?\r\n\r\nHas anyone been to the HOW conference in previous years? If
  yes, what were they like?\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, they of course, give a website
  to visit - howconference.com"

  body: "I have attended the last 3 How Conferences. It can be hit or miss. Some great
    designers are not necessarily great speakers. I think it is still worth going,
    as you can meet some great people. The resource center and bookstore are also
    great. I have picked up a lot of back issues of HOW and Print for cheap and tons
    of free paper samples.\r\n\r\nThe conference is very busy, it sold out the last
    2 years, and they always pick a city that has ungodly heat.\r\n\r\nDon't overbook
    yourself. Allow some free time to explore the city and just rest. The optional
    studio tours are okay, but after a while it got repetitive.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
    forward to Chip Kidd and Deborah Sussman speaking at this year's conference.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also go to forum.howdesign.com and go to the Design Events and Lounge section
    to meet people (like me) who are going."
