  with. Just the image. It's probably from mid 70's but could be wrong. They have
  been using the logo for a long time. They have it on their website.. but it's even
  smaller.\r\nAny ideas?\r\nThanks!\r\n-Matthew"

    you customize the 'e' (a little cut & rotate) could be perfect ;-)\r\n"

    I've been keeping an eye out for a font that was a match minus the 'e'.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "fvilanadis.. Thanks for the squirrel.. but I had to do that by hand.. they
    also wanted a version that looked hand-inked. It's one of my specialties. The
    font for the logo is just an operational necessity. I have to reproduce EXACTLY
    what they have.. then propose a more modern update.\r\nThanks though, I never
    would have expected that to be in a font!\r\n-Matthew"
