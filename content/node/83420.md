body: Anyone using CAD software for type design? I just started some letterforms in
  Rhino and I'm loving the n.u.r.b.s curves for forming counters. I think I'll only
  be using Rhino for a head-start; bezier curves in Illustrator will be best for fixing
  optical details. But for now I'm pretty excited to see what this can do for me,
  it's really fun. Anyone else using CAD software to jump-start their designs?
