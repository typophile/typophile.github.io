  For the text? The captions? The page headings? Thanks!

  body: 'Hard to tell from a small sample, but perhaps Baskerville? <BR> <BR>Edit:
    There are a ton of Baskerville digitizations out there - I have Monotype Baskerville
    but I noticed this new one, called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-baskerville/"
    target="_blank">John Baskerville</a> which seems very complete.'

  body: I agree that it looks like Baskerville, but the clincher would be to see a
    Q.  I&#39;d guess in that time period the Monotype might have been the model for
    most of them, but I think every foundry had their own versions. You are talking
    about metal type, remember, probably set by something like a Linotype or Monotype
    typesetting machine. <BR> <BR>A look at McGrew might give a good idea what was
    in use.

  body: Thanks. Also, what about the sans serif font that&#39;s there? Anyone have
    an idea what that is?
