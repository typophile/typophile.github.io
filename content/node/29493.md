    for exploration. The bad news is that virtually all of the exploration is done
    for the sake of style, not function.\r\n\r\nOne of my type design students -a
    graffiti artist, appropriately- did a unicase stencil font. I tried to guide her
    as much as I could, and I think the results were interesting and useful, but I
    have to admit to having felt a little bit lost! More thought is needed, all around.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Forma has very thin support bars, and many are positioned such that the counters
    could easily be torqued out and broken away, most obviously in the A, B, D, P,
    O, Q, and R. In the lower case, the a, b, d, e, g, o, p, and q have the same problem.
    The curved support bar of the A is unusual, but not prohibitive depending on the
    method and material of construction, but most ways I can think of it it only serves
    to further weaken the bar.\r\n\r\nA stencil made with this font would work, but
    it could be easily damaged and is therefore not suitable for repeated use. It
    would depend on the material and size of the stencil and the conditions under
    which it is used. The counters are attached, but in such a way that they're still
    floppy, and that is dangerous when designing a sturdy, functional stencil.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to put together a little image of some other stencil fonts, like Freeform
    721 and Glaser Stencil and whatever else I can find so we can further the discussion.
    It seems most if not all stencil fonts take some liberties with what I imagine
    stencil engineering to be."

  body: "Rui, \r\n\r\nIf we do want to distinguish between a design that can be translated
    into a reusable stencil, and a stylistic exercise, then I think your design is
    the latter. The locations of the 'interruptions\" as you call them are less than
    optimal if you consider making and using a stencil from it. Some letters might
    need to be completely redesigned if your real goal is reusable stencils. \r\n\r\nI
    have made stencils, and some were only intended to be used 2-4 times and then
    thrown away. In one case I made a house number, and held the small counters to
    the rest of it by taping long pieces of hair across the whole thing (my sister
    has very long hair). So you could even make a stencil that doesn't look like one.
    For that matter, silkscreen printing is essentially a stencil held together by
    a fine mesh of \"hairs\", or the thin threads of the screen. \r\n\r\nBut what
    is your goal, and what are your real constraints? If the design isn't meant to
    ever be translated into physical materials, then why bother? You could make a
    font with interruptions all over, or one with dents and bumps, or.... If the real
    constraints of making a functional stencil aren't there, then why are you doing
    it? If you want to play with that style, I say make it work for real. The big
    challenge is making it work and look good. \r\n\r\nFinally: To see if your design
    works as a stencil, print it on heavy card, take a knife and cut it out. Spray
    paint or sponge paint something with it. Does the card curl up? Do the links dissolve
    from the moisture in the paint? Are they too delicate to withstand blotting or
    brushing? Use plastic. Does the paint get under the counters? There are a number
    of other concerns with designing real stencils that might be more interesting
    than any of our theories. What about trapping? "

    suppose my intention was to make a print font with style rather than a real stencil
    font, although when I was working on in it i was imagining it to be cuted on a
    iron plate.\r\nAfter releasing it I started questioning my self whether thise
    characters were just nice drawings  with a light stencil touch (i don't know if
    you agree), or if this font could be considered as a stencil font. That is why
    I wanted to bring to discussion \"the stencil aproach\" and it is making me want
    to add a new version to forma with real functional concerns."

    means that there can be no such things as \"too thin\" and \"broken away\". There's
    a lot of fertile ground between making anything mean anything and being hopelessly
    draconian. The potential physical merit of a stencil font is completely pointless.
    So a given one might be unsuitable depending on the construction material, the
    type of paint, etc.? What else is new about fonts?!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    graffiti, signage, tags and other applications that call for inventive letters

    only with stencils, as well as political graffiti. Portable, quick, no need for
