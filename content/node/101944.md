  official test-prep for GRE and (most likely) on the actual GRE exam. My whole future
  is dependent on my GRE score, which in turn relies on me switching all prep materials
  into this test font for greater familiarity.\r\n\r\nI tried many Serif fonts with
  Microsoft Word, but to my eyes, they all seem a little chubbier and shorter than
  this one. I don't know if this has to do with screen resolution or anything else.\r\n\r\nThank
  you again. You'll be my hero.\r\n\r\nEric[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NEED
