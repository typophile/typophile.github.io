body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nSo I found this wonderful font, called Nautilus.  Downside is, it's
  a paid font.  I was looking to use it for a school project but as it is for school,
  I would use it only once.  I'm not saying I don't want to support the type-maker.
  I do. But it's just some brief detailing.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone could
  help me identify similar fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/nautilus.html"

    fonts, but you may find some interesting typefaces at google.com/fonts (set the
    category filter to \"Display\").\r\n\r\nGoogle fonts Modern Antiqua and Metal
    Mania, for instance, have a similar vibe, even if they aren't a match to Nautilus.
    \r\n\r\nIf you search free font sites using the terms \"Steampunk,\" \"Heavy Metal,\"
    or \"Pirate,\" you may find something closer in style to Nautilus. Just be aware
    that many of the fonts you will find will be unauthorized copies of commercial
    fonts.\r\n\r\nIf you can see fit to spend $20 instead of $30, this font (using
    its stylistic alternates) comes close:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/sheepman/"
