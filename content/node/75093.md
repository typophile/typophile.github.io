body: "Archer is a lovely typeface, but here in Sweden it have gone too popular, especially
  in magazine design. Pretty much every other lifestyle-cover in the stands have Archer
  on it. So here I am, with my first post on Typophile, asking you for great alternatives
  to Archer.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for slab-serifs with a classy och and soft feeling.
  Great span of weights, from hairline to black, is qualifying.\r\n\r\nI like [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/jubilat|Jubilat]],
  but it haven't any hairline. [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/charlie|Charlie]]
  is also quite nice.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    Less playful, four text weights, many display options.
