body: Anyone willing to share some good sample texts/layouts for testing fonts? I
  found some really nice kerning strings from Typophile archives, but I'm thinking
  about a tool to help in DESIGNING special characters (such as /ampersand, /section,
  /slash, guilsings, /dagger, /emdash, etc.), something that will help to test all
  special glyphs against normal text, in their "natural environment" so to say. I
  have understood that many font designers have built their own Indesign layouts for
  this purpose?
