  etc. that are often found on very old labels and ads around 1900?\r\n\r\nDo these
  have a particular name? If they're just an added bonus with some typefaces, can
  someone recommend a few to look at?\r\n\r\nI found this: http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/noelsthesands.php
  but would like some more options. \r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    Words JNL]], whilst FontFont do [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/catch-words/|FF
    Catch Words]]. There's also the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers/word-logos/|Brothers

  body: Adobe Wood Type has them, and Phaeton has many more, in several languages.
    I believe briarpress.org, a letterpress site, also has some actual wood type designs
    in vector form to download.
