  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a somewhat newbie to the world of typography - hence the eventual question - but have always been an admirer of fonts and their uses in everyday mediums. I&rsquo;m currently studying graphic design, and on my holidays have taken up some time to do some extra research on type classification because, well I just like it! Anyway, I&rsquo;m reading about Humanistic/Venetian typefaces, and how that led the way to Old Style typefaces which were less calligraphy based and more refined etc. However, in half of the articles I read online, they refer to the Humanist typeface phase as being labelled &lsquo;Old Style&rsquo;&hellip;. so I&rsquo;m naturally confused a little right from the get-go. Is this just a result of the proximity and chronological order of these two styles blending into one another in some people&rsquo;s eyes, or is there an obvious distinction or answer to this that I&rsquo;m completely oblivious to?</p>
<p>Any kind of clarification will be very much appreciated. I really want to grasp this stuff as it interests me greatly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The term &ldquo;Humanist&rdquo; has more than one meaning in typography.</p>
<p>The earliest Old Style typefaces were based on a manuscript hand to which the term &ldquo;Humanist&rdquo; was applied. But that term is not applied to <em>those</em> typefaces.</p>
<p>Instead, when a typeface is called &ldquo;Humanist&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s something like Gill Sans or Optima - a sans-serif typeface which, instead of being a classic Grotesque, a more attractive Gothic (a deprecated term as it&rsquo;s also applied to blackletters) like Franklin Gothic or News Gothic, or a Geometric like Futura or Kabel, borrows many of the proportions and characteristics of serif typefaces for more comfortable reading.</p>
<p>Note that I didn&rsquo;t mention Helvetica and Univers, which belong to yet another category of sans-serif faces the name of which I don&rsquo;t recall offhand at the moment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Pardon my French.</p>
<p>The way I understand VOX, Humanist is a subset of Old-Style – more specific, the first generation of antiqua types. We also use the term <em>Humanist</em> to describe similar skeletal structures, as well as traces of handwriting,  in sans serif designs.</p>
<p>A better term, perhaps, is <em>Dynamic</em> (as opposed to <em>Static</em> – Grotesques, Transitionals, Moderns – or <em>Geometric).</em> The reason is, these terms can be applied to sans serifs, serifs, slab serifs, blackletters, scripts &amp;c without historical conflict. This is especially relevant when a lot of contemporary type design combines elements from multiple – or even breaks out of – established genres.</p>
<p>PS: It has been pointed out previously that there are often skeletal similarities in geometric and humanist designs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh this is great. I&rsquo;ve since done a lot more reading and have put your answers in even more context. I was thinking that the term Humanist referred more to a specific era, or style of typeface design that wasn&rsquo;t actually describing a structural form of the characters.</p>
<p>By the way, I believe Helvitca under the Vox-ATypI system is a neo-grotesque? Here I am pretending to know what I&rsquo;m talking about haha&hellip;but I did discover that recently while perusing some typography blogs.</p>
