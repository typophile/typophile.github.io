  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In 1516, at the impressive age of 66, Griffo made his last type for his own press in Bologna. This tiny italic, in which four line increments vertically occupy almost exactly 1 cm, has an enormous x-height and fat counters, making these 32º books surprisingly readable. Is it the first such type made? Does anyone know about other early experiments with monster x-height?

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, that was my exactly my reaction! It looks like a Tony Stan take on the 1503 italic. I think only half a dozen or so copies of books printed by Griffo survive (he didn&rsquo;t get much done, what with being executed for murder a year after starting up), and it took months and an absurd amount of money for me to secure scans of two pages, so it was almost embarrassing to find such a homely thing. But nice work for someone probably with failing sight and no magnifying lens.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe that there is: it&rsquo;s much more harmonious with the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the Latin lowercase as a whole; the conventional (closed) form is really too complex; especially when it&rsquo;s doubled it can cause a distracting spike in the texture. The way I see it, the only really valid reason to use the conventional form is: if you want the font to be as conservative as possible; or if you believe Familiarity takes a very very long time to settle down, and readers are almost inherently used to the closed form even if it has a &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; problem.</p>
<p>In any case, the open form couldn&rsquo;t be as bad as the narrowness of
that &ldquo;h&rdquo; that you favor. :-&gt;  (That there is a display font though.)</p>
<p>BTW, just to be clear: I&rsquo;m not talking about the monocameral open form,
but the bi. The mono form is way too homogenous (in terms of readability).</p>

<p>I think this depends on how the counters are shaped and strokes weighted. I think either way can work, or not work, depending on how it is drawn. That being said, I do tend to find most open binocular g&rsquo;s unpleasantly distracting. Baskerville&rsquo;s is just fine, but then it is not very open.</p>

The opposite seems true for me, at least in the pointed-pen Baskerville-style squiggle, which is a black form that&rsquo;s lost its purpose in defining a white one. But you&rsquo;re right, it is an odd place to put a counter, and g (thanks to Griffo&rsquo;s reduction of the top story&rsquo;s size) doesn&rsquo;t really need a second counter for differentiation&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>That h would be unforgivable in text, but it&rsquo;s very smart there. I hope the w is nice and wide to match, as in Deepdene.</p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t stir much interest here and now, with the
communicative power of the internet to boot, how can they
stir interest in the broader world, centuries or even just
decades down the line? If they don&rsquo;t stir interest, maybe
it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not interesting. And I posit that the
great bulk of typefaces are not interesting because they&rsquo;re
mostly expressions of the designer&rsquo;s personal preferences,
something nobody cares about, or really needs to. When a
typeface is interesting, I feel it&rsquo;s because it transcends
the designer and becomes evocative of something that&rsquo;s
actually important.</p>
<p>Think for example of all the times Legato comes up and
generates such great discourse. I think it&rsquo;s because it
tries to answer a question that has been consistently
posed but just as consistently given mere lip service:
the central role of notan in type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so much is being in the right place at the right time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very true. But so much more is what different
people believe, with the candid confrontation
between them being the fuel of cultural progress.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi David, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed gambolling around this pasture for several months, and have found that the effort to accept whatever Griffo made has consistently been rewarded by a new or strengthened perception of its excellence. And one&rsquo;s eventual feelings about what actually exists are always more reliable than those about what might exist - which is a reason for literal revivals.</p>
<p>The evidence that the 1516er was designed all of a piece is as good as you&rsquo;re going to find in this period. There was certainly a press, Griffo&rsquo;s first; and he would have had no opportunity to use type made beforehand, and so no motive to make it (rather than, say, imagine it in detail, or even draw it).</p>
<p>Chris, Reading&rsquo;s not a magic bullet, but criticism there should greatly accelerate the learning process. I&rsquo;d have made this revival privately had Reading not existed, but I expect I&rsquo;d have needed to take it through two or three generations and several years of trial and error before it became satisfactory.</p>

The beauty of going to a grad school situation, and a fine one like Reading, is the community interaction of your peers there as much as the faculty. You bring your passion and love for the craft and that value will be available to your colleagues there as much as any other. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to question everything you hear&ndash;not to be argumentative but to get the speaker to clarify and bring support to what they say. Dialogue is the most precious commodity in school. Drink it in and pour some of your own for others. You are not going to Reading to be fixed, you are not broken. You are going there to participate in everyone&rsquo;s growth including your own.</p>
<p>I am sorry to sound like a verbose old man. Go there as a partner in learning and be who you are.</p>

<p>Do we really think laymen (as opposed to type designers who mostly naturally enjoy getting used to explicit features) are so -consciously no less- familiar with and satisfied by the closed form that they can&rsquo;t start reaping the benefits of the open form within an hour or whatever of first encountering it in a given text? It seems implausible to me. For example, when I show Patria to non&ndash;type-designers, nobody ever says anything about the &ldquo;g&rdquo;. Most of them actually get embarassed because they have <cite>nothing</cite> to say about the face, good or bad - it&rsquo;s just another Times to them - but of course that &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; is the first hurdle for a text face.</p>

There are other things I&rsquo;d change too (especially if I were making

most Baskerville revivals (although I should note that revivals

<p>Well, first of all I&rsquo;m no fan of slavish adherence to ductus,

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hrant ranted:</p>
<p><cite>I’ve come to believe that there is: it’s much more harmonious with the “spirit” of the Latin lowercase as a whole; the conventional (closed) form is really too complex; especially when it’s doubled it can cause a distracting spike in the texture.</cite></p>
<p>This evaluation seems a bit subjective to me. I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s any good literature on measuring complexity (Peter Enneson&rsquo;s &ldquo;role architecture&rdquo; concepts are the only thing that come immediately to mind), but in my seat-of-the-pants count, a Baskerville style lachrymal  lower g bowl has one more thing to count than a traditional garalde: in the latter, you have the &lsquo;T&rsquo; join where the bowl closes, and in the former you have both the lachrymal terminal and the gap between that terminal and the main stroke.</p>
<p>An open &lsquo;g&rsquo; in a sharp lineale such as Meta is even worse (by my rough counting scheme), because now you&rsquo;ve got two sharp corners on the terminal, and they don&rsquo;t register as symmetrical because their role is so different.</p>
<p><cite>Do we really think laymen (as opposed to type designers who mostly naturally enjoy getting used to explicit features) are so -consciously no less- familiar with and satisfied by the closed form&hellip;</cite></p>
<p>I tested both the binocular and the sesquiocular (Meta-like) &lsquo;g&rsquo; forms in Inconsolata on a bunch of laypersons, and latter always stood out as one of the first things they&rsquo;d complain about. I was tempted by the sesquiocular form because I felt that the requirements of a monospace font exert a lot of pressure to take away black in the &lsquo;g&rsquo; to avoid unevenness of color, and that the join of the lower bowl was one such place. Ultimately, I decided that the binocular form worked better, and now it&rsquo;s one of my favorite glyphs from the whole font - and something of a signature character for the font because so many of the glyphs are pretty vanilla.</p>
<p>As for whether the Baskervillian sesquiocular form is superior in immersive reading, that sounds like an empirical claim, and I&rsquo;m going to want to see empirical evidence before I really believe it. I&rsquo;m not saying that tradition is always good, but you had a lot of really brilliant type designers (and type design engineers, I would say, who sought practical readability as the primary goal as opposed to a merely aesthetic impression) over the last few hundred years, and there&rsquo;s a pretty strong consensus. Of course, Mr. Eaves himself definitely qualifies as a brilliant type design engineer, but maybe he&rsquo;s the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p>Among the ATF designs from the Benton era, a very few used a sesquiocular g - Cheltenham, which was an adaptation of an earlier, somewhat bletcherous font; the ATF Baskerville of course; Souvenir (which isn&rsquo;t <em>exactly</em> sesquiocular, but isn&rsquo;t standardly monocular either), and some oddballs such as Hobo. (I don&rsquo;t have the catalogs in front of me to flip through, otherwise I&rsquo;d probably find one or two classic Art Nouveau faces with interesting &lsquo;g&rsquo; shapes).</p>

True, and more of your type scat info would be really helpful; but what survives contains information sufficient for us to determine the printed impresions Griffo could, with perfect knowledge of his craft, have expected his types to make, within a normally small but at any specific point unknowable range of error. 
There&rsquo;s an element of global warming in &ldquo;one’s eventual feelings about what actually exists are always more reliable than those about what might exist - which is a reason for literal revivals&rdquo; but, since I care about making a good photopolymer version rather more than making a good offset version, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any proven reason to get fundamentalist about this.

<p>Well, a bit (i.e. in part) sure - I&rsquo;m human too. But it&rsquo;s also based on reasoning. One way to measure complexity is good ol' topology: only the &ldquo;B&rdquo; is as complex as the traditional &ldquo;g&rdquo;, and at least it has its two counters abutting. Another way to evaluate -if not measure- complexity is to just look at the thing. It almost looks like a Chinese logograph.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I couldn&rsquo;t make a nice open &ldquo;g&rdquo; for
Coda [either]. Hmmm, something in the mono water?
Oh wait, I know what it is: the sceen&rsquo;s coarseness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the requirements of a monospace font exert a lot of pressure to take away black</p>

<p>On the other hand, especially in mono fonts the &ldquo;g&rdquo; tends to look smallish (because making it look nice gives is it a small head) and making it darkish can help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that sounds like an empirical claim</p>

It&rsquo;s a design judgement (but based on more than just my whims).</p>

I was born in a town close to Soncino the town where Soncino family lived and worked.
Soncino family printed the first bible in jewish.

If you go to Italy go and visit the museum and the press of Soncino&hellip; in Soncino close to Cremona (north of Italy)</p>
<p>My favorite typeface of the renaissance was the one designed by Luca Pacioli. He designed it using the golden section.
From that font Garamond designed the &ldquo;Garamond&rdquo; typeface and from that one Simoncini re-designed the &ldquo;Simoncini Garamond&rdquo; (which as a beautiful italic)</p>

Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen the website for this museum. Has it got any particular typographic goodies or information on Soncino as a typographer?
Your history of type is quite new-school: it&rsquo;s Jannon you want to look up if you like (very sensibly) Simoncini Garamond.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ciao Gio!
At the museum you can find all of sort of things&hellip; When my school took us there i remember my professor of typography explaining how much &ldquo;particular&rdquo; Soncino was in the details. He wanted everything perfect. He chose Griffo as the best punchcutter. He had to have the best inks and the best paper, etc. The research confirms that because of his high quality today we can still admire his work.
My father was a typographer handsetting for almost 40 years&hellip; so i have ink of my hands since i was 5&hellip; Thanks to that i had the opportunity to know many stories in the typography world in Italy, especially north of Italy. 
In 1989 i had the opportunity to design an antology exhibition about Giovanni Mardersteig  (1872-1977) and during that period i had the opportunity to view his archive&hellip; see how he designed fonts&hellip; sketches, notes, letters to other type-designers, etc. I also discovered that when he was designing the font Dante at some point he get sick and he could not go to Milano (from Verona) to view the progress of the work. The typography was the one where my father worked! and becuase my father was also a good designer, Mardersteig sent a letter asking to my father to design the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo; for him&hellip; to not stop the work in the foundary. 
At the archive of Mardersteig i also could see many protopyes (in pear wood) of letters designed by Bodoni.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion you gave me, i will go to look for Jannon.</p>

<p>Yes, a plain monocular one, which I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d all agree is simpler than both the binocular and sesquiocular forms.</p>

<p>Wow, that sounds like an incredible opportunity. I&rsquo;m very interested in Mardersteig&rsquo;s Zeno font, for which there is currently no digitization. Could you possible be able to help me out with my queries from <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/12226">this thread on Zeno</a>?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had to gallop through this thread, so may have missed some things (I&rsquo;ll return to it), but the operative question about the binocular &lsquo;g&rsquo; has to be&ndash;to my mind at least&ndash;what has criterial cue-value toward visual wordform resolution here: closure, or the presence of a counter.

<p>The problem with the binocular &lsquo;g&rsquo; is managing the saliencies around the closure point of the lower bowl so the right things (the counters) have a proper and properly coordinated cue or pop-out value / aren&rsquo;t compromised by the density of black action between the monocles.

<p>BTW, yesterday I realized another way the open-bottom &ldquo;g&rdquo; can get better integrated into the whole of a face is that it has a terminal, whose shape can be like other terminal shapes (like in the &ldquo;s&rdquo;). I think this is significant.</p>

<p>Some people prefer the conventional binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re conservative. But other people who don&rsquo;t have that problem who nonetheles prefer it I think are discouraged by all the cruddy open-bottom binocular &ldquo;g&quot;s out there; type design is in large part about imitation, and there are simply far fewer good examples to emulate. It&rsquo;s easier to make a good closed-bottom &ldquo;g&rdquo; because there are already good ones out there. But its birth defect will not allow it to run the marathon.

<p>You really think that designers have been minding subtle readability advantages? I think they&rsquo;ve mostly just been following fashion - which I do agree is the motivation for the open &ldquo;g&rdquo; for most people - just not all of us.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it was fashionable. Everytime I post a face with an open bowl g, I get comments from folks who want it closed.  It must be a very secret fashion that nobody has heard about :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A tangential note to George&rsquo;s comment earlier in the thread about Griffo&rsquo;s 1516 italic beating Pierre Haultin for the &ldquo;niche-interest record&rdquo; of making nonpareil-size type: Although Fred Smeijers writes in <em>Counterpunch</em> that Haultin was the first to make such small type, H.D.L. Vervliet in his 2000 paper &ldquo;Printing Types of Pierre Haultin (ca. 1510-87). Part I: Roman Types&rdquo; (<em>Quaerendo</em> 30/2) and in the revised version in <em>The Paleotypography of the French Renaissance</em> seems to indicate that his was not the first (unless by a hair) but was, more importantly, the first to be widely used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Haultin Nonpareil roman and italic found their way into the main stock of the major European typefoundries. They were available until the end of the eighteenth century and, in that type size, for most printers the only choice on the market.&rdquo; (From the 2000 paper, page 90)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Nonpareil type size was a rarity in early sixteenth-century typography and only owned by the better equiped printers. In France, I noted early uses by Estienne (1534) and Colines (1538). Haultin’s type is a bit smaller (though its capitals are bigger) than the second 42 mm Nonpareil which Robert I Estienne used from about 1543 on in his octavo bibles.&rdquo; (page 97)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have just read this fascinating discussion. IMVHO, the only good g which opens on the right is in Jean-François Porchez&rsquo;s Ambroise.</p>
<p><a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/ambroise/fonts/">http://new.myfonts.com/search/ambroise/fonts/</a>
<a href="http://typofonderie.com">http://typofonderie.com</a></p>
<p>His Retiro&rsquo;s g is great too but more difficult to see on the samples etc.</p>
<p>Also, the best revival of Francesco&rsquo;s types may well be Frank Jalleau&rsquo;s Francesco</p>
<p><a href="http://beta.batfoundry.com/catalogue_4_francesco_.html">http://beta.batfoundry.com/catalogue_4_francesco_.html</a></p>
<p>As for the g, my preference would go to a monocameral g or a sesquiocular g, provided there is a reduction of the top storey size. This is, imvho, the only thing that makes the g stand out from other letters, especially if one considers that the eye will be looking at the top third of each character for identification. Once the top storey is reduced, the shape of the tail is partly irrelevant (cf Minuscule) &amp; I would favour the simplest design; the one that matches the way people currently write their g; more often than not, they do a monocameral g, with a closed loop so a monocameral g with an open loop should be easy to read.</p>
