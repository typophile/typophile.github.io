  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">It is events such as this that cause one to pause and ponder the fact that as designers, especially those whom are involved in product design, we do have the responsibility to be involved and to educate. Perhaps I am blowing things out of proportion, but in this instance I doubt it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quoted from an e-mail sent by Francois-Xavier Nsenga <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-quote-!&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->quote:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dear Colleagues, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Several hundreds of ex-patients in hip surgical wards in Quebec <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hospitals are soon being recalled for investigation of an eventual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contamination by HIV and other infectious diseases, due to a badly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sterilized surgical instrument. The whistle was recently blown by an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->employee in one hospital sterilization department, signaling that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->particular instrument is currently not being properly sterilized, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->simply because it is not, as it should normally be, completely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disassembled after use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the interviewed PR medical doctors showed us last evening in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->public media the incriminated instrument, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->declared: &quot;&hellip;obviously,  there is no way one could know that this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->head - of the instrument - is detachable &hellip;&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The employee in the sterilization department found out, by chance,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->probably through routine manipulation, that the head of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->instrument could be removed, and all components thoroughly sterilized <!-- raw HTML omitted -->separately. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One is thenn tempted to conclude that no competent design work was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->done at the successive life phases of the instrument use, &quot;from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cradle to the &hellip;&quot;. Quite obviously there has been incomplete design <!-- raw HTML omitted -->input in the early briefing phase and at the drawing board or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software designing phases. One could add also that no full design <!-- raw HTML omitted -->supervision has been ensured during the manufacturing process of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->instrument, and definitely no design intervention at the time of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multiple government inspections and approval procedures. Had research <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and practice designers been adequately trained to &quot;sell&quot; their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expertise to medical equipment vendors and government approval <!-- raw HTML omitted -->officials, to hospital purchasing agents and medical personnel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->training teams, most probably the whole present mess would have been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->avoided, or at least the damage greatly limited. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are told the surgical instrument has been in use for a couple of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->years without proper sterilization, and it is believed it has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sold and used not only here in Quebec but surely elsewhere in Canada <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and in other countries. One of the expected outcomes is the financial <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disbursement that will be estimated in millions of dollars after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legal responsibilities and indemnification will be ascribed. But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there also are inestimable social effects (increasingly diminished <!-- raw HTML omitted -->confidence of citizens in public institutions) and emotional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->catastrophes resulting from the agonizing anguish of all those <!-- raw HTML omitted -->individuals who might have been (or not!) infected and having (or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fear of!) spread the deadly diseases to loved ones. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another case for reflection by all of us, each from our respective <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sub-fields of design involvement. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
