body: "Hi there\r\nI was stopped in my track when I tried to use Ben Kiel's 'Accent
  Tools' script to build my diacritics characters in a Multiple Master font. I guess
  his script uses RoboFab to do the copying of the base glyphs and diacritics, and
  thus only does it for one weight (Wt0) \u2013 confusing the heck out of Fontlab.
  At least that is how it looked to me. So is there another method (script?) that
  will honour my anchors AND both weights (Wt0 and Wt1)?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nClaus"

  body: I have a list of accented glyphs in a text file and I use Generate Glyphs
    in FontLab. Glyphs>Generate Glyphs. Works like a charm.

  body: Thanks James. Worked just fine. Though it took quite some time to create the
    list, a script would have been more flexible in regards to component placement,
    but hey it was only dozen or so places I had to correct, and I have the list now.
