  has only just now discovered that <i>&#34;keywording fonts for sale online seems
  to have become a necessity now-a-days</i>? <BR> <BR>I mean, good on &#39;em for
  starting this project - it will do wonders for customer interaction and convenience.
  But it really is quite hilarious that it has only started being a priority at this
  point. <BR> <BR>How do the rest of you approach keywording your typefaces? Do you
  supply appropriate metadata like keywords, categories, descriptive text, etc. when
  you send typefaces off to distributors?'

    from massive internet &#34;user&#34; activity, rather than foundry whim. <BR>

  body: You&#39;re right, Grant. They are a pretty slow in the game. But <BR>they
    do have one of the four largest libraries to catalog. <BR> <BR>I think the idea
    is sound. Why not ask a zealous public to  <BR>fill in the blanks? Is it cheap?
    Naw. MyFonts already solicits  <BR>keywords from users and they don&#39;t give
    you a dime. <BR> <BR>Until someone hires me for this wacky skill, I&#39;ll be
    over at <BR>FontShop, plugging in keywords, hoping for a trip to Typo-Berlin.

  body: At least the mechanism they are using to add keywords to the various faces
    is following some sort of limited, controlled vocabulary. Allowing volunteers
    to simply make up words that seem to fit is a bit too whimsical a method to describe
    typefaces. I been through several iterations of brute-force metadata creation
    where two dozen people involved at an after work &#39;keywording-party&#39; certainly
    filled in all of the blanks - but most of the keywords were either too esoteric
    or convoluted to be useful.

  body: 'Keywording is all about power. Who controls the marketing process and gets
    to decide what the product should be like. <BR> <BR>Getty uses keyword demand
    to develop product; the process is professionized in the hands of marketers, not
    the content creator or the end user. &#40;And there is no independent &#34;keywords
    standards&#34; body representing all stakeholders.&#41; I don&#39;t see type design
    getting that corrupted by keywording, but the writing is on the wall. <BR> <BR>The
    question is -- whose language, whose keywords are you gonna trust, whose are you
    gonna use? Whose decision on what is &#34;esoteric and convoluted&#34;? <BR> <BR>I
    provided a list of keywords for a font recently: Awesome, Badass, Ballin&#39;,
    Chill, Chronic, Dope, etc... which one of my distributors replaced, in my better
    interests of course. Without a &#34;no f&#34;&#34;k with the keywords&#34; clause
    in my contract, they can do that. Pity, I&#39;m not sure the typeface in question
    was the right one to define the new niche, but still...'

  body: Nick, sounds like the book market. I remember a book &#40;by Sean Cavannaugh&#41;
    called &#34;Digital Type Design&#34; which had nothing to do with digital type
    design. It was a play with buzz-words &#40;by the [public] admission of Sean himself&#41;.

    wondering if some lucky folks who applied had already been chosen. Perhaps Stephen,
    with his legendary type ID skills, didn&#39;t have to go through the regular process.

  body: '&#62; i&#123;What ARE today&#39;s hot font keywords?} <BR> <BR>Nick, I don&#39;t
    believe it has to do with keywords being &#39;hot&#39; or &#39;dope&#39; or &#39;what&#39;s
    happening now&#39;. What&#39;s missing from much of the keyword data supplied
    to us by designers is sometimes even the most basic typographic classifications
    and historical terms &#40;eg: transitional, calligraphic, incised, condensed,
    etc.&#41; If we could consistently receive these terms in conjunction with a few
    mood or aesthetic-based terms &#40;eg: roughened, western, distressed, lively,
    casual, smooth, rounded, harsh, etc.&#41; - it would make our job much easier.
    I certainly appreciate appropriately whimsical keywords, but not at the expense
    of more common descriptive terms.'

  body: You&#39;re absolutely right, Grant. However, I&#39;m still interested to know
    what keywords, among the basic typographic classifications, are most used by your
    customers &#40;but I realize this is probably proprietary information&#41;. <BR>
