  service as well as business solutions: T1s, networks and so on. We considering re-branding
  but coming up with a logo for a company in this industry has become the biggest
  challenge I think I've faced. I've come up with plenty of logos look appealing but
  if you've never heard of the company you'd have no idea what we do just by looking
  at any of these logos. They want something that conveys the services in the logo,
  obviously without mucking it up with illustrations of a phone, computer, and tv.
  \r\n\r\nThat said, it is the same case looking at the major communications players,
  Comcast, Verizon, Sprint, at&t. Their logos have little to do with what they do.
  A couple of them reference previous logos or campaign trademarks. One thing we definitely
  don't have is millions of dollars to spend on creating brand awareness like these
  companies did. Basically I just wanted to throw this out there to see what other
  people have to say. Thanks!"

  body: "IMHO, logos are not obliged to tell what the company does. Where is the computer
    in Apple, or the tv in Sony, or the shoe in Nike? It is more important to tell
    the public the values you have (quality, service, status, etc.) or, just if necessary,
    a non-direct reference to the sector you work on (communications).\r\n\r\nHaving
    a logo with the image of the product or service you are providing may be a problem:
    if someday the company grows up and begins to sell something else, you\u2018ll
    have a logo outdated \u2014 and logos are supposed to live as long as the company
    does (in an ideal world, I mean)."

  body: "I understand what you're saying and I agree to a certain extent. There are,
    however, some logos that successfully show their product or service and I'm wondering
    if it can be done with a telecom company. Take zappos for example. Certainly not
    my favorite logo, but you look at it and instantly you know what they sell. Another
    example would be the Bahamas logo, its a beautiful interpretation of the islands.
    Airline logos usually do this too with the inclusion of a plane or wings or a
    bird. Thanks for any additional input!\r\n\r\nwww.zappos.com\r\nwww.bahamas.com"

    end up with orbiting balls or swooshes and some stupid brand guide that pretends
    they mean something. Instead come up with a really solid wordmark, or maybe a
    simple icon that portrays communication. Then, to bring the rest back in, come
    up with a tagline and guidelines for using it in relation to the logo as necessary.
    This way you have a great logo that can stand on its own or you can crank up the
    volume on the tagline to emphasize the details."
