Not that I know of. The best I could find for you is the binaries above (you don't need to compile from the sources!). It seems no one cared to build a package that makes the intallation for you, else that would be on Peter Selinger's page, I guess. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Once you expand the archive, all you have to do is copy/move the programs `potrace' and `mkbitmap' to a directory on your path. (I've added so much stuff to my path, I don't recall what is there by default.) Most likely /usr/local/bin will be on your path, so I suggest moving there. (First, open Terminal and type 

echo $PATH

to see what's on your path, and if /usr/local/bin is there, cd to the expanded folder (potrace-1.8.mac-[ppc/intel]) and type

sudo mv potrace /usr/local/bin

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, I downloaded the PowerPC version, 1.7--1.8 is for the Intel chips. /usr/local/bin is on the path, along with a bunch of other stuff, when I type echo $PATH.

What is "cd to the expanded folder"? Obviously I know where the expanded folder is, in a folder where all my downloads go (like when I have to download something from a publisher's FTP site for a book I'm working on)> So I looked and, yes, the expanded file, named "potrace-1.7.darwin6.0-powerpc" is there. Both "potrace" and "mkbitmap" [my quote marks, of course] are in the file named "potrace-1.7.darwin6.0-powerpc".

I gather that "cd" is somehow the command that locates "potrace-1.7.darwin6.0-powerpc". So what do I type after cd to get me to the next step, :sudo mv potrace /usr/local/bin"?

Thanks. Maybe I can through this tonight.</div>

I took a shot and opened Terminal. I got the Welcome and then the name of my computer, followed by the $ prompt. There's what transpired next:

[my_computer's_name]:~ [name]$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
my-Computer:~ [name]$ cd [folder all my stuff is in]/[folder my downloads go to]
my-Computer:~[folder all my stuff is in]/[folder my downloads go to] stephentiano$ sudo mv potrace /usr/local/bin
Password:
mv: rename potrace to /usr/local/bin/potrace: No such file or directory
my-Computer:~[folder all my stuff is in]/[folder my downloads go to] [name]$

So do I need to create /usr/local/bin?

		<div class="commentbody">You could install into /usr/bin, which is already on your path.

To create /usr/local/bin

sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin

Then you will have to add /usr/local/bin to your path. How to do that depends on what shell you are using. For bash (now the default on OS X), edit or create .bash_profile and add the lines:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
export PATH</div>

If things are not working yet, can you do this:

Go in /Applications/Utilities and click the X11 icon. If a xterm window does not open, click "Terminal" in the X11 Applications menu. Then, in the xterm window you get, type

	echo $SHELL
	echo $PATH

and tell me what you get. I'll come back two hours from now.

When you are done, you stard again X11 and type in your window

which fontforge
which potrace

If you get /usr/local/bin/fontforge and /usr/local/bin/potrace your problems shoud be over. You should then be able to forget about terminal windows and use Autotrace directly in FontForge.  If not, you tell me again what the path is.

I double-clicked and, therefore, installed potrace-1.7.darwin6.0-powerpc.1.pkg. Seemed to go off without a hitch.

I again opened the Terminal in X11, typed "which fontforge", hit <RETURN> and got:

/usr/local/bin/fontforge

Then I typed "which potrace", hit <RETURN> and got:

/usr/local/bin/potrace

Michel

[edit] Not true because though PATH is fixed, MANPATH is not fixed by the package. You need to do it by hand or type something weird like

nroff -man /usr/local/man/man1/potrace.1 to get it (which proves there was life before tex and latex, namely nroff and troff).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way Steve, the formats that you were trying to save to in Illustrator, SVG and EPS are vector outline formats. Saving a bitmap to either of those formats doesn't change the nature of the file, and when FF tries to open an EPS or an SVG it is looking for a vector document.

Saving to either a .tiff or .jpeg should work because their nature is that of a bitmap image. 

But why Potrace/FF wouldn't accept a .PNG is beyond me since that is the better and more open format, and is widely used by the FOSS/UNIX/LINUX community...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Potrace not accepting PNG format surprised me, too, Dan. But it just wasn’t available in the format menu. Nevertheless, good old Graphic Converter—hadn’t had a need for it in ages—came through. So I’ve gotten as far as opening FontForge, importing letterforms, and getting them into Potrace. Now I just need to get a better handle on what I want to draw in letterforms, actually draw them, import them, and begin the work. Geez, I just made that sound so simple.

I know it doesn’t seem like much to you folks who draw and have a bunch of typefaces under your belt already, but it’s actually taken me a bit to get to this point. Funny thing is,  now that I have gotten this far—part of why I got started on exploring type design is that I was idle—my work is starting to pick up. Two books poised to start: the first a straight layout job on a WWII history, and the second a design and layout on a handbook of sorts.

You never know what the charm is going to be.</div>

On my machine, I can open PNGs in FontForge... but I'm using Ubuntu, which sets all that stuff up for me. And they say Macs make life easier :) I just opened Add/Remove Software, selected potrace and fontforge, and BAM! everything works (except, of course, that I like to have my fontforge fresh every week, so I have to download anyway).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is <a href="http://cetus.sakura.ne.jp/softlab/b2p-home/"><strong>png2bmp</strong></a> that converts <code>.png</code> files to <code>.bmp</code> format. If you have lots of <code>.png</code> files, and <code>png2bmp</code> is installed, then you only <code>cd</code> to the directory where the <code>.png</code> files are and type

&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> for i in *.png; do png2bmp $i; done</code>

and you get all the corresponding <code>.bmp</code> files. You can also pipe the output of <code>png2bmp</code> into <code>potrace</code> so as to get all the <code>.eps</code> or <code>.svg</code> files.

For me that's enough. In fact, if I can avoid opening fontforge, I like it better, and it is in fact easy to write a script that starts with <code>.png</code> files with properly chosen names and generates a <code>.sfd</code> file where all the <code>.bmp</code> bitmaps are in the background of their corresponding character; that's just the kind of facility I like with fontforge.

Michel

PS. If you don't know how to compile <code>png2bmp</code>, <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/png2bmp-1.6-powerpc.pkg.zip"><strong>here</strong></a> is a compiled version for a ppc with OS X 10.4 (I am not sure it requires 10.4) ready to be installed (in package form). Don't click twice on <strong>here</strong> else the package is loaded twice.

What I mean is that if I can avoid opening the graphics interface, I like it better (especially if I have hundreds of font files to process). Of course, if I write <code>#!/usr/local/bin/fontforge</code> as the first line of a script, I "open" fontforge.</div>

I never needed to read png files but, whilst looking at how FontForge integrates Spiro, I realized that all you need for FontForge to read png files is to install the libpng library. I compiled a version for ppc running 10.4 and added it to the resources I put <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/ff.html"><strong>here</strong></a> as an answer on how to get the current development version of FontForge with spiro.
