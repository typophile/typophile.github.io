  book titled Nature's Ancient Religion (Orisha worship & IFA) was I am finding the
  easy part. Next, came the editing phase and that was slow, painstaking, but fruitful.
  I chose a professional service and was pleased with the result. Therefore, it was
  time to weed through the maze of demand publishers some call self publishers. This
  was full of pitfalls and cons. I also talked with the University Press industry,
  private printers, and my pal Shepard Swift who owns Moonlight Press. I had almost
  decided on Lulu but hated the limited options of font and paper when I stumbled
  upon Create Space. Create Space is an Amazon company so at least Amazon was covered
  (in the US). The royalties were more generous than Lulu and the big news was I could
  use any font in my PDF file!\r\n\r\n     By this time I was onto the professional
  formatters and I choose Accenture in Bloomington, Indiana as I assumed there was
  some hook up with the University of Indiana that has a strong University Press.
  The problem was I had specified using the Lulu styles choosing Verdana for the body
  and Garamond for the quotes in a 12 point font size. I was not happy with the lack
  of choices and choose these because I wanted a larger easier to read type. Perhaps
  it is because I am 50 and fighting using reading glasses, but I really strain with
  say a small normal sized trade paperback. I love to read and so I choose the larger
  type not gigantic. About this time I added 25 chapter illustrations that take up
  about 1/3 of the top of my 6 X 9 book. (Illustration below) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  formatting had three rounds of edits and I kept packing things in and changing things.
  These expired and I had already added another payment when I stumbled on Create
  Space. Well you can imagine that now I was and am really stumped. Sure it will cost
  me again reformatting but now I have a lot of options open to me. One thing I noticed
  as I began to learn about type was that I should use a third and maybe fourth typestyle
  for Chapter titles and headers. I am using the written out Chapter on left pages
  and the name of the chapter on right pages.  Well where I am now is looking again
  at the fonts.  I do know that I want a larger one for the body of the book probably
  in 12 point and I like Lucinda Sans Unicode.  I know that this is larger than the
  Verdana and so of course that would change my page count and clearly I would have
  to re index my index. I have an eight page glossary, a six page index and a rather
  unique section called Building Your Library. I came up with this idea because my
  book is targeting those outside the religion or those new to it. I find little use
  with a standard bibliography and a recommended reading list is better, but still
  not enough. My Building Your Library section is 22 meaty pages critiquing my fellow
  authors and listing the offerings in both the African branch of the religious tree
  and the Latin branches. \r\n\r\nIf any of the resident aficionados are still with
  me I would greatly appreciate  your sage advice. I am looking for types for the
  body (as I mentioned I do like the Lucinda Sans Unicode, but am not married to it).
  I also need a type in contrast for quotes in the body (of course I could use italics),
  I need a size and font for the chapter titles and finally a choice for the chapter
  headers. Any suggestions or discussions will be most appreciated. Thank you all
  for your valuable time.\r\n\r\nCharles Spencer King (Awo Ogbe Sa)\r\nLink to images
