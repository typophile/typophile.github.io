  get some feedback on what I have so far.\r\n\r\nBackground: The logo is for a gay
  pride merchandise company that wanted to avoid the traditional gay themed symbols
  (triangle, lambda, etc.)because the products are not traditional. (i.e. rainbow-themed)Key
  words were; unique,fun, friendly, creative.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe
  attached image contains the (rough) original form, print version with colors, and
  the web version.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/potential-logo_3660.jpg]"

  body: "Is it supposed to read MW? If it is I found it a little hard to read, however
    that is not the prime purpose of a logo. Where the outside and inside curves meets
    the horizontal there is an abrupt change and the interior curves need work to
    appear equal, the tip of the left and right-most interior curves appear lower
    than the others, this is getting confusing to describe I hope I make some kind
    of sense. I prefer the solid version at the moment although I find it a bit heavy
    overall.\r\n\r\nTim"

    I read your blurb and the logo looks strikingly like a pair of buttocks."
