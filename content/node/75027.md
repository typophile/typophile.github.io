body: "I am using Fontlab to create a font family; there is a regular, bold, and expanded
  typeface. I have installed the font on a windows machine (not my choice ugh), and
  it does run properly in MS Word (surprise, note sarcasm). I am only given the Expanded
  version as an option in MS Word. It defaults to that when I select the font. If
  I try to manually change it, it gives me Time New Roman, but calls the other fonts
  Regular, and Bold. It does however run fine in the Adobe Suite, CS2 (what a shock,
  note sarcasm) \r\n\r\nI have examined several MS fonts and I am using the exact
  settings (with my font names of course) under basic font name panel. I am literally
  creating the same naming convention and settings for each of the three fonts. Any
  ideas? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Cristobal,\r\n\r\nThanks, your link was helpful. I was able to resolve my
    problem and I discovered the 99th reason why Microsoft sucks. Office applications
    aren't interested in anything except regular, bold, italic and bold italic variants.
    All others are useless to the those applications. Do not get me started on hinting
    for fonts just so Windoze can display them adequately (if they are going to rip
    off Mac OS, why not rip off the things that make life easier).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
