  body: 'Quite a few Pro serif designs add such swashed alternates to their fonts.
    Ex: Garamond Premier Pro and Adobe Caslon Pro. Those are similar, but not spot
    on. Haven''t seen a swashed lc "b" like that before, though. Quixote by Textaxis
    is another take on swashes, but unfortunately not available (yet).'
