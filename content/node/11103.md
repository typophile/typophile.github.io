  body: 'I think this is almost certainly a hand-lettered custom job rather than a
    font. <BR> <BR>There are a handful of script fonts that are reasonably close.
    Try going to: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?what=fonts&amp;searchtext=script"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/Search?what=fonts&amp;searchtext=script</A>
    <BR> <BR>and browse through the script options. You may find a suitable substitute.
    Good luck! <BR> <BR>David'
