  body: I'm not much help, but believe Greco-Adornado from Lazy Dog Foundry has many
    similarities, but there are differences in most of the serifs compared to your
    sample. For instance, the /A has a left "arm" on the serif and a flat apex, whereas
    your sample has no serif and is pointed.

  body: "It's definitely not Greco Adornado. More likely, it's derived from a typeface
    originally called Georgian Caps. A more detailed version of same can be found
    here...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kudos-kaps-nf/one/"
