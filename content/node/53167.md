  body: "This is pretty big news and it looks like the good folks at Linotype have
    done their homework. I'm excited to try out the new Pro application, which offers
    Growl support, a configurable toolbar and even backup functionality.\r\n\r\nI
    know that some people will not be too thrilled at the EUR 79 license fee but it's
    half off until Feb. 28. (My only personal concern is whether the new application
    will disturb my finely tuned installation of FontExplorer X if I decide not to
    upgrade.)"

    large font libraries that it will have resource to, is this right?\r\nhttp://www.fontexplorerx.com/server/\r\n\r\nalso
    'sorry' my bad. I did a search and looked for any posts on FontExplorer X pro
    before posting, sorry about the double post. Merge if you can?"
