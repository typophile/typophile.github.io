body: Im designing a logo for a night club for a very difficult client that doesnt
  like to give me any sort of info on the thing im designing. Anyway, he basically
  wants it to be completely simple and ultra chic. I did a mock up for him doing a
  very simple mark and logotype &#40;straight out of the can helvetica neue ultra
  light.. which he LOVES&#41;. I am wondering what other typefaces are out there that
  would give me that ultra modern look, with very very thin strokes. Thanks!

  body: 'But you&#39;d have to be drunk to <i>start</i> with Helvetica!  :-&#41; <BR>Unless
    this club happens to have a Barbarella theme. <BR> <BR>Jason, before you choose
    a font, think of what it should look like. There are so many choices &#40;many
    of them nominally good&#41; that you can easily get distracted from a choice that
    will <i>really</i> click - so narrowing things down helps. <BR> <BR>I would say
    you need something narrow, thin, but also somewhat rigid. And if it&#39;s lc,
    maybe something with a small x-height &#40;unless visibility is a serious issue&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>And the most important thing: <BR>What&#39;s the <i>name</i>? Different
    glyphs sing in different ways, especially in chorus. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'I think element is a great name. And thinking about how the letters might
    fit into a whole, I had an idea: make it unicase, with cap-form &#34;L&#34; and
    the second &#34;e&#34; nestled into its hole - that would amplify the &#34;element&#34;
    idea too. I guess it might go against the client&#39;s stated wish for &#34;simplicity&#34;,
    but clients don&#39;t always really know what they want as much as they sound
    they do. <BR> <BR>hhp'
