  are used extensively in the book.\r\nIn my contract it says \"Designer will receive
  a credit line in the publication\" and there isn't one.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do and
  what should I do about it?"

    of free time on your hands, then you can pursue some course of action like demanding
    extra money, hire a lawyer, etc. Of course I think this would be a huge waste
    of time in most instances, and you should just show it in your portfolio if you're
    really proud of your work and be done with it. \r\n\r\nI would say a good 50%
    of the time, the credit info has been wrong when I get work in a publication.
    This is not always to my detriment, but they get at least some detail incorrect."

    by a fee for not giving credit? If not you aren\u2019t likely to get enough money
    out of it to be worth the hassle. Try just sending a nice letter politely requesting
    that this oversight be fixed in future editions of the book."
