  lot of organic and natural ingredients.  She was using clip art before this.  I'm
  doing this freelance and I've really only had a couple design jobs before, so feel
  free to tear it apart.  Just looking for a general critique.

  body: "I like the layout of the small text and the images of the herbs and flowers.
    That part looks simple and clear, but I don't think the gothic-revival \"herbal
    soaps\" and the sort-of Art Nouveau frame work with it. The \"flavours\" (if that
    is the right term) are too small, and in a fairly illegible face. If you want
    to keep that frame you're not really using the space in it properly. For example,
    the third one down. It's orange & what?\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of taking away
    everything that I think gives it too much of a homemade, slighty botched-together
    look. Find something equally clean and clear to say \"Rosemary\". Perhaps put
    \"Rosemary (etc.) Soap\" so you don't need to have the \"herbal soaps\" line.\r\n\r\n

  body: The vignette/frame really doesn't work and the text describing the scents
    is completely illegible. I agree with the previous poster that the "herbal soaps"
    line doesn't work, it's one ornate font too many, plus it's slightly superfluous
    information, as the previous line already says "herbal" I'd go for a single descriptive
    text for each scent saying "Mint and Comfrey Soap" or "Mint and Comfrey Herbal
    Soap" in one clear and easy to read font, maybe a different colour for each scent.

  body: "There are many issues with the labels but here is a simple way to improve
    your labels\r\n\r\nPurchase some handmade looking soaps that have relatively the
    same bar size as your clients soap. Choose examples with labels that look professionally
    designed. Purchase some regular soaps as well...now, measure the size of the type
    for the brand, fragrance, weight, description, ingredients, make a comparative
    list side by side to see what size your type should be for each application. \r\n\r\nYou
    should also be looking at soap in stores and recording what you like about the
    various labels and choose ways in which your soap will stand out from the rest
    in a positive way.\r\n\r\nMake sure that your label is readable from a shop-able
    distance from the shelf.\r\n"
