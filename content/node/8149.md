body: I&#39;m doing a form with a few columns.. an invoice. The columns include things
  like Date, a Services description, and Time spent. These look nice left-aligned,
  but then I get to the Amount column. If I left align everything, the decimals won&#39;t
  align. Some figures are just 20.00, others are 200.00, so if I align the decimals,
  I can&#39;t left-align it. Anyone have suggestions? Right now I&#39;m just left
  aligning &#34;Amount&#34; on the longest figure, with the decimals aligning. But
  this makes Amount look centered, so I&#39;m wondering what my alternatives are.

  body: Personally I&#39;d darken the column for the amount and drop the title all
    together. Without seeing it it&#39;s difficult to say, but given the subject of
    the table &#40;an invoice&#41; provided the emphasis is placed on the column it&#39;s
    unlikely the reader would misunderstand the figures were the cost. <BR> <BR>If
    you are worried about that then I&#39;d suggest you seperate the cost into two
    columns &#40;second one for the decimals&#41; then right align the cost column,
    left align the decimals next to it, and right align the title against the right
    edge of the cost column.
