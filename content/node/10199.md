  site</a> and turning on the satellite imagery funtion, people are starting to do
  &#39;Google Sightseeing&#39;. Pretty cool. <BR> <BR>Why&#39;s it relevant to Typophile?

  body: Cool stuff. <BR> <BR>The Hollywood sign is vertical so it&#39;s probably hard
    to see. But I did find the Hollywood Bowl... No letters though, sorry. Hey, what

    you go to look something up and then realize you&#39;ve just spend an hour randomly
    looking at things. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a great blog, Chris!
