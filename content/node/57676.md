  being the upper-case \"I\"]. The \"C\" has very nice anlg eo the lower serif [terminal?].\r\n\r\nThanks
  all,\r\n\r\ns\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/think_talk_act_4390.png]"

  body: "I'd call this a sans serif with a serifed \"I\" (it's not that unusual, look
    at Verdana \r\nfor example). \r\nActually, I think it looks a lot like Tahoma
    with an outline added. \r\nBut maybe someone else has a better match?"

  body: "I don't think Tahoma looks right, because of the K and the weight, although
    if stroke was added it might look this heavy and make it look like the K arms
    meet at the same point. The other question I have is whether this C is symmetrical.
    I don't have a better suggestion yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    are pretty dam similar indeed. :)\r\n\r\nMike, \r\n<cite>\"although if stroke
    was added it might look this heavy and make it look like the K arms meet at the

    right now to try and recreate this to see if it works. Can do tonight though (OK
    afternoon your time)."

    looks close enough to convince me. I don't think the difference is obvious.\r\n\r\n-

    to see this in action. I think it works &ndash; BTW, I think if you blur it a
    little (because the original sample is kind of blurry too), that angle on the
    top terminal on the \"C\" will stop looking decidedly wrong. Maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)"

    Now I can have a happy client who knows what typeface their own logo was designed
    in. \r\n\r\nDo design firms not bother doing style guides these days or is it
    just me? \r\n\r\nDiscuss. :)"
