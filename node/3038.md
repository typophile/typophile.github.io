  body: Nice. <BR>I really like how all of it is always wiped away in the end. I wish
    people hadn&#39;t been taking photos. And in a way I wish it hadn&#39;t been recorded
    either. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'The technique is wonderful, but I was struck by how incredibly banal almost
    all the images were: the sort of thing one would ignore completely in another
    medium. Often, in the early stages of each, there would be a moment when the abstract
    arrangement was quite powerful and interesting, but then he would turn it into
    a rather sickly figurative image. Pity.'
