body: "I would like to make any text of 16 mm in height using Adobe InDesign CS2.\r\n\r\nHere
  are the method I\u2019m using:\r\n\r\nFirst I make a boundary Grid with 16 mm offset.\r\n\r\nNext
  I create Text Frame between the boundary Grid to insert any text, say, it\u2019s
  a HELLO text.\r\n\r\nI create text \u201CHELLO\u201D in the Text Frame with Times-Roman
  font and the initial size of the font is 10 pt.\r\n\r\nI block all of the HELLO
  text and click the up-arrow of the Font Size tool in order to increase the size
  of the text until I can see the HELLO text in 4000% zoom is exactly fit to the boundary
  Grid.\r\n\r\nAnd final size of the text is 66.4 pt.\r\n\r\nHowever, there still
  left a Gap between the Font and the upper boundary Grid and make the text not exactly
  in 16 mm height.\r\n\r\nPlease see image about the Gap.\r\n\r\nAnd if I move the
  Text Frame manually until the upper portion of the HELLO text reach the upper boundary
  Grid, then the gap will be in the bottom of the boundary Grid vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo
  can anyone help me to find the method for this text treatment?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gap_5343.jpg]"

    you have to convert the text to outlines, then you can re-size it to any size
    you need. \r\n\r\ncheers"
