  though seems to think it is something extremely special.  I am interested in hearing
  why.

  body: "Hrant tends to be enthusiastic about any type design that seems to break
    with convention, especially if it does so in some systematic way that suggests
    innovative thinking. In fact, I sometimes wonder if he has ever met an innovation
    he didn't like. The idea that instead of slanting letters one could rotate them
    is something about which he has expressed excitement on a few occasions.\r\n\r\nNow,
    leaving aside the fact that I am simply not a very enthusiastic person, the problem
    I often have with Hrant's excitability is that it tends to be rather indiscriminate
    as to the actual results, i.e. he seems more interested in ideas than the things
    produced from them (this is roughly the opposite of my own inclinations, so this
    at least may be dismissed as a difference of personality). More seriously, it
    is difficult to judge the actual level of innovation in the objects of his enthusiasm.
    Once one starts digging, one finds the history of lettering is full of idiosyncratic
    invention and one starts to notice patterns and even the possibility of categorisation,
    at which point one begins to wonder if this innovation consists of people repeatedly
    inventing wheels that are not quite round and that, hence, no one who wants to
    get anywhere smoothly and efficiently wants to use. And then one begins to wonder
    if there has not also been a Hrant in every age, an enthusiast for those eccentric
    reinventions."

    people get together to talk shit about reading science, piracy and Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nTypefaces
    exist in many constituencies, and the cultural object (as opposed to the useful
    tool) is one of them\u2014just consider that several of the faces \u201Cacquired\u201D
    by MoMA haven\u2019t seen much practical use.\r\n\r\nInnovations are to be praised
    and cherished, given the sheer amount of conventional workhorses that are published.\r\n\r\nWho
    can know whether a break with convention will become the new convention? It\u2019s
    for users (typographers, not readers) to determine what will work. Change has
    to come from somewhere!\r\n\r\nAnd there are commendable niches for fonts which
    aren\u2019t smooth and efficient\u2014the fast-reading book face for mass usage
    is not the only criterion of excellence in type design, thank goodness.\r\n\r\n<em>More
    seriously, it is difficult to judge the actual level of innovation in the objects
    of his enthusiasm.</em>\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any problem. Legato, not a fan\u2014but

    disdain 'warbly' lines, and Legato's aren't exactly straight.  I do like Swagg
    however.

    have been said regarding how this font is rotalic instead of italic. However this
    font is not italic or rotalic at all. I would regard it as -- \"2012 Headline

  body: ">  inventing wheels that are not quite round\r\n\r\nLast year the show Mythbusters
    (a show that applies scientific testing to urban myths) tested square wheels.
    As expected the ride was extremely rough, although it smoothed out a bit as speed
    increased, and their testing showed that offsetting 2 wheels by 45% (as show in
    this photo so that 2 wheels had their corners touching when the other 2 had their
    flat sides down) helped further.\r\n\r\nVideo: http://tinyurl.com/c4dsgvy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/square-wheels_6612.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Okay,

  body: "To me it really doesn't feel like it's leaning, the way an italic does.  There's
    something about it that feels cantilevered, balanced.  It feels like its standing
    perfectly upright to me.  But I'm probably just crazy.\r\n\r\nI think it has something
    to do with the lowest \"horizontal\" strokes of the letters\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Slants_3449.png]\r\n\r\nYou
    can see the rotalic bottom stroke angles down from left to right, while my hastily
    prepared italic keeps a perfectly level line.  2012Headline looks much like the
    rotalic from above the bottom stroke and up, but the bottom stroke itself is angled
    contradictorily.  This is what I mean by \"cantilevered.\"  I think this might
    be what makes me view the design as somehow sitting upright, not leaning.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    idea pairing up Keks and 2012Headline also."

  body: 'I see the Olympic font as mostly italic in structure, especially the lowercase,
    but as a result of interpreting normally curved strokes as straight diagonals
    it introduces a topography of unconventional angles. The really novel aspect of
    the design is the application of these angles across letters that do not share
    conventional structural similarities with those in which they originate, which
    at once makes the design distinctive while giving it strong internal consistency.
    So, for example, the structure of the uppercase C works as a construction of an
    open-sided counter shape expressed as a minimal number of straight strokes: you
    can imagine a conventional italic C superimposed on it and the forms reflecting
    each other. But then Hague has taken this form and applied it also to the uppercase
    E, and has echo''d the same diagonals in a different way in the uppercase Z. The
    modular repetition of the angles gives consistency to the design. I think only
    a very few of the letters could be described as ''rotalic'', e.g. the lowecase
    s, and in my analysis they''re that way because of an approach to representing
    curves as minimal numbers of straight lines and angles, not due to rotation per
    se.'

  body: "<em>\"the more ways we can look at something, and look through something,
    the better off we are.\"</em>\r\n\r\nFor me the angle isn't discordant and isn't
    the problem, it's the primitive nature of the design. I've been looking at it
    more than I care to, but perhaps I'm not able to look through it the way you have.
    I see it as many others do. I cannot move past the fact that it is identical to
    the lettering Jerry the electrician uses to leave notes on walls with his electrical
    tape. It is for that reason that I see this as a step backward more than a step
    forward. If the 2012 Olympics type and logo become icons, it will be more due
    to scale of use rather than innovation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFrank U."

  body: "It's certainly primitive in some ways (in fact I think the font isn't really
    finished, which is why I shied away from [also] doing a typeface critique) but
    it's the novelty of its structure as a potential Italic that makes it significant
    for me. As a type designer all I really want is for 2012Headline to influence
    positive change.\r\n\r\nAlso though, it nicely illustrates Erik Spiekermann's
    comment (on Typographica*) that a typeface tends to brand an entity more than
    a logo. I guess except if it's Helvetica, Frutiger or something megabland like
    that.  :-/\r\n\r\n* BTW, it would be great if  you could replicate your comments
