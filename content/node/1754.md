  body: Nice one William. That&#39;s definitely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/minion/regular/testdrive.html?s=symantec&amp;p=48">Minion</a>,
    but I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;s the Regular weight. Just smeared a bit due
    to the anti-aliasing and compression in the image. Here&#39;s a slightly larger
    version of the logo to compare it to. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19028.jpg"
