    designed in 1999. Here is the sample from Part 14 &#40;Strange, Distressed Scripts&#41;

    link</a> &#40;beware if you follow the link past Identifont, because the iGraphics
    site is pop-up loaded&#41;, but Giovedi is a free font.

  body: Thanks Yves, I feel the same about you &#40;blush&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is the
    sort of font the Script Font ID Guide is for, I just picked the section that I
    thought it should be in &#40;Distressed Scripts&#41; and kept looking until I
    saw it. It was on page 20 of 21, so it was a fairly recent addition. I was getting
    all ready to give my speech about hand-drawn fonts being so cheap and easy to
    make, when I saw it.
