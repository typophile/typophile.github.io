body: "Something like:\r\n<em>\"Why did the chicken cross the road? [...]\r\nTo get
  to the other side.\"</em>\r\n\r\nA normal ellipsis doesn't seem to convey enough
  and emphasizing it (using brackets here) looks a bit much. And it's confusing, like
  the intent is to remove text.\r\nIs there a more eloquent way to represent this?"

  body: "An ellipsis can be used to signify several things and a pause is one of them.
    A long pause could be indicated by your choice of words. \r\n\r\nDon't think most
    fiction has lots of pauses in it, but if you're writing instructions (like how
    to tell a joke) you could just say \"pause here\"."

  body: "Perhaps an example can be found in plays by Harold Pinter ... the \"Pinter
    pause\"... he often provided stage direction in two different formats: 1. directing
    \"silence\" rather than pause ... 2. text [space] ... [space] text\r\n\r\nSouthpark
    scripts use the direction of \"silence\""

  body: I would say that you might string out your dots to indicate an especially
    long pause, and damn the style sheets, but your typesetter's going to ignore your
    STETs. Probably only a Dr. Seuss could get away with punctuational frolics.

  body: I believe an ellipsis is the correct character to use, but as PJay said, you
    may want to use a variant that is set slightly wider to indicate a more dramatic
    pause, if you can.
