  body: I'd love to know this as well. It seems a bit tactile, but its a digital font,
    seeing there are the same letters used all over.

  body: "I looked at the first poster, and that looks like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013|H&FJ
    Knockout]] (No. 70 , I think). There are 32 weights/widths, so picking the right
    one may involve using their test drive, but I think No. 70 looks pretty close
    to my eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I tried the Test Drive thing myself, and I can see that Knockout is only
    similar. The K, W and R are not right (among others), although they may be close
    enough, depending on your purposes. I am still trying to see if I can find a better
    match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "So far I have not found anything closer than Knockout. Another similar font
    is [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Rhode&x=22&y=9&sample_text=WALKING%20FOSTER|Rhode
    Medium Condensed]], and it does have the right K, but the uneven arms of the E
    & F are more like Knockout.\r\n\r\nIt may be a customized mix of the two fonts,
    but more likely it is a customized version of Knockout, if I had to guess.\r\n\r\n-
