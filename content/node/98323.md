body: "I'm working with an author who is self-publishing a book, approx. 120 pages,
  8.5 x 11 inches, with color illustrations throughout. He wants around 200 paperback
  copies, which is fine - any number of good digital printing outfits can do these.
  However, he also wants to produce about a dozen deluxe copies with sewn bindings
  in hard covers.\r\n\r\nAs I see it the most plausible option for digital printing
  is to produce a second layout with the pages in an imposition order, then output
  the spreads on 11 x 17 sheets that can be folded. Getting them bound separately
  is no problem if we could get signatures as F&Gs. However, the digital book printers
  I've checked so far will only output pages, not larger sheets that can be folded
  for a sewn binding, whereas copy shops that do 11 x 17 sheets won't do a well-produced
  bound paperback book.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to do the two runs at separate shops?
  Or does anyone know a good digital book printer that will also do the larger sheets?
  Or would it make sense, given the requirements, to print the whole thing offset,
  despite the short run?"

  body: Tricky situation! Yeah I don't have an answer but I'd be interested in what
    others have to say. I think your idea of doing the two different "editions" at
    two different shops may be the easiest way to handle it, assuming the difference
    between the deluxe and standard editions is great enough. Otherwise I'd suggest
    your last option of getting it all done offset if the budget allows. But I don't
    really know... :-/

  body: Thanks, all. I'll check with IBT. The author says he has a binder in mind
    for the deluxe copies, but I'll see how realistic this is. I agree it's preferable
    to have the printing and binding done by the same company if possible.
