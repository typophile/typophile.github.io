  body: "Good eye! Some flattening/widening and letter styling and you are quite close.
    \ \r\n\r\nI'm a bit surprised that the Kellogg folks wouldn't be designing their
    brands with more original lettering than this, but maybe that's the form 'original
    lettering' takes these days -- take an exisiting design and play with it.  \r\n\r\n-
