  recently purchased an HP Laserjet 1320 to spec type with since it is a 1200 dpi
  printer. Everything seemed to be going fine and dandy until once day, I noticed
  on any type smaller than about 12 point, there were some weird inconsistencies in
  the kerning of the font I am developing. The only reason I noticed is because the
  spacing problem was between /d/o/l/.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, the spacing of /d/o/l/
  should leave the o directly in the middle of the stem of the /d/ and /l/ because
  I have the same right side bearing on the /d/ as the left sidebearing of the /l/,
  and the /o/ has even metrics left and right. So why the heck would this be happening?
  \r\n\r\nI drive up to my old school where they have a HP Laserjet 5200, and print
  out my file, and voila, no spacing errors. So i'm thinking \"well, I guess the postscript
  driver on this older HP 1320 must not be as precise as the newer 5200\". So, after
  a bit of reluctance, I went ahead and found a decent deal on an HP 5200.\r\n\r\nFastforward
  a week... the 5200 arrives, and guess what.... SAME DARN PROBLEM!!!! Now I am just
  getting really bummed out...\r\n\r\nSo I decided to just expand the type on the
  page, and it printed with the correct spacing... but, am I compromising my fonts
  glyph contours by doing that?\r\n\r\nMy next idea was that maybe since I've updated
  to Mountain Lion, and I'm pretty sure my school has not, maybe Mountain Lion has
  some sort of different thing going on to make this happen. Which brings me to ask,
  has anyone with Mountain Lion noticed any problem like this?\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated! I'm getting really annoyed with the idea that I might be
  making metrics and kerning changes based on incorrect printouts....\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJosh"

    To this day, I never rely on a laser printout to judge kerning. In a way, laser

  body: "Not that this addresses your problem, but:\r\n<blockquote>the spacing of
    /d/o/l/ should leave the o directly in the middle</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are
    at least three reasons that's not necessarily true:\r\n- The left and right sidebearings
    of the \"o\" can be different, because: in a design with steep stroke stress the
    vertical positions of the extrema could be different enough to warrant it; the
    frequency of shapes to the left versus right of an \"o\" are different.\r\n- Ideally
    spacing should be propagated: the <em>left</em> side of the \"d\" isn't the same
    as the <em>right</em> side of the \"el\", and that affects the other sides.\r\n-
    To me the \"el\" should be looser (because it needs help standing out).\r\n\r\nBTW,
    there <em>is</em> one good reason to rely on a laser printout to judge kerning:
    if that laser print is your final output! :-)  Not exactly a rare thing either...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>If you don't mind me asking, if you don't trust a laser printer
    for kerning, what do you use?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, for initial work, I trust
    my experience a fair bit. I use the FontLab Glyph pallet at 128 points, with several
    words in the window, and at least one wordspace .\r\n\r\nBut I make final decisions
    from a printed book. If it is a new-to-us font, I make sure to get a copy when
    printed. Sometimes I have to pay for it. Use to be the typesetter was always given
    a complimentary copy, but that's rare these days. However, most often the publisher
    has no use for the F&Gs after the book is bound, and will send us those for free.\r\n\r\nYou
    need to check the kerning based on the media you're aiming the font at -- as I
    said in that long post. If you've got a friend at a publishing house, sometimes
    you can get a page or two printed offset when they're doing a test on something
    else. Offer the publisher a free license (or reduced price for a license for three,
    four, five machines ... whatever). They're saving you about $300, after all...\r\n\r\nAs
    Hrant says, if laser is to be your final output, you have to trust it. Find a
    machine where the kerning is the same between the same letter pairs no matter
    where they occur. Rarer than you might think, that. If John Hudson had good luck
    with the Brother, I'd trust that. We use HP 5550s in the office to make proof
    sets, and I don't trust them. Good enough for proof sets, not to judge kerning
    with 10-point type. "

    software, you might want to run a test to be sure. Print a test sheet on your
    printer using a different computer (one that isn't using Mountain Lion).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    go to the web site of the printer's manufacturer and see if there are any newer
    printer drivers available, in case there was a bug that's been fixed."

  body: "<blockquote>I recently purchased an HP Laserjet 1320 to spec type with since
    it is a 1200 dpi printer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest you to create
    a test document with sizes such as 12 pt and smaller. Print this document at 600
    dpi and at 1200 dpi. When the 1200 dpi output is darker in all sizes than the
    600 dpi output, it is probably the rasterizer which renders the characters in
    a \u2018different\u2019 way at 1200 dpi. I have a Brother printer with a PostScript
    clone rasterizer. At 1200 dpi it rasterizes type in a way that is similar to graphics.
    All pixels that are touched by the outline are rendered black. At 600 dpi, only
    the pixels of which the center lies within the outline are rendered black. Someone
    from Adobe confirmed me this story, so the Brother PS clone seems to be perfectly
    mimicking the PostScript specs when it comes to rasterizing type. I have seen
    image setter output showing exactly the same effect. Back in the days when true
    1200 dpi printers were rare, dedicated rasterizing suffered from being time consuming
    and laser image setters had rather thin spot diameters anyway, the idea of skipping
    a step in the rasterizing process may have been advantageous. Nowadays, processors
    have become much faster, and I think therefore it is now wrong to not rasterize
    1200 dpi output exactly the same way as 600 dpi. I wonder that some of the engineers
    and programers do not seem to adjust their rasterizing algorithms accordingly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Back
    to kerning:</strong> When rasterizing is inaccurate (as might be the case at 1200
    dpi), spacing and kerning will become inaccurate too. But also rounding effects
    have to be handled some way or another. I do not know where the rounding effects
    are \u2018hidden\u2019. Between characters? In the combination of characters and
    word space? Is there a difference in handling rounding effects between justified
    and non-justified setting? I\u2019d test this as well. In oder to avoid as much
    trouble as possible, I set all my test documents ragged left, switch off all InDesigns
    H&J tricks and make sure that kerning is set to \u2018metric\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>Back
    to spacing lowercase l:</strong> Although Walter Tracy recommends this in Letters
    of Credit, I do not think that it makes sense to space the lowercase l wider than
    d at the right. Tracy\u2019s rule may have made sense in the days of unitizing
    at 18 units/em where a tight fitted lowercase l would stand out more than a loose
    fitted lowercase l, but today I think it doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. When
    spacing, I ignore everything that is above the x-height or below the baseline.
    Except for f. I checked many many typefaces against Tracy\u2019s rule and concluded
    that it is rather an exception than a rule. I recall a Swiss book propagating
    to space all ascenders (such as b, h, k at the left) and wider than the other
    letters in order to avoid words like \u2018illuminate\u2019 to become a dark spot
    at \u2018illu\u2019. It has to be noticed though, that the example was set in
    a tightly spaced Helvetica-like typeface at a small headline size. I think in
    that case, the observation was right, but the method chosen was wrong. When one
    uses tight headline spacing at relatively small headline sizes, as was advocated
    by Berthold and many typesetting houses that worked for the advertising agencies
    in those days, it is not just the l in \u2018illu\u2019 that messes up the balance
    between the intercharacter spaces and the counters. It is rather likely that all
    spacing is crappy.\r\nWe should rather try to look what happens in front of our
    eyes, than trying to condition our eyes through misunderstood legends from the
    past."

    are not actually the resolution they seem from the name or literature, or at least
    not in the same sense that type designers think of resolution, i.e. as an array
    of more or less fully addressable pixels at x number of them per inch. I think
    there's probably a lot of information on this from the past, but it's been forgotten.
    \r\n\r\nThe summary is pretty clear though \u2014 when quality assuring the details
    of text type, one is advised to either use typeset output, or double the proof
    size along with the viewing distance, or acquire a reducing lens to point at such
    an oversized proof.\r\n\r\n"
