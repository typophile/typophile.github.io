  I'm looking for a good display font for the title and chapter headings.\r\nSomething
  from the late 1800's, particularly type coming from the Industrial Revolution. I
  saw this picture and I have highlighted some type that I feel is close to what I'm
  looking for. What fonts are these and does anyone have suggestions for something
  that is similar?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/american-type-detail_2_4130.jpg]"
