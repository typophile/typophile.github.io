  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I've never created a typeface in my life but have modified vector letter to whatever suited my purpose. Apart from the obvious experience and expertise you would gain by being trained in this craft, when creating a typface is it a case of working on points / corner / edges of a character getting to a point where it feels right, then moving onto other characters?

Say when looking at certain free fonts you can immediately tell that a majority, there edges just do not feel correct and you run into all sorts of scalability and edge issues when you try to use them, as opposed to some versions of the same / similar typeface but done by a professional. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tim,

I think the right anwser is <cite>Practice, practice, practice.</cite>
I'm an amateur type designer myself, and although I started out with a design about two years ago, I still haven't come up with a quality font, I'm still working on it (not full time obviously). I guess it depends on what you call <cite>perfectly crafted</cite>. I know for a fact that it takes some type desingers six years to create one quality font. The final stage (digitizing) is I believe the shortest phase. Of course, there are other designers who'll do it a lot quicker, like Tomi from Suomi, who holds the world record (http://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/201002.html) at 3 hours and 4 minutes...

Kind regards,
Jean Paul</div>

No. A great typeface "is not a collection of beautiful letters, but a beautiful collection of letters." The key thing is designing each glyph in the context of other characters. Often designers do focus on getting a core of 'control characters' to work together. Your design idea might even start with a single character, but to realize it in a face, the development effort is design in context. And the 'craft' is a lot about design characters so they work together and look good together and are easily readable together.  

If you read Tracy's 'Letters of Credit', and look at [[http://briem.net/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm|Briem's web site]] you will get the idea. </div>

I don't think this works. What might look perfect in isolation usually needs tweaking recursively as the other glyphs take shape. It all has to sing in the same key.</div>

has anyone tried out the beta of <a href="http://schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html">Glyphs</a>? It's, for now, some rough going, but one of its most promising features is you can edit kerning, spacing, and -- indeed! -- glyph <em>shapes</em> right inside a sample string.

I believe you are wrong on many counts. Digitizing is not the final stage, nor is it the shortest stage.

Not everyone takes 6 years, and not everyone starts with drawings that need digitizing.

How many fonts have you completed?

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Fábio. It is a lot of work. When I started, I first just dabbled with type design. Then I got a bug for it. I spent months on a font that ended as utter crap.

But then I spent another monts on a font that ended up pretty good.

And I kept going. I got a job, then a career, but I kept doing types. And I think I was right to do so.

You're probably right in many cases, yet it depends on what your workflow is. I´ve been taught to always make the design on paper and when that´s (almost) complete, digitize it. In my opinion this goes for type design as well as design for anything else.

<cite>How many fonts have you completed?</cite>

Zero, and counting ;-) I´m probably speaking out of place here...

@Tomi:
Is there a sample of your 3h4m font somewhere?</div>

Perhaps we need to reconsider the initial question. What is a perfectly crafted font? Are you thinking of Gill Sans, Times Roman, Helvetica, Garamond, Bodoni, Frutiger, Trinité, Meta or other hunderds of great fonts?</div>

Given that perfection doesn't exist ;-) what about an answer like this:
"A perfectly crafted font is a work of craft which exploited in the best possible way the technical tools available at the time in order to reproduce a perfectly crafted typeface (notice the two distinct meanings of "crafted"). Whereas a perfectly crafted typeface is a work of design which serve in the best possible way a given function in a given period of time".</div>
