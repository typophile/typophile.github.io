    sure that is now available for license, but you  <BR>won&#39;t find it on the
    internet and you have to know to  <BR>ask about it. What I realized this morning
    is that this  <BR>version of the italic z must only be in the original design  <BR>as
    commissioned in 1998 by a well-known magazine.  <BR>This version is used in the
    magazine. But all the other  <BR>printed examples I can find &#40;like the one
    in <i>Indie Fonts,</i>  <BR>for instance&#41; show a more normal z. I took my
    sample  <BR>from a PDF I have of a specimen that was created for  <BR>the <i>Bukva:raz!</i>
    exhibition. But this typeface did not  <BR>receive any award in that show; it
    was in the exhibit,  <BR>but was not chosen -- how&#39;s that for a riddle? <BR>

    Type</i> I was using a OT font that I made based on the earlier version of Fenway
    that Sports Illustrated has, but then Matthew sent me an updated version with
    less extravagant italic <i>z.</i> <BR> <BR>BJ, Fenway is not based on Miller,
    which is a Scotch roman. Fenway is more of a Dutch oldstyle, with direct links
    to Fleischmann.

  body: '<i>&#62;Kent, thanks for the info.</i> <BR> <BR>? That was John with the
    info this time.  <BR> <BR>More Fenway info: Matthew&#39;s spiel about it is <BR>
    <BR><blockquote>&#34;Fenway was designed as a replacement for Times  <BR>Roman,
    use for many years in the magazine [<i>Sports  <BR>Illustrated</i>]. It has a
    stronger color than Times but an  <BR>equivalent character count, achieved in
    part by making  <BR>the capitals more compact. . . . Fenway is not a historical  <BR>revival,
    although the Roman probably owes something  <BR>to Joan Michael Fleischman &#40;1701-1768&#41;
    whose types  <BR>are among the most legible of those cut for the smallest  <BR>bodies.
    The Italic, on the other hand, displays the  <BR>influence more of Fleischman&#39;s
    contemporary and  <BR>competitor Jacques-Fran'
