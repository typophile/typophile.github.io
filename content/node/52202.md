  I find this site very useful.\r\n\r\nI don't generally make logos, I do one or two
  every year. This year a friend of mine asked for one and left me with a pretty open
  brief: the company's name is zoo station, they import hardware and sell it.\r\n\r\nI
  had a lot of ideas about, zoo, animals, africa, stations, technology, computers,
  etc.\r\n\r\nOf all my proposals they chosen this one:\r\n\r\n[[http://flash.quietroot.org/zs/ZooStation_3a.jpg]]\r\n\r\nI
  don't know if I made the right choice when it comes to chosing the right type face.\r\n\r\nI
  made this choice:\r\n\r\n[[http://flash.quietroot.org/zs/ZooStation_3_final.jpg]]\r\n\r\nI
  don't know wether it helps the logo graphic or not.\r\n\r\nAny tips will do."

  body: "You used a soft, humanistic typeface with a sharp, angled and blocky mark.
    The type contradicts or contrasts with the mark, which ever way you want to look
    at it. If you want to use Myriad try different layouts (bolder, lighter...) also
    tighten up the letter spacing a little. Conventional wisdom dictates that the
    two elements either contrasts or compliments each other.\r\n\r\nOf course their
    are many humanistic sans that could replace Myriad...Or you can try to match the
    style of the mark with a sharp, rugged and utilitarian typeface. Either way I
    like that you gave the mark and type the same importance.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: "Thanks for your feedback, much appreciated. I will try a few of the usual
    sans ( Gill Sans, Univers, that area ) and see what I can get out of it. Something
    was bugging me about the choice in font, but I couldn't point the finger.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."
