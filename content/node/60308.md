body: "hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI have a friend who is psychiatrist/pedo-psychiatrist
  and who ask me for a logo. He ask me two thing; he'd like to have the \"Psy\" \u0470
  greek letter inside the logo and/or to have a notion of evolution/getting better.
  Right now i didn't have found the solution - if any - with the two requirements.
  The initials of his familyname and forename are \"mm\"\r\nSo I have two projects,
  i tried to be very sober and minimalistic, the logo usage for his needs will be
  almost always in black:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psy1_5735.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psy2_5499.jpg]\r\nSo,
  any thoughs on this that might help?\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n"

    in which the two elements of the single letter are of different heights (like
    your second example), so to create a relationship with the \"branches\" of the
    \u03A8. It could be either mirrored (descending from the trunk) or parallel (ascending)
    or asymmetric.\r\nAlso, have you tried something with capitals?"

    if you try to invert the implied shape in order to make it resemble more a tree

    too much up and down, wich might be an good example of somes psychic illness,
    but for a psychiatrist i think it's too unstable, not comforting. Personally the
    project i like most is the second of 25th july post (because of the regularity
    and the simmetry and it's the most stable) and the 4th one of the last post (with
    the progressive mm). i am reworking the proportion of the 'mm' to make it smaller.\r\n\r\nI
    have a color version if needed (that's RGB for now but could be easily converted
    to a 2 colors for print)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/psy9_5981.jpg]"

    but the letter PSI stands more for parapsychology. Also see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi]].\r\n\r\nMaybe
    not the kind of thing your client actually wants...?\r\n"

    much lost on anyone outside of other professionals, especially if it's distorted.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    focus on the \"growth\" part for a bit, and not the psi or m per se?"

    he show me what was his first logo (just a psy symbol in a circle) the 'm' in
    it was the first thing i saw, and my first drafts.\r\nBut i was kinda, unsatisfied
    with inverting the symbol, maybe inverted it has another meaning (ie inverted
    christian cross mean ante-christ), so since he's in hollydays and i won't ask
    him until he comes back, i tried other ways.\r\n\r\n@marco: nope, i don't think
    he want that, i'll talk with him about that. I know - with the help of comptetent
    people - he use hypnosis  for heavy traumatised people case, i don't know if it's
    considered as parapsy ?\r\n\r\ni tried with a sort of flower/propeller thingy,
    does it insprire growth or hope (or at least a positive image????) to you ? (it's

  body: I think the flower, altho' pretty - is to generic, as Bolivar states. Experiment
    further with the M-s, psy-symbol and the tree metaphor. It has great potential.

  body: Since it's for a person and not a brand I think the name should be spelled
    out and capitalized just like you did in the last example. Even including "Psychiatrist.Pedosychiatrist"
    is a very good choice. As far as the symbol goes, the Psi glyph sounds like a
    great idea and the client wants it. Only problem with Psi is that in a Greek speaking
    community it will be looked at as a letter not as a symbol that might be confusing
    cause the guy's initials are Ms. So if you're not in Greece it shouldn't be a
    problem.

    focusing on the symbol.\r\non the previous version i've tried a dark grey for
    the sans symbol, i've tried a grey lighter here because it was not visible.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think i should make a sans lighter in weight (for thoses who like the sans
    better)? Personnaly i like the sans better because it looks the most stable, the
    most solid, and people who are in distress are in need for that, something that
    they can grab on.\r\nBut on the other side it's also a very subltle work so maybe
    a serif like - i serioulsy need to improve my technical english on design because

    i had it corrected to show my friend (or the client) but forget to update it here.\r\n\r\n@thepiaypus:
    one thing i can see in this logo is some sort of eagle, looking to the right.
    For the reference of Bank of America, i google it but can't find nothing that
    look like this logo :?  The more i look a the leaves logo thing, the more i find
    it too heavy and not subtle enough.\r\n\r\nThe client loved a lot the flower/propeller
    logo too and the double mm where he see an aqueduct. i tell him my point of vue
    (simplicity is best) and my preference (the top right logo), now he's looking
    with colleague of him to have opinions. but i had to calm him down because first
    he wanted the double m mixed with the flower/properler logo :D      \r\ni'have
    already worked on some typo, but since i don't know his choice, it may be too
    early to post them, i don't want to use your time for nothing."
