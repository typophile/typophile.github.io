  of old armenian typewriter character sets (or scans of documents and texts that
  were written with said machines) that would help me work on a corresponding design
  or serve as a head start. i have begun with olivetti 32 as the latin basis, and
  have completed cyrillic so far.\r\n\r\nif anybody could point me to such resources
  or links, i would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot."

    Olympia Armenian keyboard is pictured in the book \"Century of the Typewriter\".\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    On my web page at\r\n\r\n[[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kyb04.htm]]\r\n\r\nI
    have added a diagram showing the Royal, Olympia, and Underwood keyboard arrangements.\r\n\r\nThus,
    the Olympia arrangement is now visible on the web for those without access to
    the book \"Century of the Typewriter\", although only one of the two arrangements
    shown there is illustrated.\r\n\r\nAlso, in preparing the diagram, I discovered
    that the specimen of an Underwood Armenian typewriter illustrated in a photo on
    Wikipedia had <em>two</em> of the keys with upside-down legends.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    From this site:\r\n\r\n[[http://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/buttons,typewriter/Interesting]]\r\n\r\na

    the active portion of an Armenian typewriter turned out to be of an Underwood
    model. And from this I resolved one ambiguity; although two keys had upside-down
    legends, those legends were also swapped between the two keys they were on, and
    whose right-side-up forms they resembled. So I was mistaken to take the little
    hook as the decisive factor - I will be correcting the diagram on my web page
    this evening.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In a flash of insight, I thought that at least Microsoft
    would have been able to find out the keyboard layout used in Soviet Armenia. And,
    indeed, they have an Eastern Armenian layout that does not correspond to that
    used by Royal, Olympia, or Underwood. However, I also ran across this page:\r\n\r\n[[http://hy4linux.blogspot.ca/2006/09/new-armenian-keyboard-layouts-for.html]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    says that Microsoft managed to get two keys switched around!!\r\n\r\nI am not
    feeling so bad about my blunder now.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Wikipedia also has this image\r\n\r\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Armenian_Library_P1130664.JPG\r\n\r\nof
    a Royal typewriter with an Olympia-like layout; the other one from Century of
    the Typewriter that I didn't show on my site resembles it more closely, but I
    think two letters on the right are switched.\r\n\r\nAs I've also come across a
    news item saying that the government of Armenia was pondering whether to use a
    typewriter or a phonetic keyboard layout, I can only conclude that Armenian typewriters
    were not terribly common in Soviet Armenia; of course, typewriters were controlled
    in the Soviet Union due to the threat of <em>samizdat</em>, but one would have
    thought the bureaucracy would need them for its own use in quantity if nothing
    else."
