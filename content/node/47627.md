body: "Since early 2008 I've been working on a new font for an Extreme Sports and
  Adventure magazine edited in Argentina and several South American countries.\r\n\r\nThe
  main aim is to create a new serif family, highly readable, modern and printing friendly.\r\n\r\n[[http://marcelosoler.com/mcs/patagonia.php
  | Here]] you can find a [[http://marcelosoler.com/mcs/patagonia.php | a sample PDF]]
  for Patagonica text (the font is embedded in the file).\r\n\r\nHigh resolution printing
  is allowed for testage purposes.\r\n\r\nHope anybody can help with objections, corrections
  and suggestions.\r\n\r\nMarcelo Soler\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_6269.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ill01_6739.png]\r\n"
