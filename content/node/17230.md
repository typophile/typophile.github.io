  \"The Fl\xE4ming S\xE4ns\"\r\n\r\nAccented letters would be good, but not necessary.
  However, fake umlauts are a must! The logo will be set in blackletter, of course."

    think something simple is better. If youre doing something heavy, dark, or aggressive

    concept album could be called La Operina.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just to sound like a
    total nerd...\r\nThere was already a band named umlaut back in the 90's. They
    were part of that crust punk crimethinc crowd and, if I remember correctly, were
    a joke started to make fun of other crusty metal bands. I believe they only made
    a 7\" that was distributed with the old crimethinc magazine. I also think they
    parodied the motorhead logo a few times. \r\n\r\n"
