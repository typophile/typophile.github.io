		<div class="commentbody">Jacob, first off, I'd ditch 3a-4b. I've seen this design a million times and it doesn't say 'landscaping' to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now, I'd say 1a and 1b are stronger, as they are, than 2a and 2b. Only because the grass in the 2 versions looks more like hair to me. Otherwise, I prefer the visual concept in the 2s. Push the grass more towards blades, rather than spikes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think 1a and 1b are a bit generic, but workable. Try to make the type and leaf feel like more of a unit, rather than type and a leaf. Also, the central vein in a leaf is just an extension of the stem, so you should draw them as one central curve. It's the 'spine' of the leaf, so be conscious of that when you draw it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And finally, ask the client how they want to be perceived. Right now you've got a heavy bias towards modern, clean type, which makes me think that's what you're shooting for, but that will help the other decisions fall into place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and that secondary green/screen is too light. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Generally, the 1-2 ideas aren't bad, they're just not great.

		<div class="commentbody">Cris the reason you see the cliches in landscaping is that landscaping is more than plants its more about the whole environment including walking paths. I don't think they should be resorting to cliches, but I feel more research is needed. Questions like: Is it a family business with a good name? Is the business well known? What is the competition doing? I think less work more research is in order.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the input guys, this is great!  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have made some changes to the &quot;grass&quot; logo, made it look a little more like grass.

		<div class="commentbody">Jacob, I agree with you that the grass looks unkempt. Also, it still reads as hair to me in 1a, 1b, and 2. Check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this image<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see what I mean by a blade of grass. Grass is essentially just long, narrow leaves. Like leaves, they start thin, swell, and come to a point. Your grass starts thick and comes to a point, more like a hair. The curve in 4 looks more like grass to me than the grass does. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Daniel pointed out, landscaping is not just about plants, but about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shaping<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the land and the plant life on it. It's design as well, so more overt rhythm and pattern are probably ok as long as the forms feel natural. I'd pull away from your specific ideas and return to sketching and research for a bit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe it's just me (and it usually is) but I think that the original post's v 1a is awesome, just ditch the leaf. I see the two flourishes against &quot;landscaping co&quot; as a hill, on which that type sits. I don't think that you need such a literal leaf and grass approach. This is a perfect chance to experiment with type and it's ability to create illusions of depth and allusions to other imagery. Push it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aaron</div>
