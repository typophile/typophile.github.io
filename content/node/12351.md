  Film Fest #2 in NYC this summer. While we've already filled a few slots with some
  excellent typographic shorts, there's room for more. What films are out there that
  we should proactively invite for submission? If you know of a good site or motion
  graphics firm with work to consider, please post their link or contact information
  here.\r\n\r\nSome of you who've been in the business for a number of years, are
  there any type films that you're familiar with that deserve a good dusting-off for
  display to a new audience? Post any leads here, and we'll follow up.\r\n\r\nThanks--\r\nJb"
