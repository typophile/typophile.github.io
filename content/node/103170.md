body: "Hello, The organisation I work for is rebranding and considering choosing a
  font as our main font for use on letters, publications, signage, etc - that everyone
  in the place should have this font installed on their PC. What no one seems to have
  considered is the potential cost implications as we have about 400 people working
  here! \r\n\r\nI think our first-choice is Futura, which I know is not free. How
  would we go about getting a license to cover 400 people? (And is that ridiculous?)
  Are there site licenses for font? Alternatively, if we went with a font that seems
  to be installed on most of our standard-issue PCs (Gill Sans etc) would we need
  some kind of additional licensing or is that free to use? We are based in London
  if that makes any difference to the legalities.\r\n\r\nHelp greatly appreciated.
  I've Googled this but I still don't understand. Thank you!"

  body: Thanks very much for the info - very helpful. Hadn't considered a custom design
    because I assumed it would be too expensive but if it's comparatively cheaper...
    might look into that! Cheers

  body: "What Hrant said. Other considerations when using system and application fonts
    for any kind of commercial work include, whether the license covers you for everything
    you want to do, e.g., \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/RedistributionFAQ.mspx\r\n\r\n...and
    versioning. If you are running more than one operating system, more than one version
    of an operating system (Windows XP and Windows 8 for example) or have any other
    peculiarities in your computer set up then you may find that people have different
    versions of the same fonts installed which can cause problems when sharing documents,
    templates, etc...\r\n\r\n"

    find out how much a site licence would cost. For example, on MyFonts, add the
    fonts you want to your shopping cart, then change the number of users to the required
    number. You\u2019ll get a revised price that you can use to help you make your
    decision."

  body: Thanks for the additional information. I will check things out online and
    also with our IT dept to see about the potential OS issues. I certainly am learning
    a lot! (And Hrant, I may very well email you.) Thanks again!

  body: "A site license for hundreds of users is not ridiculous, but it can indeed
    get expensive; you have to contact the foundry and negotiate. However if you're
    picky about your visual identity you shouldn't go for a free solution (whether
    it's bundled in the OS or simply a font that's free to use*) mostly because everybody
    and their mother can do that too, but also because of quality issues (although
    OS fonts are rock solid).\r\n\r\n* Although some of those put limits in terms
    of commercial use.\r\n\r\nOne interesting solution that some companies go for
    is the commissioning of a custom design. One drawback to that is that you have
    to wait for it to be completed, but the advantages are: it can actually cost less
    than a large site license for an existing prestigious typeface; and you own the
    results, so it's 100% exclusive to you (and you can even <em>sell</em> the font
    yourself).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
