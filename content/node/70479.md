body: "I'm looking for a type that will match the atmosphere and feeling of Sniglet.
  Sniglet is available at the League of Movable Type, and is really quite pretty.
  I first saw it and said to myself that I would never use it, but I've found an excuse
  in the header of a website I am working on for a colleague, the only problem is
  now I can't for the life of me figure out a suitable type to pair with it for the
  subheads (navigation buttons and page titles)\r\n\r\nI've looked at a few handwritten
  fonts, but would like to stay away from that, but the more i think on it, that's
  really my best option. If anyone has a font that they think would work well with
  this, I would be indebted.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    for this.
