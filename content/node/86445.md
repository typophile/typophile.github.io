  my dissertation and I looking for people opinions to use in my third chapter of
  analysing what people think are good/bad typefaces and why. I will then use this
  information to investigate whether a \"perfect\" typeface could be designed.\r\n\r\nMy
  working title at the moment is \"can a perfect typeface be designed or does it already
  exist?\"\r\n\r\nMain questions I'd like answered are:\r\n\r\nWhat are your top five
  favourite typefaces and why?\r\nWhat are you top five \"perfect\" or near perfect
  typefaces in your opinion and why? (if they differ from the question above)\r\nWhat
  are your least favourite typefaces and why?\r\nWhat are in your opinion the worst
  five typefaces and why? (if they differ from above again)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough any
  other opinions/information/advice/pointers will be very appreciated and will really
  help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    are those, generally of scientific bent, who pursue the cult of readability.\r\n\r\nI
    hold that in typography the perfect typeface is the one that's right for the job
    at hand\u2014and the hand and eye of the typographer who's doing the job. So that
    suitability, aptitude and experience are aspects of the typographer's choice of
    type tools, as much as taste.\r\n\r\nBacon still worth pondering:\r\nhttp://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-43.html\r\n\r\nAnd
    you might ask whether perfection is at odds with postmodernism."

    cannot exist something such a perfect typeface.

    Take a look at all the newer typefaces that are meant to either improve helvetica,
    or to be somehow truer to the helvetica's roots. ie: Bruno Maag's \"Helvetica
    Killer,\" Christian Schwartz's Neue Haas Grotesk, Michael Hernan's Uniform.\r\n3.
    Read about Univers in Frutiger's big book.\r\n\r\nThen consider the claim to neutrality.
    And even if Schwartz isn't after perfection or neutrality in his design of Neue
    Haas Grotesk -- well, that doesn't really matter. Surely we can strip out our
    intentional fallacies when viewing and critiquing type design. Which is to say
    that the intent of the designer isn't as important as the design's reception and
    use. \r\n\r\nLast, and most important, read:\r\nDistinction: A Social Critique
    of Judgment and Taste, by Pierre Bourdieu\r\n\r\nYour thesis really is one part
    typography and at least one part sociology.\r\n\r\nGood luck! "

  body: "I am of the scientific bent, and I do pursue the cult of readability, but
    I do also think that beauty is functional. Neither from the point of view of readability
    nor of aesthetics there can be a single ideal face. Different designs are more
    and less readable at different sizes, and in different media, such as print and
    screen. And what aesthetics is desirable will depend on your audience, the content
    of the document, and on cultural factors, which change with the times.\r\n\r\nEven
    from the point of view of readability in terms of comfort and reading speed, aesthetics
    is also a major factor, because whether the reader is motivated to read is one
    of the biggest factors in readability. Both the content\u2014how well written
    the material is\u2014and the visual aesthetics of the experience are extremely
    important, as well as whatever burden typeface design puts on the decoding process.
    And that is assuming the content is of interest to the reader. \r\n\r\nI do think
    that as far as design that puts the least burden on the decoding process, there
    are some fairly narrow windows for what is ideal at a given size. But this allows
    for a great deal of flexibility on aesthetics. And furthermore, in display type
    aesthetic considerations are usually more important than ideal reading comfort
    or speed. \r\n\r\nDavid Berlow's [[http://www.aiga.org/cyrus-highsmith-on-david-berlow/|shepherd
    story, as related here by Cyrus Highsmith,]] is pretty much on target.   "

  body: "Jennifer ,\r\nI am trying to grasp where you are going with this?  There
    are numerous philosophy writings on perfection and the like which can take you
    around the mountain long enough to give up on the concept in general.\r\nAnything
    that pertains to \"like or admire\" doesn't mean much more than the Miss America
    Pageant or Queen of the Senior Prom.  If you are after a more functional way of
    looking at things then you really need to spell out your criteria much better.
    \ Even if you raise the banner of readability, you have quite a job to define
    the parameters well enough to allow comparison.  I am sure you don't just want
    a \"Top Ten List\" in the vein of late night TV shows."

    your head without seeing it. Although it will be around as far as I can see, sometime
    in the future there will be a new typeface that has replaced the universal use
    of Helvetica. The perfect typeface is situational and has historical context.

    you define \"perfect\". \r\n\r\nUnless you're just looking for subjective opinions,
    but what's the value of a research paper coming up with a list of favorite typefaces
    unless some criteria are stated? If you ask 500 people and the most frequent answer
    is Arial, does that mean that Arial is the \"perfect\" font? Of course not. "

    that believes that there is no single perfect typeface, but a substantial handful
    of expertly crafted typefaces that are each perfect in particular situations.
    I do believe there are good and bad typefaces. I also believe that even a mediocre
    typeface may occasionally be well-suited to a particular use.\r\n"

    inspires their next creation. I just read on a thread somewhere on here \"I want
    a font that bridges a grotesque and a more engineered font like DIN.\" So then
    they make it. And if they do it exactly like they wanted to, it is the perfect
    font.\r\nAnd then they think of the next font that would be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut
    why wouldn't perfection be fleeting just like everything else?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Perfection is very fleeting--even carrot-chaseingly out of reach.  There have
    been brief moments when I have deluded myself enough to think that a typeface
    I had been working on was "starting to look decent" but the next morning brings
    me back to the cold hard truth of the matter--it isn't there yet!  Sometimes,
    even a one hour dinner break gives enough distance to put the kibosh on any delusions
    of grandeur.  For me, it just ain't happening.  I have a couple dozen faces that
    I have never even released, let alone dared label "Perfect".  This is where a
    client can help you.  Clients bring deadlines, deadlines change the stakes to
    mean "as good as I can make it in the time available",  hardly perfect.
