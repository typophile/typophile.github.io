  designing a new font for my personal purpose. I've just finish basic latin characters
  and now moving to Vietnamese characters (or someting like: Western Europe, Central
  Europe...). How could I link to these all ones because the software just shows basic
  letters on keyboard. (I'm using Fontlab)\r\nI had an idea to search their unicode
  code (on Wikipedia)  for each but it took a lot of times to do so.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your answer.\r\n\r\nDuong."

    body: "Thank you for your great response, Michel. This is exactly what I'm finding.
      At first, I also chose MS Windows 1528 Vietnamese for those characters. But
      I was a little bit confused because there were some missing words that I couldn't
      see. (I'm Vietnamese :-)).\r\nBy the way, maybe I will expand my font list to
      characters in Western Europe (1252) or Central Europe (1250). So, could you
      also give me the way to access to these full character sets? Or just choose
      MS Windows 1250/1252 is enough because it contains full words. I thought it's
      not enough because in the link below it looks like more characters than words
      list in Fontlab.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Latin_character_sets_(computing)\r\n\r\n"

    You'll have to scale and redraw the different elements of say a circumflexacute
    that it will be easier to place and hint. I recommend building separate accent

    to look like. For the other information the charts contain, I find the file <a

    much more useful. For instance, to get the relevant characters for Vietnamese,

    all the glyphs you need in one shot (plus at least the variants you need for the
    composed diacritics). Just curious, I don't use Fontlab.\r\n\r\nIf I do that with
    FontForge for Source Sans Pro, here is a possible view of the capitals (the script
    generating the encoding grouped the \"base glyphs\" together, \"base glyph\" being
    here the first character of the canonical decomposition.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SSProWhite_5801.png]\r\n(I
    never had so much trouble inserting an image...)\r\n\r\nWhen I use the same encoding
    with FontLab (with the glyph names taken from Source Sans Pro), some characters
    look missing and are not placed where expected (Abreve is placed somewhere else
    and the corresponding uni character looks missing for instance)."
