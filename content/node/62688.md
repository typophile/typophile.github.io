  and the closest I got was \"Evolver\" from Canada Type, but it isn't the one. It's
  very close, but the characters f, & etc are a bit different.\r\n\r\nThank you in
  advance,\r\n\r\nJakob\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fishbeer_6566.jpg]"

    href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1ND\">Harrington</a>. There is also a rougher
    version called <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/rossetti/fonts/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D240%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DGalleria%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26seed%3D23\">Rossetti</a>
    from Scriptorium.\r\n\r\n@Dewey: In the future please use a new thread instead
    of piggy backing off a previous node."
