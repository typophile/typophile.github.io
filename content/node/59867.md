body: " First (on the left) is a serif, maybe art nouveau style? Distinctive three
  line etching on wavy crossbars for A and H. Mackintosh style dot ornament in the
  C counter and the D. It's close to a few fonts, but just not quite there. Seems
  close to Mackintosh and Mackintosh variants.  \r\n Second is clearly a decorative
  face, but I could not pin down the pattern of three diamond\u2013large diamond\u2013three
  diamond ornamentation.\r\n\r\n Both are metal type, obviously, owned by Peter Koch
  of Peter Koch Printers, my employer for the summer.\r\n\r\n History unknown.  "

  body: "Some additional information from the very well informed Mr. Gregory Walters
    of Ohio, (via the also excellent Georg Kraus). Thanks to Mike F for the concurrent
    assist as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"The face on the right is called Diamond Inlaid.
    I think this is a \"new\" name. It was originally Ornamented #1071 from the Bruce
    Foundry. Charles Broad (Typefounders of Phoenix) had new mats made and cast the
    24 and 36 point sizes with the Diamond Inlaid name. I think that was in the 1960's.
    Your type is from that reproduction casting. His mats were then acquired by LA
    Type Founders and that operation was bought by Barco in Illinois. LA Type has
    been shut down, and I've been told that the mats were scrapped, though I don't
    know for sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother Hubbard, (on the left), was originated by the
    Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston. I can't give you a date, but it has the look
    of the faces brought out in the 1880-1895 era. The earliest specimen I have showing
    the face is an 1894 ATF Collective specimen. It says the face originated with
    Dickinson, so it was likely designed before 1892 (when they joined ATF). The original
    fonts had line ending ornaments and also swashes. The swash was placed above the
    type. Applied to the Monopol specimen, it might be placed to start at the top
    right serif of the A and swirl up over the B. It could also start at the top left
    serif of the B and swirl back over the A. The swash would have been on a smaller
    body. If you have 24 pt. type, the swash might have been on a 6 or 8-point body.
    As for Monopol, it is clearly a derivative of Mother Hubbard if it was introduced
    in 1900. That's quite late for a face like Mother Hubbard, but what they used
    for Monopol looks a lot more like Art Nouveau than Mother Hubbard does. So it
    might in indeed have been reintroduced in 1900. Mother Hubbard was shown in an
    1896 ATF specimen, but is not present in the 1906 ATF specimen. ATF was quick
    to drop the old quirky faces of the artistic printing era.\" "
