body: "While researching the German calligrapher Conrad Scherzer, and a book which
  he illustrated in the late 1930s, I ran across a website selling Nazi era objects
  and ephemera. While scanning the listings looking for the item the search had flagged,
  I ran across what would probably prove to be a rare bit of printed ephemera. If
  it were genuine.\r\n\r\nThe item is purported to be Heinrich Himmler's calling card,
  and as the description describes, \r\n\r\n\"It was found in Himmler's apartment
  by a US Soldier, and brought back home. then he forgot about it. After he died,
  his widow found them, and the Hitler cards, and sold them to the guy I bought them
  from. These cards are larger than US business cards - approx. 6.3 cm x 10.5 cm.\"\r\n\r\nIntrigued
  by what typeface the card might be set in (some Antiqua by Koch, Tiemann, Renner,
  Erbar, et al.) I clicked the thumbnail to see an enlargement.\r\n\r\nAs you can
  see, it's MF Benton's \"Wedding Text\".\r\n \r\nSeriously. The amazing typographic
  (and historic) naivet\xE9. Not even using the alternate, less Anglicized H either.
  \r\nAnd then there's that SS. . .\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HH-card_4914.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  should note that I found nothing on-line on Scherzer in English. Gerry Cinamon's
  very comprehensive [[http://www.germandesigners.net | site]] makes no mention.\r\n\r\n"

    inventions. \r\n(I started to have my doubts when I read the part where the soldier
    only found one calling card in Himmler's apartment instead of a drawer full.)
