body: "The typography of Mardi Gras is always fun, playful, and bright.  This year's
  parades and floats showed no different.  It's funny, but I've noticed over the last
  few years that the writing or signage on each float (whether it is the label of
  the float or a sign that is actually part of the design of the float) has become
  increasingly elaborate.  Signs have gone from just plain paint, to glitter, to actual
  neon lights.  The fonts on Mardi Gras floats are always fancy, and are usually some
  type of italic, old style serif font.  It usually reminds me of the Victorian age
  because of its elaborate qualities.    This year though, the labeling of each float
  on the tractors pulling the floats was a thick, sans serif script type font.  Although
  elaborate, most fonts on the floats are easy to read so that viewers on the ground
  can understand what they say as the floats rush by.  I find it interesting that
  type used in Mardi Gras affairs just looks like Mardi Gras.  I think that the designers
  have developed a distinct identity and continuity among Mardi Gras signage and that
  this signage is extremely effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_8445_4176.jpg]\r\nFloat
