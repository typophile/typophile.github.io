  I'd appreciate your opinions.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick blurb about the concept:\r\nI
  started by playing around with the letters CCI (the system which is the core of
  the company) which came to visually depict a butterfly - CIC (imagine the C on the
  right as a mirror image). It made a lot of sense. For me a butterfly is a symbol
  of new and fresh beginnings. It's light weight and easy and something everybody
  wants around - just like the company's products. \r\nWhen I showed it to the guys
  they were even more excited because it reminded them of the butterfly effect which
  relates to the Chaos theory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). It
  can get complex, but in short it is the idea that even small things can have the
  greatest impacts. Simple and profound.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this butterfly went through
  several revisions until reaching this final one. To enhance the BF effect concept,
  as it flies over the word Nuveon, it effects the letters by changing their colors
  from blue to a complimentary yellow. The color of the E is a mix between the yellow
  and blue to indicate partial change that will be complete once the bf has passed
  the letter. Makes sense?\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nuv_0630_5255.gif]"

  body: "I understand constructing the letters make for these kind of forms, but optically
    the n/u looks a lot wider than the o (even though they might not be). I don\u2019t
    think the letterforms are especially interesting in themselves, but they also
    lack overshoots and appear to be heavier in the horizontals compared to the verticals
    (optically correct monoline is not actually monoline). \r\n\r\nYour butterfly
    is not such a bad idea, only it does not look very much like one now. The body
    is out of style with everything else in the logo, and the wings are maybe a little
    too rigdid? I\u2019d love to see a head or some antennas on there. Colourwise
    it\u2019s not very butterflyish.\r\n\r\nThe colour, as Riccarod mentions, are
    troublesome. A logo needs to work in b/w, and with the current concept you\u2019ll
    loose everything. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think this could evolve into a fairly decent
    logo with a little help."

  body: "Thanks for your honest feedback.\r\n\r\n@frode frank, I took your suggestion
    and modified the bf to look more like one. I really liked the simplicity of it's
    'body' so I left it as is. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the multiple colors at the font
    is to reinforce the concept by having the bf impact elements as it flies above
    them. I like the yellowish color juxtaposing the dark blue because it seems like
    the bf 'turns the letters on' as it flies above them. I've created 2 different
    color palettes and 2 ways of handling the font. One with 2 colors, the other with
    just 1 color at different opacity. \r\n\r\nI've changed the font: I think this
    one works better. Looks more unified. All letters are at the same hight. I've
    modified the N a bit to make it even more unified (removed a little line it had).
    Also it seemed to me more like a tech startup co. font than the previous.\r\n\r\n@Ratbaggy,
    it'll help if you're a bit more specific. What makes it feels like technology
    from 10 years ago (gosh, I think I still had a Windows computer back then. The
    horror!). Does it look more current now, after I've modified it? I'm actually
    facing a bit of a challenge as this company offers products some of which are
    geared for more traditional clients (i.e. car manufacturers factories here in
    Germany), that's why I initially kept dark blue as one of the colors as I see
    it as more of a traditional color.  \r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nuv_0701_5167.gif]"

    (the most on the font), so why do you write that I choose to ignore the advice?
    Yeah, I didn't take all of your advice simply because I don't agree with it all.
    For instance in regards to the bf head and color you've suggested. I've looked
    at many bf treatments in great logos and some are created using only a few simple
    lines and one color. I don't think it has to be so descriptive to be successful.
    \r\n\r\nThat said, hiring a professional designer is not an option at this point.
    That's why I'm here, asking for advice. \r\n\r\n"

    needs all the help Frank and Riccard0 offered. \r\n\r\nThe butterfly's morphing
    of color you describe in your top post isn't evident in the logo. If you have
    to explain it, it's not working. The colors you've chosen are lovely, but there
    are too many and they separate the letters into two words - nu veon, or nuve on.
    If that's not what you intend...it needs fixing. "

    blending of the two wing shapes), and we're seeing sort of an incorrect perspective
    here. To be honest, I'm not totally sure which one is the original intention....\r\n\r\nI
    know it's a very attractive idea, but I would strongly consider rethinking the
    \"butterfly changing the letters\" concept. The usage of color to set off two
    un-spaced words is so common, I can't imagine how you'll overcome the immediate
    reaction in peoples' minds to interpret it this way...but perhaps I'm just not
    imaginative enough. On a side note, if you ever found yourself in need of an an
    animated version, say, for a TV commercial (hey, anything's possible, right?),
    the element of motion would convey the idea unequivocally."

    many different interpretations of good design meaning there is good design and
    there is better design. I think the following discussion has been a effective
    design process - a well balanced discussion between laziness and overly imaginative
    art. By laziness I mean it's easy to just create something that communicates the
    idea of your company, this could of been done in a few minutes. However, you have
    invested time and energy in this project in an endeavor to produce a logo that
    is well thought and meaningful. On the other-hand, logo design is not creative
    art it is design (a concept poorly understood). \r\n\r\nMy opinion is keep going
    - produce as many logo's as possible, write a list of single word adjectives that
    describes your company and create a simple logo and then get feedback. Exactly,
    the process your undergoing. You obviously enjoy art and design. \r\n\r\nRest
    assured, you get to point realizing after all - we are polymorphic and need to
    draw the line eventually and this what will define your company. If you feel stuck
    employ a designer. Cheers."

    Not a perspective. We see only one side of the wings, the left side. I wanted
    it to be as simple as possible but still recognizable. I've made the wings with
    80% opacity as an interpretation of the light coming through in wings of a real
    bf.     \r\n\r\nNow I'm trying to find the right font for this little insect and
    figure out how to get it to effect the type somehow (the butterfly effect concept).
    \ @wongxiao, I agree about the splitting of words with colors. It's confusing,
    unless there's a clever way to do this while keeping it clear it's only one word.
    I'm trying other ways to impact the font. I'm sure it's there, I just need to
    find it :)\r\n\r\n@moggycat, I like your philosophical angle. I used to work in
    the architecture field and we've always wondered if there's really any 'new' design
    any more, as everything evolves out of inspiration of something else that has

    drawn and find good and weak points of your best designs. And the ideas/impressions
    they give. Ask a few people you know what they think these designs provoke in
    them.</li>\r\n<li>Put your design into a computer. <strong>Most important: forget
    about colour for now</strong>. Do it all in black and white. No greys allowed
    either.</li>\r\n<li>When you think you're done and others approve it, go and do
    the full colour version of your logo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMost professionals
    still work in this order. Amateurs tend to do the opposite. Start from the last
