body: I know that various type designers have now added the Euro sign to their typefaces
  that existed before the advent of said symbol &#40;Times New Roman, Courier and
  Arial, to name a few&#41;.  But--in your esteemed opinions--what is the legal/moral
  implication of designing a &#34;typeface&#34; that is a collection of various interpretations
  of the Euro symbol in 30 or so prominent existing typefaces?  The idea would be
  to design the symbol in keeping with the general aesthetic rules of each typeface
  &#40;regardless of whether the original designer has revamped the typeface to include
  the symbol or not--all&#39;s fair in love, war and new symbols, right?&#41;  Of
  course I&#39;d throw in a few unique designs &#40;that don&#39;t fit with any existing
  typefaces&#41;.  Just a little project I&#39;d like to start working on, and I thought
  I&#39;d turn to you all for some feedback.

  body: Oh, another thing... <BR>Does anyone know how serious the EU is when it comes
    to maintaining the general design?  If so, any ideas as to how I can obtain those
    standards?  &#40;Can&#39;t find it on the EU site.&#41;  Anyway, I want to stress
    that my idea is in no way meant to step on the feet or rights of other designers--its
    really just a collection of Euro variations, not necessarily belonging to any
    one typeface &#40;just compatible with some others&#41;.  Thanks everyone.

  body: Given that the overwhelming majority of fonts have already been retrofitted
    with the euro symbol, what&#39;s the point of the project? Just trying to understand.
    It&#39;s kind of like deciding to do your own letter &#34;a&#34; for a bunch of
    different fonts. <BR> <BR>Legally, if you did it from scratch and didn&#39;t use
    outlines from the original font, there presumably would only be issues for fonts
    whose abstract design is protected, and maybe not even then. But it&#39;s something
    that I&#39;d consult a lawyer about, or not do at all. <BR> <BR>Ethically, since
    the symbols aren&#39;t much use without the original font, I don&#39;t see a major
    problem. Though there is also the issue of respect for the original work, kind
    of like when modifying a font for a client&#39;s internal use. <BR> <BR>As for
    the EU and the design, they have no interest in maintaining the &#34;general design,&#34;
    but rather maintain the EXACT design. But they treat it like a logo, in that it
    can only look exactly one way. The people who specified it clearly had no concept
    of how a currency symbol is used, so type designers just ignore them. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

  body: Well, you&#39;re right, it is very similar to choosing a character and nursing
    an obsession with it.  It might be crazy, and the more I think about it, the more
    I realize that I might like it better if I make several variations on the character
    completely unrelated to any existing typeface.  Perhaps a simple statement to
    the EU. <BR>Thanks for your input, I&#39;m fond of your work.

    agree. It&#39;s a monster. A logo sometimes maltreated by designers. There is
    only one solution. Make a matching euro sign in the proper typeface and match
    the figure width. <BR>As far as this &#34;Brussel-euro&#34; design I know that
    Jean Francois Porchez has both versions in the Sabon Next. One matches the &#34;Brussels-width,
    the other one the figure. <BR>henk <BR>'

  body: Dear A.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m with Tom, I don&#39;t think making a symbol font
    would be a very good idea, getting permission from the various designers and vendors
    would be time-consuming and some would probably not give you the okay.  <BR> <BR>Making
    a coffee-table book, or a Web site that uses images or a Flash movie might be
    more interesting.  <BR> <BR>As for the EU we occasionally get communication from
    EU workers &#40;I wouldn&#39;t classify them as EU officials necessarily&#41;
    asking why we don&#39;t include the official euro in our fonts - I usually respond
    with more questions - are you willing to have your documents reflow if we match
    the official width, or should we shrink the symbol down and center it? What do
    we do about bold or italic? What do we do with decorative fonts? etc., So far
    I&#39;ve not received a reply to any of these questions. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR>Microsoft
