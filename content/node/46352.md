  body: Thanx, looks similar but its lacking some botanic elements. Would be nice
    to find one with more plants and flowers.

  body: A decent version of this has not been digitized. If you really want the letters
    to be pristine the best you could do is stop by the St Bride Library in London
    and ask to see the original prints.
