  award at ED2009, the European Design Awards 2009 competition. Malabar grew out of
  Martel, a multi-script design that I initially created in 2008 on the MA Typeface
  Design course at the University of Reading. The Latin component of the family is
  distributed by Linotype, and you can buy it here.\r\n\r\nThe design\u2019s success
  was announced on Sunday, 17 May 2009, at the ED-Festival in Z\xFCrich. Malabar received
  the silver award in the original typeface category. This isn\u2019t Malabar\u2019s
  first distinction; its six Latin fonts received a Certificate of Typographic Excellence
  in Type Design at the Type Directors Club of New York TDC\xB2 competition in January
  2009. \"\r\n\r\n<<<\r\n\r\nIt is available for sale through Linotype at:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html\r\n\r\nGreat
  Stuff, Dan! We are all proud!!!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Typeface Category. But I guess it's best if Satya reveals the details. Congratulations
    to both of them.

  body: "The \"original typeface\" category page over at the <a href=\"http://www.ed-awards.com/index.php?option=com_easygallery&Itemid=634\">ED-Awards</a>
    website only lists the Gold and Silver winners. But the winners of Bronze prizes
    are as follows:\r\n\r\nBree, from TypeTogether\r\nFC Autobahn, from Autobahn\r\nPlaneta,
    from Dani Klauser Graphic Design\r\nNabil, from Emanuela Conidi\r\nKina, from
    Francesca Bolognini\r\nTexteron, from Cape Arcona Type Foundry\r\nFedra Hindi,
    from Typotheque*\r\n\r\nThe real props should go over to the folks at Suitcase
    Typefoundry, who won not only the typeface competition's gold medal, but also
    won the Jury Prize for the whole ED-Awards 2009 competition! Maybe this shows
    that good type is more important than logos or posters or brochures or anything
    else ;-D\r\n\r\n*Again, the site doesn't have details up for this, but Fedra Hindi
    is what Vinu is talking about. Go Satya!"

    because of the award, but rather just being at TYPO Berlin itself. The conference
    is one of my favorite events of the year, and being surrounded by such excellent
    colleagues is enough to mack one levitate with happiness, I think."
