body: I would love to know the typeface used for the title on the cover of Seventeen
  magazine. In my attachment, it's the pink lettering reading "seventeen". It's easy
  to find older covers on the internet, if you need more to investigate. Thanks to
  everyone who helps.

  body: "Apologies in advance if you already know that most big-budget magazines have
    custom-drawn nameplates. <a href=\"http://www.typedesign.com/\">Jim Parkinson</a>
    has made a career out of that kind of lettering work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said,
    this may well be typeface. There are certainly relatively common faces that are
    similar, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bodoni-rr-campanile/bodoni-rr-campanile/\">Bodoni
    Campanile.</a>\r\n\r\n"

    is pretty darn close. No need for manual obliquing.\r\n"

    is a match, Marc.
