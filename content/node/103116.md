    clearly so someone who already owns it doesn't accidentally buy it thinking its
    something new. You should also probably run it by your retailers first to see
    if there are any policies in place for that."

    set of characters to \"soften the transition\". That way, you can clearly point
    out functional differences -- perhaps it'll make owners of the \"old\" version
    buy the new name as well."

  body: Back in the day Letraset released a font and they named it "Playboy". They
    then changed it to "Plaza" without much fanfare. I suppose Hugh and his crowd
    took exception.
