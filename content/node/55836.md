  body: It's an old wood typeface. The one on the sample matches a version from the
    film font days called Winchester. The closest match I can find is Dennis Ortiz-Lopez's
    <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-smokler/">OL Smokler</a>.
    There are some differences, but it's basically the same. I think he created the
    lowercase, which didn't exist in the original.

  body: "I just posted a sample of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/16243939426/\">Winchester</a>
    along with some more info on the roots of this type, which goes back to Nesbitt\u2019s
    \u201CGothic\u201D\_of 1838. As Mark mentions, OL Smokler is just one digital
    interpretation of this wood type. This album art likely used phototype, such as
    Winchester or Morgan No. 25."
