  body: Dalliance does look correct. One of the more obvious differences is the lower
    case f. Does the font have alternate lettering in it like some open type fonts
    do?

  body: Somebody probably customized it. I have had to do the same. It's a beautiful
    font but there are some really unusable characters, like the f and the k. I find
    this often with Emigre fonts, unfortunately. It's very frustrating.

    of its characters. (Here's where Tiff usually says \"Yves! You and your quirks!\")
    :-D\r\n\r\nI used it extensively for headlines and maps for a travel brochure
    for world travels, aimed at older, well-to-do tourists. After the client set aside
    their initial reluctance and got used to it, they just loved it for its boldness,
    its strong personality and its subtle references to the times when traveling truly
    was an adventure.\r\n\r\nDon't maim beautiful faces, it's a crying shame. ;-)"
