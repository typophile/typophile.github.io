  in Dinamo magazine? It would have been in use around the turn of the century late
  1800s/ early 1900s.  Any ideas?:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2C273h4541270J3D2N1E/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-24%20at%2012.40.51%20PM.png\"></img>\r\n\r\nI
  know that it isn't the following typefaces (although they are wonderful and similar):\r\nTungsten,
  Knockout, Heroic Condensed, Dharma Gothic, nor is it Tall Skinny Condensed\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKelli\r\n\r\nPS-
  Agree with other commenters: it is difficult to avoid posting in the \"solved IDs\"
  section. Hoping that this post ends up in the correct place this time\u2026"

  body: "Given the age of the sample (turn of the 20th century) I doubt Tungsten etc.
    can be considered. I am thinking about a narrow variant of Monotype Grotesque
    (perhaps No. 77), while \"RIVISTA\" etc. could be a wider variant (No. 10?).\r\nAnother
    candidate for DINAMO is Advertisement Grotesque Condensed, also known as Narrow
    Grotesque, it had been around since 1865."

    for this project.)
