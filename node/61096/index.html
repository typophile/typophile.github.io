  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Strange question maybe but has been bugging me for a while: Does anyone ever make different optical sizes of logos – not necessarily the type, but the mark itself? And if not, why not?

Background: I'm currently working on a logo (and I don't think I can post it at the moment, so I'd appreciate a discussion on the "theoretical" level) that needs some detail that makes it vivid at large sizes (think company car decal) but gets lost at business-card sizes (at least on my printer).

So do you think there are any cogent reasons against making a "HD" and a "lo-fi" version of the same mark, one finer, the other more sturdy?</div>

One test I use during the design process is to make the logo an avatar size to see how it holds up. If you are losing important aspects something is wrong IMHO. A logo, by design, is suppose to be consistent and extremely flexible.

Note: I will sharpen low-res bitmap versions intended for use on a website and will completely recreate 16px x 16px 'fav icon' sizes.

CreativeNRG: Of course I'd agree, in principle, that logos are supposed to be scalable. BTW I would say that the logo in question works when scaled – no *crucial* detail is lost –, it just doesn't look its best at all sizes equally; and that got me wondering – if we're talking about the importance of optical scaling in type, shouldn't we accept its merits for logos as well – in terms of making the "HD" and the "lo-fi" version *optically* consistent/optimized instead of just mathematically scaled?

Kent, in this case it looks like I'll be in charge of most (if not all) of their printed materials myself, and will also be advising them on use of the logo in other media, so I can luckily have an eye on proper usage.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks 'TerminalDesign' for proving that example. However, I'd expect most of the optical adjustments were made in the tiny versions in the third row.

I'd like to clarify my previous point... Absolutely, you need to make those optical adjustments when you convert a vector logo (for print) into a very small bitmap logo (for web). To allow Photoshop to make your bicubic downsampling decisions for you would be insane.

If the logo stays in a vector format with a minimum size I don't see the need for another version. The version used on a business card can be scaled to go on the side of a semi trailer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jeff, it's to do with print resolution: I've seen the "large" version of the Palgrave symbol printed at about 4mm wide by mistake, and the little squares were fuzzy & indistinct. Much the same as having a display version of a font with fine lines, and then a "regular" text vesion, and maybe a "caption" version where the "thins" are chunkier so they don't get lost at small sizes. Just like you wouldn't set Big Caslon at 6pt. I'll see if I can fish out the relevant page of the branding guidelines document if you like.

I completely agree with everything you're saying but personally haven't seen a style guide that would allow you to use a logo at such a 'tiny' size. If you come across something I'd love to see how they deal with it.

I think your point about them using the wrong version of the logo goes to the initial question as to the down side of having too many versions of the logo for different situations. KISS... or someone is bound to F it up beyond belief at a big cost to someone.</div>

When I'm designing a logo I look at it from sub 1" to very large and everything in between before I show it to anyone.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Altaira,

An obvious example seems to me the current trend of 3D-ifying logos and adding subtle beveling and gradient to imply a slightly rounded look.

When used small, however, the '2D' or simply two-colour version can be used. For example, Apple's logo is this glassy blob thing writ large, but they can fall back on the simple silhouette Apple when using it small. Other examples include most car manufacturers (e.g. Ford, GM) and UPS have '3D' updated versions of their logos as well as the original '2D' versions. The extra detail does add some extra interest at large sizes. A Google images search will demonstrate any of the above examples.

Whether you agree with the trend is another matter. I heard a (possibly made-up) story that UPS commissioned Pentagram to explore possibilities for an update on their classic logo by Paul Rand. They racked up the allocated number of billable hours but eventually came back to UPS and presented them with all the reasons that their existing logo was a classic and shouldn't be fiddled with. UPS paid them but then went to FutureBrand to get their current 3D-effect shield with cliched swoosh and rounded-ish sans.

On a somewhat related note: 'How long should a logo last?' - Johnson Banks: http://www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/index.php?thoughtid=310
"Yellow Pages have cut the umbilical chord that held them to Futura and opted for one of those ubiquitous humanist soft sans serif solutions. Paradoxically, by opting to hit the more modern button they’ve traded long term stability for short-term refresh, but if that notches up a few better points in tracking, that may be deemed a success. There’s also a wry typographic twist there, as the typeface named after the future (Futura) is dumped for something of the present."

The different version of logos in the past (IBM was mentioned above) had a lot to do with different scales of use, not just printing at different sizes. A (1) top-of-the-building sign visible from miles away, through (2) car/truck/plane decals down to a (3) business card or a post stamp. Then different considerations again: (1) not black, because it needs to be illuminated at night, but a black & white line (no tone) version was needed for newspaper ads in letterpress. (2) not too much detail so it can be cut from vinyl or sprayed on with a stencil on 1000 trucks reasonably cheaply, (3) business cards and stationery were mostly printed in 1–2 colours, not full colour as often happens today.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jeff, I quite agree about KISS. In any big company, almost as soon as an identity is in place, people <em>who are not </em>[<em>professional</em>] <em>designers</em> will need to use elements of it. Many of them will not be aware of branding guidelines, nor of official versions of the logos on specific intranet sites (or whatever), and, when they realize they need to put the logo on item <em>x</em>, will extract it from the first item <em>y</em> that they can. "Different versions, what different versions?" It's inevitable as death & taxes.

Interesting, the elements in question in my logo are also thin-armed "stars", so structurally somewhat similar to the "spikes" in the Palgrave symbol.

Thanks Henry (zrenneh), good food for thought (being processed :-).

Bert:
<cite>"the concept is nice, but do not go there"</cite>
Wouldn't you say that depends on the situation though? I wouldn't usually consider this, but like I said in this case it looks like I might have pretty good control over how the logo will be used, at least initially.

I'll see the client today so will ask him if it might be okay for me to put the thing up for critique after all…</div>

Initially is the key word here. I don't know how the company you are designing for works, but usually the logos/style sheets I get are requested by a marketer and sent to them from another marketer. Have you ever dealt with marketers? A lot of times they cannot understand the difference between vector and "grab it off the web", especially now that the internet is such a focus. Yesterday I was sent a .png at 6.2K to "pop" in an InDesign presentation.

Then you have to consider the designer at the other end, are they going to read the style guide? And when they don't are the people at your company going to be sharp enough to recognize a violation?

Even at the 20 mm size it would present issues and I'd hate to see the results after it was printed in grayscale or color on newsprint at 85 or 100 lpi. Add in a touch of misregistration on press and you've got a major mess on your hands.

Do you know why they allow the logo to be printed that small? The majority of style guides prohibit scaling the logo anywhere near that size.

In a flash of brilliance I just figured out how to print the Palgrave mark at 7 pt.

Ahh, I have had some clients for years, some for over a decade, but none forever. So, that’s why I recommend to KISS.
But if *you* can, by all means go for specific files for specific usage.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, No - depends on the logo. If the logo has lot of details in it, one must optimize it for the small sizes. But then one should always avoid too many elements (details) in a logo, and have only one version so that it reduces the chances of its misuse in the future.

We (at Dalton Maag) made two versions for this logo* to make sure it works well also in the small sizes. You can see that all the thin strokes has been expanded a little in the second version so that they look same (optically) even at the different sizes.

<cite>A major drawback of the original logo was that its fine details made it hard to reproduce in smaller sizes. In an effort to remedy this problem, Hayman devised three marks: a highly detailed version for larger uses, a simplified version for smaller print pieces, and a logotype-only version for especially small applications such as book and CD spines.</cite>

Most publishers will want some version of their logo to go on spines. The big version's OK for an inch-thick textbook, but Palgrave publish journals too. Consider the thickness of a 64-page issue. (About 4mm, as it happens.)

LOL re that tiny version you typed. Find a font with an 8-pointed asterisk (I know I've seen a few) and that might be good idea!

I'm beginning to realize how lucky I am with my client in this case:
1) They're a very small company (less than ten people).
2) They're in a design/media related field, so they have (a) good eyes and (b) respect for design (and (c) are well aware of cross-media/resolution issues & such).
3) They love the logo.
That said, I can see how in most/many cases the optical sizing thing wouldn't be very practicable. I've gotten enough 72k GIFs as logos to print on posters myself…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Most corporations I've done design work for don't have different versions for different sizes. 

Multiple versions sounds good in theory, but it complicates things and creates the possibility that vendors or employees will use the wrong version. 

Most employees can't even select the right fonts or colors, let alone pick the right logo version. And when working with an outside vendor they may send them the wrong logo version.

I'd agree there are occasional instances where it makes sense, but most professional logos are designed to look good large or small, and are scalable vector files.

Agreed 100%.

When I redesigned the Extensis logo a few years ago, I really wanted to do two optical sizes, maybe even three. The one for tiny sizes would use subtly bolder letters, and they would be just slightly more loosely spaced. The one for big sizes would use just subtle tighter spacing and thinner lines.

But I came to the conclusion that people would use the wrong ones sometimes, there was no way that I could stop that from happening, and the downside was bigger than the benefit.</div>

Years ago a new client emailed their logo. We thought it looked heavy, but she said it was correct. Found out after the job was printed that she sent the version intended for small sizes.

Clients aren't designers and they make mistakes. I've seen pasteup boards cut in 2 (cut right through the type) to fit into a filing cabinet. One client had a secretary who modified their logo with a felt-tip pen on a newsletter they mailed out (she said she was "improving" it).</div>

They should read the guidebook. I've made a few in my career so far. I designed the logo for a logistic company called Tunderman. The main logo is quite detailed and is presented in big on trucks. I knew it was going to be problematic at small sizes so I designed a secondary one with fewer details and described in the guidebook which logo should be used in which context and I put restrictions on the size for both optical variants. For extra clarity I put both designs in the same Illustrator file with information on the sizes. If the wrong logo is still being used, that's not a simple mistake anymore; someone has to be incredibly incompetent to make that happen.</div>

But I've found that most clients aren't knowledgable about their company's graphic standards manual. They've got a hundred other things on their mind and use the wrong colors, fonts, artwork, etc. I've seen it over and over again. 

One of the frustrating things about graphic manuals (and I've designed several) is that professional designers generally don't need it other than basic info on fonts, colors, etc.; they already know what they're doing. And graphic amateurs like employees either don't read it or don't understand it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm quite surprised to hear this. I can completely understand most people won't know which optical variant of text to use and I can also understand mixing up RGB with CMYK, but selecting different fonts, artwork, entirely different colors or using the wrong optical logo is sheer incompetence. They should read the guidebook (which they didn't do or the mistake wouldn't be made) or ask if something isn't clear. I understand they have other things on their mind, but a company should hire people who are involved with how the company presents itself and so things like this shouldn't happen. The companies I worked for always have elaborate processes for checking mistakes involving several people. I still often spot typographic errors and at times grammar mistakes but I think that's quite forgivable. Some mistakes just slip in and go unnoticed. Using the wrong optical logo, a different font or different colors is much less forgivable. There's a big difference between making a human mistake and being incompetent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To be fair I should mention that a lot of the mistakes I see are in business-to-business pieces (for example materials prepared for a business presentation made to another company). These pieces are important and the rules should be followed, but frequently they aren't.

Most corporate pieces seen by the general public are prepared by professionals who hopefully read the manual. But most manuals tend towards being straightjackets rather than guidelines. I remember once helping prepare a graphics guide for a corporation, and then the first piece we did for them we wanted to violate several of our own rules!

Okay, that's probably not a good practice, though a guidebook is to guide you, not to enforce you. I think if you're a capable designer it's okay to break some rules at times. You obviously wouldn't want to mess up the consistency of the design, but following the guidelines exactly can be very restricting and may even restrict the quality of the design.

I think essentially a guidebook should guide capable designers while it tells the non-designers or less capable ones what to do exactly. I think this is a general principle, too: amateur designers will probably fair better when they follow the principles of design while an experienced one may dare to break them. There's a great distinction between not following rules due to ignorance and breaking them consciously. The former often leads to bad design while the latter may be daring and ingenious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, I've never heard of such big design manuals. To some extent it seems ridiculous to define so many fonts for Christmas cards. I'm assuming with so many fonts there is barely any consistency to be noticed in the typography, so just define a few fonts and give the designer some liberties. I really can't imagine any company actually needs a design manual that big. Am I wrong in thinking that?</div>
