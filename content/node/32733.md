  body: "I think this might have been made using two fonts. I think the lower case
    could be Kauffmann using l's for the t's. The S looks similar to many of the Benguiat-esque
    photolettering scripts,although it curls up a bit more than Frisky.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Hhmmm the kaufmann font makes sense, i kinda thought it had a "Fender" feel
    to it. And seeing kaufmann, fender, stutter logo those letters look a lot alike.
