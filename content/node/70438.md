body: I have searched several sites trying to find the ID of the font on these jerseys.  I'm
  pretty sure the numbers and the letters are the same font.  Can anyone help me ID
  this font?  Thanks in advance.

    one I''m not sure, but if you just google "collegiate font" you will come across
    many that are close: http://www.fontspace.com/category/college'

  body: 'Ya, I''m looking for the font that is used on the numbers.  I couldn''t 100%
    figure out if the font on the front of the jersey is the same as what is used
    for the #''s.  The main thing I''m concerned with is the shadowing on the #''s,
    or 3D effect, that it has.  I''m wondering if there is that particular font out
    there that is shadowed like that.'

    are solid vector shapes, no opacity or anything, so that leads me to believe that
    the type for \"CLEAVAGE CREW\" is possibly done in Illustrator. It would be easy
    to do either way, so without finding the exact face there's no way of knowing."
