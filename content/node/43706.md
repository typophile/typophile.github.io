body: When spacing your majuscules, do you test them in all-caps format, or space
  them against the minuscules and then fix all-caps problems with kerning? And when
  you test the spacing of all-caps, is it best to do so at sizes larger than what
  would be used for text as users are more likely to use all caps in titles and headlines?
