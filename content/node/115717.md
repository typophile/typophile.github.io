  wondering what are those fonts, used in that logo. The store is Cigarette Store
  in Tampere and every time I walk past that logo, I keep wondering of those fonts.
  Especially letter \"K\" in the third row. I'm designer myself and this is really
  disturbing that I can't identify those fonts. :D\r\n\r\nSo, can you help me? I'm
  looking for both fonts.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!"
