  and I'm having a difficult finding a match for 'Ricky Steamboat'. Does anyone happen
  to recognize it offhand?\r\n\r\nI was able to match 'The Dragon' to a font titled
  Arnold Boecklin, so I'm at least halfway there. \r\n\r\nAny help you could offer
  is truly greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/28s8209_4301.jpg]"
