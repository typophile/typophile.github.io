  Fillit.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing fancy, new or groundbreaking \u2013\_being very novice
  in type design I did it as an excercise for myself only. The design goal is to create
  display font for newspaper section headlines that has 1. slab serif general form
  2. has plenty of pop = lot of ink per character 3. can form very tight headlines
  without letters touching each other. 4. to be used in >72 pt\r\n\r\nThere's a brief
  specimen attached. I haven't finished all the characters \u2013 trying to finish
  smaller set before doing too much work.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to be crude :)"

  body: I like it. My only critique is that the U is to small and it should have straight
    serifs. You need just a little bit wider spacing. Good Luck.

  body: "Continuing with this project... here are side by side comparisons with original
    (left) that inspired me to try to design better solution.\r\nI didn't like the
    way they used overlapping in letter spacing and tried to create something that
    doesn't touch but still has the same impact as the original. Check it out. Any
