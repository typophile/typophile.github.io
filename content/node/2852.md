  body: James, Thank you, this is so great... I typed in my question and relaxed for
    the rest of the evening. And in the morning I have my answer. My theory of &#34;design
    elves&#34; has finally been validated.  <BR> <BR>Thanks also for going the extra
    step to create and post a sample. I appreciate it. Alyce
