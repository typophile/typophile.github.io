  didn't grab the font name with the screenshot. I thought it might have been dafont.com
  but went back in there and checked all there fonts but couldn't locate it. I've
  also tried identifont.com and1001fonts.com without luck.\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify
  this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryfont_5011.png]"
