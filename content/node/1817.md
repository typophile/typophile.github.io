    thing that isn&#39;t quite right &#40;that I can see&#41; is the uppercase N non-italic
    narrow bold of Tarzana is different to the N that appears above &#40;CRBEN!&#41;.
    Perhaps this is a customisation... <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your speedy response

    with the &#39;set text&#39; &#40;typetease&#41; feature, and the N was different...
    kind of a weird angle at the bottom... I swear! Anyway, I checked the character
    set, and it&#39;s exactly the same. Ooops. '
