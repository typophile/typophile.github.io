  body: "Pretty close, but there are some differences. The image has slab/angled serifs,
    \r\nDecorated 035 has Clarendon style cove serifs and the bottom of the J is more
    rounded. \r\nThe problem is that we are examining to an image you drew rather
    than an original image. Close examination of the original is required to determine
    the shape of the serifs. If they are in fact Clarendon style, then Decorated 035
    is a good candidate for a match.\r\nBTW Bistream's Decorated 035 is actually a
    font designed by Eugen Lenz and Max Lenz in 1946 and sold by Haas as Profil.\r\nDon"

  body: Hi Don. Thanks - I knew Decorated 035 was not the original name, but I did
    not have my reference books in front of me to check, and couldn't remember it
    off the top of my head. I've since spotted it in my Jaspert.

  body: "Hi Andrew, yes Jaspert is gold for font detectives. Some errors, but nothing
    else comes close for digging into metal type IDs. To bad it does not have a good
    category index. Have to go though it page by page to find the Ah-Ha moment. As
    for this font, I can't understand why Lenz & Lenz released Profil only as a sloped
    font. Why not a regular vertical version too? Go figure, mind-reading the past
    is a mugs game...\r\nDon"

  body: Getting inside the mind of the designers of the past is a necessary (if somewhat
    subjective) part of type revival, and an interesting exercise in itself for someone
    like me for whom type has not been a vocation. I agree on the various faults of
    the Jaspert volume, but it does beat sifting through endless, musty old type specimen
    books from the world's many former metal type foundries - though some of these
    are now available as free pdf downloads. I also have the Rookledge, covering the
    most popular faces of the phototypesetting age. But this has even more egregious
    faults than the Jaspert, providing no background information on a typeface's origins
    - designer, date or foundry - even though there is a better categorization.
