  wrinkles, so thanks for your patience. This upgrade will make it possible to add
  new features and help speed things up a little as well.

  body: I think you did a great job in updating the website so that you will be able
    to serve the people more. Have you heard the latest buzz over the James Cameron
    film Avatar, but the latest rumor and talk about the science fiction epic is that
    it is racist. Obviously, there are contingents of people out there with too much
    free time and not enough intelligence, but the story goes that James Cameron and
    Avatar are racist because the hero is white and male and saves a non-Caucasian
    alien race, which is less militaristic, industrial with a more egalitarian culture.
    By that logic, so is Dances with Wolves, and Lawrence of Arabia, yet those films
    aren't pilloried as such. Honestly, serious people would give payday loans at
    least to make such ill-conceived arguments go away.

    does not shows the Author's name - it just says \"guest\". Also, there is a thread

    - how come it's showing in my track list then? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5788.jpg]"

    pushed down some roads of intense creativity. Man 'o' man, what a trip! Couldn't
    socialize, couldn't move away from the creative process, I could barely eat -
    sleep when exhausted. At the end of it all I managed to open doors into many different
    worlds.\r\nIncluding getting a shot to have my type based sculpture (which I created
    and built over the last two years!) shown in our National Gallery up here in Canada!
    Presentation coming up in early May. \r\n\r\nIntense crazy run. I'm still a little
    wobbly. But feel well and chatty. I was formally known as Hiroshige / Hiro. Great
    to see some familiar faces still kickin' 'round these hallowed halls."

  body: Oops when I track myself only one page of listings of threads appear, all
    by some "Guest". Two years of threads I participated in are gone, and I have not
    posted anything in half of the ones that do appear ! Good luck unscrambling it
    all, and thanks for the effort. While you are at it why not get rid of that gray
    background and make the font a bit larger for us old fogies to read more comfortably?
