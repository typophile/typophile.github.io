  body: "The freehand Neiman Marcus trademark has been around for at least 70 years
    (see ad from <em>Vogue</em> in 1944, when you could buy a chic outfit from Neiman
    Marcus and still get change back from a fifty). It has undergone many small modifications
    over the years, and somewhere along the line they dropped the hyphen.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neiman-marcus-1944_5740.jpg]"
