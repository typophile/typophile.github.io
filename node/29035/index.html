  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is there a better way to draw an italic typeface? Vertical or Inclined BCP? Whatever the technic we choose, is this has an influence on the print output? Is there some advantage to work with one or other way? As an example I've choose Agenda light (left side) and Parisine Clair (right side).

		<div class="commentbody">Both of those have good and bad features, beyond the issue of extrema you're bringing up. The Agenda one has a nice little trap, but it has: a "dead-BCP" tangent point (left side of the counter) and messy extrema situations on its right. The former* is bad because some rasterizers (as well as some conversions from cubic to quadratic bezier**) will choke on it - although it's pretty rare. As for the latter, I would guess it was caused by mechanically slanting an upright form, smartly adding extrema, but then not cleaning up the former extrema; it's not necessarily bad, but it's likely to exhibit a mild wobble sometimes; the extra points are too close to the  extrema to have any potential curve-defining role, instead unnecessarily introducing the risk of wobble due to -unavoidable- grid discretization. The Parisine one has clean extrema, but it also has a dead-BCP point. In addition -but this is really minor- it has a "projection overlapping" BCP in the top-left outside curve of the bowl.*** I also don't like its weight distribution (to me it looks too light on the bottom-right) but that's not [necessarily] a technical issue, certainly not a bezier integrity issue.

* Which also might be the case on one of the points inside the trap.

** Think FOG, or more notably Flash.

*** From what I know the only issue with this is it can make a curve segment look somewhat ungainly, because it pushes the middle of the curve too hard from the sides, if you know what I mean; and with some shifting of BCPs it can be avoided. But I'm not aware that it can ever cause any actual tangible problems.
