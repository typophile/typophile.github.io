<p>I&rsquo;ve been commissioned to design a diary for a university. HFJ &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; reminds me of old timetables a wee bit, so that&rsquo;s my current candidate for the body text, but I still need a display face for headers and maybe 20pt-size-ish dates.</p>
<p>So can anyone think of a display face that has connotations of time, timekeeping, or numbers? Please nothing that is overtly specific to a specific technology like a font where each character is a digital watch or anything like that :)</p>

<p>I agree with the condensed didone idea, though many clocks that use arabic numerals use a fat face. As far as timetables go, something like Trade Gothic would be standard, but wouldn&rsquo;t have that connotation out of context. Maybe also Roman inscriptional capitals, inline or not, as reminiscent of the carved numbers on sundials, etc.</p>

The roman numerals old clockface idea is nice, but I don&rsquo;t think it smacks of a clock unless I actually use roman numerals. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want to do that, as (a) it looks a wee bit pretentious (b) international students might not get it (c) dates are generally always in arabic numbers, at least in the UK.</p>
<p>@Joshua Langman
Hm. Aptly named, but not aptly styled.</p>
<p>@Té Rowan 
Timetables in the vicinity are boring. Boring, boring, boring! Some worker at the local council doing it in Microsoft Word. Then again I do live in Glasgow, perhaps some research into London timetable design history is in order. I might never get the project done if I start that though.</p>
<p>@Nick Shinn
Oof, that is really nice. Tiny budget probably won&rsquo;t stretch to a new font. I might have a go at playing with Computer Modern, which in a roundabout way seems appropriate when a lot of students will be seeing articles written in LaTeX. I could show them a classy, InDesign-ed up use of their research paper typeface ;)</p>

<p>How many copies? Could you tea-stain them by hand? If you have a color printer, could you print a light shade of yellow or a scanned image of old paper in the background?</p>
<p>Could you print something you make with all those free old-fashioned Adobe wood type fonts and then photocopy-degrade it until it looks like overinked metal type?</p>
<p>Are you still looking for font suggestions are are you stuck with what you have?</p>
<p>Actually, &ldquo;time&rdquo; to me suggests type carved into cold, monumental stone, with sharp shadows. What if you took Trajan or something and placed it over a stone background and played with the InDesign effects to emboss it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is b&amp;w and no chance of alternate paper stocks. Copier paper greyscale it is, though it will have a full colour and full bleed card cover. So there&rsquo;s room for establishing a style there before continuing it in black and white throughout. I love the idea of tea-staining each diary but that would be laborious for six thousand copies or thereabouts, and I doubt the university admin would let it fly.</p>
<p>@Ryan not many times will be listed at display size, mostly dates appearing as &ldquo;15&rdquo; and &ldquo;May 2012&rdquo; with everything else at 10pt body text size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If the pages are designed to look old, what time period would be appropriate? Some of these suggestions imply pages that look extremely old (wood type, etc), but the original poster mentioned &ldquo;a 1950s diner&rdquo; which is obviously much more recent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately this is b&amp;w and no chance 
of alternate paper stocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If buying paper stock that already looks old (such as parchment paper) isn&rsquo;t an option, you can create that look via artwork. Old paper darkens from the outside edges in. You can create this look using photoshop (there are tutorials on the internet), or you can purchase ready-made artwork for a few bucks at stock photography sites like iStockPhoto.com. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parchment2_3950.jpg]</p>
<p>The example above (which is color but could easily be converted to black and white) looks very old. If you&rsquo;re simulating paper from the 1950s, the effect would need to be much more subtle, with paper the looks good except for a slight darkening near the paper edges.</p>
<p>However be sure that you can print from edge to edge. If the effect stops short of the paper&rsquo;s edge it&rsquo;ll ruin the effect.</p>
