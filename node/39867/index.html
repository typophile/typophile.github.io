  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typohiles,

This is my first post -- I've been learning from watching you smart folks for months, and now I'm in a situation where I could use a little of your expertise...

I am doing the titling for a documentary about a trip to a childrens orphanage in Africa and the director is in love with Papyrus. I can't stand the font (and from doing a papyrus thread search, I've gathered that most of you feel the same way).

Can anyone suggest some Papyrus alternatives? The font will be used for names of people and places, as well as short & long quotes. 

I've been scouring my library and myfonts.com for something that I might be able sell to the director as a better alternative -- perhaps something elegant, friendly, and with a slightly "african" feel -- but I thought I would put the question to you, the ultimate type experts.

Thanks in advance for your time, and any input is very much appreciated.

Regards,
Julia</div>

Chase - Thanks for the suggestion, but I think it's a little too... um... "clean"? not sure of the right descriptor here :/

Kent - Kigali might be close, maybe something with less extreme thicks & thins?  I'm looking at some of Arthur Baker's other fonts right now, and leaning towards <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/pelican/familytree.html">Pelican</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glyph/oakgraphic/familytree.html">Oakgraphic</a> Thanks for turning me to Arthur Baker... not quite my taste in type, but I need to satisfy the director's desires while not succumbing to the ubiquitous Papyrus.

Still searching... any other suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks again,
Julia</div>

I think that <a href="http://www.linotype.com/113189/palatinosansinformal-family.html">Palatino Sans</a> certainly meets the first to qualifications, i'm not sure if you can ever really "feel" Africa in a typeface, but i don't think Palatino Sans would be too far off this mark either.

		<div class="commentbody">I can't thank you all enough for the many excellent suggestions here.

Paul - thank you for the gentle correction, I realized after posting that using the word "African" as an adjective was inaccurate and a little on the ignorant side. I should have come back to correct myself, but got carried away with work. Thanks for not flaming me :)

James - I am in complete agreement with you, and am trying to steer the director and editor down a different road by giving some other options. But showing them an alternative to Papyrus that is close will at least demonstrate that I am listening to them as well.

Plato does look like a great alternative, and I am loving the hand-lettered Olduvai as well -- especially because it is a film about a travelling performing arts camp, with emphasis on hands-on artistic expression and experience. Palatino would be great for smaller/longer bits of text, perhaps to pair with another more overtly stylized display font?

...I'm interested in every font suggested here -- I've got some work to do!

Thank you all again, your feedback has helped immensely.

		<div class="commentbody">Brioso Pro Poster: Lighter than Papyrus, but has the same rough edge. This typeface is pure elegance and looks great at 300pt. They do have other cuts for smaller sizes. EDIT:Not african feeling though (to me).

EDIT: Olduvai is not intended to feel African in any way. The archeology angle is a big burial mound of schtick that my *ahem* marketing team came up with.

Side note: I did draft up a font a couple of years ago in the flavor Neuland (but more calligraphic). I was chuckling because if you want it to be "ethnic" choose Neuland. Hawaiian? Check. African? Check. Amazon? Check. I'm not saying, mind you that this makes any sense, or has any cultural sensitivity, but Neuland is pretty unique in it's ability to resonate with so many people on this level. It's called Indigenous, and it is growing cobwebs. Somehow, whenever I set out to draw a display face, it evolves into some crazy long project with text companion and blah blah blah.

The discussion about type parody vs cultural sensitivity is an interesting one, that I don't want to side track. Type parody might be damaging in a butterfly flaps its wings in Montana and a typhoon strikes Mauritius kind of way. Some will argue that type parody is directly offensive and damaging. I just don't have a good answer, you have to pick a typeface. Chances are you're awareness of the design history and use of a font will be lost subtleties on most audiences. Still, not sure that means you need to go find a font that Joe Starbucks will overtly say is Tiki lettering. But then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89239849@N00/1253968262">Tiki lettering has it's place</a>. Like I said, I don't have a good answer. Just go with Olduvai. Muuuuuuhahahahahahahaha. Or not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Florian: thanks for posting that article. It caused quite a bit of introspection. I do think that Indigineous panders to caracature, but it was not intended to be hurtful, but playful. It was helpful to learn more about the climate that Neuland was introduced into, and who adopted it. Also to read more about the deco connection, which I wasn't aware of, but which shows up in my design more overtly. Probably not a bad thing that it stays on my hard drive. I wonder what others think about that. I honestly don't care. As far as it depends on me, I want to be about peace.</div>
