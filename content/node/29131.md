body: I'm working on a project that calls for type to be drawn on an angle, rising
  from left to right. Is there a face out there that is designed for this sort of
  thing, or should I do the letters by hand/alter an existing face?

  body: I know how it's done, but I'm just wondering if there's a font out there that
    was actually designed to be displayed that way in the first place. It's for a
    school project and I want to have a good response to professorial whinging about
    how one should never skew type.

    been, that is designed with your application in mind.\r\n\r\nHowever, an italic
    might serve. \r\n\r\nShould the angle required deviate from the natural angle
    of the italic then you can at least inform the whingeing professor that you started
    with the correct source material."

  body: A simple oblique would be better than a true italic, which has different letterforms
    from the upright letters. Lots of italics designed for early sans typefaces were
    simple obliques, which used the same letterforms as the uprights. These of course
    have the optical corrections to adjust for the effects of skewing.

    on the page or even cropped can be impactful. The only font (metal) that I can
    think of that did vaguely what you want was a sans in a ribbon that was extremely
    complicated to use, I only ever saw it in its case, but the intention was that
    you could create an angled setting in a ribbon or scroll, it had elaborate endings
    for the ribbons and required top and bottom packing to set. There are also logotypes
    of common words \u2013\_the, for sale etc.\r\nTim"

  body: "There are, of course, hand-lettering alphabets meant to be drawn in the way
    you describe, and no shortage of old hand-painted signs whose glyphs rise or fall.\r\n\r\nMost
    of the letterpress shops I've been in have a few drawers full of electroplated
    letterpress cuts that run at an angle, mostly of company names and advertising
    terms. There are also probably a number of pieces of triangular type furniture,
    used for locking up these odd-shaped blocks. I would wager that someone, somewhere
    out there, has drawn a digital font that does this, and you can probably find
    printed reproductions of an angled alphabet in a book. Start with the Dover Press
    letterpress clip art series.\r\n\r\nI recently came across a font of <em>angled</em>
    type in which the body of each character was rhomboid in plan, not rectangular,
    as it would be in a conventional face. It was part of a mixed-media piece, made
    up of found type and electroplated company logos, at the Smithsonian American
    Art Museum. I can't remember that artist, but I'll try to get a name and a photo
    next time I'm down there. It looked something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/angled-type_4557.png]\r\n\r\nFig.
    1 is what ordinary letterpress type looks like, in plan form, and Fig. 2 is the
    way that normal type prints.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is the angled type that I saw in the
    museum. It was set like this, on a baseline parallel to the bottom of the piece.
    Note the angled slugs at either side. If printed, it would look like Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nIf
    you had the right type furniture, you could set these letters like Fig. 5, running
    at an angle. This would print like Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n"

    There are certainly fonts that can be slanted without unacceptable distortions.
