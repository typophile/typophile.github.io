body: "I was wondering if extreme inktraps, like the ones you find in certain designs
  like Amplitude of Bell Centennial, sometimes become a design element in serif typefaces.
  Does anybody know any typefaces which have them? Farnham has them to a certain extent,
  do you know of any others.\r\n\r\nD."
