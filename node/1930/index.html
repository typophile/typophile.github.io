  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I need some advice pushing my design career into next level. I have an undergrad degree in Biochemisry and a grad certificate from Museum School (boston). I started as an intern in a small studio, and gradually became a full time designer for 2 years. Besides, I was taking courses at MassArt as well. As I have gained more experience and increasingly devoted myself to design, I desperately want to push myself, both conceptual and executional skills, into next level. I have huge passion in design. Now I am wondering what my next step should be. Should I go to grad school? If so, which school? (I have few in mind, ie SVA, RISD, or Portfolio Center.) Or should I just keep working in the real business world? Which experience is more rewarding? <BR>I do have foundation skills in design and business interaction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have hooked on this site and speak up. I got so much valuable insights.  The sense of sharing feels so great. <BR> <BR>I have read some info on the grad programs, each school has a very different vison. Some are very theoretical-based, ie RISD. I assume a student will gain lots of exploratory pleasure in those programs.  But, as I read more about Portfolio Center, the program is very pratical and fun. This might help if I want to launch a better career. mh&hellip;I donno&hellip;just confused&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ling, I went to RISD for undergraduate school and had an amazing experience. However, my opinion of the grad students was not as good. My freshman year most of them seemed very intelligent and dedicated, however; by the time I was a senior, the new crop of them seemed uninterested in doing any work or learning anything, only in getting a degree (not all of them, if they are reading this and know where I live. Seriously). Overall, my opinion of the grad program there is mixed. If you're very dedicated to learning, and look for the teachers who will give you the best education, then it might be worth it. I hear Tom Ockerse is a great guy to work with. But I've heard that Yale has a better reputation as a grad school for graphic design and is very similar to the RISD undergraduate program. <BR> <BR>Yes, RISD is conceptual and will help you with your execution. But it really depends on how much you're willing to push yourself. The more practical stuff - such as learning computer programs, collaborating with clients and printers - isn't what they teach. At least, they didn't teach stuff like that for more than a day when I was there. There were seminars, but we were so overloaded with homework no one had time to go. But that kind of stuff is the kind of thing you learn with experience - the experience you probably already have.  <BR> <BR>Providence is a fantastic city with a great arts scene. I love Boston more, but I still miss little Rhody. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you can possibly afford it, go to the place and talk to students and teachers. Your face to face intuition tells you so much that is important that you can't get from brochures.   <BR> <BR>If you are thinking of European schools, that might be more difficult, but actually flying to Europe is probably no more expensive than to California from Boston.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A school is only as good as the instructors that are there at the time you attend. Do you have a specialty you wish to pursue, e.g., illustration, or typography? I'd shop around for people that are exceptional teachers in your specialty. A Masters degree would allow you to teach, but I'm not sure if that's what you're after.  <BR> <BR>There's a book out you might check out called &quot;The Education of a Graphic Designer&quot; by Steven Heller. <BR> <BR>Art schools focus more on concept in upper division classes. But that assumes you have the prerequisites of being able to draw well, have a good background in color theory and art history, cognitive skills, plus decent computer skills. And don't forget business classes, Lord know how many designers go under each year from poor business practices.</div>
