  regarding typography.\r\n\r\nThe dance studio caters to an eclectic genres of dancing\u2014ballroom,
  salsa, hip-hop, swing, tango, zumba, latin, flamenco, and other style of dances
  I am not familiar with. The typography has to appeal to a broad audience of dancer
  and encapsulate a whimsical feel.\r\n(man, i sound like my worst client)\r\n\r\nCan
  i get a few suggestions?\r\nThanks in advance for all of your feedbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't think you can solve this kind of a problem with just a typeface.\r\nYou
    have to have some idea of how you are going to set it.\r\nWhimsy suggests, for
    instance, an old-style face with an ostensibly conservative personality, set large
    without much leading, on a narrow measure."

  body: "Nick, thanks for your thoughtful insights. I guess I am still trying to formulate
    the feel.\r\nI was thinking of going the route of a signature logotype but my
    budget does not permit a calligrapher.\r\nI don't want to go with a generic hand
    written typeface."

  body: "Oh, I thought you were after a general typographic look, not a logo/wordmark.\r\nIf
    you are thinking of a script wordmark, you should consider an OpenType script
    with contextual glyph substitutions, which will give more of the look of custom
    calligraphy. Veer and House are good places to look for such things. (Not to mention
    my own Handsome.)\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, you will be able to preview these effects
    at the new MyFonts."
