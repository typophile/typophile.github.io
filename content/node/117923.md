  body: "Perhaps handwritten with Adorn as a model. There seems to be some variation
    in letters that are unlikely to be caused by stylistic alternatives in a font.
    For example do a close comparison of _A_ in Anne and Alan.\r\nDon"

  body: "Given that it's only two lines of type and there are more variations than
    can be accounted for by stylistic alternates, I think Don is correct--this was
    most likely hand-lettered by a calligrapher.\r\n\r\nAlana achieves the same feel,
    and Laura Worthington has other fonts in the same style. Here's a link to a site
    that also lists similar fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/similar/laura-worthington/alana"
