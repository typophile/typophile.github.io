  and I have recently finished creating my first completed font. It's a TrueType font.
  It's a highly original and stylish display type of font. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I was thinking
  I was gonna try to make some money with it, and was wondering if anyone out there
  could offer some guidance and advice. Anything I should know about finding and working
  with a distributor? Do I need to make them sign something to keep from getting ripped
  off if they prove to be scandalous? (I'm always suspicious I guess)  \r\n\r\nI'd
  rather not have to market it myself even if I had my own website, setting up a shopping
  cart system etc..\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: MyFonts and Fontspring are the way to go. Easy to work with, a high royalty
    rate, and they sell more fonts than the vendors with lower royalty rates.
