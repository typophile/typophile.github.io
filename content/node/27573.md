  get you into the picture: \r\nI've been ask to redesign the Identity of a web design,
  development hosting, marketing etc. company based in mauritius (www.eservices.mu).
  Its a small agency aiming high, they want to be the leader in the sector in mauritius
  and looking forward to export their services. They want to be seen as professionals,
  reliable, proactive and responsive.\r\n\r\nThis what i've come with.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think guys?\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\nJean-Lou D\xE9sir\xE9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "the logo looking pretty nice ..but im not satisfied with the alignment of
    the word \"serveices\"..as its neighter in the center of the circled \"e\" nor
    in the aligned to the bottom of the same(e). and thats y its looking a bit unbalanced.
    And the circled \"e\" is too big. You have just scaled up the normal proportion
    of \"e\" to make it bigger..try to reduce its thickness to the thickness of the
    word\"services\".\r\n\r\nSatya"

  body: "the e wasn't readily identifiable, but I'm not sure if that matters. It's
    certainly readable within the name of the company.\r\n\r\nThat said, I read it
    as 'services' with a round logo.\r\n\r\nYou might want so spell out 'eservices'
    completely.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'd suggest they pick a better name than 'eservices'.
    That's sort of like calling the company 'web design'. But I'm guessing that's
    a different battle. ;o)"

  body: lol. Unfortunately I read the company name as "services" and the circle thing
    just looks like a logo mark with a letter g in it.

    at first sight, if someone dont see the word services first. \r\n\r\n>>To solve
    this, you can use the letter 'c' to make 'e'.\r\n\r\n-I wanna see the letter 'g'
    of the same typeface. Can you show me?\r\n\r\nsatya"

      issue with the 'e' that look like a 'g'.  \r\n\r\nI'll post the modif soon.\r\n\r\nSatya:
      I havn't got any design of 'g' yet.\r\n"

  body: "You could simply make an uppercase E, by trimming the right of the lowercase
    e. Also you could look at the r, whose form is making a large space with the v,
    maybe cutting the curve and closing the rvi kerning. Ultimately the look is attractive
    and <em>fairly</em> modern, I think this logo will date fairly quickly, which
    I suppose is part of the nature of the business it is serving.\r\nTim"

  body: "Im fully agree with timd. you can solve your all the confusions just by making
    the 'e' capital..anyway your all letters looks like caps except 'e' and 'r'. I'll
    say make 'r' capital too..so that the white space between v and r also get balanced.\r\n"

  body: At first glance the 'e' seemed to me a modified '8'. I also agree with the
    earlier post about spelling out e-sevices. If I hadn't first read your post, I'm
    not sure I would have made the connection between the mark and services.

  body: "The issue is that a capital E isn't what the world uses for 'e-whatever'.\r\n\r\nemail,
    eMac, eBook, eCommerce, etc.\r\n\r\nthe lower case 'e' (as well as the 'i') have
    come to mean 'we're an internet company'. Cliche, indeed, but if you are going
    with the cliche, one probably needs to stick with it, and keep it lowercase."

  body: jeanlou...the first one of your revisions is the one to go with, as it definitely
    reads as an 'e'. The others still have that ackward hump that distort the character
    enough to not quite look like an e.
