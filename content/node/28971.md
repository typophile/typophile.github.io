body: "I am looking into th origins of Stempel garamond and from what I understand
  it was adapted in 1924 from a specimen sheet by Egenolff-Berner from 1592 (Frankfurt).
  The garamond's type used to make this specimen sheet where aquired by Jacques Sabon
  from the Plantin print shop in Antwerp. I am wondering where this sheet is being
  kept and if there is a way to get a digital copy of it. All I could find online
  was this crappy gif.\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: There is a copy of an Egenolff-Berner specimen in the Sabon Next brochure,
    from Linotype. If you e-mail me offline, I might be able to send you a copy of
    that. Don't know where the original is yet, though. Maybe in the Gutenberg Museum
    in Mainz? They have a good old Frankfurt specimen collection.
