body: "Hi, \r\nI posted a request earlier this week for the top 20 influential typefaces.
  After reading the numerous helpful replies I\u2019ve come to realise that my question
  was a little ambiguous. Rather than typefaces that have influenced other typefaces,
  I was instead more interested in the top 20 typefaces that have impacted upon the
  design world itself.\r\nAfter this reflection my list now looks a little more like
  this:\r\n\r\n-\tHelvetica\r\n-\tGaramond\r\n-\tUnivers\r\n-\tBembo\r\n-\tTimes\r\n-\tFutura\r\n-\tOptima\r\n-\tBodoni\r\n-\tGill
  Sans\r\n-\tFrutiger\r\n-\tOCR\r\n-\tCooper Black\r\n-\tMyriad\r\n-\tFranklin Gothic\r\n-\tRockwell\r\n-\tMrs
  Eaves\r\n-\tAvant Garde\r\n-\tBaskerville\r\n-\tCaslon\r\n-\tDax\r\n\r\nThanks for
  all your comments on my other post and again I\u2019d value your opinions and feedback
  on this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I don''t think Times has had impact. Perhaps you mean fonts that have been
    HUGE and so over-used that one can''t use them without thinking of that time period?
    Your list could be fine-tuned. For instance, Futura Ex-Bold Condensed instead
    of just Futura. I''d use Didot instead of Bodoni, but I''m thinking of Bazaar
    magazine, Italian Vogue, and Madonna''s...  well her "book". You are missing Meta
    and Avant Garde. Myriad, OCR, and Bembo... not so much. ITC Garamond, as much
    as we loathe it, was huge when it was released. Bell Gothic lead the way, IMHO,
    to our loving weird traps (Amplitude) and Freight Micro. I''d not include Rockwell
    but would include Lubalin. Caslon 540 perhaps. '

    as to how a revival of a popular style\u2014Mrs. Eaves\u2014is influential. It\u2019s
    not like Mrs. Eaves was released and a whole generation of designers suddenly
    discovered Baskerville. And why is Bembo on there as opposed to any other similar
    Renaissance book face? This list seems largely arbitrary."

    Type, in that the designer of the publication also designed the typeface for it.

    with a particular face in mind, or start to work with a font in a layout, and
    modify the layout accordingly."

  body: "I agree with James Puckett when he says this list seems largely arbitrary.
    I think any such list would naturally be pretty arbitrary. How can one really
    tell how influential a face has been? The true influence of typefaces is probably
    subtle, subliminal, and perhaps subconscious.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also think this
    is an interesting question, and I'm curious: what is the purpose of compiling
    this list? (I'm not trying to be snarky; I'm really curious.) Are you an aspiring
    type designer who intends to examine the influential faces of the past to learn
    some good type design tips? Are you a graphic designer who intends to avoid using
    type that has previously been influential, in effort to break new ground?"

  body: "I think the biggest influences on type history have not been type faces at
    all. First, non-metal hardware, like typositor machines and Compugraphic photo
    typesetters, finally got us away from metal decisively and created new sources
    of supply staffed more by designers than skilled blue collar. Second, ITC seems
    to me to be the key influential foundry; it successfully repositioned type design
    as a truly happening medium open to all comers and goosed its competitors to fresher,
    more ambitious effort and stronger marketing. Type design became visible to the
    public. The big bang in type history occurred around 1970, with more instant classics
    appearing since than in the whole history of movable type until then--e.g., Sabon
    and Galliard, to start with. All this happened before Macs and Postscript, but
    PS was obviously the next big bang that allowed a new surge of creativity even
    more awesome. Now everybody could build their own type library at home. \r\n\r\nThe
    last influence of note was stylistic: I can't imagine how it happened, but oldstyle
    figures, largely ignored in photo-typesetting, kept gaining steadily until now
    they count as our key stylistic option globally--even the New York Times online
    uses Georgia, with oldstyle figures! Go figure! And thank God, OpenType finally
    makes accessing OSFs a snap; no more excuses like having to reach into the expert
    folder.\r\n\r\nWe should be careful ascribing influence to type faces because
    they are often a matter of fashion, coming and going in exactly that way. I remember
    when ITC Tiffany and Korinna were huge; now, who cares? \r\n\r\nWe still need
    revised industry standards in two areas: no more text families that lack bold
    and/or bold italic, and keystroke font links between roman and matching italic
    at a minimum. The cool boutique foundries are the worst perps here; the big boys
    never gave us these problems."

  body: "Just a historical clarification: ITC (International Typeface Corporation)
    wasn't technically a foundry, in the sense that they did not manufacture or distribute
    any type fonts themselves, at least not initially. It was formed to *license*
    designs to foundries and manufacturers, and to control the quality, consistency,
    and names of said designs. \r\n\r\nBut as John states, ITC represents a key paradigm
    shift in the history of typefaces by separating the activity of design from its
    dependence upon specific means of manufacture and machinery.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
