  would work in a magazine or even a newspaper setting. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nFor example, I like Breuer Text a lot but it is rather limited especially
  for display headlines.\r\n\r\nI also like Karbon but it seems like it might have
  too much character, especially for a newspaper. Not sure how extensive the family
  is.\r\n\r\nThanks again in advance."
