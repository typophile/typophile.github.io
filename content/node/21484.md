  basically designed a font in Illustrator CS2. I want to import it into Type Tool,
  but I can't copy and paste from the EPS file into TypeTool. When I try to use the
  \"import EPS\" option I get an error message.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nBest, Russ"

    you tried down saving the EPS to older formats i.e, not CS1/2 EPS?\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    target="_blank">that tutorial</a>? it explains in great depth the settings you
    need to set in illu in order to easily import the vector data into fontlab, which
    would maybe work for typetool, too.
