  I can't remember what typeface I used. It's terrible. I'm pretty sure it's an ITC
  font, but maybe it's Adobe... I don't know.\r\n\r\nI may have obliqued a little
  too, and I know I altered the Ti combo.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSean Glenn\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SavageTideLockup_4926.jpg]"

    (edit- for some reason this is shown here as Creative Alliance, but I have it
    in an old Adobe Catalog (and an Adobe font I bought), and I think it was designed
    by Phill Grimshaw. -- second edit: It was his friend Timothy Donaldson who designed
    it.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
