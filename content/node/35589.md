  it turns out to be tricky.\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator, it seems that the last Symbol
  always doesn't show. In TextEdit there is hardly any line spacing. Quark crashes...\r\n\r\nI've
  uploaded the resulting TrueType font and would be grateful if someone could have
  a look at this, maybe with FontForge and tell me what on earth I have to do differently.\r\n\r\nhttp://nullsieben.co.uk/ArtFund-Symbol-A1.ttf\r\n\r\nMaaaaaaaany
  thanks!"

  body: The glyph that occupies the "s" needs to have the contours merged. The contours
    are currently overlapping. Spacing alone should be able to handle the shapes of
    your symbols, so I'm not sure why there are kerning features and other kerning
    pairs added. Between the coffee cup and the wheelchair, there is a positive kern
    of 3075. It seems if you need a specific space between those two characters, you
    could put them together as a single glyph.

    by adding [edit: to your font]  a dumb character that is much higher than your
    icons.'

  body: "Your problems may also come from the options when you generate the font (but
    I would remove all kerning pairs anyway). For instance I just downloaded the [public
    domain]* icon font <a href=\"http://www.marvosym.de/download.html\">marvosym.ttf</a>
    (F\xFCr Puristen) and installed it on my mac. TextEdit would'nt even see the font.
    So I uninstaled it, opened marvosym.ttf with fontforge, clicked \"File > Generate
    fonts\", then clicked \"Options\" and unchecked \"Apple\", \"Opentype\" and \"Old
    style kern\" and then generated a new ttf font that I installed; everything seems
    to work nicely (always better to check the file with \"Font Book\" before installing,
    of course).\r\n\r\n[edit] * I meant Freeware; here is the copyright: <em>Martin

  body: "I just don't get it --- I thought creating a font was easier....\r\n\r\nStill
    the same problems:\r\n- the latest typed Character is not visible (a row of characters
    shows then, minus the last one)\r\n- when doing a return the text below diappears\r\n-
    Also, the typeface name in the Illustrator font menu is in brackets <Name>. I
    just cant work out why. Other symbol fonts don't have that.\r\n\r\nHere's a test
    file with more or less all the Fontforge defaults in place. I just imported the
    drawings and generated the font. I'll do letter spacing later. What would I have
    to do now to get it to work in the first place?\r\nhttp://nullsieben.co.uk/symbols2.sfd"

  body: </em>Here is a modified <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/symbols2.sfd">sfd
    file</a> and the resulting <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/Untitled2.ttf">Untitled2.ttf</a>
    file. The fact that the space character was undefined caused some problems and
    I just added it. The name of the font (independently of the filename) is, as you
    chose, "Untitled2" and when I select it in Word, Photoshop or Inkscape, I do not
    experience any of your problems. Maybe I should add that I am a LaTeX user and,
    for my very limited needs, fontforge has so far proven enough. This implies nothing
    for use in more sophisticated environments.

    tried the above Untitled2 font; I experienced absolutely none of your problems;
    everything works fine.
