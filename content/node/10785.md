  body: What do you mean by &#39;copyrighted a font&#39;? Are your referring to the
    design or to the software? In what jurisdiction? Are you specifically referring
    to copyright <i>registration</i> &#40;in most jurisdictions, copyright is automatatically
    applied to any new work that is protected under copyright legislation, so registration
    is optional&#41;?
