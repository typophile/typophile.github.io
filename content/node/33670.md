    times, but I'm sorry to say your site there is still slow, and now it has become
    'browser-hostile' to my antique Mac browsers. (My Mac OS X experiment was too
    much effort, for a variety of reasons, and will have to wait until I buy a new
    Mac later this year.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    We want to make it happen. It's just a matter of time. And by that time, the number
    of OS 9 and Windows ME users is even smaller.\r\n\r\nBut, hey, it looks like you
    got to the Sanuk page ok! Would love to know what issues you encounter. I assume
    you're using IE5 on OS 9?"

    I'm on OS X.

    but still feels slow compared to MyFonts. It also doesn't hold a custom sample
    while you look at various fonts.\r\n\r\nI use either iCab (a German-designed Mac
    browser) or  MS IE5. I can restart my computer in Mac OS X and use Mozilla, but

    render much more quickly by not forcing the entire page to reload. Any <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/rapier/&sample_text=Gamblin%20&sample_size=130\">custom
    sample</a> is still linkable. On any search result page, package page, or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/rapier/\">single

    or copy that underlined link."

    say, Scala Bold I don't want to have to guess whether it's in package 1, 2, whatever.\r\n\r\nTHe
    keyword search also needs some refining. For example I typed \"circus\" in both
    fontshop.com and myfonts.com. Fontshop gives me Helvetica, Bodoni, Snell Roundhand...
    huh? Myfonts gives me circus fonts (and fonts with circus in the name).\r\n\r\nThe
    sample feature is great, tho. And I like that you don't have to get the \"waterfall\"
    like in myfonts - that is a useless feature.\r\n\r\nI use Mac OS X (Tiger), Safari."

    improvements we made in the last revision. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Scala
    Bold\">Search for \"Scala Bold\"</a> and get packages that contain Scala Bold
    <em>and</em> single fonts. Try the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=scala%20bold\">same
    search on MyFonts</a>. I realize our new search engine isn't ideal in all cases,
    but it's far better than before. Each site's methodology has its merits.\r\n\r\n>
    The keyword search also needs some refining.\r\n\r\nI agree. It is sometimes far
    too loose right now and we'll improve it over time. The quality of results from
    any font reseller varies depending on the keyword."

    Mac, so I guess that works either way you interpret it.):\r\n\r\nWith OS 9 and
    iCab: -  I don't get the unsupported browser message at the top of the screen.
    I can go to the 'downloads' and 'singles' levels and generate custom samples,
    but the url info never changes to show the \"&sample_text=\" part, and I don't
    see any \"Link to this custom text\" choice. \r\n\r\nWith OS 9 and IE5: - I get
    the unsupported browser message at the top. I can get the Package showing (downloads)
