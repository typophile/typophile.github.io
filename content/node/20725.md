body: I am looking for typesetters who are proficient with FrameMaker for a very IMMEDIATE
  project here in southern CA. It's freelance work -- starting literally TODAY and
  going for about 7-10 days or so. Schedule can be worked out, but we need immediate
  typesetting to get a deadline met. Can you help on this? Do you know someone who
  can? Call me at (323) 595-6242 or (323) 462-2140. Thanks. Best, Lindsay Morfopoulos

  body: "Hey Lindsay_M. Maybe you could provide a lot more details about the project
    and some of the friendly people here might know of someone to help you out. \r\n\r\nWould
    people have to go to SoCal or could you discuss with them over the phone and send
    them the files they need via email or download?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of work are you
    looking for? What kind of books/typsetting do you need done? Do you only need
    1 typesetter, or are their multiple books/projects you need worked on?\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your budget for this project? "

    body: "Thanks and no problem. I'll give you all the details I can and hopefully
      someone someone can help!\r\n\r\nYes, the project has to be done in-house in
      SoCal. We have pretty great facilities and literally just lack the manpower.
      It's several books, and we're looking for several typesetters. \r\n\r\nThe main
      issue we've got is that the work must be done FAST. I'd literally like to get
      some typesetters to work TODAY and this would go for the next 7-10 days or so.
      \r\n\r\nBoth schedule and budget questions are really for my boss. But if someone
      gives me a call (323) 595-6842 or (323) 462-2140, I'll give you contact info
      for him and he can REALLY answer any and all questions."
