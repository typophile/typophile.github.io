  a hideous bastardization of Galliard, but does it actually exist as a retail type,

  body: Uau, the lowercase 'd' is simply atrocious. The same goes for the 'p'.

  body: That's because the stress was reversed as the characters were flipped, not
    rotated. What an abomination!

  body: "It's pretty obvious to me that this is a hacked up version of Galliard. Talk
    about cutting strokes.\r\n\r\nEdit--Oops, I didn't read Nick's initial post very
    closely in which he already identified this as a version of Galliard."

  body: the lowercase d and p are too funny. i'm not even that typographically conservative,
    but that's just so bad!
