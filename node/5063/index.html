  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and respected type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements regarding Berthold in a public forum. <BR> <BR>As such statements affect the reputation of Berthold Types, I am responding with this posting. I attach a letter dated June 3, 2004, to Mr. Spiekermann explaining the actual facts behind the continuation of H. Berthold's type business by Berthold Types. This letter is from Berthold Types Limited's German attorneys because the subject matter involves German law. We arranged for the attached English translation. <BR> <BR>Although the letter to Mr. Spiekermann addresses the myths and misconceptions perpetuated by Mr. Spiekermann's comments, I would like to make a few points: <BR> <BR>1. Berthold Designers <BR>Mr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original Berthold designers even though he is well aware of the agreement with Guenter Gerhard Lange.  Mr. Spiekermann, a friend of Mr. Lange, tried to persuade Mr. Lange against working with Berthold Types but failed. <BR> <BR>Contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statement, Berthold Types has agreements with Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd Moellenstaedt, Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan Nordling and Prof. Werner Schneider.  <BR> <BR>&ndash;Mr. Lange (at 83) is working on new typefaces for Berthold Types; having completed Whittingham in 2001 and additions to his other typefaces (Bodoni Old Face and Imago). He also has a new typeface yet to be released and has embarked on another large typeface project for Berthold Types. Mr. Lange as artistic consultant is actively involved in future type releases by Berthold. <BR> <BR>&ndash;Mr. Moellenstaedt has created a new, large typeface family for Berthold Types (yet to be released) as well as preparing additional offerings of Formata. <BR> <BR>&ndash;Prof. Schneider recently completed and Berthold Types released his Senatus typeface. <BR> <BR>&ndash;Mr. Hofrichter works on many projects for Berthold's type program and works closely with Berthold Types to insure the continued quality of the Berthold type program. He works directly with GGL on all his new releases. <BR> <BR>All of the contracts between H. Berthold AG and the designers specifically stated that when a typeface design falls into the public domain the obligation by Berthold to pay royalities ceases. Berthold Types offered to pay designers nonetheless. Notwithstanding, Hans Reichel chose to release a reworking of Barmeno. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, according to H. Berthold's royalty worksheet, Mr. Spiekermann was never paid royalties on an ongoing basis for Berliner Grotesk and LoType.  <BR> <BR>2. Registration of Berthold's Trademarks <BR>Mr. Spiekermann also implies that any company could simply register H. Berthold's trademarks. This is simply not true. <BR> <BR>The Type division of H. Berthold was a separated in October 1991 and the Type assets were &quot;leased&quot; back to H. Berthold by a consortium of banks. The Type division was not a part of the H. Berthold AG bankruptcy in 1993 and was separate from Berthold's other businesses. Berthold Types acquired the type assests (e.g. the trademarks as well as other IP rights &ndash; see the attached letter) through the chain of title through these banks, not through bankruptcy. <BR> <BR>Accordingly, contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statements, over 80 German trademark registrations, and numerous UK and US registrations, were assigned through the &quot;chain of title&quot; from H. Berthold AG to Berthold Types, including the &quot;Berthold in a red square logo&quot; and the &quot;H. Berthold&quot; trademarks.  <BR> <BR>3. Protection of Berthold's IP Rights <BR>Mr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has been &quot;suing dozens of people with frivolous cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and I am not exaggerating).&quot; <BR> <BR>It's a myth. In fact, Berthold Types has filed only twelve lawsuits two of which were against FSI/FontShop (both for trademark infringement). Mr. Spiekermann cannot provide any basis supporting losses of &quot;millions of dollars.&quot; Type is just not that large of a business.  <BR> <BR> <BR>If Mr. Spiekermann wants to debate: Stick to the facts, please. <BR> <BR>Respectfully, <BR> <BR>Harvey Hunt <BR>President <BR>Berthold Types Limited <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Spiekermann_Translation-37443.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*91.9*Translation*Spiekermann_Translation%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Translation<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/Spiekermann_Translation-37443.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Spiekermann_Translation.pdf</b></a> (91.9 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for telling us your side of the story. <BR> <BR>Two questions, if I may: <BR> <BR>1) You cited 5 designers with whom you have a valid business relationship. How many designers total are represented in your library? How would you describe the relationship with them? <BR> <BR>2) &quot;Berthold Types has filed only twelve lawsuits&quot;. May we please know how many &quot;cease and desist&quot; and other what might be informally called &quot;pre-lawsuit&quot; letters you have sent out? I think this is significant because -as anybody knows- a confrontational letter (especially when directed to individuals with modest or non-existent legal resources) can have nearly the same effect as a lawsuit. <BR> <BR>I ask these question only in the interest of full disclusure (some of us simply enjoy knowing), not as a potential basis for persecution. I don't have a lawyer, btw. But I am from Beirut. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. Hunt, <BR> <BR>As a graphic designer, I appreciate the Berthold type library, particularly Akzidenz Grotesk, which may come at no surprise as I'm sure its very popular. In fact, I'd be inclined to say that if stranded on a desert island with one font and a newletter to publish, AG would be a top choice. <BR> <BR>However, when our studio is looking to purchase new fonts, I'm less inclined to purchase from Berthold when I have heard so many rumblings of lawsuits and cease-and-desist letters to other, arguably smaller, type foundries over similar-sounding font naming taxonomies.  <BR> <BR>When I attended TypeCon last year, I was heartened to get my first taste of the cameraderie of the type design industry, not to mention observing over the last few years the friendliness of font industry designers and reps in their interactions here at Typophile, many of which are small business owners working very hard to stay afloat and perfect their craft in a tough industry. <BR> <BR>Many foundries and retailers were represented at TypeCon; I don't recall any Berthold presence, other than careful mentions in hushed conversations. Come to think of it, I rarely hear of anything other than legal action and scare tactics. Surely you must understand that while these actions intend to protect your assets from infringement, the perceptions of the end customer suffer. How would you respond to this? As one of the established names/brands in the industry, what is Berthold doing to preserve the craft and build the community?  <BR> <BR>Sincerely,  <BR> <BR>B. Gibbs</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am happy to see that the president of Berthold has posted on this forum. Although, I must agree with Mr. Spiekermann and the others here: posting a response on this forum would have been a more polite first step than having an attorney draft a letter and send it to him first. <BR> <BR>I think that the public exchange of opinion over the internet is one it's biggest perks. While it is obvious that Mr. Spiekermann's opinion of Berthold is not a positive one, I do not think that his statements were libelous or defamatory. (He is certainly entitled to his opinion, and he is also entitled to propogate it politely) Also, we are only looking at <i>a few short posts on an online forum.</i> I think, if someone with Mr. Spiekerman's gravitas in the type community wanted to go to war with Berthold, he easily could. And he wouldn't need do it via banter on an online forum. Berthold is certainly aware of this. I don't understand their ultra-protectionary, overtly legal-feeling reaction. <BR> <BR>B.Gibbs has an interesting point, too. Monotype, Linotype, FontShop, E+F, and many other founderies all have presences at large type events and activities. Their designers all lecture, too. Is Berthold not doing this because it can't afford the costs? At TYPO Berlin, the Managing Director of Linotype, talking about piracy protection, said that the best way to prevent piracy is through technological and design innovation. <BR> <BR>He didn't say that the best method was sending out cease-and-desist letters.  <BR> <BR>I wonder what the impression of Berthold on this forum would be if it had spent the money required for its 12 lawsuits, or even the legal and translation fees necessary for the letter to Mr. Spiekermann, on <i>product marketing</i> instead?  <BR> <BR>(However, Mr. Spiekermann, it is well-known that Linotype and many other foundries do file law suits to protect their work from piracy. I am assuming that FontShop does this as well. Can you tell me if cease-and-desist letters are common in our industry? Berthold may or may not have sent out <i>too many</i>, but how many are sent out by their competitors?) <BR> <BR>hallo Titus! sch</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The point of this thread is to discuss publically the difference between intelectual property rights of the designer, copyright infringement, and bullyism.  This thread is not a forum to discuss Hrant or his already well documented political feelings. Propaganda extremists of all persuasions often use a cheap trick  to diffuse criticism and point blame at some convenient scapegoat.  Their point is to swing the conversation to something else to divert attention and replace it with an attack on either the original source or to dump on anyone close enough.  Willie Horton was used this way in the Dukakis campaign. The Jews in the 30s were used this way to take the heat away from the new Nazi government. <BR>The ploy always involves a nameless heckler to act as a distraction and keep everyone from going back to the real issue. <BR> <BR>How about if we just ignore the heckler(s) and confine discussion to the original intent of this thread and not respond at all to the heckler? <BR>(I'll bet that I am the next victim, within seconds of my posting this) <BR>Like an insect bite, IGNORE THE ITCH, SCRATCHING IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In my opinion, this issue has nothing to do with the Nazis, Jews, or the second World War. These are not only off topic additions/comments, they could also poison discussion to the extent that Berthold and/or Mr. Spiekermann would no longer respond to the points discussed above. <BR> <BR>I would really, really, like to hear from Mr. Hunt, and hear his opinion about Berthold's opinion in the design community. Perhaps he thinks that we are a bunch of nuts, and taht our opinions are not representative. Perhaps he even has sales figures to back that up! <i>I don't know.</i> But I would really like to know&hellip; <BR> <BR>I would also like to hear how many lawsuits FontShop has filed, or something similiar, to use as a point of comparison. If FSI has filed 24 lawsuits in the same time period that Berthold filed 12, that says something. If they filed 2, that says something else. <BR> <BR>Hrant, we all know your opinions about the US Government, and its legal system. In some respects, you are right, especially when it comes to Type and its protection. EU courts offer type designs and foundries much more protection, I think. <BR> <BR>However, bashing the US court system, is not so relevant to this topic, I think. Many of the lawsuits in discussion were filed in European courts, so the US and its benefits/fallacies, play little effect. <BR> <BR>Also, I think that &quot;Trademarking&quot; something is more of an international process now than a national one. <BR> <BR>Again, lets talk about Berthold. Perhaps they really are the demon of the type world. Perhaps we are mistaken in our opinion. I don't think that we will learn anything about these questions from discussing the ideals of democracy, or the prelude to the Holocaust. <BR> <BR>(As I side note, I'll bite that I am very interested in talking about democracy in general, the US court system in particular, or even the treatment of Jews by the Nazi government from 1933 to 1945! But I'd rather do it in another thread, preferably one under <b>General Discussion</b>.</div>

I remember one instance where we asked another foundry to change the name of their product as it was identical (not similar, IDENTICAL); we did so politely without threats (real or implied) though with the help of a lawyer. If there were more instances, I cannot remember but they would have been handled the same way.

Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the  <BR>&gt;original designers whose fonts are being sold today;  <BR>&gt;thus effectively stealing from designers&hellip; <BR> <BR>While Hunt says: <BR>&gt;Contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statement, Berthold Types  <BR>&gt;has agreements with Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd  <BR>&gt;Moellenstaedt, Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan Nordling and  <BR>&gt;Prof. Werner Schneider.  <BR> <BR>Well straight away it should be clear that these five individuals are not those representing all the designs in the Berthold catalogue. <BR> <BR>Additionally it seems that Hunt is talking about &quot;new&quot; or reworked designs, where Spiekermann is talking about the &quot;original&quot; designs. <BR> <BR>I think it's unlikely that Spiekermann is privvy to the day to day running of Berthold, so it's equally unlikely that he knows exactly who is doing what for them - so missing some detail here cannot be contsrued as lying (you can only lie if you falsely state something that you actually know). <BR> <BR>The worst that you can say is that Spiekermann exaggerated - but even then he would need to know every fact, and it's not clear that anyone outside Bethold does, or even that Berthold itself does (being the &quot;final&quot; recipient in a long line of bankruptcies). <BR> <BR>As posted by &quot;Hans Mustermann&quot; there's a great chunk of the Berthold library for which no designer receives a royalty.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Perhaps that is why Erik Spiekermann will not respond in this forum. &lt; <BR> <BR>No, it is not. It is much simpler. but going into it may cost me a lot of money in lawyers' fees again. The officers of FontShop International are restrained from discussing certain legal issues. This goes back to a certain foundry in Illinois selling fonts but keeping the money due to some small legal clause in the contract. The licensor in Berlin had to pay the original designers, of course, plus lots and lots of lawyers' fees. This is where me mentioning seven digits came from. While i am not an officer of FSI. but simply a shareholder, that said outfit by the lake is very trigger-happy and even has a family member who belongs to the legal profession, making it easy to issue writs and all manner of legal proceedings which usually require at least a reply by another lawyer, in English. And that costs money, lots. Most of the suits are frivolous: there is a typeface called Signata. There is another face called Signa, the 2 look not a bit alike, but a letter was written asking to change that name as it would infringe upon the rights of that foundry by the lake. Which itself has another font named Signal which apparently cannot be confused with Signata, while Signa can. <BR> <BR>FSI has pursued pirates, people who simply copy FontFonts and offer them under a different name. If someone offered a font named Unite, i wouldn't give a damn, as long as it wasn't a copy of my own FF Unit. The people who couldn't tell one from the other would never spend money on a font anyway. <BR> <BR>And about the designers who now work for a certain&hellip;: <BR> <BR>They're all people in Munich who used to work for B and seem to have no choice in order to protect their investment. And some are simply blind to what's going on because they don't want to see 50 years of their lives going down the drain.  <BR> <BR>And why would a certain gentleman not appear at typo events? Because he cheated and still cheats designers out of their money, and they all know it and let him know that they know.  <BR> <BR>And i do know what goes on at B in C, as i do know what has been going on at B in B since the mid-60s. I designed most of their literature, reworked the logo and the corporate design in the 80s, made my first typefaces for them, wrote a book for them and was friends with their designers, managers and technicians here in Berlin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear friends, <BR> <BR>My sad story is published on <a href="http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm">http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm</a></a> <BR> <BR>I'm not intended to discuss this topic more. <BR>Last Fall I have sent a letter to Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="http://eff.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://eff.org/">http://eff.org/</a></a>) <BR>This letter is all I want to publish on given respected forum. <BR>One my Italian friend wrote me:  <BR>&quot;Unfortunately the law is on Berthold's side, but what we need is not a lawyer, actually, we need a popular insurrection in the community of designers, it's time to stop this kind of &quot;terrorism&quot;. <BR>I think this is the only thing to do. Maybe it will not work, but at least it will put our colleagues in a position where they will need to choose, make a decision: to go with or against Berthold.&quot; <BR>I think we have not to serve for laws and courts, but the judgement's goal is to serve for people, for community. <BR>Thank You all. <BR> <BR>So, <BR> <BR> <BR>Dear Sirs, <BR> <BR>My name is Igor Shipovsky. I'm a national of Russia. <BR> <BR>A year ago I started selling my products (digital typefaces) with the MyFonts.com, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). In August, 2003 I received a complaint from another American company - Berthold Types Limited (Chicago, Illinois). Ms Melissa M. Hunt alleged that the names of my web-site and my fonts do infringe their registered trademark CITY. <BR>My web-site is named 'fontcity.ru'. My fonts are named after Russian cities: 'City of Moskva' (Moskva is Moscow in Russian), 'City of Khabarovsk', 'City of Tsaritsyn', etc. <BR>Ms Hunt alleged that Berthold has registered the TM &quot;CITY&quot; and that my fonts names are a 'colorable imitation' of this TM. <BR> <BR>I strongly oppose this position: <BR>- I suppose the word &quot;city&quot; is a generic term and is not a particularly strong TM. Moreover, I am a national of Russia and Berthold has no registered TM in Russia. <BR>- My fonts are performed in an original graphical manner and the whole line of typefaces has its own unique style. There cannot be any confusion between my fonts and the ones of Berthold company. <BR>- Moreover, I use the word &quot;city&quot; in its original lexical meaning, in an illustrative and descriptive way only. This word is a part of a single whole concept I create to present my products. I have created my own unique style including typefaces (the character shapes), their names, description texts, music, animation, pictures, color palette and so on. I invented the new word 'FONTCITY' for naming my web-site. <BR>- I understand, that the names 'Moskva', 'Khabarovsk', 'Tsaritsyn' and so on mean nothing to the most of people, not only Americans, but Russians too. I can't delete or substitute the word &quot;city&quot; without distortion of the names' sense. <BR>- I can't name my fonts in Russian because there are certain rules requiring to use the numbers and English letters only for this purpose. <BR> <BR>As I know, many companies and persons were urged to change the names of their fonts by Berthold. All of them do not accept the accusations but to avoid possible costs of litigation had to follow instructions from Berthold. <BR>Here are the links to their stories: <BR><a href="http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html">http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html</a></a> - the victims list <BR><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html</a></a> - Berthold vs Jamie Nazaroff <BR><a href="http://typographi.ca/000500.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://typographi.ca/000500.php">http://typographi.ca/000500.php</a></a> - Zang-o-fonts: &quot;The Schoolyard Bullies Never Go Away&quot; <BR><a href="http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/bertholdvsnick.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/bertholdvsnick.html">http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/bertholdvsnick.html</a></a> - Berthold vs Nick Curtis <BR><a href="http://typographi.ca/000682.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://typographi.ca/000682.php">http://typographi.ca/000682.php</a></a> - Berthold vs Cape-Arcona (typographi.ca's forum) <BR><a href="http://typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16157.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16157.html">http://typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16157.html</a></a> - typophile.com's forum <BR><a href="http://www.internet-law.ru/forum/index.php?board=10" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.internet-law.ru/forum/index.php?board=10">http://www.internet-law.ru/forum/index.php?board=10</a></a>;action=display;threadid=196;start=0 - internet-law.ru's forum <BR> <BR>Recently my American partner, the MyFonts.com, Inc. decided to suspend selling my fonts. <BR>I believe Berthold's actions constitute unfair competition and abuse of intellectual property rights.

		<div class="commentbody">Here Mr. Phinney represents his employer and therefore cannot speak as freely for himself as the rest of us because that might be construed as coming from Adobe. I don't blame him for that and I appreciate truth coming from anyone and everyone since I have no way of knowing who the honest ones are.  I don't know about the Adobe &quot;compatability lists&quot; and have never heard of them prior to today.   <BR>There does seem to be a great deal of at least sentiment, if not evidence, that the once proud name of Berthold has now fallen to the level of vicious predator.  It would seem that Berthold should be forthcoming and lay ALL of the truth on the table very soon if it wants to have any chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the community which not only buys but specs and recomends type faces to the world. Typographers, type designers, art directors, graphic designers, and publishers are the gatekeepers of type purchase.  If many of them boycott any single foundry, it can have a large impact on their profits.  We have many alternative suppliers to choose from and are within our rights for any reason to use and recomend (or not recomend) any typeface or vendor.  Berthold may have legal means of preventing others from naming fonts to their liking and not paying designers for their work but there is no law that says we MUST use their products if we choose not to.  No company can survive abusing their own clients.  <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

The average computer user only uses the fonts that come bundled free with other software or operating system.  The concept of buying type is pretty much tied to the design and publishing industry.  Corporations use what their design/branding consultants recomend. If you look at advertising by type houses, you can see it is tailored to the same crowd.  Ads are placed in the design trade mags with lots of sponsorship of organization events like AIGA or TDC.  You don't see type ads placed with broad market strategies in Newsweek or Fortune.  Adobe most likely places ads for their products with broader market appeal, like Acrobat, in many more venues than its type collection.  Type houses are smart buniness men/women for the most part.  They know who the gatekeepers are and would not waste money placing ads in unproductive markets.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, this is exactly my point. I don't think that Berthold actually does advertise. And (Thomas/Simon?) I don't think that they license their fonts for font bundling anymore, either. <BR> <BR>To me, this seems like two unwise business decisions. <BR> <BR>I think that Berthold's sales probably come through AG, and <b>its</b> fame and reputation. All of the trouble recently on Typophile came about because some posters recommended not buying AG from <b>Berthold</b>. This must have been seen as threat enough by Mr. Hunt; in any event it seemed to have ruffled his feathers enough to pay his lawyer and translator to write a stupid letter to Erik Spiekermann. We all know how much lawywers charge by the hour. <BR> <BR>Well, what if we just <b>didn't</b> buy AG from Berthold anymore. It isn't like the world isn't full enough with similar and/or better typefaces anyway&hellip; we could just recommend to all of our clients that they should use (insert your favorite Helvetica/Grotesk style here) instead, because, quite frankly, they should not give their money to a man like Mr. Hunt. <BR> <BR>Most media buyers/clients won't care one way or another, I suspect. But designers can make a (small) difference. This would, in the grand scheme of things, be a small difference, but it would improve our little sector of the market.</div>

(Poppl-Laudatio, Poppl-Laudatio Condensed, Berthold Bodoni Old Face, still my favorite Bodoni.) The Berthold Library is one of the finest in the world. I wish I could in good conscience buy more. I've wanted to buy Post-Mediaeval for years now. <BR> <BR>I prefer to hear from people like Prof. Spiekermann, Boton, Jaeger et al, who have been dealing with this aftermath for the past several years and have some personal stake in this. <b>Very</b> personal.

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstreams clones are not illegal! In the 1980s, Bitstream licensed the entire Linotype library for sale. However, their agreement with Linotype only allowed them to sell the designs, not the names themselves. So, Bitstream had to come up with its own naming system. Swiss and Helvetica were therefore the same design, just with different names. This was not illegal or immoral at all. Linotype, and its designers, got paid. Since then, Bitstream has gotten a different license, which also allows them to name the Linotype fonts correctly. (I think that this is all true) <BR> <BR>Hrant could perhaps make legal Poppl revivals. As most of us know, only Typeface names (and their digital outlines) are trademarkable, except in Germany. In Germany, the DESIGN of a font is also protected by a patent, as long as that patent has been officially registered in Germany. These design patents expire after 25 year, and can never be renewed. The names and the outlines can be renewed, though. <BR> <BR>So, if Hrant makes new drawings based off of a Poppl design that is over 25 years old, doesn't reference Berthold's actual files, and names it something totally different, he could legally sell that font as a revival. He could also patent the font and its design in Germany, and have the legal protection of thh German courts behind him when Berthold eventually would sue. <BR> <BR>But that would be a suit that Berthold would lose, in any court, anywhere. That would be a fun day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems all of my Poppl fonts were TOC but here is an example of floppies.  The top 2 (Imago &amp; Formata) are Berthold fonts under the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; label but in the Adobe collection.  The Walbaum does not have the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; designation, only Adobe (it may be that it is just older).  I include the Adobe Caslon as an example of typical Adobe labeling as a comparison. I also have Baskerville, AG, and BE Garamond on TOC but have purchased nothing else of Berthold since.

		<div class="commentbody">Your history is selective, and in places revisionist. And this isn't about companies stealing fonts from each other, it's about corporations intimidating individuals. You're just using Bitstream as an excuse to justify [other] bad behavior, to distract*. And speaking of &quot;relative ethics&quot;, when William Garth of Compugraphic was asked how the newly formed company would build a font library, he replied &quot;in the usual manner&quot;**, which basically meant swiping - but the point is that so many companies did that (including ATF, <i>Enschede</i>, and so many more), people -unfortunately- mind it less. What people are complaining about in this thread is <i>bullying</i>, and to many of us that's a greater violation of the social fabric. Focus, please. <BR> <BR>* And/or maybe vent (see below). <BR> <BR>** See the Romano article in issue #46 of APHA. <BR> <BR>Again, to re-focus: <BR>&gt; I haven't seen anyone claim they broke any laws. <BR> <BR>What you have to get is that this is not about legality, but ethics. Sometimes you seem to get that important distinction, but when it's convenient you squirm around it. Which of course is typical of anonymous participants, since they have nothing to loose. On the other hand, as long as somebody like me is around, they still won't get away with the spin, so the best way to describe your participation here is &quot;venting&quot;. But don't worry, you're not alone. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Most of the complaints above have nothing to do with stealing anything, except of course if you count human dignity. <BR> <BR>That said, in fact I do make a huge distinction between stealing from individuals versus companies. One of the worst things about capitalism is that it treats companies as entities deserving more respect than individuals. <BR> <BR>&gt; they are all going to do their best to protect their work from others <BR> <BR>Bull. Decent people draw the line this side of decency, the rest don't. Which isn't to say that line is set in stone, not at all.

What they did was a (sad) norm of sorts. This is not. Furthermore, in the past few years Bitstream has done more good things (like recanting on their disregard of embedding permissions) than most anybody else. While this is an <i>ongoing</i> issue, not a historical one. <BR> <BR>It seems you have a pet vendetta against Bitstream (which makes you smell just like another chronic anonyrat Typophile experiences now and again), in which case I'd suggest using a separate thread for venting. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From a practical perspective, it makes sense for the small business to avoid litigation. <BR> <BR>So the best strategy for a foundry is to give its fonts made-up names, or really obscure names (eg Mrs Eaves &ndash; although that is kinda like Mr Stinky). I'm surprised we don't see more typefaces with Autechre/AphexTwin music-title kind of names. <BR> <BR>One doesn't have to be bullied to be intimidated. To my mind, Apple and Adobe's font bundling practice is no different than what the EU recently fined Microsoft for, and an absolutely massive suppression of the market for fonts, both prosumer and professional. But it's unlikely that any government is going to go after a company for dumping fonts. I mean, it's only fonts, duh. And I'm certainly not going to sue them!  <BR> <BR>As for Bitstream's marketing clout, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  <BR>I know from personal experience that big CD collections of legacy and back catalogue fonts reduce the need for companies to buy fresh fonts. Many times I've had art directors say &quot;Sorry Nick, I recommended your typeface, used it in a comp, even, but they have the Adobe/Bitstream collection, and want to use something similar from that&quot;. <BR> <BR>So I'm 100% behind Bitstream's initiative of including a &quot;sampler&quot; of fonts from a variety of independent foundries, as part of the Type Odyssey CD, and glad to be represented.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstream is certainly worthy of discussion - but in a thread of it's own. This thread is generally about Berthold Types tactics that some have serious issues with. If it's kept on task and civil, then we can reasonably continue to expect input from all sides from the Hunt's to the Boton's and the Spiekerman's. When the discussion is kept civil, I strongly believe that a broader scope of participants will engage. And that will make a thread like this much more educational as opposed to polarizing. <BR> <BR>It's tricky to keep it on the subject for sure, but vitally important for the value of a reasonably objective overview of the full story. <BR> <BR>As one example, I for one would still like to know (from either the Hunt's or a first-hand source) if Gertrude Poppl made an agreement for the Poppl types that Berthold now distributes - including Nero. <BR> <BR>As another example, I would like to know why the Hunt's registered the trademark for the name &quot;Renner&quot; having to do with typefaces (and subsequently let the trademark lapse a few years later).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bouncer, I find it strange that you are so quick to forgive Berthold, yet you will demonize Bitsttream at the same time. Bitstream, and its licensing stories have been discussed many times on this forum. Even if they are guilty of piracy in the past, which I don't believe, they are certainly clean now. <BR> <BR>Berthold, which was once very clean, is now very dirty, as exemplified by the first thread in this discussion. <BR> <BR>At least I have the decency to post under my real name when I make controversial statements such as the ones above. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I would like to know the answers to your two questions, too. However, you know that Mr. Hunt won't answer them. Especially question number two&hellip; no foundry is going to tell you the exact number of cease and desist letters taht they have sent out. <BR> <BR>And Bouncer, this doesn't justify Berthold's actions one bit. If FSI, Linotype, Bitsream, et al. sent out as many questionable letters as Berthold had, we'd all know about it. Those storeis would show up here, too, and they haven't. <BR> <BR>Lastly, Hrant, I know that you are afraid of American lawyers, but they aren't all bad. In the example I used before, about legit revivals, the ficticious designer in question would have nothing to fear. Some lawyers do go over the top in litigation, but sometimes the law is chrystal clear. In the case of type, there are so few laws that it would be asy to rest assured knowing that a certain party would be right in a certain case.</div>

What I wrote was that if you want to criticise them do so for stealing the designs of others - don't do so for sending out cease and desist letters. <BR> <BR>And if you're going to do it then take into account what others do - ie Bitstream and Agfa&hellip; <BR> <BR>If you go back to the comments that started this thread you'll see that even Erik Spiekermann - who has more to complain about than most others here - said that Berthold are entitled to protect their trademarks. <BR> <BR>&gt;2) That the real intention of your posts are to bring  <BR>&gt;closure and/or abandonment to an issue that you do not  <BR>&gt;want to see discussed further (especially by Hrant). <BR> <BR>Not at all, I just see no logic in demanding answers when it is reasonably clear that you won't get them. Additionally it's still not altogether clear to me *what* this thread is about. <BR> <BR>It starts with Hunt responding to Spiekermann's allegations - someone (smart person) calls Spiekermann a liar (good move I think!). Some points are clarified, many are not. Read between the lines and you have the answers: <BR> <BR>Berthold pays some of its &quot;designers&quot; - these are people who are engaged in revivals of their own work or extensions of the same. Berthold has no choice but to pay them because they wouldn't do the &quot;new&quot; work otherwise. <BR> <BR>Therefore it is obvious that those that are not named are not getting paid - because the &quot;spin control&quot; would seek to neutralise all the criticism that it can. It can't, QED. <BR> <BR>&gt;Bouncer, I find it strange that you are so quick to forgive  <BR>&gt;Berthold, yet you will demonize Bitsttream <BR> <BR>I never forgave Berthold, nowhere in this thread. And what Bitstream did in terms of design theft was much worse than Berthold. It's easy. <BR> <BR>&gt;Even if they are guilty of piracy in the past, which  <BR>&gt;I don't believe, they are certainly clean now. <BR> <BR>What do you mean you don't believe!? Bitstream stole all of Linotype's designs, renamed them and sold them for years and years - there was no deal with Linotype that allowed them to do this. <BR> <BR>Please, show us some evidence to back up your claim? <BR> <BR>The reason all the names were changed was because otherwise it would infringe the trademark, the only protection available to Linotype in the USA. IE Bitstream relied on the law rather than ethics. <BR> <BR>I believe you are confusing this issue with that of URW - which is similar, but quite different. <BR> <BR>&gt;At least I have the decency to post under my real name  <BR>&gt;when I make controversial statements such as the ones above. <BR> <BR>Great, you can use your &quot;real name&quot; to perpetuate lies, and I can't use a nick to tell the truth. Justice! <BR> <BR>&gt;Those storeis would show up here, too, and they haven't.  <BR> <BR>Yes, because this is the font of all knowledge.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Back to the intital issue (i only read these posting once a week). <BR> <BR>1. The case between FSI and HH ended in a compromise after so much money was spent that FSI couldn't go on. Which is the purpose of starting all these suits in Illinois. And Mrs H being a lawyer sure helps keep the expenses down for them. Mr H says that designers were paid as the result of the compromise. They were, but only by FSI. H kept all the money he had taken for the sales of FontFonts when the franchise agreement was terminated because of some technical clause particular to Illinois law. I never understood how a court could make a contract void but let  one of the 2 parties keep the proceeds from a void deal. But then i am not a lawyer and operate under the simple premise that designers should get paid by whoever gets proceeds from selling their fonts. I am expecting another letter from Chicago because i wasn't supposed to discuss this in public, ever. But i can let H know already that i'll ignore whatever comes from him. He'll have to send the sheriffs over to get anything out of me. Or the Marine Corps. <BR> <BR>2. If Getraude Popple (Friedrich Poppl's widow) spoke english, i'd get her to write her version of the dealings with H. She never signed a contract because she couldn't agree with the conditions. So Poppl's fonts are sold without a contract, illegally. She hasn't got the means to pursue the matter, and H knows this. <BR> <BR>There are lots of other stories to be told about H's behaviour and attitude towards our business. The one thing i can mention is the news that got all this started: if someone tries to prevent another foundry from using the word &quot;Grotesk&quot; or &quot;Grotesque&quot; in a typeface name, that person is not out to protect a tradename, but to harrass the competition. If he hadn't lost that one, the next step could have been sueing anybody who used Sans or Serif or Antiqua, as all these are part of some Berthold trademark or other. <BR> <BR>3. Just the fact that no typedesigner outside a small bunch of people who used to work for Berthold will work for them should be enough to tell the rest of the community (or call it business) what their practices are. They all know more than can be told here. <BR> <BR>4. A lof of people think that B in Chicago is not a legal successor. H writes: <BR> <BR>&gt;The acquisition of the designs and trademarks was recognized by the German Patent and Trademark Office as well as by WIPO, which authorities recorded the assignments. In that regard, Berthold Types Limited acquired the Type Assets and thereby is also the legal successor to H. Berthold AG. &lt; <BR> <BR>This is a very clever way of making something sound logical and obvious, but it isn't. A new company having acquired the assets of an old company doesn't make the new company the legal successor, it just makes it the owner of the assets. If they honoured the old contracts, one might be more inclined to believe that argument. But when it comes to paying old dues and debts, the new company conveniently seems to have no connections with its predecessor. <BR> <BR>Intimidation and bullying is their game, as simple as that. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Erik <BR> <BR>As you choose to discuss confidential material in a public forum and then state that you will ignore private correspondence, I shall make my response in the same forum.  <BR> <BR>FONTSHOP USA <BR>As you recall there was a business dispute between FontShop USA (a Fontshop distribution company owned by me) and FSI Fonts und Software GmbH. This dispute was resolved in the form of a Settlement Agreement that FSI insisted be confidential. <BR> <BR>It appears that FSI's intention was to keep the truth confidential while FSI embarked on a crusade claiming that I cheated designers out of their money. Nothing could be farther from the truth. <BR> <BR>Here are the facts: <BR> <BR>1. FontShop USA agreed to pay (and PAID) the designers' portion of the sales of FontFonts. The dispute was with FSI and never the FontFont designers.  <BR> <BR>2. FSI audited and declared valid every single sale of a FontFont typeface (Petra Weitz coordinated this). <BR> <BR>3. FontShop USA paid FSI close to six figures (US$) representing the designers' portion of the sales of FontFonts. The dispute did not involve millions of dollars and FSI certainly did not pay the FontFont designers out of its own pocket as claimed by Erik. <BR> <BR>4. FSI also got the &quot;fontshop.com&quot; domain and Joan got to open her own FontShop in the U.S. <BR> <BR>5. FontShop USA was represented by a law firm, not my wife. <BR> <BR>So it appears that for the past eight years, Erik, you have been lying that I kept all of the money from the sales of FontFonts.  <BR> <BR>Erik of course has every right to choose who he likes and dislikes. But he does not have a right to lie in an effort to disparage my reputation and that of my companies. <BR> <BR>It occurs to me that this is all about a personal problem that Erik has with me regarding a third person. It is not appropriate to discuss this in an open forum because it could be embarassing to her.  <BR> <BR>What happened, happened. Get over it. I would have thought by this time Erik that you would have moved on in your life rather than dwell on the past. If only for the other person. <BR> <BR> <BR>Harvey Hunt</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My final post to this thread (in case anybody is still interested in the *real* topic): <BR> <BR>There are obviously different ways of presenting the truth. While i know that there is more to this than Mr Hunt states, i cannot present any real figures and facts without entering a very libelous area. Suffice to say that dealing with someone who sees people in this business not as partners but as potential enemies has cost other parties dearly, mainly in lawyers' fees (BTW: his wife, Melissa, is a lawyer). Thus, with Mr Hunt's history of sueing everybody who has an opinion in the typographic world, i would be a fool to carry on. By now, everybody on this forum will have formed their own opinion.  <BR> <BR>Let's go back to where this thread started: <BR>We all agree that tradenames need protection against rip-off artists, and  that our libraries need to be protected against pirates. We also seem to agree that it is at least frivolous if not downright petty and vindictive when foundries get pursued for using generic terms like &quot;Grotesk&quot; in naming their fonts. We probably also agree that the type-buying public can differentiate between a name like Signa and one like Signata, especially if the typefaces involved look totally different from each other. And finally we agree that designers should be paid properly for their work through contracts that are fair and easy to understand. The fact that numerous well-known designers have chosen not to enter into contractual agreements with the self-declared Berthold successor in Chicago speaks for itself. <BR> <BR>Private business has nothing to do with this issue. There are many designers out there who know what i am not allowed to talk about as they have been party to the history of this conflict. They know my reputation and they know what the people in Chicago stand for. <BR> <BR>Judge for yourselves.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Erik, you clearly have no clue about trademarks and the value it would bring the type industry if only members of the type industry bothered to educate themselves. Although there are more and more type designers who read Typophile that are registering their trademarks, I am always amazed at how often Typophile posts include incorrect or inaccurate information regarding trademarks.  <BR> <BR>For example, you say that you have no problem with FF UNITE so long as the design is not the same as FF UNIT. You are doing yourself, your business and the type industry a serious disservice with this position.  <BR> <BR>If a designer created a typeface called HELVETICAR or HELVETICAL, Linotype certainly would have a serious problem with that designer regardless of whether the design looked like HELVETICA. <BR> <BR>Trademark law is intended to give a exclusivity to the first company/person who registers (or in the U.S. first peron who uses) a particular trademark in connection with PARTICULAR GOODS. The goods in our industry are FONTS; for purposes of trademark law, there is no distinction between the design of one font versus the design of another font: the registered trademark applies to all fonts (not a particular font design). <BR> <BR>For this reason, the US trademark office refused FSI's application for SIGNA citing Berthold's SIGNATA as a barrier. <BR> <BR>After the Barmeno/FF New Barmen fiasco which you started, FSI is now held to a higher standard not to come anywhere close to the Berthold trademarks. <BR> <BR>If, at the time, Berthold was not trying to cause FSI &amp; its FontShop Network to stop selling counterfeit Berthold fonts offered by BSK/Babylon Schrift Kontor, there is no way we would have ever allowed FSI to continue using the name FF SIGNA. Business disputes require compromise so we compromised.  <BR> <BR>Trademark law also does not require that the infringer use the EXACT trademark. The US requires only that the mark be &quot;confusingly similar&quot; and looks at the facts and circumstances of the situation. Other jurisdictions (e.g. England) also do not require use of the EXACT trademark to find infringement.  <BR> <BR>Contrary to your apparent assumptions, the type buying public is a much broader group than type and graphic designers. Therefore the type buying public would likely have difficulty distinguishing between trademarked type names with slight differences. Also because the type buying public relies more and more on purchasing over the web without assistance from people knowledgeable about type, and because they rely on search engines (dedicated to type like MyFonts or otherwise like Google), using similar typeface names could cause confusion to buyers. <BR> <BR> <BR>FONTSHOP, THE SPIEKERMANNS AND THE DOUBLE STANDARD <BR>Both Gustav Jaeger and Mrs. Poppl have not signed agreements with any Berthold successor after H. Berthold AG declared bankruptcy in 1993. <BR> <BR>Notwithstanding, in 1994 when Joan and Erik Spiekermann's FontShop were distributing the Berthold typefaces (via an agreement with Berthold Systeme), Erik produced FontBook update 2, the introduction stated <BR> <BR>&quot;This shows the 1400 typefaces in the Berthold Type Library released by Berthold in Berlin, Germany. Many of these fonts are available from other type sources, but the Berthold versions are renowned for their sensitive interpretation.&quot; <BR> <BR>Was Erik talking about cheating designers like Jaeger or Poppl then? Of course not. FontShop (and Erik) were making money from the Berthold typefaces. <BR> <BR>AND, more recently the FontShops were (and some still are) making money selling counterfeit Berthold fonts offered by BSK/Babylon Schrift Kontor denying Lange (Erik's close friend of many years) and Moellenstaedt (a past ATypI board member who he has known for decades) money for sales of their typefaces. <BR> <BR>Did Erik Spiekermann complain about cheating Berthold type designers? No. <BR></div>

The US requires only that the mark be &#34;confusingly similar&#34; and looks at the facts and circumstances of the situation. Other jurisdictions &#40;e.g. England&#41; also do not require use of the EXACT trademark to find infringement. <!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious. Is this because those who wrote the law and &#34;lawyers&#34; in general don&#39;t see and haven&#39;t been educated to the differences? It assumes a lot to say that &#34;typophiles&#34; are probably alone in seeing the minute differences. Granted it also assumes a lot that they aren&#39;t alone. But isn&#39;t that where the law falls apart and fails us? They write a law but don&#39;t bother to see the possible differences? &#34;What ARE typefaces ... who cares ... it is all Times, Arial and Verdana.&#34; It seems to me that this law needs some brushing off and cleaning up if something as simple as a few letters or a vague descriptor is giving people the right to go to court. What a waste of energy. I suppose I do understand wanting to protect what you worked to create. But with something like type ... word gets around ... most anyone who is going to license type and understands the investment they are making will shop around and ask around ... typophile is proof of that, we get questions all the time. Why would we suggest Signata if what they really want is Signa? The name, at the end of the day, is irrelevant to the person who will license the type. It is actually the design that counts the most. I have had clients ask me the difference between Times Roman and Times New Roman, I know that it is only typophiles that are interested. <BR> <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>On another similar note. I&#39;m curious about contracts for use of their designs. In the world of design, and as I understand it, once a contract expires or if no contract is signed, the ownership of the artwork reverts &#40;or is always&#41; with the designer. Isn&#39;t this the same with typeface design? I&#39;m referring to the GAG Handbook of Pricing and Ethical Guidlines ... According to the Fair Practices Act sections 359.350 &#40;Definitions for ORS 359.350 to 359.365&#41;, 359.355 &#40;Art work reproduction rights retained by artist unless expressly transferred; effect of federal copyright laws&#41;, 359.360 &#40;Ownership of physical work of art remains with artist unless expressly transferred&#41;, 359.365 &#40;Ambiguity in agreement transferring right to reproduce art work resolved in favor of artist&#41;  <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m driving at, in my own inarticulate manner, is while a typeface name and design may be trademarked ... or is the design only copyrighted ... by a given foundry, shouldn&#39;t the design itself revert back to the originator of the design? <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>If you can trademark a word, but names are too ambiguous you must add a word that somehow makes it unequivocal, what is the difference from this to just adding a few letters? <BR> <BR>If we look at the following examples, and I&#39;ve stuck to the two foundries which have been discussed, maybe someone can explain these to me. <BR> <BR>ITC Esprit, 1985 &#40;which FontShop carries&#41; <BR>Sayer Esprit, ? <BR> <BR>Signata, 1994 <BR>Signal <BR>FF Signa <BR> <BR>All different. Is it okay then for a foundry to work against itself? I&#39;m sincere in my questions, for once I&#39;m not trying to be cheeky. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">A quick side note for Mr. Hunt: As far as I know, the various FontShops are actually independently owned/run businesses, so I don't think that what any individual FontShop is selling has anything to do with Spiekermann &amp; Co. <BR> <BR>From their &quot;About FSI&quot; page: <BR> <BR>FSI (FontShop International), founded in 1990, is a renowned type foundry based in Berlin, Germany, with an office in San Francisco, USA.  <BR> <BR>FontShops <BR> <BR>FSI are Licensors of the FontShop concept. There are 6 independent FontShops in Europe, Australia, and USA.  <BR> <BR>That said, I'd love to hear you argue that the use of the word &quot;city&quot; in the name of a typeface is going to lead to consumer confusion.  That's almost akin to trying to trademark &quot;Greek&quot; or &quot;Type&quot; or &quot;Hand&quot;! Perhaps you should simply make a crappy typeface (not that the original Berthold typefaces are crappy) for every potential generic font name soon-to-be in existence and put all future competitors out of business! <BR> <BR>Or perhaps someone in the Typophile community should register the name &quot;Berthold&quot; for numerous types of products beyond the reach of your current trademarks, if for no other reason than to try to create some REAL customer confusion and give you a taste of your own medicine! <BR> <BR>I guess I'm just wondering why you're in this business at all - there are so many other way to make much more significant amounts of money if you're willing to be as ruthless as you've demonstrated.  Are you actually a typography enthusiastic to any degree?!? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">So now that I've gotten the satire out&hellip; <BR> <BR>What many lawyers and apparently the USPTO don't get is the  <BR>reason the fonts in the above post do not get confused is  <BR>because the fonts look completely different. We're not talking  <BR>about knock-off Kate Spade handbags or fake Swiss Army  <BR>watches. <BR> <BR>Mr. Hunt, with all due respect, and with the humor aside. I hope  <BR>you'll see that people hold Berthold products in high esteem,  <BR>otherwise they would've stopped paying attention a long  <BR>time ago. If the Berthold fonts sucked we would've changed the  <BR>channel. Now is your chance to show that Berthold is worth  <BR>preserving for the craftsmanship of it, not petty font names. <BR> <BR>Regardless of the technicalities of the law, regardless of your  <BR>ability to present a case in court and win, I hope you realize that  <BR>the nature of your lawsuits <i>seem</i> frivolous to those familiar  <BR>with the profusion of similar font names. That's the business  <BR>you bought in to. <BR> <BR>I think it's safe to assume that you started this thread in order to  <BR>clear the Berthold name. I realize nobody is on trial in this  <BR>thread. There's no judge or jury here. But what is at stake is the  <BR>collective perception of the Berhold name. <BR> <BR>If it's true that a brand is nothing more than a collection of  <BR>perceptions in your customers' minds&hellip; And obviously you value  <BR>the Berthold name or you wouldn't desire to protect it by setting  <BR>some facts straight&hellip; If these are true I hope you can see that the  <BR>way to gain positive influence can't be gained in a court - and  <BR>certainly not with the heavy handedness you <i>seem</i> to have  <BR>shown over what <i>appears to be</i> trifling issues. <BR> <BR>In court you have had some wins, but in the public mind you  <BR>look like the playground bully. The branding lesson here is that  <BR>whether you are a bully or not is irrelevant. What is relevant is  <BR>what your customers think, and to a large degree what you do  <BR>next, because, whether you like the attention or not, people are  <BR>paying attention. Given the respect people have for Berthold  <BR>products I think it's safe to assume they don't want to see  <BR>Berthold fail. Let Berthold succeed by being innovative or  <BR>intelligent or creative or hard working or quick to market or&hellip;  <BR>pick an attribute people can believe in. <BR> <BR>I didn't really intend to write an op-ed piece. I'm not privvy to  <BR>whatever litigation has happened. Frankly I don't really care who  <BR>said what - and that's kind of my point. When it comes to your <BR>branding issue - where brand equals reputation - those details <BR>matter less than the perceptions you create by seeming to wield  <BR>an iron fist or by seeming to letting your counsel speak for you.  <BR>Or by sending letters over light-weight issues. <BR> <BR>I hope you'll take this in the spirit it's intended: with respect for  <BR>the heritage you entrust, the designers you employ and with  <BR>hopes for a better future for Berthold.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is indeed hard to figure out the initial intention of the thread. If it is bullying tactics which are harming our industry, then we feel the need to add to the topic. Designers shouldn't be put off trying to register their type names to offer some kind of protection from the law. The more pertinent problem is that very few people in our industry can afford to defend themselves in the sort of cases brought against them, many are outrageous, but to defend the accusations: reckon with 6 figure sums and twice or three times that to take it to court. <BR> <BR>FSI like most other companies and individuals, has never been able to take the issues to a full-blown court case with a judgement when attacked, where outcomes would have quite probably been completely different. The amount of money spent on injunctions, lawyers etc. meant that we have had to withdraw and agree to settle. In this respect, bullying tactics is an apt description and seems to be a pattern. We have always had to agree to settlements in the end, no matter how long we tried to hold out. Financials aside, humans eventually run out of steam too and are beaten down. But a legal Agreement doesn't necessarily mean that parties are in agreement - it's always a pragmatic matter of &quot;do we go bankrupt defending further&quot;?  <BR>  <BR>Mr Hunt states: &quot;For this reason, the US trademark office refused FSI's application for SIGNA citing Berthold's SIGNATA as a barrier.&quot;  <BR> <BR>When FSI applied to register FF Signa, the US trademark office initially turned it down on the grounds that it was similar to &quot;Signata and FF Signa&quot; (really, the name of our own font was cited against us as being similar, we have the letter!) It is very common, and has happened to FSI many times, that the initial application is turned down, especially if someone objects to its registration. You then show reasons why the name and font is different and it is then often accepted. In this case it was Berthold Types who objected and it was abandoned by FSI because Berthold Types began a long, exhausting and complicated case against FSI and FontShop Germany tying in this registration with other FontShops' selling (legal) BSK fonts along with FF CityStreetType, FF Avance and other issues.  <BR>We are still convinced that we would have succeeded in registering FF Signa and others had it not been for yet another case which cost all of FSI's financial and emotional resources.  <BR>Some &quot;confusing&quot; font names could spark a whole new thread, see already, and we list a few below for interest. There are hundreds more similar names, so FSI may be forgiven for the suspicion that a certain amount of harassment is involved in their case. We feel angry and sorry for the people who have been forced to remove &quot;City&quot; from their font names. FSI were &quot;allowed&quot; in their agreement to continue to use the name FF CityStreet Type under the  <BR>condition that it did not try to register it.  <BR>  <BR>Look at the first example! <BR> <BR>Joan Spiekermann and Petra Weitz, Managers FSI (FontFont library) <BR> <BR>Badoni, Agfa  <BR>Bodoni, Linotype  <BR> <BR>Aldus, Adobe  <BR>Aldous, Agfa  <BR> <BR>Albertus, Monotype  <BR>Albertan, Lanston  <BR>Albertina, Monotype  <BR> <BR>Alexa, Adobe  <BR>Alexia, Alphabets  <BR>Alexie, Linotype  <BR>Alexander, Lunchbox  <BR>  <BR>Arbiter, Berthold  <BR>Arbitrary,</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It appears to me from this thread that Berthold has not won lawsuits about names, but rather has used the cost of litigation as a business tactic to hurt rivals.  <BR> <BR>A possible way to diffuse this might be to get one of the type organizations to set up a clearing house to approve font names. Then a single failed lawsuit against a cleared name - which the type community might chip in to defend - might stop the practice.  <BR> <BR>I would add that this first idea might not be best but perhaps by brainstorming solutions here, the community could come up with a good plan.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What's done is done, and there are lessons to be learned. <BR>From the type designer's perspective, here is a &quot;play it safe&quot; strategy for the future: <BR> <BR>1. Type designers should avoid doing revivals. <BR>This will minimize problems of plagiarism, and naming issues (too close a name, or one unrelated &ndash; both are problematic for revivals) <BR> <BR>2. Type designers should publish their own work. (Since the Internet, this is a viable option.) <BR>In other words, type designers should publish their work under their foundry name, and then market it themselves and/or through distributors. <BR>If you have someone else publish your typefaces, no matter how great things are today, that company's ownership may subsequently change hands in ways that may not please you, and over which you have no control. It will be too expensive for you to defend your interests. <BR> <BR>3. Type designers should be very careful in naming their typefaces: the best strategy is to use made-up words that are not already in the dictionary. For the first letter of the name, choose an area of the alphabet less colonized by other typeface names, and so on. <BR>Quite apart from legal issues, giving your face a name that is unlike any other can only enhance the strength of its brand in the marketplace.</div>

I never hide my own personality, but we all should respect another kind of thinking. Isn't it? <BR>Grazie mille e cari saluti! <BR> <BR>&gt; I don't want a letter from Chicago <BR>&gt; as anybody knows a confrontational letter (especially when directed to individuals with modest or non-existent legal resources) can have nearly the same effect as a lawsuit <BR> <BR>This is one of very serious reasons. I want to give one advice to those people who are afraid the attacks from Berthold. The majority of my friends and attorney worldwide came to similar opinion: <BR> <BR>- &quot;Issuing a lawsuit, in the US, is an everyday practice, even for reasons which, in other nations, would not justify a legal action. The Berthold case is a good example of this kind of approach: the company issues a lawsuit to scare a potential competitor. Anyway, on a factual level, we have to consider this: laws are not the same in any single part of the world and it's very likely there's no way to make a US Tribunal judgement effective in Russia as well. It may even be that on a specific topic Russian law is very different. <BR>If, as I believe, we are still in an earlier phase before an actual legal action, I'd be quite relaxed to tell Igor he could use Berthold's papers to wipe his&hellip; nose.&quot; <BR> <BR>- &quot;I could have demonstrated to the court just how silly Berthold's claims were&hellip;&quot; <BR> <BR>Dear friends! If You receive the &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; letter, do not fear! Please take a look at my own position: <a href="http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm">http://fontcity.ru/ev.htm</a></a>, read the Russian attorney opinion: <a href="http://fontcity.ru/attorney.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://fontcity.ru/attorney.htm">http://fontcity.ru/attorney.htm</a></a> and other stuff.

		<div class="commentbody">Albertan was designed by me as a private metal face for my press, Pie Tree Press. If there is any confusion about the bame being confused with Albertus or Albertina, I could care less. The type is named for my wife, Alberta who was by coincidence, born in the province of Albertan, and is thus an &quot;Albertan&quot;. When I cut the type in her honour I had no intention that it would travel outside the confines of my letterpress sanctuary (which by the hour becomes more and more attractive to me) so the name was not a matter of confusion. If I had intended from the start that the type would be sold to the outside world I would still have named it for her. As has been stated, we can tell the difference from Bodoni This or Bodoni That, so I don't understand the confusion, if you will pardon the cheek of a &quot;typographical nobody&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

The publisher is the person/business who holds the trademark. <BR> <BR>Contrary to what Thomas says (and I speak from practical experience), it IS difficult to get one's fonts &quot;published through someone else&quot; and retain rights, because most publishers will not publish typefaces unless they own the trademarks.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, you are either not understanding what I wrote, or not understanding trademarks. Names such as Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon, Jenson and Bodoni cannot be trademarked for typefaces. They are in the public domain. By bringing up a name such as Gill Sans, which IS a trademark, you are likely to confuse people. It is not hard to find out if a name is trademarked. <BR> <BR>Certainly, revivals are just that, and are not as original as new designs. I also don't see any point in doing a revival of something that is available from the original type foundry in decent digital form. However, this is a distinct issue from &quot;am I going to get into trouble by doing this.&quot; <BR> <BR>Nick writes: &quot;It IS difficult to get one's fonts 'published through someone else' and retain rights, because most publishers will not publish typefaces unless they own the trademarks.&quot; <BR> <BR>This is simply not true. ALL the biggest type foundries (Agfa Monotype, Linotype and Adobe) license designs from third parties where the third party retains the trademark. <BR> <BR>However, at Adobe we generally have the copyright for the font software, even for trademarks we license from third parties. This is the case not because we are eager to own some piece of the pie, but because we want to do production work in-house due to quality concerns. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Exactly, John B. Not to mention <b>many</b> other such typefaces Adobe has published in the last 10 years where the trademark is still with the individual designer. Agfa Monotype has certainly done tons of these as well, licensed from individual designers who still hold the trademark.

I note that ParaType sells an entirely different design called &quot;Russian Souvenir&quot; (1996), so I suspect that ITC's trademark only applies to the combined phrase, but I don't know for sure. Certainly Adobe's trademarks on Adobe Caslon, Adobe Jenson and Adobe Garamond only apply to the two words together (though we also have &quot;Adobe&quot; as a trademark). <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Nick is talking complete nonsense in this area. <BR> <BR>Thanks for straightening me out, Thomas. Despite many hours spent poring over contracts, the significance frequently escapes me. I checked the contracts (licence agreements) that I have with several foundries and found that either I retain the trademarks, or if not, they revert to me when the agreement is ended.  <BR> <BR>The only caution related to this, and I can't reveal which contract(s) it's in: if the contract is ended by either party, and the type designer subsequently decides to market either the font software or the trade name, then the original publisher is entitled to a cut of the revenue, based on its contribution to the font software or brand equity built up in the trade name by its marketing. The percentage to be negotiated.  <BR> <BR>In a situation where the publisher holds the copyright to the font software, but not the trademark, then if the designer wants out, and decides to market the typeface elsewhere, that could be problematic &ndash; presumably he/she would have to create a font with somewhat different software than the original publisher's.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ouch, that would be a painful contract to deal with, afterwards! I can see the reasoning behind that clause, but still&hellip;. <BR> <BR>With regards to font software copyright, all I can say is that when it's a non-exclusive license arrangement with Adobe, it seems to be the case that the designer can take the same stuff they gave us, and license or modify it as they please. This was at least the case with Arcana. Although we will provide Gabriel the version that we have done our work on, he cannot take that version and license or sell it to others. However, whether this works for everyone depends on their particular contract terms; this should not be taken as a general comment about all such non-exclusive contracts, or even all of Adobe's non-exclusive type licensing contracts. <BR> <BR>Beyond this, I figure I ought to bow out of this discussion. The whole thing is ultimately a legal minefield, and I imagine Adobe's lawyers would rather I did not discuss this stuff, given the litigious age we live in.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, a plague on North American PC, which will get you censored for <em>not</em> using a four-letter word! (and regarding which, see Nikki Finke's latest column in LA Weekly, which you can get off the Drudge Report) &hellip; but I ought to apologize for witlessness, because if I had my wits about me, I would have brought up my one experience with trademark infringement, i.e., when Adobe sent me a slew of threat letters warning me against using 'their trademark' and 'their typeface data' in any product of my own. Needless to say, the trademark and data they referred to were mine. I told Adobe I was using the data regardless, and if they didn't like it they could sue me. As that was some years ago and I haven't heard a word from them since, it seems clear that their threat was empty, designed merely to scare a designer whom they had treated badly. One thing I have observed: when an industry is growing, there is no litigation; when an industry is dying, there is nothing but litigation.  <BR> <BR>What effect did it have on me? I went from working on type for at least 60 hours a week, to working on type for about 60 hours a year. The advantage is that I started doing some other interesting things that were important to me; the disadvantage is that I would have preferred to work on type, but who could deal with such a poisonous environment? I didn't go into type to be reviled and sued by unspeakable persons like Adobe's Donna Kolness. I went into type to create beautiful text.  <BR> <BR>That said, I am looking at a contract from a perfectly nice foundry, but I can't yet bring myself to sign it. I fear what may follow. However, this time around, if it actually happens, I ought to have enough experience to sign a better contract. I never looked at Adobe's contract - I was too happy to have it. I trusted them implicitly, believed in their fundamental goodness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In addition to my previous posts, following are additional points: <BR> <BR>The Berthold Exklusiv Collection was conceived by GGL about 50 years ago and completed by the time he left H. Berthold AG in 1990. <BR> <BR>The type business was very different back then as the Berthold typefaces were specific to Berthold equipment, as was the case with Linotype and Monotype. When a designer had one of their typeface designs published by Berthold, the agreement provided that Berthold was the owner of the intellectual property rights because of the high costs of bringing a Berthold typeface to market.  <BR> <BR>The creative process of digitizing and creating the full character sets were done under GGL's supervision at the Berthold Type Atelier in Munich. In most cases only the essential characters were digitized and then the remaining characters were then created by Berthold. H. Berthold AG was always listed as co-author of the typeface designs. <BR> <BR>The font software for the Berthold Exklusiv Collection was developed by Berthold. When Berthold Types took over the library, Poppl and Jaeger insisted on renegotiating their original contracts and wanted ownership of the Berthold copyrighted font software. <BR> <BR>Albert Boton had already made a deal with another foundry (using Berthold's copyrighted data) for the other typeface in the Berthold library and only wanted to sign an agreement with the typeface Boton and have Berthold withdraw Agora. <BR> <BR>Berthold typeface designs can be found in the libraries of Bitstream, E+F, Linotype, Paratype, Scangraphic and URW all used without permission with no money going to Lange, other Berthold designers, or to Berthold for that matter. <BR> <BR>FF Blur is Lange's AG Old Face processed through Photoshop with the &quot;blur&quot; filter. FSI does not pay Lange royalties or Berthold for use of the data to create a derivative. <BR> <BR>Problems with typeface names were virtually non-existant (by today's standards) until the advent of PostScript and programs like Fontographer that enabled hundreds of people to produce fonts. Berthold's trademarks have been around for decades. <BR> <BR>With all due respect to Mr. Shipovsky (FontCity) but his Russian attorney's &quot;opinion&quot; is worthless in regard to U.S. and EU law. <BR> <BR>Finally, there is a co-existence agreement between Linotype and Monotype for the &quot;Times&quot; trademark and Adobe pays royalties to both companies for use of it. <BR> <BR>The fact that both companies use the &quot;Times&quot; trademark, therefore, should not be seen as the right to use other people's trademarks for new typeface names (e.g. Boogaloo Boulevard, Omicron Delta, City of &mdash; ). Boulevard and Delta have been trademarks owned by the Berthold foundry for decades.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to take a little point here, I suspect the 'Times' trademark is not capable of being defended because of its decades-prior use by ATF, for example, as in Times Gothic, a typeface shown (but not identified) by Tracy as an example of Will Ransom's design. 'Times Roman' perhaps, but not 'Times' per se in a typeface. In fact, if anything, Mono and Lino are in violation of ATF's rights for attempting to assert trademark ownership in any typeface containing the word 'Times'. One has got oneself into a very absurd position when one is reduced to discussing what rights Lino and Mono might have in Times and whether Adobe should be paying for those rights or not.  <BR> <BR>One wonders if there has been any friction between Agfa and Berthold over the use of tradenames such as Bembo? For example, Mono made it impossible for Scangraphic to sell its versions of faces such as Bembo, Perpetua, Centaur &amp; Poliphilus on the grounds that the license was for Scangraphic's proprietary format and could not be applied to the Postscript conversions.  <BR> <BR>With all this dreadful litigation going on, we still don't have a usable digital version of Bembo. The Mono version is incorrectly designed. The Berthold version is correctly designed but only has two f-ligs, and those incorrectly designed. The illegal Scangraphic design is also correctly designed but the five f-ligs are merely generic, much like Adobe's ahistorical f-ligs for the 'expert' versions of the Berthold faces they used to license. The last thing they were was expert. I wonder what drudge designed them? <BR> <BR>License, license, and litigation, yak-yak, and yet nobody ever solves the problems in the fonts. As the redoubtable Ed Mendelsohn said years ago, 'I would pay good money for a usable version of Bembo, and this despite the fact that I have two children to educate.' <BR> <BR>Harvey, the last time I saw you your jaw had fallen and you couldn't get it up. Is it now in working order?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A superficial glance reveals that if Brody used someone else's underlying font, it probably wasn't AG or AG Old Face but more likely one with a more open C. Harvey, do you have any proof N Brody did this? I'm open to persuasion but I'll require proof. That takes care of the first issue: did he do it? The second issue is, what does it matter? (In this particular case, that is, for a dozen obvious reasons.) <BR> <BR>And by the way, if you were going to use the PS Blur filter, why on earth would you bother to use a vector font as your input? You could use a scan of anything - that would be the obvious thing to do. For the moment you'll have to count me amongst the rude unpersuaded. <BR> <BR>And by the way, suppose Brody didn't use vector data, but used a scan from some old specimen book. Would you still have an issue with that?  <BR> <BR>Here's another question: to what extent is Concorde a Times clone? As I understand the story, it was intended as a Times clone, even though it doesn't really look like one. But in intent, it is, to a certain extent, a Times clone. Does anyone have an issue with that?  <BR> <BR>And what about that version of AG that actually is a Helvetica clone? Is Berthold expected to pay Lino, or the estate of Max Miedinger, royalties on that?</div>
