<div class=commentbody>First, you need to spell Advertising correctly. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>The bubble dots are looking a little bit like a crown, but that could be because I watched a show about Queen Elizabeth II the other night. What if you flopped it over? Or played with the dots a bit more to create more of an illusion of an arrow. e.g. forward thinking?? Or just rotate it 45</div>

<div class=commentbody>For a name as happy as YESYES I think you're missing some <br>opportunities to have fun with this. Looking at your older <br>posts I think the very first one had more potential. It was <br>lower case, first of all, wich seems more true to the name. <br>(Yes, it's basic typography where lower case = more <br>friendly. Of course that's cliche, but it has become cliche <br>for good reason.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiff> Gee... what a spelling failure <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> I must have been way too hasty posting this one... <br> <br>And you're all right about the crown. I had the idea of shaping a crown out of dots (sort of ironic reflection on my company) <br> <br>A while ago I read a discussion by some leading designers talking about their companies corporate identity... and how many dificulities that involved - looking inside the company etc. <br>They suggested trading design services - you do me I do you <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>The thing is I just moved into a new office and I need to get myself a firm stationary (no more "I'll just write my name and number on this napkin here!") So right now all my energy is focused on that "damn" logo <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Joe> I agree that a lower case indeed looks more friendly - but I'm having trouble finding the right font for that - can you recommend a typography? (bold and round preferably) <br> <br>Another thing is the letters "yesyes" - not very flexible and actually just the 3 same letters repeated. Though the name "yesyes" has a very good repetation in my town... not the logo but the brand <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Thanks again people! <br> <br>Kind regards, <br>/Henriko <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the name "yesyes" has enough power by itself. Maybe there in not reason to add an image (a crown, here) to the logo. Just play with "yesyes" and find something strong in this repeated word. <br>Excuse my bad english.<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm coming into this late so I've probably missed something. <br> <br>I like the YESYES treament. Bit of class to it. I'm assuming there is a similar reason for the idea of the "bubble dots." Instead of the crown though (reminds me of hotel signage or a soda pop logo) you might consider stressing the horizontal treatment you've already established and use them (the bubbles) as an interline rule between the two text lines. Perhaps going from small to large and then from large to small to provide a bit of a break in the tension between the lines. Keep the largest solid sphere the same size as the stem weight of the YESYES letterform, yes? <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Henriko. Any way you slice it, YESYES / YesYes / yesyes is a great name for an agency. I agree with Santiago, you may not need a mark when you've got a word this strong. Also with Tiffany's thoughts above about your latenight version, though at that size I'd tighten up the letterspacing. <br> <br>Finally I have to also agree with Joe: Try something fun. It may not be right in the end but give it a shot. Check out Hello Design an example of what we mean (sorry joe if I'm way off). Your name has a similar appeal. <br> <br><a href=http://www.hellodesign.com target=_blank>http://www.hellodesign.com</a> <br> <br>Regards, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just a note on type design: <br>e ending is little bit long <br>reverse for y ending, little too short <br> <br>Finally the s is quite soft on the middle compared to quite built letters. Perhaps make the e and y counters little little bit more round & less angular? <br> <br>On design side, I prefer the top than the bottom one for the image size / position.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I agree with JFP about the letters. The e looks like it is sticking it's chin out, and the s does seem so soft next to the semi-rigidity of the y & e -- The tonality of the orange seems too dark compared to the grey. Maybe add a little more cmy to the grey. Or tone down the orange. However, if you are trying to be a friendly and service-oriented agency, and saying that with your logo, you might want to kick the saturation up a bit. <br> <br>Are you asking about the smile in your logo and why it might not be such a good thing? I'm glad you changed your colors. It did look a bit like an airline. But, I wasn't entirely opposed to the concept behind the usage. <br> <br>Here are a couple places to visit. <br> <br><a href=http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/986150.html target=_blank>http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/986150.html</a> <br><a href=http://www.splorp.com/critique/ target=_blank>http://www.splorp.com/critique/</a> <br> <br>But, on the otherhand...in my opion...while some logos don't need concept...well, I think a concept is highly important. A good concept, even hinted at in your logo, can set the stage for a strong identity for the company. I'm sure I'll get shot down for saying this, but take for instance the Amazon logo. The smile that they incorporated in their logo reflects what they do for their clients (me). When I get home and see that box on my doorstep, I do smile. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with the both of you > JPF and Tiff. <br>The characters are too angular and vary to much as well (was that english??) <br> <br>Anyway I've kinda gone back to an older design (posted some time ago) where there are no swooshes or sodapop logos in sight <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>My company has a friendly tone in its service and I don't think I really need a symbol to support that - the name is a friendly brand <br>"YESYES - of course we can do that!" <br>(big smile inserted here!) <br> <br>I like the typography in this attached version though it needs some adjustments for sure! <br> <br><a href=http://www.yesyes.dk/link/yesyes2003_index.jpg target=_blank>http://www.yesyes.dk/link/yesyes2003_index.jpg</a> <br>(an early state of my website - this is just to see how the logo acts online) <br> <br>But the logo needs a tiny little detail that will make it an identity! - what is it? <br> <br>Tiff > Amazon is the best! They supplied me with many smiles lately <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br>BTW: Do you have a portfolio of some kind online? <br> <br>[Starting up Illustrator...] <br> <br>Thanks again, <br>/Henriko <br> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/9150.jpg alt="yesyes phase 15 and evolving..."></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the smiling swoosh design, even though I hate swooshes. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> It's well balanced, and the e's look like eyes. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the text on the 'half-circle mania' post (but drop the half circle thing) <br>I think the whitespace around the letters is interesting. Could you emphasise this - maybe by using outline letters? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I hate to see a graphic designer struggeling like that. It also reminds me of myself from some years ago. <br>I see you start to produce a battery of logos that have no meaning. Just to change the font make no sense. <br> <br>How about something like this? I agree with the earlier posts that you, with a name like that, need no sign / swoosh or any other kind of destraction. The name for itself is strong enough and can be modified to something interesting. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11886.jpg alt="YESYES by LucidDream"> <br> <br>This is just a quick sketch bases on your earlier post. I liked that font, easy, uncomplicated, but interesting. <br>My 'S' needs some plastic surgery, but I think you know what I mean. <br>Just by playing with the anatomy of the font you can, with little means, create something interesting. The first thing I do with creating logos is converting the font to vectors. Then the party really starts. <br> <br>I hope I could help you a little bit. <br> <br>Ren</div>
