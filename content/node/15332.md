  body: Well, the glpyhs don't match up exactly... which leads to the conclusion that

  body: "Is it possible that this is just drawn by hand? \r\nThe U is not exactly
    the same in LOUDS (right serif sticks out, upper right corner is thinner and curved
    different to the other two instances), upper S serif is slanted more in LOUDS. "
