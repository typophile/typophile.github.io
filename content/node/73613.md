body: "I'm just wondering, as I've noticed I've paid more attention to the form of
  my handwriting ever since I developed an appreciation for various typefaces. For
  example, I started to add a tail onto my Gs due to the influences of Helvetica and
  occasionally try to write my Rs like the Helvetica Rs. Also, for a time I tried
  to make my question marks similar to that of Futura and tried adding a flag to my
  1s, again influenced by Futura. \r\n\r\nSo have any of you changed your handwriting
  due to the influences of a particular typeface?"

  body: Not yet, but I'm reading a book set in Tekton, which is based on the author's
    handwriting, and it's got me thinking about trying to improve my handwriting a
    little bit. Though my handwriting is a horrible.

  body: Calluna inspired me to try to add more directional flow into my handwriting.
    It was never really too messy, but it certainly was not a pleasant read. I think
    it's much more smooth now.

  body: "I try to write as quickly as possible, time's running out. This means my
    handwriting is a matter of getting something on paper at high-speed, not necessarily
    conducive to thinking \"what shall I make a particular character look like?\"\r\n\r\nMaybe
    this is one of the reasons I can't understand why anyone wants a font to resemble
    handwriting. Since one of the basic premises of handwriting is speed, why would
    I then wan't anything to look like a handwritten form when, in type design, I
    have got time to make a character look exactly like I want it to without the limitations
    of a hand on a pen governing how it should look. That would be illogical. Call
    me a Philistine if you like."

    and started doing double-storey ones; this was clearly influenced by type in general,

    \"strike your fancy.\" Handwriting is individualistic and you SHOULD keep doing
    what you are doing. I am sure that others will ultimately comment on your handwriting
    as it will look \"considered/thoughtful\" in the long run. \r\n\r\nTo me writing
    is enjoyable and gratifying... time well spent."

  body: "Michael, sorry I hope it didn't sound like I was taking a pop at handwriting
    as an art-form. I know we have had our exchanges before about whether type should
    look like handwriting (or would benefit from being based on handwriting in its
    basic forms) but I would never suggest that anyone who loves it shouldn't take
    their time and consider it time well-spent.\r\n\r\nI am writing less and less
    these days. I haven't written anything today, but may do the concise crossword
    in The Times later (upper case only, but that's a different thread)."

  body: "I overhauled my signature in high school, and my redesign was heavily influenced
    by Tolkien's F\xEBanorian Tengwar, with a lot of sharp descenders and a couple
    swashes.\r\n\r\nLikewise, I redesigned my messy handwriting in high school, shifting
    to a printed Roman drawn with different strokes many of which simulate serifs
    (on the B, D, I, J, P, R, and S), which greatly improved the legibility and readability
    of my printing. I didn't have a specific serif face in mind when I did the redesign,
    so it was probably Times New Roman that influenced it the most; still, clarity
    is one of TNR's virtues, so I could have chosen a worse model."

  body: Nick... no big deal. I was not upset and did not take your comments in a negative
    way. I know it is old fashioned to think the way I do, and I know time is precious
    and "writing" is not a priority. I hope you did not think I was taking a dig at
    you as that was not the case.

  body: When I was a kid about seven eight years old all the interesting books I could
    get (adventures, westerns, funnies etc.) were printed in twenties and thirties
    so they were set in blackletter. I even started to imitate it in my handwriting
    because I thought the text would become more interesting.

  body: "No. I used the cursive style I had learned at school by age 10. It became
    slicker by the time I was an adult, but had the same basic construction. Then
    around age 30 I studied calligraphy, and subsequently adapted my casual handwriting
    to use the proper joining rules of the chancery script.\r\n\r\nThe only typeface
    I've made from my handwriting is Panoptica Script, but it's not my everyday writing.
    Handsome, a script face, was \"written\" in Fontographer with a Wacom stylus,
    but the effect is too stiff and formal to bear much relationship to my \"real\"
    handwriting. One of these days I might make a typeface based on my writing."
