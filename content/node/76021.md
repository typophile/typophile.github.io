  much, so there are issues I'm running into.\r\n\r\nThis is for a metal band. Instead
  of just focusing on the heaviness, I wanted to emphasize the way the band uses epic
  smooth guitar melodies and harmonies in the music. \r\n\r\nI know there are issues.
  I'm having trouble resolving them, especially with \"The.\" I'm not sure how exactly
  to resolve some of these things. \r\n\r\nhttp://a.yfrog.com/img257/2165/absence3.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  critique/ suggestions or anything you think should be changed are greatly appreciated!!!!!!!"

    I found two things that stick out: your \"e\" on \"The\" seems to just scaled
    down from the bigger one, so the inlines are now too thin, so you should fix that.
    And just make that \"T\" stem upright,  and fix that flat-looking right-hand swatch,
    and you're fine.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/absence_5584.png]"
