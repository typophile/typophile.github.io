  body: "So readers don't confuse it with a baptismal font, used in a different kind
    of printing technology.\r\n\r\nAnother frequent piece of dumbass journalism is
    the use of \"typeface\" as a generic noun, as in \"his love of typeface began
    at an early age\"."

    ol' 386, which was long before 1998... Unless of course there were certain distinctive
    characters used in the report that were not released until 1998.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Windows 3.1 shipped in 1992 with TNR, but the laserwriter included Times outlines
    in 1985, and the font was of course popular in daisywheel and golf-ball impact
    printers and typewriters before that.

  body: "Actually, the use of \"type font\" may make sense here, to distinguish \"font\",
    as physical or digital instance, from \"type face\", which is a design capable
    of being expressed in various media by various hands. The idea being wrestled
    with, is that a particular font is a dateable iteration of a typeface design.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is that in popular usage, \"font\" has come to mean the same as \"typeface\",
    losing the distinction between the two. So while we may think \"type\" is a redundant
    prefix to \"font\", that's not so for the writer here, who may be attempting to
    re-establish the distinction."
