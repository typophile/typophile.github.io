  body: "Bojev\r\nThanks. I had looked at Tufte's books online and was impressed,
    although because my browser is playing up I couldn't view the pages.\r\nI might
    get a couple of Tufte's books to start with -- \"Envisioning Information\", and
    one other; any recommendations on the second book, given my specific requirments?\r\n\r\nSihep\r\nThanks
    as well. I have previously read the Infomation Design Journal and I know one or
    two of the staff at Reading Uni's Typo department, but I must of completley missed
    the website. I have a leaflet for John Benjamin Publishing advertising Rune Pettersson's
    Introduction to Information Design -- do you have this book? I wonder whether
    it discusses the philosophies of information design, or is a techinical manual
    -- the second would be preferable. \r\n\r\nPS love the photos on Flickr, really
    beautiful.\r\n"

    the 80s when he was king of the infographic.
