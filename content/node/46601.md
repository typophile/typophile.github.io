body: Looking for a non-Cooper early 1970s-style typeface to use as display type in
  a smart, non-ironic-because-it's-a-retro-piece sort of way. Any help is appreciated.

  body: Franklin Gothic Condensed is very '70s advertising' without being kitch or
    retro in an obvious way. Certainly smart but maybe too subtle? Bernhard Condensed
    would probably work as a serif version of the same theme.
