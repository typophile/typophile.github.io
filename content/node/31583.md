  body: Something like ITC Lubalin might work, it is not what I would think of initially
    but it alludes to tracks as you suggest, the slabs forming the rails and the verticals
    forming the slats.

    the steam record the font has the value of speed attached to it regardless of
    whether it says speed or not.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4468_4169.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think the same of Antique Olive Nord simply because of Air France's livery applied
    to Concorde.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AirFrance_5835.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    both cases, speed is not inherently present in the design until the association
    has been forged.\r\n\r\nLooking for a speed or movement connotation might not
    be right?\r\n\r\nIt all depends..."
