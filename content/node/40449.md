  your resolutions (72 dpi or higher) become successes.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try to
  be nicer to strangers, eat healthier (i.e. less fast food!), get my debts under
  control, learn to select type with verve, embrace color instead of hiding from it,
  and just be a better person/designer in general.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear what your
  resolutions are (or aren't). Hopefully, they'll be inspirations for all of us.\r\n\r\nMay
  2008 bring us all greatness."

    tobacco since age 14. In 24 years of smoking, on average, a conservative guess
    of 3 cigarettes per day (handrolled for the past 10 years), I have smoked roughly
    25,000 cigarettes. That's a lot of carcinogens. So here it goes, the grand daddy
    of New Year's Resolutions: I am going to quit tobacco.\r\n"

    oldstyle numerals. Those three short numerals and one tall one will be bothering
    me all year.\r\n\r\nConsider that the proportions of oldstyle numerals developed
    during the long period after the 13th century and before the 21st in which almost
    all years looked nicely weighted with either an ascending or descending second
    numeral. For the next 292 years we're stuck with occasional ugly number sequences."

    Visit my parents and make dinner for them every month\r\n* Take my father out
    next time he goes shopping clothing and help him find classy clothes for reasonable
    prices (okay this is really not immaterial, but the idea still is), then make
    a style guide, so he can do it himself the next time\r\n\r\nFor myself, I want
