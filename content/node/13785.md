  sans or something.....\r\n\r\nObviously this face has been played with quite a bit,
  but still love the 'o' and 'e'.\r\n\r\nAnyways, ideas around what this typeface
  actually is would be seriously helpful. \r\nThanks."

    this I saw the little ad for the FontShop and it was featuring this face. So,
    anyways, now I know. Thanks Typophile.\r\n\r\nIt's so great the way the world
    works... If you put energy out there, it definitely comes back to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.Schweizer\r\n\r\nwww.dragonmassive.com

    target=\"_blank\">Pump Triline</a>, but some of the letters seem to have a fourth
    line (the dots in the d and o, and the line in the middle of the n). Does anyone
    know if this was another variation of Pump, or is it just a custom job?\r\n\r\n
