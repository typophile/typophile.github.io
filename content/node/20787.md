    in details of letters. However, I couldn't find 'Done' anywhere. Dennis, can you
    give me an idea where to find it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    a big mystery for me.

    by Derek. I think it is the bold version which is #3 in the pack.\r\n\r\nI was
    recently asking about him, and a friend told me he is pursuing a career in a completely
    different field."

  body: "Duh! Sorry for being so dense. I only looked at one of the weights -- I must
    have picked the wrong one. I should have realized what you meant, and seen that
    the 'similarities' were too close. It is indeed #3 that was the Bold weight, and
    I looked at one of the condensed weights instead.\r\n\r\nCarolyn, I'm glad you
    got your answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: In all fairness, Michael made the ID. I just jumped on the bandwagon because
    Derek has been on my mind.
