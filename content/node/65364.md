  characters. And these aren\u2019t being drawn with sidebearings that can balance
  them out, so they can get really hideous in conjunction with L, O, J, figures, and
  so on. Is there some technical reason for not kerning slashes? Or do they just not
  get kerned because kerning them is a PITA and users don\u2019t care?"

    on the slash, Scotch Modern with kerning.\r\nOn the right, how it would look the
    other way around.\r\nIMO, the slash should not appear to favour either bedfellow
    with its proximity, and the \"counter\" spaces should be balanced.\r\n"

  body: "I think the answer to that is at least partly historical.\r\n\r\nIf you go
    through an old type foundry specimen book, you will find that a standard font
    consisted of upper and lower case letters, with the standard punctuation marks
    and the ampersand. Even parentheses, and the dollar sign and the symbol for pounds
    sterling were considered \"typographic accessories\". Later on, with Monotype
    and Linotype, a somewhat greater variety of characters would be made specific
    to each typeface, including (, ), $, and /.\r\n\r\nFor a given typeface, there
    would often be available matching small capitals, accented letters, and fractions.\r\n\r\nBut
    characters like +, =, *, @, # and % were sorts. There would be one or two generic
    versions sold by point size, not typeface."

    be spaced once for all glyphs. So we do and have kerned slashes and quotes since
    kern 1, (1989). I have noticed that quite a few founders only concern themselves
    with kerning the cases and have always assumed that they simply expect the user
    to kern the odd combination that gets in the way. \r\n\r\nWe feel our fonts should
    just work seamlessly unless the user tracks a lot... or something horrid.\r\n\r\nCheers!

    fonts that don't include the combinations of single-quote/double-quote. In English,
    at least, this combination occurs quite frequently, whenever there's a quotation
    within a quotation (whichever way around you prefer to use them -- singles first
    [UK] or doubles first [US]). I've gotten in the habit of globally inserting a
    thin space between them, so they don't run together into what looks like three
    single quotes together; but whether that amount of space will work really depends
    on the typeface.\r\n"
