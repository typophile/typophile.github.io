body: "Hi there! I just found this great forum about type and typography. It's great
  to see so many people on here who are actually in design and print industry. I enjoy
  designing as a hobby, but don't have any previous education on any of it. So forgive
  my ignorance in advance.\r\n\r\nI decided to embark on a very interesting journey
  - starting my own IT consulting company.  I am at the point where I need to have
  a logo for the company so that I can print business cards and stationary. The full
  company name is Adonai Technology Services. The word \"adonai\" simply means \"lord\"
  or \"master\". It is found in the Hebrew Old Testament and is one of the many names
  of God. The services that \"adonai\" offers are geared towards small and mid-size
  business. IT consulting is the best way to describe it. This includes: building,
  managing, and maintaining business computer networks, email and other communications.
  In the future I plan to offer web design services as well. \r\n\r\nI like all lower
  case characters for \"adonai\", it makes it more accessible (personal) and less
  corporate. I also like just the word \"adonai\" by itself without the \"Technology
  Services\". It makes it look less cluttered and creates interest in wanting to find
  out more what it is and what the company does.\r\n\r\nI really need your help guys
  with some ideas and suggestions for the logo. I am open to different colors and
  fonts. It's the worst trying to create something for yourself. It never is good
  enough.\r\n\r\n~Vitaliy\r\n\r\nHere is what i have so far: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/adonai_3534.gif]"

    derive from Herbet Bayer\u2019s universal alphabet, and hearken to design of the
    1920s/30s and the late 1970s ad early 1980s. I think that a tech company should
    use type that\u2019s more contemporary without getting into cheesy computer/scifi
    cliches.\r\n\r\nIf you want a cheap deal on a logo design I\u2019ve got a few
    weeks to kill before school starts...\r\n"

  body: I think you are right, jpad. I realized after a while that ABC (the TV channel)
    uses the same font for their logo. Do you have any font suggestions that are contemporary
    or not as cliched?

    Sans Normal Italic</a> would really look great in a logo if the square dot over
    <strong>i</strong> were changed to a round dot."
