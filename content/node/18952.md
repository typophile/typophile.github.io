  someone can identify what type face it is by just taking a glance. Yet, you guys
  do it for fun in the other forum! That's when I thought someone in here would be
  able to help or point me in the right direction, so I decided to make a post...\r\n\r\nI
  have to find information about the usage of Caslon in contemporary media and after
  the-best-I-could-do-in-one-week research, someone mention that Caslon is indeed
  still used in today's world - but they didn't say where!\r\n\r\nIn my research,
  I know that Caslon's in the US Declaration of Independence, George Bernard Shaw's
  work, Benjamin Franklin used some, and 18C Great Britain newspapers. None of them
  are even remotely recent.\r\n\r\nI thought that today's English newspaper would
  be a great place to start but I don't think I can identify the font used by myself.
  Because there's so many version of Caslon, I kept thinking that it might be one
  of those version I haven't got sample to compare with... I thought of asking bunches
  of them in the Type ID board but it would be a nuisance to other people who really
  need their type identify...\r\n\r\nThat's my situation. Please help!\r\nThank you
  very much for your time."

    spots to identify Caslon coud be lower case a and g (which are very distinctive

  body: The first "modern" use of Caslon was by the Chiswick Press, who in the late
    nineteenth century competed with William Morris' Kelmscott Press to produce books
    of more humane character than had been the norm for at least half a century. They
    inked heavily to reduce contrast and bring rich colour to the page, perhaps in
    imitation of Morris' (much inferior) Golden type. Thus were established two schools
    of the then-new typography, according very roughly to whether they preferred to
    imitate the 15th or the 18th centuries. Caslon was the major type of the latter
    school, most importantly represented by the very popular and influential type
    historian and printer Updike. A synthesis was effected by Bruce Rogers with Riverside
    Caslon, darker and more closely fitted than the original from which it was produced.
    A similar remodelling is Carol Twombly's for Adobe, which shows increased contrast
    and, once again, darker colour than was normal in 18th C Caslon printing, thus
    reversing one of Caslon's major departures from his own Dutch sources. Founder's
    Caslon is a pretty authentic revival, though it includes the random splodges of
    ink appearing in the specimen sheet that was its source; LTC Caslon is good, though
    too widely spaced for perfect digital printing; and I'm told that the best of
    all is Abrams Caslon, which I've never seen.

    is your source for this? 18th century printing generally had more ink spread,
    I believe, as it was done with coarser grained inks. It was also, I have read,
    done with dampened paper and a great deal of 'sock' into the paper to even out
    the impression, as 'height to paper' of the type was not so even. \r\n\r\nBaskerville
    was, I have read, instrumental in getting finer grained inks and better press
    techniques, removing the need for dampened paper. The overall result was a lighter
    or 'kiss' impression that had less ink spread and more consistent impressions
    for each letter. "

  body: 'Hi William, pre-Baskerville printing could be light too: it''s a myth, encouraged
    by the low quality of most English (and American) baroque printing, that it was
    all dark. Furthermore, some punchcutters, including Caslon, made their smaller
    sizes optically lighter than their larger, the opposite of what we might expect.
    Aldines in the ~13 pt roman of 1497(?) are very light compared to the much more
    familiar ~15 point of 1495-9 - indeed they''re no darker than metal Monotype Bembo
    on undampened paper often is.'

  body: "George, if most English and American printing was dark, then it is fair to
    say that most Caslon is dark by comparison to Baskerville.\r\n\r\nAlso your statement
    about Adobe Caslon vs 18th century printing of Caslon does not seem to me accurate.
    When I compare Adobe Caslon to the famous 1734 broad sheet of Caslon, Adobe Caslon
    does not look darker at text sizes. \r\n\r\nAlso eg. the Long Primer 1 of Caslon
    (10 point size), normalized for size, has thicker stems than the Pica II of Caslon
    (12 point size), contradicting your claim that the smaller sizes are lighter.
    \ \r\n\r\nI would be glad to be corrected if I am wrong, but it does seem to me
    that your views on Caslon here are not accurate. Can you post a scan of 18th century
    Caslon printing that is noticeably lighter than Abobe Caslon? Or give a reference
    about the lightness of 18th Century Caslon? "

  body: "It is fair to say that most printed Caslon is dark by comparison to Baskerville,
    but it is also true that Caslon cut text type with notably thin stems, much thinner
    than most of his Dutch predecessors. In Richard Southall's 'Printer's Type in
    the Twentieth Century', figure 28 shows 10, 11, 12, 14 and 16 pt Caslon, cast
    from his matrices and printed by G W Jones in 1924, scaled to a uniform width.
    10 to 12, the normal text sizes for octavos and quartos, are light, 14 and 16
    rather darker. Curves, as on e, o and p, are actually somewhat lighter at 10 than
    at 12 point, and the wider spacing reduces the perceived colour, though stems
    are a little darker. I'm afraid I don't have a scanner, but perhaps you might
    look at Founder's Caslon, also from a specimen sheet, which is overall lighter
    than Adobe Caslon despite the ink-press it includes.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think Bill
    knows rather more about this than I do: trust him, not me."
