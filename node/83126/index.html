  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there!

I've had no luck with my own research; Identifont, WhatTheFont, and FontWhatIs have also had no luck matching. FontShop's ID and research team haven't gotten back to me yet, either... and I'm running out of avenues and alleyways to look in!

So, ladies and gents, any one know what this typeface is? I can't imagine that it was a custom typeface...

Cheers!
danse.

A similar look and feel - nice. Unfortunately, it's on all their letterhead, and I'm trying to create a French equivalent logotype... I've also used a typeface as a placeholder - http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/good-eatin-aoe/regular/ I think it has a similar playful feel, but it's too tall, and the terminals, r's, a's, and s' aren't the right shape.

Anyone else have luck finding this typeface?

Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Justin_Ch,

Good question. McMaster Children's Hospital was founded in 1988, which is probably during the time when typefaces were converting to digital... though I do think it was digitized, as the digital file I have (with the outlined typeface) is very clean, with minimal vector-points, leading me to believe it was created / imported for the digital type workflow.

Below is the vector art, selected in Illustrator, imposed with the parent hospital's identity - Hamilton Health Sciences. (HHS's typeface is Lesmore Medium by Red Rooster.)

		<div class="commentbody">Another AOE font is Spruce, but the most obvious disconnect is the 'a'. I was hoping it had an alternate letter, but nope.

Remember that it's simple to distort letterforms, so you may be looking at something that has been stretched/flattened. Another trick that kills IDers is to swap a letter or two from a similar font. We can look all day for a combination of letters only to find out that more than one font was used.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mike,

Thanks for your comment - and everything you're saying is true. And the capital "C" is particularly squished in this typeface.

Taking Mike's comment into account, I think the letterform that will help identify this face is the lower case "r" - it seems to be pretty unique and I haven't come across one like it with other similar typefaces. Others' stems don't stand up enough, and the open counters almost always have a curvature to it and rise above the top of the stem, instead of being short, truncated, and flat. The "M" is also pretty unique, with a very upright posture, slightly wider shoulders, and having an "empire waistline" with the location of the vertex.

Anyone else have luck finding this typeface?

Thanks!
danse.
