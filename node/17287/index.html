  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,
I'm working on this typography project for a while but I'm pretty stuck here.I thought maybe some of you can advise me on some points with this project.
What i sould basicly do with this project was to choose a font. divide every letter into elements like I show at the top of the attachment.I chose the the font, I divided it and tried to make a new font out of it.

Well the thing is now I have this,but I'm not satisfied with a lots of things,
Maybe you should look and tell me your comments then I'll tell you the parts that I'm not satisfied with.

Thank in advance 

Lazyfish

		<div class="commentbody">The font you've created is not legible yet. A good font is designed for maximum legibility and one of the ways that happens is through simpliciation of forms. There are too many things happening in your design. My suggestion is; if you're going to take this approach of changing an existing font, start over and make only subtle tweaks. Every modification here that's distracting is essentially a point against legibility. 

Keep working!

		<div class="commentbody">hi there and thanks for the reply,
The thing is I'm a design student and this is my term project,personally i didn't like the idea of taking a font and dividing it to elements but what you gonna do, you know....
Anyways what I tried to show in the attachent was not a final look of the font but the different types of letters (like g and y) I mean I'm trying to find out a structure with these elements so that I'll be able to use for the rest.I'm not modifying the font, I'm taking elements from it and trying to create a totally different font.
So could you please be a little bit specific about the letters but not in general,

		<div class="commentbody">I'd love to give you lots of specifics but it's hard to get a feel for your concept or even the visual language you're seeking. The important thing now is to focus on the problems that you can identify and begin experimenting on tracing paper until you find a good solution. Stay away from working in the computer right now because it will only kill your progress. No computer is faster than the pencil. 

Keep asking yourself this...

What's making this illegible?

I would suggest rethinking the size and shape of your counter-spaces. The negative space within letters (like d and g) feels too busy and narrow. Perhaps get rid of the flat mantelpieces on the bottom left of each counter and just create a curve to round them out. The top part of your counter-spaces works ok because you've got the same thing happening in your other letters like "n". But again, they're not an identical match in proportion. Is there a reason why they're different? Copy and paste your path. The "r" and "s" need more attention. They feel chunkier than everything else and visually they need to look less like distant cousins and more like immediate family.

Create a system!

Create consistency. I'd get rid of the little random chunks at the bottom of the "a" and "e". On your "g" and "y", i'd make the descenders align to the grid and consider having them be the exact same shape with only enough variation to differenciate between them. You'll have to go back to the sketch pad for that. 

Hope my opinions help!

(Where's Nick, eh?)

I dunno about that - certainly not "maximal". But yes, I agree that
legibility is a central factor (although a lot less in a display face).

		<div class="commentbody">As I understand it, the assignment you've been given is to take one typeface, break it down into elements, and then reassemble it to form a new typeface.

Perhaps what's needed is a wider definition of "elements", and looser rules about how to reassemble them. For instance, you seem to have forbidden yourself even to rotate your puzzle pieces. And you've made life even harder for yourself by choosing pieces that are hard to use graphically. The rectangle and a quarter ellipse are just not from the same world as the subtle curves on the s stroke and the finnicky little sprig on the small stroke.

I must second Marty's point: every typeface needs a system! If some characters have big round serifs and others don't, why?

Finally, before you decide you've arrived at a workable system, make sure you have dealt with the characters h a m b u r g e f o n t s i and v. If your system deals with these well, it will probably make it through the rest of the lower case.

Best of luck!

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I think this is much better already, but there are still two ideas in this design: triangle and rounded endings.

"abcdegjosuvwy" are consistent.
"fhiklmnrtx" are still schizophrenic, i'd get rid of the rounded endings, but cut them straight. This works, because the other characters do have straight lines by themselves.
Don't try to overstress your concept. in "s" and "t", there's a too much of elements, maybe as well in "v" and "w".
"x" is still strange, i would simplify it.
get rid of the right triangle in the "m".
Try to avoid "chinese-calligraphic style" in the t-bar.
