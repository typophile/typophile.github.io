    version of the logo in the link is a bit different, but I'm sure Michael did the
    one in your sample as well.)"

  body: "You are correct Mark. All the text on my original design was hand-lettered.
    Unfortunately some time after I did it changes were requested and (apparently)
    the agency had lost track of who had done the original (me!), so the hack job
    that is used now was created, I'm\u2014assuming done in-house. The script of the
    word \"Greatest\" is done so poorly that it's beyond me why Artslons would want
    to replicate it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fuddruckers_3671.gif]"

    GREATEST\" be around the circle, and \"Hamburgers\" be positioned under \"FUDDRUCKERS\"?\r\n\r\n

  body: Ha! You're probably right . . . but that's the least of the problems in that
    "revised" logo.
