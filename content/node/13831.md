body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Blackletter]] : Textura</strong>\r\n\r\nA style of
  [[Blackletter]]. Also called [[Gothic]] or [[Gotisch]].\r\n\r\nBy the 1100s, scriptoriums
  in and around Paris had so altered [[Carolingian Minuscule]] that the lettering
  styles of the day no longer bore any resemblance to those of c.800. This geographic
  area\u2014Paris and its environs\u2014held the avant garde of the mid-1100s onwards.
  The 1140s, for instance, saw the creation of the Gothic style of architecture in
  St. Denis, a Parisian suburb.\r\n\r\nThe name textura refers to the fabric-like
  quality of a page set in the script; \"textura\" literally means \"an even effect
  in weaving.\" Textura is often said to bear a stylistic similarity to this new style
  of art and architecture. Together with Gothic art and architecture, Textura spread
  across Europe, taking hold everywhere except Italy, which did not show much appreciation
  for the Gothic. Two types of textura flourished simultaneously: [[Textura Quadrata]],
  which features diamond-shaped heads and feet; and [[Textura Prescisus]], which is
  characterized by the absence of feet and an even baseline.\r\n\r\nBy 1400, virtually
  all books in Europe were written out in Textura hands. When [[Johann Gutenberg]]
  developed [[movable type]], he based his forms on Textura letters.\r\n\r\nAs printing
  spread outward from Mainz, the Textura style was quickly abandoned for [[Schwabacher]]
  and [[Antiqua]].\r\n\r\n[[Wynken de Worde]] brought a Textura font of type to England
  in 1480. [[Old English]] types of the 19th Century are sometimes based on typefaces
  that developed out of his contribution."
