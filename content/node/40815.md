body: "Looking at a brief sample of Clarendon LT Std Roman earlier (just the &!) I
  was pleased to be able to scratch that itch in my mind which said &ldquo;I've seen
  that in something particular\u2026&rdquo;: [[http://www.matadorrecords.com/images/fullsize/ole-311.jpg|Belle
  & Sebastian: The Boy with the Arab Strap]] (possible minor differences in weight
  aside &mdash; it's still a Clarendon and not Bold, Black, Heavy or Light)\r\n\r\nThere's
  another itch though: I have a feeling it's used in some (UK, I think) product or
  brand which I can't place.  Ring any bells?"

    check out the branding of [[http://www.bolton.gov.uk|Bolton Council]], by Hemisphere
    DMC, bringing Clarendon (with a slight modification to the l/c t) back to the
    public sector! '

  body: "I've got it!\r\n\r\nIt's [[http://www.abel-cole.co.uk|Abel & Cole]] (the
    logo's one of the heavier weights).  The itch said it was something, possibly
    food-y, with middle-class associations.  It deserves a pat on the back.\r\n\r\nHurrah!\r\n\r\nDo
    feel free to chime in now with other spottings as you like :)"
