		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben, drop a line to Kent or Tiff - they know a lot about what&rsquo;s in the WAD archives at BPL. Paul Shaw knows those archives like the back of his hand, but I believe he is in Europe right now and might be difficult to get in touch with. I am personally in love with his marionettes. Make sure you spend time in that room, which also contains other items from his study. Very cool. Ask for permission to take photographs. Their stated policy forbids photography, but they give permission on a case-by-case basis. I believe no flashes are allowed in the marionette room and the lighting is not ideal, but you should still be able to get great shots with your fancy gear.</p>
<p>Roberta Zonghi used to be the contact there, but I am not sure that she is still in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Dept. She was a wonderul resource. If she is no longer there, whoever is in her place should be able to help you. Call in advance and tell them you&rsquo;re coming so they can be ready to help you. The staff is really wonderful, and enthusiastic about their holdings.</p>
<p>Have a great time!</p>

<p>I replied to your e-mail, Eben. Give me a call if you need help trying to figure out which box something you&rsquo;re looking for might be in.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that you might also want to get in touch with Larry Oppenberg while you&rsquo;re out there. He could give you a good orientation to Linotype material in the Museum of Printing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I went there a couple of years ago while on vacation. It was a little awkward because they acted like &ldquo;why does this kid (I was 25 at the time) want to see the Dwiggins collection? Once I explained that I design type for a living, they relaxed a little. I just showed up and didn&rsquo;t call ahead so maybe think about calling ahead so they can prepare. Also, definitely get a library card. They would only let me spend about 20 minutes with the collection without one. I&rsquo;m going to the Newberry Library in Chicago next week and have already exchanged emails with the Custodian of the John M. Wing Foundation who was very nice and welcoming. I’m super excited to browse that collection. In retrospect I wish I had handled the BPL situation differently and will have to make plans to get back there to spend more time with it. Good luck!</div>

<p>Your Scruggs font is interesting it looks like things I have seen on old book covers and advertising from from the 1920s. Is your intent text or display?</p>
