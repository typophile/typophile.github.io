<p><img src="/images/old-images/unchart_5182.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, it seems, you are not the only one to assume that, yet I am unaware of a character called &ldquo;function symbol&rdquo; in mathematics. In  France, there is a tradition where capital letters and  Greek letters used in mathematical formulae are upright (and that is why the psi in my avatar is upright) but I am unaware of a mathematical tradition that would denote functions with small upright italic letters. If I use the LaTeX fourier package with the upright option to denote a function <em>f</em> from X to Y, I get this</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/function_6158.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The X and Y are upright (contrary to the American tradition) but the f is not.</p>
<p>[Edit] However, I have seen comments on another thread where it is contended that the florin should be slanted&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike, there are two independent questions here, the hook and the slant. Concerning the use, here is something interesting I found in Victor Gaultney&rsquo;s (pdf) text <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=Gentium_RU_spec&filename=Gentium_RU_spec.pdf"><em>gentium, a typeface for the nations</em></a>, and I cite:</p>
<p>  <em>The design of the italic f [in Gentium] allows a clear distinction to be made between it and the hooked version. Both are used for the Ewe language of Ghana.</em></p>
<p>and he gives the example:
<img src="/images/old-images/ufaital_5165.jpg" alt="">
I gather that in the regular, that should read
<img src="/images/old-images/ufareg_6116.jpg" alt="">
and that U+0192 should normally be upright in the regular and, in the italic, it should share it&rsquo;s slant.</p>
<p>As for the requirement of a hooked f in mathematical formulas, I am suprised at what you say but engineers may have conventions that mathematicians don&rsquo;t. Normally mathematics lowercase is italics and, in most fonts but not all, the italic f is hooked. So I looked at my math books to see if any would use a non hooked italic f to represent a function; I found a few nicely edited books from the Springer series &ldquo;Ergebnisse der mathematik&rdquo; (one of which is even printed in the USA) with f(x) written as in (1), which is less hooked than the non hooked gentium italic f. I found essentially the same f in two books published in France (2); I also found a little book from Mir publishers, Moscow, with an italic f(x) that is absolutely not hooked (3). Those books date from the sixties and seventies and are all &ldquo;graduate level&rdquo; pure mathematics.
<img src="/images/old-images/fofx_5671.jpg" alt="">
If you have any reference about that hook requirement, please let me know.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michel, you have done much more research on this than I have. I was an engineering student in 1962-67, when anything we did was done by hand. We didn&rsquo;t even have calculators, not to mention laptops. As long as what we wrote seemed to resemble the function symbol, that was good enough. Our textbooks were probably printed with metal type, and I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I paid too much attention in those days to what the function symbol f was like. At that point it would still be about 20 years until I started caring about fonts, or noticing details like that.</p>
<p>I tend to think that the &lsquo;requirements&rsquo; about this are just general conventions, and as long as the function symbol is distinct from the other lettering in the textbooks, no one would be confused. I have been told that mathematicians can be very particular about their symbols, but as long as I am not typesetting one of their books, I don&rsquo;t think I will worry about it much.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t even know what the &lsquo;f&rsquo; of this post was supposed to be &ndash; a vertical italic f, or a Florin symbol, or a function symbol &ndash; but it seems we have answered the question well enough.</p>
<p>I am impressed by your thoroughness though, and I have noticed that about you before. Well done.</p>

<p>Agreed, but the comment &ldquo;= function symbol&rdquo; for U+0192 in the unicode chart troubled me. I now had a look at the Unicode Technical Report #25, <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr25/" target="_blank"><em>Unicode support for mathematics</em></a>, which seems to solve my worry: U+0192 is not in the mathematical character repertoire: the report refers nowhere to any character in the range U+0100..U+01FF.</p>
<p>Solved for me too.</p>
