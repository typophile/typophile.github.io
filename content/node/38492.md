body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nOne can easily say Akira Kobayashi's AXIS sans is a beautiful
  distillation of Frutiger and Meta. Does it surpasses those types? Decide for yourself.
  \r\nTypeProject is releasing trial versions of the regular and condensed styles.
  \r\n\r\nI'm sure you'll see, like I have, AXIS presents text clearly, friendly,
  and yet is a fresh take on familiar informational type designs .\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/akira2_4745.png]\r\nhttp://www.typeproject.com/product/file/axis_cond_joyo_chars.pdf\r\nhttp://www.typeproject.com/product/file/axis_joyo_chars.pdf\r\nhttp://www.typeproject.com/product/download.html\r\n\r\n\r\nUse
  Google Language Tools to help you navigate the site. \r\nREMEMBER THIS IS A TRIAL-
  YOU WILL HAVE TO DELETE THE FONT FILES FROM YOUR MACHINE AFTER THE TRIAL IS OVER!\r\n\r\nMike
  Diaz :-)\r\n\r\nPS... Wouldn't it be nice for a latin only version of these type?"

    for Typeproject that designed AXIS.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll send an E-mail to him later.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, AXIS is used in various places, for example, [[http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/|Nintendo
    Wii website]].\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve used AXIS Condensed Bold recently. It worked fine.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I heard Akira Kobayashi designed the latin characters of AXIS. The chinese characters,
    Japanese Kana phonetic characters and so on were designed by Type Project, especially
    Isao Suzuki who workd for Adobe from 1993 to 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\nThanks for your introduction.\r\n\r\nIsao Suzuki (Type Project
    founder) asked Akira Kobayashi to design the Atlphabet parts of AXIS before Akira
    worked for Linotype. So all Latin, Greek and Cyrillic parts of AXIS standard ver.
    designed by Akira Kobayashi. And I've expanded the family of AXIS Condensed and
    Compressed version after Akira went to Germany. We've been preparing to release
    AXIS Compressed by the end of next year.\r\n\r\nThe Greek and Cyrillic are included
    in Japanese font, which is not for a body text but for a symbol like math and
    so on. So I guess it's hard to set a body text using the Greek and Cyrillic parts.
    Besides, the width of them are mono and 1000upms.\r\n\r\nYes, Nintendo Wii uses
    AXIS font in Japanese text but it is combined with Avenir in Latin part. And Apple
    store Japan also uses AXIS Fonts but of course, the Latin part is Myriad.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I'm going to attend Kobayashi's lecture today. \r\nI'm looking forward to hearing
    it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nKunihiko Okano"

    also designed Greek and Cyrillic characters of AXIS. But as you mentioned, I think
    it\u2019s hard to use the characters for body text.\r\n\r\nBy the way, [[http://images.multi-bits.com/index.jsp|multi-bits]]
    has used both latin characters and Japanese characters of AXIS. I told it to Okano-san
    last week.\r\n\r\nEnjoy Mr. Kobayashi\u2019s lecture!\r\n(I\u2019d want to join
    it...)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello Kunihiko:\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the information. Hope you enjoyed
    the lecture.\r\n\r\nI think AXIS is a real gem. I think, in addition to the full
    Japanese packages, a latin only version would definitely sell very well outside
    of Japan. Is there a possibility that a latin only version could be marketed?
    \ I can see many users adopting AXIS for general work and even corporate users
    strongly considering replacing Frutiger, Meta, or Myriad in favor of it.\r\n\r\nThere
    is some interest in it already.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/38424\r\n\r\nIt's
    a thought.\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Type Project has a plan to retail Latin only versions of AXIS. So now we've
    been designing Italics, Small caps, Old style figures and some ligatures. We've
    also got some requests about the Italics and Small caps from users. If you have
    any request about AXIS, let us know and refer to it.\r\nUnfortunately, we are
    tied up with a lot of high priority projects now, but we try to release Latin
    versions as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Akira Kobayashi's lecture. The
    lecture had three parts. The first was the Alphabet logotype critiques. Akira
    critiqued the logos which were designed by active young graphic designers. Akira
    exchanged ideas and opinions with each designer and refined the logo with every
    designer on stage. I was excited about hearing each person's opinion. Akira mentioned
    his opinion from type designer's point of view, on the other hand, every designer
    had a concept designing his/her logotype as a graphic designer.\r\nSecond, Akira
    showed his works such as Avenir Next, Palatino sans and explained what the appropriate
    letter form of geometric sans serif is. He compared the O of Avenir Next with
    a perfect circle form and explained the difference of the two forms.\r\nThe third
    part was the talk session with another two graphic designers.\r\nAnd at last,
    Akira answered the questions that the attendees asked him about the type, the
    letter forms and so on.\r\nThere were about three hundred peoples in the lecture
    room. It's hard to get a ticket of his lecture recently. I was lucky to join it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nKunihiko
    Okano"
