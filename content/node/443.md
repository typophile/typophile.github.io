  body: I haven&#39;t been able to find it either, Misa, but I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;s
    a font, not a custom job, so it must be out there somewhere.

  body: Wow, thanks Dave.  From the likes of you, I consider that an extreme compliment.  It
    was really just luck, I only know the free ones.

  body: <i>&#62; It was really just luck, I only know the free ones.</i> <BR> <BR>Lisa,
    it really doesn&#39;t matter that much how many samples  <BR>you identify. The
    important thing is that your knowledge  <BR>of free fonts is a valuable addition
    to the &#34;knowledge-mix&#34;  <BR>at work here, and perfectly complements the
    expertise  <BR>of the other IDers. This match and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6784.html?1046445733#POST13591"
    target="_blank"> both</a> <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10870.html?1054767783#POST19512"
    target="_blank"> others</a> illustrate  <BR>this eloquently. <BR> <BR>This reminds
    me of a remark by Christopher Purcell, who  <BR>also manages to dig up matches
    that we simply can&#39;t find.  <BR>This is how it works, and that&#39;s the sheer
    beauty of this <BR>message board.
