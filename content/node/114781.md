body: "I am doing a school project and I am illustrating deep sea creatures. I am
  going for a historic aesthetic. I found this text which is perfect from the \"Illustrated
  Catalogue of the Fishes of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia : G. Hassell & Son,
  1921\". \r\n\r\nHere is a link to the site with some sample pages of the book. https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_55506_illustratedcatalogueofthefishe1918\r\n\r\nI
  have also attached an image. I want to know what typeface is used for labeling the
  fish in the bottom right hand of this image. Any help would be awesome thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/imagesafdsas_3668.jpg]"

  body: "So small. About all I can say is that is an italic and seems to have contrast
    matching a \"modern\" typeface such as Scotch Roman, which is a font often used
    in British scientific books. There is a very good Scotch Modern by Nick Shinn
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/ If you find it too expensive
    for a school project there are others such as Scotch Roman MT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-scotch-roman/
    \r\nThere is a wiki that is very informative about the Scotch Roman/Modern typefaces
