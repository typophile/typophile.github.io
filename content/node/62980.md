  from thegridsystem.org  I didn't realize how temperamental it was going to be with
  me!\r\n\r\nThe documents, found here http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/templates/
  , are straightforward enough; they consist of grids and guidelines. The problem
  is applying that single page in the InDesign file to the entire document. If I create
  new pages, with some templates, nothing is replicated from the original. In other
  templates, only certain elements are replicated. For example: for the 6 column,
  8.5x11, the baseline and vertical column guides duplicate themselves, but the horizontal
  guides do not. \r\n\r\nWhat's up? Is there a step I'm missing in the application
  of templates? "

  body: I think you have to apply the templates and guides to the 'master' pages.
    Then when you make a new page, you can base it off of a master. You can control
    this stuff in the Pages palette. You may have to fiddle with the options and stuff
    (like make a guideline 'global') to get the guidelines to be visible on all of
    the pages.

  body: weinziet, the horizontal guides are still not being recognized. It's really
    rather strange.

  body: "Maybe it's a view setting, or a document compatibility issue. It's hard to
    say without looking at it in person.\r\n\r\nCouldn't you just re-create the horizontal
    guides?\r\n\r\n"
