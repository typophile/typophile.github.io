  Directory for my student theatre group. I'm currently art-directing a fellow student
  to come up with a poster for the show City of Angels (a 1940s musical about a novelist
  who is writing a screenplay. Half of the show is in black and white, and half is
  in color, done with set and lights.)\r\n\r\nThat said, we're looking for an font
  or typeface that will imitate the look and feel of the font used on the Dick Tracy
  comic books, as the art for the poster is in that style. \r\n\r\nI've attached the
  image below... could anyone help me to identify a font that would work? We can probably
  spend up to $50 to purchase a font if necessary. \r\n\r\nI've already done quite
  a bit of searching for comic book fonts, but I was hoping the experts here might
  be able to narrow down my search a little. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nETA:
  I've added a second image which is the one that I'm basing the poster on most. (Grould1947.jpg)"

      helping me. I''m not sure any of them are close enough to what I want though.
      I really need something like the headline font of the above picture and nothing
      I''ve found is quite blocky and expanded enough. '
