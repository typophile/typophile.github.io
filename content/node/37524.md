    isn't much of a preference for the type either, then. Have anything started to
    show us?"

  body: "Is the typeface you're selecting to be used in creating the logo, or in setting
    the text for the promotional material?\r\nI think that selecting a typeface and
    then designing the logo around it is going about things backwards. Logo design
    is more than just selecting an appropriate typeface for the event/client/occasion.
    A logo could contain illustration, photography or graphic symbols, and the design
    could be about the arrangement of these elements as much as about the elements
    themselves. \r\n\r\nI think a better design process is to think about some ideas
    for the logo, then select a typeface that works with your logo design ideas. \r\n\r\nSorry
    if that sounds like not much help, but sometimes it's better to just go back to
    scribbling in the sketchbook, then shackle yourself to your font menu.\r\n\r\nJason

    one festival. Interesting.\r\n\r\nIs there a possibility that there is a specific
    market the festival is aimed at? Teens, young adults, older adults, seniors? \r\n\r\nAny
    kind of theme for the event?"

    the word \"festival\" the other name i can't unfortunetly show just yet.\r\n\r\nIts
    a music festival that promotes talent in all genres of music. It's exciting, new,
    refreshing, live. \r\n\r\nThanks again."
