  poster of the Best Dutch Book Designs 2010 hanging in my room and I'm really bothered
  by the fact that I can't figure out what font is used on it. To me it looks like
  Helvetica, with a Neuzeit S 'i', a Univers-ish 'k'and numerals different from Helvetica.
  I know that the book was designed by Niels Schrader.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHere's the
  only image I could find on the internet of the book cover(which uses the same font)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cpnb-besteboeken2010-2011_6233.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  there's some pictures of the book here: http://www.nielsschrader.de/bvb1.html"
