body: "hi people,\r\n\r\ni am searching for a typesface or a combination of typefaces
  that, if well set, can communicate a premium experience. it's a bit difficult to
  explain, i am working on a wordmark for a premium brand in the real estate sector
  -\r\n\r\nthe design elements would be the brand itself + a corresponding travel
  destination (like toscana or bretagne, et cetera..). a two part wordmark basically
  -\r\n\r\nany suggestions would be great - currently i am working with a combination
  of something like bodoni/didot with trade/smth. comparable (but a face less classical
  and more contemporary (younger faces) would be interesting, too -\r\n\r\nany suggestion?
  time to write some down?\r\n\r\nbest + kind regards,\r\n\r\nsteffen :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    & Frere-Jones</a>. They are bursting with classy modern faces. Their website showcases
    them in a nice way as well that may help you see qualities in typefaces that may
    not be apparent at first.\r\n\r\nThere are others, of course, but H&F-J came to
    mind first (as they often do for me)."

  body: "Might I suggest <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/nicholas.html\">Nicholas,</a>
    Semibold or Bold, in capitals, for the destination?\r\nIt's a display face with
    the contrast and fine detail necessary to suggest the upscale, but enough personality
    for the individual destinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I second Chris' opinion, but would add DSType to the mix as well. I've used
    their Andrade Pro for some higher end cultural stuff, its a bit less formal than
    Didot/Bodoni, especially in regards to the Serifs which are a bit softer (esp.
    good for a display face)  it may sit well with a more modern humanist sans-serif
    (I used Priva for ex.)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andrade_5505.jpg]

  body: "hi again,\r\n\r\nthank you for the responses!\r\n\r\ni had a look at the
    luxury collection which i liked, thanks ken -\r\n\r\nalso had a look at nicholas,
    but what i really liked was 'scotch modern' -\r\n\r\nDSType features a lot of
    beautiful faces, and at relativly low costs, how the heck does dino de santos
    achieve that, i always wonder..\r\n\r\nthanks so far for all your help!\r\n\r\nbest,
    steffen -\r\n\r\n"
