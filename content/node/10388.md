body: Hi, <BR>I have visited Ascender Corp. site where one can buy Microsoft&#39;s
  fonts. Between Verdana, Georgia and Nina I found Gill Sans &#40;R&#41;. I thought
  it was Montotype&#39;s typeface. Am I right? Or not? <BR>I know that it&#39;s possible
  to buy it at Adobe, Monotype Imaging, Linotype and Ascender. The prices are different.
  And what about fonts. Are they different? <BR> <BR>artur

  body: Ascender has rights to various fonts that Microsoft has rights to sublicense
    &#40;not just the obvious Microsoft badged IP&#41;. The retail TTF&#39;s Ascender
    is offering are the latest shipping versions of these fonts. These may be important
    to people who need complete compatibility with the Office or Windows version of
    a given font.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si
