body: "I'd like to add ordinal capitals to my font, but I can't find where they are
  put in TypeTool 3's font table. They can either be set glyphs - ST, ND, RD, TH etc.
  or a full set of superscript letters - A to Z. I only need uppercase as my font
  is a titling face.\r\n\r\nI've tried all the default layouts. For the most of the
  work I've been using Adobe OT PS standard names (CFF) as I want to output to OpenType.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  it's not possible to add the ordinal caps in TypeTool which has basic OpenType table
  support. Can I not add custom glyphs?\r\n\r\nAnybody else come up against this,
  or overcome it in TypeTool?"

  body: "TypeTool doesn't allow to create new empty glyph slots, but it can be done
    using a little trick.\r\n\r\nCopy and then paste any existing glyph. TT will ask
    if you want to keep the replaced glyph. Do so, and the glyph will be added to
    the font, the glyph name being suffixed \".001\". Then rename the new glyphs as
    needed, in your example you would need d.ordn, h.ordn, n.ordn, r.ordn, s.ordn,
    t.ordn and/or their uppercase counterparts D.ordn &c.\r\n\r\nYou cannot write
    the OT feature code to switch to ordinals in TypeTool, but you could add the features
    using Adobe FDK later.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJens."

  body: "Good stuff! Thanks Jens. I've actually noticed that new slots get created
    this way having deleted a few erroneous ones that appeared at the end of the set.
    I didn't think they'd be what I needed for this. I'll try this later on today.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if there's a guide/resource for the correct glyph names anywhere? There
    are a few I might consider adding if I had a set of names.\r\n\r\nMark."

    .enc (Encoding) file in a plain-text editor (or make a new copy of that file first)
    and add the glyphnames you need. Restart TypeTool and the glyph slots will be
    available. \r\n\r\nYou can use the free Microsoft VOLT or Adobe FDK for OpenType
    tools to add OpenType Layout features to your font. \r\n\r\nThe FontLab Studio
    5 user manual (and I think also the TypeTool manual) contains a section on glyph
    naming and encoding. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nA.\r\n"
