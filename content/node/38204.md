  Freehand and Dreamweaver. I really don't need anything else nor have any strong
  ambition to fork over more money to Adobe.\r\n\r\nNot that I won't...eventually.
  FH is on its death bed, afterall.\r\n\r\nBut, in the interim, I still would like
  to be able to set Open Type fonts once in a while. Usually for working on a logo
  or graphic for a web site, so no need for InDesign.\r\n\r\nAs such, what are my
  DTP/Vector illustration apps that support OpenType options? Ideally for OSX. Any
  Open Source options? Or is it pretty much InDesign + Illustrator?"

    many OT features are supported, but the basics should be there afaics.

    OpenType but doesn't quite yet.

    have wiggle room in my personal budget for buying top-end software, but I do have

    though, merely an amateur with typophilic interests. So for me, this sort of topic
    is quite interesting.'

  body: "Just as an update on Scribus' support for OpenType: I have a copy of v1.3.3.8
    for Windows, and on this version the answer is that it's happy to <em>use</em>
    OpenType fonts, and it has a glyph palette for accessing all characters, as well
    as a menu item for inserting standard ligs, BUT it doesn't seem to apply OT features:
    ligatures aren't substituted automatically; if you apply small caps, superscript
    etc it just scales the regular characters like Word would; and there aren't any
    tools/options specifically about applying OT features.\r\n\r\nJust so ya know.
    If anyone knows that <em>other</em> versions of Scribus behave differently, pipe
    up, of course!\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\nEver since
    I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."

    hope not. Its cross platform functionality is something really needed in the professional
    forum. \r\n\r\nHowever it may not become dominant in the home and office markets,
    where the need is less dire."

    necessarily, but Adobe so dominates the desktop publishing market that I\u2019m
    not sure why many other companies would be in any hurry to support Opentype features.
    Designers are mostly using Indesign, and non-designers don\u2019t really care.
    It makes sense for the open-source software crowd to support it, but they have
    pretty limited programming resources."
