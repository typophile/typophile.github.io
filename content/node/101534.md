body: "One of the hardest parts of font production for me has always been testing
  and quality assurance. So I am trying to establish a formal process that will at
  least cover all the major bases. I know I want to check outlines, integrity of the
  font file tables, metrics and kerning, and OpenType feature functionality.\r\n\r\nI
  am curious what others do -- strategies, processes, tools, etc. Anyone willing to
  share?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-t."

  body: One option is to use [[http://www.fontqa.com|fontQA]]. I must admit that I've
    thought of developing my own QA checker as at some stage I will need to do a formal
    release process.

  body: "You need multiple tools to test fonts. Unfortunately, you also need to develop
    a lot of expertise in reading the output, as each of the font testing tools has
    been developed to meet the needs of the particular company that made it.\r\n\r\nThe
    Adobe CompareFamily tool from the AFDKO is indispensable, and one of very few
    tools that checks how various metadata is coordinated across a family, as well
    as performing a variety of single-font level tests.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's Font Validator
    can be useful, especially for TTF.\r\n\r\nComing up with some way to run fonts
    against the Windows version of the OpenType Sanitizer used by WebKit is handy,
    if you are going to release web font versions of your fonts. We had to do a bunch
    of work to wire it up, though."

  body: I use Font Validator as the primary QA tool. However, you need to be aware
    of which aspects of it have not yet been updated to cover the latest version of
    the OT spec. These will report as problems things that are fine according to the
    latest spec, e.g. new table version values and data.

  body: "Thanks for the input, folks. I also have used Font Validator for a long time,
    and I recently added the fontQA suite to my toolbox. Sounds like I may have to
    look into the OpenType Sanitizer as well.\r\n\r\n-tim\r\n"

    there\u2019s a Web version at http://async5.org/ots/ots.html. Base64 representation
    of the font binary needed."
