		<div class="commentbody">I have, under duress, included the interrobang in a family of fonts (Constantia) because the client requested it. My approach to the design was, I believe, novel, but basically this symbol is utter crap: it was poorly thought out, and it is basically impossible to design an interrobang that does not turn into a dark blot at small sizes. The construction of the symbol is illogical and counter to the organic evolution of written forms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The interrobang is not essential to rhetorical questions'. It is a grammatically nonsensical mark, of possible interest only to someone who doesn't know the difference between a question and an exclamation. A rhetorical question is still a question, and should be terminated with a question mark. An exclamation is a statement that begins with an interrogative (typically what or how) but does not take the form of a question. The interrobang? How foolish!</div>

The interrobang, combining exclamation and question marks, was originated in 1962 by Martin K. Speckter, New York advertising executive and printing hobbyist. It was incorporated into all versions of Americana (ATF calling it 'interabang'), but although it got considerable response at the time, it was not included in other type families.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Americana Bold was the last new typeface produced by ATF.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, can you post some images of Christian's interrobangs? I have not been able to navigate to any image of them via the fontshop links. Amplitude is a pretty wide and open design anyway, so I can see that in such a context it might be easier to produce an interrobang that looks reasonable and doesn't black up. In a typical text face, it is much more difficult. This is what I did, under protest, for Constantia, thereby lowering the standard of an otherwise pretty good typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My main objection to the interrobang isn't its ungainly form, but its grammatical nonsense. It is a 'punctuation mark' for people who don't know how to correctly punctuate. It is entirely telling that the English language persisted for hundreds of years without the need for such a sign, until some advertising executive &ndash; a breed not known for their finely honed grammar &ndash; came up with the idea. Meanwhile, professional copy editors continue to correct misuse of question mark and exclamation mark, because they know the difference between a question and an exclamation.</div>

Yes, it is useful to people who do not express themselves grammatically. But then so is <!-- raw HTML omitted --> , and I don't consider that punctuation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm afraid there is simply no argument to be made for the interrobang being grammatically useful, because grammar distinguishes a question from an exclamation and assigns a specific, individual punctuation mark to each. There is no ambiguous case in which one cannot determine whether something is a question or an exclamation. Most things that are concluded ?! are in fact questions, and should be concluded ?.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what does ?! represent? What indeed! It might be the raised eyebrows when we question something we can scarcely believe. Or it might be the tone of indignation when we question what seems to us wrong. But neither of these are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grammatical.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They belong to a level of textual articulation above the grammatical. So, yes, one can say that the interrobang might be ungrammatically useful, or even extra-grammatically useful. But this is an argument against the notion of the interrobang as a new (and proudly American) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punctuation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mark. It may look like a punctuation mark, it may have hijacked two punctuation marks, but it functions as something other than and beyond a punctuation mark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The interrobang itself is a symptom of ungrammatical usage of the exclamation mark, especially beloved of ad-men like Martin Speckter, to express loudness. You know: loudness! Since, according to this usage, the exclamation mark can be added to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> statement, regardless of whether it is grammatically an exclamation or not, it is assumed that it can be added to what is grammatically a question. Correct use of the exclamation mark is one of the least taught aspects of English grammar, even more poorly understood by most people than the semi-colon and apostrophe.</div>

Grammar does not need an exclamation mark to distinguish a 'plain statement from an exclaimed statement'; it uses an exclamation mark to clearly distinguish an exclamation from a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->question<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the most common form of exclamation begins with an interrogative): 'How lovely!' as distinct from 'How lovely?'</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Grammar is the system by which a language operates. The system is extensible, but if something is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contrary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to what is already established in the system, it is unlikely to catch on. So people have been asking for years 'Why hasn't the interrobang caught on?' And I'm answering: because it is contrary to our system of grammar, which makes a clear distinction between a question and an exclamation. Language is complex, but it is anything but arbitrary: it is the strongest evidence we have of the intensely structured nature of the human brain. Yes, languages develop, but they develop along specific lines. Capricious inventions by advertising executives are ever unlikely to catch on. The really remarkable thing about the interrobang is not that it didn't catch on &ndash; that should have been predictable &ndash;, but that all these years later people are still asking why it didn't catch on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Changes in pronunciation &ndash; which may be based on error or confusion, as in your 'expresso' example &ndash; have nothing to do with grammar. Pronunciation is conventional and essentially arbitrary. Grammar is systematic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is a more precise analogy. Millions of people use semicolons incorrectly; this does not mean that we are developing new usages for the semi-colon. There is one grammatical construction &ndash; one grammatical circumstance &ndash; in which we need a punctuation mark that does what the semicolon does. Any other use of the semicolon is simply pointless: a use of the mark where a different mark is appropriate. The same is true of the interrobang. In every situation where one might be tempted to use an interrobang, there is another mark &ndash; usually a question mark &ndash; that is intended to be used in that circumstance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Does grammar affect our ability to successfully communicate our thoughts? Can we think ?! without having a symbol (or multiple symbols combined) to express it? The Whorfian Hypothesis suggests that language shapes our understanding of the world. If we don't have language to describe an emotion or a state of being, then that emotion or state of being doesn't exist. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whoa&hellip;my head hurts&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the use of the semi-colon (or lack of it) has to do with grammar education (or lack of it), then access to the interrobang (or lack of it) also limits the possibility of its use. Is it possible that the semicolon is no longer being taught simply because it holds less and less of an important function in our language? I'd argue that language and grammar work in a social/politcal-darwinian sense. What sticks around (and who decides to keep it around) remains functionable; what develops is based on the needs (and those that hold the power) of the language.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We can compare the interrobang to the evolution of the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the emo-cons.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We can compare the interrobang to the evolution of the :-) or the :-(, the emo-cons.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indeed. That is exactly what we can compare it to. I believe the interrobang <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what we would now call an emoticon (I'm not familiar with the variant emo-con). That is, it is an extra-grammatical sign that provides a cue to emotive articulation of text. This is exactly the point I made earlier when I acknowledged that there is an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ungrammatical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> use for the interrobang. What I object to is the oft-repeated statement that the interrobang is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punctuation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mark. It seems to me that this is an assumption based solely on the fact that it looks like a punctuation mark, rather than on any attempt to analyse the use of the mark. Punctuation marks are a class of signs that correspond to the division of utterances into phrases and into classes (statement, question, exclamation, etc.) that are products of syntax and morphology. This division is grammar, and it is something that happens at a much lower level of language than emotive articulation. Some punctuation marks, especially the question mark, are particularly useful because of our habit of abbreviation, which can make syntactical constructions ambiguous. So, for example, if someone tells us 'Dinner will be ready soon' we might abbreviate the question 'How soon will dinner be ready?' to simply 'How soon?' In this case, the syntax of the utterance 'How soon' doesn't clearly indicate that this is a question, so the punctuation mark which performs only a supporting role to the full construction 'How soon will dinner be ready' becomes essential to understanding. This is the sort of thing that punctuation marks do. They do not signal emotional articulation. They belong to a different class of signs from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> etc.. So I maintain that the interrobang is not a punctuation mark and has no grammatical function, because its purpose is to articulate something extra-grammatical, e.g. questioning suprise or disbelief. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it is very telling that of all the many writing systems in the world, none have developed a primary system of emotive articulation, while almost all have developed or adopted some level of punctuation (beginning with a space or marker to separate words or, in the case of written languages like Thai and Burmese, phrases). But there are many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->secondary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> systems of emotive articulation, which are not grammatical but are used by specific communities as a layer on top of grammar. The point about specific communities is very important in this regard because, while all symbols are conventional, punctuation marks correspond to describable aspects of the structure of language, while things like emoticons correspond to extra-linguistic, social conventions and are often identifiers of specific groups or 'tribes'. The systems of secondary articulation of writing employed by Japanese schoolgirls are only partly intuitively understandable by readers outside that community. The system of emoticons employed on Typophile and many other forums, along with their plain text equivalents, are understood by a much larger and more international community, but this does not make them primary signs of any written language. They remain a level above grammar. They are also much more subject to fashion than punctuation, since they are primarily used in ephemeral utterances, while more formal written language is intended to communicate not only among a members of a particular community at a particular time, but between writers and readers from different communities living hundreds of years apart from each other. Secondary systems seldom last that long, while punctuation tends to evolve only very slowly and, once a language has developed a consistent system that works, it is more likely to solidify than to change. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An interesting case of secondary articulation is the non-vowel markings of the Hebrew Bible. Some of these secondary marks &ndash; accent or cantillation marks &ndash; have continued to be understood, or at least systematically interpreted within specific communities, for many centuries because of their musical significance. But there are some secondary marks in ancient Hebrew manuscripts, the puncta extraordinaria for instance, whose original meaning is lost and which we can only guess at. Hundreds of years from now, scholars might look at the handwritten notes of Japanese schoolgirls from the early years of the 21st century and ponder what the little hearts and cat faces meant to that community. The same researchers will be able to determine what the punctuation marks in the documents mean by analysing the structures of the language and how these marks relate to them. This is the difference between primary (grammatical) and secondary (extra-grammatical) notation of language: the former is tied to the structures of language, while the latter applied like a layer and can be easily disassociated. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what is the interrobang? It looks like a primary mark, because it references the form of two primary marks. But one of those two marks, the exclamation mark, is itself used by many people as an emotive articulation sign! (as I just did there, for emphasis, even though grammatically that was not an exclamation). Indeed, this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->secondary use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the exclamation mark is much more common today than its primary use as a punctuation mark properly understood. So the interrobang hijacks this secondary, emotive articulating use of the exclamation mark and marries it to the question mark, which is still primarily a punctuation mark and only seldom used in a secondary way (usually in isolation, as a kind of abbreviation). So it is neither one thing nor the other, but relies for what functionality it does have on a secondary use of the exclamation mark, and there seems to be general agreement throughout this thread that it is used to express something about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a question is asked, which indicates to me that it is a kind of emoticon. Typically for a secondary mark, it has been subject to fashion. It was briefly in fashion in the 1970s, and one could pay to have one's typewriter modified to include it. It may come back into fashion. But it will never be a punctuation mark because there is no grammatical construct with which it is associated, which is the defining characteristic of all other punctuation marks. It tells us something extra-grammatical about an utterance, but even this is doesn't seem to do very clearly or well, especially if you care about a distinction between ?! and !? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
