    if the x-heights in a sans and serif system are the same, one or the\r\nother
    will (generally) not work optimally. Yup, you heard me right guys.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    then. ITC Garamond has a closer x-height with Akzidenz and larger counters...etc.
    (could go into more detail) ...\r\n\r\nJ P H"

  body: "Jaz,\r\n\r\nWhat do you want? Do you want the typefaces to seem sympathetic,
    related? Or do you just have AG and Stempel Garamond and you want to use them?
    \r\n\r\nMy opinion is they do not play well together, don't use them together.
    AG goes better with Century Schoolbook, Clarendon, Bodoni. Stempel Garamond goes
    with Syntax, Bliss, Mundo, Cronos, etc. \r\n\r\nITC Garamond goes with Avant Garde. "

    looking for.\r\nExcellent. You're a genius. Well, you've got your research down
    at least.\r\nok thanks again, yeah, I really like stempel, but AG was used with
    ITC Garamond in this example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img0032_4162.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to look into the others you suggested.\r\nOkay, take it easy,\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nJaz"
