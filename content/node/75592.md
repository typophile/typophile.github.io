  that this is the right place. I'm a graphic designer and I'm looking for places
  on the Internet where I can discuss optimal work flows with choosing and using fonts
  and the technical aspects as well.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate your help."

  body: "Read the posts in the General forum -- they tend to only touch the fringes
    of Typophilia and may actually wander off into any direction.\r\n\r\nThe Build
    forum is intended for the highly technical aspects of font building.\r\n\r\nThe
    Design forum is for 'general' design (but not <em>every</em> design; it's still
    related mainly to the typography); the Critique forum is where one would throw
    a freshly-created typeface to the wolves :-)"

  body: "You might want to change your user name, though. G-Type is the name of a
    type foundry run by Nick Cooke, so using that name is liable to confuse people
    (at best) and perhaps even run you into more negative accusations. Not that I'm
    trying to suggest you are doing anything improper; I understand G is also your
    first initial.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
