body: I'm working on redesigning a publication that currently goes out to an older
  demographic (40-60). The overall style of the publication is sophisticated, clean
  and classy. A cross between "Real Simple" and "Esquire". The current body copy is
  Cheltenham Light set at 9.3 over 12. Given our demographic (older professional women)
  and attempt to attract a slightly younger demo I would like to come up with something
  new that is easier to read, a bit more modern and hopefully won't cut down our word
  count. Any ideas?

    all the mistakes that are required to become an expert. However, I would like
    to state my thoughts in the hope that they get shot down by forum gurus, who will
    then teach me more neat tricks :)\r\n\r\nConsequently:\r\n\r\nTo make Cheltenham
    Light appear younger and modernised without compromising the other qualities,
    I might plump for [[http://www.linotype.com/49242/rotissemiserif-family.html|Rotis
    Semi Serif]].\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you. I'm leaning towards Garamond Premier Pro Regular or Caecilia Light.
    I like Caecilia for departmental pages and maybe reserve the Garamond for feature
    body copy. \r\n\r\nI will try Poynter and see what that looks like. Any other
    suggestions?"
