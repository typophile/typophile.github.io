  body: i thought it was all one face, so when chesh said the bold was windsor it
    threw me for a loop, but it very well could be. <BR>Maybe it&#39;s not badly drawn,
    maybe i just did a bad scan job. At any rate here&#39;s another sample. Oh, btw,
    these are from the Scissor Sisters album artwork. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47573.gif"

  body: The idea that someone might still be using film type setting may not be that
    far-fetched. It&#39;s still not a bad application for short headlines. However,
    I agree it seems like the sort of thing SOMEONE would have digitized. The big
    problem is that very likely the name was changed. Jim Parkinson has a Sans Serif
    font called Richmond, and so does Linotype, although theirs is a Blackletter style.
    I only found one reference to Richmond Old Style and it was a reference to seeing
    it used for TV show titles. &#40;perhaps more evidence that a font exists?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Maybe someone out there knows how much photocomposition is still being
    done?

  body: Ignacio you found it! Wembley  is identical to Richmond Old Style. It was
    one of the Headliners fonts that Treacyfaces acquired in the early 90&#39;s, and
    my supposition is that Headliners renamed it when they digitized it.
