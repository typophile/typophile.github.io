body: "I am making an display font for a studio to use in-house on a very short run
  of signs. \r\nThe font is a basic sans serif with a decorative inline.\r\nIt will
  be caps, numbers and basic punctuation only.\r\n\r\nHowever, there will be several
  alternatives to most of the characters in the alphabet, 4 /K/s for example, 6 /B/s,
  only 1 /O/, and so on. In fact there won't really be a definitive version of each
  character, only different iterations. The overall shape of each character will remain
  the same and the variation between them only affects the inline element - changes
  to the blackness of each glyph will be negligible so I am going to use the same
  side bearings and kerning throughout. \r\n\r\nThe question is how and where to place
  all the alternates in a font. I want them to be as accessible to the studio as possible
  but without going overboard with the solution as the use of the font will be so
  limited. A neat enough work around is all that is needed for this problem I think.
  The studio suggested accessing the glyphs via the glyph palette in InDesign so they
  are not concerned about typing as such, rather selecting alternatives to fashion
  words in favourable combinations. I think this is fine for the extent of the font's
  use, still, I'd like this process to be as neat for them as possible.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts? Simple and neat solutions for a graphic designer acting in his best capacity
  as a type designer to aid workflow in-house.\r\nMany thanks."

  body: "Ideally, you could build a font with alternates immediately following the
    basic forms, and that's the way they would display in the Glyph Palette. Unfortunately,
    neither FontLab nor InDesign lives in that ideal world. Ideally, in Index mode
    FontLab would allow you to select a range of characters--your regular characters
    and alternates--then sort by name, so that B would be followed by Ba.t1, B.alt2
    and so on, but...FontLab doesn't allow selective sorting: it's all or nothing.
    Plus, even if FontLab accommodated you, ID (at least CS3) doesn't allow you to
    select Glyph Index as a viewing mode in the palette, so you're screwed coming
    and going.\r\n\r\nSo, your best bet is to select the Latin 1252 codepage, then
    put your alternates, in alphabetical order, in the \"unused\" glyph slots, probably
    quote base single, florin, quote base double, ellipsis, and so on. At least, then,
    the alternate glyphs would appear in alphabetical order for easier selection."

  body: "Thanks chaps.\r\n\r\nNick, I was looking around in the codepage menu - FreeFont
    places all the characters with diacritics etc. next to each other - this might
    cover the number of alternatives for each character, and maybe make them type-able
    at the other end. I might play around with this rather than the Latin 1252. I
    guess either way it comes out in the same order in the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nComing
    to type design from a graphic design and aesthetic background I feel quite out
    of my depth with this kind of thing. Feel free to put me back on a path to righteousness."

  body: "There is a solution but it needs a little programming (Or you might use \"microsoft
    VOLT\" which doesn't need programming). There is a feature in opentype called
    \"stylistic alternatives\", if you add it to your font ,you'll get something more
    convenient in glyph window of illustrator (or Indesign), there is a good example
    of this feature in \"zapfino Lt\" font which each glyph has many alternates, In
    illustaror if you choose any letter, in the glyph window you'll get alternate
    glyphs, of course you should enable the \"stylistic alternatives\" button in the
    opentype panel.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i52.tinypic.com/29ff493.png\">\r\nand
    something unrelated to the subject! Why insert image doesn't work with Firefox
    or opera? Every time I have to upload image on other servers. I think you have
    to do something for mac users. Or there is a workaround?"

  body: "I would put the alternates in separate Stylistic Sets, and instruct your
    client to set their headings six times, stacked, and apply a different Stylistic
    Set to each line.\r\n\r\nImmediately, they would get to compare six different
    looks (you could group alternates in each Set to harmonize).\r\n\r\nThen they
    could manually select, copy and paste individual characters from line to line,
    till they get the optimal setting. "

  body: Thanks again, bahman and Nick. I knew this was possible to explore the glyphs
    in this manner in Adobe suite (that is probably sufficient for the client) but
    how to program this at the FontLab end? Any advice? Thank you.

  body: "The advantage the Stylistic Sets method has over six separate fonts is that
    it's possible to include kerning for all the alternates with one another.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if it's just for display work, the client could manually kern or use \"optical\"
    kerning.\r\n\r\nSo why not just make six fonts?\r\nIt's actually easier for the
    end user, because the Stylistic Sets feature is buried several layers down in
    the GUI, whereas font selection is up front."
