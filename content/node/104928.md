  for figuring out how to create my font.  So thank you all for that! I have one question
  that I was hoping you lovely type designers might be able to help me with. I'm creating
  an all uppercase font with programed faux randomization, with 3 glyphs per character.
  I've spent the longest time figuring out how to get that to work, and it's finally
  running smoothly. Now, after all that work I don't know what to do with the lowercase
  characters!  For now they're empty,  Is there anyway to just scrap the lowercase
  glyphs? I really don't need them. Or if I copy the character, metrics, and kerning
  of my \"default\" glyphs to the lowercase, how do I also program all the contextual
  alternates to follow it? If I program a=A will it then abide by the programming
  of that uppercase \"A?\"  As it stands, I have to hold down shift or press caps
  lock to use my font.  Thanks in advance for your help! \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    body: "Thank you for the suggestion. I read through the post you referenced, I'm
      assuming Double encoding worked for you? There seemed to be some question if
      that would create problems. Also, would this work only if the user has checked
      the opentype options? For instance, if they're using it in indesign and haven't
      checked on the opentype features, would the lowercase just be blank? \r\nCheers!\r\n"

    mentioned in that thread.\r\n\r\nThere's no blank lowercase when using the font,
    because whatever has been typed or pasted gets directed via the unicode to the
    capital letters. That's all prior to any OpenType stuff happening."

    body: I went ahead a tried this out, and so far it's working beautifully! Thank
      you for your help! I found a few comments you left on other threads that were
      also very useful. For other folks that might be interested, the other thread
