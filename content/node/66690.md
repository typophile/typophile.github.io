  any and all information on typefaces that may have been used in, or are inspired
  by typefaces used in America in the mid 19th Century. Typefaces that may have been
  used in conjunction with silhouette portraits or as stamped artists logos or signatures
  would be great too! \r\n\r\nIf you don't know what I mean by silhouette portraits
  this may jog your memory: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jennys_5163.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: If you mean the mid 1700s, they would have been imported from Europe, so besides
    Caslon, the Scotch Romans.

  body: I've come across a 1984 reprint of a 1894 Sears, Roebuck, and Co.  catalog.
    Lots of interesting type in there that I have yet to identify. It's a later period
    than you're asking for but some amount of that type had to have been in use earlier.
    I'll try to post some scans later.
