  this cover from Dec. '06 of Wired Magazine...\r\n\r\n(see attachment)\r\n\r\nIt's
  very similiar to Arame from dmtr.org\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dimitrelima/0arame/\r\n\r\nand
  sort of similiar to Identikal's Kneeon\r\nhttp://www.faces.co.uk/fonts/Identikal/Kneeon-Square-IDK0080/\r\n\r\nBut
  has a few more weights...\r\n\r\nYour help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.-C."
