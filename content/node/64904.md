  old specimen books, from ATF and others, are now available on the Web.\r\n\r\nI
  recently noted a typeface in one old ATF specimen book, called \"Washington\", that
  was immediately recognizable. (It didn't stick around much in later editions of
  their specimen book, however, although one other one had a light weight of that
  typeface. The different weights had different names.)\r\n\r\nI finally found this
  page\r\n\r\nhttp://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=634\r\n\r\nwhich discusses the different
  names under which this font was kept alive: a digital version now exists under the
  name Mephisto.\r\n\r\nApparently, the version Ace Books used for their small-format
  pocket book editions of the Venus and Pellucidar books by Burroughs (as well as
  other related books) was called Alexandra, and provided by a small company called
  Photo-Lettering, according to that article."

    and Lafayette are the names given to more condensed versions of the face.
