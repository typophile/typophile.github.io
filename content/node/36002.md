body: I'm pretty sure I've seen this before, but I can't remember the tool. Is there
  a way to make a letter bolder? If so, is there a way to do it where it isn't just
  a simple stroke around the edge of the entire letter? Thanks.

  body: Thanks oldnick. It's actually Tools > Action > Effects > Make Bold. I've used
    it before, but forgot to look in Action because there isn't a triangle to indicate
    more options underneath.
