  got to recreate this horrible logo and can't figure out which font (or fonts) were
  used to create it.  I've spent hours on this to no avail.  Sigh.  Can anyone out

  body: That is indeed unsightly. It's not the fault of the typeface - <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/'
    target='_blank'>Peignot</a>, however. Note that the leading S and E are capitals
    and the rest lowercase.

  body: I am also convinced that stroking letters is generally a bad idea. Just adds
    confusion to what type designer did.
