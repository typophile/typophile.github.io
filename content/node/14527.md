    look close, maybe there's an alternate set.\r\n\r\nHas a Spiekerman look to it."

  body: "I took a step back from my attempt to answer in the first place, since I
    do not have a definite answer, nor a relevant one. Now I feel I should do so.
    \r\n\r\nI did an identity a while ago for one of my customers for a cobranding
    initiative \"canon professional center\" - a sort of one stop print shop featuring
    exclusively canon equipment. As I exchanged mails with canon brand manager for
    Romania, I mention what had been on my mind for a while at the time, the typeface
    issue. The answer I got at the time was that they were using a \"customised\"
    typeface, however loose that answer might have been.\r\n\r\nThe samples provided
    as reference are way too small to be of any efficient help, but if you check any
    of the <a href=\"http://www.brochures.canon-europe.com/getFile.php?productid=8071&languageid=1\">downloadable
    PDF brochures </a> they provide on the site, you'll get a mention of the contained
    typefaces, and the only one who stands out is \"DendaNew\". The italics are awfully
    close to those of JFPorchez's LeMonde Sans Italic, and the upright versions have
    a feel of Formata and Stella, but if I were to guess, judging by the overall look
    and feel, I would credit either Mario Feliciano (Stella) or Michael Abbink (Kievit)
    with the typeface, with a slight prefference for the latter, given his involvment
    in identity programmes."
