body: "In <em>The Modification of Letter Forms</em> Stanley Hess wrote:\r\n\r\n\"The
  horizontal line of some letters creates a lateral axis, causing these letters to
  appear inordinately wide. This is most apparent when there is not only a juncture
  at mid-point, but the letter contains horizontal elements as well. In order to restore
  stable proportions, such letters (B,E,F,P,R,S,a,e,s,2,3,5,6,8,9) need to be optically
  condensed.\" \r\n\r\nHess goes on to give other optical principles, including this
  one:\r\n\r\n\"Top units of letters with stacked shapes are contracted 1/20th the
  module in relation to lower units on either or both sides of the letter.\" \r\n\r\nIn
  [[http://typophile.com/node/44037|another thread]] I referred to these optical principles--without
  citing the source--and also argued that the narrowing of stacked letters generally
  serves to maintain even color in words. \r\n\r\nIn arguing about how narrowing helps
  even color I was following ideas from David Kindersley, as well as testing things
  with my own eyes. According to Kindersley, the total advance width of a character
  is affected by the total amount of black in the letter. However, this total is a
  weighted sum, with the black at the left and right extremes counting for more than
  the black in the middle. \r\n\r\nKindersley's theory has complex implications, but
  it does mean that the dividing black strokes tend to push the ideal side bearings
  out wider. This need for wider side bearings may contradict the need for visually
  even spaces between letters. Thus in order to achieve both even color and even spacing,
  narrowing stacked letters helps. It reduces the need for wider side bearings, and
  hence brings the color and spacing into line with non-stacked letters.  \r\n\r\nNow
  this narrowing is not an absolute rule, as thinning some of the horizontal stokes
  will affect how wide you can go, and weight on the ends of strokes will also affect
  things. Thus for example the wide S (compared to Classical forms) in  Bodoni and
  other \"Modern\" or \"Romantic\" (Bringhurst) faces, has thinner horizontal arches,
  and the thinness is maintained further toward the double curved diagonal stroke.
  \"Moderno,\" currently the display type here, is an example.\r\n\r\nIn that thread
  Eben responded:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry but I think the idea that an a (or s) has to
  be narrow to make it look even on the page is silly. It\u2019s an optical question
  not a question of tradition or anything else.\r\n\r\n\"Carl\u2019s point about this
  [typeface under discussion] being designed with display in mind is a more important
  point even than mine. A great text face with great even color wouldn\u2019t work
  well in this context. It would be far too dull.\"\r\n\r\nEben, I didn't say that
  the narrowing of divided letters was \"a question of tradition\". I pointed out
  that traditionally admired letter designs *reflect* this optical principle pretty
  consistently.  To me this lends weight to its being a correct principle. The fact
  that eg the higher contrast S goes together with a wider S in much-admired designs
  to me confirms that Hess and Kindersley are on to something real, even though they
  only have part of the story.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a designer is not at liberty
  to push individual letter forms every which way, and have the typeface not suffer
  in terms of optical balance of individual letters, and evenness in color in word
  forms. You can mess with one letter, but then what you do in one is going to have
  to be harmonized in all the other letters. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I think your
  implication that evenness of color is \"dull\" is a fundamental misunderstanding
  of good type. Type is still type, not lettering, and it needs to be able to set
  words at will, not find a design that suits one or two words, as lettering can do.
  Great display type--which is where I put Bodoni and Didot--can have even color,
  and is the better for it when it does. \r\n\r\nText type needs other qualities in
  addition to even color, qualities that make it work at small sizes. But great display
  type also needs even color, in my opinion. "

    it sounds to me like you are using that truth as a reason to dismiss study and
    discussion of theory as useless. And I think that is a mistake. \r\n\r\nBecause
    there are still the questions \"looks right to whom; and how right is it?\" \r\n\r\nTo
    me, it's something like cooking. A person who doesn't know a cuisine, say Chinese
    cuisine, experiencing it infrequently may be blown away by some dish. But a person
    who eats that cuisine regularly, and knows the best, will know that same dish
    can be way better. And an expert chef will be able to tell you exactly how to
    make it better. \r\n\r\nThe experience eating good food is like experience using
    and drawing type. How to fix it is where theory comes in. A chef will learn all
    kinds of tricks to make dishes better, while educating his or her palate at the
    same time. The tricks are theory, so to speak. They're no substitute for the gifted
    and experienced eye--or gifted and experienced palate in my analogy--but the theory
    teaches you the right questions to ask, and some things to do to that will on
    occasion improve your dishes, or type designs. \r\n\r\nAt least that's my working
    hypothesis, and why I read this stuff like Hess and Kindersley. \r\n\r\nBy the
    way, have you read Doyald Young's \"Fonts and Logos\"?"

    \r\n\r\nEdit: I forgot how confusing Kindersley's stuff is. It took me reading
    his book, and an interminable thread on Typophile before I understood it. \r\n\r\n>Do
    you think that those whose types you admire have a theory, or do they run on instinct?\r\n\r\nI
    don't think it's either-or. I think type designers have a few conscious ideas
    they could articulate on what they want to do, and then most of the rest of it
    is their eye telling them what works in executing the idea. The idea may have
    some theory about perception or readability in it, or it may be purely aesthetic.
    \r\n\r\nFor most of the old timers, we don't know what they were thinking. Dwiggins
    had his \"M theory\" about how angles at small sizes turn into curves, and that
    inspired some of his work. "

  body: I've just been revisiting Hess's book, and I can't find the passage you quote
    at the top of the page. In any case, looking at it now after it has sat on my
    shelf for a fair number of years, it seems to me that Hess is a bit long on theory
    and short on results. His type designs are rather dull and flat-footed for all
    their technical and optical correctness. I don't necessarily think his theories
    are invalid, but he seems to be over-thinking things a bit. I still think the
    book is valuable, but I would take his theories with a grain of salt. (Of course,
    you may want to take my opinion with a grain of salt. In my world, intuition usually
    trumps theory when they conflict. ;-)

    clash with one another, so their practical consequences are often not clear. \r\n\r\nBecause
    of all the real complexity, intuition should in general trump theory. It is only
    when theory is rock solid, as in some parts of science, that it can go the other
    way around. Certainly not in type design. \r\n\r\nI find Hess's book valuable
    in raising questions to ask about a design in process. But it is the eyes that
    have to give the answer, not the theory. "

  body: I have the 1981 revised edition. It has the second passage you quoted, but
    not the first (at least I haven't found it, and it's not on p. 24). Maybe he had
    second thoughts about the "divided letters" problem? The second passage seems
    to be the standard rule about making the top part of a letter a bit narrower than
    the bottom (e.g., B, S, 8, etc.). This has more to do with making the forms look
    balanced, but it does affect and is affected by spacing, although not much.

    genre of typeface.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spooling_6194.png]\r\nThe
    spacing of Richler was informed by faces such as DIN and News Gothic Condensed,
    the idea being that if the round side strokes of letters are upright and the letters
    squarish, then those strokes should be spaced more like straight vertical strokes.
    It looks a bit strange at display size, or when closely inspected, but in text
    works fine, and the \"breathing room\" between adjacent rounds--as in the \"p-o\"
    combination--is arguably preferable to the near-collision one gets in old-style
    faces. This kind of face does need an open fit (wide serifs).\r\n\r\nRichler would
    benefit from a different set of metrics for display use, something more along

    says that in the H the cross bar visually draws the stems together, reducing how
    wide the side bearings need to be. So Tracy thinks the effect of the cross bar
