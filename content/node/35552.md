  T-D lists, long before Typophile became the preferred internet forum for typographic
  discussion.\r\n\r\nI disappeared several years ago. What happened was this huge
  slab serif fell on my head and I was in a comma for several years. When I finally
  came to, my memory was intact, except for all things related to typography, which
  I completely forgot.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recently learned that TypeCon would be happening
  this year in Seattle. (The last TypeCon I had attended was the first one.)\r\n\r\nSuddenly
  it all came rushing back to me.\r\n\r\nTypography...of course! So that's why I have
  so much trouble reading poorly typeset pages! And all those boxes of weird booklets
  -- those are type specimens! And the portrait in the altar of my living room --
  that must be Bram de Does! \r\n\r\nAnyway, since I live near Seattle, I figured
  I would attend TypeCon and try to reacquaint myself with the typographic scene.\r\n\r\nI
  recognize a lot of personalities on these forums, and I hope to see many of you
  at TypeCon!\r\n\r\n-Phan Nguyen"
