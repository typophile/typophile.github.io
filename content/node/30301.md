  body: "It's probably a hardwired 'font' built into your fax machine that is not
    something you can use on a personal computer. However, there are some fonts that
    simulate this look. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/80s-pxl/bold/\">80's
    Pxl</a> from Baseline Fonts is the closest I found searching with 'matrix' (as
    in dot-matrix).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    you could. But you might want to check if someone already did. \r\n\r\nOr you
    could hire it done. It would be pretty cheap!\r\n\r\nHave you looked for fonts
    on myfont/s.com with he key word fax?"

  body: "I actually tried using 'fax' before I tried 'matrix'. It was not as productive.
    Your suggestion certainly would be an alternative method to recreate the typeface
    from the machine.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
