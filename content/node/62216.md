  found what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nI'm aiming somewhere between [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans/bold-oblique/|Serpentine
  Sans]] which carries a certain unwanted 70s car chase movie vibe and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/muscle/|Muscle]]
  which is just not quite legible enough. I'm mostly concerned with the digits and
  the uppercase alphabet for captions.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"
