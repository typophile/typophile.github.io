body: "<strong>Serif: The Magazine of Type & Typography</strong> was an interesting
  periodical for the typographic arts. It was published on a quarterly basis by Don
  Hosek. It received praise from around the world for its coverage of the design and
  use of type, and it did actually have some rather good content.\r\n\r\nThere is
  still a <a href=\"http://www.serifmagazine.com/\">web site</a> for it, but it has
  not been updated since 2000, so don't get your hopes up. In fact numerous people
  -including some early adopters- were promised refunds on subscriptions but have
  been waiting for years (see the Typo-L archives). Don Hosek happens to be one of
  the founders of TypeRight, an organization that professes to promote ethical behavior
  in the field of type."
