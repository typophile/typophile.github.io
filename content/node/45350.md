  about digitizing it. It is quirky, with ornate caps, and has an exterior texture.
  Purely an antique titling font but not your typical Modern face. So I thought why
  not. Whatcha think and should I duck?\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rough_3547.jpg]"

  body: I think it is a very lovely take on this style. The one thing you might add
    are "regular" caps. I think this would make it more usable.

    If you'll pardon a little critique, I think the end stroke on your 'n's could
    use a little baseline overshoot.\r\n\r\nGet it out there, Michael. God knows we
    need more good alternatives to Papyrus.\r\n"

  body: "\"No speaky Papyrus!\"\r\n\r\nHa ha! Nice talk, folks! \r\n\r\nMichael, I
    like the roman, but I have to admit I don't see the swashy romantic caps going
    with it. I'd just focus on the scratchy modern. It's so informal already with
    italic outstrokes and ball terminals; The informality makes for an interesting
    feel. If there were a big loud bold to go with it I bet it would satisfy. \r\n\r\nLook
    at some of the informal copperplate styles in the old PLINC catalogs, at Akira
    Kobayashi's new Cosmiqua, which is sort of informal/modern, and the interesting,
    crumpled modern used in Martha Stewart Living, Surveyor. That has an informal
    quality as well. Yours, as display, could evoke everything from old gravestones
    to historic painted signs to certificates and deeds. \r\n\r\nAlso consider the
    intensity of the roughness. If it's kept at a certain level, it may scale better.
    Too rough and it will just look blurry at small sizes. "

  body: "The roughness is pretty similar to Peanut and it sets pretty well at smaller
    sizes. I always tell people that anything I design is not meant for small sizes,
    can't stop'em though. As to the caps I hear all of you loud and clear. A set of
    relative caps would be the best way to go but I want to keep the Script. This
    \"face\", and it is complete, was used in an annual report with swash caps and
    I kinda liked the secondary rhythm. Looking at this with fresh eyes you all have
    supplied me I feel the need for speed... some kick ass ligatures which I did not
    draw for this job. I knew it was a good idea to throw this up here and wait for
    the weigh in. Keep it coming. I will try and upload the lower case.\r\n\r\nBTW
    some of the weights are a tad off. The l.c. a is a bit heavy etc.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    think we were suggesting you lose the swash caps, but add standard caps to give
    it more opportunities for use."

    spaces of the diagonal letters might be a bit bigger than they need to be ( not
