  clean looking sans was originally drawn in three weights for the Mori Art Museum
  in Japan. (www.mori.art.museum), Bourgeois has been now been released as a major
  32 weight family. It is not the most experimental font we have designed (it has
  a very light virusfonts touch to it) but it is certainly one of the most usable,
  well crafted and mature.  We hope you will find that suitable for a number of uses,
  both text and display, please check the virusfonts website at www.virusfonts.com
  for specimen sheets and pricing details.\r\n \r\n\r\n+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+ \r\n\r\n\r\n"
