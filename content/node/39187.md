  body: "Do a search - \"40 BOND\" has come up way too many times in the past couple
    of years. I believe it was identified as a custom Caslon for the New York Times
    Magazine.\r\n\r\nStephen did <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-thin-ultra-light-fonts/\"
    target=\"_blank\">a piece</a> in August about extra light type. There's a section
    on extra light serifs you might like. Also check out <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts/\"
    target=\"_blank\">his entry</a> from July about Extra Bold fonts, for the High
    Contrast section.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    2007 project, it would not have been too prominent on the type-ID boards\r\n\r\nanyhow,
    thanks for the links!"
