body: "A significant part of my job involves giving lectures and presentations, and
  I like them to look good.  So I am in search of an attractive, readable font for
  presentation slides.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I'm having a hard time finding anything
  better than Apple's Keynote default, Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nGill Sans is great \u2013
  I think I'm looking for <em>some</em> humanist sans \u2013 but it would be nice
  to have something a bit more unusual, and for which /l/ and /1/ are more distinct.\r\n\r\nOne
  problem in matching or exceeding Gill Sans's quality seems to be that it has hit
  some sort of a sweet spot in weight and/or kerning.  For example, the current contender
  is Calluna Sans. It seems GS is just a bit heavier than CS (at least CS regular;
  haven't tried semibold), and the effect is that the ratio of space-between-words
  to space-between-letters is higher in GS than in CS ... so it appears visually easier
  to pick out words in Gill Sans, and therefore it seems easier to read.  Or, maybe
  that's totally subjective.  (Or maybe I should be trying to make presentations <em>harder</em>
  to read ... but that's  [[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/health/19mind.html|another
  story]].)\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering whether anyone has suggestions on appropriate
  fonts, or the kerning/weight issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\n\u2013 from
  a Typophile newbie."

  body: "Why sans? I usually use seriffed faces in my presentations. Then again I
    need a lot of weird characters and diacritics \u2013 phonetics, uncommon languages,
    semantics symbols \u2013 so there aren\u2019t many decent sans faces that fit
    my needs. But is there a reason why one should opt for sans over serif in a presentation?"

  body: Thanks for the additional suggestions.  I'm told that sans serif is more readable,
    especially at a distance.  It seems a good idea to err on the side of more readable,
    especially if one might encounter unfamiliar presentation conditions.  Still,
    I'm not sure how much of a difference it actually makes.  Serif might be fine
    if one uses reasonable font sizes (which many people don't).

    they seem to read better (even at small sizes), and is more informal.\r\nAlthough,

  body: "I would actually argue that serif typefaces are easier to read.\r\nLet us
    take books for an example, they are all written in a seriffed font.  The serif's
    give fluidity when reading, hence the reason why all books are written in it.\r\n\r\nA
    clean san serif typeface is usually more appropriate for headings and advertisements.
    \ Main reason why they are used in most advertisements is for their clean look
    and appear more modern then serif fonts.\r\n\r\nHowever you did mention that this
    was a presentation, which I'm assuming entails the use of a projector.  If it's
    a bad projector, you might want to go with san-serif because some lower end projectors
    cannot project serif's in a clean manor, making it messy and harder to read.\r\n"

    [[http://typophile.com/node/82273|a new thread]] on this topic so I thought I
    would post with what I concluded.  (Not much of a \"conclusion\" really, just
    personal preferences of someone who is not a professional designer...)\r\n\r\n<strong>The
    most attractive font</strong> I found was [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100042|Ideal
    Sans]].  Absolutely beautiful but prohibitively expensive for me:  I often need
    to post public PDFs of my slides and this requires an extra license that starts
    at $150 per style per year (!!).\r\n\r\n<strong>Also quite nice:</strong> [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_yoga_sans_ot/|Yoga

    Sensibility or Calluna or just sticking with Gill Sans are currently the top choices.
