  Battle: Typo-O-Lantern Pumpkin Carving</strong>\r\nHalloween 2007\r\n\r\n// <strong>Rules</strong>\r\n1-
  Carve, cut, etch, &c., your typographic design, letterform or mark into a pumpkin
  or other gourd.\r\n\r\n2- Post a photograph (600 x 400 please) of your entry in
  this thread. Feel free to inform us about your method, inspiration, &c. but the
  best entries will speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n3- As with other type battles, this
  starts on a Monday and ends this Friday (which happens to be 2 days after Halloween,
  no points will be reduced with November entries).\r\n\r\n// <strong>Judging & Prizes</strong>\r\nAs
  with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize \u2014 only the
  ability to call yourself the best on the block."

  body: Ah, nice, a battle. Don't think I will be joining this one, unfortunately.
    But I've never participated in a battle on typophile before, since they sorta
    stopped just before I joined. I would like to see a return of the Type Battles.
    :)

    Treatment of Vegetables) I have to protest about this outrage. Slashing into an
    innocent gourd for no good reason (not even a prize). Vegetables have feeling
    too, you know. They shouldn't be treated as mere food or amusement devices for
    unthinking people. \r\n\r\nDon't carve your pumpkin, talk to it ... it is -kin-
    after all."

    up making soup. James Peterson's book <em>Splendid Soups</em> offers a modified
    Paul Bocuse recipe for roasted pumpkin soup I'd always wanted to try. Sorry, didn't
    take any photos. (Also roasted the pumpkin seeds.)"
