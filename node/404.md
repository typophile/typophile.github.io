body: Hallo,  <BR>I have to create a corporate logo which takes his name from the
  &#39;alpha&#39; greek letter. I&#39;d like to make something stylish not relying
  on the &#39;a&#39; Symbol glyph. Any type resource to suggest?  <BR> <BR>TIA <BR>m.

  body: Then maybe do a low-res bitmap rendering of a Greek alpha. Like check out
    the Xerox logo - do they still use that? The one where part of an UC &#34;X&#34;
    is a degrading bitmap. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
