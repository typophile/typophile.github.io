body: "The native Mayas lived in the Mesoamerican region (Central America) from around
  2500 BC. Their intelligent and beautiful written language is quite unknown to the
  western world, and even Central Americans, because it remained undeciphered for
  centuries. My work proposes a re-interpretation of the original Maya hieroglyphs
  with the aim of applying them to contemporary visual communications by designing
  new symbols and pictograms that can be used in sign design across archaeological
  and public sites in Central America. The \u2018New Maya Hieroglyphs\u2019 enhance
  the site users visiting and learning experience and, can act as regenerative agents
  for Central America\u2019s graphic culture.\r\n\r\nJoya de Cer\xE9n archaeological
  site in El Salvador, which was my case study, is about common citizen\u2019s way
  of living, about their eating habits, social relations, architecture and agriculture.
  Unfortunately, the Maya written language was not democratic so the \u2018New Maya
  Hieroglyphs\u2019 act as an accessible bridge between the content and the general
  audience; they can surpass any language barrier, literacy disadvantage or disability
  through their exposure in public locations or through their appreciation as an art
  form.\r\n\r\nThis is a modest attempt to bring value to the Maya cultural identity
  and a celebration of Mesoamerica\u2019s indigenous roots. A revival of the Maya
  language becomes a viable path for developing cultural symbols that inspire future
  generations and bring new life to the sacred stones."

    I have to confess that as a child I was interested in archaeology and found Maya
    and Aztec hieroglyphs fascinating, so I am a bit biased in my appreciation!"

    this work beautiful :)\r\n\r\nI didn't quite understand how you plan to use them.
    \r\n\r\nWould this form a sort of vocabulary by itself. Where each image becomes
    almost a pictogram. Or would you use it more as a kind of embellishment?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    what was the  Maya written language like? Is it a script that still survives?

    in English so that the rest can understand.\r\n\r\nWell they are indeed fascinating,
    the more I learn the more I want to swap my Mac for a 4x4 and live in an archaeological
    site for the rest of my life! I will start design work on at least one archaeological
    site in Cop\xE1n, Honduras, Mesoamerica which was the greatest artistic Maya area
    across the region \u2013 so my dream is just starting to come true. The main Cop\xE1n
    park holds the largest written book in the world with 2500 beautifully carved
    glyphs reading up-wards on the 63-step staircase (see panoramic pic area to the
    right covered by green plastic). Just as a curious note, if you can find hieroglyphic
    content in a site it usually means that it was highly developed and its governor
    (king) had great regional power \u2013 the power of knowledge!\r\n\r\nwww.fridalarios.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Copan1_6486.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Copan2_5089.jpg]"

  body: "writingdesigning,\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments. This was my MA project
    at Central Saint Martins. After research on the original glyphs (around 30 of
    them of more than 2000 deciphered), in which I classified (see first figure below),
    vectorised, and colour-coded them (see second figure below). I then used this
    study to generate two types of new glyphs \u2013 a) logograms specifically for
    story-telling and, b) wayfinding pictograms. The original glyphs are both syllabographic
    and logographic i.e. the symbols can mean a syllable or mean what they graphically
    represent. A glyph (short for hieroglyph) is usually composed of sub-glyphs. In
    my work I am just proposing logograms so, what you see is what you get. They were
    formed by redesigning the originals for better legibility and combining sub-glyphs
    to form new meanings that communicate contemporary ideas or the story of an archaeological
    site (like in this case). Hope I have made myself clear, maybe I make it more
    complicated than it is! \r\n\r\nThe applicability is endless. Like I said above
    I will be working in Cop\xE1n in a unique Maya archaeological site that will let
    a niche audience (not the usual tourist) see how archaeologists excavate and research
    the site. The information will be published through signage as soon as it becomes
    available. My project falls well into place as my final objective is a) to make
    the visiting of a public site a learning and interactive experience through a
    beautiful yet content-relevant designed information system, and b) to let visual
    communicators become a part of multi-disciplinary teams where you've usually had
    engineers or architects playing that role. The government and archaeologists over
    there are quite open to my ideas which is a great start. Let's see how it goes
    though.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, the essay will be published on the ISTD's
    TypoGraphic 66. The books are just limited edition (self-printed and bound) but
    it would be nice to publish the guide-book that tells the case study archaeological
    site's story and explains how I designed/ composed each 'New Maya Glyph'. If anybody
    has any ideas on where to find an apt publisher I would be grateful although maybe
    it's too ambitious and nobody will buy it!\r\n\r\nwww.fridalarios.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MG-Classification_3922.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MG-ColourCoded_4716.jpg]"

    passion for the topic is so evident.  Which is probably why people from other
    disciplines - architects, engineers, archaeologists, have been so receptive. \r\n\r\n\"it
    would be nice to publish the guide-book..\"\r\nDon't you have something like a
    heritage conservation body out there which would be interested? Something similar
    to the National Trust in the UK, or INTACH in India?   \r\n\r\nI suppose it would
    be really nice if you could in some way publish it in a form where it engages
    local children. \r\n\r\nThanks and great luck ahead!"

  body: "Here are some spreads of my new 'New Maya Language' book.  This book compiles
    my previous works in a simple easy to understand format.\r\n\r\nThe New Maya Language
    is a redesign and recomposition of certain original Maya script ideographs that
    communicate concepts and even sentences.  It parallels the principle of the Chinese-concept
    script where primary root or Lego-like pictographs can be combined to generate
    compound pictographs that signify a more complex idea (Chizlet C.). \r\n\r\nThe
    first \u2018Maya Language\u2019 section of the book introduces a basic understanding
    of how the Maya writing system works. \r\n\r\nThe second section tells the story
    'Joya de Cer\xE9n' UNESCO World Heritage Archaeological Site in El Salvador in
    Central America through 23 New Maya Language glyphs.  Spread by spread the reader
    is introduced to each one of them and how they were formulated. For example, \u2018Stone\u2019
    + \u2018Fire\u2019 combined equal the \u2018Lavastone\u2019 New Maya Language
    ideograph.\r\n\r\nFinally, the \u2018Applications\u2019 section shows real life
    examples of how the New Maya Language can be taken forward to other forms of visual
    communication, such as brand identities. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-0_4902.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-2_6005.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-5_5857.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-6_5480.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-7_6642.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-9_4517.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-14_3894.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-15_5656.JPG]"
