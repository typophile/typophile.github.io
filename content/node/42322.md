body: "I'm trying to identify the typefaces from an old newspaper where I live. It's
  from 1958 and, although I have some fonts that are quite similar, they are not exactly
  the same. I'm trying to identify the faces for:\r\n\r\na) Titles\r\nb) Credits\r\nc)
  Body Text\r\nd) Newspaper Logo\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a photograph of the newspaper.
  Can someone help me? Thanks in advance!"

  body: "b) Metrolite, part of the Metro family by W.A. Dwiggins. Digital version
    here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metrolite_no_2/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    headlines might be Bauer Bodoni. It's hard to tell whether the ball-less endings
    on the f & j are design characteristics or the result of bad printing or wear
    and tear on the metal type."

    \"fazendo\" looks beautiful. Great side effects \u2026\r\n"

  body: "The main difference between Excelsior and Corona is width. Corona being developed
    later to save space and is a tad more narrow. The sample seems to be a better
    match for Excelsior with it's nearly round 'C', 'G', and 'O'. I'd give it to Poms
    for the ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/excelsior_lt_std_roman_ot/?sample_text=ROUND%20GOQ\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/corona_lt_std_ot/?sample_text=NOT%20ROUND%20GOQ"

  body: I'm quite sure it's not <em>Corona</em>, the "n" and "a" differ too much.
    BTW I can only check against digital of course. Yes, i'm curious what it is in
    the end :)
