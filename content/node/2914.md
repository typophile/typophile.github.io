  body: MyFonts used to sell ITC Bookman Swash, but now it doesn&#39;t list it anymore.
    <BR>Here&#39;s a character map of the font... it has been customised a little
    for the &#39;Chelsea Girls&#39; title. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25236.png"

  body: As was brought up in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24826.html?1075471587">the
    recent thread</a>, the ITC version is not the same as the version shown in Richard&#39;s
    sample, especially in the lowercase. The original Bookman Italic had a slanted
    roman lowercase, not the cursive italic of the ITC version. This is the biggest
    difference between the two. There are also a lot of other less obvious differences.

  body: Also, it looks like there was some custom work done on it &#40;the way the
    &#34;h&#34; hooks into the &#34;l&#34; and so on&#41;.

  body: 'Sorry, Adriano, I wasn&#39;t sure what you meant when you then showed the
    ITC version. <BR> <BR>For the benefit of anyone who would like to see the differences
    between the two: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25242.gif"
    alt="bookmans"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s too bad that the original has not made it to
    the digital realm. &#40;Supposedly, Castcrafters did one, but it&#39;s apparently
    no longer available. Bitstream has a version, but no swashes and no Bold or Bold
    Italic.&#41; It&#39;s not exactly fashionable, but it&#39;s an historically significant
    face.'
