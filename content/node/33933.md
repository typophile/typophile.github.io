body: "Hi there!!\r\n\r\nI'd like some help on an opentype error that a customer found
  in my fonts After.\r\n\r\nThe fonts have special ligatures and alternate caps. The
  problem is happening in the CALT (Capital Alternatives) feature, only in Photoshop
  CS2 for Mac.\r\n\r\nThe standard version of the characters can't be accessed. By
  default, the feature is turned ON, and is gray shaded (disabled for access/change).\r\n\r\nWhen
  testing this on Photoshop CS2 in PC, a nasty surprise: the fonts don't even appear.
  They became invisible. The fonts that don't have OT substitution features (Text
  version) of my family appear normally. So it could be something OT related.\r\n\r\nThe
  sintax of this feature is this:\r\n\r\nfeature calt { #Alternate Caps\r\n  sub A
  by capaalt;\r\n  sub Agrave by capaaltgrave;\r\n  sub Aacute by capaaltacute;\r\n
  \ sub Acircumflex by capaaltcircumflex;\r\n  sub Atilde by capaalttilde;\r\n  sub
  Adieresis by capaaltdieresis;\r\n  sub Aring by capaaltring;\r\n  sub R by capralt;\r\n
  \ sub T by captalt;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nI simply have no idea of why is it happening.
  Is this a Photoshop issue that I can't resolve? Or is there a way to fix it?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think Photoshop behaves correctly. Feature 'calt' is intended for CONTEXTUAL
    substitutions. You don't specify the context, therefore the substitutions are
    applied immediately. The alternative forms of capital letters should be placed
    in different feature, probably 'titl'. Special ligatures in 'liga' or 'dlig' depending
    on your preferences.\r\n\r\nBtw. you use VERY nonstandard glyph names. You should
    definitely use the dot convention specified here http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3065.
    Instead of <strong>capalt</strong> you should rather use <strong>t.calt</strong>,
    resp. <strong>t.titl</strong>.  "

  body: "Fabio,\r\n\r\n1. The feature 'calt' does NOT stand for \"Capital Alternatives\",
    it stands for \"Contextual Alternates\".\r\n\r\n2. I believe 'titl' (Titling)
    is the feature you're looking for.\r\n\r\n3. The glyph names of your alternates
    are quite odd; you should use 'A.capalt' instead of 'capaalt', 'Agrave.capalt'
    instead of 'capaaltgrave', and so on.\r\n\r\n4. There are known issues regarding
    the 'calt' feature and Photoshop CS2, but I never heard of fonts not showing up
    because of that. Your use of the 'calt' feature is definitely incorrect*, and
    that might be the reason why Photoshop doesn't recognize your fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    gather your fonts will start working as expected as soon as you make the changes
    suggested above.\r\n\r\n* The substitutions have no context, like <code>sub A'
    V by A.capalt;</code>\r\n\r\n(Filip, sorry for the overlap; your post wasn't there
    when I started writing.)"
