body: "I have noticed an interesting phenomenon when educating design students on
  the use of grids, styles, and master pages. Teaching this stuff to younger college
  kids (ages 18\u201322) is a slow, tedious task. I have to start with very simple
  exercises and constantly remind the students to use grids and styles. By the end
  of the semester some of them still cannot wrap their heads around their inability
  to produce a coherent multi-page document as having something to do with their constant
  refusal to just set up a gridded master page and create text styles. Even the lazy
  ones don't seem to realize that doing this would allow them to keep being lazy and
  slap a quick modernist piece together.\r\n\r\nBut things are absolutely different
  with adult students. My older college students (age 24+) and adult education students
  seem to pick up on these concepts in about five minutes flat. I show them a few
  slides, do an Indesign demonstration, and hand out an example file packed with sample
  grids. The next week they show up with consistent hierarchies and page proportions.
  \r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this? Do you have any insight to share on why
  adults who sometimes barely manage a web browser can handle grids and styles so
  easily while kids who live and breathe computers often find these concepts utterly
  incomprehensible?"

    \"knowledge\" in the age of Google. It appears that many young people, growing
    up in a webcentric world, confuse instant access to information with knowledge.
    This is simply not so: knowledge is hard-won and it is cumulative, Furthermore,
    knowledge is dependent on--and, paradoxically, also increased by--pattern recognition.
    If the answers are simply handed to you on a platter, the path that leads to them
    is never seen.\r\n\r\nPlus, since youngster of a certain age <strong>always</strong>
    know more than their elders, it's difficult to convince them that \"the old ways\"
    have any value. Of course, that's just my curmudgeonly opinion; some young whippersnapper
    will probably set me straight..."

  body: "I've noticed this as well. Being one of the 24+ year-old students, I've seen
    classmates with the same confused and frustrated look with regards to grids. I
    think oldnick is right with his comment regarding the difference between \"knowledge
    & information\". The younger students, from my experience, have a hard time understanding
    the idea of applying steps as a means to an end and not as the end result. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    it's because they think it is more work without any immediate benefit (it takes
    a little more time to set up a grid), time that could be spent throwing information
    onto the page and moving on to solving the next problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems that
    lately (I've discussed this with other professors and they seem to agree), younger
    students seem to lack problem-solving skills; almost as if the end goal of any
    design or academic problem could be solved through collecting and retaining information\u2014not
    through critical thinking or experimentation. "

  body: "My experience has been that a surprising number of designers (of all ages)
    don't use style sheets and sometimes not even master pages. At least not on shorter
    documents.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's laziness, or lack of proper training, or
    feeling that these things impose too much rigidity to the design, or a feeling
    that setting these things up takes more time than they save.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    why your younger students are having more problems, but you might want to set
    up some assignments in a way that using style sheets actually saves them time.
    For example, a multi-page project in which their assignment calls for them to
    to set it 2 different ways, and they get a graphic demonstration that using style
    sheets makes that kind of change a snap.\r\n"

    lack the passion for design we grow-ups have. And they're used to getting things
    pretty fast, which might play against them (I guess the same could be said for
    us older designer compared to our predecessors?)\r\n\r\nJames might have a great
    idea by the way: Give them some text and tell them to set it up in a multi-page
    document (don't mention grids yet). Then, give them another text and tell them
    to set it up on a grid (maybe provided by you? Or to use one from some examples
    you provide?). If they compare the results and time spent on both, the right answer
    should pop right up.\r\n\r\nOr maybe they'll like the non-grid one better and
    the whole thing backfires\u2026\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: " > James might have a great idea...\r\n> tell them to set it up on a grid\r\n\r\nThanks
    but I was actually referring to style sheets as a timesaver, not grids.  \r\n\r\nGrids
    are certainly a good thing, and I guess they can save time in some situations,
    but I think of style sheets and master pages as practical tools which 1) insure
    consistency and 2) make it faster and easier to make changes. And I think that
    many people regard #2 as their main motivation for using them. \r\n\r\nIf you
    create a long document and then decide to make changes to the margins, fonts,
    type color, point sizes, or whatever, it might take quite a while to go through
    the document and change each instance manually, but if you've used style sheets
    and master pages you can make those global changes in seconds."

  body: "I agree with JamesM. Way back in the college days when I would do a lot of
    prepress work for folks I saw a LOT of disorganized files. QuarkXPress files linking
    to non-existent images. No Style Sheets. PDFs generated with the wrong settings.
    Etc. \r\n\r\nEarly jobs as a web designer in large agencies gave me plenty of
    experience with PSD files where designers couldn't be bothered with grouping layers,
    or deleting unneeded ones. Nothing like trying to figure out a 99 layer PSD file.
    \r\n\r\nAs such, my theory is that the older students just have more experience
    with whatever they've done and value the organizational part of what they are
    doing as much as the creative side. \r\n\r\nThe older that craftsman gets, the
    more particular they are about how their tool box is kept organized. "

    a design manager told me that he felt some junior designers deliberately created
    complex files as job insurance. They figured that if no one else at the office
    could figure out how they constructed the file, then they couldn't be fired until
    the end of the project. He told me that software programmers have been known to
    use a similar strategy as job insurance.\r\n\r\nHis theory was interesting, but
    personally I feel that Aluminum is correct that it's mostly just lack of experience.\r\n\r\n"

    Life stages: when you're 13-22, all you have is time. Us adults have busy lives
    that need more efficiency. 24+, you've probably have held a real job and needed
    to become more productive. Before that, who cares if you have to recreate a template
    99 times? Necessity is the mother of invention. \r\n\r\nTry creating a need for
    them to use master pages, by giving them an overwhelming volume of work. Then
    you'll see who works smart over who works hard.\r\n\r\nTo that last point, I think
    95% of people are fed the line that hard work is everything. Spending a prodigious
    amount of hours at something means you've done good at it. Which isn't really
    the truth. Ultimately, you must produce something worth while."
