body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm completely new to the world of typography (until this weekend
  I didn't know the difference between serif fonts and sans serif fonts), and after
  thinking about the fact that fonts can make a drastic influence on how someone perceives
  you based on the font you use in your email or site. Also, English is not my first
  language, so I apologize for any mistakes in my writing (especially spelling and
  grammar).\r\n\r\nI was wondering you if you guys could help me with something that
  I have been thinking about all day today. I did do a Google search and read many
  articles, but no article really answered my question.\r\n\r\nWe all know that Times
  New Roman size 12 is the preferred font for letters, resumes and any serious communication
  (if I'm wrong about this I apologize).\r\n\r\nI was wondering what the equivalent
  font, and more importantly font size, would be for emails. I mainly use email to
  communicate with friends and family, but will have to start using it for communicating
  with professors and sending out my resume. I'm looking for a font that is easily
  readable and still looks professional. So far, it seems like verdana, helvetica
  and helvetica neue are probably the right way to go. But, I'm more curious to know
  what size would be best. (I know some computers and smartphones will display the
  text differently.)\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any assistance at all.\r\n\r\nOne last
  question: Avenir is a font that I found that, in my opinion, looks amazing. Would
  this be an okay font to use for email?\r\n\r\nThank you all in advance for your
  help, I truly appreciate it."

    font on their system, of course. So Verdana, Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman are
    safe choices. \r\nAvenir is of course safe on Macs, but I'm not sure what packages
    on Windows install it. So Windows users would probably see your email in Arial.
    Or more likely, whatever they've set their default to. "

    up to date, which is obviously a bad assumption. \r\n\r\n"

    when it was added to Mac OS.

    older versions.

  body: "i don't tend to use helvetica in body copy, \"because Helvetica looks like
    dogshit in text\" -- to quote paul rand.\r\n\r\nfor size, 16px plus is best. 16px
    is the default in most web browsers. sometimes you'd want to set the font size
    smaller or larger, depending on the situation. but as a heuristic it's solid,
    imo."
