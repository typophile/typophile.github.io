  They&#39;re being hung up on the campus of Notre Dame today. I&#39;m interested
  in making this poster better for my portfolio, as I&#39;m job searching. <BR> <BR>I
  researched a few poster companies such as Hatch Show Print and Yeehaw Industries.
  I love their country/western style of letterpress and since this poster was for
  a camp in Texas, I felt it appropriate. There&#39;s a lot of stars because, well,
  the Lonestar State. I don&#39;t have a letterpress sitting around so I had to use
  the computer. That meant I could take some liberties with the type, and I think
  it&#39;s doing OK. <BR> <BR>But how can I make this poster better? You can see a
  full sized gif and the pdf here: <a href="http://www.whoisdan.com/sweeney">whoisdan.com/sweeney</a>.

    baseline.

  body: Well, this being Typophile you might get less feedback than for a font design
    - but I think people might still have good typographic suggestions. I personally
    like the overall design, but maybe more &#34;adventurous&#34; fonts could be used?
    Like wood-type looking stuff? <BR> <BR>Good move on the traps! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Good call on the traps. Like I said when I emailed you, I knew they were there,
    but I didn&#39;t know they were traps. I&#39;ve seen traps on other faces and
    they look a lot more deliberate. <BR> <BR>I should probably stop being a cheap
    bastard and buy a font or two. Maybe when I get a job. Sorry, Mr. Shinn, Helvetica
    is about all I got. <BR> <BR>&#34;e&#34; is fixed. Thanks. I&#39;ve yet to see
    this thing printed out. That should help me out.

  body: There&#39;s a wonderful&#42; article by Tamye Riggs in the current issue of
    HOW magazine about high-quality free fonts. That might put you on the road to
    buying fonts!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; One reason it&#39;s wonderful is that in
    a number of places she makes a nicely subtle point of stating that people should
    still buy fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    But seriously, I don&#39;t buy much, but I&#39;d like to buy a few fonts, including
    FF Dax...

  body: 'Daniel, some thoughts. <BR>The thing is that If you go for a Typographic
    poster &#40;which I love them&#41; the Type is Very important, and in the style
    you have chosen even more. Like Hrant said I would try a wooden type, extended
    and condensed, or regular and condensed, you will need both of them to make differences
    and I would not mix them with helveticas &#40;you can keep this ones for the presentations
    and so make it a different part of the poster, I see it now a little bit confuse&#42;&#41;,
    I am aware of your cash-type-problem, but I would consider something low price
    like <a href="http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5275" target=_top>Goshen</a>
    or something a little less distressed and more regular, and you&#39;ll have fun
    for the same price!. <BR>&#42; Someone told me once that the design starts in
    the order, and that&#39;s one of the few thigs I am sure in my job, and for your
    poster, what is the most important thing? The second? The third? keep that in
    mind, I think that in your case at least is so important Summer Employment Opportunity
    &#40;or is Summer Employment. Opportunity!&#41; as Camp Sweeney. At a first and
    fast look &#40;the way most of the posters are seen&#41; my eyes go at Sweeney
    and at the same time at Debartol and at Opportunity, I would try to make more
    differences using the two colors and sizes, you could try to put the presentations
    a little smaller &#40;Don&#39;t worry, if I am interested in a Summer Employment
    Opportunity in Camp Sweeney I will read it, and if they are sponsors I still think
    are too big&#41;. <BR>Two quick thoughts: <BR>Consider using not a white paper,
    some with light brown tono, and I don&#39;t mean an expensive and soft &#40;?&#41;
    one. <BR>Maybe too many stars? I think you are in The Thin Red Line between Circus
    and West style from my spanish point of view. <BR>I really like the way you have
    made and arrange the three presentations and the Date-Place-Map, nice, you got
    it. <BR> <BR>I hope it helps !'
