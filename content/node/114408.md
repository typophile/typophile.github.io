  body: "Without more letters it's very hard to use the R alone for an ID. The fact
    that these letters seem manufactured, and not printed, means they may not even
    be based on an actual typeface. I looked in Rookledge's Type Finder for this style
    of R and none of them was an exact match. The proportions seem rather awkward,
    in that the leg of the R doesn't seem to reach the baseline.\r\n\r\nAny more letters?
    Any idea of the age of the sample?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
