<div class=commentbody>Ok Nick. I am trying to find the old mechanical machine that you put a 4 x 7 (roughly) film neg in (it had aluminum handles on the end) and it jumped up and down and sideways in an enclosed environment... exposing it to Agfa film. That was after the typesetters had done their thing on the old CRT's, kerning and all. I remember it as being Alphatype machinery. Not the PT. Does that ring a bell. It made a hell of a noise.

Get a hold of a book written by Ed Rondthaler called Life in Letters as they turned Photogenic . . .
That will definitely get you started!

<div class=commentbody>Michael, you're thinking of the early-day Alphatype machines. I used them in those early days and am pretty familiar with just about every aspect of them, inside and out.
What do you want to know about them?

That would only happen when you sent things to the printer, if I understand your question correctly. Photo type was always black and white, as far as I know.

<div class=commentbody>George, just trying to remember manufacturer etc. so that I could steer pdxuser in the right direction. After the Alphatype we went to Alphaset, I think, and ITC faces. Much quieter. Just old memories coming back into a rattled (or is that a riddled) old brain. I used to love to sit in the dark and experiment with spacing and effects of the PT. That was what got me started in lettering.

Well, if said printer is using offset printing, it goes something like <a href=http://www.howstuffworks.com/offset-printing.htm>this</a>. :-)</div>

In the olden days (before we did everything on computers), all "camera-ready artwork" was in black and white--not even gray was allowed. If you had full color or grayscale artwork to print, that had to be handled separately and "stripped into" the negative film before making printing plates.
The black areas on your camera-ready artwork were the parts that would be inked on the press. So, whatever color ink was going to be used, that was what color it would be, even though it was black on your artwork. Whatever was white on your camera-ready art would not get ink, not get printed. So those areas would be whatever color the paper was (usually white) or whatever other colors were already printed (or would be printed) in those areas.
Grayscale images could not be printed as is and needed to be converted to black and white "halftones", which are really only black and white, but give the illusion of shades of gray by using tiny dots of different sizes.
Full color images needed to be "separated" using colored filters into four different halftone images. The four images would be printed in four different inks--black, cyan, magenta, and yellow--giving the illusion of full color.
All of these elements--black and white artwork or halftones--would be photographed with high contrast negative film and assembled together by a "stripper" using red tape (which photographed as black).
You could also tell the printer that you wanted certain areas or elements of your artwork to be a certain shade of gray by making a note on the artwork. The stripper would make a new negative film element of that part of the art using a halftone filter and strip it into position in place of the original.
After all the negatives were assembled and ready, they would be used to make the plates (which are photo-sensitive) by making a kind of contact print.
Etc.
The thing is, the basic principles of all this are still true, but the computer has made negative stripping unnecessary and obsolete, and all the complicated planning and set up that used to be needed to put "color letters on photo backgrounds" is just a matter of moving things around on a computer screen and clicking on color swatch palettes and making sure thing are stacked right the right order. The software takes care of the rest. We don't even need negatives anymore--the black and white images needed for printing are exposed, fully assembled, directly to the printing plate.
On the other hand, you never had to worry about missing fonts back then.</div>
