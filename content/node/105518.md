body: I am planning an instagram birthday party for my daughter (gotta love tweens),
  and was wondering what font is used for the username, or for the "likes". I thought
  it was Arial Rounded but am not entirely sure... Any help?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-Shot-2012-04-11-at-9_13_14-AM_5802.png]
