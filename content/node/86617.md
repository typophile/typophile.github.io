  of you can help me ID this font. I keep seeing this poster when im out and about
  advertising a club night (see poster below) and i know the font is very similar
  to that used in Michael Jacksons Thriller video.. but i can't for the life of me
  find out any further info about it.\r\n\r\nAnyone know where i can buy/download
  it?\r\n(should just point out im talking about the typeface in RED)\r\n\r\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/319691_301217306558453_200670299946488_1386944_379640719_n.jpg"

  body: Hmmm that does seem a pretty close match, i'm just wondering though if <strong>Flogged</strong>
    was ripped off another typeface, cause it looks a bit live-traced IMO!
