  body: "Could be Century Expanded from an IBM Selectric Composer. It was basically
    a typewriter, but it had proportional fonts and was often used for typesetting
    low-budget publications and documents. Century Expanded and other common typefaces
    were available for it.\r\n\r\nhttp://ibmcomposer.org/SelComposer/description.htm\r\n"

  body: "Just barely. They usually had something like a four-unit spacing system,
    meaning that there were four different possible character widths. \r\n\r\nI worked
    with a low-end phototypesetter back in the Seventies that used only four-units.
    Even the high-end systems (such as the Linotype V.I.P.) were usually only 16-units
    per em. We are so spoiled."
