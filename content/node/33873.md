body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nWe would like to announce that <a href=\"http://www.global-type.org/Searching.743.0.html\">Global
  Type's database</a> is online now. Based on the typeface collection of Hans Reichardt,
  Frankfurt am Main, who has been collecting typefaces for over 40 years, you can
  search in 91,076 typefaces, 2348 type designers or punchcutters and 1047 foundries.
  For the first time there is an overview about the typefaces of the 20th century,
  almost complete by name. But \u2013\_that is to say \u2013 we only have a few samples
  by now (2749 pictures), and they do all come from the German type specimen book
  \u201CDas Handbuch der Schriftarten\u201D (Seemann, 1926). We have scanned all the
  images, written down all the information in the left row, so that all the information
  of this book is available online now with some restrictions.\r\nPlease don't misunderstand:
  We don't want to compete with the existing commercial solutions, and our database
  is intended more to give help for research questions. The existing content is protected
  by now, but later you will be able to log in and expand the collection. The input
  will be inspected and released afterwards.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nLars K\xE4hler\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.global-type.org/Searching.743.0.html"

  body: "Impressive effort! I hope you build it up well and quickly.\r\nReal quick:
    the Arabic text in your language selection image\r\nis set with disjoined letters,
    which of course looks wrong.\r\n\r\nBTW, the \"onion model\" idea seems quite
    interesting!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "(late answer)\r\n\r\nThank you for your compliment as well as your encouraging.
      I think the detail with the wrong setten Arabic is an item that can be corrected
      in a handrum. Could you eventually - or somebody else, of couse - send a correct
      version in a vector format? I will exchange it immediately.\r\n"
