body: I've tried identifying this type using the identifont site, but failed.  I thought
  this was an easy one.  I'm just trying to figure out the font used in making this
  table, so I may make some projects of my own.  The thought did occur that the original
  builders created the letters themselves just for this project.   Here is the photo
  and link to a page with more photos. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/shazam_4941.jpg]    http://doyoulovewhereyoulive.com/archives/hand-crafted-typographic-comic-book-inspired-shazam-table
