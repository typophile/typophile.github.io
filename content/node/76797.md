  body: This was a fairly common hand-lettering style on British books at this time.
    Most British lettering books from this era, such as Cecil Wade's, have hand-drawn
    adaptions of Gill Sans as the only model for sans serif lettering. Having said
    that, I doubt Wolpe would have needed any reference material to do this.
