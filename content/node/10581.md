  bookshops or antiquarians that might be interesting to visit for a typography addict
  and design junkie? Or any other nice places to go besides the obvious &#40;MoMA
  etc.&#41;?

  body: When will you be there? July 20-24 is TypeCon which would certainly satisfy
    your type/design itch. At the TypeCon planning meeting there was talk of organizing
    some typographic tours. Grolier club, Subway, Press shops etc. Even if you aren&#39;t
    in NYC during typecon, check out their calendar for ideas, they may also have
    &#34;things to do and see&#34; info. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typecon.com"

  body: Kaizer, one place to visit is the Empire State Building and the Crysler Building
    &#40;nice Art Deco&#41;, also visit Central Park. When you get into Central Park
    &#40;on the park drives&#41; and want to know where you are look at the light
    poles, they give you the nearest cross street, like W7201, West 72nd street number
    1 light pole.

    <BR> <BR>Pretty much everything you need. &#40;You can skip the visit to Duggal,
    it&#39;s just a fancy place for burning CDs&#41;.'

  body: I would suggest Dean &amp; Deluca for food/packaging. <BR>I would suggest
    Takashimaya for presentation and interiors. <BR>I would suggest Rizzoli&#39;s
    bookstore on 57th &#40;right?&#41; for that wonderful old bookstore smell.

    to recommend Zabar's (2245 Boadway @ 80th Street) for good coffee, delicious chocolate
    rugelach, and the cheapest souvenir mugs on Manhattan!\r\n\r\n"
