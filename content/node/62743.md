    on A in the first sample?

    have only used the best stone cutters for that work. I'll be there was a lot of
    other stuff done by hacks who didn't finish their full apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n\"Why
    should I pay a stone cutter 100 drachmas to carve Grandpa's tombstone. I have
    a chisel. I'll do it myself for free.\""

  body: "I have to admit that I prefer a lot of this sort of vernacular lettering
    to the imperial monumental inscriptions \xE0 la Trajan's column. The letters in
    the latter are magnificent but frankly the overall impact is massively dull: like
    most authoritarian design it lacks the human dimension. There's a liveliness in
    Antonio's far from perfect examples that the more famous monumental inscriptions
    lack."
