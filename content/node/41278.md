body: "A year ago I read about a font that truncated the spelling of words to mimic
  the abbreviated spelling that you often find in text messages and instant messaging.
  For example, this font would truncate \"Vancouver\" to \"Vncvr\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  was this font?\r\n\r\nWas it a Spiekermann design?"

    download from Fontshop. The font is actually FF Meta without some vowels."

    there are vowels in FF Mt, but they are only as small caps at x-height."
