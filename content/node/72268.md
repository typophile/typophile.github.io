  body: "Apple uses the same parts, and to some extent, the same internal hardware
    designs, as every other laptop vendor. There are really only four laptop makers
    in the world, all run out of Hong Kong and/or Taiwan. All of their designs are
    variations on each other, they all use the same suppliers and contractors, etc.
    Companies like Dell and Apple just pick a stock mainboard and have it slightly
    modified for whatever controls and ports their American designers want to wrap
    around it.\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m not surprised that my luck with Powerbooks has been
    just as bad as my luck with PC laptops was. This laptop\u2019s CD/DVD drive has
    never worked right, the first battery developed a defect, the replacement has
    since done the same. The only real advantage to Apple hardware is that you can
    pay extra for Applecare, which gives you three years to walk into the Apple store
    and get fast service for just about any of the defects in Apple\u2019s cheap Asian
    hardware.\r\n\r\nI buy Apple computers because I like being able to run on a fairly
    solid UNIX OS and because Microsoft\u2019s GUI designers are even worse than Apple\u2019s.
    But I\u2019m never buying another overpriced Powerbook. Next time I\u2019m going
    to just build my own desktop and run Hackintosh on it."

    The Dell contracted service guy came on over, spent a morning fixing one problem
    and diagnosing another. Then Dell couriered a brand new monitor to me that arrived
    the next morning, and arranged pick-up of the old one.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature

    a sound investment and well worth the extra money, regardless of whether you're

    alright, usually. They had their batch of problematic products too, cracking top-board
    of the old white mac-book, heat issues due to wrongfully applied thermal-paste,
    display issues with the iMac, so they are not manufacturing miracle-machines.
    \r\n\r\nOn the other hand their built quality recently increased again I think,
    with the new uni-body lineup. In general there were some issues after the intel-switch.
    Anyhow, you will definitely be at least on the same level as with a general Windows
    laptop (I am sure there are some outstanding Win laptops too). \r\n\r\nI had three
    macs, and only good experiences with the Apple service. The old white macbook
    was a bit problematic for me, because I needed to get the display (flickering)
    and the keyboard-unit/top-case (cracks) exchanged on warranty. But it still runs
    great actually, considering that I dropped the whole thing from a meter and a
    half on the floor (It was due to a wrongly zipped backpack)! The display was broken,
    but I was able to change the display myself following the instructions of ifixit
    (It is the third screen in the same laptop already). Generally the limited variety
    of products can be a plus too, because parts are easier available, same with instructions.
    Plus if a line of products has a series problem you hear quite fast about it.
    With Windows-laptop manufactures you normally have 50 different laptops in the
    line-up, so news travels slower I guess.\r\n\r\nI have the 13 inch MacBook Pro,
    mine is a year old already though. A friend of mine uses it for design work with
    Photoshop and an external monitor, she says CS5 performs better on a mac than
    CS4. She uses Photoshop. I am not sure if Video-Editing would be something advisable,
    other than that CS should be fine, if you use an external display. \r\n\r\nFor
    the value of money a hackintosh would be the smartest thing. In some EU countries
    this probably would be legal even, if you were you have the OS DVD, if you did
    not download a modified OS, but just the drivers and kernel-extensions. I am not
    sure how feasible this is, but I just want to point out that in some countries
    the use of the OS is less restricted and it is more seen under the aspect of property
    than license, than in others. This has to do with the non-applicablitiy of EULAs,
    which are not accessible before the buy. It doesn't mean that you own the code,
    but on your version of what you bought you can modify for your own use whatever
    you want, depending on the country."

    got back to him. :) Maybe things have changed since. \r\n\r\nI still plan on getting

    Windows actually handles multitasking with multiple cores better. I currently
    have open: Illustrator, Dreamweaver, InDesign, Photoshop, Suitcase Fusion 2, MediaMonkey
    (audio program), Steam (video game launching program) and some other miscellaneous
    things, and I can switch between one and the other seamlessly. In Windows 7.\r\n\r\nTo
    be honest, I would only buy Dell's high-end laptops. Sony and ASUS are better
    options, and don't cost a fortune to upgrade RAM as with Apple.\r\n\r\nAlso, what
    James Puckett mentioned isn't quite true, either: <em>If you aren\u2019t doing

    statement was too generic. If you aren't doing motion or 3d, then a superpowered
    video card isn't necessary. \"CPU options\" are everything in this matter. RAM
    doesn't do processing, it allows more memory for the CPU to work with. The key
    is to have a good amount of quality RAM <em>and</em> a powerful processor.\r\n\r\nTake
    this into consideration, as well:\r\n\r\n2.66 i7 CPU\r\n8GB DDR3 RAM\r\n500GB
    Hard Drive\r\n17\" Screen\r\nApple's Cost: $2900.00\r\nASUS: $1450.00\r\n\r\nThat's
    double the price. ASUS's also comes with a better video card, 1yr accidental warranty,
    2 year parts & labor warranty, and an extendable warranty.\r\n\r\nBut, overall,
    I do love Apple's design. That's where they have always trumped other brands."

    if you're doing motion or 3D, chances are you'll be working in a low quality/res
    or wireframe mode anyway. All of the fancy 3D stuff like raytracing, GI, SSS,
    volumetrics, motion blur, and whatnot come in when it's time to render...which
    happens on the CPU and in memory.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I can vouch for my satisfaction
    with my MacBookPro, although it's one of the older ones (got it summer of '07).
    I have experienced some logic board issues and I had one of those creepy Sony
    (IIRC) batteries, but the service was excellent. The OS has only ever crashed
    maybe once or twice, and I only ever shut it down when I need to get on an airplane.
    Most of the time it just stays on, and if I need to move it I'll put it to sleep.
    As far as multitasking, as I said, I really think it depends on the app. I can
    run Nuke, Final Cut Pro, and ZBrush all at once with no issues. Open one too many
    tab in Safari, though, and it dies... *sigh*"
