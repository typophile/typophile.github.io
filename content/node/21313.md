  and the \"sony style\" part is probably custom -- but, if anyone can get a definite
  id, I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAmy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sonystylelogo_6051.gif]"

  body: "Didn't our own Miles [[Newlyn]] have some involvement with updating the Sony
    brand? Or was that Honda? Another Japanese company with a slab serif wordmark.\r\n\r\nSlightly
    OT his site at <a href=\"http://www.newlyn.com/\" target=\"new\">newlyn.com</a>
    seems to be down. I tried yesterday as well, I was looking for confirmation on
    the Newlyn connection with the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/21295\" target=\"new\">Hutch</a>
    logo.\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n\r\n"
