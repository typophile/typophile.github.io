  the word \"ONE\" in a bold geometric sans, with a numeral 1 in the center of the
  \"O\". I can't remember who has used a logo like this.\r\n\r\nI;m working on a logo
  at work, and want to avoid it looking the logo I've seen before. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    one I'm thinking of. The one I'm thinking of was probably music or TV related.\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"
