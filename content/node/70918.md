  body: You're welcome! I hope the Dutch website makes sense enough to place an order.
    So Michael, you're interested in our Dutch musician? :-)

  body: "He, along with Andrea Bocelli, did one of the best duets ever. Borsato has
    an amazing voice. I could listen to him all day.\r\n\r\nMusic is my muse! I was
    enthralled by the theatrics of the concert... and the duets were incredible. He
    alone is wonderful also.\r\n\r\nAmazing!"

  body: Funny. I wonder how he got known abroad as it's mainly Dutch was he's singing.
    We have way better export recently, by the way ;-) Lots of good artists are popping
    up these days!
