  body: "Thanks guys these are all good typeface recommendations.  Its seems trying
    to find a good \"S\" is hard to come by or maybe I am just not paying attention
    to what is a good looking \"S\".  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way is there anything
    similar to ARS Maquette but with italics?\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI
    know I am in my own little world, but its ok.  They know me here"
