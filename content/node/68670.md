body: I always preview before I post, and I think I discovered another bug. Even if
  a link is broken, it still previews blue, thus giving a false impression that it's
  coded correctly.

  body: "The syntax for <code>A</code> (anchor) is <code>&lt;a&gt;</code><em>your
    anchor content</em><code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.\r\nNot all anchors are hyperlinks,
    though. You can turn an anchor into a hyperlink by adding the <code>href</code>
    attribute; full syntax then is <code>&lt;a href=\"</code><em>your url</em><code>\"&gt;</code><em>your
    anchor content</em><code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>."

  body: "Mark is incorrect. <code>a:link</code> matches hypertext links only in CSS
    and can thus differentiate <code>A HREF</code> from <code>A ID</code>. It\u2019s
    a question of CSS, not HTML, and no, it isn\u2019t true that nothing can be done."
