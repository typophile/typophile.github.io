body: "EDIT: because there is not a lot of information about how to create a flipper
  font, below is a step-to-step guide for FontLab. I hope people with no background
  knowledge, and with the same questions as me can find some answers. My original
  message and questions about a flipper font are shown below.\r\n\r\nA flipper font
  is a font that has multiple variations of every character. These variations are
  alternately called upon to bring more variations inside the font. Example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1-Same_glyph_4820.jpg]\r\n\r\nthis
  is the default behaviour, on the keyboard the \u2018n\u2019 is ticked, and the same
  'n' is used again and again.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2-Changing_glyphs_4607.jpg]\r\n\r\nOn
  a flipper font however, when the key \u2018n\u2019 is pressed, there are variations
  on every glyph used, in this case, there are 10 variations on each character. When
  the 10th variation is used, it starts again with variation 1 etc.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nHow
  to create this in FontLab? The steps below are guidelines, as I find them the most
  easy way to do it. There are other possibilities and an other order is possible.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  in FontLab, design every character that is already there, and set its width etc.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3-Default_Window_3677.png]\r\n\r\nNext
  steps are creating the variations on every character. Do so by going to menu Glyph
  -> Generate glyphs. Type there: \u2018n.alt2 n.alt3 n.alt4 n.alt5 n.alt6 n.alt7
  n.alt8 n.alt9 n.alt10\u2019. This will create nine other versions of the character
  \u2018n\u2019. For creating variations for the other characters, replace the n with
  the other character name; example \u2018A.alt2 A.alt3 A.alt4 A.alt5 A.alt6 A.alt7
  A.alt8 A.alt9 A.alt10\u2019 do so with every character.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4-Generate_glyphs_5988.png]\r\n\r\nNote
  that the already designed basic-character is copied. I myself find that easy to
  work further on. Design each glyph as preferred. Make enough differences between
  every version of a character, otherwise a flipper font has no meaning.\r\n\r\nFor
  the coding part, open the panel in menu -> panels -> OpenType. There happens the
  OpenType code. The most basic code that can be used is:\r\n\r\npress the \u2018+\u2019
  button left below, and replace the appearing code by\r\n<code>feature aalt{\r\nfeature
  calt;\r\n} aalt;</code>\r\n\r\nAalt does mean \u2018Access All Alternates\u2019,
  and the list of features that follows are the special features that are used in
  this font. Here it is only calt (Contextual Alternates), which is used to get a
  flipper font working. A list of OpenType features can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list#OpenType_Typographic_Features\r\nPress
  the \u2018+\u2019 again, and replace the new code with:\r\n<code>feature calt {
  # contextual Alternates \r\nsub n n' by n.alt2;\r\nsub n.alt2 n' by n.alt3;\r\nsub
  n.alt3 n' by n.alt4;\r\nsub n.alt4 n' by n.alt5;\r\nsub n.alt5 n' by n.alt6;\r\nsub
  n.alt6 n' by n.alt7;\r\nsub n.alt7 n' by n.alt8;\r\nsub n.alt8 n' by n.alt9;\r\nsub
  n.alt9 n' by n.alt10;\r\nsub n.alt10 n' by n;\r\n} calt;</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5-OpenType_code1_6001.png]\r\n\r\nWith
  this code, the \u2018n\u2019 starts to vary according to its position. Never there
  will be two times the same \u2018n\u2019 after each other, as in image 2. Note:
  everything after a \u2018#\u2019 is a reminder; it does nothing with the code, but
  it makes it easier to ad a note, and to understand what the code is doing. \r\nThis
  is the start of a flipper font. But doing this code for every character again is
  a lot of work. For making that easier there are classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classes
  panel can be found at menu Window->Panels->Classes.\r\nClasses are used to group
  glyphs of the same sort. The basic-characters are one class, the first variations
  (alternate 2 as I called them) are the next class, the second variation is class
  3, etc.\r\n\r\nCreate 10 classes on the left side of the panel.\r\nI myself prefer
  to give long names to classes. That way, in an comprehensive OpenType Font, with
  a lot of features and a long list of different names, it is easy to see what a class
  is, and what it does. My names are build as Class_calt, Class_alt2, Class_alt3,\u2026
  means: it is a class, and it contains alternates version X of the characters. And
  I let the numbering start with the first class, to have a structure.\r\nDrag and
  drop the glyphs in the right class; the result should be as next:\r\n\r\n<code>Class_calt
  \   -all the normal glyphs\r\nClass_alt2    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt2\r\nClass_alt3
  \   -all the glyphs with suffix .alt3\r\nClass_alt4    -all the glyphs with suffix
  .alt4\r\nClass_alt5    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt5\r\nClass_alt6    -all the
  glyphs with suffix .alt6\r\nClass_alt7    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt7\r\nClass_alt8
  \   -all the glyphs with suffix .alt8\r\nClass_alt9    -all the glyphs with suffix
  .alt9\r\nClass_alt10  -all the glyphs with suffix .alt10</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6-Classes_5519.png]\r\n\r\nNow
  this work is done, the code in the OpenType panel has to be changed.\r\n\r\nReplace
  our previous code:\r\n<code>feature calt { # contextual Alternates \r\nsub n n'
  by n.alt2;\r\nsub n.alt2 n' by n.alt3;\r\nsub n.alt3 n' by n.alt4;\r\nsub n.alt4
  n' by n.alt5;\r\nsub n.alt5 n' by n.alt6;\r\nsub n.alt6 n' by n.alt7;\r\nsub n.alt7
  n' by n.alt8;\r\nsub n.alt8 n' by n.alt9;\r\nsub n.alt9 n' by n.alt10;\r\nsub n.alt10
  n' by n;\r\n} calt;</code>\r\n\r\nwith next code:\r\n<code>feature calt { # contextual
  Alternates \r\nsub @class_calt @class_calt' by @class_alt2;\r\nsub @class_alt2 @class_calt'
  by @class_alt3;\r\nsub @class_alt3 @class_calt' by @class_alt4;\r\nsub @class_alt4
  @class_calt' by @class_alt5;\r\nsub @class_alt5 @class_calt' by @class_alt6;\r\nsub
  @class_alt6 @class_calt' by @class_alt7;\r\nsub @class_alt7 @class_calt' by @class_alt8;\r\nsub
  @class_alt8 @class_calt' by @class_alt9;\r\nsub @class_alt9 @class_calt' by @class_alt10;\r\nsub
  @class_alt10 @class_calt' by @class_calt;\r\n} calt;</code>\r\nSo in stead of working
  with each individual character, the code is looking into the classes. That saves
  writing some thousand lines of code. This new code with the classes makes the flipping
  character-independent. Not only if two times the same character follows at each
  other, as in the example with the 'n', but with every new character the font will
  take a contextual alternate.\r\n\r\nGenerate the font as OpenType, so the code is
  also exported.\r\nCurrently most professional programs are compatible with this
  sort of type.\r\nTest it. It is easy to overlook a mistake.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19625\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43634\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13315\r\nhttp://blog.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/post/238296379/how-to-add-opentype-alternates-in-fontlab\r\nTypophile\r\nAnd

  MESSAGE:\r\nThe context of this question is one of my experiments\r\nto create a
  good legible font (NOT such a comic font) that is very readable on little formats.\r\nTo
  simulate a sense of  handwriting, it has to be a flipper font.\r\nI want to look
  if it is possible to combine, and how far it is possible to go with.\r\n\r\nI thought
  I was smart enough to figure out how it had to be done in FontLab\r\nbut thanks
  to my limited knowledge of the English language, I'm not.\r\nAlso I have only a
  limited knowledge of FontLab, my previous fonts were without programming Python.\r\n(I
  actually know FontLab only one year now, and on school the specialization Typography
  is in its childhood,\r\nnot a lot of people know FontLab in detail)\r\n\r\nI'm very
  interested in this part of fonts, but it would be stupid having to learn Python
  for one exercise,\r\nI can better learn it later when I have more time.\r\nSo my
  question is; can someone link to, or provide a step by step way how to create flipper
  fonts in FontLab?\r\nStarting with how to create multiple versions of one glyph
  (and the correct name it has to be given)\r\nover how to write and insert the Python
  code,\r\nand if needed, how to export it the correct way.\r\n\r\nI have found the
  code, but don't know how to implement it.\r\n<code>\r\nfeature salt {\r\nlookup
  rotate {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub @set_2 @set_1' by @set_3;\r\nsub
  @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1' by @set_5;\r\nsub @set_5 @set_1'
  by @set_1;\r\n} rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n} salt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI have done
  a search around, but couldn't find something easy;\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19625\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43634\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13315\r\nEven
  Google didn't give an easy answer.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry my first post has to be such
  an stupid easy thing, but so it be.\r\nI think Typophile is the best place to ask
  this,\r\nhere I have found already a lot of information about font designing problems
  in the past.\r\nI'm glad if someone could tell me.\r\nMaarten"

  body: "@ JamesM: A flipper font is a font with every character multiple times, with
    in every version of that character (little) differences. This is done so there
    is more variation in the text.\r\nThe program is detecting that a character is
    used, and then uses the next version, and then the version thereafter till they
    are all used. Then it starts again.\r\n\r\n@ Nick Shinn: thanks for the reply.\r\nHowever,
    flipper fonts are not freeware (I didn't find one). Otherwise I had done it that
    way.\r\nFor this very little schoolproject, I'm not gona buy it (nor steal nor
    ask to give one illegal)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm hoping I have it in some days, with some
    help from somebody.\r\nWhen we get the code to work, I will post the steps here."
