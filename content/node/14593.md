  mine:\r\n\r\n<br><br>Need to learn QuarkXPress for your job? Need to update your
  page layout skills?\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nIf you enjoy online communities, this

  with over ten years of experience with QuarkXPress, you will work on individual
  and group projects, on your own time! \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no less expensive
  or more thorough instruction in QuarkXPress available in the Bay Area.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nFor

    first class is given. Why didn't you post this class in June? I mean give yourself
    some lead time. Now that its late, post when you have other classes in the making,
    so a potential student can PLAN to attend your group. \r\n\r\nAnother thought,
    you might also add an InDesign class to your group. "

  body: "Dan,\r\n\r\nI understand your point about giving students lead time. For
    some, this an issue, for some, it is not.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: the first meeting
    is on <strong>Saturday</strong>, not Wednesday. The second - and last - meeting
    is in Decemeber. This is an <strong>online</strong> class. Both meetings are optional.\r\n\r\nTo
    answer your question, I didn't think I'd <strong>have</strong> to advertise! I
    am a little low on students. But actually, I have advertised earlier, just not
    here.\r\n\r\nAnd to answer the second point, we will have a complete InDesign
    class very soon. Currently, we have an \"InDesign for QuarkXPress Users\" class
    (which is face-to-face).\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest,\r\n\r\nAmy"
