  I might as well make the break now, and surely the new stuff has some features I'll
  like. My initial looks haven't impressed me a lot, but I'm hoping one will grow
  on me?\r\n\r\nDo the latest Windows versions of either FontExplorer or Suitcase
  (or both) import ATM Deluxe font sets?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    no words. I don't know the correct terminology, but I think you'll know what I'm
    saying. It was a big mess. I don't recommend that at all.\r\n\r\nI'm using a program
    called Typograf that manages according to folders you create so if you pointed
    it to your ATM folders, it should work. It doesn't have the most elegant interface
    in the world but it works very well. I like that I can put shortcuts to font groups
    on my desktop. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.neuber.com/typograph\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n"

  body: "Sharon: ATM and most higher end font managers have sets that do not necessarily
    correspond to physical folders. So I need to have something read the set info,
    not just look at folders. At least, that's my hope.  :)\r\n\r\nBut thanks for
    the suggestion.\r\n\r\nI seem to recall that I looked at Typograf a while back,
    and I really didn't like the UI at all. But at least it handles all the font formats
    I care about, which is more than one can say for most of the less-well-known competitors
    to Suitcase and FontExplorer.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "The UI is strange at first. I had used Suitcase for years so it looked primitive
    in comparison. But it is far more flexible than Suitcase and has more features.
    \r\n\r\nI looked at a lot so I hope you find one that suits you. It isn't easy
    to do on a Windows machine.\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n "

    quite pleased with High-Logic's <a href="http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html">MainType</a>.

  body: "When Suitcase X1 for Mac OS was released there were many Mac users left behind
    by the lack of ATM on OS X. Extensis did actually create a utility to import this
    data for Mac users because there was significant demand. It only really worked
    for people upgrading from System 9 to system 10, not a clean install. \r\n\r\nCurrently,
    I'm not aware of any other customers asking for this functionality on Windows,
    although there must be some. My guess is that it is partly due to slow Vista adoption
    in professional publishing environments.  In addition, it probably wouldn't be
    practical for people migrating from one PC to another. \r\n\r\nFor things like
    this to happen, my guess is that there would need to be a lot of demand, or it
    would need to be easy to implement. For example, if ATM's database structure was
    clearly documented, a hobbyist my step up to the plate. Currently Suitcase for
    Windows is not scriptable, which means that a Suitcase import couldn't be fully
    automated. However, Suitcase for Windows does use Font Sense to identify fonts
    clearly. So, if a user exports sets into folders from another font manager, they
    can import them into Suitcase without generating dupes. This means basically dragging
    folders of fonts into the sets pane to create sets. If the same exact font is
    in multiple folders only one copy of the font will go into the Vault. I haven't
    used ATM in a while, so I'm don't recall how easy it is to collect fonts into
    folders.\r\n\r\nIn future font management products, I'd really like to have a
    clean reliable way to import/export data. With Font Sense IDs, this would open
    up a lot of opportunities because each font can be globally identified. "

  body: "Forcing the folder structure to match a sets structure is not an option.
    Among other things, the same font can be (often/usually is) in multiple sets.
    Copying all the fonts to a vault is an option, but not an option I like. I want
    to maintain my own organization of physical fonts, and have them independent of
    the sets.\r\n\r\nATM Deluxe has a feature to \"export sets\" to a plain text file.
    This enables one to simply recreate the same sets on another computer. It is AFAIK
    quite independent of the physical locations of the fonts. The format probably
    isn't documented, but it's pretty darn obvious and doesn't really need documentation.\r\n\r\nI'm
    just not getting why a modern font manager would even care about the physical
    location of the fonts, except for them being in a system fonts locaiton. Font
    Reserve created the \"vault\" idea back in Mac OS 7 days, mostly because font
    corruption was a big problem on classic Macs. It's not much of an issue today.\r\n\r\nFont
    Sense or other reliable font ID systems are a great idea, but for my purposes
    just using the PostScript FontName is good enough as far as reconstructing my
    sets. That and the Windows menu names are in the exported ATM font set file.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I'm starting to feel like I'm ranting, which is not a good sign. I appreciate
    that folks have been willing to share their info and thoughts.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
