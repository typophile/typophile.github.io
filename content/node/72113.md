  body: There are similarities, but it's quite different - take the 'a' for example.
    It's a lot wider too

  body: "The sample of Bernase Roman shown on that other thread shows an 'a' with
    that shape. The way film types were used, as I understand it, they could be distorted
    using lenses to make them shorter, longer, slanted, etc. So those proportions
    should not detract from the fact that the basic shapes of all the letters in your
    sample seem to match letters available in Bernase Roman. The only other typeface
    that has much similarity is Romana, but it has more differences than Bernase.
    I think Florian's saying 'Similar to ITC Bernase' is a good way to express that
    this looks like a slightly customized version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, apologies, yes, I see the alternate 'a' now.\r\nIt looks like Opti
    may have pirated ITC Bernase, widened it and released it as OPTI Danley (Bold).\r\n"
