  if it was legal at all to take a font file, export a handful of characters from
  it and use it on a website? To be clear, I'm talking about commercial fonts like
  \"Century Gothic\", for example, and by \"use it on a website\", I mean hosting
  a 5-character font file and distributing it to visitors to the site.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPS:
  Can you recommend any good font editors/creators for Linux? Cheers."
