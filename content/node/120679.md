body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic design newbie working on a school assignment,
  and would need a little help with pairing fonts. I'm looking for a paragraph typeface
  that would go with the font that I'm going to use in the headlines, Goudy Bookletter
  1911 (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Goudy-Bookletter-1911). The paragraph typeface
  could be simpler and more modern than the headline font. It would also need to be
  a very basic font, as I cannot really install anything on the computer. I myself
  am quite fond of Caslon, but I think it clashes somehow... Thanks in advance for
  your help!"

  body: Hi, thank you for the suggestion! I welcome all help, be it expert or not.
    :) Cheltenham light could work, but the thing is, I can't install any new fonts
    on the computer I'm working on... I'm also looking for something slightly simpler
    (althoug I'm not sure if there are any matches among contemporary typefaces...).

    know what's installed on that particular computer...\r\n\r\nBy the way, you can
    try a geometric sans."

    a dangerous suggestion :) Especially until we know what\u2019s installed on that
    machine. If it\u2019s Century Gothic or so, maybe not a good idea.\r\n\r\nTo the
    original poster: Please post a list of the fonts you can choose from."

    You're of course right, Nina. \r\nI managed to forgot the specifics of the request
    and assumed the needed pairing would use Goudy for the body."

  body: "Hi, sorry, I assumed that there is a default set of fonts installed on a
    basic PC... Out of the ones I know are used for big amounts of text, I have at
    least Caslon, Garamond, Baskerville, Palatino Linotype, Minion Pro, but then again
    not Bembo, Janson or Sabon. If there's any way to find a complete list of the
    fonts installed on the computer, please tell me and I'll post a list - now I could
    only find an app that told me that there are 306 fonts installed, and I don't
    think it makes sense to start listing them here one by one. (I'm not a pro with
    computers either...)\r\n"

    can access it, the system-wide font folder should be accessible from there.

  body: Thank you! I found the folder, but don't know if it contains a list of fonts,
    as I just saw the icons for each font (I still think it would be quite a lot of
    work to copypaste the name of each font here individually). Maybe it would be
    easiest to attach a screenshot of the InDesign font menu?
