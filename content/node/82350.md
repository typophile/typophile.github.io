  is casually/generally mentioned which member of Helvetica readily comes to mind?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI think I've seen that in use quit a bit throughout the fashion
    industry. The mention of Ultralight (and now I'm also thinking it's Thin cousin
    too) might just be another way I'm going to go with my designs for some old skool
    bling knuckle jewelry.\r\n\r\nMy Helvetica knuckle jewelry designs originally
    I had gem stone fill set inside the letter shapes of 75 Bold or Std Black, but
    now I'll also do one with gem stones going around Ultralight/Light or even 33Thin
    letter shapes.\r\n\r\nHelvetica knuckle jewelry coming soonish like.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again :)   "
