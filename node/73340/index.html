  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>For my Expletus Text (check the critique forum) I used the optical spacing function in inDesign, but it looked a bit tight so I added 10. At 12 pts this looks perfect, but at 8 it&rsquo;s way to tight. If I had to choose one point size to decide my spacing issue upon I&rsquo;d choose 10pnts, but anyhow I think it&rsquo;s also very suit for logo&rsquo;s, which are bigger and thus need looser spacing. Is there anything I can do about this, or is it up to the designer to add increase the spacing if needed? What is the most common text-size?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jasper de Waard</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your comment oldnick. The delicate gaps get lost at text-sizes anyway, but I still like it without the gaps. Have you printed the pdf and do you judge it no good for anything under 12 pnts or do you guess so because of the delicate design? I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you, but if you haven&rsquo;t yet, I think you should print the pdf to be able to judge it properly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my [[http://markbattypublisher.com/books/typography-monographs-volume-2-size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs-an-investigation-of-the-principles-guiding-the-design-of-optical-sizes/|book about optical sizes]] there is also short chapter on spacing. This is what I found out in my research:</p>
<p><cite>The ideal spacing for a certain design and size is influenced by several factors: the optical resolution of human perception, crowding, rhythm and, in the large sizes, the specific situation and taste. In very small sizes the minimum space between the letters is determined by the distance that is required in order to recognize two objects as separate, as explained in section 4.1. Furthermore, adding spacing helps reduce the effects of crowding. In the large sizes, however, the tightness of the setting is not limited by these perceptual factors.
Another guideline is that the space between the letters should be in a harmonious relation to the space within: “Spacing and width go hand in hand” (Slimbach 2007). If the letters are set too tightly the counters become bigger than the inter-letter space, which looks inharmonious. The collective opinion on how tight the setting can be without looking congested seems to change over the decades, however. In the 1970s and 1980s it was not uncommon to set type in display sizes far more closely than would be considered acceptable today. Sometimes even professional typographers do not agree on the ideal amount of space between the letters. Unger (2007b) reports that his standard fitting of his Gulliver was considered too tight by Spiekermann whereas a newspaper that intended to use it was envisaging even tighter setting than Unger’s default.
The situation in which the type is used is another factor that determines the spacing. If the fonts are to be used predominantly in rather loose layouts like books the default spacing should be looser than, for example, in fonts for newspaper headlines, where the typographers generally prefer tight setting. On the other hand, if type is set vertically or inverted, the spacing has to be increased significantly (Forssman et al. 2004).
Fortunately, the overall tracking can be adjusted by the typographer to suit the specific needs. In case optical sizes are not available this is the only size dependent aspect the typographer can improve. However, as Biľak (2007) points out, many type users are not aware of the necessity of this adjustment so specialised fonts with built-in tracking adjustment are a sensible means to make sure the type is appropriately spaced, especially if it is not expected to be used only by expert typographers. In this context it is astonishing that many digital designs do not make use of this opportunity at all. On the other hand, it should be kept in mind that similar spacing for all fonts facilitates their comparison, which is helpful if the most appropriate master has to be chosen for an in-between size where two masters come into question.
Friedrich Forssman et al. (2004) show a list which serves as a guideline when working with single master fonts (Fig. 44) and could provide a basis for manually tuned size variants. For typefaces that show adaptations only in details a general increase of spacing can serve as a starting point (Schwartz 2007, Crossgrove 2007, Smeijers 2007). However, global increase of tracking can result in “overly loose rounds, or serifs that are too far apart” (Schwartz 2007), which then require manual adjustments. According to Crossgrove (2007), “intricate shapes like s, E, g or combinations like PA and Tv really look very different at different sizes”. If the glyphs show a significantly different design the spacing must be worked out from scratch for each size (Kobayashi 2007, Porchez 2007). This corresponds with Biľak’s (2007) and Karow’s (1998) conviction that not only spacing but also kerning needs to be size-specific.</cite></p>
