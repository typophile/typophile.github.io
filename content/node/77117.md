  a banner for a band's myspace and website. They're bluesy, contemporary, and young.
  They have this older kick ass soul singer. The name is \"Brownish Black.\" Any suggestions?
  Ideally with the \"B\" being the main feature.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRollin"

    points in this font. I don''t think it really fits the feel, but it will be impossible
    for me not to try a few examples with it. Thanks.'

  body: "@T\xE9 Rowan Odd.. I like the insane uppercase A and B but overall it seems
    like it comes from a style derived not from 'round here (USA). Blues is 'Merican
    born ya know? The lowercase w throws me off. But, I'll fool around with it and
    see what it does. Thanks!"

    nothing spectacular about the \"B\", but it might be what you want."

  body: I think the Brownish Black name is a stinker and you should reconsider. Believe
    me, I know how hard it is to come up with a name for a band, I've done the band
    and club circuit for years when I was younger, but Brownish Black has nothing
    going for it. Forget finding a font, find a new name!
