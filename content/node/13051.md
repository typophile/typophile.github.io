  gotic ornamented Initialls, or not only initialls but lower case too, I don\xB4t
  have an example but they were used in manual books written in the middle age \r\n\r\nThank
  you all very much and sorry if my english is not very accurate"

  body: Hi Tebo. You try looking at http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis where there
    is a collection of gothic and blackletter fonts - many of them are historic revivals
    created by people who do it as a pastime. This is not the same as going to a commercial
    foundry.

  body: "<a href=\"http://dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=404\">Dafont</a> also have some
    ornamental initials, but for medieval illuminated style I think you will have
    to draw them yourself from scratch a good place to look is <a href=\"http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=011ADD000049999U00043000&largeimage=1#largeimage\">the

    visiting a site devoted to Gothic, Celtic and Medieval ornamental initials, illuminated
    initials, replica fonts and more. I will try to find it again.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    here are a few more useful links:\r\nhttp://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/medieval/\r\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/la/bryde/fonts.html\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    them for a work at university, i\xB4ll post the image when it\xB4s ready for you
    to check it ;) \r\nThe only problem i have it\xB4s with purchasable font, because
    here it really expansive to buy hone, imagine the you pay them between 20-40 dollars,
    here The Peso Argentino it 1-3 so instead of costing me 40 it costs 120!!! that\xB4s
    a lot of money!!! hehe\r\nbut we\xB4ll see, thank you again\r\n\r\nTebo - Argentina"
