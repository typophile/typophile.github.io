  I love this typeface. Does anyone know what it is? The scan is crappy because it
  was embossed with a laser coating (I can't remember what that type of printing is
  called).\r\n\r\nAny help would be great! Thank you!\r\n\r\n-SW"

    dying to know what typeface this is. It's making me mental! The poster was designed
    by Helicopter. I might have to suck it up and just ask them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
