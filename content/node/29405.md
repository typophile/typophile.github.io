body: Is there a good alternate color swatch vendor for process swatches? I'm constantly
  running into problems with Pantone's swatches just not covering a lot of the Orange,
  Pink, Red, etc. colors that are possible in modern four-color printing but not represented
  in my Pantone swatches. Anyone have a recommendation?

    Books), that show more combinations...

    the difference between process and spot colour?\r\n\r\nThe Pantone process book
    I have here certainly doesn't seem to have any gaps in the brighter colours."

  body: Orange is a very difficult color to match in process. Even if you did find
    a book which had full-chroma Orange I would make a guess that it is because of
    the separate CMY inks which were used. This is part of the reason why the hexachrome
    process was developed, AFAIR, to enable richer process colors with the additional
    hits of color. Reds and Pinks suffer the same, just as blue does. They are only
    using 2 of the colors (mostly) to make the color and so aren't as rich on the
    page. The best thing you can do is to continue to use Pantone but design around
    the shortcomings of the process. Get into bed, so to speak, with your printer
    and explain your concerns and see if they aren't willing to help you find a solution.
    Perhaps, once you've asked, they will tell you of the process they recommend.

  body: I understand all of the concepts at work here. It's just that Pantone's process
    swatches  don't display colors that, while difficult to produce, are by no means
    impossible to get in CMYK. So I'm looking for a set of swatches (or a book) that
    does.

  body: "Fair enough, but if it's something that might need special CMYK ink or particular
    paper to achieve then isn't it easiest to ask your printer to match against a
    Pantone anyway?\r\n\r\nAnd if you check the solid to process guide, you can determine
    which shades are likely to need attention."

    probably against their best interests.\r\nPrinters used to produce 4-colour sample
    books that they gave away to good customers, obviously not cheap to produce and
    not exhaustive (normally gradated on 10% changes). Ask your friendly neighbourhood
    printer they might produce one, some digital printers do as well, I have one on
    my desk. However, like Pantone books, the colours fade so a really old one will
    only have the cyan left. Double hitting can also improve your coverage \u2013
    a spot colour might prove cheaper in the end. I think Hexachrome was mainly introduced
    to correct the purple and orange problems of cmyk.\r\n\r\nTim"

    swatches. I think they're happy selling you whatever swatch book you want/need.
    ;o)\r\n\r\nI've never found Pantone's process books to necessarily be 'conservative'
    anymore than any other process swatch book. \r\n\r\nOne thing to do is if you
    have a favorite printer: the next time you do four-color work with them, print
    a bunch of swatches on the signature outside of the trim area. Make your own swatch
    book. The bonus is that it'll be tailored to your specific printer for you (plus,
    it'd be 'free')"
