  body: "With metal type (working backwards), the type sort was made by pouring molten
    metal into a mold affixed to a matrix, which was the piece that had a hollowed
    out letter shape, let's say a D.\r\nThat matrix with the hollowed out D was made
    by the craftsperson carving a D onto the end of a long piece of metal called the
    punch, and then striking that hardened metal punch into the softer metal. So the
    carving that the cutter does is a positive version of the D. (punch is positive,
    matrix is negative, type is positive again). \r\nNow imagine trying to cut a tiny
    D onto the end of a metal piece. With some skill it wouldn't be so difficult to
    carve the letter in from the sides, but how do you create a hold in the middle?
    \r\nThe solution is to create another punch for the punch - a \"counterpunch.\"
    That would be a long piece of metal carved with the shape of the hole in the D.
    It is then hardened and struck into the punch to create the negative shape, and
    then the rest of the carving from the outside can proceed. \r\nThe holes  and
    closed spaces are called counters because in metal type they were achieved by
    the punchcutter with a counterpunch.\r\nIf I'm remembering right, I learned this
    all from [[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-06-0|Fred Smeijers'
    <em>Counterpunch</em>]]."

  body: And (to take it even further) if you have a letter with a printed part between
    counters (say, an H), you might even make a counter-counterpunch. Carve an H crossbar
    on the counter-counterpunch, strike it into the counterpunch, carve the outside
    contours of the H counters on the counterpunch, strike it into the punch, carve
    the outside contours of the H, strike it into the matrix...

  body: "Huh. I always assumed it was short for \"counter form\" or \"counter shape\",
    which refers to the negative space in or around any form, whether it's a letter
    or a shape. I further assumed that the word \"counterpunch\" was derived from
    that word.\r\n\r\nI claim no authority on the topic, of course. I bet my art background
    influenced my thinking when considering etymologies in type."

  body: In my understanding the "counter" refers not to the opposition of positive
    and negative space on the two dimensional plane of the printed letter, but rather
    the opposition of direction that the counterpunch pushes the metal in depth in
    the process of making type.
