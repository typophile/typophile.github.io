body: I&#39;m really touched how much everyone liked typecon. It is truly amazing
  how this conference and organization has grown. For those of you who weren&#39;t
  at the first 2, &#40;I don&#39;t think anyone here except maybe Kent has,&#41; you
  wouldn&#39;t believe it. It used to be about 30 people gathered in a room talking
  about type, and then going out for Chinese food at a groovy Polynesian resturant.  <BR>
  <BR>Since this is my first foray into Typophile, I&#39;d like to say hello to everyone!
  I think that these forums are an excellent way to increase awarness and spread the
  good word about type. Again, I&#39;d like to add my 2 cents about how good TypeCon
  2003 was. My head&#39;s still spinning! <BR> <BR>Hello to all, and especially to
  Hrant, who doesn&#39;t deserve all the negative attention he receives.

    overwhelmed by what it has become. This conference is like crack for me and I
    cannot get enough of it! <BR> <BR>It was such a delight to see so many of you
    in my hometown and I&#39;m very much looking forward to seeing you all in SF if
    not sooner! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Hey Tony! You&#39;re still around!! That&#39;s great. Yeah, I was only at
    the first one, but I&#39;m glad <BR>to hear that the increase in numbers has apparently
    left TypeCon&#39;s great spirit intact. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s better these days.
    We beat most of the hordes back into their caves. The ones still in the open tend
    to stay quiet - like they always have when it comes to actually sharing knowledge
    of type! Darn shame, that part. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: This morning, while making my bed, I was thinking about the impossibility
    of even attempting to point out highlights for TypeCon. I did mention two above,
    but realized this morning, while showering, that those weren&#39;t the only highlights,
    and maybe not even the top two for the whole of the last few days. Maybe the top
    two if we are just thinking in terms on the presentations, but even still ...
    Every presentation that I attended left me with more questions and thoughts and
    inspiration.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been visually emotionally physically intellectually
    and even spiritually &#40;on some level&#41; saturated. I&#39;m sitting here trying
    to organize my day realizing that I can&#39;t because I&#39;m already going through
    withdrawals.

    posting a non-st bride alert email. . . . <BR> <BR>i must agree with everyone&#39;s
    rave reviews about the conference this year - it was a truly wonderful few days.
    it&#39;s great to see typography escaping the stuffy academic approach and moving
    towards a truly accessible environment. [it was also a new experience to be surrounded
    by people my own age - and younger!] <BR> <BR>my only complaint, if one could
    even call it that, is that both the type blog panel and the education panel had
    better plan longer time slots for next year - we were just starting to get into
    the good stuff when the time was up. <BR> <BR>so yes, dyana has some serious swing
    in her hips, keith has a way with napkins, and stephen is the man for all hours
    card games. <BR> <BR>[hopefully] see you all next year, i&#39;m going back to

  body: Rather than repeat everything that has already been said, I&#39;ll simply
    add that typecon was an invigorating break from the solitude of writing code,
    designing fonts, and job searching in my office/bedroom in St. Paul. It was great
    to meet so many of you. I&#39;ll be counting the days until Typecon 2004. Us locals
    should get together for a drink now and then.

    first, but I&#39;ve been at every Con since. Things were really quaint the second
    year, not much different from the first &#40;from what I understand&#41;. Things
    really took a leap forward when you took it on, Tony, and moved things to Rochester.
    And it just keeps getting better and better. My only fear is that it&#39;ll get
    too big and we&#39;ll lose the intimacy. I think this year was just about perfect.'
