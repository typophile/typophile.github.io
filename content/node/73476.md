body: "Heyo!\r\n\r\nI'm designing an identity for a small internet-based writing/blogging
  business run by four strong, yet fashionable women with great taste and I'm looking
  for some possible typeface suggestions for a logo.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThey are going
  to be writing about fashion, fine dining, consumer goods and similar topics in a
  space  that's \u2026er male-heavy.\r\n\r\nThe face should be strong, yet feminine.
  Somewhat of a classic that feels trustworthy and wise, but also has a touch of sass
  and knows how to party (or even better\u2026 throw a party). This party would have
  wine, flavoured martinis, expensive cake, tapas, and casual designer clothing. They
  would talk of art, popular music, twitter, contemporary fashion, and possibly even
  a little Futurama. The party would start at 10pm in Montreal and the hosts would
  be female, but anyone's invited\u2026 if you're cool enough. Think Mad Men meets
  Sex in the City. \r\n\r\nThe name of the business is quite masculine, but fun in
  a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. I'd like to contrast it with something non-masculine.\r\n\r\nI'm
  leaning towards a serif, but am definitely open to a sans, slab, or even (cautiously)
  a thick, sturdy script of some kind. Preferably something from the 60's (or even
  influenced by faces of the 60's).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "@Nick Shinn Awe come on, Nick. You don't think any of this aligns with your
    own personal typographic ideologies? Not even just a hint of Sex in the City?
    ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nKidding aside, I am actually looking for something a little more
    classic. I don't want people to actually think these people <em>are</em> Mad Men
    meets Sex in the City. To compare using fluffy entertainment and is probably selling
    them way short (they are quite brilliant people). Which might be why I'm having
    trouble zeroing in on an appropriate typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks for the early suggestions!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Great description. Makes me think of <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/detail.php?fontname=jeanne\">Jeanne
    Moderno</a>, which strikes me as classic but different, and feminine in a strong/rigid
    way.\r\nAlso look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_pitu_ot/\">FF
    Pitu</a>, maybe that's too sharp tho, but definitely classy and very sexy.\r\nA
    softer, sort of classic solution could be <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=109\">Mrs
    Eaves</a>, but you don't want to don't use that for anything longer than a wordmark
    (where you would manually kern it)."

    thank you!\r\n\r\nI'm especially loving Eames Century Modern. What a beautiful
    collection. It seems to be very fitting in terms of the historical influences
    and the aesthetic I'm going for. Thank you, all about seb!\r\n\r\nAlso a big fan
    of Feijoa and Jeanne Moderno. They might be good backups to experiment with if
    necessary. "

    might also like <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034\">Sentinel</a>
    (which might be a bit more masculine); maybe also check out <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/parry_grotesque_professional_ot/\">Parry</a>
    (which is a bit softer / more playful). "

  body: "<cite>\"In my ideology, those terms are not mutually exclusive\"</cite>\r\nUm,
    not in mine either. But I too have found that stating them like this often helps
    in communication because to most people, when you request a \xABfeminine\xBB font,
    they'll name pretty, decorative, swirly, floaty-elegant designs; not \xABstrong\xBB
    ones. So while I personally wouldn't necessarily put the \xABbut\xBB there either,
    I understand that it doesn't need to come from a closed mindset but maybe just
    from trying to prevent a too-common, unintended reply. Now do we seriously need
    to argue if the original poster would correctly have to ask for a \xABstrong <em>and</em>
    feminine\xBB font instead? "
