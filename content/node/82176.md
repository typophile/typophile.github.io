body: Is anyone using an iPod touch or iPhone with a retina display and iDisplay to
  preview metrics in Fontlab on a Mac? I am tempted to buy an iPod to do this but
  I want to be sure that Fontlab can cope.

    resolution. That's still no substitute for a 1200dpi laser printer though, and
    those cost far less than iAnything!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I can confirm that iDisplay works on an iPhone 4 with FontLab. I'd never
    tried this before--interesting idea. It has no effect on the performance of FontLab,
    any more than any extra display would. I would be careful about leaving FontLab
    windows or panels on the smaller display--it leaves them stranded sometimes if
    you change display setups.\r\n\r\nBTW, there's another similar app called Air
    Display which gets better reviews, but unfortunately doesn't support the resolution
    of the retina display. The reason they give is that UI elements would be too small
    to tap on. Apparently they didn't think of this kind of use."

  body: I just got a tablet - a "Nexus 10", which is a bit cheaper than an iPad, and
    has a higher resolution screen - to show my FontLab preview window at 300 pixels
    per inch via Air Display. So far it's working nicely. Maybe not much use to someone
    who already knows how tweaks will look when scaled down, but I'm hoping it'll
    help me learn faster, and save some paper.
