    old this sample is, and/or what the source is? Also, do you have any other samples
    showing more letters?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've looked for that name in almost every book I have and I've Googled it
    on the web. The only reference to Livorno that wasn't the city or its soccer team
    talks about a 'Livorno font' from an Israeli company called FontBit, whose fonts
    appear to be Hebrew. I couldn't get an English version of their page to open,
    so I am stuck there. \r\n\r\nWhat else do you know about it Nick?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I've been delving into my archives Mike. I remember doing a kern and space
    job on this for M&C Saatchi in 1999. I think it may have been custom designed
    especially for Asprey and Garrard (Royal warrant jewellers). On my key map print
    out the copyright notice reads '1995 dtp Types Ltd', which I happen to know is
    run by Malcolm Wooden. I can find no mention of Livorno on their website.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a pretty classy font with tall ascenders (or smallish x-height, depending on how
    you look at it) and a very long tail on both the cap and lower case y. It may
    be based upon an old typeface but I have no idea what it could be. It's a shame
    it isn't generally available.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Thanks for the information Nick. It reminded me of Colwell, which Nick Curtis
    has revived as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mckenna-handletter-nf/\">McKenna
    Handletter</a>. I have always been attracted to the antique typefaces with the
    low x-heights, so it was bugging me that I couldn't find a match for it. Now I
    know why.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for Letraset's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/\">Carlton</a>.
    That might make a good alternative for you Danny.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
