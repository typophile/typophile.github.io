  over Highway 401 East of Toronto.\r\nI'm curious to know if the name and numerals
  are from an actual typeface or is it lettering by the sculptor?\r\n\r\nThere Used
  to be a 4 plaques like this, showing the street name, the year and the motto (VT
  INCEPIT FIDELIS SIC PERMANET) on every bridge over a 400 series highway in Ontario,
  so it would seem to make sense for it to be from a typeface.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nruss"

  body: "I'd guess it's custom by the sculptor. If it's molded in concrete, there
    could have been a standard set of dies made up for the letters and numerals, but
    my guess is that each one would have been hand-carved from what appears to be
    sandstone.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nEDIT: Didn't read that it was concrete. I stand
    by my die hypothesis."

  body: "I think Lex's idea makes a lot of sense, although it also seems possible
    that the dies he suggested were based on an existing typeface. I notice the '7'
    is quite odd -- more like an upside-down 'L'.  I can't think of a typeface with
    that feature. This date was 1947. Are all the bridges of a similar age, and were
    the plaques made when the bridges were built, or added on later?\r\n\r\nWould
    you have any more samples of the lettering? For my purposes only the R and E in
    this sample are useful as key letters. I'd like to know what the C, G, J, K, M,
    U or W look like to have more to base an ID on.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    <a href=\"http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFHabitat_2c5a.html\">'Habitat'</a>
    seems like a pretty good match for the letters in 'LIVERPOOL'. That font was designed
    in 1985, but who knows if it was based on anything older. [Note: you need to use
    the site's 'TRY' feature to see the range of weights for the font.]\r\n\r\n- Mike

    7 sure is quirky.  \r\n"
