  your thoughts on a logo I'm working on.  The guy is a record producer, engineer
  and mixer, as well as being an arranger and composer.  He wants something sleek
  and modern, but nothing to heavily tied to usual musical stereotypes.\r\n\r\nI've
  come up with a concept that I like, but I've got it in 4 different incarnations
  / arrangements.  I'd like to know what you think.\r\n\r\nTake a look here at: [[http://twitpic.com/g1pg0]]\r\n\r\nThe
  other option is a logo based on the famous typographic logo from the client's biggest
  musical influence, Peter Gabriel's \"So.\"  I figure that anybody who knows of the
  record would get a kick out of it and get a sense for Doug's style, and anyone who
  wouldn't would just think it looks nice.  I think it's an homage (I love Saville!)
  but I don't want people to think I'm ripping him off.\r\n\r\nTake a look at that
  here: [[http://twitpic.com/g1pj4]]\r\n\r\nAnyways, would love to know your thoughts."

  body: Really?  I thought that was the weakest of the 4. I think I should maybe bring
    down the weight of the Helvetica Neue a little bit on that one so it doesn't overtake
    the logo.

    the wordmark. But I think that among the samples you provided, that one remains
    the most original and the one with the better type placement."
