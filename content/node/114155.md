  be very difficult with just 2 letters (P & C) but that's all I've got. I'd appreciate
  if someone with Jaspert's Encyclopaedia of Typefaces could check it in that great
  resource. Or maybe some experienced gurus here from the letterpress era could help.
  This means a lot to me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PC Typophile_4722.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nJust
  an update:\r\n\r\nFinally, I have found another letter of this beautiful script
  i.e. the capital \"I\". I think it is from the 1950s or 60s because a logo (see
  below) in which I found the same \"C\" is from that era. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IC

  body: The PC seems very like Ambassador Script from Rebecca Alaccari, Canada Type.
    The /I does not and the timing is off.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pc1_6511.jpg]

  body: Very good try DPape. Indeed, the P has a close resemblance because Ambassador
    Script is based on the original Juliet typeface. Could it be that Juliet had other
    versions?
