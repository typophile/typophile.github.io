  but not any modifications. \r\n\r\nI've seen it used by a company in a new line
  of products (printed handbags, umbrellas, etc) and it appears different \u2014 as
  if they put a 3pt stroke around it in Adobe Illustrator. \r\n\r\nThere's no way
  for me to know if they modified the font, creating a new font from it for use, or
  just simply added strokes in graphics software for print. I'm assuming the latter
  doesn't count.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to find out?"

    results then you have a case.\r\n\r\nBTW even if that's not what they did a properly
    written letter (preferably from a lawyer) proposing a -modest- settlement might
    just click.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    be handled similarly regardless of the application?

  body: "Any change to the font is important if you have not permitted it under the
    terms of your license agreement or general terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nMost foundries
    seem to allow modification of outlines in a vector art programs like Illustrator,
    as long as that modification is not then re-introduced to the font.\r\n\r\nOther
    foundries allow modification as long as the resulting modified font is used for
    internal business purposes only.\r\n\r\nSome foundries do not allow any manipulation
    of the outlines, either within the context of the font or any mode of output.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are unhappy with the way in which the outlines have been used, whether modified
    within a font editing tool or a vector art program then, as Hrant suggests, you
    should try and contact them about the nature of the modifications and discuss
    whether some kind of deal can be worked out."
