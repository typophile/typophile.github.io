		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm&hellip; I have to say I'm with Hrant. It makes considerably more sense to suggest changing a few glyphs to bring them into unison with the rest of the face than to suggest changing the entire font to match one or two glyphs. <BR> <BR>Of course, we needn't choose between &quot;interesting/strong&quot; and &quot;uninteresting/weak&quot;. As an alternative, why not create a second alternates set? One font set with more &quot;conservative&quot; characters, and a companion set with the wilder, more daring (and perhaps more interesting) ones? It makes sense that this would increase the font's utility. <BR> <BR>I further disagree with Clive's assertion that Hrant was encouraging Luce to go in a &quot;weak direction,&quot; just as I disagree that the rest of the character set (apart from the &quot;e&quot;) are &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;generic&quot;. I suspect that Hrant feels (as I do) that the current &quot;e&quot; doesn't fit the same set of rules that were established by the other characters, e.g., establishing a crossing in the upper right part of the character, where a crossing wouldn't normally exist (the only other example we have of such a crossing is in the upper left part of the &quot;p&quot;, where it seems natural for such a crossing or strokes to occur. This is not to say that it can't be done, but I think it would be wise to create an &quot;e&quot; that fits with the rest of the glyphs as designed, and then, if you wish, design another set of characters that fits more with the &quot;e&quot; as designed. <BR> <BR>My 2 cents. <BR> <BR>David</div>

A lot of these fliers are for So. Cal events. I peruse them just about every week. The designers always seem to be using crazy 3-D modeling software with innovative type treatments. Some really good stuff. Some really bad stuff. <BR> <BR>As Martin said, Lychee is custom lettering that served its purpose but&hellip;don't throw it away. With some of the 'fixes' mentioned above, Lychee could certainly enjoy a second life as a typeface &ndash; a specialized face for people who design rave fliers. (yes, a small small market.) <BR> <BR>Rave fonts are not for everyone. They're not your father's Oldstyle. But to say that Luce's letterorms 'don't work' is to not be 'in' on this segment of counter culture &ndash; rave letterforms are deliberately off kilter. <BR> <BR>Also, note the work of Andreas Lindholm, one of the top 'rave font designers'.

		<div class="commentbody">Amen, bj. I couldn't have put it better. <BR> <BR>But I'll try anyway. ;) <BR> <BR>&gt; Generally type is about flow in a character, ie how you would complete it with a big thick marker  <BR>or brush (not detail, just basic form).  <BR> <BR>I can honestly say Garamond's and Bodoni's types had little if anything to do with how they would complete them with &quot;a big fat marker or brush.&quot; Of course, as I have been taught to understand them, Garamond's types were based on (quill) pen forms, but Bodoni's were based more on rendering (drawing) and &quot;perfecting&quot; the basic outlines (as opposed to actually writing them with a pen). And no one can honestly argue that Helvetica, Franklin Gothic or Bureau Grotesque are letterforms forms with bases in penwriting (marker or other). They are based more on illustration of the letterform outlines than on handwritten penforms. <BR> <BR>My point (and I do have one <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> ) is that different fonts are based on different inspirations and different logical paradigms. To say that all font forms have to be based on the flow of marker or brush lettering is fallacious. <BR> <BR>&gt;David's comment about cross-overs in the wrong places doesn't really make sense to me, this is an &quot;experimental&quot; face, right? <BR> <BR>Ironically, your argument about the brush answers what I meant by this. In the &quot;p&quot;, the crossover occurs where two strokes naturally come together anyway, but in the &quot;e&quot;, the crossover seems arbitrary and out of place, where a single stroke would normally exist. This isn't to say that the glyph can't (or even shouldn't) be rendered with the crossover exactly where it occurs, but I am a believer that a typeface should have at least a level of internal consistency and logic; if an element exists, there should be a reason for it to exist, and it should be echoed (if not exactly repeated) elsewhere in the face. Inconsistencies of course can occur, but they should be defendable where they do occur. If such a crossover occurs in the &quot;e&quot;, where is that decision echoed in the rest of the face? <BR> <BR>Of course this isn't a book face, by any stretch of the imagination. Nor would I really call it an &quot;experimental&quot; face, although some personal experimentation is obviously occuring from Luce's (and all of us critics') point of view. It is a display face (as correctly categorized by its placement here on the Display forum), and considering the application for which it was designed (taking the criticism about the weight/legibility issue into account), it seems to work well enough for its intended purpose. <BR> <BR>And Luce: As Joe said, congratulations! You've got an interesting typeface going, and you've sparked a terrific discussion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David: <BR>&gt;I can honestly say Garamond's and Bodoni's types <BR>&gt;had little if anything to do with how they would <BR>&gt;complete them with &quot;a big fat marker or brush.&quot;  <BR>&gt;Of course, as I have been taught to understand <BR>&gt;them, Garamond's types were based on (quill)  <BR>&gt;pen forms, <BR> <BR>We're really not going to argue about the style of writing implement are we? All type is derived from handwriting (excption is probably the euro symbol), the lineage is clear. <BR> <BR>&gt;but Bodoni's were based more on rendering <BR>&gt;(drawing) and &quot;perfecting&quot; the basic <BR>&gt;outlines (as opposed to actually writing them  <BR>&gt;with a pen). <BR> <BR>Have you ever hand rendered Bodoni at small sizes? I can assure you  that the thick/thin of a pen makes all the difference. <BR> <BR>&gt;And no one can honestly argue that <BR>&gt;Helvetica, Franklin Gothic or Bureau Grotesque  <BR>&gt;are letterforms forms with bases in penwriting <BR>&gt;(marker or other). They are based more <BR>&gt;on illustration of the letterform outlines than  <BR>&gt;on handwritten penforms. <BR> <BR>I think you are misunderstanding my point, which is to be expected because to get it over properly would require a quick demonstration. <BR> <BR>Essentially what I'm trying to point out is that *if* you draw the core structure of any of these fonts there is an innate &quot;flow&quot;. This flow isn't in some of Luce's characters for the reasons I have stated. <BR> <BR>If we reflect on the model for SE Asian scripts they are generally characterised by reasonably short, linear strokes, that cross but don't usually blend into each other. <BR> <BR>&gt;To say that all font forms have to be based on  <BR>&gt;the flow of marker or brush lettering is <BR>&gt;fallacious. <BR> <BR>I think you're making a point based on your previous misunderstanding.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Clive: <BR> <BR>I think you're projecting your own expectations of how these letters should be designed onto Luce's design. <BR> <BR>Luce never said he intended to to model this font after Asian scripts; indeed, in his own words from his first post, &quot;The design of the letters are grid based and modular&hellip;.&quot; and his intention was, again in his own words, to &quot;evoke the streamlined, clean aspect of asian fusion food&quot;. It seems obvious to me that it was never intended to be a script, but rather a modular letter. <BR> <BR>As for Bodoni , it sounds like you have misconstrued my argument. Of course Bodoni was still based on the penforms that came before it; but, to quote Robert Bringhurst (&quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot;, 2nd Ed., p. 130) &quot;Romantic [i.e., &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;didone&quot;] letters can be extraordinarily beautiful, but they lack the flowing and steady rhythm of Renaissance forms.&quot; (Brackets added.) <BR> <BR>It was this development (the Romantic form) in typography that began the move away from the lyrical flow of penwriting and began to move toward a more contructive approach, more concerned with the statuesque outlines of the glyphs than with emulative handwriting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow!!! <BR>I have been working like a dog since I last posted this, and look what happens when I come back: a deliciously interesting typographical debate! Thank you everyone for the comments, they are what enables one to further one's thoughts and hone one's skills. I definitely appreciate the brief history of handwriting; it unscrewed a lost pod of knowledge from my distant design BA. ;-) <BR>I am taking into consideration everything you guys have said. As for the face having a &quot;rave&quot; flavour, its probably because I've done a whole truck load of flyers in my time, and was immensely influenced by people like Büro Destrukt and Designers Republic (not that Lychee even approaches the techno whimsicality of faces like Kristallo and Cravt, which also originated as logos). Also, the letters were definitely designed to be alogo and not a face, so there are inconsistencies in the glyphs if it were to become a face. In any case, i think I will spark more discussion in another thread, presenting another display type essay. <BR>Oh, and David: I am a she, not a he. <BR>;-)</div>
