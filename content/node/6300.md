body: I just got a copy of the newest edition of <i>Spatium,</i> a German magazine
  on typography produced by the Typosition Studio in Offenbach. The star article in
  the issue is by Hrant, on the Latinization of Non-Latin scripts and typefaces <BR>
  <BR>Snipits about Spatium and Hrant&#39;s article have been heard on typophile before,
  but I think that it is now time for everyone to place their orders for the magazine,
  as it has finally arrived &#40;it was presented publicly for the first time today,
  in Offenbach, of course&#41;. This issue, unlike the previous three, is printed
  in both German and English. <BR> <BR>Spatium Magazine <BR><a href="http://www.spatium-newsletter.de/index.php"

  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;There is also a tiny contribution on page 49 from TypeOff., the
  HfG Offenbach&#39;s Type Design Collective. <a href="http://www.typeoff.de" target="_blank">http://www.typeoff.de</a>&#41;

  body: Dan, <BR>Thanks for the post.  Is there a way those of us who don&#39;t understand
    German can order Spatium?  I went to their site and gave it the old college try
    but couldn&#39;t find a way. <BR> <BR>Chris

  body: Hmm, good question, Chris. I took a look at the website, and the issue is
    so new that the site&#39;s order form hasn&#39;t been updated yet. I emailed Peter,
    and will let you know how you can place an order.

    a full PDF of it &#40;at least not for a while&#41;, but the point of the essay
    is to explain what Latinization is and where it comes from &#40;and how ancient
    it is&#41;, show exactly what can be good but what is usually bad about it, and
    conclude with a technical elaboration of how to &#34;channel&#34; it positively
    in making a multi-script typeface system. <BR> <BR>BTW, Dan, I don&#39;t know
    about &#34;star article&#34; - there&#39;s a lot of other great stuff in there.

    It was the most specific thematic, theoretic contribution, and also the longest
    that wasn&#39;t from one of the two editors

    number of words together to make a super new word&#41;, lots of funny little dots,
    and this wierd little character that looks like a Greek letter beta
