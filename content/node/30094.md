body: "I'm looking for a delicate Didone or Modern typeface. I want something elegant,
  with lower contrast than a standard Bodoni, preferably in a light or ultralight
  weight. Maybe something almost monlinear, but not quite.\r\n\r\nLinotype Didot has
  a really thin hairline, but the contrast is still too thick. It also feels too rigid,
  with a very, very strict vertical stress.\r\n\r\nFilosofia has a more monlinear
  feel, but isn't that thin, and certainly not delicate.\r\n\r\nI already have a few
  cuts of Kepler, but it's too workman-like and the thin weights feel like they're
  about to poke you with their spikes.\r\n\r\nIt's for my Grandmother, who is a delicate,
  yet graceful. Wasp-ish, but calm and resolute. Soft and feminine.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys.\r\n\r\nAdactio? Does the link go anywhere other than an ad?\r\n\r\nPurple
    \u2013 Too chunky. Almost a ITC Bodoni Six feel. (Not a bad thing, but not what
    I want.)\r\n\r\nBodoni Egyptian \u2013 Very cool. That's more of what I was thinking,
    but not it yet. It still has to <cite>feel</cite> like a Modern. This is more
    of a typewriter.\r\n\r\nLet me revise that, I don't need a monoline. I want a
    lower contrast Didone in a thin weight. Something where the curves blend gracefully
    rather than abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, last stop the ad., just silly or funny, sorry.\r\nBut regarding your
    request, if you haven't found a suitable one yet, I'd like to inform you about
    the italian 'cut' name <em>Bach Bodoni</em> which you might be interested in (it
    has the light weight as well), I am not sure how that is on sale but you could
    try the designer, I'd say it'd depend on the job you need it for, but I might
    be wrong."

  body: "A lower contrast Didone is a higher contrast Egyptian.\r\nSo the isssue of
    size becomes critical, because you don't want it to be too slabby, which it will
    be large.\r\nHow about Schadow Light -- That would fit the bill if you don't get
    too big.\r\nYou might also try taking a bit off weight off a Clarendon Light."

  body: "Thanks guys. I love the H&FJ Didot, but I would like something where the
    the serifs are bracketed, at least a little. I think that that would help even
    out the contrast a bit. I like the Clarendon Light I idea, but I don't have the
    time, nor have I even developed the skills yet to do so.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a design
    for her tax office, and she will be ordering new office supplies and stationary
    sometime in mid-January, so I'm searching for something \"out of the box\" so
    to speak.\r\n\r\nBy the way, has anyone seen the Greek Font Society Bodoni? It
    has regular, italic, bold and bold italic weights, full Latin and Greek support
    and even has small caps! All wrapped up in a fully coded OpenType font. For FREE!! "

  body: "I used Diotima for a realtor's ad campaign once. Wow, did she not care. Realtors
    suck by the way, they have zero sense of typgraphic style. Everything must be
    Arial or TNR or else it \"just doesn't look professional\" to them. Yuck.\r\n\r\nBut
    I like the typeface. Maybe I'm limiting myself by calling for a Didone? Let's
    open it up to anything that fits my above descriptions. I'd like to see what you
    think.\r\n\r\nSo here 'tis:\r\n\r\n<ul>Something elegant, with lower contrast
    than a standard Bodoni, preferably in a light or ultralight weight.</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>Delicate,
    yet graceful. Wasp-ish, but calm and resolute. Soft and feminine.</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>Something
    where the curves blend gracefully rather than abruptly, with gently bracketed
    serifs.</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>Preferably more Neo-Classical or Modern in stress and
    finish, but not neccesarily so much.</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n"
