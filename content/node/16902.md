body: "Ok, the topic is lying a bit. But its a work around that works like multiple
  layers should do.\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\nTake your favorite encoding and open it in a
  editor. Now select all glyphs, copy it and paste it to the end of the same encoding
  file. Now add to every glyph a period.\r\n\r\nsample\r\n\r\nA\r\nB\r\nC\r\nA.\r\nB.\r\nC.\r\n\r\nIn
  fact you have doubled every glyph of your encoding. These gylphs will work as your
  \"layer\".\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nNow you have to open the Groups.txt and use the same
  trick to assign these new gylphs to your standard glyphs. I have done it with Excel
  and saved the text as tabulator divided text.\r\n\r\nsample \r\n\r\nA A.\r\nB B.\r\nC
  C.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNow you can switch by double clicking on the shape group to
  get to your new \"layer\". (Please enable \"Double-click to edit neighbor or sahpe
  gylph group\" in the FLS prefs.) If you need more layers, you have to do the same
  steps again. A three layers encoding would look like this:\r\nA\r\nB\r\nC\r\nA.\r\nB.\r\nC.\r\nA..\r\nB..\r\nC..\r\n\r\nThe
  Shape groups file would look like this:\r\n\r\nA A. A..\r\nB B. B..\r\nC C. C..\r\n\r\nInstead
  of .. you can use other gylphs like : ; but dont use , (comma)!\r\n\r\nSo, in the
  metrics window you can work with the first layer like before. If you need to set
  some samples to compare your different designs/layers, it should look like this.\r\n\r\nHamburgvons
  \\n/H./a./m./b./u./r./g./v./o./n./s.\r\n\r\nBTW. The extension pattern to use a
  period is a first hack. Adam & Yuri will hopefully find a setup that is compatible
  with all aspects of FontLab & Phyton. The simplicity of this solution is plausible,
  the file format of FontLab needs no special treatment to store layers and the format
  stays compatible to earlier versions."
