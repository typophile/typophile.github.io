body: Hi, <BR>  <BR>I am looking for a nice simple sans serif font, which won&#39;t
  hurt the eye, if reading large amount of text at 10 points. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?
  <BR> <BR>Also, is readibility affected by margins , line spacings and paragraph
  justifications? <BR> <BR>What is the optimal arrangement for maximizing legibility?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in Advance, <BR>Suddha Satta Ray <BR>

    Legato font is quite possibly the most readable sans ever, especially at around
    10 point. The really good news is that you can currently download the Semi weight
    of Legato for free from the FontShop site! <BR> <BR>&#62; is readibility affected
    by margins , line spacings and paragraph justifications? <BR> <BR>Margins and
    line spacing are mostly a matter of having enough of: too little and you&#39;ll
    cause too many errant fixations of the eyes &#40;off the page in the case of the
    former, and to the wrong line upon a &#34;carriage return&#34; in the case of
    the latter&#41;. Justification however doesn&#39;t seem to make a big difference
    &#40;although <i>hyphenation</i> is a totally different matter&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'On line length, &#34;measure&#34;, personally I find that it makes a big
    difference in readability. Bringhurst says that 66 lc characters &#40;2 1/2 lc
    alphabet lengths&#41; is ideal, and he seems to be right for serif faces. You
    might need shorter for sans serif. Line space, &#34;leading&#34; also makes a
    big difference. Here you have to experiment with each typeface as the appropriate,
    good leading is affected by a lot of factors, including the measure. <BR> <BR>The
    measure and leading have a big affect on readability - as much as the typeface
    or more. Then next comes margins, which are important, not so much as measure
    and leading.  <BR> <BR>I agree with Hrant that justification or not is not so
    important to readability - mainly a matter of aesthetics within a given design. '
