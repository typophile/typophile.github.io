body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixel2_5751.png]\r\nThis is from a screenshot
  taken off a website. I believe this is a font that comes standard in Photoshop (it
  might be a standard Windows font?). I'm sorry I can't give much info, I'm not very
  knowledgeable with fonts. Hopefully someone can tell what it is from the image.\r\n\r\nFWIW,
  I know it isn't MS Serif, which is what I originally thought it was. I did figure
  out that the font size is 16 though. I don't know how useful that information is,
  but hey."
