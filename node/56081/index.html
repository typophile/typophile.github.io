  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m redesigning <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fca_/tags/chumbitos/">Chumbitos</a> and I want to &ldquo;fill&rdquo; its glyph &ldquo;space&rdquo;, as another character. The problem is: When I test an .otf on Adobe software, it looks ok, but when I break the text into curves, the glyph &ldquo;space&rdquo; simply disappears. The curious thing is that on Corel the glyph appears only when I break the text into curves. And in Office, it looks ok&hellip;</p>
<p>I thought that was happening because of a bad/poor draw of the glyph, but it happens with anything I put there&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea on what happens with this glyph?! :-/</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a PC (Windows XP) using FontLab with the &ldquo;FreeFont&rdquo; encoding&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m attaching a preview image to show what I want from the glyph &ldquo;space&rdquo;, just to illustrate my sad story&hellip; ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks,
Anderson</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting. I suspect that applications are making assumptions about /space/ being an empty, invisible glyph. They&rsquo;re not making the same assumptions, but they are making assumptions, and you are seeing the symptoms of these assumptions.</p>
<p>Since these assumptions are almost certainly character-level, not glyph-level, there is probably nothing you can do about this on the font end.</p>
<p>You might try encoding your shaded space glyph as something other than the space character (e.g. U+2592, medium shade), and inform users that if they want this shaded space, then they should search-and-replace for the space character.</p>

<p>Anyone from Adobe/Corel would like to say something about our assumptions? :-)</p>
<p>By the way, I never worked with opentype features, but I was thinking: Can I use it to replace the space character with another one, &ldquo;automagically&rdquo;, like a ligature thing?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Thomas, Jan,</p>
<p>I tried Illustrator and Flash CS3, and both did the same thing. Photoshop (CS3) does it fine&hellip; Maybe a vector rendering issue?</p>
<p>And sorry Jan, my english is not that good, so maybe I do not got exactly what you wrote. Do you think that because it retains the width between words/characters but drops it at the end of line, it&rsquo;s not a bug? Definitively it is a different behavior, but I think that, if the software is &ldquo;educated&rdquo; to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the space always as a blank space between characters, it&rsquo;s obvious that at the end of line it&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;dropped&rdquo;, because it do not has any character at its left&hellip; :-)</p>
<p>The question &ndash; I think &ndash; is: these softwares take care of the content of the glyph space or they just get its width to do the thing? But maybe I&rsquo;m completely wrong and it&rsquo;s all my fault with a dumb misconfiguration&hellip; Anyway, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; a new file (<a href="http://www.fictilia.org/stuff/SpaceIssue.otf">SpaceIssue.otf</a>) to this post, in case someone want to do a quick test and share the experience&hellip; I suggest to write some words with spaces &ndash; it will show as circles between the squares &ndash; and then break it into curves to see if the circles (space) remains&hellip;</p>

I was just being recalcitrant after a good lunch and good dinner (burp, hiccup). Would it then stretch/shrink the character for ordinary space in a justified text setting?</p>
<p>Anderson, in this particular font there must be lots of characters on the keyboard that you could use for the (perhaps even different shades/textures) spaces? The lower case qwerty is six already: say 20% stipple, 40% stipple, 60% stipple, horizontal lines, vertical, diagonal? A simple readme file could explain the use &hellip; just a thought.</p>
