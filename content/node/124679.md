body: "So I've been working on typeface design beside my design studies. But I always
  had the question \"what is the real process of type design from the beginning to
  the end\" \r\n\r\nCan someone explain the order of all these to do list .\r\n\r\n\u2022
  A-Z a-z characters (I always use Adobe Illustrator to draw these forms but I don't
  even know what professionals do. Should I start in Illustrator or directly work
  in Fontlab to draw first characters? Why?)\r\n\u2022 Numbers and then punctuation
  glyphs\r\n\u2022 Accent characters\r\n\u2022 Adjusting Metrics\r\n\u2022 Creating
  kerning groups (I have some knowledge about it)\r\n\u2022 Kerning (I have some knowledge
  about it)\r\n\u2022 Hinting (I actually have no idea)\r\n\r\nSecond question:\r\nAre
  there some nicely explained tutorials about the understanding kerning and hinting
  process?\r\nOr extract the optical kerning data from illustrator which looks alright
  to me for now.\r\n\r\nTypefaces i'm working on\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36092187/fonts.png\"

  body: "There are many ways to make a font, and your approach seems just fine. It
    is not uncommon to have several iterations, but better focus on design first.\r\n\r\nSome
    people start with sketches which they convert to a font and then refine it with
    a professional font editor. It seems you've already made a pretty basic set of
    glyphs in AI so, you can immediately import them into your font editor. If you
    need changes to your glyphs, either do it in your font editor or copy-and-paste
    them back into AI.\r\n\r\nLet your font editor generate the accented characters.
    Adjusting metrics is one of them most important things, but don't spent to much
    time on it until you are satisfied with your basic character set. [[http://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator.html|FontCreator]]
    has optical metrics which generates excellent metrics.\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied
    with your character set, and with the metrics, then kerning is next. Also decide
    what OpenType layout features you want to include."
