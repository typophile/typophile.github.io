  to a potentially intimidating topic. We have a great sculpture by Ann Smith as the
  centerpiece, but I'd like some feedback on choosing a typeface and layout. Right
  now we have 115% horizontally stretched Futura for the title text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OneCoverB_3820.png]\r\n\r\nI've
  posted  <strong>[[http://www.computingforbiologists.org/images/CoverMockupsMar2010.png|four
  design mock-ups]]</strong> to give you an idea, in addition to the preview above.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your thoughts."

  body: "Good to know. I should just choose from the hundreds of other typefaces that
    fit the bill w/o modification. Any favorites come to mind? \r\n\r\nI wrote a script
    that rendered our title in all the fontshop and linotype sans options, and it
    is a bit overwhelming to try to choose. Avenir? Compati Fact? Finnegan?"

  body: I'd try Zag.  It can be used clean or with the leafy flourishes, which might
    be a good fit for computers and biology?

  body: "Thanks Dave. Zag does <strong>[[http://www.computingforbiologists.org/images/CoverMockupsMar2010zag.png|look
    fun]]</strong>, though the flourishes are only on the super light version? Could
    manually recreate some I suppose.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat convinced we wanted something
    on the plump side, but this face doesn't look austere at all. \r\n\r\nDo the basic
    layouts look viable?"

    you could stack them."

  body: The bird is a really fun image, and well photographed, but the typography
    is a real problem, and lets down the cover. I'd be happy to do some work with
    it on spec, if that's something you'd be interested in?
