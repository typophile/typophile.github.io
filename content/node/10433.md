body: After ten years or so at doodling fonts now and them for personal pleasure,
  I am considering the option of offering them for sale to type vendors, be it a big
  or a small one &#40;depends on the money they pay&#41;. I have got no clue, though,
  as to which is the price range for fonts. Can I get some insight into this? I would
  appreciate it a lot.

  body: 'Viejo, how much money you make from a font usually depends on how popular
    the font turns out to be, i.e., how many copies of the font will be sold. <BR>
    <BR>Most foundries pay a specific commission to the designer for each sale they
    make; a percentage. The important thing to keep in mind is the question: &#34;how
    much mileage is this foundry going to give my font?&#34; Let&#39;s say that one
    foundry offers you 25%, and a second just 15%.'

  body: 'I couldn&#39;t agree more. When I was just getting into digital type sales
    in the early 90s, I assumed that any reasonably decent font would sell at least
    10,000 copies at retail. Even then, I was told, 200 copies was considered hugely
    successful at retail.  <BR> <BR>Given how hard it is to sell large numbers of
    fonts retail, your royalty isn&#39;t the important thing: getting promoted is.
    Yet who is really doing promotion today?  <BR> <BR>Corporate sales are the way
    to go, but do you have  a product that a corporation will like well enough to
    pay let us say $80,000 for a 10,000 seat license?'

    Forums such as Typophile are a hot bed for type suggestion and promotion. I have
    no problem suggesting, for instance, Font Bureau. Why? Because I&#39;ve had nothing
    but good experiences with their fonts and their staff. <BR> <BR>Hope I didn&#39;t
    misunderstand this.'

  body: Viejo, different foundries offer different packages. Dan speaks volumes, I
    don&#39;t need to add to that. <BR> <BR>Would be interesting though to build some
    sort of comparative chart.

  body: Well, by promotion I mean, nice catalogues, nice mailings, nice customer lists
    ... all the things that used to sell fonts before the Internet. Publicity. Promotion.
    Mailings. Remember when font companies used to have quarterly or even monthly
    magazines they mailed out? You would look at those things, drool, and order. Doesn&#39;t
    work that way anymore.

  body: Well, I&#39;m going to try and guess what Stephen is talking about. <BR> <BR>FontShop
    Berlin publishes a large, many-page full color newletter. Often. Maybe every month
    even. German designers seem to swear by these things, although all other German
    foundries cut these out of their budgets years ago because they did not generate
    sales anymore &#40;yeah internet!&#41;. I must admit that the FS Berlin mail is
    very well designed, and presents the typefaces of many foundries, not just FontFont&#39;s,
    in a very good light. <BR> <BR>Perhaps this will be picked up by FS SF.

    &#40; at least to me &#41;</i>, were ugly, and boring, stock photo catalogs..
    <i>&#40; I wish I would receive the newsletter Dan is posting about, or anything
    type related at all.. But FontShop Austria doesnt seem to give a lot about type,
    at all.. StockPhotoShop Austria, rather.. &#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; Sorry, For ranting
    slightly Off Topic..</i>

    agencies prefer to &#39;share&#39; their existing typographic archives and collections..
    &#40; That may be one of the reasons why &#39;Agency A&#39; got the same fonts
    as &#39;Agency B&#39;, and, why over here quite a few things seem to look the
    same.. &#41;</i> <BR><i>&#40; Oh, And, I am already getting the FontShop SF eMail

  body: 'Thanks for your commments. Do you have any good or bad experience with the
    Scriptorium foundry? That was my first choice due to the nature of my project.
    I am doing some analysis on mexican hand-lettering and on mexican/spanish vintage
    type and lettering &#40;from the previous three centuries&#41;. I want to make
    an interpretation of those letters in order to create a set. The people at Scriptorium
    were interested in the project, but I want to know a little bit more about the
    normal price paid for such things. <BR> <BR>Allan Haley, at Monotype, kindly answered
    to me on this subject: <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello Mosh, <BR> <BR>The price of font can
    range from &#34;free&#34; to over $100. Generally, they run from $22 to $49. We
    price the new releases into the ITC and Monotype libraries at $39 and $55 for
    OpenType. <BR> <BR>Royalties are paid on fonts sold. We make royalty payments
    quarterly.&#34; <BR> <BR>Is this an OK price? I had thought that it would be more,
    but if that&#39;s the standard, I&#39;ll accept it. <BR> <BR>I am still doing
    my first sketches on this project, though. I am mexican, but I am living since
    six months ago in Munich, Germany, so I am resourcing to my personal photo archive
    for sources. <BR> <BR>And H'
