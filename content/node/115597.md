  body: "Except for the broken-script sharp transition in the vertical stroke --  which
    is what I am hoping exists somewhere as a font or lettering -- the base letter
    looks similar to Inserat Cursive, as shown in Nick Curtis's Graphic Stylin NF

  body: "Hi Mike, thanks for your reply. I know it's a hand lettered logo -- perhaps
    from 1927? -- but I thought it worth plumbing the depths of knowledge of our resident
    font detectives. Never know what surprises could uncovered unless I ask.\r\nDon"
