    Viewer says:\r\n\r\nDetermine word and character counts\r\n\r\nPlace the insertion
    point in a text frame to view counts for the entire thread of frames (the story),
    or select text to view counts only for the selected text.\r\nChoose Window > Info
    to display the Info panel.\r\nThe Info panel displays the number of characters,
    words, lines, and paragraphs in a text frame. The position of the insertion point
    within the text frame also appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for asking, never knew about
    it!"
