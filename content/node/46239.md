  body: Isn't Lisa Simpson a little young to get married? I wouldn't expect Marge

  body: Actually in one of the episodes, she does get married (well almost) to a British
    chap she meets in college. Hugh something or other. It was the episode where the
    Simpsons went to a Renaissances Faire and Lisa visited a fortune teller.
