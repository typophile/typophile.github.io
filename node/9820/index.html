		<div class="commentbody">I'll just note that the design of the Cyrillic and Greek letters in Helvetica Linotype differs very considerably from the earlier Helvetica Cyrillic and Greek designs (the latter from the 1970s, not sure about the Cyrillic). When Linotype approach me about making a version of Helvetica for use as core fonts in software systems, I recommended redesigning the Cyrillic and Greek, and was very happy when Linotype okay'd the budget for this. It should also be noted that Helvetica Linotype was completely respaced (Latin too), because the older Helvetica fonts (and the Helvetica Pro fonts that are based on them) had inherited 18-unit spacing from earlier font formats, so had inconsistent sidebearings. This is important to note, because you won't get the same line-layout between the  Helvetica Pro fonts and the new Helvetica Linotype. So if you have existing documents set in the old Helvetica fonts and don't want them to reflow, you should avoid using the new font for that text. So, for instance, you might find that you end up using the Helvetica Pro fonts for Latin text and Helvetica Linotype only for the Cyrillic and Greek.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, I'm not sure if any of the other Helvetica versions can solve your problems in four single fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(The following is not an official statement)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For instance, from what I can tell from the Linotype webshop, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neue Helvetica Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fonts have Western Latin and CE character sets in them, but not Greek or Cyrillic.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The OpenType fonts in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetica<!-- raw HTML omitted --> family on the other hand are different. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Std<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems to have Cyrillic characters in the character set, but no CE.

If you tell them exactly what your requirements are, they should be able to give you all of the definitive answers you would need. Additionally, you can call them up if e-mail isn't your thing.

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, your question wasn't misplacesd at all. I just have to point out that for 100%-accurate info about any foundry's fonts, that foundry would be the best source. This isn't marketing spin; I am not a customer service rep, and I can make mistakes, too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only reason I asked here was because I deemed the information as found on MyFonts and the Linotype website confusing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is why companies have customer service <!-- raw HTML omitted --> . Plus, I don't think that Helvetica Linotype is for sale on MyFonts at the moment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that Typophile is the best source on the internet for opinion and information exchange about typography. This is a great place to ask &quot;what is the best font for this job&quot; or &quot;what are the roots of xxx typeface's design&quot; or even &quot;what is the future of OpenType application support?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the best place to find out whether or not a speciific character range is in a given commercial font is from the distributors themselves. This information is constantly changing. On a forum, you could get inaccurate advice, and then waste or lose time and money. And that would be sad. It would be great if every foundry would have their customer service reps surf typophile and other web forums around the clock to always dispense accurate information. Unfortuantely, this isn't the case at the moment, and a lot of info comes from individuals whose hearts are in the right place, but who may not be aware of certain little details in every case.</div>
