  body: I was able to get thousands of what appear to be quality URW fonts (both PS
    and.ttf) on a CD that came with a magazine called "Computer Arts" from the UK
    about two years ago at Barnes & Noble. A tremedous value. It was somewhere around
    $10. Those kinds of things don't come by every day. That's probably a good thing
    for the people who make fonts for a living?
