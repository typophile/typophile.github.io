  avoid using <strong>Futura</strong> for a complete broaqdcast package we're designing.
  <strong>Avenir</strong> is not an option and they (again those powers-that-be) are
  opposed to <strong>Avant Garde</strong>. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks typophiles"

    new too... i don''t know how to find it. i''d say look at some house industries
    fonts like Chalet and Neutraface, those are the first two that come to mind. Serif
    Gothic might be worth a look (although its a bit different in character than the
    others you mentioned). '

      and has much more flair (for lack of a less-wanky word) than i had originally
      looked for. thats a contender!\r\n\r\nthanks!"

      flaws all apply to Avant Garde, and would to Avenir if it were old enough to
      be overused. They are inherent in the design of all regular geometric sans.
      At least Futura has the sense to avoid Avant Garde's absurdly large x-height.
      \r\n\r\nOnce you've decided to use something \"Futura-like\", you're basically
      assuming most of Futura's flaws anyway, so you might as well go ahead and use
      it. If you have <strong>specific</strong> problems with Futura (like \"I prefer
      two-storey 'a's\") then please voice them.\r\n\r\n<em>that the most often used

    a bug\"\r\n\r\nOf course Futura has a mediocre performance as a text face compared
    to most classical roman text faces (altough I read once a whole book set in Futura
    and it didn't annoyed me as much as reading another book tightly set in Caslon
    540). \r\n\r\nFutura still has a lot of character which seems unchallenged today
    despite the various attempts to substitute it with some other \"improved faces\"
    like the boring Univers like Avenir.\r\n\r\nI alsho think that the more classical
    structure of Futura (and it's consequent elegance) is true to a geometric sans
    serif as much as to a greek or roman rustical inscription. Most of the other geometric
    sans serf are not elegant at all.\r\n\r\nToo bad it's overused but people is much
    less sensitive to this than us.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
