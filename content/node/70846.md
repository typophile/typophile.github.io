  hard to find on Google. I'm hoping the Typophile think-tank can help point me in
  the right direction. :-)\r\n\r\nWe're rebranding a company that was founded in the
  early 19th century (yes, they're *that* old) in the United States, and we're trying
  to find authentic typefaces from the era, or modern reinterpretations that offer
  a comparable effect.  \r\n\r\nI don't know what the early 19th-century designers
  used, whether they were American typefaces or imported, but whatever was relatively
  common at the time for promotional materials, we're hoping to emulate as closely
  as reasonably possible.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for display, body, the whole shebang.
  Any info you have off the top of our head, or can point us to, would be *much* appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    might also work well; [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monticello-lt/|Monticello]]
    might be still better. \r\nAnother display option would be an \"antique\" slab-serif.
    Something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/farao/black/|Farao Black]],
    maybe set in all caps, could work well. "

  body: "Shinntype's <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf\">Modern
    Suite</a> is designed to produce a facsimile mid-19th century look. The bold caps
    of Figgins Sans are the only reasonably authentic style of sans, as sans lower
    case and other weights were not introduced until much later in the century, nonetheless
    the other Figgins Sans styles are based on the serif style of the era. Scotch
    Modern is a revival of what is probably a George Bruce (American typefounder)
    face in an 1870 Albany publication; however, the Scotch Modern style was widely
    used from early in the century.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nora;cc=nora;rgn=full%20text;idno=nora0001-1;didno=nora0001-1;view=image;seq=7;node=nora0001-1%3A2;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset;\">Here</a>
    is a sample of Scotch from 1815.\r\n\r\nMiller does not correspond with this style
    of Scotch, in particular the capitals, shorter than the ascenders, and almost
    the same stem width as the lower case. \r\n\r\nIt depends on whether you wish
    to go with a Transitional style, such as Monticello or Miller, or the cool European
    modern (Bodoni), or a Scotch Modern. I would recommend the Scotch Modern, of course,
    the reason I revived it is because it does represent the 19th century in a way
    that Bodoni and the Scotch Romans (transitionals) don't, as it was the \"default\"
    American style for most of the 19th century, and those other faces were much used
    throughout the 20th century. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
