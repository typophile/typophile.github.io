  ccmp0;\r\n script latn; # Latin\r\nlookup ccmp0;\r\n} ccmp;\r\n</code>\r\n(or feature
  \"dlig\")\r\n\r\nand MS VOLT lookup source:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nDEF_LOOKUP \"l002\"

  I tried to ship font using MS VOLT, but this compiled feature becomes unavailable
  in Chrome browser (Firefox is OK, I didn't test IE10). How can I solve the problem
  with Microsoft VOLT or FontLab?"

  body: "I believe the dieresis at U+00A8 is what most of us think of as a \"legacy\"
    dieresis. It originated back when only the first 127 characters of ASCII were
    fixed. In many 8-bit ASCII encodings, there was a dieresis at A8. \r\n\r\nIt should
    live on only for the proper reading of older texts, before Unicode. (Unless there
    is any need for a spacing modifier dieresis, as I don't believe Unicode has one.)
    Any new use as a  combining diacritical should be U+0308. \r\n\r\nHaving said
    that, most font designer's don't bother with including <strong>any</strong> of
    the combining diacritics, which makes their fonts not proper Unicode."

      That comment is applied to explicitly unassigned blocks which are never supposed

  body: "Concerning the original question, I suggest having a look at <a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers\">Opentype
    features in web browsers</a> by Gustavo Ferreira on typotheque. There is a <a
    href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers_-_tests\">series
    of tests</a>, and in particular for <a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers_-_tests#liga\">liga</a>,
    standard ligatures. Unfortunately, the syntax varies from browser to browser.
    I managed to get the ligatures working with Chrome on Mac OS X 10.8 (with a webkit
    font) with the following settings (a list copied from the site so as to cover
    most browsers and situations)\r\n<PRE>\r\nfont-feature-settings: \"liga\" on;
    \  \r\n/* vendor-prefixes */\r\n-moz-font-feature-settings: 'liga=1';\r\n-ms-font-feature-settings:
    \"liga\" on;\r\n-webkit-font-feature-settings: \"liga\" on;\r\n-o-font-feature-settings:
    \"liga\" on;\r\n</PRE>\r\nand Chrome even accepted those weird ligatures I imagined
    as some kind of test after reading the initial post:\r\n<PRE>\r\nlookup ligaStandardLigaturesinLatinloo
    {\r\n  lookupflag 0;\r\n    sub \\A \\B  by \\C;\r\n    sub \\uF0987 \\u100987
    \ by \\Z;\r\n} ligaStandardLigaturesinLatinloo;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  script
    DFLT;\r\n     language dflt ;\r\n      lookup ligaStandardLigaturesinLatinloo;\r\n
    \ script latn;\r\n     language dflt ;\r\n      lookup ligaStandardLigaturesinLatinloo;\r\n}
    liga;\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe font was made with FontForge (with the graphic interface)
    and the above feature file is the output from FontForge (and such a feature file
    can also be used in FontForge with Merge feature file; I prefer using feature
    files for contextual ligatures and alternates but for liga, the graphic interface
    works comfortably). As a conclusion, ligatures are not automatic, and also Chrome
    does not reject disallowed input (I am not sure I like that).\r\n\r\nAll that
    being said, I must confess I am also puzzled by the original post. Concerning
    the letter uni0451, it is normally obtained using a keyboard by first typing a
    key corresponding to dieresis, and then the key corresponding to uni0435; the
    final effect is that a single character is entered into the text, and it is uni0451.
    There is no need of a feature file for that, the keyboard layout sends the right
    character, uni0451, to the text editor. Everything works fine as long as those
    three characters are in the font (and you have the appropriate keyboard).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    drawer\" is gentler, maybe?), but I'll stick with it not being proper Unicode,
    for the following reason. Remember, the consortium put their foot down on assigning
    any more codepoints to accented characters. IIRC, at that time, they allowed they'd
    never intended to give so many accented characters codepoints anyway, such characters
    were <strong>suppose</strong> to be constructed using base characters and combining
    diacritics. "
