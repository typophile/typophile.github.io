  body: 'Well, Greek fonts with many serifs are necessarily inauthentic, so I think
    you just described a very broad field to choose from!  :-&#41; So let me just
    point you to my most favorite Greek font: Apollonia by Takis Katsoulidis. It even
    has a nicely Hellenized Latin component. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Jonathan, <BR> <BR>Can you be more specific about &#34;other type?&#34; What
    is it you&#39;re working on? Do you require polytonic Greek, or is monotonic sufficient
    for your purposes? <BR> <BR>You might begin simply by looking at some samples.
    If you have a copy of Bringhurst close by, that&#39;s a good place to start. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: I presume by sans serif Greek you mean a low contrast Greek with sans serif
    uppercase letters. Serifs are not normal or authentic on Greek lowercase letters.
    <BR> <BR>Jon&#39;s questions are important. With what other types do you want
    this Greek to combine?

  body: Another question - is the text mostly Greek with a few non-Greek words, or
    the other way around?  <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the nature of the text? This may be
    important if you need to choose between a font containing westernized Greek forms
    vs more traditional forms.  <BR> <BR>Si <BR> <BR>

  body: 'This &#34;structural&#34; aspect is indeed the most important factor here.
    Since the vast majority of Greek fonts that have Latin counterparts are merely
    derivations from the Latin, they can only really be used in subordinate roles,
    for example for Greek snippets in a body of English. The other way around &#40;like
    in Apollonia&#41; is very rare, and of course in that case you couldn&#39;t use
    the <i>Latin</i> for a lot of text. Rarer still &#40;I personally don&#39;t know
    of any&#41; would be a Latin and a Greek font that are harmonious at the formal
    visual level, but still authentic and functional on their own - as a result great
    for setting two parallel blocks of text in each script. On the other hand, if
    you find a &#34;stand-alone&#34; authentic Greek font it&#39;s possible you can
    still find a compatible Latin font &#40;although you&#39;ll have to be very lucky
    to closely match the apparent sizes, color, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>Ideally it would
    be great to have two separate fonts, each with two parts: one that&#39;s Greek
    with a subordinate Latin, and one that&#39;s Latin with a subordinate Greek. In
    this way you can accomodate virtually any typographic structure with great harmony,
    but without sacrificing authenticity or functionality. There is only one font
    family like this that I know of...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    &#43; X vs X &#43; Latin approach is a step in the right direction, but is still
    Latin-centric. In an ideal world you&#39;d have a matrix of commonly combined
    languages and have subtly different fonts for each combination. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: 'Simon, you&#39;re right, the structure I describe is just for mixing Latin
    &amp; X in different ways. The &#34;superset&#34; solution is actually like a
    network - so like if you added a third script, you&#39;d need a new font to render
    that script authentically, that font would need <i>two</i> subordinate styles,
    and the two other fonts would need to each get a new subordinate style. Hey, nobody
    said satisfying different cultures was easy...  :-/ <BR> <BR>Jonathan, that sample
    is Adobe Warnock. It&#39;s nice, but still suffers from the classic geometric
    congruence &#40;matching x-height, etc.&#41; issue that goes against the actual
    needs of non-Latin typesetting. The good thing about MM fonts though is that you
    could for example make the Cyrillic slightly larger in point size but compensate
    on the color with the weight axis, and maybe tweak the width axis too. But these
    are things that an intelligent multi-script system should just do by default.
    Adobe&#39;s non-Latin fonts &#40;as well most anybody else&#39;s&#41; also suffer
    from &#34;cognate disease&#34;: having that &#34;a&#34; look exactly the same
    in Latin and Cyrillic might turn on some Swiss folk, but it&#39;s bad for reading,
    and bad for cultural diversity. <BR> <BR>Apollonia: it&#39;s available through
    Cannibal, except their site seems to be down. <BR> <BR>But anyway it sounds like
    you just need a subordinate Greek, and you should have no trouble at finding one
    for Frutiger!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'If you need something to combine with Frutiger, I can thoroughly recommend
    Adobe&#39;s Myriad Pro. The Greek designed for this is one of the best &#39;sans
    serifs&#39; currently available, and Myriad belongs to the same sub-genre of humanistic
    sans as Frutiger. The design is very authentic, and doesn&#39;t sacrifice the
    inherent liveliness and variety of the Greek script to the more rigid and modular
    Latin. <BR> <BR>Another, <i>free</i> option would be the Frutiger Linotype fonts
    that ships with Microsoft&#39;s eBook <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/reader/downloads/pc.asp">Reader</a>.
    This version of Frutiger includes a new Greek; however, the Greek was not designed
    by Adrian Frutiger himself, and I think it suffers from the rigidity of e.g. the
    original Helvetica Greek. It is a sadly missed opportunity, and looks about thirty
    years out of date. Myriad Pro Greek is vastly superior. <BR> <BR>This is what

  body: I&#39;ve just been working a lot on Greek lowercase in the last couple of
    weeks, so this is particularly convenient timing. <BR> <BR>Some of the Frutiger
    LT Greek lowercase glyphs seem almost bizarrely geometric for such a humanist
    face. The gamma, delta, lambda and pi are among those that really leap out as
    being inappropriate. <BR> <BR>It seems odd to me, because with the Greek lowercase
    having such strong calligraphic roots, I&#39;d expect the lowercase to be even
    more humanist than the Latin lowercase, instead of less so. <BR> <BR>The descender
    shapes on zeta and xi both seem what Robert Slimbach would call &#34;wormy.&#34;
    I should know, since he has pointed it out in my own work often enough &#40;mostly
    on the eszett which I can never get right it seems&#41;. The final sigma seems
    to do okay though, on the same shape. <BR> <BR>Do you know who did the Greek for
    Frutiger LT, btw? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
