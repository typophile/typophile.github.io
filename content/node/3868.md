  body: SoftMaker is creating an actual typeface family based on Duracell's current
    logo, "Purcell" (featuring 4 styles - regular, bold, black, and poster black -
    and with the uppercase and lowercase character sets, numbers, symbols, and punctuation
    appearing on these 4 styles), under license from URW++; this font name is appearing
    on both of SoftMaker's premium-quality typeface collections - "MegaFont XXL 3.0"
    and "infiniType 4" - which were being released around May 27, 2014.

  body: for sure mate it is new zealandish, it refers to the small farms &#40;1-50
    acres&#41; for those who are disillusioned with urban/suburban life can go and
    be self-sufficient in. <BR>And yes the indication of overlap is a problem in b
    &amp; w. I wonder if the reference to netting is still as apparent... <BR><IMG

  body: ' Katie - nice work. In color, I get a netting/fenced in feel. <BR> <BR>In
    b&amp;W, the dashes morph into pluses and minuses -- a clever way to convey battery-operated,

    we could see what the net fences look like? <BR> <BR> <BR>I thought maybe the

    <BR> <BR>the type face is Tivoli Gothic Bold. I don&#39;t think i will be using
    it in the final version as it just &#39;have&#39; it on my computer... I don&#39;t

    something that&#39;s referring to electricity. <BR> <BR>my knee jerk reation was
    &#39;dot.com&#39; Especially with a name with &#39;net&#39; in it...unfortunate
    that in the public realm most may think its a web-site or hi-tech co, and not
    referring to the object &#39;net&#39;. I had to read the thread to understand
    the product. <BR> <BR>Alot of my feeling could lay in the lowercase wordmark...again
    any corporate name starting with &#34;e&#34; something gets the techy instinctual
    reaction.  <BR> <BR>If this is how its being presented I would make sure to state
    that the tag line is never removed from the logo '

    exacting. Fencing is sturdy, offers security. '

    <BR>Tanya - is this what you mean? &#40;these are just quick  sketches&#41; <BR>maybe
    i should just make the logo eLECTR@NETS :&#124; <BR>i might test both variations
    out on various people without the tagline and see what they think it is about.

    lower case is working but the upper case is probably more appropriate. In the
    lower case version the centred type &#40;logotype and strapline&#41; work but
    for some reason they dont seem to balance in the upper case one, my eye doesnt
    flow over it if yer get me! Left justified on the &#39;point&#39; of the farthest
    right vertical wire maybe? <BR> <BR>Like it a lot though! Really solid work. '

  body: Katie, <BR>Nice work. I love the concept! A couple of options for your consideration
    - one to make it more fencelike and one to make it more &#34;logo&#34; like. Feel
    free to disregard. &#40;first time uploading a picture - I hope this works&#41;
