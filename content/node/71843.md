  I needed the italic version of this font, I had to purchase Helvetica Neue 46 Light
  Italic. Only problem is that the italic version seems to be slightly larger than
  the non-italic 45 light. I also thought it odd that the italic version of 45 light
  is called 46 light italic.\r\n\r\nJust wondered if anyone else has experienced this
  and whether anyone has any idea of the reason for the size difference.\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  any assistance. "

  body: "Some of the italic letters, like the M, do look wider. \r\nBut the metrics
    -- character widths (including sidebearings) and heights -- are the same.\r\n\r\nThe
    appearance of wideness is due to the fact that for a rhombus and rectangle of
    the same height and base, the rhombus will have longer sides. Note that the stroke
    weights of problematic characters, such as M italic, are slightly less than those
    of the roman, to compensate for this effect.\r\n\r\nThe naming scheme is really
    two systems, alphabetic and numeric.\r\nSo in long form it would read: \"Helvetica
    45: Light Roman\" and Helvetica 46: Light Italic\". \r\n\r\nThe numeric system
    is modern European (after Univers), but the more traditional method was felt necessary
    for the fuddy-duddy numbskulls in North America and elsewhere, just to confuse
    us with both.\r\nIf you think that's bad, try buying timber in Canada, where one
    has to contend with metric and imperial measurements, as well as real and nominal
    size!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the replies and the technical answer,\r\n\r\nI noticed that it's
    the Linotype version of the font that is creating this problem (for both the Light
    and Italic versions). If I instead use the Adobe Systems version of the font,
    ie. for both the Light and Italic versions, I don't get this problem. So it seems
    to be vendor-based."
