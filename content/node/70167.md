  body: My question about how much an automobile costs was not frivolous; the answer
    is "it all depends." The design of the individual characters will dictate how
    much kerning will be needed. Oswald Cooper designed his eponymous black face to
    be cast in metal, without the ability to kern as we know it. Consequently, he
    designed his letters in such a way that kerning--even if it could be accomplished--was
    unnecessary.

    have made some fonts with a lot of kern pairs, others with not many.\r\nAnd my
    \"best practice\" has changed over the years.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to know what
    the figure is \"on average\", you will have to do the calculations yourself, because
    unless someone actually sits down and does that donkey work, all you have is guesswork,
    which even if educated, is a shot in the dark."

  body: 'For a sans with upper & lowercase + kerning classes, I tend to hit in the
    320-380 range. I hadn''t compared or even noticed the number of pairs before.
    I was surprised to see how the numbers end up pretty close. A square sans is about
    220. A superelliptical, like DDT is about 280. My earlier fonts had more pairs,
    probably because my spacing skills weren''t as good. If you eliminate kerning
    classes, the answer is easy: exactly 2048 pairs. Some all caps fonts come in at
    less but everything else is 2048.'

  body: "If you\u2019re talking about the Mac Roman char set and no kerning classes,
    then you\u2019re essentially asking what is the average number of kerning pairs
    in a legacy Postscript Type 1 font.\r\n\r\nStill, it depends. It depends upon
    the style of the design, the effort put into shaping and spacing to obviate kerns
    (not necessarily a good or bad thing, just a design intent), whether the design
    is intended for display or text, and the extent to which a designer chose to go
    (kerning accented chars or not, which punctuation combinations to give attention
    to, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn the original Whitman text fonts, there were around 1800 individual
    kern pairs. In the Display, more like 5000.\r\n\r\nI once did an analysis of some
    rough breakdowns. I can\u2019t find the Whitman analysis; but there is this old
    thread, with data from a few other fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/459#comment-2948\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    many posts from that era end up getting borked in the archive (whenever an accented

    one that seems to have had some really good information (according to the succeeding
    comments) but which got truncated. I can\u2019t remember what I must have said."

  body: "By the way, the reason there are so many kerns in Williams Caslon is because
    its glyph set is very large, including CE characters, Bold Italic small caps,
    swash characters, and 6 styles of figures. You have to do \"exceptions\" for the
    accents, and the swash are kerned to both lower case and small caps. So everything
    explodes exponentially with more characters that need to be kerned with one another.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the italic follows the varied slants of the original (though all is made 3% more
    upright). I think because of the varied slants, it took a lot more kerning to
    get the evenness of a modern italic. There are about double the kerns in the italic
    as the roman. \r\n\r\nAlso this follows the FB method of not putting negative
    side bearings in vwxy, so that they won't touch even if kerning isn't operating.
    This creates a need for more kerning to get the diagonal characters even in the
    final.   "

    fonts that do not have kerns. And the number of kerning pairs in a font dot not

    kerning pairs in an OTF? When I first started making OTFs about 7 years ago, I
    didn''t set a limit when expanding class based kerning. Some fonts would expand
    to about 10 kilopairs. When testing  in Adobe CS1 apps, the kerning didn''t work
    at all. So I capped the limit to a couple of kilopairs and all was well. What
    is to actual breaking point for kerning pairs in an OTF?'

  body: "Some apps don't support class based kerning. So even basic stuff like commas,
    emdashes, ellipsis, base quotes and smart quotes would end up unkerned in those
    apps if the class kerning wasn't at least somewhat expanded. For all caps fonts,
    unexpanded kerning meant the \"lowercase\" set ended up with no kerning at all.
    For the first few years of OTF, MyFonts samples didn't display class based kerning.
    If you didn't expand the kerning, I'd only see the class parents kerned.\r\n\r\nNow,
    with web embedding, class kerning isn't fully supported so, if I don't expand
    kerning, it won't kern.\r\n\r\nIn earlier OTF times, there was an OS9 app that
    supported OTF but not kerning classes. I can't remember which one but a few customers
    mentioned it so I made sure I expanded everything.\r\n\r\nIn Windows there was
    something . . . Corel Draw? I think there was a version that supported OTF but

  body: "<cite>what's the technical limit for the number of kerning pairs in an OTF?</cite>\r\n\r\nThere's
    no simple number. The format is limited by the size of a subtable (64kb), though
    we now have the \"extension\" mechanism to work around that, in newer environments.
    Some individual applications will start to misbehave if some limit is exceeded,
    but the nature of that misbehavior and the size of the limit can vary by app and
    even by app version. Some applications have no limit whatsoever (for example,
    InDesign).\r\n\r\nExamples of different kinds of misbehavior:\r\n\r\n- only recognizing
    the first <em>n</em> pairs\r\n- only recognizing the last <em>n</em> pairs\r\n-
    the app crashes\r\n- the app fails to recognize any kerning in the font\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    Adobe notified all the application developers whose apps they saw misbehaving,
    about 8-10 years ago. I know that Framemaker and QuarkXPress improved.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
