body: I spent several hours over the last couple of days on this one. I thought I
  would share in case anyone else has this problem. I created a kern feature in FontLab,
  but upon export the kerning wouldn't show up in either OSX Cocoa apps or the Adobe
  apps. When I reimported the exported fonts in FontLab, the kern feature was still
  there. The solution? For some reason the system wouldn't show the kern feature unless
  I added another feature, in this case a simple ligature feature. Go figure.

  body: That gets mentioned from time to time in Build threads. It's unfortunate you
    missed those, but props for figuring it out and sharing.

  body: I saw some of those threads after I posted :-/ As soon as I figured it out,
    it seemed familiar. Based on the fact that I've spent a fair amount of time reading
    OpenType specs, and it still took me a few days to figure it out, I'm sure it
    doesn't hurt to bring it up again :-) Cool that it's fixed in CS3.
