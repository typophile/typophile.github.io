    not Switzerland. In lowercase/mixed-cased setting it can\u2019t be replaced by
    anything else. It has a distinct phonetic purpose. (Unlike the f-i ligature for
    example)\r\nSo no text or layout application should do a \xDF \u2192  ss or ss
    \u2192 \xDF conversion. This would be as useful as doing an automatic f \u2192
    ph substitution. It doesn\u2019t make any sense and it is not included in any
    OpenType feature code as well.\r\n\r\nThere are however reasons to make this conversion:\r\na)
    When text should be converted to ASCII, like for international travel papers,
    bank transactions and so on. Then European diacritical marks are then replaced
    (\xF6 \u2192 oe and \xDF \u2192 ss).\r\n\r\nb) Uppercase writing. Traditionally
    there was no uppercase \xDF (\u1E9E). The unicode for it has just been assigned
    4 years ago and the official orthography in Germany and Austria still uses SS
    as official replacement, so \u201Cgro\xDF\u201D would become \u201CGROSS\u201D.
    Applications might have this replacement hardcoded in their text engine, so text
    that is transformed automatically to uppercase writing will have this transformation
    applied automatically. When you use an uppercase-only font, the slot for the \xDF
    character will therefore likely have a SS in it. \r\nYou can find some more articles

    did the reverse, i.e., replaced the 'ss' by '\xDF'. Wouldn't that be helpful?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo,
    because German, especially since the spelling reform of the 1990s, makes a spelling
    distinction between 'ss' and '\xDF' in lowercase, i.e. conversion between them
    is not reliable without dictionary support.\r\n\r\nRe. Arabic and other decomposition:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft
    Word provides an option to differentially colour diacritic signs. This is based
    on identification of the signs as 'marks' in the font GDEF table. In order that
    this feature might apply consistently to all diacritic signs, including those
    that are part of precomposed combinations such as alif+hamza, these combinations
    are decomposed in the ccmp feature of some fonts.\r\n\r\nThis functionality depends
    on the font a) decomposing precomposed combinations and b) correct identification
    of the decomposed diacritics as marks in the GDEF table. Most likely one also
    wants correct anchor positioning attachment for these marks in the GPOS table.\r\n\r\nNote
    that although, as you've discovered, it is possible to apply this Word coloured-diacritic
    function to Latin text, it exists primarily to support Arabic, in which differentially
    colouring marks has a very long history, dating back to the earliest Koran manuscripts
    and the early development of the script.\r\n\r\n[You may also notice that in some
    fonts ccmp is used to <em>contextually</em> decompose precomposed diacritic glyphs
    when they are followed by additional combining mark characters. This is done so
    that GPOS mark-to-base positioning does not need to be defined in the font for
    every precomposed glyph. So, for instance, a font might decompose \xEB when followed
    by \u0301 (combining acute) so that, instead of applying a 'mark' feature lookup
    of the combining mark to the precomposed diacritic, the sequence can be displayed
    as a 'mark' positioning of a combining diaeresis on the e, followed by a 'mkmk'
    positioning of the acute to the diaeresis: \xEB\u0301 (which may or may not render
    nicely in your browser).\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is a nasty bug in current versions
    of InDesign that causes such ccmp contextual decompositions to fail. Unfortunately,
    I didn't get this bug diagnosed and reported to Adobe in time for it to be fixed
    in the new CS6.]"

    the alif + hamza, note that the dotted ring is inserted dynamically in whatever

    this is a sequence of letter plus combining mark. In actual text using a font
