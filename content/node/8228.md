body: Hello, <BR> <BR>The forums have been acting quite strangely in the last few
  days. I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve already posted this thread. <BR> <BR>Anyway, not
  having illustrator or and equivalent has me trying to create fonts using pixels
  for now. Until I get a computer &#40;soon, hopefully&#41; this is what it has to
  be. Unless, someone knows of a workable and free alternative to illustrator &#40;or
  freehand for that matter&#41; for drawing outlines. <BR> <BR>So, here is what I
  have been working on until I can turn it into a conventional font using a program
  such as illustrator. <BR> <BR>I guess try to imagine it as not being a bitmap. I
  suppose that using paths will totally change its appearance, however. Well, this
  is it for now. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56124.gif"

  body: Christopher, if you have access to a machine running Linux then Inkscape and
    SodiPodi and Skencil some to mind. These are vector drawing prgrams. To me Inkcape
    is the most comfortable &#40;I&#39;m an Illustartor user for most of my regualr
    workaday employment&#41;. If you don&#39;t have access to a computer then none
    of these will really help. Also on linux for free is Font Forge for drawing and
    making fonts. <BR> <BR>But really, what with the other stuff you have shown here
    and in the other categories, I&#39;d keep going down the bitmap road and feel
    good about it. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: You need not have Linux to run the open-source programs Jon mentioned, though.
    <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and <a href="http://www.sodipodi.com">SodiPodi</a>
    both run on Windows and in the X environment on Mac OS X. FontForge will run in
    the X environment of Mac OS X and under Cygwin on Windows, too.

  body: Steve, <BR>Thankyou very much for those links! I&#39;ve felt absolutely paralysed
    having no means of designing anything.  There seems to be a shortage of the G5
    I want; I&#39;m stuck on my Dad&#39;s PC. Well, back to the drawing board with
    a vengeance! <BR> <BR>John, <BR>Just this evening I began work on another pixel
    font, with a few greys for added precision. Spacing pixel fonts properly &#40;even
    when you are making them in phoshop itself&#41; is damn-near impossible :-S.   Quite
    fun, though. <BR> <BR>Me and my little brother are working on some HTML compositing
    ideas. He has made up a system where you type a word and it will set that word
    using the font. However, the future of this seems grim where the typeface is not
    monospaced. hmm. more on this later. Watch this space. Or, well the pixel threads,
    perhaps.

  body: Indeed, Steve speak the truth. I myself run these application under X Windows
    on my Mac using a combination of Apple&#39;s X11 and Fink. <BR> <BR><i>Spacing
    pixel fonts properly &#40;even when you are making them in phoshop itself&#41;
    is damn-near impossible</i> <BR>I have to say though that getting down close like
    that will probably give you an eye for hinting and kerning outlines...stuff I
    have yet to learn. <BR> <BR>Hang in there man. I hope you get a machine soon.

    you really want that?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>It seems to me that if this is really
    just a placeholder for an outline font, you&#39;re effectively drawing skeletons
    or something. Or at least you&#39;re imposing some quite peculiar &#40;but possible
    nicely exploratory&#41; restrictions on the results... Hmmm. <BR> <BR>Spacing
    bitmaps: <BR>It&#39;s a very discrete &#40;and sometimes discreat!&#41; exercise,
    where some global &#34;on-off&#34; type decisions have to be made before you do
    much actualy work. And grays don&#39;t alleviate the &#34;problem&#34;, they just
    spin it into a third dimension... or something. Damned if I know what that means...
    Hmmm, just do it dude! <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Mr Washer, I presume? I hope graduation went well for you! Good luck finding
    gainful and rewarding employment.  <BR> <BR>No comp? In the meantime, get a pencil
    and lotsa paper, and draw. Seriously, Downtown Brown was right. I have been doing
    it <a href="http://klim.co.nz/content/notebook_type3.html"> a lot!</a> Maybe we
    can compare notebooks sometimes these holidays.

  body: Ah, hi there Kris. <BR> <BR>I managed to find myself a 20&#34; iMac amidst
    big waiting lists all over the place. Told them to hold it, then they got six
    calls and 2 customers wanting to buy it, within few hours. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been
    sketching a few things recently; i&#39;ll find myself some web space and perhaps
    put up a few pages. After seeing the &#34;A Ghost is Born&#34; I saw the modest
    mouse things coming a mile away! I like the &#34;the good times are killing me&#34;
    one. <BR> <BR>My brother has finished a basic version of this pixel font composition.
    It has the ability to add ligatures &#40;which is essential with the troublesome
    spacing associated with pixel fonts&#41;. More on this later, especially since
    I&#39;ve only made a lower case font for it. Caps is on the way. -- I just had
    a suggestion for him regarding ligatures...  <BR> <BR>Hrant, <BR>I think you are
    right about the skeleton thing; if I am going to design in a conventional manner
    then I should most likely &#34;keep it real&#34; and put pencil to paper. I think
    I just get a real kick out of pixel-pushing. Er, rock on. Or something. <BR> <BR>-
    on another note <BR>Does anyone know of a free alternative to suitcase? I cant
    stand it moving my fonts to those giant communual system font folders. I shoudl
    find a font previewer perhaps... <BR> <BR>- Chris
