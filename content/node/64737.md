  a useful mobile experience for Typophile \u2014 for those moments when you're on
  the go and want to get a quick snapshot of what's happening. The design allows you
  to quickly browse through the latest posts, and jump to the site to get involved
  if something catches your eye.\r\n\r\nIt's just a start, but the project has already
  undergone a number of improvements and revisions, and I'd love to get your thoughts
  for where you'd like to see it evolve.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/m\r\n\r\nScreenshots

    user tracking page to see if new comments have appeared in any threads I'm participating
    in.

    \u201CLaunch site\u201D? Launch what site? Where? Precision in terminology would
    be helpful.\r\n\r\nPlease explain further if you are one of the shadowy \u201Cmoderators\u201D
    of this site and if such CSS changes will be permanent.\r\n\r\nAlso, <code>m.typophile.com</code>
    is the generally accepted domain nomenclature. <code>/m</code> is not wrong, just
    unnecessarily different. The site should auto-detect a mobile device, show you
    the mobile-optimized version, and give you a link back to the conventional version.
    (Sadly, this is where we\u2019ve arrived a decade after the <code>handheld</code>
    CSS media type was invented.)\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

  body: "How about \"thank you\"?\r\nCool thing, Jared. It's nice not to have to zoom
    and scroll all the time!\r\n\r\nI wonder how much information that little screen
    can take. I mean in the overview (the first screenshot you show above) it'd be
    cool to see which Forum a post is in, and/or see more than one line of preview
    text. And maybe a \"updated\" time stamp to see what's new? But maybe that's already
    too much to squeeze on that screen.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- I second that being able
    to access one's own user tracking list would be nice. \r\n- I agree that \"Launch
    Site\" is a bit weird in terms of wording, but it's nice to have that option so
    close.\r\n- The loading indicator is super sweet! :)"

    bit of the header, by aligning the name and the searchfield. The more real content,
    the better. Maybe with a single line right on the bottom of the T-square (no shadow,
    that is so 2.0).\r\n\r\nMainpage:\r\nTighten up the top here, too. Nav-buttons
    also -- could be less high, with less real-estate above and under.\r\n\r\nUlterior
    motive: more space for content. Functionality before beauty. Or whatever.\r\n\r\n

  body: "The mobile version is very nice as far as it goes, but it's disappointing
    that you can't access the whole site in the same manner, just topics and main
    posts. \r\n\r\nI'm used to the way the standard Typophile pages work on the iPhone.
    The most awkward aspects are the pages that list topics, because they have a wide
    fixed width, and the text entry boxes for posting comments, which are also way
    too wide. Reading topic posts is okay, unless you want to see the name and avatar
    of the poster at the same time. Viewing the site in horizontal orientation helps,
    but I prefer reading in portrait orientation--less scrolling.\r\n\r\nIf the \"normal\"
    site was designed a bit differently, I don't think there would be much need for
    a custom mobile version, at least for the iPhone. "

  body: I would love to see a function somewhere in between the current "Track" function
    and Twitter. Basically you could follow people like on Twitter, and it would aggregate
    their posts into one section, like how TweetDeck does it. So maybe you open up
    the Typophile app, and like with tweetdeck, the first window is akin to the normal
    Typophile homepage; you scroll to the right, and this window has all your posts
    and marks new replies; you scroll to the next window and it has all the people
    you're following.
