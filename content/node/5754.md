  <BR> <BR>This is the closest I&#39;ve found: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/paper-boy-bb/bold/testdrive.html?s=Harris%2BTeeter&amp;p=48"

  <BR> <BR>However, several characters are slightly or totally wrong.  I have the
  capability to edit it &#40;this will be used to generate a text spline in 3dsmax&#41;.'

  body: Though not my taste, I&#39;m glad this is still available. I did a search
    and I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere. Thanks Mike.

  body: For a while most of the FontHaus fonts, including Panache &#40;who makes Sixpack
    &amp; Stanley&#41;, were carried as part of Agfa&#39;s Creative Alliance, now
    you have to go to FontHaus to find all of them. Apparently Agfa still has some
    of the fonts, but not all the ones they used to have. &#40;BTW, Panache used to
    be &#39;Panache Typography&#39;, but now I see it is called &#39;Panache Graphics&#39;
    -- same fonts.&#41;
