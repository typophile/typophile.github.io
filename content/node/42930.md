body: The font design I am currently working on is too short within the em quad and
  I want to enlarge it. I think that the easiest way to do this is to determine the
  new cap height,  what percentage to enlarge the letters to fit the new height, have
  Fontlab scale all the letters from the lower-left corner to meet the new height,
  and then fix the letters with descenders and space the font. Is this a good way
  to proceed?

  body: "You could also just reduce the size of the em, i.e. set the UPM value to
    a smaller size. If you are making a TTF or OTF, the UPM value can be any positive
    integer value. This approach avoids outline scaling rounding errors within your
    font source.\r\n\r\nIf taking this approach, be sure to turn OFF the option to
    scale all glyphs to the new UPM in the FontLab FontInfo dialogue."

  body: Michael, make sure you don't check "Scale all glyphs according to UPM size
    change" when you change the UPM. Otherwise, the relative size of the glyphs to
    the UPM will remain the same and the font will appear exactly the same size as
    before in applications. With the box checked, changing the UPM, in effect, simply
    changes the resolution of your font. With the box unchecked, changing the UPM
    changes the size of the glyphs relative to the type size.

    change it in the Glyph editing window (assuming you haven't locked the vertical
    measurements layer). I also second Hrant's advice.

  body: "\"I\u2019ll tweak the UPM. Thanks for the help!\"\r\n(well maybe) It depends
    if you want the scaling to be accomplished under your watchful eye, or any old
    way.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that if your details, or the target resolution
    is going to create scaling artifacts, be careful: \"Reducing the UPM without scaling
    the outlines will have the same optical effect as scaling up the outlines without
    changing the UPM\"\r\nThis is, after all what hinting is for so if the Adam statement
    is always true, hinting would never be required. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: So what you're basically saying, David, is not to scale UPM, right? Not that
    I would ever do such a thing. Wasn't there some calligraphic font that was scaled
    to 256 or something nuts like that? And caused a lot of problems? It's the only
    commercial PS font I can think of that did that. For what it's worth, and I think
    it's worth a lot, Robert Slimbach uses scaling constantly in his editing. Not
    just scaling characters, but using scaling to widen, narrow, to alter selected
    features, etc. He's marvellously creative with it, and never seems to worry about
    the artefacts.

  body: ">told what the stem widths etc. are supposed to be\r\n\r\nHaving uniform
    stem widths may be less important than you think. When I first presented the rather
    raw data of my 'Valerie' typeface to Adobe, I said, well, you know, this is pretty
    rough, so I guess the first thing to do is to measure the stem widths and regularize
    them. Robert and Carol were horrified and forbade it. 'Leave the stems as they
    are; they look OK to us; trust your eye' basically sums up what they said. Obviously
    this approach will not work for all typefaces, but it is amazing how many it <em>will</em>
    work for. "

  body: "My suspicion is that perfectly consistent stem widths are a non-issue at
    imagesetter resolutions and much more of an issue at screen resolution. But perhaps
    even then tiny inconsistencies can result in a more organic and less sterile typeface.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I think the average would-be type designer would benefit from first
    learning the discipline of consistency and then later figuring out when, how,
    and how much to deviate from it. Sort of like learning how to balance letters,
    where first you need to figure out what makes letters seem optically balanced
    and then decide when it's okay to be a bit off-balance to increase the liveliness
    of the typeface.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
