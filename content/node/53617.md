  Borders today, looking at only the covers of books and happened upon this one. It's
  L. Frank Baum's \"The Wizard of Oz,\" illustrated by Graham Rawle. Inside the book
  the story is told experimenting with fonts and sizes, while the images are collaged.
  I really wanted to buy the book, but I didn't have the money on me. :[ \r\n\r\nI
  really did enjoy the collage aspect with the images and the text pull outs and just
  the use of fonts and sizes. Really fun way to tell the story of The Wizard of Oz."
