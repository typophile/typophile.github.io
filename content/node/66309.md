  body: "I think it's very similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo-dos-pro/|Camingo
    Dos]], which has an alternate g like the sample. However, the W does not match
    in upper or lower case. The sample shows a lower centerpoint than Camingo has
    for its w's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Here's why I thought Camingo was close (it's the bottom one. Soho is on top.).
    It was hard to match sample sizes from two different site test drives, but you
    get the idea. The W,w difference, the way the y tail connects, and the i dots
    are the only immediately obvious differences to me (recognizing that I lack the
    calibrated eyeballs of some of you folks) :-)\r\n\r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Soho-Camingo_4590.gif]"

  body: Mike, I hope that this problem will get solved soon. I linked to an older
    Type ID thread about the same sample.
