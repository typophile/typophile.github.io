  body: "Plasticsandal, Bickham Script Pro is the typeface--the \"alt capitals\" to
    which Don refers are alternate glyphs that are part of the Opentype options for
    that font (though if you are going with letterpress, you might want to use a heavier
    weight than the one displayed below):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bickham_4567.png]"
