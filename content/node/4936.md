  had buried the Bold weights inside Freehand&#39;s &#40;or any other app, I&#39;m
  sure&#41; character attributes dropdown menu. I found that a little odd. More importantly,
  I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m gonna have RIP problems down the road. <BR> <BR>Your

  body: Dylan, I would be willing to bet if you approached Ricardo via email he would
    give you separate files for the bold. To test the RIP issues you could always
    sent a file to your service bureau for testing. Most RIPs allow the process without
    the actual imaging,

  body: Despite propaganda to the contrary, there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with
    style linking. You just have to make sure that the fonts given to the output provider
    include the bold &#40;which may mean the whole family, depending on format and
    how they&#39;re built&#41;. <BR> <BR>As long as you do that, you&#39;re fine.
    Any statement to the contrary is ignorant superstition &#40;though there&#39;s
    plenty of it around&#41;. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks, Tiffany and Thomas... the Trusty T&#39;s strike again &#40;er, something
    like that&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh, for what it&#39;s worth, I plan to use Van for an
    upscale road bike shop&#39;s website. <BR> <BR>Again, thanks for the feedback.

    more user-friendly? <BR>

  body: Hello Dylan, about your question Thomas already respondedYou will not have
    problems with the RIPs. But anyway try to send a file to your service bureau like
    Tiffany suggest. Van Condensed works normally to different software

  body: Thanks, Ricardo, for building Van. I&#39;m really looking forward to working
    with it! <BR> <BR>To build the bike shop&#39;s website, I&#39;ll be using Van
    Condensed in Photoshop, &#39;chopping&#39; those graphics and then building the
    site with Dreamweaver. <BR> <BR>In my opinion, I don&#39;t think you need to redo
    anything as far as the fonts being style-linked or not. Just haven&#39;t seen
    a font style-linked in a while, so it threw me off. <BR> <BR>Thanks! Happy Thursday,
    everyone.
