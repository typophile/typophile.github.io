    (it's hard to tell), and there aren't any other repeating characters.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Hey Lex,\r\n\r\nThanks for your post. With this type of sample it can always
    be hand lettered, and its certainly not easy to tell with such a small example,
    but I *think* the a's and the e's look like they are the same... I could definitley
    be wrong.\r\n\r\nDo you (or anyone) have some good substitutes that might work
    instead? Thanks!"

  body: These are the people who do the Mac version of KidPix, a program my daughter
    has. I looked at the CD package and it does appear to be a font--the a's and e's
    are identical. Don't know what it is, though.
