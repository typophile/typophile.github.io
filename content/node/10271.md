  <BR> <BR>Anyone know more about that? I&#39;m a bit confused as to what it going
  on. Is MS no longer bundling these fonts with their OS/Applications? Or is this
  just an alternative way to obtain the fonts? I&#39;m wondering why MS would even
  do this...it certainly makes them less appealing as web font options in the future.'

  body: The Web fonts are still being included with Windows and other systems under
    license.  <BR> <BR>Ascender is able to provide Type 1 and OpenType CFF versions
    to designers and others. They can also provide latest versions to those that need
    them but don&#39;t want to upgrade their OS. <BR> <BR>They can also license them
    to software and hardware makers for inclusion in their products. They can also
    provide custom versions of the fonts if customers need them. <BR> <BR>Basic reason
    for doing this is because Microsoft isn&#39;t in the end user font licensing or
    custom font production business and Ascender is.    <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Ah, I guess that makes sense. Would have been nice for MS to just OS them,
    but well, OS and MS don&#39;t go together, so I guess I don&#39;t blame them.

  body: Nick, from the outset that was one of the ideas we had. There are designers
    and companies that would love to get access to intermediate weights of Verdana
    for example. Ascender is free to make these but are not obligated to do so. Under
    the agreement they have a lot of flexibility. I hope they see demand for these
    and respond to it. <BR> <BR>True with respect to OSS. But one of our motivations
    was to restore some perceived value in these fonts, which are seen by a lot of
    people as having little value. Putting them into the public domain wouldn&#39;t
    have helped this.  <BR> <BR>Also there&#39;s the issue of quality, Ascender are
    one of the few companies we&#39;d trust to maintain quality in extensions and
    additions. Tom Rickner for example is quite rightly associated with Verdana and
    Georgia as he hinted them. I don&#39;t think the OSS community has the people
    and tools needed to maintain that level of quality.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

    <BR> <BR>Just MHO, but the general populace doesn&#39;t put much value in any
    fonts. For web developers, though, the web fonts MS released were an invaluable
    contribution to the web. I&#39;m not fan of MS, but once in a while they produce
    some great stuff, and this was one of them. Going the OS route would have brought
    a LOT more perceived value to the web development community. &#40;Again, IMHO&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Good point about quality, though...granted, the OS license could have
    had any number of contigencies &#40;like MS retain source code maintenance oversight&#41;
    or something. Public Domain probably wouldn&#39;t have been a good option.'
