body: "Hi - I was wondering if anyone would be able to suggest some fonts that would
  work well with a boudoir / sexy / erotic theme. It's for an on-line project  - kinda
  Agent provocateur in tone but a little more mainstream. Are script fonts the best
  way to achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: I'd say Script or tall/thin Serif(s). (The first that come to mind for feminine
    and sexy type probably is/are <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com" target="_blank">Sudtipos</a>
    and maybe <a href="http://www.wiescher-design.de" target="_blank">Wiescher</a>.)

    so subjective, this could be altogether wrong ;-)"
