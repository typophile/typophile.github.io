  body: Looks like someone filled in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_bauhaus_std_complete_pack/?&sample_text=enedge&sample_size=48&affid=99346">ITC
    Bauhaus</a>. A better option would be <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet/viewfonts">Chalet</a>.

  body: You're awesome!  Thanks - yes it's ITC Bauhaus filled in, Chalet's "r" (which
    I didn't give you) doesn't match.  You win the cigar.  Cheers.
