  in Fontlab that we generated as OTF. We've been using the font for development in
  Word and InDesign, all seems to be well.\r\n\r\nWe're now ready to start using it
  in actual production and the client had decided to change the name.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign
  when I change from the old font to the new font in, which nothing but the name has
  been changed (I'm nearly sure!), the cursor in InDesign shifts up just a hair. Nothing
  else is changing, text isn't rerunning and auto leading doesn't seem to be affected,
  just the position of the cursor.\r\n\r\nI'm not the only one who works with these
  Fontlab files and I'm a bit concerned that something has been inadvertanly changed.
  The only thing I do have going for me is that we've not yet typeset anything with
  the new font except the samples, which seem to be fine.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  what InD looks at to determine the vertical position of the curosor?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"
