  a cropped version of it...\r\nthe text also has got a diffuse glow filter on it.\r\n\r\nIts
  most likely to be a Garamond, but could not match it with any Garamond I got\r\nthe
  serifs are quite small\r\nD has a wider bowl, also its shoulder is thicker at top\r\n\r\nplz
  help identifying it,\r\nthanks for your time"
