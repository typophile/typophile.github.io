  body: "Thanks, Ben, I will let my client know this. We designed a whole publication
    using the open type version and were unable to make PDFs suitable for our printer
    with it. Some problem with their system, I guess, but it was a problem nonetheless\r\n\r\nPhyllis"

  body: Back in the day, and assuming you are using something older than Quark 6,
    I had to make my PDFs by saving the files as .PS and running them through Distiller
    to get them to work properly.

  body: With Quark 6 I find it easier to use the Print dialogue box to make PDFs rather
    than "export to pdf" but I think my Quark is wonky.
