  makes the EULA binding and enforceable, given your local laws regarding contracts,
  standard agreements, consumer rights, and EULAs in particular; and also the intellectual
  property and fair use laws?\r\n\r\n(For example, I recall a case where a student

    their customer, the customer really has two choices if they don't like the terms
    of the agreement - they can either ignore it in the knowledge that there will
    likely be no repercussions, or they can take their business elsewhere. A third
    option, the one usually mentioned here, is to talk to the font maker and try and
    work something out. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: Si, thanks for that, but I am raising a legal issue here. There is a strong
    argument to be made that a EULA is NOT a written agreement between a maker and
    a consumer, and also that the agreement may not be binding or enforceable. For
    comparison, the sign at the entrance to a parking garage may say that by paying
    and entering the driver assumes all liability and waives all claims against the
    owner/operator - and while the consumer has the option to take her business elsewhere,
    the law in some jurisdictions is that the notice has no effect no matter how phrased.

    also think given typeface's unique position with respect to IP law a specialist

    contract such as this, does not exhaust, or even accurately reflects, the rights
    of the parties.\r\n\r\nSo, sure, I'm making a legal argument (my legal training
    is in fact quite extensive, so I definitely do not condone piracy), but isn't
    it important to all of you? Why do you automatically assume that if a EULA says
    something you have to abide by it?"

    but didn\u2019t find anything convincing either way.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniels:\r\n>
    Yikes! Maybe I should change my icon! \r\n\r\nThe problem with Typophile is that,
    whenever someone asks a serious question, for instance here about the validity
    of EULAs, the discussion usually very fast degenerates into off-topics such as\r\n\r\n-
    Wow, a nice typeface\r\n- I should redesign my logo\r\n- I prefer beer brewed

    The reason why Microsoft (the corporation Mr. Daniels is working for) is under
    constant supervision by the European Union as a law breaker is because Microsoft
    is stubbornly breaking European law.\r\n\r\nMemorize this:\r\n\r\n*** Whoever
    thinks EULAs of font outfits are legal and valid ***\r\n*** should have his head
    examined by a shrink in a loony bin. ***\r\n\r\nBelow I attach an English translation
    of the section of the German Civil Code containing a long list of illegal and
    invalid provisions in EULAs.\r\n\r\nGerman Civil Code - B\xFCrgerliches Gesetzbuch
    (Excerpt)\r\n...\r\nSection 2: Shaping contractual obligations by means of standard
    business terms\r\n\r\n\xA7 305 Incorporation of standard business terms into the
    contract\r\n(1) Standard business terms are all contractual terms pre-established
    for a multitude of contracts which one party to the contract (the user) presents
    to the other party upon the conclusion of the contract. It is irrelevant whether
    the provisions appear as a separate part of a contract or are included in the
    contractual document itself, how extensive they are, what script is used for them,
    or what form the contract takes. Contractual terms do not constitute standard
    business terms where they have been individually negotiated between the parties.\r\n(2)
    Standard business terms are incorporated into the contract only if, during the
    conclusion of the contract, the user\r\n1. expressly draws the other party's attention
    to them, or if, on account of the way in which the contract is concluded, an express
    reference to them is unreasonably difficult, he draws his attention to them by
    means of a clearly visible sign at the place where the contract is concluded and\r\n2.
    gives the other party, in a reasonable manner that also appropriately takes account
    of any physical handicap of the other party discernible by the user, the possibility
    of gaining knowledge of their content,\r\nand if the other party agrees that they
    are to apply.\r\n(3) Subject to observance of the requirements set out in subsection
    (2) above, the parties may agree in advance that particular standard business
    terms will apply to a particular type of legal transaction.\r\n\r\n\xA7 305a Incorporation
    in special cases\r\n...\r\n\r\n\xA7 305b Precedence of individually negotiated
    terms\r\nIndividually negotiated terms take precedence over standard business
    terms.\r\n\r\n\xA7 305c Surprising and ambiguous clauses\r\n(1) Provisions in
    standard business terms which in the circumstances, in particular in view of the
    outward appearance of the contract, are so unusual that the contractual partner
    of the user could not be expected to have reckoned with them, do not form part
    of the contract.\r\n(2) In case of doubt, standard business terms are interpreted
    against the user.\r\n\r\n\xA7 306 Legal consequences of non-incorporation and
    invalidity\r\n(1) If all or some standard business terms have not become part
    of the contract or are invalid, the remainder of the contract continues to be
    valid.\r\n(2) Where provisions have not become part of the contract or are invalid,
    the content of the contract is determined by the statutory rules.\r\n(3) The contract
    is invalid if one party would suffer unreasonable hardship if he were bound by
    the contract even after the amendment provided for in subsection (2) above.\r\n\r\n\xA7
    306a No circumvention\r\nThe rules in this section apply even if they are circumvented
    by other arrangements.\r\n\r\n\xA7 307 Review of subject-matter\r\n(1) Provisions
    in standard business terms are invalid if, contrary to the requirement of good
    faith, they place the contractual partner of the user at an unreasonable disadvantage.
    An unreasonable disadvantage may also result from the fact that the provision
    is not clear and comprehensible.\r\n(2) In case of doubt, an unreasonable disadvantage
    is assumed if a provision\r\n1. cannot be reconciled with essential basic principles
    of the statutory rule from which it deviates, or\r\n2. restricts essential rights
    or duties resulting from the nature of the contract in such a manner that there
    is a risk that the purpose of the contract will not be achieved.\r\n(3) Subsections
    (1) and (2) above, and \xA7\xA7 308 and 309 apply only to provisions in standard
    business terms by means of which provisions derogating from legal rules or provisions
    supplementing those rules are agreed. Other provisions may be invalid under subsection
    (1), sentence 2, above, in conjunction with subsection (1), sentence 1, above.\r\n\r\n\xA7
    308 Clauses whose validity depends on an appraisal\r\nIn standard business terms
    the following terms, in particular, are invalid:\r\n1. (period for acceptance
    or performance)\r\na provision by which the user reserves the right to an unreasonably
    long or inadequately specified period for acceptance or rejection of an offer
    or for performance; this does not include reservation of the right to perform
    only after expiry of the period for revocation or return under \xA7\xA7 355 (1)
    and (2) and 356;\r\n2. (additional period for performance)\r\na provision by which
    the user, in derogation from legislative provisions, reserves the right to an
    unreasonably long or inadequately specified additional period within which to
    perform;\r\n3. (right of termination)\r\nthe stipulation of a right for the user
    to free himself, without an objectively justified reason specified in the contract,
    of his duty to perform; this does not apply to a contract for the performance
    of a recurring obligation;\r\n4. (right of amendment)\r\nthe stipulation of the
    user's right to alter or depart from the promised performance, unless, taking
    into account the user's interests, the stipulation to alter or depart from performance
    is reasonable for the other party;\r\n5. (fictitious declarations)\r\na provision
    whereby a declaration of the user's contractual partner is deemed or not deemed
    to have been made by him if he does or fails to do a particular act, unless\r\na)
    he is allowed a reasonable period within which to make an express declaration
    and\r\nb) the user undertakes to draw to his attention at the beginning of the
    period the particular significance of his conduct; this does not apply to contracts
    in which the whole of Part B of the contracting rules for award of public works
    contracts is incorporated;\r\n6. (fictional receipt)\r\na provision which provides
    that a declaration by the user of particular importance is deemed to have been
    received by the other party;\r\n7. (winding-up of contracts)\r\na provision by
    which, in the event that one of the parties to the contract terminates the contract
    or gives notice to terminate it, the user can demand\r\na) unreasonably high remuneration
    for the utilisation or use of a thing or a right or for performance made, or\r\nb)
    unreasonably high reimbursement of expenditure;\r\n8. (unavailability of the object
    of performance)\r\na stipulation permitted under 3. above of the user's right
    to free himself of his obligation to perform the contract if the object of the
    performance is not available, unless the user agrees\r\na) to inform the other
    party immediately of the unavailability, and\r\nb) immediately to refund counter-performance
    by that party.\r\n\r\n\xA7 309 Clauses whose invalidity is not subject to any
    appraisal\r\nEven where derogation from the statutory provisions is permissible,
    the following are invalid in standard business terms:\r\n1. (price increases at
    short notice)\r\na provision which provides for an increase in the remuneration
    for goods or services that are to be supplied within four months of the conclusion
    of the contract; this does not apply to goods or services supplied in the course
    of a recurring obligation;\r\n2. (right to refuse to perform)\r\na provision by
    which\r\na) the right under \xA7 320 of the contractual partner of the user to
    refuse to perform is excluded or restricted, or\r\nb) a right of retention of
    the contractual partner of the user, in so far as it arises from the same contractual
    relationship, is excluded or restricted, in particular by making it subject to
    recognition by the user of the existence of defects;\r\n3. (prohibition of set-off)\r\na
    provision by which the contractual partner of the user is deprived of the right
    to set off a claim which is undisputed or has been declared final and absolute;\r\n4.
    (notice, period for performance)\r\na provision by which the user is relieved
    of the statutory requirement to give notice to the other party to perform or to
    fix a period for performance or supplementary performance by him;\r\n5. (lump-sum
    claims for damages)\r\nstipulation of a lump-sum claim by the user for damages
    or for compensation for reduction in value, if\r\na) the lump sum in the cases
    in question exceeds the damage expected in the normal course of events or the
    reduction in value which normally occurs, or\r\nb) the other party is not given
    the express right to prove that damage or reduction in value has not occurred
    or is materially lower than the lump sum agreed;\r\n6. (penalty)\r\na provision
    by which the user is entitled to receive payment of a penalty in the event of
    non-acceptance or late acceptance of performance, delay in payment or in the event
    that the other party withdraws from the contract;\r\n7. (exclusion of liability
    for death[ 4 ], injury to body and health and for gross fault)\r\na) (death and
    injury to body and health)\r\nexclusion or limitation of liability for losses
    arising out of death, injury to body or health caused by negligent breach of duty
    by the user or a deliberate or negligent breach of duty by his statutory agent
    or a person employed by him to perform the contract;\r\nb) (gross fault)\r\nexclusion
    or limitation of liability for other losses caused by a grossly negligent breach
    of duty by the user or a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty by a statutory
    agent of the user or by a person employed by him to perform the contract; \r\na)
    and b) above do not apply to restrictions of liability in the terms of transport,
    authorised in accordance with the Passenger Transport Act, of trams, trolley buses
    and motor vehicles in scheduled services, in so far as they do not derogate, to
    the detriment of passengers, from the Regulation concerning the terms of transport
    by tram and trolley bus and by motor vehicles in scheduled services of 27 February
    1970; b) above does not apply to restrictions of liability for State-approved
    lottery or raffle contracts.\r\n8. (other exclusions of liability in the event
    of breach of duty)\r\na) (exclusion of the right to withdraw from the contract)\r\na
    provision which, upon a breach of duty for which the user is responsible and which
    does not consist in a defect of the thing sold or the work, excludes or restricts
    the other party's right to withdraw from the contract; this does not apply to
    the terms of contract and tariff rules referred to in No. 7 on the conditions
    set out therein;\r\nb) (defects)\r\na provision by which, in contracts for the
    supply of new, manufactured things or of work,\r\naa) (exclusion and reference
    of claims to third parties)\r\nclaims against the user on account of a defect
    as a whole or with regard to individual elements of it are excluded entirely,
    restricted to the assignment of claims against third parties, or which make the
    pursuit of legal proceedings against third parties a condition precedent;\r\nbb)
    (restriction to supplementary performance)\r\nclaims against the user are restricted,
    entirely or with regard to individual elements, to a right to supplementary performance,
    unless the other party is given an express right to claim a price reduction if
    supplementary performance is unsuccessful or, except where the defects liability
    is in respect of building work, to choose to terminate the contract ;\r\ncc) (expenditure
    incurred in the course of supplementary performance)\r\nthe user's obligation
    to bear the expenditure necessary for supplementary performance, in particular
    the costs of carriage, transport, labour and materials, is excluded or restricted;
    \r\ndd) (withholding of supplementary performance)\r\nthe user makes supplementary
    performance conditional on the prior payment of the entire price or, having regard
    to the defect, an unreasonably high proportion thereof;\r\nee) (time-limit for
    notice of defects)\r\nthe user fixes a period within which the other party must
    give notice of non-obvious defects which is shorter than the period permitted
    under ff) below;\r\nff) (facilitation of limitation)\r\nfacilitates the limitation
    of claims on account of defects in the cases set out in \xA7 438 (1), No. 2 and
    \xA7 634a (1), No. 2, or, in other cases, results in a limitation period of less
    than one year from the date on which the statutory period of limitation begins;
    this does not apply to contracts in which the whole of Part B of the contracting
    rules for award of public works contracts is incorporated;\r\n9. (period of recurring
    obligations)\r\nin a contractual relationship concerning the periodic delivery
    of goods or the periodic supply of services or work by the user,\r\na) a contract
    duration which binds the other party for more than two years,\r\nb) a tacit extension
    of the contractual relationship which binds the other party for a period of more
    than one year in each particular case, or\r\nc) to the detriment of the other
    party, a period of notice to terminate the contract which is more than three months
    prior to the expiration of the initial or tacitly extended period of the contract;
    \r\nthis does not apply to contracts for the supply of things sold as a unit,
    to insurance contracts or contracts between the owners of copyrights and of claims
    and copyright collecting societies within the meaning of the Protection of Copyrights
    and Related Rights Act;\r\n10. (change of contract partner)\r\na provision whereby
    in sales contracts, contracts for the supply of services or contracts for work
    a third party assumes or may assume the rights and obligations of the user under
    the contract, unless the provision \r\na) specifies the third party by name, or\r\nb)
    gives the other party the right to withdraw from the contract;\r\n11. (liability
    of an agent on conclusion of the contract) \r\na provision by which the user imposes
    on an agent who concludes the contract for the other party,\r\na) the agent's
    own liability or duty to perform the contractual obligation without having made
    an express and separate declaration in that regard, or\r\nb) where the agent lacks
    authority, liability which exceeds that under \xA7 179;\r\n12. (burden of proof)\r\na
    provision by which the user alters the burden of proof to the detriment of the
    other party in particular by\r\na) imposing the burden in respect of circumstances
    which fall within the scope of the user's responsibility, or\r\nb) requiring the
    other party to acknowledge particular facts;\r\nSubsection b) above does not apply
    to acknowledgments of receipt which are separately signed or bear a separate,
    qualified electronic signature;\r\n13. (form of notices and declarations)\r\na
    provision by which notices or declarations to be given to the user or third parties
    are subject to a stricter requirement than the need for writing or to special
    requirements with regard to receipt.\r\n...\r\n\r\n"

    contract by intention: EULAs are not \"smuggled\" into a purchase as you suggested
    but are essential part of it. As you know, you don't \"buy\" fonts (just like
    you don't \"buy\" design work) but a license to use it. The license fee is determined
    by how extensive your use is. And the EULA is a standardized agreement for assumed
    standard cases.\r\nEven if some national laws nullify parts of the agreement,
    still the essense of \"purchasing\" a font is getting a license whose details
    are defined in the EULA. (Like, in Germany you do have some rights as a customer,
    whether the terms of sale mention them, don't mention them, or even say the opposite.)\r\nAnd
    that US copyright law outrightly disrespects type designers' work is still another
    story.\r\n\r\n<cite>And really, what\u2019s the misleading talk about acquiring

    good point.\r\nHowever, do you want to say: Because fonts are already stolen and
    distributed through other channels, those who license them are idiots? Please
    remember that there are also idiots who design them, and designing type can be

    of a deal, and may use whatever legal terms they want, yet the law may say something
    different. Recall my original microsoft example? Here's another, from a completely
    different field:\r\n\r\nA manufacturer supplies goods (say toys) to a retailer,
    but doesn't get paid for 60 days. What happens if the retailer goes bankrupt?
    The manufacturer loses the goods and becomes just another creditor (who gets little).
    So the manufacturer says: \"I am not selling you the goods, but retain them as
    my property and give them to you on consignment (that means that you sell them
    on my behalf and I pay you a commission; you never get title to the goods). If
    you go bankrupt, I reclaim my property.\"  Does this work? Maybe, depending on
    the law of the land. Do you see my point?\r\n\r\nAs for embedding, I meant that

    that embedding really doesn't cause the supplier any harm.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "> if you don\u2019t like people enforcing IP law\r\n\r\nIs this meant as
    a joke?\r\n\r\nIt should be stressed that the EULAs of American font companies
    do not enforce the laws of the United States. On the contrary, these US companies
    in fact **replace** the US laws by their own private \"company laws\".\r\n\r\nFor
    instance in the Adobe EULA we read:\r\n\r\n\"Adobe ... expressly disclaim all
    ... whether by statute, common law, ... or otherwise\".\r\n\r\nIn Europe, a state
    is defined as a \"law state\" (\"Rechtsstaat\" in Germany, \"\xE9tat de droit\"
    in France, etc.). The word \"law state\" does not seem to exist in the American
    language, since the USA is obviously not a law state (in the sense of \"Rechtsstaat\"
    or \"\xE9tat de droit\").\r\n\r\nIn a law state, it is not possible that companies
    replace the laws of the state by their \"own laws\" (\"company laws\", \"private
    laws\"). Since America is not a law state, Adobe can expressly replace the US
    laws (\"whether by statute, common law, ... or otherwise\") by its own private
    \"Adobe laws\", and in fact the Adobe EULA makes these \"law replacements\" to
    a large extent (with the consequence that the Adobe EULA is illegal and invalid
    in Europe).\r\n\r\nAs regards this situation, I made this cynical remark\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/fstype.bas\r\n(REM
    *** E.g. if bit 15 is set, this means that ....)\r\n"

    mean the person whose truck it fell off of violated the EULA by redistributing?
    \r\n\r\nOne common EULA feature that I have personally violated many, many times
    is right to pass fonts off to a printer. According to many EULAs, the prepress
    person is supposed to license the font also, particularly if they are working
    with native files. For lithographic printing, it is often necessary for the prepress
    person (which used to be me) to have the native InDesign or Quark files to set
    up the color separations. Designers typically can't do this themselves for a variety
    of reasons. In the shops where I worked, I don't think anyone seriously considered
    \ licensing the fonts again for my use. Also, not being a Typophile(TM) at the
    time, I don't think the licensing issues ever occured to me. \r\n\r\nAs composite
    digital printing becomes more common, documents will be submitted more as PDF
    files, which is more often allowed. "

    am a letterpress printer and the process tends to require that digital fonts need
