body: <!--break-->Does anyone know of any good fonts for resumes? I am going to write
  one soon and I would like it so that it looks neat and that it's something I personally
  enjoy looking at too. Preferably, the font should be free, but if not, I would like
  a more well-known and accessible font.

  body: On my resume I use Futura Bold Condensed and Futura Light Condensed. I think
    the two have a nice contrast with each other. Just make sure it's easy to read.

  body: "Choose a legible serif face with a hint of character that subtly conveys
    something about your personality. I don't really understand questions of this
    kind, because the question shouldn't be \"what's a good font for a resume?\" Any
    (readable, probably serif) font is good for a resume. The question is \"what font
    fits my personality and image?\" A resume is about subtly branding yourself, so
    choose something with a hint of you in it. I've recently designed some resumes
    for friends. I've used different typefaces for all of them. This reminds me a
    bit of the recent post on \"what's a good font for a novel?\" The only real answer
    to that is \"what's the novel about?\" So \u2014\r\n\r\n1. Of course the medium
    (resume, novel, etc.) determines to some extend what sorts of faces will work.
    You wouldn't set a novel entirely in Zapfino (usually), because the properties
    of a novel, such as type size and length of text, don't lend themselves to that
    font, and vice versa. In the case of resumes, the practical limitations are that
    it should be easily readable; have a professional, calm appearance, and have enough
    variants (or other faces) to serve the hierarchy. BUT \u2014\r\n\r\n2. The point
    of your design isn't to allude to the idea of a resume, and all the associations
    that entails, but to allude to yourself. You're not designing the medium, you're
    designing the message. So your question is really, What do I want my resume to
    say about me?"
