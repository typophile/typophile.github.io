  looking everywhere possible since. Some examples are listed below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example01_4714.png]\r\n-\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example02_4368.png]\r\n-\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example03_3818.png]\r\n\r\nI
  have stumbled across only one in the past day that is very close, but some of the
  serif/ornaments are not the same. That can be seen here.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2898\r\n\r\nI
  have literally spent hours going through free and paid type sites and am just not
  having any luck. The above was actually suggested using What the Font on MyFonts.com.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any input!"

    Girl and Lynchburg were melded into a much nicer font.\r\n\r\nNot sure these are
    100% it but it gives me a great starting point. Still gonna keep looking a bit
    more, any more suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks again riccard0."

  body: I wonder if it's a font that actually has some kind of inline detail which
    has been removed. It looks a little heavier than the similar ones that have been
    linked to here.
