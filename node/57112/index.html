"<cite>Vincent Connare designed the ubiquitous, bubbly Comic Sans typeface, but he sympathizes with the world-wide movement to ban it.</cite>"
<br>
Interesting.

Comic Sans fell victim to its "popularity". Probably Vincent Connare would design a Comic Sans revival in the future to counteract the Ban Comic Sans movement.

So true! I don't like it (although I confess I used it exclusively for one month when I was nine) but it's perfect for comics. If Comic Sans disappeared I would be very, very sad.

And everyone would have to find something new to talk about.</div>

<cite>...but it’s perfect for comics</cite>
A typeface was born for a reason and specific use. If it goes beyond where it's supposed to be applied, it will soon wear out its welcome, vim and vigor and typographic value, but it would not vanish. When it comes to a waning or outdated typeface, many people are ambivalent about the face with a love-and-hate relationship.

Perhaps this is an opportune time and place to remind everyone what sort of beast this is. It erects edifices on the internet and adorns them with bits and pieces discarded by others, usually solicited by trolling. It remains anonymous for obvious reasons, and pretends to be genuinely interested in the topics appropriate to the forum. Upon close inspection, its questions are leading, and its arguments are superficial. It has no interest in typography, fonts, layout, design, or humour.</div>

again, own your own behavior, don't blame it on me...

if you drag ad hominem crap into a silly thread like this,
then that's on _you_ -- jan schmoeger -- it's not on me.


>    It remains anonymous for obvious reasons

i'm not "anonymous".

i'm known worldwide as _bowerbird_intelligentleman_,
a restless reckless performance poet from los angeles,
and have been in cyberspace with that name since 1996,
maintaining the same e-mail address for that whole time.
(it's bowerbird at aol dot com, if you want to correspond.
and if you wanna talk on the phone, e-mail your number,
and i will call you so you can learn my phone number too.)

and i've done research, observation, and programming on
electronic-books since 1986, so if i am "pretending" to be
"genuinely interested" in it, i am doing a damn fine job of it.

oh yeah, and i like comic sans because it's cute and cuddly,
which is the same reason its critics dislike it, so we all agree.       :+)

so, jan, why do you feel you need to be in attack mode?
did somebody hurt you when you were a child, maybe?

or perhaps while you were growing up there in australia,
a real-life bowerbird bit you on the butt?  tell us, jan...

I whole-heartedly endorse this. How about Comic Sans Next? CS2100? Comic X? It would be great to have contextual alternates, ending/beginning figures, etc., but just making it look a bit more natural and not so smooth would be great. </div>

I say this is impossible, not to endorse, but to achieve, unless some other underemployed and thus free-to-act MS employee takes it up. Don't ever forget — CS looks like it should be free because essentially it was.

This is true, but if any type designers want to take a stab at creating new designs using the Comic Sans name they should make a pitch to the folks at Ascender Corp. I would imagine these designs would prove popular on their www.fontmarketplace.com site - $4.99 is pretty close to free

What we really need is a full optical range/weight/width family with oldstyle/lining figures and petite and regular small caps. (Interestingly, it already has a Eastern European coverage and Greek support, so you have to give it props for that...)

That would make Comic Sans more useable, if you ask Linotype. Comic Sans Next. Designed by Akira Kobayashi and Vince Connarre.</div>

then you're a chickenshit, with zero integrity.

it's _not_ "polite" to be nasty when someone is absent,
but nice when they are present.  it's just hypocritical...

now, i didn't know vince would be visiting here either,
or i would have said that one of the best things about
comic sans is the capital-i, which distinguishes itself
from a lowercase-l, unlike too many sans-serif fonts.
(verdana is one other good exception in this regard.)

anyway, vince, thanks for following up on that hunch,
and for spending that "one week" of time doing it, and
for being a good sport about reactions to your creation.

Yeah, but even successful founders like us, who make fonts people actually come in for, can't afford to pay users almost 5 bucks to take the fonts like this, no way. Don't ever forget, MS had to publish this font, or loose tens of 1,000s of dollars, while we have options.

		<div class="commentbody">I remember the music paper 'Boston Rocks'! nothing is banned in Boston but taxes on tea and the New York Wankees.

This is from a teacher in California sent to me about ban comics sans.

This is a travesty! I feel the need to set the record straight on the importance of Comic Sans, in both the school setting and in society, in facilitating a kinder gentler world!

People over eat, yet no one is attempting ban food! It's not the food's fault if people miss-use it, nor is it Comic Sans fault! Besides, there are >much< bigger fish to fry such as mixing multiple font on the same page! Ack!

If I removed all the words that are in the comic sans font from my classroom, it would be completely devoid of words! Thank you for contibuting to a healthy loving and less intense environment for my students. ... Read more

I am a responsible user. When I send formal letters I use Tahoma or Arial, but never TNR - it's too depressing! And yes
believe it or not, my default font on my computer is set to comic sans. I've have far too much trauma in my life to deprive myself of a little comic relief!! </div>
