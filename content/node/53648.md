  is an audio book cover and not an actual book, I think this is a perfect example
  of type being used with an image.  I love how the main part of the title, \"Shooter\",
  is in the scope of a sniper rifle.  It relates perfectly to what the story is about
  instead of a random image that could be misleading like some covers out there.  Overall,
  I think it's just really cool and well put together.\r\n\r\nAfter I found the audio
  book, I decided to look online to see if there was also a regular book. Below are
  the images I found to go with it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060401-shooter_5576.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/354275_4102.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  think both images are good book covers, but I like the first one better. I find
  the \"big ball of sun\" to wash out the colors in the image of the second one."
