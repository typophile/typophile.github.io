  t-shirts that display American ideals. The designs will focus on the concepts of
  liberty and freedom (which is why I chose a torch). I wanted to keep the logo simple
  yet interesting. Let me know what you think of what I've done so far. Also, let
  me know if the typeface is a good one to use. I was thinking about using an older,
  American Revolution era typeface but this one was more bold and fresh. The other
  older font types didn't give of a powerful, inspiring feel. Be brutally honest;
  I want my logo to be the best it can be.\r\n\r\nTarget Market:\r\nLiberty loving

  body: "Funny, even before I saw the image I was going to suggest Brothers:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/\r\nAnd
    I think it would work even better than what you have.\r\n\r\nAs for the torch,
    it would be nice if it reflected the look of the font - like being only straight
    lines, and not having any pointy bits.\r\n\r\nBTW, another motif you can use (pretty
    trendy at the moment) is something that evokes Captain America's shield (although
    if you stay too close to it you'll hear from some lawyers I guess).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: Wow, I absolutely love that! It's a beautiful typeface that merges the two
      looks I am going for. I wish it wasn't $140 but thanks for the suggestion anyway.
      I'll definitely keep that one bookmarked.

    the Bold style is basically a caps-plus-smallcaps font - it doesn't have a lowercase.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I love that brothers font! I feel it may be too \"old\" looking. Definitely
    is more of a period typeface. However, I do feel it goes better with your current
    torch. I would redraw the torch, as per hrants suggestion, and make it match your
    current font, which I like as well. I DO get that \"Russian\" feel though. Just
    off the top of my head, maybe try something along the lines of http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection?
    Or perhaps something similar that is custom...? If you do keep your current font,
    you should rework the kerning a bit.\r\n\r\nOh just opened up MyFonts and saw
    this one: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ahmet-altun/regular/ the bold, all caps
    might work. I think the \"A\" is very Americana."
