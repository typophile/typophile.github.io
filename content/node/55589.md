  you find as being part of some typefaces : what's the name of that kind of characters
  ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sign_5952.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's also
  a most common variant, in horizontal sense, sometimes with a double line composing
  the figure.\r\n\r\nThis one is from the Hoefler & Frere-Jones's site.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much for any input."

    called 'hedera', the ivy leaf, which is used to separate paragraphs.\r\n\r\nBut,
    what about that kind of 'infinit' sign, whose function seems to be similar ? (I
    remember I've found it below a heading section, for example)"
