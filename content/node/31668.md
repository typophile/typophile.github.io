body: Because my school does not offer type design or lettering courses I am planning
  to work on it myself next year as an independent guided study for credit. As part
  of my planning for this, I am looking at existing courses at other schools. Would
  some of the type teachers and students out there please send me your syllabi? If
  you're able to help, please email the file to james dot puckett at gmail dot com.

  body: Oh, I was hoping to see it posted here! I've been out of school since 2001,
    but I'd be interested in doing something like that on my own!
