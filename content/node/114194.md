  the same font for other purposes.\r\nThe logo is not from me and I have no way to
  know who made  it...\r\n\r\nAll what I've got is a vectorial PDF file, which seemed
  to be exported from an Illustrator file. \r\n\r\nI have been able to extract the
  letters and classify them by upper & lower case as in the enclosed picture.\r\nPlease
  note that I had to rotate the letters (so the slight inclination of some letters
  has nothing to do with the font itself) and that there's may be no clue in the script
  as it most probably means nothing (\"CHENT maplindorst\")...\r\n\r\nWould someone
  know which font is this?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Well I thought it was only one font but actually
  two fonts had been mixed up! I could determine with two distincts on online tools
  that upper case are Friz Quadrata SB Regular and lower case Russel Square Std...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exfont_4292.png]"
