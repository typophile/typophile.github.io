    you noticed this about yourself?

  body: "The solution to modular fonts is simple: Don't make them modular. You can
    limit yourself to so many pieces, but still, for a good result, small changes,
    optical or not, always have to be made.\r\n\r\nOf course it's easier with a display
    type such as used here, but I agree that the smoothness is a bit lacking. \r\n\r\nReading
    text is simple because of repetition, but that doesn't mean you can't tweak repetition,
    this is what brings character to your type. Of course it's a very good way to
    start, with Fontstruct being a very nice stepping tool for a quick experiment
    before trying it out for real.\r\n\r\nThe thing I like about a modular typeface
    is the creative solutions (at least often enough) within the limited possibilities.
    Since they quite often play with the relations of the letters within the alphabet
    to each other instead of just being a copy of what (for instance) the basic latin
    alphabet is."

  body: "I believe, the trick to making a good modular font is making it immodular.
    During, or after you've assembled your segments, run tests & make notes. If something
    looks wrong or feels uncomfortable, it's wrong. Go back an tap those arrow keys
    until it feels right. Use the force. No measuring allowed. These small adjustments,
    will in turn make other glyphs look uncomfortable. Spacing should rarely be modular.
    For example, there's no formula for spacing an L or T. It's likely that the best
    sidebearings won't land on grid lines. Through repeated testing, note taking and
    arrow key bopping, your modular font will look balanced and it'll have less of
    that amateur font appearance everyone probably would prefer to avoid.\r\n"

  body: I mean, it's kind of obvious this article is for absolute beginners, no?  Sure
    it doesn't contain the very best methods and means and practices of a master type
    designer, but then, it's not supposed to.  I'm sure a few people who read this
    forum aren't masters yet.

    The least you can do is have a huge disclaimer to that effect. And don't call
    it \"stunning\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
