body: "Hello, I'm developing an app for type enthusiasts, on the Android platform.
  Perhaps it will be of use to artists, designers, or anyone who just loves type.\r\n\r\nAs
  of now, the user can: \r\n<li>display samples of all font files on the device ending
  in .ttf or .otf, with the exception of fonts located inside other application bundles.
  \ This does include the system fonts.\r\n<li>display the contents of the font file's
  \"name\" table (see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm or https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6name.html).
  This contains copyright, licensing, designer, manufacturer, and other information.\r\n<li>grow
  or shrink the sample text and apply bold, italic and underline styles to it. \r\n<li>apply
  custom background and text colors\r\n<li>download font files of interest into a
  local collection. A custom, integrated browser eliminates the need to use a file
  manager. Zip archives are handled transparently. A bookmark list is implemented
  and pre-loaded with a few font sites I know of.\r\n\r\nAt present the name of the
  app is not final, the features may change, and the artwork could use improvement.
  I'd be grateful for suggestions about what might be needed or just be cool to have,
  and feedback about what I have so far implemented.\r\n\r\nSome screen dumps are
  attached."
