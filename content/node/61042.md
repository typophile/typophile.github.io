  body: If you take the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype_library/frutiger_std_complete_vp/?&sample_text=television&sample_size=60">Frutiger
    Std 45 Light</a>, remove the dot on the i and cut the upper part of the t, that
    starts looking like the "television" of Sample 2. To me it seems the same font
    fits the bill for "CBC news".
