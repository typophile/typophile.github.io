  body: "Whoa! There is no one font that matches this, surely? It has two differing
    constructions for 'a' for a start, and two differing widths for the last two words.\r\n\r\nYou
    could start with something like <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/616/itcclearface-family.html\">Clearface</a>
    and mess about with it yourself. Another one that reflects the style of the period
    is <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90458/windsor-family.html\">Windsor.</a>\r\n\r\nAnd
    you could probably find something at http://www.letterheadfonts.com that comes
    closer to this than either of them, but I don't know what it would be called."

  body: You could check out the <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486999564.html">Dover
    Victorian fonts</a> cdrom &ndash; nothing quite matches this, but you might find
    something that creates a similar effect.
