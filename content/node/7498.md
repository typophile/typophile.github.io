  body: 'I finally decided to go and look for that book through boxes and dust &#40;hard
    decision, believe me&#41; but I think it&#39;s been worth it, didn&#39;t remember
    some interesting details. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.marionboyars.co.uk/Specific%20title%20pages/hitch.html"
    target=_top>Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho</a> by Stephen Rebello,
    Marion Boyars Publishers. <BR> <BR>From the chapter 2 - <i>The Novel <BR> <BR>...
    At Simon &amp; Schuster, the corridor talk pegged Psycho as a sensational read
    and a highly exploitable commodity. Art director Jeffery Metzner hired graphic
    artist Tony Palladino to design a title concept that would convey the shock aspect
    of the storyline. .... The illustrator recalled: &#34;The book and tittle were
    on the tongues of a lot of people at Simon &amp; Schuster at the time. That title
    was so descriptive, I let the tittle become the graphic. It was much stronger
    than any illustration one could do. The guy [in the novel] was quite cracked up,
    so, in the graphic, I cracked up the lettering to reinforce the tittle.&#34;</i>
    <BR> <BR>From the chapter 9 - <i>Publicity <BR> <BR>... First, Hitchcock concentrated
    not on the stars of the picture but on the title itself. Having taken a particular
    fancy to the title design for the book jacket by artist Tony Palladino, Hitchcock
    contacted the advertising agency, McCann-Erickson, to arrange a deal. &#34;[Hitchcock]
    called me one day,&#34; artist Palladino said, &#34;telling me it was a smashing
    design and that he thought it would be perfect for the ads for this film. He wanted
    the lettering to dominate the newspaper and poster advertising, with just a few
    photographs of the main actors. I found it exciting learning how absolutely pragmatic
    he was. He preplanned so carefully, he could skim off the fat. I really got the
    sense he respected creative accomplishment in others.&#34; Palladino received
    $5.000 for a complete buy-out of his concept, hardly a paltry sum when one considers
    that novelist Robert Bloch had received little more for the rights to the original
    book!</i> <BR> <BR>And not directly related with the Psycho logo but from the
    chapter 6 -  <i>Postproduction <BR> <BR>... Observed Adler&#42; of his experiences
    with Hitchcock on Psycho: &#34;We made it work. Oh, god, I would have hated it
    to work in the Hitchcock office. It was so strait-lace and formal when he was
    present. Mr. Hitchcock was the most articulate person I ever met. And he always
    had specific ideas of what he wanted. I was amazed to see that his library in
    his large office contained more art books and current magazines on graphics than
    I owned. He would specify specific new type styles that he had seen advertised
    in Graphis, a magazine mostly graphic artists would get.</i> <BR> <BR><i>&#42;...
    It was the task of Harold Adler, a movie advertising artist and title design letterer,
    to make the Bass concepts work on film.</i> &#40;For the movie titles&#41;. <BR>
