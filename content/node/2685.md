  body: You aren&#39;t the only one who&#39;s been looking for that &#39;font&#39;.  I
    saw numerous posts for it on alt.binaries.fonts, and someone else sent me a sample
    to ID a few days ago. Do you notice how the identical letters &#40;like E and
    A&#41; don&#39;t look the same each time they appear? That&#39;s the biggest clue
    that this is artwork. Another point is all the contour details on the letters
    themselves, with variable shading that you can&#39;t get from Photoshop or any
    other type-styling app I know. The last point is the completely outrageous &#39;baroque&#39;
    swashes would be nearly impossible to make work in a digital font, although I
    know many fonts have swash character sets.  These are beyond almost anything I
    can think of for complexity.

  body: You might also look at <a href="%20http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?83/23947"
    target="_blank">Escrita from T-26</a> or their wild font <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/bacchus/"
    target="_blank">Bacchus</a> which has one of the most flamboyant swashes. Also
    Scriptorium&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/john-speed/"
    target="_blank">John Speed</a> is beyond wild.

    border=0> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/platthand/"
    target="_blank"> Platthand</a>, also from Scriptorium, is waaay over the top  <BR>too.
    A little more restrained, but still quite swashy and  <BR>personal favourites
    of mine are IHOF&#39;s <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/dearestswash.html" target="_blank">
    Dearest</a> and  <BR>Psy/Ops&#39; <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_anglia.html"
    target="_blank"> Anglia</a>, though we&#39;re veering into different  <BR>territory
    now. <BR> <BR>And check this beauty by Miles Newlyn: <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMis.html"
    target="_blank"> Missionary</a>&#39;s  <BR>got little to do with actual swashes,
    but it&#39;s beautifully  <BR>intricate &#40;or is that intricately beautiful?&#41;
