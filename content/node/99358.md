  Sorry for that. Well, I'm trying to find out what kind of font is used in this logo.\r\n\r\nI've
  akready find out that the 'R' is written with the Dear Joe 4.\r\nbut the rest of
  the word Renaissance (enaissance) isn't written with the same font and I can't find
  what font is used.\r\n\r\nI also don't know what font is used to write the word
  \"num\xE9rique\".\r\n\r\nOf course, I used website like WhatTheFont or others but
  without result.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
