  am offering proper letterpress correspondence cards, printed using Intertype or
  Ludlow slugs, instead of the usual computer-generated photo-polymer.\r\n\r\nPrinted
  on super-thick 400gsm card, six styles are available (please ignore the slight variance
  between the digital fonts used for illustration and the real fonts named in the
  examples).\r\n\r\nI have access to possibly the largest collection of Ludlow and
  Intertype matrices in the UK, so if you don't like the six example styles, take
  a look at the huge on-line catalogue of available founts.\r\n\r\nThe price of \xA380
  per 100, with envelopes, includes proof and delivery.\r\n\r\nTake a look here: http://j.mp/1dk9Jcy\r\n\r\nDave
