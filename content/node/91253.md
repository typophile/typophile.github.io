  body: I managed to find a PDF of the work online and through Acrobat I can see that
    the face is called "Pralinette" though I think it may not be available for sale.

  body: "Hi eleanorrogers, \r\nI've been looking for the same typeface. Did you manage
    to find out anything more? It's almost impossible to search for a typeface with
    a name which is also a piece of food. I tried emailing Mathias Schweizer, but
    he did not write back. \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Galeries Lafayette commision many bespoke fonts, some of which they only
    use for a limited period of time. They also have proprietary versions of commercial
    fonts such as Ashby, named AshbyGL. Most of the work has been done by Mathias
    Schweizer.\r\n\r\nTheir unique fonts have included:\r\n\r\nStive - a childish
    hand-printing font\r\nLaGdProto - see image\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GaleriesLafayetteProto_4627.jpg]\r\nA
    few avant-garde/futura styles and others.\r\n\r\nNone that I know of have ever
    seen the light of day outside of GL itself.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
