body: "I need advice on OpenType coding for a font with stylistic alternatives.  This
  feature is mostly about adding extra high ornamental ascenders, and using longer
  descenders as well; but alternative forms of \u2018c\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018g\u2019,
  \u2018r\u2019, and the final form of \u2018s\u2019 with upper right flourishes are
  also included in the alternative set. The problem is that the flourished forms of
  these last must be suppressed whenever \u2018b\u2019, \u2018f\u2019, \u2018h\u2019,
  \u2018k\u2019, \u2018l\u2019, or \u2018longs\u2019 would follow them, and the ordinary
  forms without the flourish used instead. Would it be best to suppress the substitution
  of the flourished forms in these cases by adding \u2018ignore\u2019 commands to
  a block of \u2018salt\u2019 code, or to code this in some other way?  "

  body: Using 'ignore' is more elegant. Apple apps in OSX (10.5.8, curious if it's
    the same in more recent versions) however execute substitutions even in contexts
    forbidden by preceding 'ignore' statements ...
