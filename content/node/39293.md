  with the choice of font - it was originally specc'ed for the mag when it had the
  title of 'groundswell' and worked really well. The client loved it, however we were
  forced to change the title as there is already a mag out there with the name (Christian
  Surfers title).\r\n\r\nAnyhow the font is poorly rendered, so I have redrawn it
  and made some changes in response to peoples posts.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nLook
  forward to any thoughts?"

  body: "You might want to post a slightly smaller image, but with a uniform white
    margin running around it. Would make it easier to view.\r\n\r\nThe way you've
    done the 'A' bothers a bit. Somehow it seems horizontally flipped. I think the
    curving of the apex should be on the left-hand side. You're probably trying to
    mirror the lines of the 'R' on SURF, but it doesn't work too well. \r\n\r\nAlso
    the weight of the first 'A' does not match with that of the other characters in
    the word AUSTRALIA. Have you created it by scaling up the smaller 'A'? \r\n\r\nLikewise,
    the R also may look better if redrawn. Being a curved form, it typically should
    go a little over the cap-height so that it visually aligns with the more angular
    characters. \r\n\r\n"

  body: I see you have chosen a font in which the digraph 'LI" could be easily mistaken
    for a "U". It's probably not such a big deal should someone misread your logo
    as "SURF AUSTRAUA", but I recall a video rental store called "Great Flicks" had
    a sign using a similar font with disastrous results.
