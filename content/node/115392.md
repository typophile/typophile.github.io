  using Chaparral Pro Bold in a logo design for commercial purposes and I want to
  make sure that it's free to use, or that the company pays for it if it's not free.
  I'm pretty sure this font came installed on my mac, but a google search brought
  me to realize that Adobe is charging money for it. http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1717\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the best way to be 100% certain that a font you're using is free?\r\n\r\nI'm
  also wondering, say the company chooses not to pay for it ... who is liable for
  it's usage, the freelance designer or the company that uses it for commercial purposes?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, \r\n\r\nmegs\r\n\r\n"

    kind of free? I'm guessing free from legal hassles when used in logo design.\r\n\r\nMy
    understanding, thoroughly inexpert as it is, is that you can use Chaparral to
    design logos for others as long as 1) they do not need the font to use the logo
    or 2) they have their own licence."

  body: "Thanks guys.\r\n\r\nI understand that Chaparral Pro is bundled by Adobe and
    available via my creative cloud subscription, but does that mean I can use any
    of those fonts free of charge? \r\nAnd yes, by \"free\" I mean for commercial
    use (in a logo, for example).\r\n\r\nIn the grander scheme, I'm wondering if there
    is some standard way to find out if a font is legally free to use for commercial
    purposes. I would check the licensing info of the particular foundry, but I can't
    seem to find anything about Adobe font licensing. In that case should I assume
    it's not free to use in a commercial logo because Adobe is selling it? Or would
    you recommend contacting Adobe?\r\n\r\nmegs\r\n\r\n"

    is to find the end user agreement that came with it when it was licensed and read
    it carefully. \r\n\r\nConcerning Adobe originals, here is a link that may be useful:
