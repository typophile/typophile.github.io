  \ The original version from 1896, not any of the following versions.  About all
  I can seem to find is that it may have been derived from Didot or Walbaum, that
  it was based on typical German 'jobbing' alphabets of the time, and of course that
  it was released by Berthold in 1896.\r\n\r\nI would love to read a whole book about
  how this face came about and what went into it's design.  Perhaps there simply isn't
  any detailed info available?"

    and its history is not as easy and linear as it seems. Complex enough to write
    a whole book about it. I wouldn\u2019t say that it is derived from Didot or Walbaum
    \u2013 it shares the same proportions and form model, yes, but so do most of the
    antecedent sans-serifs."
