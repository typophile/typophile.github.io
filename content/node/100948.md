  the same typo on his website and on his logo.\r\nSo I use \"Coustard\" : http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Coustard\r\n\r\nBut
  when I vectorize it with illustrator, it's completly deformed... as you can see
  in attached file.\r\nI never saw it.\r\n\r\nDo you know a copy of coustard or an
  other solution to vectorize a typo ?\r\nDo you understand what's the problem ?\r\n\r\nThank
  for your support\r\n\r\nFanneau\r\n{link removed by moderator}"

    are distorting. Your best bet if you are in a hurry is to outline the words you
    need and fix the outlines.\r\n\r\nAs to why it is happening, I don't have an answer.
    The outlines look OK to me although the person that made the font got the vertical
    metrics settings wrong. Notify Google and ask them to fix it."

  body: "He mentions his employer in his signature; that is not intended as spam.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a serious problem if fonts don't outline correctly, but in the case of Coustard,
    it is much less of a problem, since that is a free font. Hence, one's service
    bureau can be given a copy. In the case of commercial fonts, to obey the license
    and have it printed, one has to turn the document into outlines so that the font
    need not be embedded or given to the service bureau doing the printer - and so
    a metrics bug like that in a commercial font turns the licensing into a fatal
    obstacle to printing documents."

  body: "Blimey! Caught leaving a url signature on typofight.\r\n\r\nLike all fonts
    auto-instructed by an early version of ttfautohint, the outlines get hosed when
    being turned into outlines in certain OSX Adobe apps. Same would happen to output
    with the instructed TTF's via certain postscript printer drivers. Wasn't a feature
    to restrict non-web use (nice idea tho!), but a bug. Got fixed, but there's still
    a few fonts that have slipped the net. Coustard was 're-hinted' some time ago,
    but maybe not yet updated on certain font servers. Updated version available from
    vernnobile on github. Won't leave a url, just in case :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
