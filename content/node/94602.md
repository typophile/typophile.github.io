    part is Interstate, too, but stretched for whatever reason."

  body: I saw that early, the logo is clearly Interstate. I wish there was a larger
    view of the brochure, it looks like Interstate light but I cant see the a's which
    look a little different. Maybe the the size/resolution of the image is distorting
    it.
