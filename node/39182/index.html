<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi guys!
I've actually already got an identity ( http://www.typophile.com/node/27464 )
but I'm not happy with the name "bloobseven" since a lot of people and clients ask me what it stands for.. and it doesn't really stand for anything but is rather a "back-in-the-day-.com-hype" name.
So I've decided to make it more personal and switch to my name "michael nagy" I've already sketched a few ideas [img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4861.png] and after a lil bit of doodling I came up with this idea [img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_6147.png]
The M,N and G form the pencil. MN stands for my name "Michael Nagy" and the G stands for "Grafiker" which is german for graphic designer.
However. In the cleaned up versions a lot of people read ECO insted of mng. Any ideas on how to make it more legible?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6216.png]
The font for the name is Myriad Pro. Is this a good solution in your opinion? I like Myriad cause it's versatile and not overused but I'd gladly take any typo suggestions into consideration.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think the reason people are seeing "ECO" is that the letters are stacked vertically. I'd try something horizontal instead.
As for Myriad, I see it used everywhere, simply because it's the default typeface in Photoshop and Illustrator. It still looks nice though. You might want to either go with a typeface closer to the letters you've drawn in the pencil shape, or make the letters in the pencil look closer to the typeface used for your name.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>It looks lke ECO also because of the angle. Maybe you should straighten it
In fact symbol/logotype relation is a little awkward. They don't seem to share the same language. If that's your symbol, you should probably try something like Neo Sans for the name.
But isn't a pencil a rather too obvious solution anyway? I much rather preferred the initial typographic options. The last two of the first set looked quite stylish.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think a nice type treatment would be better, too. Don't want to hit your audience over the head with the idea that you're a graphic designer; they'll get that with "grafiker".
Just thought you might want to see [[http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/19487|this]], too.

<div class=commentbody>hmm shit.. can't use that then.
Back to the drawing board then.. The only problem I've got with a typo only logo is that it might look too simple leading the potential client to saying "why should I hire him if a typo logo is all he could come up with"
you know what I mean?</div>

<div class=commentbody>"why should I hire him if a typo logo is all he could come up with..."
Not really. Most successful design and identity firms have extremely simple, usually typographic, logos. You make your statement by the refinement you bring to that simplicity - fine typography, exquisite spaces, restrained use of colours...
In fact a sort of neutrality in your own identity is often a good thing. You're saying you don't have a particular style, you can design whatever your client's brief requires you to.

<div class=commentbody>Well, I went back to the drawing board and came up with these 5 ideas/sketches.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mn5_4717.jpg]
a and b. Just some typo explorations using Neo Sans
c) the initials of my name in my own handwriting
d) my full name in my handwriting
e) (my personal favourite) while playing with a paper clip I found a way to combine the M and N in a nice way. I'm not sure about the font though. I'll gladly take any type suggestions into consideration.

<div class=commentbody>I would only keep c & e ... the rest are not as elegant as those two.
For c, I like your handwriting, and it has a nice energy to it. What do you think of the balance between the initials and the text? I'm wondering if the space between the 'n' initial and "Nagy" could be negotiated a little better.
For e, I immediately thought "a bent paperclip," which is really neat. The paperclip is a good concept to work off of, because it's such a banal object, yet at the same time you would really notice if it were not designed well!</div>

I like that and the Franklin Gothic one. Also because those two have a nice hierarchy of weights. In fact with the Neo Sans option I wish the difference in weight was even more pronounced i.e. use Bold or at least Medium for the name, as against Regular(?) now.

@all: I agree with the discrepancy between the weights. I've changed it now to Medium and Light.
@wd: I can't get that ligature to work and as far as I've read the NeoSans info .pdf
it doesn't have one for "fi"

You may need to finetune that terminal. Also perhaps slightly increase the gap where it bends back and approaches the diagonal:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mn7_3742_6169.jpg]

"as far as I’ve read the NeoSans info .pdf it doesn’t have one for “fi”"

IMO, you should make the circle a flat, even black, so that you don't run into problems reproducing the logo in situations where you are limited to printing in just one color.</div>
