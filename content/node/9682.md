  why does the forum always erase my post the first time?  And why doesn&#39;t it
  recognize PNGs?

    to use the Cartier caps for your index letters. How <i>

  body: dates would help. You can surf out the info for any stamp on ArchiviaNet from
    Canada Post <BR><a href="http://www.archives.ca/02/02011703_e.html" target="_blank">http://www.archives.ca/02/02011703_e.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Alot say lettering engraved by Donald J. Mitchell, then I guess he died
    and Yves Baril took over. I&#39;m thinking - they are stamps after all any element
    of them belongs to the crown, the image or illustration often outsourced but it
    seems everything else was internal. <BR> <BR>sometimes a typographer is mentioned
    but only by designer not font i.e. &#34;Typographed by Paul Arthur&#34; <BR> <BR>hope
    that helps. <BR> <BR>

  body: No luck at T.26 for the space font, and I still can&#39;t remember the name
    of that Far West font. I can do supplementary research after work, which is in
    6 hours or so. Sorry to keep you waiting. :/

    target="_blank"> PL Davison Americana</a>, which I momentarily confused with <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/thunderbird/" target="_blank"> Thunderbird</a>,
    hence the incorrect Bitstream assumption in my original reply. Still no luck with
    the NOMAD.
