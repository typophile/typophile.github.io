  this side of the type design scene but I'm considering establish a foundry. I can
  get my hands on some good capital but the issue of a skill base is the most pressing.
  I myself am not skilled enough to take designs from type and graphic designers in
  half or almost finished states and turn them into desirable commercial typefaces.
  I am however, confident in my business capabilities as well as my ability to curate
  the collection wisely. I have never worked at a type foundry but I am a budding
  type designer and my background is in graphic design.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any
  advice for me about aspects to keep an eye out for or put heavy consideration into?
  I would not be planning that this consume 100% of my time because I still want to
  design type and be a graphic designer but I can dedicate a good amount of time to
  the initial rollout and sustaining the company.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDave"

    \u201CKitchen Nightmares\u201D where someone, successful in another field, or
    blessed with an inheritance or rich parents, decides to open a restaurant, despite
    having no experience in the trade. As you can imagine it all goes horribly wrong
    \u2013 and it\u2019s not just the food that ends up getting burnt. \r\n\r\nPutting
    this image aside for a bit, my other thought is what\u2019s your value proposition?
    What can you offer that established, proven foundries can\u2019t? What will convince
    type designers to throw their hat in with your new company? Perhaps it\u2019s
    as simple as offering large advances on royalties? \r\n"

  body: "Sii, thanks for your comments. I admit I am at the beginning of considering
    all of this but I'm sorry if you have the impression I'm incapable of making this
    work or that I would be as unopen and unresponsive to critique and advice as the
    people on that show. I am relatively successful in a closely related field and
    I am not receiving hand outs so I would have to work hard.\r\n\r\nWhat I would
    be offering is an collective Australian voice, I have some material lined up and
    some designers ready to participate. I think Australian type design needs a representative
    as none currently (of any great virtue) currently exist. Large advances in royalties
    may lure designers but I'm unable to tell if this would be possible financial,
    or would in fact be sensible.\r\n\r\nMk2, it would definitely be a collective,
    I currently have no type designs worth licensing. I don't know what my plan is
    as yet, nor do I know whether I really want to proceed and put in all the effort
    this is going to take to make successful.\r\n\r\n"

    up this kind of outfit. An Australian collective would be unique and have the
    potential to improve the situation in our country.\r\n\r\nAs an Australian type
    designer I am underrepresented. I support your idea in theory. In practice I make
    mainly strange, unconventional, original types not based closely on existing type
    designs, and these kinds of faces don't sell in appreciable numbers. I'd gladly
    offer them to you for your collective, but would it be worth your while trying
    to market them? Somehow I don't think so. Plus I have my own highly-developed
    indie type house marketing, brand / branding and branding communications strategy
    already worked out.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side I have started making commercial
    text and display fonts which need better marketing / distribution. If that material
    would be of interest you may certainly contact me offline.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    you are a large vendor like Fonts.com, Myfonts, Ascender Corp or Veer, with sizable
    collections of trendy commercial fonts from numerous sources. Some font buyers
    grumble about the price of retail fonts, but in reality vendors sell them at an
    absurdly low price and still have trouble turning in the kind of sizable revenue
    required to sustain a going business. Small vendors usually are not successful
    and rapidly go out of business.\r\n\r\nThe real money in type design is in commissioned

    (Australia)\r\n\r\nI apologize and try not to offend any Australian designers
    here, but where I am in Canada I don't see much Australian influence (which is
    a problem that needs to be corrected!)\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of offering the
    default types, you started a small foundry, with a big heart.  What if instead
    of trying to sell global fonts to an australian market, you sold Australian fonts
    to a global market?\r\n\r\nIf you could somehow distill what it means to be Australian,
    what it means to have Australian layout, or Australian type, and market that image,

    of money to start a foundry, just time. For $20 a month or so, you can host a
    site that will allow more traffic than you will ever get. Maybe a few hundred
    or thousand dollars extra for ads here and there, but I don't think you need the
    level of capital that would require getting investors or bank loans or anything
    (and good luck making that happen for the next year or two!) \r\n\r\nIf your typefaces
    are really good, there's plenty of small foundry pools out there like vllg.com
    and Type Trust that might publish your fonts, and they give full credit to your
    foundry. Even \"big time\" places like Veer give complete credit to the designer
    and/or foundry. Once you get a few type designs published, you could think more
    about developing your own foundry into a go-to shop. But when you have only a
    few fonts under your belt it would make more sense to me to put them out there
    on established sites as your primary point of sales. You might take a look at
    Underware.nl as a case study, they only have a few fonts for sale, but each one
    is really unique and has an incredible level of thought and skill apparent in
    its design. They sell their fonts on other sites, too.\r\n\r\nHope that helps,
    I would like to start a foundry myself, too, but I plan on taking it slow. If
    you want something that's quickly profitable, typeface design is not the route
    to go -- not as difficult as saying \"I'm going to be a rock star\" with no musical
    training and never being in a band or performing in front of an audience, but
    it's close."

    your payment gateway or your merchant services fees?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning,
    it is certainly possible to sell typefaces using very little cash, particularly
    if you are using a service like PayPal to process your transactions. Because the
    service handles just about every part of the transaction, then things like a merchant
    account, payment gateway or SSL certificate are unnecessary. The processor takes
    care of that for you. Money that might be spent on those items comes directly
    out of your sales in the form of a percent to the payment processor. And, if you
    know how to wrangle a little code, you can easily set up a shopping cart yourself.
    \r\n\r\nThis can be a great way to start (and is in fact how we started) so you
    have very little cash investment up front. The only time you pay for services
    related to taking in money is when, in fact, you take in money.\r\n\r\nNot so
    funny now, eh?"

    as overhead on your product, or as part of web hosting. My point, though, was
    that you don't need to raise capital or take out a loan to start a type foundry.\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    I state outright that I don't run a foundry, but would like to someday. I feel
    like I've paid enough attention to the different business models out there, though,
    that I more or less have an idea about how I would approach it, and phattexta
