  I love redoing my personal logo, especially because I'm just a student designer
  and my \"personal\" brand is still being built upon. My initials are D, L, and S,
  and I've always had a problem piecing them together based on the shapes and high
  x-height of the L in comparison to the bowls of the D and S. Recently, I've been
  very interested in geometric monograms and especially how the specific letters--triangles
  for D's and L's, and a swirl for the S--could overlap to become my personal logo
  and being slightly legible while really deriving from the letters as opposed to
  clearly showing them.\r\n\r\nThese are the product of a late-night brainstorming
  process. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Logo 1.png\"

    but, to my eye, neither one makes DLS very clear.\r\n\r\nIf you are selling your
    creative skills, don't sweat it. If you are trying to promote yourself as a creative
    communicator, you probably ought to pursue a less visually ambiguous approach.
    Sometimes, less is actually more.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, for what it's worth."

  body: "Thank you for the feedback! And hrant, it looks like it now that you've said
    it, haha!\r\n\r\nAfter a hundred more iterations, I found another way to communicate
    my initials and sort of develop and interesting, ambiguous monogram (in a way).
    \ This logo is one that I really liked after many attempts at changing the length
    of the lines and the way they intersected; it seemed like this one was the most
    visually interesting. Any ideas about it? Edits? Comments? But sometimes the just
    black was making me board--or maybe it's just because I've been looking at it
    for so long. I'm curious as to how I should present it, so I've tried pretty quickly
    a few different ways and would love to hear your thoughts on the logo itself and
    the treatment of it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Treatments_5205.png\"

  body: "I like it. I'm also seeing the nice degree of ambiguity you say you want.\r\n\r\nTwo
    things:\r\n- The top right seems too long. You might consider gently deviating
    from your \"lattice grid\" to reduce (if not eliminate) that effect, although
    you'll have to mind the gaps so they all look equally thin.\r\n- Speaking of the
    gaps, you'll need a different version of this -with thicker gaps- for small/lo-res
    instances.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I was thinking to fudge the grid and end up somewhere between 6 and what
    you show above. Which might involve more than simply making the \"L\" area longer/shorter.
    It might even involve rotating the whole thing slightly... The grid after all
    is a tool, not a goal!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    your favorite, or do you think I need to push past just making the L area shorter,
