  I designed for a work of fiction I am creating. The alphabet, tenatively titled
  \"Deca,\" is numeral based; meaning that there is one \"letter\"corresponding to
  each number 0-9. Attached is the layout.\r\n\r\nI need a font version of this alphabet
  so that I can insert the characters into the graphic novel I am creating; the font
  only needs these characters replacing the numerals, no accompanying custom letters
  necessary. If anyone is interested in helping me do this I'd be grateful. I can
  provide vector files for the characters.\r\n\r\nThank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deca_5138.jpg]"

    echo the corresponding number, fx."

    on, 9 has 3 more angles than 6? and 0 has no angles because is the only one they
    draw using curves instead of segments? and they choose their preferred way to
    write 1 and 7, for example)\r\n"

  body: "@riccard0 - Thanks so much, that was quite speedy!\r\n\r\n@frode - my intent
    was to create a highly condensed set of characters that would be very quicky distinguishable
    when compacted into a block or string; it is used as the basis for coding a digital
    world that overlays physical reality, a sort of protege to the internet in the
    world i am creating. In essence it is less related to the linguistic alphabet
    than it is to binary code.\r\nThe shapes were more an aesthetic choice, however
    that is an interesting point about the geometric logic; I hadnt run into that
    theory regarding arabic numerals before."

    what i needed. One small thing: it seems that the \"0\" character offsets for
    some reason. Is the kerning off? (im definitely not a font-smith so i wouldn't
    know)"

    app and OS are you using? Fontstruct\u2019s font creation engine is a bit, shall
    we say, rough. Maybe it needs certain glyphs in the font to work properly. Could
    you download any other font from it to see if the zero behaves the same way?\r\nI
    can also make the font \u201Cclonable\u201D, so you can fiddle with it yourself.\r\n"
