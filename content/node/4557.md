  body: I agree, a bit to the left and perhaps a bit smaller, too.

  body: Is that Mrs Eaves?  <BR> <BR>&#39;bird&#39; looks a bit loose relative to
    &#39;Lady&#39;, particularly spacing around the i. I agree, align the center of
    the bug&#39;s body with the vertical axis of the i.

  body: <blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>Gap on capital L<!-/quote-!><hr
    size=0></blockquote> <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <i>too</i> bad, but shortening
    the leg on the L by about 15% would help.

  body: Apologies for the delay in my response <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your comments
    which I have found very helpful and - as expected - completely right! <BR> <BR>I
    have moved the bug to the left a bit and made it slightly smaller, tightened up
    the spacing on &#34;bird&#34; and shortened the leg on the L &#40;which was bothering
    me a lot too&#41;. <BR> <BR>See the new version below... <BR> <BR>The font is
    indeed Mrs Eaves &#40;I love it!&#41; but I took the &#34;y&#34; from the &#34;py&#34;
    ligature as it seemed to work better with the word &#34;landscapes&#34; underneath.
    <BR> <BR>If you have anymore comments I would love to hear them - good or bad.
    Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34986.jpg"

  body: Looks good, Steve. I thought that might be an alternate Y, but I don&#39;t
    own Mrs Eaves so I don&#39;t use it every day. <BR> <BR>One quick fix

  body: Steve, are your clients going to use this logo on a van? If so add a bit of
    a drop shadow to the ladybug for an effect. It wouldn&#39;t read at small sizes
    but on a van or poster it could.
