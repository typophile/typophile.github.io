body: I admire the typography used by Tate Gallery, London. They use it for signage
  inside the museums, on the web, and other places. It kind of resembles VAG and Helvetica
  Rounded. Maybe it&#39;s a custom face made by Wolf Olins, who created the identity
  for Tate Gallery. Can anyone clarify? <BR> <BR>You can have a close &#40;but brief&#41;
  look at it by typing <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/default.htm"

  body: ' This is genius. Not merely from a typeface  <BR>perspective, but from a
    corporate identity  <BR>perspective as well. <BR> <BR>Typical corporate identity
    systsems strongly  <BR>caution against variation. You could even argue  <BR>that
    too much variety dilutes a cohesive  <BR>identity. But in this case you could
    see how  <BR>variety would only strengthen the whole. <BR> <BR>Imagine you&#39;re
    an in-house designer at the Tate.  <BR>Instead of being handed a system that you
    could  <BR>potentially get very tired of, you&#39;re inspired by  <BR>its a huge
    array of possibilities. Brilliant. <BR> <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Handling a corporate design system is pretty much a matter getting other
    people to follow the rules for application. I guess the flexible Tate trademark
    does not have a guarantee against becoming uninspiring after some months or years.
    But I like Wolff Olin&#39;s way of rethinking what a trademark can be. <BR> <BR>Soren

    so now I'm sure, I love the G and the lightness and legibility and caracter of
