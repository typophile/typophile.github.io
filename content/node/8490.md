body: is there a way to get the glyphs without unicode extensions from reordering
  when you want FontLab to sort by unicode? i mean i want all the glyphs with unicod
  assignments in order first and then for the order of the rest to be left alone.
  can i make that happen?

  body: oh yes, i actually did the &#34;reply post&#34; right after i got Adam&#39;s
    first message and then came and saw that he had added that it&#39;s fixed in FL5,
    that&#39;s when i posted my &#34;loverly&#34; post and didn&#39;t stick around
    to trash the previous post. i guess i wont try email reply any more.
