  a web design business and my current logo can be seen here: [[http://www.designbits.de]]\r\n\r\nI
  am not happy with it however, and this is the new idea I just came up with:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/designbits_6465.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  concept isn't radically new, I know, but it fits the purpose very well IMHO.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback..."

  body: "I like your present logo a lot more then this new idea...\r\n\r\nBut, if
    you are planning to use this, I would make the type about 20% smaller. I would
    also experiment with other typefaces. Perhaps something more mechanical/square
    to match the mark, or if your going for friendly, try lowercase and aligning the
    type to the bottom of the square.\r\n\r\nJeo."
