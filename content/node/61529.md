body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThats very good to finally found the guys who is suppling Georgian
  fonts to apple. The problem is, those fonts are so so ugly and very useless. We
  all Georgian mac users deleting two fonts: Arial Uni and this new one Menlo because
  almost 10 years we using our own very nice and very beautiful fonts from Mr. Reno
  Siradze. He is a professional and working on macs almost 25 year.\r\n\r\nWe are
  almost 100 mac users and have our georgian mac community and if you all believe
  me, we are using fonts from Reno Siradze and many years asking apple to builtin
  georgian fonts in the Mac OS X but nobody cares or even listens.\r\n\r\nPlease people
  if you have any power or ways to contact apple, ask them favour from georgian mac
  users to change fonts. The best fonts with georgian keybord drive are there: http://forum.ge/?f=98&showtopic=33965267
  screenshot also can find in this link.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nDavid"
