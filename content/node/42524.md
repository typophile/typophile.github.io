  body: For me they are useless because they don't have the 'Esperanto-letters' (c^,
    g^, h^, j^, s^ and u with breve)... :-(

  body: 'Your best bet is the Adobe OpenType Times Ten LT Std, where you can switch
    globally to old style figures (in Quark 7), plus the extra character glyphs usual
    with OpenType. Do not get their Times LT Std or Times New Roman MT Std bundles;
    they don''t have OSFs. The Times Ten is also, for my eyes, the biggest, crispest,
    and most legible Times on the market. Check the glyph coverage at the Adobe type
    website. '

  body: Also look for Monotype's Times New Roman PS in OTF format. It's the pre-Microsoft
    version of Times New Roman, and has the opentype features like small caps and
    oldstyle figures.
