  you guys recognise any of the remaining ones before I start searching in earnest.\r\n\r\nI
  think I should know the Inline serif face for The First Post, yet I am drawing a
  blank. The stencil face for The Cross Hands looks like it\u2019s based on Bodoni,
  but it\u2019s not any of the Bodoni Stencils I know. The Bodoni for The King\u2019s
  Head has this little protrusion on the \u201CG\u201D that throws me off.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the assistance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/worlds_end_typography_6594.jpg]"
