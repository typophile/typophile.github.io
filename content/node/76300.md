  Roman being one of them. After printing a load of Latin body copy (in bold) at 10pt
  i realised the i's all looked a bit off. On closer inspection i saw they were way
  too light to be bold - and in fact they were too light even for the regular weight
  of the other characters.\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/_GBsV026hma4/TN8TUu4SuTI/AAAAAAAAAZA/Gv8SRR5w9eQ/s1600/dustismo%2Broman.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  is a link to a cropped screenshot to give you an idea of what i mean, but you can
  see the same thing in the following link to Dustismo on DaFont (look at the 'I'
  in 'bold' example).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/dustismo-roman.font\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if this is an error with the way the characters were named and filed
  when the font was created? Or if it was actually a deliberate mistake? I quite liked
  it before i noticed this, but i guess i can't use it now.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nEddie"

  body: Most likely, the bold weight was created using either an Expand Stroke or
    Make Parallel Paths command, and the font author inadvertently deleted the exterior
    path, rather than the interior one.
