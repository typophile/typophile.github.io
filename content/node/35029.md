  for my other place in Amsterdam. Construction of the cabinets is finished, painting
  them as well. Next phase: getting the tops (they are being done by a stonemason)
  and installing it. Probably after the summer vacation, on account of floor insulation
  that will be done somewhere in the second half of August.\r\n\r\nWorking with your
  hands makes a nice change from sitting in front of a computerscreen. : )"

  body: Thats great! There's nothing like a good home renovation to make you feel
    more positive. My boyfriend and I just finished our home office. It's sunshine
    yellow, and all the furnature and storage is either white, or cardboard.
