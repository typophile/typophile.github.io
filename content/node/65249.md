body: "Here are some basic rules to improve your typography across either web or print.
  Of course, these rules are only to start with, and rules are meant to be broken.
  But if you want something to look neat, clean and generally well designed they are
  a good set to follow.\r\n\r\n1. Don\u2019t use too many type faces\r\nConsistency
  throughout a document or website is helpful. It brings unity and one identity. It
  also makes it clean, tidy and jus basically not messy. A good rule to follow then
  is to not use more than 3 different fonts in any one document.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6415.jpg]\r\n\r\n2.
  Hierarchy\r\nIt is always important in typography to pay close attention to the
  hierarchy of the page. The most basic thing is to keep the headline at the top of
  the page in a larger font. But more than this its just a case of looking at the
  page and asking other people what they read first. As a designer we should be thinking
  about communication constantly. This is our primary focus.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/head_5767.jpg]\r\n\r\n3.
  Type size\r\nUse no more than 4 text sizes in a document or website. Preferably
  3. Again this is a case of consistency. Too many copy sizes make a document disjointed.
  3 also allows enough variation to emphasise certain text and categorise text together.
  For example, you have one size for a heading, one for an introduction, one for body
  text and one for a pullout quote or something else. This will be consistent across
  the whole\r\n\r\n4. 8-12pt for body copy\r\nAlways keep body point between between
  these sizes. It looks neat and tidy and allows headings. Definitely do not go over
  12pt.\r\n\r\n5. A typeface not legible is not a typeface\r\nThere is a place for
  all kinds of artistic fonts, but for good standard copy lets keep things simple
  people. It must be legible. This is certainly the case for body copy. Keep experimental
  fonts for posters or at best headlines. They are never well received in large quantities.
  Can you read this easily?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leg_5441.jpg]\r\n\r\n6.
  Leading\r\nLeading is essentially the vertical space between the text lines. Leading
  is something that so many designers forget about, its easy just to stick with the
  auto settings. But trust me, this can make or break a document. Pay close attention
  to your kerning. I personally like to keep my kerning tight, but without ever overlapping.
  Usually I will go for a little above the font size, slightly below the auto setting.
  This works especially well with helvetica like fonts. Either way, there should not
  be too much space, and the fonts should not overlap at all!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leading_4003.jpg]\r\n\r\n7.
  Kerning\r\nKerning is the spacing between letters. Again, like leading this seems
  like an obvious one, but still needs careful attention. Consider if your font generally
  needs spacing out more, or if it looks better with tighter kerning. I always prefer
  helvetica and futura manually tightened as they have quite a bit of space between
  letters on the normal setting. Also it is worth taking special care with specific
  characters. Again, no characters should overlap. An example of this is for helvetica
  r and t characters together. Be worth kerning manually in this case.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning_4527.jpg]\r\n\r\n8.
  Accent or emphasise\r\n\r\nThis can help bring out key words and also break up large
  sections of text. Large chunks of copy tend to be quite scary, and idealy people
  like to skim. A subtle emphasis can bring out key words. A different colour, slightly
  darker perhaps or a slightly bolder version of the font are nice techniques.\r\n\r\n9.
  Do not over emphasise\r\nEmphasis in a body of text should be kept simple and elegant.
  I either use bold, italic or underlined. Too much, just makes a page look messy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accent_3782.jpg]\r\n\r\n10.
  No caps in body text\r\nThis one is simple enough. Never use capitals in body copy,
  it is just not as legible. Enough said.\r\n\r\n11. Always align to a baseline\r\nKeep
  text in simple horizontal lines. This is another body text rule and again seems
  pretty obvious. Ideally you use a baseline grid throughout. More details of how
  to that here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baseline_6125.jpg]\r\n\r\n12.
  Flush left ragged right\r\nAlways keep the text left aligned and don\u2019t justify.
  This is legible and does not look messy. Justifying text across a smaller column
  especially creates massive gaps or \u2018rivers\u2019 in the type. Don't do it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rivers_4580.jpg]\r\n\r\n13.
  Lines not too long or short\r\nLine length is also important. It helps legibility
  and prevents your eye from slipping up or down a line in a large body of text. My
  rule is do not have less than 6 words or more than 12 in a single line. Use columns
  in a page to make this structured and easy. Your page will be neater and more legible.\r\n\r\n14.
  Punctuation and Bullet points\r\nPunctuation marks and bullet points are something
  which is easily forgotten in typography. Modern design software does not make it
  easy for us to handle this correctly. Bullet points, should ideally be in the page
  margin. Not indented. Likewise, punctuation marks should be in the margin as well.
  The image below from Mark Boultons site illustrates this perfectly. You can see
  a tutorial for bullet points here, and punctuation marks here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotes_5787.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bullets_3835.jpg]\r\n\r\n15.
  The fibonnaci sequence\r\nthe first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1 and each other
  number is a combination of the previous 2. These numbers are meant to have a natural
  visual elegance to each other. Since the Renaissance, many artists and architects
  have proportioned their works to approximate the \u2018golden ratio\u2019. Therefore
  in typography it is a good suggestion to consider using only these numbers to structure
  your chosen point sizes to. It will give your whole document a natural elegance.\r\n\r\n0
  1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144...\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTypography is a massive subject
  and I am sure many will disagree with the suggestions I have made. Remember these
  rules are always made to be broken. With knowlege and experience comes the decision
  if it is appropriate to stick to or break these rules. These rules are kind of beginners
  guide to typography. Stick to them and I think you can\u2019t go far wrong.\r\n\r\nHope
  you have found useful. Do you disagree? \r\nIf you have any to add, please do.\r\n\r\nthe
