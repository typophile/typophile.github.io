body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/REVLON_6313.jpg]\r\n\r\nI was reading the
  introduction in Nick Shinn's 'The Modern Suite' which talks about his new Scotch
  Modern and about George Bruce.  At TypeCon I bought a little 1964 reprint of a specimen
  booklet from 'Geo. Bruce & Co.' c1848 in the hopes that I could find the origins
  for the type speciman below and above.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BRUCE_3825.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  sample is from the 1986 Revlon Annual Report which my (then) partner and I designed.*
  \ I recall that the type was Bruce something but have never found it since.\r\n\r\nCarol
  Wahler's gracious husband at the Type Directors Club in NYC found it for me in one
  of the catalogues from defunct photo-type houses in new york from the '80s.  I think
  it was called Bruce Roman.  The specimen we found was lovely; simple and clean and
  in my memory it reminds me of the line of thinking behind Scotch Modern.\r\n\r\nDoes
  \"Bruce\" ring anybody's bells?\r\n\r\n* The .jpg is from a .pdf saved from a scan
  from a dupe of a 35mm slide so the reproduction stinks.  The photography in the
  Report was done by David Seidner, Noelle Hoeppe and Michael Tighe who shoots a lot
  for Rolling Stone, or so he did.  The copy, and legal stuff was handled by Frankfurt,
  Gipps, Balkind, we took care of all the creative, art and printing.  Color seps,
  I believe, by Master Eagle.  The paper I can not recall but it was purchased and
  ready on the printing house floor.  Ronald O. Perlman took Revlon private so the
  piece was never printed; seps destroyed and paper probably reclaimed by the printer.
  \ A lot of money was spent and as much wasted. Only the second generation 35mm slides
  survive."

    remember using it, or at least having it pointed out to me, in the late 1980s.
    It's listed as a digital font for the 202, which is how I would have had it set.\r\n"

    \"for the 202\" mean?  I have some old Linotype catalogs but have never found
    a Bruce, do you have a specimen?  I would love to see a scan of it."
