body: Hey there  <BR> <BR>My name is Stuart Penny and I am currently studying Graphic
  Design in 4th year &#40;Honors&#41; at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. As
  part of my final year personal research project, I have initiated an exploration
  into illustrated typography. I have sent you this letter to request a contribution
  due to your experience and unique perspective on typography. <BR> <BR>To illustrate
  the idea that type, like humans, in their own way have individual characters and
  personality, I am asking you for a short story, statement, or quote depicting a
  moment in your type related life that either stirred, annoyed or even humored you.
  It may be something you saw, heard or even said about type or type design in the
  hope of uncovering how type portrays an individual personality, culture or time
  in which it was created. <BR> <BR>As each story will have its own personal tale
  I intend to hand illustrate each story typographically. Each story will then be
  unique and enforce the idea of individuality within type design.  <BR> <BR>For example
  I recieced an email the other day. with a picture of a video store called &#39;MEGA
  FLICKS&#34; the font used and with increadably tight kerning it read &#34;MEGA F/_/cKS!&#34;  <BR>
  <BR>If you have any questions e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:stupenny@yahoo.com">stupenny@yahoo.com</A>,
  or <A HREF="mailto:theworks@rmit.edu.au">theworks@rmit.edu.au</A>   <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for your time and I look forward to your response.
