  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi typophiles, (or typenerds as my wife calls us),

This is my first post inviting criticism of my design. 

I'm working on this informal script at the moment. I drew it with pen and ink first to get the thick/thin contrast, but I didn't want it to look 'Dickensian' - I'm trying to achieve a naturally flowing style without formal stiffness. I have completed the 'rough' style, and I thought it might look pretty good as a smooth style - so that's what I'm doing now.  I'm also going to produce a more refined 'fine' with as-thin-as-I-can-go thins style.

At the moment it is Postscript, but I'm toying with the idea of contextual alternates in Opentype. The FontLab manual is no great help as I find it to be written from a programmers viewpoint, unfortunately I'm a designer and a lot of that stuff goes way over my head. I wish Leslie Cabarga had written the manual, as his 'Learn FontLab Fast' has excellent illustrated step-by-steps, but is a bit brief in the OpenType section.

Does anybody know of any easy to understand intructions of exactly what to do, as I'm very impatient with plowing through the manual to extract the info.

Thanks in advance,

See new pdf. 28 November 2006

The script looks really beautiful. I like both the rough and clean styles. Since it's thicker than a lot of scripts it would be perfect for setting logos, and lots of other uses too, of course.

Sorry, I can't help you with OpenType, but check out build section for lots of posts on the subject.</div>

This last sample shows how interesting and vital this design can be. Please, DO take it to the next logical level and add contextual alternates. 1, 2 or 3 alternates per letter, plus a bunch of ligatures and final forms would make this a really exciting handwriting face. I think the rough version is best. 

If you are not versed in OpenType code, you might want someone to help you set that up. It can be confusing, and it definitely requires patience in testing, but I think the shapes you have already have terrific promise. 

This is unique in that it seems to be written with a pointed quill dipped in an inkwell. Very few script typefaces give that feeling. The 'splat' alternates will be like icing. Keep going!</div>

This is as far as I am to date - do I know when to stop? I don't think so! I could keep adding and adding forever, but have to draw the line somewhere, I do have other stuff to finish as well. I might do some fancy swash lower case alternates like the b, d, h, k, l, p, q and y, to go with the caps.

Many thanks for the previous comments BTW.

I can imagine that if I were to design a script typeface I would also have a difficult time knowing when to stop.

If anything your suggestion to make some swashier lowercase alternates to pair with the swash uppercase is a good idea. I feel like the lowercase doesn't quite match the swash uppercase, but a few alts would go very far in mending that.</div>

I know what you mean about the Swashes not matching the lower case:
The rest of the font looks 'fast' whereas the swash caps look like they were written by an enfeebled oldster. 

I don't know why, but I can't achieve that same fluency with the swashes, but I quite like that amateurish feel for them all the same.

I have an article somewhere that goes pretty deeply into the types of mistakes people make when writing.

The hard part I think might be simulating randomness. I know that PS code has/had something like that. But if there's no random function available, sufficient complexity (like making contextual decisions based on multiple and/or non-obvious criteria) can appear random.

The swashy lc does work with the swash UC better than without. I still love the entire idea of it and the shapes, swashy or not, are really nice. This looks hand-written to me. Fun!!</div>

I'm glad you think it looks hand-written. That's what I was trying to achieve with my first 2 scripts ITC Dartangnon and Gizmo, but I didn't have the technology then.

How will you approach combinations such as that in "Dea(r M)iss?" The way the r and M still bump I mean. Will you do a little replacement or are you going to delve that deeply?

How are you going about implementing these? I don't know the technology to tell how to do it, but I'm familiar enough to know that stylistic sets could help you. (I'm being redundant. Apologies.)

A clean and rough version of this would be nice as well. I'll go find my pom-poms so I can cheer you on. ;^)

I really don't feel like doing stylistic sets, as there is enough going on there anyway, and who in reality would use every feature? I have been neglecting other stuff which needs urgent attention.

I feel I'm coming to the end of this marathon, so it just needs finishing off now, and with a pdf of instructions for use!

Thanks everyone for your comments, it's good to have feedback on a project in progress. It has been a great help, and has given me some new ideas for making the font better and more complete.

If you think through the substitutions, alternates and default behavior, and get some assistance with the OpenType programming, instructions won't be necessary. You can definitely add dozens of alternates and ligatures, because I agree those will make this design all the more convincing and fluid, but it's unrealistic to think people will carefully select alternates. Wouldn't it really kick kiester to provide 2 or 3 different "states" or conditions? Consider offering stylistic variations like Formal, Casual, Feverish, Passionate. You set up the alternates and ligatures that create those different effects, and any user can choose which one is suitable for their copy, as a simple OpenType feature choice. 

One reason for this is that if you offer all the swash letters as a single option, you get a mess. It's likely to never look very good if all the swashes always appear together; and as you've already noticed, it really looks cool when you judiciously add a few swashes here and there. That would only be possible if you control what happens with each user choice. If you want assistance in setting up OT feature code, I suggest contacting Tal Leming or the House Industries gang; they have done great work setting up automatic substitutions, and I really think this design will be fully realized only with a lot of OpenType enhancement. I really like it, and I encourage you not to try to finish it too hastily. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Carl - I was thinking only of simple 'turn this option on and you get this' type of instructions. There are already dozens of alternates and ligatures which don't need to be carefully selected - they are standard replacement ligatures, even the swash variations.

A lot of 'designers' (these are seniors and art directors in London - and I'm not saying that London is the creative hub of the world either) haven't even heard of OpenType. Just that there is a lot of ignorance in this profession.

I'll think about what you say anyway.

Consider offering stylistic variations like Formal, Casual, Feverish, Passionate.  – sounds like a good idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, then you are really talking about a specimen, which I fully encourage. Definitely keep the options simple to use. Looks like we understand the user similarly. It's not just London where OpenType is still a foreign concept. ;) I just don't want you to miss opportunities for each of the options to be compelling, distinct, interesting, memorable, and especially, believable as handwriting. Your design is so vivacious, and there haven't been any really compelling, loose handwriting faces with all those bells and whistles, and yours could be the first one! Again I say, it's worth the extra fuss. 

Here are some other names you could consider for different states:

Humble Servant (very regular)
Wish You Were Here (more casual)
To My Dearest (gushingly, yet tastefully ornate, maybe add flowers, birds?)
Mad Genius (violent spatters)
Admiral Bombast (excessive ornate swashes, since sometimes this is what's wanted)
Beat Generation (spatters, fingerprints, coffee rings, etc)

How did you go about adding the roughness of texture to the non-smooth version? Did you have a piece of texture used to take "bites" out of the letterforms in Illustrator, or how did you go about it?

Thanks for the help, and great work on Olicana. BTW, is there a place in the US that distributes it?</div>

As Veer have an unreasonable new contract this situation will probably not be resolved, so it will probably be available through another distributor soon. It's silly really, as it was doing so well, especially after being named as one of Typographica's Favorite fonts of 2007. Anyway,  It is available through Fontworks UK (see Nov 7).

		<div class="commentbody">I have been moved by this typefce to make my first post - this strikes me as a magnificent creation Mr Nick. 

I have found almost all scripts to be a problem in one way or another based on my particular prejudices, and can think of only one or two instance of using one in my work over the last 11 years.

I am currently working on a Heritage project and this face would be ultra suitable for this so am keen to know when it becomes available. I have created a defacto face for the display implementation by digitising an original sample of a gothic face printed within the local area in 1851. Olicana will work beautifully in key paragraph settings and will add some real humanity to the various applications. 

Sorry to hear about your legal trevails.

When I try to install it  it installs as Calisto, but Calisto writes like Calisto, not Olicana.
I was looking thru my font library, and noticed that  none of my fonts end like Olicana does in .otf. Most other fonts end in .ttf
Any advice?

		<div class="commentbody">Beatriz, I'm sorry that Olicana isn't working for you, but unfortunately I have no idea why this should be. I have never heard of anybody having this problem before. Are you using FontBook? I never have any problems with that, and I've generated, uninstalled, regenerated and reinstalled Olicana many times when developing it. Did Chris's suggestion work? Have you tried uninstalling Calisto and then installing Olicana? I don't see why there should be a clash, if indeed there is one.
