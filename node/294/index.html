		<div class="commentbody">I think it is incorrect to separate the  from the  <BR>Acme with a period intervening. No matter what. The  <BR>implication in your approach (both 1 and 3 in your  <BR>example) is that the entire sentence (or at least the  <BR>clause &quot;call Acme&quot;) is the trademark. <BR> <BR>I would set the sentence order as Acme., then  <BR>kern the period under the , but not so far as  <BR>your #3 example. This way, also, your text is not  <BR>&quot;broken&quot; when repurposed into an environment  <BR>without kerning. <BR> <BR>That's my opinion as a designer, typographer, and editor. <BR> <BR><i>&gt;Crazy dedicated typographers do the  <BR>same with quotes over periods.</i> <BR> <BR>Crazy dedicated typographers who use well crafted  <BR>fonts shouldn't have to, as the quote-period kern pair  <BR>should be present in a good font. I also include kerns  <BR>for period-quote in my fonts. I have not, however,  <BR>heretofore built a kern pair for trademark-period.  <BR>But perhaps I will include it from here on out.

		<div class="commentbody">I am much less concerned with implying that a period or an entire sentence is part of the trademark than I am with that lonely period floating off by itself!  <BR> <BR>In general, I would pull the TM much closer to the word Acme than you have in any of the examples shown, CP.
