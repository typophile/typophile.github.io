  Does anyone have a suggestion for a font with similar characteristics that I could
  use as a substitute? The \"o's\" are not a problem; They're simple circles. The
  funky \"s\" and the \"m\" might be more of a challenge though? Any ideas folks?\r\nThanks!

  body: What about [[David Berlow]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.2958.6.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SOMOS&sampleSize=48">BerlinSans</a>,
    based on a design by [[Lucian Bernhard]]? Slightly more organic, but maybe that's
    not such a bad thing
