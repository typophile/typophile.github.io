  body: Now you&#39;re talking! <BR>That 153 is a primo shade. Now try adding a dark
    gray to bend the black. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>Thank you for your continued feedback. It is with no small
    amount of sheepishness however, that I must ask you to explain just a little more
    about bending the black with dark gray. <BR> <BR>I think I know what you mean,
    but am not sure...

  body: '&#34;Bending the black&#34;: I&#39;ve concluded that -unlike in a &#34;dumb&#34;
    automatic algorithm- shades of gray don&#39;t ideally work as in a continuum -
    different shades have qualitatively different functions. A medium gray &#40;like
    your 153&#41; works in an expected way perhaps &#40;creating the illusion of part
    of a pixel&#41;, but a dark gray is much more &#34;subvisible&#34; - it creates
    a hint of the black softening up, usually in &#34;preparation&#34; of an adjacent
    medium gray. As for light grays, try to avoid them &#40;since they create the
    most blur&#41;, but sometimes they still become the whole point of the exercise,
    oddly enough. Hard to explain... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
