    it in black and white first."

  body: I see what could be the stem of a plant and the tips of two leaves. Not the
    part of a plant the juice comes from. Possibly suitable for tea, but as Riccardo
    says, it looks a bit rigid.

    in the nectar part.\r\nFound myself diggin too deep so i thought to check and
    see if you think that it is a good direction. \r\nThe second version is a (poor)
    try to turn the U into a flower...still not finished.\r\nThe logo should carry
    some elegance tone.\r\n\r\n(almost..) any feedback will be appriciated :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nElsi\r\n

    weedy & leaning left, maybe chuck a stem for the flower in & see if thats cool?\r\nin
    fact you could just go with option 1 in my opinion..\r\nthe typeface isn't my
    cup of tea but i can see why you chose it\r\nkia ora"

    look nicer if it was positioned horizontally or flying upwards slightly above
    the letters - giving it a \"so free I'm about to fly away\" feeling. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    the ct is not right, kerning plus c sloping differently from the other letters.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Nantucket Nectars \"Real is Better\", you've just got to wonder if they import
    their orange concentrate from Brazil like most other brands."

  body: "I'm not keen on the hummingbird, but if you use it I think it should be stylised
    in the same way as the flower u. However, and this might just be because I'm a
    gardener, but the flower looks like a tulip. Not something likely to be visited
    by a hummingbird.\r\n\r\nA problem I have with the hummingbird and flower idea
    is that it is taking the \"nectar\" part of the name too literally. This is a
    juice company. Nectar and juice are not the same thing although nectar is a well
    known metaphor for a sweet drink. Hence Nantucket Nectars, nectar of the gods,
    etc. Unless this company happens to be using flower nectars I'd try a direction
    that says juice & fruit rather than flowers and pollinators."

  body: "Sorry, I wasn't clear. I like the hummingbird too. It's a good symbol for
    nectar. I don't like the drinking out of the letters bit. That's corny. It would
    look better if it was just flying around - gives the idea of being free and natural.\r\n\r\nActually,
    I think that the company name would sound better as \"Natural Nectar\" rather
    than \"Natural Nectars\", it sounds more natural, but that's outside the scope
    of this forum."
