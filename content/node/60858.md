    me to align the text left, next to the icon, and try aligning it to the grey dots.\r\n\r\nI
    meant text like this:\r\ncampaign\r\ncompliance\r\nLLC\r\n\r\nAnd is there a reason
    for not capitalizing the wordmark/name?\r\n\r\nI like the icon btw..."

  body: 'I like the mark. And your font choice works nicely with the circular forms
    complementing the dots of the mark. I''d be curious to see it tried with a squarer
    font to play off the square shaped interlocking Cs. The alignment of the mark
    and the type isn''t working for me yet. #1 is ok but it might be more interesting
    to move the type up to align with the bottom row of dark dots. #2 looks awkward.
    #3 the placement of LLC (plus it being the only caps) puts too much emphasis on
    LLC. I like Marco''s suggestion. however, stacking the type will be a challenge
    because campaign and compliance are much longer than llc.'

    end up with the second one here:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Horizontal-CC_6559.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm not sure what to do about the vertical iteration. Should I just stick with
    the centered mark, and the type all on one line?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vertical-CC_6735.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
    an alternate font, I was looking at [[http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/115|PAZ]]
    by sudtipos, but don't currently own it. Not sure if it's worth the purchase either."

  body: "I'd like to see the mark and type positioned a little closer to each other
    on all of the versions. On the last design try setting the type smaller, so that
    the o is the same size as the dots and then align each row with the light gray
    dots, may even want to try in all caps. \r\n\r\nNo don't buy anything just to
    test unless it's a font you've had your eye on for a while and envision using
    elsewhere."

  body: I like the very last version, but would it be a no-no to put LLC on the same
    line as compliance? Then align it to the bottom of the logo? Then the logo and
    words will have a similar step/raggedness and they will be harmonious. I hope
    that makes sense. :-b

  body: "<cite>so that the o is the same size as the dots and then align each row
    with the light gray dots</cite>\r\n\r\nIt may not look like it, but the 'o' is
    the same size as the dots in all those versions.\r\n\r\nHere are a few more versions
    following some of the suggestions. Mark and word spacing is done according to
    a grid based off of the height of one of the dots or the letter 'o'/'c'. One space
    between words on the same line and anywhere between 2 and 4 spaces between mark
    and type.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CC1_6284.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CC2_6446.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CC3_6118.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CC4_4883.jpg]"

    colors i like in the book and then having the cmyk representation look completely
    different. What's the best way to get around that? Pick the pantones for print
    and then on my own find a suitable cmyk alternative for web use? That's what I've
    done here with the 802c green. In the book, its more of a fluorescent green rather
    than washed out as its cmyk reproduction indicates above. So I bumped up the levels
    myself for this new set of colors. Or should I just pick a different, easier to
    work with green?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COLOR_5742.jpg]\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\npenn"

    on the paper you are going to use. this print contains one only the Pantone, and
    one full CMYK with a few variations. Out of these variations one can pick the
    closest to the Pantone print.\r\n\r\nAlso, for final colors, its really hard to

  body: I like the upper left color scheme best as well. I would pick the PMS colors
    in the book, then use the the color bridge book to find a suitable CMYK alternative.
    I often find that the closest 4-color match to a given PMS color is a few shades
    off from what the book tells me.
