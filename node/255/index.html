  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So here's the latest from Friday Fonts, which has creeped into saturday, monday and <BR>tuesday fonts! oops! A dangerous game I'm playing.  <BR> <BR>I moved in a different direction from Neweue Helpetica. I was feeling like it was too close <BR>to helvetica and others. Simply adding a few alternate letterforms would not do. I haven't <BR>totally scrapped what I was up to. If there's a  <BR>major outcry, I will keep working on it. <BR> <BR>So now I have a complete upper and lower case for a new font. But, I think the caps are a  <BR>hair too dark for the text! Overall though I like the flair of this one. A few things are still there:  <BR>notably the k. Stay tuned for a glyph chart. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank guys. <BR> <BR>The big question I'm facing before moving on is: are the caps too dark for the lower case? Right now the caps are 112% heavier than the lower case. Is there a rule of thumb on this? <BR> <BR>I desperately need a nice laser printer if i'm going to get serious about this. I've attached another pdf that shows what I'm talking about. Anyone want to take a look at a print? :-)  <BR> <BR>I've made a few minor adjustments since the last look.

		<div class="commentbody">I whole-heartedly agree with earlier posts that this effort warrants further work&hellip; congratulations! Based upon my first and immediate reaction, I prefer the second of the three lower case &quot;a's&quot;. And one other observation (that may be due to my failure to renew a prescription more than keen typographic analysis) is that the vertical strokes of some upper case characters seem to bow out more than the normal optical illusion. They bring to mind jfp's brilliant suggestion for the &quot;y&quot; diagonal strokes in the recently posted yesyes logo. Again, congratulations.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again all for the suggestions. <BR> <BR>The main thing I've changed in this PDF is the <BR>weight of the caps. now they are 106% of the  <BR>lower case.

I felt the tail fit nicely into <BR>the space left by the upper or lower case U. <BR> <BR>Oh, JFP: I was wondering about the cap J.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm liking the texture in your latest sample. <BR>And I think the cap weight is just fine now. <BR> <BR>&gt; symmetrical traps <BR> <BR>BTW, you can make asymmetrical traps using the Flower by revolving the new corner point along its circle, to the desired spot. Also, you can compensate for greater bleed in one dimension than the other by using [properly aspected] concentric ellipses instead of circles. <BR> <BR>&gt; The Q: I've always thought this is the one place  where you get to take a few liberties. <BR> <BR>You're right - on second thought it's probably just fine (and cute to boot) - as long as it doesn't clot on you. <BR> <BR>Descending UC &quot;J&quot;s: I personally love them. To me the only reason not to have it descending is for display work, and only if the &quot;Q&quot; is also non-descending (which rarely looks good though). Some people say that a descending &quot;J&quot; doesn't really help spacing, since it rarely occurs except as the first letter of a word/name - but of course that's a highly Anglo view - type designers from LJUBLJANA (they do exist) probably have nightmares about non-descending &quot;J&quot;s&hellip; I really think they help in every way. <BR> <BR>BTW, an idea for showing caps: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/1329.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/1329.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/1329.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi all.  <BR> <BR>I've started on a black version of this font. As I mentioned in another thread, I'm thinking of  <BR>light, regular, bold and black for the final family. So far I pleased with the caps, but  <BR>chose to post the lc before finishing because I was unsure and wanted feedback. I know that  <BR> <BR>Big question is: does the black lc accuratly hold to the character of the regular version. I  <BR>had to add some stroke contrast (there's no other way to get it all in!). I also chose to  <BR>emphasis the squareness of the glyphs a bit more. I tried the same and less, and in both  <BR>cases I felt like it lost some of the regular's feel. One area of concern is on the terminals  <BR>(a, c, e, r, f etc) with the added stroke contrast they can start to look way different. I've tried  <BR>two versions of the a. What do you think? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy   <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11638.gif" alt="black"></div>
