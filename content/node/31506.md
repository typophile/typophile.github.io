    should also look for the Emil Ruder spacing test (because I'm sure someone has
    it online). I found both of these very useful, but only discovered them after
    I had typed out all the kerning pairs and all the pangrams I could think of in
    QX."

  body: "I went and looked at kernking. I suppose it can be useful, but I did notice
    it left out one of my favorite \"pairs,\" namely Yg. I once had to set a book
    involving the Artherian legend, and Arther's mom, Ygraine, came up a lot. It should
    go without saying I had to go back & re-kern the font; I'd missed it in my early
    effort.\r\n\r\nAs a typesetter, I've been kerning fonts since 1980 or so. That
    means that I've had a lot of practice, but it also means I'm a bit set in my ways,
    so you can take what I say with a grain of salt. At this point, If I'm serious
    about a text font, I look at all combinations of letters and punctuation, as lowercase,
    as cap-lowercase, and as cap-cap.\r\n\r\nSince the advent of Fontographer, and
    now FontLab, it has gotten easier. Both have a metrics window that lets you put
    up whole words, with spaces. I make sure the \"metrics window\" has about five
    words, with spaces, and then run through the pairs. With tricky letters, such
    a cap-V or cap-W, I make sure I look at not pairs, but triplets -- if you use
    WAVE for kerning the \"A\", you'll wind up with a very different decision than
    if you use WARF. And of course, same with the lower case.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    you will notice, especially if you are making your own font, it that you can pick
    sidebearings for the caps to either work well (minimal kerning needed) with other
    caps, or work well with lowercase letters, but rarely both. One or the other will
    needs more work.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the numbers, and numbers with endashes, commas,
    and periods.\r\n\r\nYou will notice -- I hope you will notice -- that too tight
    is worse than not-quite-tight-enough. The font itself will give you some hints
    on how it should be kerned & spaced. I'll change sidebearings & re-kern if need
    be. The lower-case \"f\" is a typical candidate. In order to skip kerning with
    the vowels, some designers will give it a large negative right sidebearing. When
    the \"f\" is the last letter in the word, the wordspace will get too small. So
    they'll add a \"f space\" positive kern. But that's a patch, if you get it right
    for \"of Wilbur\" it will be wrong for \"of anything\". Better to get the sidebearings
    right & deal with the letters.\r\n\r\nAfter almost 30 years of practice, It takes
    me about 4-6 hours to kern a font for the Latin alphabet, and maybe another hour
    after I see the first book printed, and a little bit of \"font maintenance\" from
    time to time as I see the results from other books. That's a plus a compositor
    has over a type designer, I suppose. But this is a small amount of time to spend
    on a font; far far less than it took the original designer."

  body: "Pretty much. The only lowercase/uppercase pair I routinely look at is \"c\",
    as in Mac- or Mc- (All capitals). Punctuation/uppercase is usually limited to
    the apostrophe (Unicode 2019), the open & doubleopen quotes, and periods with
    a few abbreviations such as U.S.A and D.C. where the period needs a kern to the
    following letter (particularly the \"A\"). The same would be true of punctuation/smallcap,
    since abbreviations & acronyms are often set in small caps.\r\n\r\nI dunno if
    I should include small caps in that optomistic time estimate; it would certainly
    push it toward or more likely over the 6 hour figure. Too, the itals & bolds tend
    not to have small caps, though I usually make up a rudimentary set [where the
    EULA allows this, of course ;)]. The occurrence of ital or bold small caps is
    usually so low in the work I do that they could be handled in the job file --
    esp. when a designer has chosen a font no one will ever use again.\r\n\r\nWe all
    evolve our routines, and since I primarily set scholarly monographs \u2013 and
    not even the jackets \u2013 certain kinds of things tend not to arise. And as
    I said, I have to go back & fix \u2013 and add \u2013 things with the kerning
    from time to time.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that helps me move along is I only try
    to get things right for text-size settings, say 8 to 12 point. I've always felt
    that in display setting, you have to do your kerning as it comes up. What is right
    for 18-point is not right for 72-point.\r\n\r\nHope that answers the question,\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n"

  body: "This is just a way of looking at the problem but, shouldn't we design kern
    tables for individual languages? Or to take it further, for individual publications
    in their particular context (country, particular way of writing, most common words,
    etc)? Like for the special case Charles mentioned above, with Ygraine?\r\n\r\nAnd
    if writing the tables for particular languages, shouldn't we use sample texts
    specially designed for those languages?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"My\" pair for instance,
    would be really rare in Spanish, except for the cases of proper names such as
    \"Myriam\" (Which isn't very spanish-like by the way). So it wouldn't be of huge
    relevance in the tables. But not the same applies for the English language, were
    the pair \"My\" is very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that maybe samples like Kern
    King work best when getting to know how the font works with the default spacings,
    but becomes less useful when writing the kern tables. For those, it would be useful
    to design texts according to the language/country the font will be used in, and
    ideally offer different packages for different countries.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
    if theres available data about the most common (irregular) pairs on English or
    other languages?\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a list of the irregular pairs in the
    basic Latin alphabet?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"
