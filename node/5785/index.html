		<div class="commentbody">Nigel, this quote that you keep referencing is not even Linotype's main marketing push behind Avenir. This line appears on the inside cover of the broschure. It is not the &quot;tagline&quot; of the font family, just a quote from the designer himslef that is quite liked. Put this into perspective: Adrian Frutiger is one of the world's most respected type designers, living or dead. To insinuate that he is a font pirate is unfair. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linotype does sell basic commercial in its webs shop. The font description clearly states that it is based on the design of AG. I do not know anything about its design, but Linotype is not trying to cover up, or deny the existence of AG, or Berthold's right to sell it. BC is not a copyright infringement of their work in any country or jurisdiction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope that my views and opinions do not sound excessive. Although I am an employee of Linotype, I am not expressing any sort of official sentiments in my posts. This is all personal. To further elaborate, I will cease being an employee of LL on Sunday, as my German work permit has temporially expired. However, I would have gladly responded to your mis-formed opionions in the same fashion before I worked here, or knew any of its employees. And I can guarantee you that I will be just as feisty on Monday, because your viewpoint on Avenir is too complexly silly for me to possibly understand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First you should get some sleep. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is quite easy for anyone to lookup online in the German trademark database that all of H. Berthold AG's trademarks were assigned to Berthold Types Limited early in 1998. I am sure Linotype can help you with this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the ATypI survey people were harsh about Monotype and Book Antiqua. Linotype is no better, that's all. It is the nature of the type industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Linotype &quot;officially&quot; is interested in this post then they should join in rather than have you be their voice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also noticed the other day that Linotype has applied for the &quot;Eurostile&quot; trademark in the U.S. When did they acquire those rights exclusively?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, Linotype is well aware of its own rights and legal satanding, and does not need to officially respond to your statements on this forum, which as Yves pointed out, are deliberately troll-like. While they do not need to officially respond. I personally  feel differently. I cannot understand how you can possibly agree with the statements you have entered here. Linotype, as a company, is not the one posting derogatory comments on several different web sites. It was you who started this discussion by trying to paint Linotype's Avenir Next in a false light. As I have recently designed a few promotional pieces for Avenir Next, I feel that your comments are a deliberate questioning of my ethical allegiances. I responding out of my own accord. I would not design type samples for stolen designs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the post that I made earlier this morning WAS slightly influenced by Linotype. Your defending of Berthold is a reiteration of a tired argument over the nature of that company. Linotype did assist me in a preliminary search of German trademark records. This preliminary search proved no apparent results for a Trademark on Akzidenz. The new Berthold DOES have many trademarks registered in Germany, however, I could not see AG on the list. Therefore, I am asking you directly to back up your statement, which I think is perfectly logical. I would do the same. If AG is registered here, Linotype would like to know that. As far as it is concerned, AG is not registered here at all. I am not denying Berthold's right to sell Akzidenz Grotesk. I also did a bit of asking around about Basic Commercial, since its provenance was specifically asked about. Again, for the last time, I am not a lawyer or spokesperson for the Linotype Library. I was, however, hired because in part because I am a native speaker (of English). I wrote the last post beacause I can write better English than most of the employees in the company (although I personally think that my writing is terribly awful! If I could be more concise, this argument would be over). If you would like to continue this discussion in German, I'm sure that you would get some interesting responses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as I am aware, there will be no &quot;official statement&quot; from Linotype, because my above points are correct, and Linotype has nothing to hide. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Besides, as far as I know, &quot;official statements&quot; are really something for the lawyers. None of us here are lawyers. Ideally, we would all friends talking about the things we love most. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eurostil: On our website, it states that Eurostile is a registered trademark of Nebiolo. I do not know anything further about its case, however, Linotype would not register anything with anyone if it were a violation of any of its standing contracts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First you brought up Avenir Next in an attempt to paint Linotype in a bad light. No one held your argument for valid that Avenir is a Futura rip-off. Then you brought up Basic Commercial, which is not illegally sold (or named) either. Now, you are offended by some sort of purported moral violation on behalf of Eurostil. You seem to be grasping for straws.I am finding it difficult to maintain an appropriate level of coordial dialogue under these circumstances.</div>

However, note that there is currently no copyright owner on the design of Akzidenz-Grotesk even in Germany. The design was created more than 100 years ago for a now defunct company. The copyright has expired and there is no current owner.

Linotype sold Akzidenz-Grotesk under one (Adobe) or two (H. Berthold AG) license agreements. One of the fundamental aspects of trademark law is that if you take a license for something you are prevented from challenging that which you licensed. &quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You seem to be ignoring the fact that trademarks are one thing and designs are another thing. While in the U.S. copyright does not generally apply to typeface designs, in the E.U. it does, or at least may. Speaking in European standards, and according to the Berne convention, the design of (the basic cuts of) Akzidenz Grotesk is public domain, the authors have been dead for a very long time and the company which marketed the designs is no more. The additional weights that have been created later by G.G.

Just because you repeat over and over again in an online forum that this is a legal fact does not make it true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In one respect, you are sadly not H Berthold AG's successor: H Berthold AG was one of the most respected player in the type business. It is clear that your new incarnation of the Berthold name, legal or not, has lost this respect, and that regaining it is not a priority. This is the feeling I get from reading your posts, as well as the tone of Bouncer and Nigel Hamilton's post, who are most likely just further aliases of yours. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How about you just try being nice? Mies van der Rohe (ridiculous name dropping, I know, but the quote is great) once said that it was almost important to fight <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for something,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not against something. How about we all work together as one community to protect all of our interests? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Please don't answer my post by saying something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;I would personally LOVE to work with the rest of community, but bad apples like that former employer of yours are already breaking the rules, so why should I follow them?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This would just be the repetition of a tired argument that is not upheld by anyone&hellip;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Linotype propaganda. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know who you are, Nigel. But you're obviously hellbent on making a name for yourself by taking sides against the big guys &ndash; well, a couple of them &ndash; and creating a riot. The way in which you're doing this in this thread has not convinced me of your insight in letterforms, or of your intelligence. It did remind me of Beavis and Butthead at some point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->H Hunt: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Berthold Types owns the entire remaining type assets <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now Berthold Types &ndash; that's a different thing. It seems to be tricky to comment on it in public because the company has a reputation for sueing anyone who expresses an opinion of it &ndash; as well as the forum where this happens. [Disclaimer: this is me, in Europe, expressing an opinion; Typophile has nothing to do with it.]  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But as you're reading this anyway Mr Hunt: what is true of the rumor that you are reluctant to pay copyrights or percentages to the living designers whose typefaces you have  &quot;inherited&quot; from Berthold AG? Don't you agree that taking care of designers in a proper and decent way is the first duty of anyone claiming to represent a heritage of designs &ndash; and not just a bunch of legally protected font names? I'm not talking about finding a legal way *out* of paying rights: anyone with good lawyers, a lot of stamina and low moral values can do that. I'm talking about taking up responsabilities to living creative people. And ultimately, about being a good &quot;father&quot; of the cultural heritage you've acquired.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: this is not an accusation, it's a question. You answer it convincingly, I shut up. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jan</div>
