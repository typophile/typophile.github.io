  I've taken a lot of photos of; while my wife is shopping in thrift stores, I look
  for things to take photos of. One Goodwill near us always has a big turnover in
  dolls."

    me uncomfortable. When I said you could use my words for a fontplay, I didn't
    understand that it would be on the board the next day. It felt very strange but
    I didn't say a word. I am now.\r\n\r\nNo big thing, I'm still intact and functioning
    as well as ever (whatever that's worth), just wanted to let you know how I felt\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"

    and see of anyone else thinks this is not a good idea. \r\n\r\nI have lots of
    fonts, and lots of images, but what to use for text is constantly a struggle.
    I check bumper sticker sites, quote sites, etc. for things to use. So I am so
    pleased when I find something that seems like it could be used.\r\n\r\nI don't
    see Nick in my IM window to see if he minds, and hrant can take it and dish it
    out, if I'm not mistaken."
