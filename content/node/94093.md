  Script]]\r\n\r\nHere's the thing \u2013 I really need a consistent family across
  numerous alphabets (Latin, Eastern European, Greek, Cyrillic, numerous Asia/Pacific
  scripts). It also has to have an EULA that allows unlimited page views per month.\r\n\r\nSound
  impossible? My money's on \"probably\". Can anyone help?\r\n"

  body: "Sorry, I didn't word that very clearly. I just meant major alphabets currently
    in use in the Asia/Pacific region \u2013 simplified Chinese, kanji, hiragana,
    katakana, etc. I know that's asking a lot, and I think I'm SOL but I'm just researching
    this to see if it's a possibility.\r\n\r\nI'd just select faces that closely resemble
    what I'm looking for in each region, but you know\u2026 one man's Verveine is
    another man's Comic Sans."

  body: "Writing styles are not consistent in all those languages so you can't really
    have a 'one size fits all' design that would accomodate both Chinese variants
    as well as Chinese, Korean, Thai, etc.\r\n\r\nThat's not even getting into the
    fact that sometimes the same character in Chinese actually has a different form
    than in Japanese.  For East Asian fonts at least, each font has to be specifically
    tuned for the language in question or it won't \"look right\" to somebody."
