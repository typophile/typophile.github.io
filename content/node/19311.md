  body: I think this is the dreaded Adobe Serif substitution font. It's anybody's
    guess what missing font it's standing in for.

  body: "Oh, man...don't tell me that..  :(\r\n\r\nIs there a less convoluted method
    of verifying that possibility than creating the text in an Adove program in some
    font that I don't have and then seeing if Adobe uses the serif sub font?  Like,
    for example, does this \"Serif\" font exist somewhere I can call it up?"

  body: Aarrgh...I added it to "Font Book" and Suitcase, but i can't get it to show
    up in an application I can use.  If you are correct that this font is the Adobe
    SerifMM font, I may just go back to the client and say "Hey, great time for a
    logo redesign, wouldn't you say?" (I basically volunteered to convert their logo
    which only exists in GIF form(!) into something they could actually use, like
    a vector file).

  body: "The problem with trying to use Adobe SerifMM is that it is a Multiple Master
    font. Adobe's type engine, which is used in all Adobe software, sees that a font
    is missing, looks it up in its internal database and, if it know about it, will
    adjust the weight and width axes of Adobe SerifMM to mimic the weight and proportions
    of the missing font. (There is also Adobe SansMM for missing sans serif fonts.)\r\n\r\nSo,
    assuming you could get it to show up in your font menu (and don't ask me how Tiffany
    did it--I don't know), you would need a program that can manipulate MM font axes,
    and most of those are from the pre-OS X days (on the Mac anyway).\r\n\r\nIs there
    perhaps a printed version of their logo that uses the correct font? Maybe some
    stationery or a brochure?"

    body: "I may try to load up Illustrator 8 on my Mac and run it in classic mode,
      if I really need to create an outlined version.  It's my understanding that
      this logo was created in the early days of this company by a designer(?) that
      they no longer do business with. Essentially, the only version of this logo
      that exists at all is the one that has been kicking around their website for
      a while.  I have done some web work for them and I offered to create a vector
      version of the logo so they wouldn't have to keep blowing up the gif file to
      obscene proportions every time they run a print ad, or forego using their logo
      entirely.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to recreate the logo with a different, more viable
      font, and if they really NEED me to exactly duplicate the old one, go into Illustrator
      and hand-manipulate the outline until it looks like the old font.  I am starting
      with some variations on Bookman and/or Book Antiqua (sp?) that I think may serve
      nicely."

  body: Century Old Style may be a good starting point if you go that route. FWIW,
    I don't think you will be able to coax any version of Illustrator to let you work
    with either of the Adobe substitution fonts directly. They are meant to operate
    invisibly behind the scenes.

  body: Just thinking that it seems unlikely that the substitution font is being seen
    by accident, standing in for another, as recolouring the dot on the "i" would
    have been done after converting the text to outlines.

      name: alldaveallen
    body: That IS a good point, but at the risk of drawing some incorrect conclusions
      about the designer, I think the dot may have been colored in after the image
      was converted to a bitmap.

  body: That's a good point, but it's also possible that the original designer used
    a dotless i and drew the dot.
