body: "Hello type lovers!\r\nI'm currently designing a typeface with two layers or
  colors. I think it is more useful to program this kind of things than doing them
  manually when you set some text. So, my doubt is about opentype programming, how
  can I make this using an OT feature? I'm pretty sure it is possible to do it, I've
  been looking up for information about it and so far I haven't find anything.\r\nSorry,
  I could not upload the image to the forum, so I uploaded it to my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/elibaal/4014785159/\">flickr
  gallery.</a>\r\nThanks in advance."

    a single font, get all of the metrics working, and then split it into two fonts,
    so that a text box can be duplicated on top of itself and the font changed. "

  body: Hello James, I have seen the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/freefonts/">ffdingbats</a>
    and the demo version works in layers with stylistic alternates.

  body: "Sorry, I thought that you were asking if you could use OpenType to automatically
    assign color to parts of the type.\r\n\r\nI think that what ffdingbats does is
    use the stylistic set to switch to versions that have no width and/or are positioned
    to the left of the left sidebearing so that they overlap. This makes sense for
    these dingbats because they aren\u2019t going to see much interaction after being
    set. But if you do it with letters things could get really ugly when you decide
    to change the copy or start recoloring stuff (because the text is going to start
    reflowing and possibly leave its frame), so I think it would be easier on the
    end-user if you just use multiple fonts."

  body: The only further spin on multiple layer typography I've seen is Typotheque's
    <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history_remixer>History Remixer</a> for
    their <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history/about>History typeface</a>.
    They offer this Web application to those who have licensed History; it will export
    a high-resolution PDF based on the settings input.

  body: "In pre-OpenType days when I was still a student at RIT, I made a collection
    of fonts that could be used to create multi-color borders. The idea was you'd
    type a \"master\" character (e.g. top-left corner), then change fonts (and colors,
    if you like) and type the corresponding overlay piece; repeat for each element.
    The overlaid pieces all had zero advance widths, with the master controlling escapement
    across the page. It was a pain in the ass, to be sure, but it worked and there
    was really no other alternative for nice borders at the time (beyond Quark's lame-o
    raster-based frames).\r\n\r\nThings aren't really much different at the font level
    today; you still can't specify colors inside of a font. You can code in substitutions/ligatures,
    etc. but that doesn't really help, because you need to intercept the substitution
    to change color on the different parts. So you have the hassle of doing that all
    manually*, or the hassle of introducing a custom application (as Monotype BorderMaker
    did back in the early 1990s) and export/import (and probably losing some editability
    along the way).\r\n\r\n*With the various scripting technologies that are more
    widely available in apps today, this kind of thing could possibly be made a bit
    easier on an end-user, but OpenType itself doesn't really bring anything new to
    the game (other than slightly more convenient packaging). And of course then you
    have the problem of having to create and maintain the scripts, in addition to
    the font.\r\n"

    contact me directly by email (yar fontlab.com), it could be interesting.
