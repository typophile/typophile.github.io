body: "I have been struggling with this one for a week - the R, E, S, C, E, A, D say
  Perpetua but the Q and U are not right (maybe alternates). Comes from a 1950s copy
  of Picture Post (UK version of Life magazine) I have yet to look at a sample book
  I have from 1958 by Maurice Ward which I think has a funny cut of Perpetua in it.
  If anyone can shed some light, I will ashamed but appreciative. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rescue_squads_6171.gif]\r\n\r\nBen"

  body: I think it is Perpetua, with the Q and U manipulated. That U looks awful IMHO.

  body: "Perpetua Titling has a Q more like that, apparently to keep everything above
    the baseline. I'm looking at a sample from the 'Homage to the Alphabet' book from
    Phil's Photo (1985), which only shows a Light weight, but maybe there was also
    a Bold. This book shows film types from the pre-digital times.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Titling Bold</a> by Monotype, and the Q is not the same as in the film type.\r\n\r\n-

    had a metal Perpetua Titling Bold face, which matches your sample exactly.\r\n\r\n-
