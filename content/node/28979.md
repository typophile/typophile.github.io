  'Experiments With Letterform and Calligraphy' and designed Egyptian 505, Basilia,
  and other things as well.\r\n\r\n I found reference to his working with Team 77.
  Is this the same place? http://www.team77.de\r\n\r\nHere is more info:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/411/andreguertler.html?PHPSESSID=239a012999ab33a5442b08ff93318cff"

    of Basil students who designed the first  Oblique typefaces for the ITC Avant
    Garde Gothic family. They did this in 1977. Hence the name\u2026\r\n\r\nIts just
    like Egyptian 505, which was designed by his class at the Basel School in\u2026
    Room 505!\r\n\r\nMaybe you can try the Basel telephone book (online?), and write
    him a letter? Alternatively, you could try to get in touch with Hannes Famira,
    who seems to have moved to Brooklyn from Basel. He was teaching in Basel for a
    few year recently ( Oblique typeface). Maybe all all Basel lettering people know
    each other."
