body: "Well, thanks to Eric I was browsing the Neufville site, and to my very\r\npleasant
  surprise discovered that Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida's Pascal face,\r\noriginally
  released in foundry metal towards the end of the 1950s, is\r\nfinally available
  digitally, in a high-quality and \"official\" version!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.neufville.com/FontData/_Pascset.htm\r\n\r\nFor
  now only the display cut is available, but the text cuts are\r\nplanned, and to
  me at least that's where the design really sings.\r\nAlthough the metal Pascal I
  own only goes down to 30 point, the\r\nsmaller samples I've seen (not easy to find
  mind you) are great.\r\nThat said, the sparkle of this display cut is really captivating.\r\n\r\nLadies
  and gentlemen, this is one fine piece of work. I rarely get\r\nthis glowing about
  a font, so I hope discerning typographers will\r\ntake the time to look at it closely,
  hopefully purchase it*, and\r\nundoubtedly use it to great effect. From what I understand
  Mendoza\r\ny Almeida was personally involved in this new digital release, and\r\nI
  think one can tell.\r\n\r\n* I actually had trouble figuring out how and where to\r\nbuy
  it, but I've just asked Neufville for clarification.\r\n\r\nIn the caps the comparison
  with Optima is inescapable. But in the\r\nmore important lowercase it goes where
  Optima's manner is simply\r\ntoo prissy, its gown too delicate, its complexion too
  pallid.\r\n\r\nPascal is to Optima what Princess Stephanie is to Grace Kelly.\r\nTo
  me at least, much more alive and interesting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
