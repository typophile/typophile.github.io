    about the \"r\" does not look right in Charter Bold.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate
    your work with me on this."

  body: "I just looked through all the slabserifs at MyFonts, and I think Charter
    does look like the best match. The regular weight has a closer 'r', and maybe
    the weight of your sample looks heavier than it is. I'm with Jan.\r\n\r\n- Mike
