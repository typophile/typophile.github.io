  body: 'I would suggest that you post some images of trhe font so we can see what
    you have & so you can describe what you feel still needs to be done. Then I am
    sure someone may be able to help you sort it out yourself - or offer their services.
    If you really want it sorted out for you; try to get clear what terms you would
    be willing to accept. '
