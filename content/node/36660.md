  anyone help me find a font similar to that used for the \"Mourning Warehouse,\"
  (what a name for a funeral home!), and \"Regent Street, London\"?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Yes, thanks Renko but those were amongst the first places I looked.\r\n\r\nWalden
    Font is great, but of course their stuff is focused around the Wild West and Civil
    War genres.\r\n\r\nLetterhead has one or two that are kinda close, but not really.\r\n\r\nScriptorium
    and Weischer came up as blanks.\r\n\r\nThanks though for taking the time to make
    suggestions."

  body: To me "Mourning Warehouse" looks like a slightly customized (the tail on the
    R) Cheltenham Condensed. Just make sure you don't use the ITC version.

  body: "Hmmm. I do see the similarities. Somehow though this still looks more distinctive
    and idiosyncratic to me.\r\n\r\nWhy not the ITC version?"

  body: Because I find the ITC versions of those vintage faces usually kinda sucky.
    O:^) Sandpapered to death, neutered and with x-heights you could drive a truck
    through.

    keeping fingers crossed that someone can come up with something even closer to
    the sample provided.\r\n\r\n"
