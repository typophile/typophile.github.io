I own a MacBook Pro i7 2,8 Ghz processor with 8 GB memory, 250 MB SSD, Lion installed (10.7.4) with FontLab 5.1.2 (4447).

Problem:
Crashes constantly (ten times a day) an irregular but usually when editing in glyph-window-mode.

Any one else with similar setup – do you have this problem?

Right now I’m looking for replacement software like ”Glyphs” any suggestions?

–FontLab, SHAPE-UP!!!
In one years time I’m going to need retina-supported software as well!

		<div class="commentbody">I'm still running Snow Leopard. I'll probably update to Lion when I'm reasonably confident about the latest version of FontLab. My only complaint with the Parallels approach is that it can be slow if I have more than a few apps running.

I'm running Windows 7 under Parallels v.7 (build 7.0.15106)  . I tried installing an early Win8 beta under Parallels, but it didn't seem to work; I'll probably try again with the release version, presuming that Parallels might need updating to handle it.

Yes, I also run VOLT this way. Actually, I do almost all my work on the Mac in the Windows environment, since that is what I am used to. I only use the Mac OS for running UFO tools like Prepolator and UFOStretch. Oh, and for watching films.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I assume you mean the FontBureau folks? Since they were big sponsors for RoboFont, they probably had great input on what went into it and became committed to using it because of their involvement.  I don't think the "Best Stuff" comment is applicable or even important.  My guess would be that the Brothers Berlow needed something that fit into their workflow and were sick and tired of waiting for FontLab to fix their mess. You have worked with FB so you know more than I but it seems to me that they had a set of tools from several sources (Metrics Machine included) that did everything but be a drawing tool. They then made RoboFont into their drawing tool and kissed the bug-infested prior software of choice goodbye. They have the developers of RoboFont on speed dial and are listened to quickly there.
This has nothing to do with "best stuff" and everything to do with an efficient production process that is not held hostage by the snail-paced exterminators at FontLab.
Personally, I have all three applications (RoboFont, Glyphs, and FontLab). My problem is that everything I have in process was begun in FontLab and I have had difficulty switching over without spending my time learning the new ones instead of finishing what I have on the front burner now. I will begin my next "from scratch" font with RoboFont to give it a shot [I too am sick of the slow pace in bug fixes--notice I say bug fixes and not "new features" because new features just bring new bugs].

As to your question?  I don't know what other people use.  Perhaps you could post it as a survey question on Typophile and see?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have been using RoboFont over the summer and plan to continue using it. FontLab is still part of my toolbox, and probably will stay there. I haven't made anything from start to finish in it yet, and I definitely don't feel as fluent with it as I am with FontLab yet. But it also took some time to get accustomed to FontLab.

Seems to me that RoboFont's biggest fans are developers who are big users of UFO and Python, and who want total control over their workflow (as opposed to a workflow that's dictated by the font editor). It fits right in with the other existing UFO-centered tools better than FontLab. Plus, you can endlessly customize it using Python, and this is a big part of its appeal. Out of the box, it's not as capable as FontLab, but it's not meant to be. It's intended as a glyph editing and drawing component of a larger set of tools. So, comparing it to FontLab is a bit of apples and oranges.</div>

My main problem is in taking a FontLab file over to RoboFont.  I have succeeded in making a UFO after stripping all the apostrophe marks out of the classes.  My problem is that RoboFont balks at the code written by FontLab and me.  I can output a font error free in FontLab but RoboFont has an error message for several lines of code--mostly, it can't find the class definitions to look up even though I can see them in RoboFont.  I am trying to figure out how and where to paste the code text from FEA & FLC files to make RoboFont happy. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Have you tried asking on the RoboFont forum?

I would add that RoboFont and the whole world of UFO-based tools assume a fair amount of knowledge about how OpenType fonts are built (particularly using the AFDKO), in a way that FontLab doesn't. 

It's a bit more low-level in a lot of ways. FontLab tends to try to hide a lot of this detail as part of making an all-in-one solution. Glyphs is similar in this regard. 

I would also say that the documentation could be better. Something like either the FontLab manual or Leslie Cabarga's <em>Learn FontLab Fast</em> that gives why's and how to's of using RoboFont/UFO workflow, rather than just the what's of the existing documentation, would be a big help. There is almost a "you're smart, you should be able to figure it out" attitude, if I'm not reading too much into it.</div>

That can make sense in a brutal "survival of the fittest" sort of way, but the problem is it tends to exclude people who are smart enough, but also very busy: they can only afford to pick up a new tool if somebody helps them hit the ground running. It's not gracious -and in the big picture not fruitful- to exclude them.

True, I like to know what is under the hood, mostly so I can figure out problems on my own and not be held hostage to slow bug fixes.

I would be happy to do my coding in a text editor, and usually do.  I also find a spreadsheet ap very handy to keep track of classes, search&replace,  and refine sort orders.] I would like to know how to insert class text into the RoboFont file.  Simple clues like "paste here" would do just fine.  Better would be an "Import Classes" and "Import Features file".
I can see where to paste feature code but not "Classes" as a text file.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, well that's a simple answer: Paste them into the beginning of your feature code. (Actually, they can go anywhere as long as they precede the features that use them.)

I actually don't put my feature code directly into my font editor (either FontLab or RoboFont). Instead I do this:

<code>include (features.fea)</code>

...where <code>features.fea</code> is a text file (containing all my feature code) in the same directory as my font source file (.vfb or .ufo). I use TextMate or BBEdit to edit the code. Once it's saved, I can test the features in the font editor just as if I had typed them into my font editor. 

This has two big advantages: Better code editing tools (like code completion and complex search and replace) and the ability to share the same feature code across a family of fonts.

You can use <code>include</code> multiple times for multiple files if you need to break things up more or have exceptions that don't apply to every member of a font family (like maybe all style don't have small caps). You can also use <code>include</code> in a <code>.fea</code> file if you want (though this tends to just make things more complex).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, no, Chris. The format of the .flc file is unique to FontLab. Nothing to do with feature file syntax.

What you want is the "Save features…" command in the little pop-up menu on the top left corner of the OpenType panel. This will export everything in feature file syntax, including the kerning classes and kern feature. 

Note: Confusingly, RoboFont puts all your classes into its Groups feature. However, groups in RoboFont are not used by OpenType features. I'm not sure what they are good for. In any case, there is a RoboFont extension I would recommend called Groups2Features that does finish the job, allowing you to move any of your classes from groups into your feature code. I would also recommend the FeaturePreview extension.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I totally sympathize with the tenor here. We at FontLab tremendously respect our user community, and have been working hard. 

However, the fact is: the current codebase of FontLab Studio was written on Windows and was then ported to Mac OS 9, then to PowerPC Carbon on Mac OS X, and then to Intel Carbon on Mac OS X. It's like a wardrobe that you kept dismantling and reassembling three or four times, each time you move. The fourth iteration will squeak and wobble no matter what you do. We've had three full-time developers working primarily on stability of FontLab Studio 5.1 for over a year now, and you can see the results. They are, well... (Please note that, despite the fact that it was three man-years of development, we decided to release FontLab Studio 5.1 for free to all existing users.)

This only confirms the decision we made three years ago to build up a completely new codebase from scratch (Victoria). Since then, a second team of three developers has been working on this under the greater-than-ever Yuri Yarmola. 

*Finally*, at ATypI Hong Kong (next week) we'll be showing the first application based on the Victoria technology. 

It won't be the new FontLab Studio this time, but let me just say that it opens 200 UFOs in under 25 seconds total, is very stable and I think many of you will like it a lot, whether you're on FontLab Studio, Fontographer, Glyphs, RoboFont or FontForge. 

For the first time ever, we won't have to deal with a huge effort of porting code between Mac and Windows (we can release applications for both platforms practically from the same core), so we can concentrate on the *relevant things*, not on aligning some stupid dialog boxes and making sure that copy-paste of text doesn't crash the application. 

It took Adobe many years to develop InDesign 1.0 because they could not develop PageMaker any further. It took Apple many years to develop Mac OS X 10.0 because they could not develop Mac OS 9 any further. They needed fundamental change. 

And yes, some people actually moved away from Mac OS 9 to Windows in that process. Some switched back over to Mac OS X. And quite a few switched to Mac OS X from Windows even though they had never used a Mac before. 

However: in both Apple's and Adobe's cases, people were frustrated because it took the companies so long, and the very initial releases of the products were also frustrating to some. 

Yet, if you use InDesign on Mac OS X now, and perhaps think back to PageMaker on Mac OS 9, I'm not sure you would want to ever go back. 

So, as for FontLab Studio: there will be one more version of FontLab Studio 5.x for both Mac and Windows available this year. It will be maintenance release with a few potentially useful features. 

A brand-new font editor will follow, based on Victoria. Some 60-70% of the new editor are ready, but there are still some major parts missing. It will be free of all those frustrating limitations we had to live with for the last 5-10 years which were part of FontLab Studio. I might even say, it'll be free of quite a few frustrating limitations that any type designer had to live with, regardless of the tools they use. 

It certainly won't be the old shit. It'll be a fundamental change. 

Perhaps it'll be new shit. You'll be the judge. But I cannot say "available now" just yet — sorry. 

I've been on this bumpy ride of Victoria development for three years now. It's been the busiest and the most exciting time since I joined FontLab. To me, and people who have seen it, the results are absolutely breathtaking. 

So, prepare yourselves to join the last bit of the bumpy ride in 2013. Don't hold your breath quite now, save that for later. But please keep your fingers crossed for us. 

By all means, if FontLab Studio 5.x is causing you pain, use Glyphs or RoboFont until then. Since the Victoria-based font editor will be an entirely new product anyway, we'll need to win over the users of existing apps to switch — be it our own or someone else's apps. 

Did I say 2013? Yes, I did say 2013. And we mean it. 

Best regards,
Adam

Adam, how about you give everyone your personal phone number, so you can field all if the calls from people who are fed up with your smoke-up-the-ass song and dance routine. Enough irate calls might incentivize you to actually fix these stupid problems. ASAP, or in 2013. Really. No shit.

I presume that this comment is directed toward me; perhaps I flatter myself. However, I do not think it unreasonable to expect that a product which carries a premium price <strong>actually</strong> to work, or that promises made be <strong>actually</strong> fulfilled. Silly me.</div>

yes, that's right. We won't be releasing a new major upgrade of FontLab Studio based on the old codebase. Maintaining it has become increasingly complex. 

The new font editor we're working on, which we'd like to release in 2013, won't be a direct continuation of the current FontLab Studio as we know it today. 

Of course we will be offering discounted pricing for all existing users of FontLab Studio (and for users of other our products accordingly) -- just as we had offered discounted pricing in the past for, say, users of Fontographer who'd like to purchase FontLab Studio.

We think that for some time, users will find it useful to have both products. It's likely that some of the "font tech trickery" features which are part of the current FLS won't be included in the new product. 

I'm excited to say that we've shown an early preview of our new font editor at ATypI in Hong Kong last week, both publicly and, in more depth, privately to some respected type designers, and they reacted very positively to what they have seen. 

This gives us strength to continue our efforts to create the best tool for type design on the market. Many thanks for your continued support! 

Best,
Adam

A key one for me (and I know others here have mentioned it) was the app (5.1.2) crashing as I edited glyphs, which happened on a fairly regular basis. This has so far not happened with the 5.1.3 build.

Without knowing more about the new product (though I would very much like to be involved in beta testing, if and when that is opened up) it would be nice to see the FontLab tool maintained in some way; perhaps broken down into components or depending on the success of the new product, with a version released into the wild for others to tinker with?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Robofont is great. But one major issue with it now is that it is conceived as a glyph editor and doesn't provide tools for hinting. You can autohint with the AFDKO on generating a OTF, or with ttfautohint if you're doing TrueType, and that's basically it. I have a few few fonts with PS links in FontLab. In Robofont I will just loose this information and have to rely on what a tool is doing automatically. With the demand for webfonts, this is not enough. So just for that, FontLab is still a major, functional and advanced tool.

The great strength of Robofont is the UFO workflow and community. While robofont has nothing for hinting, you ***could*** build your own tool for it (or for whatever else), and attach it to Robofont as a plugin or as an external tool like MetricsMachine. That is already happening with RoboHint: http://vimeo.com/38350058

As far as FontLab goes, sure last years have been annoying as hell. And surely when you pay for a product you expect it to work well. But as font makers, don't we also experience the difficulty of producing software that has to work in different environnements over a long period of time? Sometimes you get requests and just can't answer them in a timely matter because you have to finish a project or find out what is causing that problem. Would you really like your customers to treat you like an idiot because kerning is suddently not working in Word after they updated their computers?

Beating on the FontLab guys relentlessly just shows a lack of respect and understanding.

(And I have my share of unanswered questions/requests on the FontLab forum)

Now it would be great to get an answer there: http://typophile.com/node/36474?page=1

Speaking on your earlier post, I'm curious what you meant by "font tech trickery"? My current workflow is Fontlab, RMX Tools, Prepolator, Superpolator and UFO Stretch. I have no interest in trying the new programs on the market as I have no real qualms with my current workflow, I only imagine that it'd be much nicer if all the separate programs I just listed were merged into one program.

The new version of FontLab in 2013 won't have all the same features as the current version? What major features are being omitted?</div>

Them's a whole lotta tools; I've gotten by with Fontographer, FontLab and MS Font Validater for years—but, then, I'm a hack with 0ver 1,100 fonts to my name.

What would be really cool would be an INTELLIGENT Bold function—one with tunable parameters to solve the S/8 pariah…</div>

well, it's difficult to explain. Most functionalities have a different approach. For example, we have unlimited layers which includes any numbers of outlines and bitmaps (color, grayscale or b/w). Glyph design and spacing happens in one unified window, which supports any OpenType features including Indic and Arabic shaping. The "blind" implementation of Multiple Master is replaced by a very different approach to interpolation across different masters. Character sets, encodings, codepages are seriously revamped. Etc. etc. 

All this has serious implications to the workflow. I think you're right to assume that quite a few of functionalities that you've mentioned will be unified in the new app.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, I have noticed that in version 5.1.3 using the Macro Toolbar, the 'Top level' drop down doesn't change to reflect any of the selections. For instance, if I select from the Top level drop down 'RoboFabUFO', it will still read as 'Top level', or any other selection it gets stuck on. 

It doesn't seem to effect the functionality, as the second level drop down reflects each selection and the Macros still work. (even though RoboFab seems to be broken a bit with this new version of 5.1.3) The only way to get the Top level drop down to reflect the selection name is to 'Reset macro' after making a selection.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it DID take Adobe many years to develop InDesign 1.0, and it was an unmitigated piece of crap; it screwed up font handling so bad that I had to uninstall, then reinstall Acrobat, Illustrator AND Photoshop. From the serious ass-smoking that Adam is laying down, I suppose that we can expect a similarly auspicious launch of Victoria. Whoop-tee-freaking-doo.

BTW, I stall haven't heard anything about DTL Kernmaster 2012; wasn't that due out months ago?</div>
