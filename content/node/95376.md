  body: "Hi Rashid.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting again in a new thread. It is hard to
    advice when I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done in the past, so I assume you
    are a beginner. \r\n\r\nStarting from scratch, I\u2019d try to figure out what
    tools the calligrapher used, get hold of one, and try your own hands at calligraphy.
    That will teach you how direction, pressure, angle, speed and all the other factors
    affect the outcome. Pay attention to thins and thicks, terminals, verticals, horisontals
    etc. The second step is learning how to draw Bezier curves with extrema points.
    The third step would probably be scanning and digiziting the calligraphy samples
    in a vector drawing application like Illustrator, or ideally directly in a font
    drawing application like Fontlab. Now it starts to become very apparent that letters
    are not only black, but also white: white inside letterforms and white between
    letterforms. These areas should harmonize with each other as well as with the
    black. Therefore, step four is studying spacing. Step five is optical adjustments.
    Why does the /O/ go above and below the /H/? Why is blacks in /g/ thinner than
    the blacks in /o/? Why is a bold taller at the x-height than a regular? Why is
    the /u/ narrower than the /n/? And so on and so on.\r\n\r\nThat should take you
    a couple of years. Come back when you\u2019re done, and I\u2019ll explain the
    rest :)"

  body: "Thank u Frode Frank for your detailed answer.\r\nI am a Civil Engineer by
    profession and Calligrapher and researcher of Arabic Calligraphy for about 3 decade.
    I have written two books on this subject.The detail is available at:\r\nwww.openlibrary.com/Authors/Muhammad
    Rashid Shaikh\r\n\r\nNow come to the point.\r\nI have deeply studied all font
    developed uptill now and I think that none of them possess beutie of Nastaleeq
    Calligraphy. The main reason is that almost all of the font developers do not
    have ample knowledge of Calligraphy.I have books written by a famous Calligrapher
    but they are in Litho not Offset. Now my proposed line of action is as follows.
    Please inform if there is some output from your side\r\n1. First of all the program
    will be character based. If the outcome is not as beautiful as required then it
    will be ligature based.\r\n2.Scanning all Characters in and taking print out in
    large size.\r\n3.Tracing the Characters very very carefully.\r\n4.Scanning the
    tracing papers.\r\n4.Checking minute details by scanning in Adobe Illustrator.
    If some modification is required then doing at this stage.\r\n5.Glyph preparation
    \r\n6.Programming using MS-Volt.\r\n\r\nNow please inform about these steps.\r\n\r\nRashid

  body: "Nastleeq is fairly complex than avarage Arabic fonts (or rather OpenType
    does not lend itself to that kind of sophistication), so my advice is to start
    by studying and mastering basic Arabic OpenType techniques, before moving to more
    sophisticated ones.\r\n\r\nCRULP have a nice [[http://www.crulp.org/software/localization/Fonts/nafeesNastaleeq.html|Nastaleeq
    font]], together with the Volt project (and a license that allows free use and
    modification), you may want to study it for advanced OpenType techniques used
    to build high quality Nastaleeq fonts.\r\n\r\nThe font has its issue though, it
    lacks many Arabic letters not used in Urdu, and the vowel marks positioning is
    completely broken, and has no support for kashida. I started a [[https://github.com/khaledhosny/hussaini-nastaleeq|derived
    project]] to address the first two issues, and I hope to add kashida support along
    the way of learning more about Nastaleeq and OpenType.\r\n\r\nAs for your points,
    1-5 are the easy ones and does not differ greatly from the way regular fonts are
    designed. Step 6 is where all the complexity and steep learning curve. I never
    used Volt, I usually use FontForge, but for such a project I'd write the substitution
    code in Adobe feature files (and compile it in with FontForge, but most people
    will use AFDKO)."

  body: "Dear Khaled Hosny\r\n\r\nThank u for your comment and writing about new font.Actually
    I know very well about Nafees Nastaleeq and font developed. I had close association
    with Syed Nafees ul Husaini who was one of the towering Calligraphers of Pakistan.
    Truly speaking Nafees Nastaleeq does not have beauties of Nasteleeq script. The
    main reason is that words made by glyphs are not same like words written by an
    expert Calligrapher. The joining of letters by Calligrapher is as per rules and
    finally very beautiful whreas joining by glyphs is not as beautiful. In my view
    the possible solution is developing a font on ligature based not character based.
    In this way all joining of letters will be same as done by expert Calligrapher.\r\nPlease
    inform your expert opinion about it\r\n\r\nRashi Shaikh"

  body: "A ligature based font will require tens of thousands of glyphs (18,000 according
    to http://www.crulp.org/software/ling_resources/UrduLigatures.htm), so it will
    take some effort to draw them all.\r\n\r\nBut a ligature based font would be easier
    to implement on the OpenType side, as it makes certain things simpler e.g. you
    have total control on dot positioning without the need of complex substitution
    rules, control over vowel positioning might be easier too (but I had some bad
    experience with mark positioning over ligatures in the bast, it is one of the
    reasons I maintain a ligature-free policy for all my fonts), and it would work
    even with most simple-minded OpenType implementations (where is fonts like Nafees
    Nstaleeq require the most sophisticated ones).\r\n\r\nBut if you have to draw
    every ligature for every possible combination of members of a letter group the
    number of glyphs might be much higher e.g. if you have a \u0628\u064A ligature,
    and given that Arabic and Urdu have 12 Baa-like letters in the initial form and
    4 Yaa-like letters in the final form, you have a total of 48 ligatures for every
    possible combination, while Nafees Nastaleeq has only 2 glyphs etc. Some of these
    combinations might not be valid in Urdu e.g. \u0649\u0649 so you may just choose
    to support only valid combinations but if some day someone invents a word that
    uses such combination e.g. in transliteration a foreign name, your font will give
    suboptimal and inconsistent result, but, depends on your goals, this may be an
    acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\nI think Monotype built a Nastaleeq font that way."

  body: "Dear Khaled Hosney\r\nThank u very much for your reply. Actually my main
    point of thinking is to develop a font having full beauties of Nastaleeq script.
    NOne of available Urdu fonts possess these beauties . As per my knowledge this
    font can be developed as ligature based because all ligatures will contain same
    joining beauties of characters as written by Calligrapher. But I will not stress
    on ligature based if someone will help me and inform how character based font
    will have same beauties of script as written by a Calligrapher.\r\nPlease see

  body: "I suggest instead of further asking you should test fontlab also. If you
    have the practical knowledge of font creator then it will not be difficult for
    you. I have not used font creator so do not know much about it. Also there is
    much material about fontlab that you can easily find on web. In fontlab you can
    also copy and paste directly from illustrator. It is one of the most wide spread
    font tool used by top type designers but it has some limitation. \r\n\r\nIt allows
    maximum 6399 glyphs per file or per font. Looking at your ambitions it will not
    fulfill your need as 6399 is very small number of glyphs for a ligature based
    Nastaleeq font that may contain much large number of glyphs. In this case you
    may try Asia Font Studio that support up to 65,535 glyphs per file. It has almost
    same interface and same functions as Fontlab Studio so if you get satisfied with
    fontlab then you may start work in Asia Font Studio.\r\n\r\nIn short, you have
    to test these software by yourself to find out which one is easy for you and which
    one gives best output outlines in a font. "

  body: "I think you need to experiment with different tools and work out what approach
    will be most comfortable for you. I use FontLab for most of my design work, using
    its drawing tools which are similar to Illustrator but with some differences.
    Most font tools have drawing tools like these, and most have free trial versions
    that you could download and test.\r\n\r\nFor the spreadsheet, you would start
    with a list of unique glyph names. If you want the names to be parseable by Adobe
    Acrobat, so that it can reconstruct text strings from PDFs distilled from printer
    streams, then you probably want two different sets of names: one set of easily
    understood development names such as 'aReh.fina' and one set of parseable names
    in the format 'uni0631.fina' (in accordance with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html\">Adobe's
    glyph naming rules</a>). I can't really provide an example, because the whole
    point of the spreadsheet is to organise the font planning in a way that makes
    most sense to you. So whatever information about glyphs you think would be helpful
    can all be collected in one place.\r\n\r\nYou might find this workflow document
    helpful:\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/FontLab-to-VOLTworkflow.pdf\r\n\r\n[UPDATE:
    corrected that link]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that you are setting out to do something
    very ambitious without a lot of experience of the basics of font creation, which
    is a pretty technical job. I suggest you try to break down your learning into
    steps, and start by familiarising yourself with what the different tool options
    are, explore how they work, and decide which suits you best (while at the same
    time confirming that it will be able to do everything that you need it to do in
    order to make the kind of font you have in mind)."
