body: "I\u2019m in the process of redoing a fairly experimental typeface I did around
  a decade ago called [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_roice_ot/|Roice]].\r\n\r\nThe
  new version will probably be called NuRoSlab (NuRo being short for New Roice) and
  it aims to be a version of Roice for the real world, meaning, among other things,
  that it\u2019s a lot less experimental.\r\n\r\nRight now I\u2019m testing it as
  a webfont on my [[www.alexscholing.nl|website]]. Let me know what you think.\r\nCheers,
  Alex\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alxstest_5716.jpg]"
