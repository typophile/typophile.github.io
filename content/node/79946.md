  body: The iPad and an e-book reader by Moon allow one to choose from a short menu
    of font styles, but otherwise all one can do is adjust the size of the typefaces
    built into the book by the publisher on nearly all E-book readers.

  body: Richard is correct, but taking this a step further you'd want a browser that
    makes it easy to over-ride author's font choices on a platform that allows you
    to install you're own fonts - one of those quaint old fashioned devices... a Mac
    or PC.

  body: "That is all very well, but since some people insist on having something portable
    for reading e-books, it's still helpful to recommend to them that they buy the
    one with the ability to install one's own fonts - if one's goal is to encourage
    the whole world to use modified versions of fonts that help them to avoid... negative
    thoughts.\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't think Adobe Reader lets me change the font
    on most .pdf documents, and so the choice of e-book <em>format</em> has a significant
    effect as well."
