  in either Type 1 or TrueType format. So all you have to do is make sure the font
  conversion program you use doesn't automatically convert the glyphs to TrueType
  format during the conversion.  Fontlab's font converter, TransType Pro, will even
  add some OpenType features during conversion if the appropriate glyphs are present.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards\r\nElvish Holic"

    \r\n\r\nBTW TransType is a good solution for that specific problem."

    the perfect place. But it should either be a real recommendation by actual users
    of the product or a real advertising from FontLab, which they could have posted
    in the blog section. \r\nBut this kind of hidden spam, planted here to show up
    in search engines and fool people that this is a real FontLab user talking is
    just terrible. \r\n(And it is bad advertising for FontLab and Typophile as well,
    if things like that are not taken care of.)"
