  body: "Sorry, I have to ask a stupid question, how old is the memorial? There may
    not be a digital version available. The R and T remind me of a De Vinne, but De
    Vinne is a updated version of an older font the name of which escapes me. And,
    there are a lot of De Vinne spinoff available. \r\n\r\nIf worst comes to worst,
    if you send me enough samples, I can build it for you.\r\n\r\nJames Stirling"
