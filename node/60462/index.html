  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a logo I designed a few months back that I&rsquo;m now revisiting. The mark is based on an abstracted coffee grinder, and the name refers to the idea of fusing coffees from different countries and cultures together to create unique blends. His coffee is also fantastic :)</p>
<p>I liked the type at the time but the &ldquo;n&rdquo; at the end of fusion now really bothers me, I&rsquo;m leaning towards just making that top line all uppercase. The distressed look is in line with the look we&rsquo;re developing for the brand, you can see the site (just launched a week or two ago) at <a href="http://www.fusionbeans.com/">http://www.fusionbeans.com/</a> We&rsquo;re also going to do a letterpress business card which I&rsquo;m pretty excited about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love some feedback on the mark, type, or any other thoughts/ideas. Thanks!</p>

<p>Maybe take the &lsquo;u&rsquo;, flip it and use that as an &lsquo;n&rsquo;. Or just cut off the bottom right serif. (I would only recommend this type of thing for logotypes)</p>
<p>I would decrease the size of &lsquo;beans&rsquo; to align in between the &lsquo;u&rsquo; and &lsquo;o&rsquo;. Right now they&rsquo;re kinda competing and more contrast is needed. I don&rsquo;t know if I like the mark or not&hellip;</p>
<p>Besides that, I can definitely see this brand having a nice distressed/rough but elegant script face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In my opinion, if you want to retain some of the feel of the present logotype, instead of going uppercase, I would try something with a unicase look.
Otherwise, I would try a completely different typeface (stencil comes to mind).
As for the mark, it feels to me a little too industrial (or something related to the sun).
Maybe you could accentuate the spiral shape (like streams of beans fusing together but also like the coffee’s aroma diffusing).</div>

<p>riccard, I actually like the mark for that reason, since &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; does have a bit of a sun/nuclear reference to it. It&rsquo;s also gone over well industry-wise, other roasters and baristas that have seen the site or the interim card (attached below) have commented on the grinder reference. I&rsquo;m ok with it looking a bit industrial as well since we&rsquo;re going for that sort of worn/textured look. Appreciate the thought though, and I&rsquo;m not opposed to other typefaces so I&rsquo;ll check out some options, thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, glad you like. We did a quick cheap run of the cards with an online printer so the client would have something to hand out to promote the new site, we&rsquo;re now debating getting a nice 4-color run done somewhere vs doing a cool letterpress card on some recycled looking stock (as I think the logo would look really great letterpressed, however it turns out in the end). Thoughts? Here&rsquo;s the front and back as currently printed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/fusion_card_6433.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Any ideas are appreciated as the print side of things isn&rsquo;t my forte. Thanks!</p>

<p>In fact, if I get in “designer nitpicking mode”, the whole type bothers me; alignment, lowercase/uppercase mixing, different size mixing (and hence, different stroke widths), kerning (mixing uppercase with lowercase makes that a bit harder) and even some of the details on some of the letters.</p>
<p>But if I relax, I&rsquo;d say I really like the whole thing. The looks and feel of it are pretty nice (although not necessarily innovative, but I&rsquo;m not nitpicking, now) and it kind of makes me want to taste that coffee. And I don&rsquo;t drink coffee. And of course, that symbol rocks.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if moving that onto the side with the rest of the info is a good move, either aesthetically or practically, but you might consider trying it. (aesthetically&ndash;i might benefit the right side, but might detract from the left by having too much information, practically&ndash;is it a good thing or a bad thing to have information on both sides).</p>
<p>or it could be that there is a circle in the coffee above the website, that subtle, sensual curve&ndash;and the straight baseline of the type just goes against that.</p>
<p>if it were to stay on that straight baseline, i might try just putting it back to a pure horizontal and moving it more towards the bottom right, a little further away from that circle.</p>

<p>ruben, if it makes you want to taste the coffee (especially as a non-coffee drinker) I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s done its job :) I agree on the type issues though, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m noticing now after revisiting it. I&rsquo;m going to work on some alternate versions this weekend without the case mixing and with some adjusted kerning/spacing and see what it comes out like.</p>
<p>evan, good point on the web address. If we go the letterpress route we&rsquo;ll definitely be moving all the info onto one side (and would most likely lose the background image) and I probably would move all the type to a pure horizontal. If that&rsquo;s the case, does the logo still work misaligned or should it rotate to the 90 as well? Just thinking out loud&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a look at moving the web adress onto the front of the card as is and play with the alignment there as well, if we were to just print that one sided 4-color we could probably afford to do a cool emboss/deboss of the logo on some nice recycled-looking stock.</p>

<p>A difficult balance - when i look at it - part of me thinks its enough part of me thinks it needs rotating a tiny bit more to get away from the mis printed look.</p>

Which is far enough to make a difference, but not to far to looked forced, and it definitely doesn&rsquo;t look mis-printed a -1 or -2 degree would do that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, some type tweaking, sized down &ldquo;beans&rdquo; a bit and tried &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; in all caps. I feel like the all caps loses a bit of it&rsquo;s uniqueness as compared to the original &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t dislike it.</p>
<p>Also, I looked at tucking in &ldquo;beans&rdquo; between the U and O as suggested but that brings the type off-center in relation to the mark. I tried just bringing that B in line with the U to help that alignment.</p>
<p>Thoughts on either?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, after a few distractions I&rsquo;ve revisited this, here&rsquo;s a mockup of a one-sided version of the card with the slightly revised mark (probably going to darken the mark a bit). I think this&rsquo;ll work, but I&rsquo;m currently debating on print options.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking possibly printing this 4 color on a nice recycled sort of stock and then embossing/debossing the logo. Another option would be to do a simpler version (without the background) and letterpressing the design. thoughts from you more experienced print types?</p>

<p>Is there going to be a white square on the bag where all the info goes (eg: roast, blend, etc.)? Take a picture of the bag and put the card next to it to see how close they are. I&rsquo;m not quite sure if I understand the bottom crease on the card and what part of the bag it&rsquo;s representing.</p>
<p>Have you thought about printing on actual mini bags? If you did that, then into each bag (or card) you could insert a few roasted beans which would give it the smell of fresh coffee. Or maybe you could ask the printer to mix some coffee beans into the ink :)</p>

<p>penn, the idea with the bottom crease was to be that point where the bag folds to be flat bottomed. I think Ratbaggy may be onto something though, I&rsquo;m looking into what the options are for purchasing small paper bags&hellip;</p>
