  the nineteenth century, especially evolutionary anthropology, archaeology and the
  like - would anyone care to recommend a typeface that would simulate (or indeed,
  parody) the objectivist discourse of the period? \r\n\r\nMy thoughts turned immediately
  to Didot, Bodoni, etc. (given the modernism-cum-romanticism of many anthropologists)
  but I then wondered if there was a more distinctively 'scientific' (authoritative,
  objective) face in use throughout the 19th century? \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would
  be appreciated. Thanks. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'The apocryphal story goes that slab serifs are called Egyptian/Egyptienne
    because dispatches from Napoleon''s expeditions into Egypt were set using them
    (the dates don''t quite align right?), or else some sort of book published later
    on the subject used them. If anyone less hazy on the subject than me can substantiate
    this, it would be an interesting connection to explore. Things don''t get much
    more colonial than Napoleon in Egypt, and it was also when the Rosetta stone was
    found, if I''m not mistaken. '

    Anyway, history is one thing, current perceptions another, and I don't think slabs
    say colonial to most people. On the other hand, I do agree that conveying colonialism,
    especially a parody of it, would do best to look towards France.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: All the nineteenth-century archaeology books (either original or facsmile
    reprint) that I have are set in moderns of one sort or another, the Anglophone
    ones being generally more or less Scotch in appearance and the Italian ones more
    Bodoni-ish. In the late nineteenth century US, in the heyday of cultural evolutionism,
    you get faces that look very much like Monotype Modern Extended (some sort of
    Linotype equivalent, I suppose?), and then around the turn of the century some
    Century-ish faces also.

  body: Thanks for all of the different (and intriguing) perspectives, there's much
    to consider. At the moment, MTScotchRoman seems to suit the content of the project
    perfectly (a rejoinder to anthropological discourse, almost a broadside, rather
    than an academic monograph or formal treatise on the subject). I'm drawn to Modern
    Extended (and Condensed as well!) but simply adore the weighty uppercase and kerning
    idiosyncracies of MTScotchRoman. The alternative approach would be to use a thoroughly
    contemporary font (it's an essay on postcolonialism, after all), but I'll work
    with ScotchRoman for now, see what comes to fruition. Thanks everybody for your
    respective two cents' worth - which has already proven invaluable!

  body: "To my eye, what you see as \"kerning idiosyncracies\" in Monotype Scotch
    Roman is really just lousy letterfitting. & the \"weighty uppercase\" just throws
    spots of discordant color into your line. This was true in the metal face and
    only got worse in subsequent versions.\r\n\r\nYou are on the right track to think
    of Scotch, and I'll let you get away with MT Scotch for this quasi-broadside,
    but if you do a book-length project and want to use Scotch, for heaven's sake,
    use a decent version of it. Miller is the only choice whenever I need to use Scotch
    Roman. Check that out. But use that alternate R.\r\n\r\npowers"

    the version I have doesn't include an italic, which is inherent to the form of

    body: "Indeed, hand comps were inserting wide spacing after periods long before
      typewriters came into general use. At least that was the practice in the USA,
      and I think in Britain. I'm not sure what the overall history of the practice
      is. I looked at three books this morning from different times & places.\r\n\r\nA
      small volume of Horace printed by Ambroise Firmin Didot in Paris in 1855 shows
      no extra space after the periods. (It does show space added fore and aft of
      some punctuation, which has been discussed in a different thread here.)\r\n\r\n\"Sylvie,\"
      by Nerval, printed by William Bird Mosher in Portland, Maine in 1896 has spaces
      after periods into which one could park a Hummer. & generally crappy typesetting.\r\n\r\n\"ABCs
      of Book Collecting,\" London, 1952 has spaces less wide than the Nerval, but
      greater than the justifying spaces in its lines.\r\n\r\n**************\r\nSeeing
      the revival of Law Italic was a pleasant surprise; thanks, Hrant. This does
      make me believe Everything That Has Been Shall Be Again. I am constantly surprised,
      for instance, by the re-issue of obscure jazz LPs originally on small labels
      from 45 or so years ago. Thus it appears to be with typefaces also.\r\n\r\npowers"
