I am looking for definition(s) of, and reliable sources for the word 'ductus' (if possible with annotated images).

		<div class="commentbody">[I posted the following response on the ATypI e-mail list, but figured I'd repeat it here for the sake of future reference.]

I'm glad you asked this question, as I've seen the term used to describe different things in the context of typography, writing, letterform design, etc.

1) Some people use ductus to refer to the flaring or "reverse entasis" in the stokes of a letter.

2) I've also seen people use ductus to refer to the kind of meta-design of a letter – its basic underlying structure. For example, in this sense of the word, a single-storey g and a double-storey g represent the same character, but have a different ductus. Other people describe this kind of basic construction of a letter as its "topology", a term which I would be more inclined to use.

3) Finally, I've also seen ductus used as a parallel to how the term is used in the context of spoken language – to refer to the unique characteristics of flow, speed, direction, and tone of written text. In this sense of the word, it could be said that variations in ductus are what allow you to identify people by their handwriting.

With all that in mind, it seems that ductus is a commonly confused/confusing term, so one would be advised to use it cautiously. Especially because the varying interpretations are so closely related, it is easy to imagine a misunderstanding of any statements which use the term.</div>

Here at Typophile "ductus" usually seems to mean the pen angle implied by the stress of a face's chirographic elements, though there is the occasional focus on the imagined pen path when it is in question.</div>

Actually different tools each use different direction and sequence, and sometimes the ductus will change to achieve different results and accommodate the strengths/weaknesses of the tool and handler.

Typically not in the usage of the term by calligraphers, palaeographers and other writing experts. Ductus refers to the movements and their sequence. But the same ductus written with a different tool or the same tool held at a different angle results in a different style of writing.</div>

The three examples above—Brush, chisel & ruling pen are very cool. Great hand.

Is there any way to get that effect (ruling pen example) using software, or applying some type of filter in Illustrator?

I would love to simulate and apply that look to a script I'm designing.

Thanks in advance.

It looks as though they endeavored to never cross over in a stroke.  This kind of radial pivot is similar in some ways to some Greek I have seen but kind of backwards in stress to it.  The written Greek I have seen is not nearly so crisp, though.  Perhaps the Greeks were not as fond of the regular glyph or sub-glyph height. ;-)  
This sample shows a very chiseled sharp edge that makes a clean line.  That took some mighty skill to master! Now you have me hooked!  I have to dig into this and find more, now :-)

I used to watch my grandmother write with great wonderment because of her arm and wrist movement. She seemed to pivot about her elbow as if it were a moving compass for certain curved strokes but her elbow would jut out at a right angle for the bolder horizontal straights.  She would smile and say to me in a whisper, "Don't write with your fingers like your mother [her daughter] learned in American school."  Actually, watching για για cooking and rolling grape leaves had the same flourished, sure motions of the arm as in writing.  She may have talked with her hands, but wrote with her arms.

Thanks, John.  I just looked at Noordij again.  I see what you mean!

What might not have been evident from Michael’s response is that when using a ruling pen for this kind of calligraphy, it is manipulated in pretty much the exact opposite way from what it was designed for and how you’re accustomed to using it. ;-)

Instead of ruling in a direction parallel to the blades to get an even, consistent-width line, for lettering like this you generally run the broad edge of the blades against the paper and work more *against* the direction of the blades, dragging across the page. Varying the angle of the ruling pen in relation to the surface, more vertical or more shallow, will bring more or less blade surface in contact and yield variations in width. 

I don’t know how you held your ruling pen when drafting. I know many people held it with a more or less normal pen grip. But I believe most letterers use a grip more akin to how you would hold a steak knife. This allows a great range of whole-arm movement for angling and rotating.

(And I think most letterers grind down the tips of the blades, so they aren’t so sharp and won’t catch on the page.)

If the paper is cold pressed or rough, you get textured edge effects like in Michael’s “ruling pen” example. If the paper is smooth, you generally get cleaner edges, as in the “Scio me” example (the subtler edge effect there looks more like a result of absorbancy than surface texture).

Michael will correct me if I’ve made any errors in my description.</div>

My grip was a bit more like dart throwing but facing down. I always held my ruling pen perfectly vertical in the tips of my fingers with my pinky out as a brace on the parallel-edge.  Any angle other than vertical would cause line weight to vary and bad looking endings.
I will have to watch Michael in action some day--it might make me cringe though ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's right, Chris. Chirography is just a fancy Greek-derived word for handwriting. Calligraphy is a subcategory of chirography. The term chirography is useful because it obliges one to consider all the cultural aspects of literacy, not just calligraphy, which has different significance at different times and places. I'm interested in professional text production, for instance, which in scribal cultures involves copyists whose work is typically distinguished, in those cultures, from the work of calligraphers.</div>

Well, I don't know, you raise an interesting question. There is a certain discipline and restraint involved in good scribal hands, but some can be quite beautiful, and others not so much. Perhaps I should have said that the constraints on the scribe are more narrow, and the latitude for decoration more for the illuminator. Whatever the difference in the two skills or arts, there was enough of a difference that there were specialists in each area. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">First off Hrant... no one was trying to add or subtract meaning from ductus with the term modulation. Pure and simple ductus: direction and sequence. Modulation is just an additional factor... Arthur Baker, in his "illuminations," deals with the modulations/manipulations in the scribal traditions. Marc Drogin and countless others have also dealt with it. Secondly, no one was talking type, we were talking calligraphy! Derivations of calligraphy that end up in typographic form is a whole different bag of worms.

@ John. "copyists" seems almost pejorative to me... as "those copyists" had very high levels of facility. Maybe scribe would be more appropriate. Otherwise you end up with a human Xerox.

@ William... the division of labor in the manuscripts was not as simple as you make it. There were MANY involved in the production, all experts in different "talents.

See if there are any representations of Mira Calligraphiae Monumenta, Georg Bocskay/Joris Hoefnagel, on line and tell me Georg was a copyist. 1561 I think.</div>

I would imagine that just as in subsequent centuries, the work may have been divided any which way, contingent on circumstance.

I suspect that if an illuminator had created a title page with a small amount of text, he might have been inclined to do the whole page, including the text. 

Similarly, if a page only had one or two decorated initials, then the scribe churning out the body text may have also been allowed to take a crack at the initials.

This presupposes a model of apprenticeship in which one starts mixing ink as a young lad, progressing to doing plain old transcription, then to full-fledged gold-leaf pictorial representation. With a “masterpiece” required at each step along the way. So all illuminators would have been more than capable scribes.

And you have to wonder whether economic conditions would have been able to support a specialist illuminator at all times in all scriptoria, without having him also pitch in with more mundane scribeling.</div>

Yup. In fact many scribes were convicts who took shelter in the Church.
And a pretty lousy Xerox since mistakes were rife (and that's one reason

Read that some of the illuminators have been identified, and there are partially done MSS that reveal the production process, with the script first, with blank spaces planned for initials, illuminations. Initial sketches for illumination, etc. Hey I read it on the internet—has to be true, right :) </div>

Concerning modulation: what is the precise definition. I have looked it up in the dictionary, and have a vague idea of how it relates to letters, but what's the specifics? Is it just differences in thickness? Rotation of the pen? I mainly "sculpt" all my letters on the computer, so such a simple term is still not totally clear to me.</div>

In <em>type</em> I've seen two definitions:
- The differentiation of thick and thin parts of letters.
- The thinning of joints to counteract visual and/or mechanical "clotting".

		<div class="commentbody">Michael: <em>"copyists" seems almost pejorative to me... as "those copyists" had very high levels of facility. Maybe scribe would be more appropriate.</em>

I definitely don't mean copyist to be pejorative: it is simply descriptive of a particular job within a scribal culture. Scribe is a generic term that covers copyists, secretaries, anamuenses. Depending on the place, time and particular circumstances, the task of a copyist -- and the criteria by which his or her work is judged -- may involve producing a fair copy in a discretionary style, or it might involve producing a copy in a particular regional style that differs from the original, or it might involve producing a copy that reproduces the appearance of the original very closely. As you say, these copyists tended to have very high levels of facility, although I've also seen a lot of jobbing work that shows signs of haste.

My point is that scribal cultures involve various modes of text production which is doesn't make sense to lump into a single category as 'calligraphy' -- especially not when those cultures have their own classification of calligraphy that excludes most writing however high the facility of the scribe. Hence 'chirography'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Briän, modulation refers to the variation in the thickness of lines that make up a letter. A truly monoline letter, in which all the lines are the same thickness, would be the only kind without modulation. In practice, due to the needs of optical compensation, accounting for ink or other media factors, etc., even letters that try to appear monoline require modulation.

In writing, different tools and the varying ways in which they are used produce characteristic modulation patterns, i.e. characteristic arrangements of thinner and thicker lines and transitions between them. Since almost all typographies derive originally from written forms, there tend to be characteristic modulation patterns in typographic letters that echo written forms and, hence, particular tools. Hence, the renaissance roman and italic types have modulation patterns that echo contemporary humanist book and chancery hands as written with a broad nib pen held at a mostly consistent angle; 17th Century civilité types have modulation patterns that include features that echo rotation of the broad nib pen; and 18th and 19th Century neoclassical and romantic types have modulation patterns that echo the dynamism of the split steel nib found in contemporary writing.

Two things, at least, should be evident from this:

1. Making shapes using particular tools can produce numerous modulation patterns that might be echo'd in type, regardless of how the type itself is made (cut from steel, ‘sculpting’ on the computer screen as you put it);

2. The independent manufacture of type does not tie it to any one modulation pattern or to any particular writing technique or tool, or indeed, to any written model.

I would add to that the observation that modulation patterns derived from tool and technique produce internal consistency when applied across a range of shapes such as an alphabet, so provide a reliable means to avoid arbitrariness and distracting inconsistency. As Evert Bloemsma showed us, though, there are other methods to avoid arbitrariness. A good question for any type designer wishing to work with modulation patterns not echoing written forms to ask is this: why is Legato so good and so many of Fred Goudy's types not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I think you are right about Baskerville being close to the pointed pen writing, something where I was wrong in an earlier discussion. But I think Chris is right on this one. Bodoni is influenced by Baskerville, but in so far as it departs from it, it seems to be working from a different visual logic. For example, how the heck are you going to write that A which Chris shows, in continuous strokes?

Overall, I think Chris's above post on visual logic is very well put, and right on target.

It also relates to why I think your campaign against handwriting influences is misguided, Hrant. Some features of writing with the broad pen help readability, some hurt, and some are neutral. The classic old styles, beginning with Jenson, use a different visual logic, holding on to some pen features and abandoning others.

I agree entirely. For example "stroke" contrast helps, and it's
not something one would think of instinctively, it came out from
using an edged marking tool. The problem is, provenance aside,
<em>continuing to think</em> of chirography as an inescapably good
influence in type design makes no sense.

Yes, but this is only one kind of logic.  The prime example is pen logic.  Even in pen logic, there have been differences in how pens or other tools have been used.  Your recent Flemish example to me comes to mind.  The didones don't follow pen logic.  If anything, they are from a drafting tool logic (compass, straight edge, geometric figures,etc)

Many sans mostly, grotesques don't follow tool logic either, they are founded on optical corrections required after a geometric starting point.  They do follow a consistency pattern, however.

The important thing is that there be some kind of logic behind whatever the designer uses--even if it is a "grunge" logic.  Bloesma had his own way of seeing and it works quite well, in fact extremely well.  

I prefer to let the form tell me if it is working, not only by itself but when placed next to other forms.  To me, there is figure and there is ground.  Neither one is positive or negative or of lesser value . Both must live in some kind of harmony but the rules of harmony vary as much as they do in music.

You can use the logic of falling shadows in perspective or some purely mathematical progression be it Fibonacci  or simple arithmetic or any of your invention.  There is also fractal logic which is amazingly adaptive.

I guess there is a ton of possibilities that all fall under "visual logic".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill,
Continuous strokes [at least as  know them] are not required for pointed pen writing.  There is a lot of elbow contortion when writing in this style for right-handed scribes.  Lefties loved it though! The pen was lifted often at the bottom of the stem.  There was very little "build-up" of strokes in the written hand, though.  Pressure on the pen cause the nib to spread and the stroke to thicken.  The build up of thicks came at large sizes where no pen could ever spread enough to make that big of a line weight change.  
Engravers would scribe lines and reduce the fills by etching.  The development of fine steel for swords opened the world for engraving.  The quality of steel was hard enough to score copper, zinc, etc. with ease.  The steel compass with scoring blade was an engravers friend.  There was also quite a bit of bank stationary done on lithographic stones using this style of lettering.  Acid resistant touche was skillfully applied to lith stones and then given an acid bath--sufficient to make the lettering feel raised.  When I was in design school in print making class.  A bank printing firm donated hundreds of huge lith stones to Carnegie Mellon with the written text and filagree still firmly etched in place--no bearer bonds though ;-)  Our class moved the stones by hand from the dusty back room of the engravers shop and loaded them onto my room mates 1960 Volkswagon Micro-bus.  It took dozens of trips and many bashed fingers :-)</div>

want to elaborate my view and see what you (plural) think.

It ties in to the nice "arbitrary" that John used. To me that's
basically what chirography is in type. It might <em>seem</em> to enforce
a logic or certain consistency, but since it's a logic alien to the
functionality of type all it can do is distract. We should be using
"stroke" contrast in our text fonts, but not because of a happy
chirographic accident, but because it helps reading. By the same
token we should not use attributes of chirography just because we
used to read only handwriting hundreds of years ago, we should
only use them because they serve an identifiable purpose.

The hand brings a gift that the eye does not need.

No, I meant that "stroke" contrast for example is a chirographic happy accident.

and endorse serifs that have an adnate left side and an abrupt right side, at least
not until somebody gives me a reason beyond "it alludes to what the hand makes".

Looking at the letters you're making isn't reading.

Not superior in every way. But superior for what is expected of

In the absence of formal proof rationality remains.

To my mind the gift the metal and the beziers bring is <em>progressive</em>, positive, non-arbitrary norm-violation toward greater functionality, and norm-violation on norm-violation, to the 3rd and 4th generation, to the point where it looks like ductal logic is no longer even there.

Fitness of the products of the pen (writing) for reading becomes consolidated over time. 

We don't have reading hardware. We have object recognition circuitry, which is inherited. This circuitry becomes adapted for word recognition and reading during reading acquisition, but  basic object recognition principles persist. The eye needs certain things for fast and efficient word recognition so writing adapts. This process repeats itself in the writing of ever child who learns to write legibly. Read <em>Reading in the Brain</em>.

Writing is relevant because it brought the evolving script system of the Holy Roman Empire and it's satellite states to a certain plateau of functionality. Chiro-dogmatism isn't relevant. Remembering where we came from is.

We are still on the plateau. We and our also relevant, sometimes masterly, often well-motivated, presumably effective and hopefully progressive norm-violations. Norm-violations, and norm violations upon previous norm violations and so on, optimize performance on the plateau.</div>

Reading is a skill, so cannot be inherited. And if we agree
that evolution hasn't had the time to affect our reading
"hardware" then your position does not make sense.

Most type designers limit themselves by believing in the relevance
of chirography. The best type designers (like Bloemsma) know well
that it's simply a comforting illusion. Comforting because it seems
to give more meaning to our physical reality. But it's a succubus.

Hrant, from where I stand, I see that you want strong, bold, ambitious norm violations of contrast styling and construction schemes. Notan is your guiding star. Optimizing readability is your end-in-view. 

You think chirography is my guiding star. It isn't. I'm not a type designer. I use swept-object arithmetic as a touchstone to bring into view, from one, I think illuminating angle, what's going on in your forms, not to chastise you. It's a referential axis, a heuristic, not a goal. That's how I used it in my analysis of Raffia 8 years ago, and in my analysis of Legato more recently. Please don't discredit what I try to do.

You are impatient with norm-violational timidity, staying close to the shore.

I can go along with what, from my perspective, you seem to want to do. In fact, I applaud it. I really do! Go for it brother! Make the laboratory of notan your home. Make it a vital place. Get others to join you.

I think notan is an intensely relevant guiding star, if only because both the black and white are information for vision in foveal vision, and in parafoveal vision it's the notanic distibution that's critical. If a ductus is a path. Follow your ductus.

To some extent all competent designers are sensitive to Notan. At least, that's what I'm seeing.</div>

Right. Neural representation is feature-tolerant, also of <em>your</em> norm-violations. There is a plateau because of this.

But while neural representation is feature-tolerant, the <em>efficiency</em> of cortical integrational routines (for items in foveal vison), and informative [feature] ‘pooling’ (for parafoveal preview) benefits from rhythmic spacing, equivalent valence of the black and white, a consistent contrast scheme and strategic construction. 

The efficiency of cortical integrational routines within the visual cortex is one of the key components of optimal readability. Here is where the efficacy of adjustments to contrast and construction come in. Writing gave the eye a lot of what the visual cortex needs to run its cortical integrational routines efficiently.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, Bill, I think we're working with different understandings of 'pen logic' here (actually, it isn't a term I'm very happy with). I take as granted that type design when it relates to writing is, to use Peter Enneson's helpful word, parachirographic. I neither expect nor look for the pen to be able to create all the precise forms that I see in a typeface informed by the characteristics (logic) of that tool. Wht I see in the romantic types of Bodoni, Didot etc. is the extreme dynamics of the expansion stroke model as found in contemporary writing and, yes, engraving, but you should read the complaints of the 18th Century writing masters about how poorly most engravers reproduced their work (Bickham was the exception). The dynamics of these letters, their characteristic modulation pattern, the particular transitions between the hairlines and the curves: these are all derived from the characteristics of the split nib, parachirographically interpreted, as always, into the new medium of type. That medium, of course, suggests solutions of its own, some of which differ from those available to the scribe. I don't see a problem with acknowledging those differences while recognising the foundational reliance on the characteristics of the pen to establish the style.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John,

As I said, it is certainly apparent that Bodoni got the idea of strong contrast and quick modulation from pointed pen writing.  The problem I see is that this look is hardly a device dependent technique. Also, pointed pen writing surely has no where near the regularity, precision, and broad range of expansion as drafting techniques can produce.  The interpreation I get from what you said above is that the didone types were trying to mimic the written scripts and are forever bound to genuflect to pen in a subserviant way.

I can see your argument with Gutenberg and blackletter and italics to various nibbed hands.  The constant angle of pen dictates the stresses with them.  The pen held at the single proper angle will direct the shape of the curve.  With the pointed pen, the writer must skillfully apply the correct pressure undulations himself, The pen does not dictate the curves. The curves instead dictate the pen spread.  To me, this takes the tool out of the equation.  The pointed pens' logic is simply that greater pressure makes thicker strokes.  This puts the generation squarely in the hand of the writer and the tool just goes at his whim.  The pointed pen is a very difficult tool to master compared to a flat pen for this reason.  It gives you nothing. It fights you all the way.  The flat pen does much of the work for you and dictates form in and of itself.  Anyone can learn to write a somewhat acceptable looking roundhand quite quickly but the pointed pen is a stingy beast.

Was the pen an inspiration? Yes.  Did it dictate the form? No.  It cannot instill a logic that it does not have.  It is like a computer that forces you to do all the math in your head before it can generate a solution .

While I admit that the term "parachirographically interpreted," rings with authority [even has a sense of awe about it], creating a new term would just prompt arguments over its definition.  That seems pointless.  I don't care what you call it but pen logic certainly is much more clear a descriptive term.  It is possible to lock a flat pen at a constant angle into an off-center lathe and have it draw circles that resemble a flatpen written "O" with the only adjust being the pen touching the paper and then fixed.  With a pointed pen configured in the same way, yes, it will draw a fine circle but without constant manipulation of pressure and angle, it won't give you a didone looking"O".  It won't because it has no logic of its own. It is totally dependent on someone else to supply the needed adjustments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I can appreciate what you're saying, but the broad-pen did not dictate the curves either. The pen — and it’s angle — dictate only the stress and the contrast modulation. The curves have to do with the letter’s construction conventions. 

Writing with a broad-nibbed pen helped shape the way ductal conventions are applied. The pointed pen is parasitic on these conventions and also feeds off of broad-nibbed allocation of stress. For example, it starts the left side curve of the “o” (without applying pressure) where the broad-nibbed pen yields a thin section, and applies pressure as it moves along the curve, placing thicker parts where normal broad-pen usage places the thicks naturally.

I keep forgetting my term para-chirographic but like that John has found it useful. I still think it applies. It expresses that in type the didone forms don't necessarily follow pen-logic to the letter, but spin off the products of this logic with an understanding of where the forms come from. They spin off. But they stand beside. The historical dynamic is not one of servile imitation. <em>Para</em> is to stand beside.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I've never said that the tool dictates the form. The tool restricts some possibilities and encourages others. This is what it provides: a particular range of ways of making shapes, which will be explored by scribes in the development of particular styles, which will in turn inform the development of styles of typography within the same broader cultural framework (cf. Bringhurst on the relationship of the dynamics of Romantic type to the dynamics of Romantic music).

Again, I've never said that the tool dictates the form. What I've said, specifically in this thread on ductus, is that the modulation patterns of typographic letters tend to derive from those of writing, and that the tool is one factor that determines the characteristics that constitute individual styles of writing. Note what I wrote earlier: the same tool can be used with different ducti to produce different styles, and the same ductus can be written with different tools, also producing different styles. But the styles of mature scribal cultures -- as distinct from the personal handwriting style -- are conventional systems with strong pedagogical traditions (in the original sense of 'handed on'). The characteristic modulation patterns of Romantic types echo the modulation patterns of contemporary scribal culture (and bear in mind that this was almost the last period in which European culture was scribal; the debates we have today about what constitutes 'calligraphy' are, to my mind, only possible in a culture that has ceased to be scribal).</div>

"The Possibility of" is meaningless.  The whole point of a tools logic is what that tool provides by its nature, not by human intervention. A stone provides the possibility of being thrown accurately enough to hit an intended target.  The stone does not supply anything other than its mass to do the job. The likelihood of success hitting the target is quite small given only what the tool provides to enhance the odds of success. On the other hand, a rifle supplies the user with functions that make hitting a target accurately highly likely.

That completely supports my point!  If a calligrapher is using flat pen logic to draw a letter with a pointed pen, then he is using FLAT-pen logic.  If I use an airbrush using flat pen logic to draw a glyph, I am not using the airbrush with airbrush logic.  If I pound a nail with a glass vase, it is possible but not using glass vase logic--it is using hammer logic.
If I use a flat edged putty knife to draw letters in wet plaster, it is quite within the nature of the putty knife to do it with ease because it follows the same logic as the flat pen.</div>

And I'm saying that writing doesn't work that way. The scribe works with the tool, not in spite of it. Hence, the possibilities of the tool -- both what it makes possible and what it makes impossible -- are anything but 'meaningless'. They are a constituent factor of the resulting writing styles which is <em>proven</em> by the fact that the same ductus written with different tools produces different styles.

Nick, you can only make that claim re. the Roman du Roi if you completely ignore contemporary French formal writing. The geometry of the Roman du Roi plates is a rationalisation of what is already evident in writing. The Roman du Roi design doesn't introduce any modulation pattern innovation that is abstract or derived from geometry; rather, it tries to describe in geometric terms the organic letters created by scribes and type makers in their contemporary cultural guise. Durer and Tory et al had done the same thing with regard to capitalis monumentalis, fantasising that these were based on geometry -- all that radial serif bracketing! -- and missing the fact that they were based on the brush.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, Durer (who wrote the first book on maths published in German) believed that there was an underlying mathematical basis to the physical world. His fantasizing was visionary, as this is how scientists now address the "ultimate nature of reality".
His geometricization of letterforms was both descriptive, and prescriptive, or one might say predictive.
When he diagrammed the human face as a 3D polygonal map, he wasn't missing the fact that it was organic, but investigating structure.

The scientific body that created the Roman du Roi designs was, too, not merely describing contemporary letterforms, but seeking an ideal, and asserting that the ultimate structure of letters was abstract, in the sense that it was reducible to straight lines and arcs of circle, and mathematical, in the sense that it was drawn on graph squares with ruler and compass, and algebraic-looking notation along the axes (in the style of Durer). It was a scientific power-play, with science muscling in on a cultural activity, much as it does today with readability science.

The Enlightenment zeitgeist was shared across culture, with writing masters, engravers, punch cutters, etc., all pursuing similar formal ideals, informed by cross-pollination of the disciplines.The idea that the didone style of type originates with pen modulation is too narrow.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, yes, the Enlightenment zeitgeist was indeed shared across the culture, which is precisely why we should be cautious in accepting the claims of the period at face value. Periods of intense self-conscious progress tend to a number of propagandistic and rhetorical manoeuvres to distinquish themselves from what has come before and to proclaim their progressiveness and uniqueness. We see this not only in the Enlightenment but also in the Renaissance and, more recently, in Modernism. Rationalism, science and mathematics are at once real areas of progress in the 18th Century and rhetorical talking points by which that progress is inflated and made distinctive at the expense of those contributive elements inherited from longer, organic developments.

To me, it is more telling that the 'ideal' produced by the Roman du Roi committee reflects the forms of contemporary writing tools and scribal practices than it is that committee believed it was being scientific. It seems to me obvious that there is nothing intrinsically rational or scientific about these letterforms that could not be claimed for any other style of lettering plotted on graph squares, and equally obvious that if the exercise had been carried out at a different time and place, in the context of different contemporary writing conventions, then the forms would have been different. [What I will grant is that the dynamics of the split nib and the rationalisation of stroke modulation towards an orthogonal axis (vertical for upright letters, corresponding to the angle of slant for italics) is aesthetically suitable to the intellectual tenor of the period. But since these conventions precede or, at least, come very early in the proto-Enlightenment period -- fully developed in the italics by the mid-17th Century --, how are we to judge the relationship between form and idea? Maybe the writing not only influenced the form of the ideal, but also the notion of the ideal.]

'Visionary' fantasies are no less fantasies, and the underlying mathematics that describe 'the ultimate nature of reality' are not convertible to the macrophysical realm, as Schrödinger demonstrated (the cat is obviously either alive or dead, regardless of what the mathematics of Quantum mechanics tells us). Dürer was just wrong: there is no underlying mathematical geometry to letters, there are only functional requirements and aesthetic conventions that, together, enable a far, far greater range of shapes and styles than are describable by singular geometric constructions.</div>

Yes, there is a disconnect between macro and micro, but Newtonian and Quantum physics both follow on from Durer’s belief in the mathematical structure of the physical world. 

<em>'Visionary' fantasies are no less fantasies…</em>
… until they become accepted as reality.
Durer’s natural philosophy may be more accurately termed theorizing, rather than fantasizing.

<em>Dürer was just wrong: there is no underlying mathematical geometry to letters…</em>

He was right, and proved it by demonstrating that letters could be described by geometric lines.
And today, you and I work in digital media, drawing letter forms by vectored paths.

<em> …there is nothing intrinsically rational or scientific about these letterforms that could not be claimed for any other style of lettering plotted on graph squares…</em>

Certainly, any letter form may be plotted on a grid, but the Roman du Roi was exceptionally rationalized, in the sense of being simplified. 

The Didone style of type did of course, as you say, have a history of many threads, but it seems to me that its underlying premise is that letter forms may be reduced to simplified geometric <strong>outlines</strong>.

The idea that letter designs may be conceived of as constructed from (geometric) outlines is fundamentally non-chirographic.
This is the theory demonstrated by Durer and Tory, the Roman du Roi, and PostScript.
And it is the principle which informs the didone style,

Post hoc ergo propter hoc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">wikipedea entry here</a>]

Yesterday Gerrit Noordzij sent me the following (I sometimes send him links to threads for his information or amusement):

<em>The discussion drags the participants back into the tread down paths that I tried to leave:</em>

<em>The pen does not control form, but strokes.
Broad nib writing is controlled by the tool,
Flexible pen writing is controlled by the hand. Pressure is only possible in the direction of the hand (The Stroke p. 71 and L’Encyclopédie, Paillasson, picture attached).</em>

"tread down paths" should be read as tread-down paths, an adjective / noun combination. When I asked what a "tread down path" is, Noordzij replied: I wanted to say tread down with a meaning like worn-out. The tread down path I have in mind is the conventional talk about writing and the classification of type.

[This makes the leaving of "tread-down paths" thing more clear.]

I asked: But didn't they choose from and follow conventions of arranging type in columns that they were familiar with because of the manuscript tradition?

GN: Of course. And not just the columns, but also the arrangement of paragraphs, the use of versals and, first of all, the shapes of the writing. They conformed to all aspects of the manuscript tradition, but not to imitate it, let alone to make the reader believe that the typography was written by hand. Without these current characteristics of a book, their books wouldn’t be books. In the same manner type designers didn’t try to imitate handwriting, they just cut the elements of writing. The alternative wouldn’t be recognized as writing.

I have no idea what you mean by this Peter.
Are you agreeing or disagreeing with me?

Describing letter shapes by outlines does, of course, require those outlines to be made by a hand-held mark-making device, but by “non chirographic” I mean that the process does not involve creating stroke weight as a property of the pen nib, either by its thickness (broad nib) or the amount of pressure applied (flexible nib). It is a conceptual, designerly process, in which stroking plays no physical role. Such outlines could even, in theory, be coherently produced by a succession of small dots, i.e. pointillism. In type, by cutting with punches.</div>

Yes, I proposed straight causality.
I wasn’t sure whether you were contesting the notion of outline construction as being after-the-fact, or suggesting that the idea of it being non-chirographic is after-the-fact.

My superimposition of a circle over the outline of a Bodoni “C” demonstrates that his logic was concerned with constructing via outline shapes, not strokes.

You are confusing the practical ability to use geometry to describe arbitrary and conventional shapes with the idea that there is a geometry underlying those shapes. The geometry is something that we apply, not something that resides within the letterforms. Vectored paths are useful in our work precisely because they are so flexible that we can use them to describe virtually any arbitrary shape presuming we have a unit grid fine enough. There is no underlying mathematical geometry in the letters, no Platonic abstract ideal of the letters. There is only the cultural conventional collection of shapes that we recognise as letters, and the common historical phenomenon, repeated all over the world, is that those shapes evolve first through writing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I don't have difficulty seeing the point that the hand controls the modulation of the split nib stroke weight. But as Noordzij notes: <em>Pressure is only possible in the direction of the hand.</em> Remember that I am interpreting the influence of written forms on typographic forms -- or as Noordzij puts it, ‘cutting the elements of writing’ -- in terms of <em>styles,</em> which I see as constituted, in the case of writing, by particular ductus (movement sequence, and in the case of the split nib also pressure) and particular tool. The fact that the split nib can create so much more greatly varied modulation patterns than the broad nib, by virtue of the controlling hand, is orthogonal to these observations, because the actual range of styles of writing and type based on the expansion stroke model is comparatively small, especially with regard to type. There is little evidence of rotation, and hence, since pressure is only possible in the direction of the hand, the patterns of thick and thin strokes tend to be regular and mostly replicating conventional patterns in letters that evolved as written with a broad nib. The fact that we can, with a split nib, write letters in ways that contravene those conventional patterns didn't mean that we did.

[The exceptions, as illustrated by the image Peter posted above, is in what typographers are obliged to call swash styles, which the same image shows in their context, which is that of ornament. It is instructive, I think to contrast the letters created by 17th and 18th Century writing masters with the ornamentation with which they surrounded those letters. There is much greater variation in the modulation patterns of the ornaments, much greater evidence of rotation and of discretion in the amount of pressure, than in the the letters.]</div>

<blockquote>A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.</blockquote>

That's Walter Benjamin, of course. My codicil to this is that we, the living, ride on the shoulders of the angel. Some of us are facing forwards towards the past and some of us are facing backwards towards the future. I don't know whether we've chosen to sit that way, or were put there by genetics or by providence. I do know that it is frequently difficult to understand, appreciate or even remember to respect the people who are sitting the other way. But that does seem to me something that we can choose.</div>

True, the territory is not the map.
But when we learn to read and write, it is by categorizing letter forms according to their basic topology, which is simple geometric figures.
Durer took the idea of that geometry a step further, by demonstrating that the ductus of pen, or whatever was used to style monumental capitals, could be systematically translated into mathematical language. It would be possible to then describe the shapes purely by text, without reference to the images.
That's not really surprising, as the “organic” movements of the hand follow basic letter shapes that are geometric, and the tool is a system which bears rationalization.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DurerFont1_6436.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, the geometry of the letter as a shape, what you call its basic topology, and the geometry that can be used to describe the <em>outline</em> of particular letterforms are quite distinct things, which is why I remain unimpressed by Durer's exercises (although his visual results are better than those of most attempts by this contemporaries, which suggests that he knew more about the conventional, organic forms than they did, so had a better idea of what it was to which he was applying the geometry). Ironically, the only way to get from the geometry of the basic topology to a modulated letter is to apply a stroke model (which is exactly what CJK stroke-based font technologies do). Geometric construction of an outline is an outside-in approach, while application of a stroke model to the basic topology is an inside-out approach. Both are legitimate design processes, but unless we're setting out to design something 'experimental' -- i.e. contravening the norms of either basic topology or conventional modulation --, then it seems to me that we have little choice but to acknowledge the chirographic, because after 550+ years we're still designing typographic letters whose modulation patterns were established in the writing of particular times and places.

Chris: <em>Clearly you disagree, but I place that moment of passing the baton over to construction techniques at the moment of didone types. Writing was no-longer leading the pack, it relinquished its role and became only a historic marker.</em>

I think where I disagree is with the notion of a moment, of a passing of the baton. I do think that something important happened in the period we're talking about, beginning with the Roman du Roi as Nick suggests, and that one of the things this involves is the idea of rationalisation, in both form and manufacture. But I see this as a process that begins in the late 17th Century and doesn't really come to fruition until the late 19th Century, when two key things happen: we cease to be a scribal culture because of the introduction of the typewriter, and the manufacture of typefaces becomes an industrial, machine process. That's the point at which, if the Roman du Roi were then proposed, it could have been manufactured direct from the engraved plates, via pantograph, without the interpretative skills of Grandjean. So that's 200 years that seem to me too long and messy to say that there is a moment at which writing relinquishes its role and a kind of constructivism takes over. And still I ask, what was being constructed, what was being rationalised, if not writing? Where did the shapes that were being rationalised come from? Where did the modulation patterns resulting from the construction come from?</div>

I think that when the forms are "drawn," as opposed to "written" with a tool that "informs" the letter, the word ductus becomes irrelevant. Certainly there is an order to which "thing" YOU do first but; a calligraphic tool defines the path and order of the making of a form.

My favorite trick was to tape two pencils to a big fat rubber eraser.  I used mechanical pencils to avoid the harrows of sharpening ;-)  Later, I used a block of wood with holes drilled in it to fit the pencils.  I sometimes added a 3rd pencil off axis to limit the thins.  My all time favorite is still flat blocks of charcoal on rough paper.

That is exactly why I like it, John!  Also, it gives hints of speed of stroke with the darker parts being slower.  Stroke direction is also quite clear.  Mostly, it allows me to draw quite large and use full arm and body--a much more assured rhythm than the tiny metacarpals.  </div>

Could you show examples? I have a feeling that's something else.
However -as I myself mentioned towards the end of that thread,
which you're probably too flustered to have read- the work of
Ray Eames, in the form of the "Cover Numerals" is indeed much
older. However that's not exactly what I was talking about either
since there's no formation of "bodies".

Maybe I was being too nice - I apologize. The truth is the class was
all middle-aged housewives, and when I pointed out what aspect
of calligraphy I wanted to explore (what I call "faux type") he was
visibly perturbed. He knew his stuff, and I learned quite a bit, but
it was still cheesy.

Agree 100% now that I have a (very) little of experience. However when doing the very first baby steps in drawing letters, having the "ductus" concept of the imaginary pen in mind, was very useful in learning where to put the weight when drawing.

> ...a calligraphic tool defines the path and order of the making of a form. 
Yes, mostly. But you can also "Cheat" the tool. For example, while most formal scripts are done using a pointed pen, you can also use a broad nib pen and turn it over the edges for drawing the hairlines (as in some of the samples from the Universal Penman).
Another example: Most calligraphy manuals teach you "Never change the angle of the pen" however the truly beautiful forms comes from rotating the angle while dragging it, and by using just a portion of the chisel instead of the full surface of it, and also by varying the pressure.
I believe that to truly "feel" the Ductus thing, you have to try real calligraphy tools. The 2 pencils taped together won't do it. (However, is useful as a teaching concept).
More over... it's not just the tool.. it's the position of the hand, the arm... the full body motion and the tool working together.

> Drawn and written are two very different things to me
Yep, different, but interrelated.

> and yes I do both.

The problem is you're not necessarily putting the weight where
the reading eye needs. And the more you rely on it the further
you probably are from where you should be.

Keep following that logic - you will end up in a land
entirely free of ductus, breaking away from painting
and moving into the proper determination of notan,
which is the heart of reading, hence type design.

> different, but interrelated.

I see them as being at 90 degrees; they sort of point
in the same direction, but of course if your direction
of travel is off by ~45 degrees soon enough you're lost!

I understand that text faces have a entire different set of rules, and that good reading flow and rhythm is more important that beauty. However they can also be beautiful, for example: Zapf Renaissance, Galliard

Actually my view is that a text face must have an ugliness to be real.
Think for example of how the lc "g" <em>must</em> be a little cramped, otherwise
more important things throughout the entire font go off balance.

Once I see that the angularity in a face such as Trump Mediaeval is thematic, and serves a purpose in the way that the glyphs work together, then I have developed sufficient taste to appreciate the abrupt styling of the individual glyphs, which I might not have if I am just looking at a single glyph in isolation, with no knowledge of the face as a whole.

The perception of (aesthetic) ugliness may thus be as much the result of ignorance on the viewer’s part, as ineptitiude by the artist/designer.

		<div class="commentbody">All the stuff having to do with style is not imposed by the designer.  It is imposed by the viewer--mostly the so called "expert viewer" or critic who gets the defacto job of telling the masses what they are "supposed to" find beautiful.  Those who praised the Academy painters also damned the Fauves.  Later, the Fauves were looked upon as gods and the Academy was damned as nothing but stylistic copies of the Greco-Roman classics.  Later, the Surrealist praisers condemned the Fauves, the non-objective lovers damned the whole lot of them, and so on until today.  All of the works created throughout history have not changed.  Each were either damned or praised at some point in time at the discretion of whoever society looked upon as "Experts".  The artists only role was doing the work.  Many were dead before disfavor or favor struck their work.

As a viewer, you can choose to look at work you do not care for and blaspheme it or condemn its creator as some sort of categoric name that you dislike like "Artist".  You may also praise work you like and give its creator a categoric name that you admire like "genius" or "Designer".  That does not change the work or the reasoning behind creation of the work, it only defines your opinion of the work and its maker. We can opine about what we thought was the motivation for or reasoning of the work by the maker but we never truly KNOW it to be true.  Of course there are those who may assume everything that they think is true in their own narcissistic mind.  No matter how loudly they shout or bang their shoes, their opinion will never be universally shared.  Opinion and declaration of good taste and proper style and artistic genius are passing fancies.

<em>The problem is you're not necessarily putting the weight where the reading eye needs. And the more you rely on it the further you probably are from where you should be.</em>

Hrant, I think you're begging the question -- indeed, have been begging it for years now -- by proceeding directly from identification of the constraining limits of the pen vis à vis edge to the assumption that this is 'wrong', the assumption that what the reading eye <em>needs</em> is different from the considerable range of modulation patterns and edge relationships that people have read around the globe for centuries, and the assumption that there is a proportional relationship between how closely type design follows writing and how far it is from that need. You say you don't need to prove anything 'even to yourself', but if you want people to follow your intuitions, you need to start providing at least some evidence to back up some of these assumptions, otherwise your arguments will quickly become an enclosed circle.</div>

Reading is a task that is improved with diminishing returns, and is something that people already do so well that functional optimisation is not only unnecessary but perverse, since it implies far greater constraint than any writing culture has accepted. This is good news for typography, because it means that text isn't constrained by the kind of limitations that a narrow functionality would impose.

Even assuming the possibility of ideal functionality -- how would you determine it? how would you ever know that there was no further improvement to be found? -- you're still begging the question if you assume that it cannot, in fact, reside in forms in which the edges have a particular relationship such that might be created with a writing tool. You simply can't know that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1) The smallest room for improvement has never stopped certain people.
However I happen to believe that the way fonts are currently designed
(and deployed) is keeping us in the functional dark ages of reading.
2) I don't see an absolute requirement for conscious acceptance. The
maker of a text font is necessarily working "under the radar" of reader
consciousness. This is not to say conscious acceptance can be ignored,
it's simply that it's another design dimension. And it is exactly the sort
of thing that is highly malleable (unlike our reading "hardware", at least
not within many thousands of years).
3) It's not a constraint, it is, again, another design dimension. Whatever
one concludes -with or without empirical proof- one is free to violate.
For example in Patria I made some glyphs (like the "a", "e" and "s") a bit
wider than is good for readability - this to reinforce the somewhat "hefty"
(masculine) character of the face. The important thing is simply to know
-or merely believe- something (about readability).

> how would you ever know that there was no further improvement to be found?

If I thought that were possible, I would
have used "perfect" instead of "optimal".  :-)

And yes, I don't "know that"; I probably never will; and nobody
will probably ever know (since I believe that A System Can Never
Understand Itself). But a designer tries to understand, and then
takes action based on what he has learned, with more a little bit of
Faith. BTW to me this is the essence of Post-Modernism (where
Modernism insists on Knowing, and taking action only based on
what it sees as the uncontestable).

How are you measuring effort?

I think you think the script system some of us have been born into and others have adopted is medieval. But that's another matter than optimizing notan within a conventional script.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I think I might have made some positive contributions to a number of people's understanding of how perceptual processing in reading actually works, and proposed some ‘typographical craft-knowledge’ motivated alternatives to the conventional understandings of reading available in cognitive scientific, neuro-phenomenological and perceptual psychophysical studies of reading. 

My interest ever since my Thessaloniki presentation in 2004 was to provide “perceptual processing touchstones for type design and typography,” that is, to say ”why strategic construction, a well-motivated contrast scheme and space-craft still matter.”

I still like many of the things we were discussing then, like perceptual distances between letters, similars and modulars, diversifying boumas, consolidation of the bouma, how reverse saccades migh be diagnostic in telling us where problems in the script system lie, even notan. I think you are right in insisting that constraints native to the tool that gave the western script system its shape not prevent us from these kinds of explorations. I understand your communication strategy I think. To make room for productive exploration you rely on arguments which are thought-provoking, destabilizing and even instinctively attractive. Against the background of what I know, a sense them to be not always accurate, well-founded or fully justified. You inverse relationship law about distance from the constraints imposed by the tool to proximity to what’s optimal for the eye is an example of this. It's just not that cut and dry and misrepresents the value of what's evolved, and the usefulness of form-analytic tools proposed by others, which is what I try to show.

I think my current view of perceptual processing in reading is a deepening of the notion that reading is bouma-based. The deepening came through massive immersion in the psychological literature on reading. I hope you can acknowledge that what I try to work at has value.

The application of any idea is never absolute, but any idea

Might there not be some predisposition in perception that avoids equivalence?

I propose that evolution adaptively favors the ability to make fine visual distinctions.
When confronted with perceptual data that show an equivalence between stimuli, a resolution is demanded, because in nature nothing is identical.

Equivalence between vertical and horizontal proportion is disconcerting and to be avoided; this is a broad cultural phenomenon.
When horizontal arms in an organism or artefact are the same thickness as legs, it doesn’t look natural and structurally sound—there are no trees in which this occurs, for instance.

Chirography implements the principle that stem contrast is natural (in harmony with perceptual processes) and desirable, whether by nib width or pen pressure.

Furthermore, the quality of the implement informs the typeface as a style, modulating the effect of the contrast in a systematic way, providing a consistent tonality that doesn’t have to be decoded and reappraised letter by letter. Rather like the timbre of a nusicak instrument.

I've long agreed that "stroke" contrast is a good thing (although not
because of any conscious preference). The thing is, chirography has
arrived at it by happy accident*, and it's much better to simply think
of such contrast on its own terms.

* And by the same token it must also
bring with it some unwanted baggage.

Also, thinking that this has anything to do with <em>evolution</em>
is dangerous, because that takes many thousands of years.

Just for grins:

According to David Brooks' column today, "People remember information that is hard to master. In a study for Cognition, Connor Diemand-Yauman, Daniel Oppenheimer and Erikka Vaughan found that information in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than information transmitted in easier fonts."</div>

Yep, Illy or Ps brushes. Ps brush engine is thing of beauty especially when combined with pen pressure. Create a Calligraphy brush in Illy and texture it in Ps. Or do the whole piece in Ps with custom brush setting(s) and stroked pen tool paths. 

Less than a minute in Ps...

...good luck! Hope that helps.</div>
