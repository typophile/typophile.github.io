body: I am working on a custom house number, and I am having trouble finding some
  interesting examples.  Are there any neat examples of number ligatures?  Or really
  anything that uses numbers in an interesting way beyond just interesting individual
  numbers combined.  To be more specific, nothing too ornate, a kind of 1910s craftsman/foursquare/arts
  & crafts style.  I was thinking of something that could be made as a single piece
  of material instead of mounting each number individually.  Just looking for inspiration
  and ideas at this point.

  body: Thanks!  I don't think the spelled out script is right for this project, unfortunately.  It
    needs to be a good bit less ornate to work with the architecture.  Although it
    is not classic mission or prairie style, so something strictly Arts & Crafts proper
    is not necessary either.  It is not really a historic restoration so being true
    to the era is a loose parameter.  I really love those ligated numerals!  That
    is the kind of thing I was thinking, but I didn't have quite the right search
    terms.  There really are not many examples of that.  I was looking at P22 Dard
    Hunter & ITC Rennie Macintosh, which do offer a good starting point.  I was hoping
    to bring more specific designed relationships between the adjacent numbers than
    a font could afford, and ligatures was how I was thinking about creating that
    feel.  Thanks for the responses!  Off to sketching...

  body: I hired John Downer to hand paint numbers for my house sign. The house has
    an Arts & Craft style exterior. The numerals on the sign are based on John's Iowan
    Oldstyle type, which fits nicely with the style of the house and gate, but we
    tested variations of weight and proportion to get the best legibility and impact
    when the sign is seen from the road.

    larger and used more of the space.

  body: Doing a search right now, but not having much luck. I worked with a client
    who bought Futura Serie which had a sweet set of osf but I appear to be finding
    dead and/or usless links. Strangely, many of them are throwing up a bunch or free
    stuff pop-ups. The 1 and 2 are particularly nice. Very close to Neutra Number
    but from a much larger family.
