  most likely that it is hand drawn type created in-house, but does anybody have any
  idea what this script typeface is / know of any around that have similar properties?\r\n\r\nForgive
  the mostly poor quality of the image.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B-W_a_3814.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I don't believe it's quite Roundhand, the F, D, s, i and l don't match up,
    but the image quality does leave something to be desired. \r\n\r\nI'll look into
    it, see if I can't dig something up.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] It looks very similar in many
    ways to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/shelley_script_volante/?affid=98220\">Shelley
    Script Volante</a>. I still don't think this is quite right as the stroke off
    the top of the \"D\" doesn't cross into the main loop (which is very distinct).
    I'd guess it might even be a customized version of Shelley. [/EDIT]"
