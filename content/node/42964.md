body: "All designers work for clients at some time - and sometimes designers sell
  their own graphic art. It would seem then that research about \"who is a designer?\"
  should be focused on a designer's psychology and not on something as limiting as
  how they look. And that which is visual can be limiting and exclusionary and the
  deeper meaning of something or someone.\r\n\r\nDesign has historically attempted
  to counter a commonly held perception for a client's industry or a society's stereotype
  with a visual, tactile, audible, and/or extrasensory convention. The idea of \"differentiation\"
  within a market, society, or any community of any kind is intended to compete for
  attention. Being different from a competing message or experience is the nature
  of questions that designers ask themselves everyday. Asking \"How different can
  I make my client's brand? is one that we likely ask of ourselves. So a designer
  answers their question of \"how am I different?\" in a number of ways.\r\n\r\nI
  think a designer is commonly someone who counters their surroundings with something
  unique and personal - some more extreme than others. They are someone who attempts
  to shift a perception or enlighten some understanding."
