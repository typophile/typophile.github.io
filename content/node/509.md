body: Here is a very interesting and stylish font from the cover of the Bauhaus quarterly
  magazine. Scan from Typography/Basic Principles by John Lewis, published in 1966.
  This is the only book on typography I have in the house, as I am a poor student.
  Sniff. Still, some of the typographic ideas are stimulating, and this font inspired
  my font Feynman Regular. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/1245.gif"

  body: ' Thanks a lot... I notice none of these fonts mimic the style entirely. Since
    no proper version seems to exist, would it be alright to make a modern version?
    or are there copyright laws to stop this happening? &#40;of course, I would attribute
    the font to joost&#41;. <BR>Matthew Brown '
