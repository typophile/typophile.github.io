  requiring all caps (for example, post/zip codes) where the main body of the text

    I don't mind the RSVP as shown, it's kind of cool in an over the top way, just
    like a wedding dress."

  body: That's great. Thank you both very much. The Hoefler works well in this instance
    and Nick, I think you're also right just to embrace the over-the-top nature of
    the RSVP! Cheers, Pete
