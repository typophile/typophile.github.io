body: "After we were all informed of Glen's death I went in search of the cover I
  did for his compilation of calendars a couple of years back. I found it today and
  it brought back many memories. His calendars were compilations of different lettering
  artists doing basically \"fun and bizarre\" facts. They were always amazing and
  contained amazing takes on the alphabet by artists from all over the world. I think
  the calendars are still available but the book never got produced, sadly. Anyway...
  here's to you Glen!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GE_5284.png]\r\n\r\nMichael"
