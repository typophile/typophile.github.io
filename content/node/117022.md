  one of the first computerized Blackletter fonts, with a quite short lifespan due
  to being replaced by more elaborate versions such as the regular Old English / Cloister
  Black. But I know it's still out there somewhere! ;)\r\n\r\nPeople have pointed
  me towards Stencil Old English Lucinda and Cloister Black, of which it is neither."
