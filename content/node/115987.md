  body: "I'm not aware of anything digital. \r\nThe distinctive bowed strokes on some
    letters and the unusual tilde serifs on them remind me of the ATF font Invitation,
    dating from 1917 or earlier. Invitation has bowed strokes on the same letters
    and usual serifs on them, but these are in the form of a reverse wedge rather
    than a tilde.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InvitationCharmapSM_6291.jpg]\r\nOne
    influenced the design of the other, but I don't know the direction of the causation.\r\nDon"

  body: I'm hoping that perhaps someone who creates fonts as somewhat of a "hobby"
    might want to tackle digitizing this typeface.

  body: "If you are hoping somebody will digitize the font you might improve your
    chances by posting any additional titles you might have so that there is a more
    complete alphabet, if possible including infrequent letters like Q and the &.
    \r\nBTW who was the music publisher? US? British? Other?\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, this is a US font, used for many, many movie
    songs in the 1930s-40s, and then used for most Broadway song titles published
    by the Edwin H. Morris Company. \r\n\r\nI have samples of almost the entire alphabet.
    I'm missing upper case Q X and Z, and lower case j q and z. \r\n\r\nThanks so
    much for your help!\r\n\r\n- Bob"
