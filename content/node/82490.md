  body: Well, it's from 1973. They didn't have digital warping back then, although
    they did have special distortion lenses. Even so, this looks hand-drawn to me.
    First, the crossbar on the G would be slanted if distortion had been used. Second,
    the curls on the L's are different. In any case, I'm not aware of any font that
    would match it, although I think there are some with a similar feel. Search "art
    nouveau" or "psychedelic" on MyFonts.
