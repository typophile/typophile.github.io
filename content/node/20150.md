    for text\" thing: obviously some types are going to work better in body copy than
    others, but really you can interpret it any way you want. Just make the paragraph
    look good. (Hey, if you can make a retro log face work in body copy, go for it.)"

  body: "To my slowly-becoming-less-untrained eye, I am, again, really impressed.
    I agree that Kristian's is pretty incredible, and I really dig the little hooks
    on Sebastian's. And I'm glad that dtw even took the time to do a ligature. I'm
    interested in how all of you went about this problem, and what your strategies
    were behind optimizing the letters for text setting.\r\n\r\nNot knowing really
    how to start, here's what I did: After I messed around a little yesterday with
    a pen, I decided that it was gorgeous out, so I went out on the deck and drew
    out each letter on graph paper, x-height about an inch an a quarter (3cm). Then
    I came inside a couple hours later, scanned that, and traced it in illustrator,
    doing a lot of copying and pasting of serifs and stems in the process (a quick
    way to establish consistency, I figured). Then, the copy and paste job in illustrator
    was another hour and change, spacing the letters manually (that was a mistake).
    My thinking behind this alphabet is that I wanted to allow for reasonably high
    ascenders without ridiculous leading. So I made big blocky serifs to emphasize
    the line of text so that I didn't have to make the leading too generous. Of course,
    my submission is no battle-winner, but it's a start (for me at least).\r\n\r\nIs
    that similar/different to what you did/thought about while doing? Just curious."

    bits (verticals, horizontals, serifs), plug 'em together and tweak to fit, with
    occasional sideways glances at Karen Cheng's book...\r\n\r\nAll drawn on one line
    in CorelDraw and then imported into TypeTool (see, a non-designer with non-designer's
    software! LOL). Sidebearings as per Cheng, kerned about \xBC of the necessary
    pairs then thought 'stuff this, it's taking too long'... Paragraph assembled line
    by line in Photoshop as I'd stuffed up the vertical metrics.\r\n\r\nI do like
    Kristian's: those serifs are far more elegant than my hobnail-boot-like ones!\r\n__________________________\r\nEver

    optimizations: sturdy strokes, rather short ascenders and descenders (for my means...)\r\n\r\nAnti-text:
    maybe too detailed yet, and there are two different designs in it at the moment.
    There would be so much to do, but I have to leave now, otherwise we need a support
