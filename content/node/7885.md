body: 'For reasons which shall currently remain nameless, lately I&#39;ve been reading
  many books on typesetting and page layout.  Two which have stood out are Tschichold&#39;s
  <i>The Form of the Book</i>, and Bringhurst&#39;s much-recommended opus.  &#40;Far
  less memorable is Felici&#39;s <i>Complete Manual of Typography</i>, which is not
  complete, not a manual, and not &#34;a guide to setting perfect type&#34;, whatever
  <i>that</i> is.&#41;  I&#39;ve also read a collection of Eric Gill&#39;s essays,
  and several other miscellaneous works. <BR> <BR>To cut to the chase scene, does
  anyone have any other recommendations?  I&#39;m looking for works along the lines
  of <i>The Form of the Book</i>, namely specific opinions on what constitutes good
  and bad typography for books. I feel the best way to learn one&#39;s preferences
  is by experimenting, but more opinions are always interesting if not useful.  Like,
  I agree with a lot of Tschichold&#39;s advice wrt spacing issues yet much of this
  runs contrary to Knuth&#39;s decisions in TeX, so I&#39;ve always doubted I knew
  what I was talking about.  &#40;I still do, but that&#39;s beside the point. <IMG

  <BR> <BR>Now for the useless rant. <BR> <BR>Why is it the modern editions of many
  of these works touting good typography practices are, shall I kindly say, less than
  optimally set?  The most notable oopsie I&#39;ve run across was in the Hartley &amp;
  Marks edition of <i>Form of the Book</i>, page 95: <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>Three-to-em
  spacing must be used in all headings and espe-<br>cially in setting text. Care must
  be taken to make the spaces<br> between &nbsp;the &nbsp;words &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;line
  &nbsp;optically &nbsp;equal, &nbsp;&nbsp;in &nbsp;particular<br> when type is being
  handset.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR>Overall the book is set in
  a loose &#34;modern&#34; style with a goodly dose of leading, but that unfortunate
  paragraph is made all the worse by its subject matter.  The first thing I noticed
  on the page was the phrase &#34;optically equal&#34; surrounded by whitespace and
  lines of tighter text above and below it.  I want to believe it was deliberately
  done this way as an ironic example, but the book has too many other issues for this
  to be credible.  &#40;For example, I noted a few places where widows were &#34;avoided&#34;
  by the less-than-impressive device of using a three-character hyphenation to make
  two lines out of one.&#41; <BR> <BR><br>Then there&#39;s the Felici book, which
  to my untrained eyes looks as if it was<br><br>designed to use the maximal amount
  of paper with the least amount of content.  I<br><br>realize much, if not all of
  this is all about personal opinions, but I haven&#39;t seen<br><br>many books set
  with more spacing.  Lines with sufficient decenders aren&#39;t that<br><br> bad,
  but other paragraphs lend an unfortunate resemblance to corn furrows.<br><br> <BR>
  <BR>&#40;Not even considering that the book will date itself in five years... &#34;Our
  motto is, &#39;From publisher to trashcan in less than a decade!&#39;&#34;  And
  the wacky square page format doesn&#39;t work; who has that much room on their desk?  It
  would make a nice seagull though--simply attach a head and a tail.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
  contrast these against, say, Morison&#39;s pamphlet <i>First Principles of Typography</i>,
  which is closely set with a sensible amount of leading, a solid workhorse font,
  and a comfortable page layout.  It doesn&#39;t stand out as a remarkable work of
  typography, but to me that&#39;s precisely the point: it does its job, and does
  it simply and efficiently. <BR> <BR>It is a challenge for me to swallow advice from
  people who produce modern books such as these. &#40;But I certainly can&#39;t blame
  Tschichold for what happens in a translated edition of his work published long after
  his death.&#41;  Am I just confused?  Hopeless?'

  body: I too did the same thing. Read Form of the Book cover-to-cover &#40;noticing
    that it was not necessarily typeset according to the what was written&#41; and
    of course Elements. However, I&#39;ll make a few comments. 1. In Elements, Bringhurst
    explains how it is preferable in theory to optically align pages with hanging
    hyphens. I have even seen in another book how to do it in Quark, but of course
    it&#39;s completely impracticle to typeset it that way unless you happen to be
    using InDesign. 2. Regarding your problem on page 95. Firstly he was talking about
    hand-setting it, secondly, with programs such as InDesign and I believe TeX &#40;not
    that I have ever used the latter&#41; you have the option of glyph scaling. I
    am sure that Tchichold in his world of lead type would never have dreamed of such
    technologies. <BR> <BR>I tend to use Elements as a guide, but even so, setting
    small caps in the time that Elements was done, was a tedious process &#40;again
    I&#39;m only talking about programs that I knew such as Quark, PageMaker, FrameMaker
    etc, I have no idea about Tex which I kinda understand can do anything&#41;, but
    then again today with programs such as InDesign, this is very straightforward.
    I only say this because when all type was set by hand, it was no more effort to
    use the correct figure then to use the incorrect one. Since the advent of the
    Apple Mac with Aldus Pagemaker, making DTP something affordable in the 1980s,
    many compromises were made to the point that good typesetting was very difficult
    to accomplish. Just take the word &#34;difficult&#34;. Those of us who worried
    about switching the ligature to the &#34;ffi&#34; ligature ran into problems of
    letter spacing and hyphenation. And the mainstream apps such as Quark et al meant
    that these typographical nuances were simply ignored. <BR> <BR>Today, when I offer
    my clients, true ligatures, hanging punctuation, real small caps, real superiors
    etc etc, they simply do not realise what they are getting since they are so used
    to the mediocre level of typesetting where large typesetting house happily typeset
    their books in Times New Roman and happily have very tight or very loose tracking
    so that they can fit there text to the page according to some book designers warped
    understanding of what a book should look like. <BR> <BR>I guess this is why typesetting
    books are typeset badly! What I do is read the content of the book and for real
    application of the book I try and find old books that were typeset well in the
    days of lead where only the professionals knew that the location of the small
    letters were in the lowercase of the box of lead characters.

  body: 'Popescu, <BR> <BR>Tschichold spends several paragraphs in a detailed discussion
    of using closely-set type and avoiding excess spaces. For example, he makes specific
    recommendations against extra spaces after sentence endings, and insists that
    using fixed spacing between lines is &#40;in general&#41; the right thing to do.
    I was also surprised to learn that he felt widows were less of a sin than using
    extra spacing, and I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with that. <BR> <BR>By default
    TeX uses extra and variable spacing all over the place: spaces after sentence
    endings are 1.5x the width, flexible &#34;glue&#34; is usually inserted between
    lines, spaces after other punctuation marks are given extra glue, and additional
    complexities are used.  I&#39;ve never particularly cared for the resulting appearance
    yet I&#39;ve always felt my judgement was a bit off.  Turns out at least one other
    person agrees with me, at least to some extent. <BR> <BR>The reason I&#39;m asking
    about typography books is because I&#39;m writing my own typesetting engine &#40;hopefully
    it&#39;ll be available someday--for free, of course&#41;, and I&#39;m looking
    for various opinions on what constitutes good and bad typography so I can try
    to make it flexible enough to accomodate them. I&#39;m also thinking about other
    approaches to the whole &#34;is this a good layout?&#34; heuristic analysis than
    the somewhat simplistic ones used by most of the other systems I&#39;ve worked
    with. Looking at &#34;optical spacing&#34; is a start, but it seems there may
    be additional information that would help to guide the process. <BR> <BR>While
    human intervention is always going to be necessary for truly beautiful results,
    I want to try and get as close as is reasonable.  And while WYSIWYG systems are
    an excellent choice for many things, the project that prompted me to do this just
    isn&#39;t feasable with such a system. <BR> <BR>Soon I should have some output
    worth showing, and then people can tell me how full of crap I am and I won&#39;t
    feel so bad about criticizing Felici or Bringhurst <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I think it&#39;s pretty widely accepted that some of the default settings
    in TeX run contrary to what most people nowadays would regard as good typographic
    practice. &#40;You can&#39;t blame Knuth, who knew nothing about typography when
    he started the project, and whose prime exemplars were mathematical journals from
    the early 20th century.&#41; <BR> <BR>For example, I&#39;ve never seen a serious
    typographer argue that it&#39;s a good idea to add extra space between sentences.
    Certainly the majority would disagree rather forcefully, I imagine! <BR> <BR>The
    whole business of stretchable vertical space is interesting, because of course
    such a thing wasn&#39;t generally possible with earlier technologies, so it was
    a reasonable thing to experiment with at the time. But I think &#40;and I&#39;m
    not so sure here, but I would guess I&#39;m in a substantial majority again&#41;
    that the results of using this are not usually effective. I don&#39;t think the
    leading between lines is stretchable by default, but the spacing between sections
    and paragraphs certainly is. <BR> <BR>Similarly Knuth&#39;s recommendation to
    use a spaced-out em dash for punctuation is rather eccentric. Most people would
    use either a spaced-out en dash or &#40;less commonly&#41; a pretty tight em dash.
    <BR> <BR>Bringhurst is a much more reliable guide on matters of style, in my humble
    and rather ignorant opinion. &#40;The only suggestion in Bringhurst that I find
    completely baffling is his insistence that, in a ragged-right setting, it&#39;s
    best never to break words. Would anyone care to convince me of this?&#41;

  body: Don&#39;t forget that the defaults for TeX were set in the early 1980s, and
    that just because they are the defaults doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t change
    them. For example, if you don&#39;t like the extra space after a sentence, just
    put &#92;frenchspacing in your preamble. That&#39;s no more difficult than setting
    up InDesign. &#40;And yes, TeX and InDesign are my two main typesetting systems.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;glue&#34; in between paragraphs, I agree it can be dangerous
    &#40;and I frequently have to &#34;defeat&#34; it when I typeset with TeX&#41;.
    Systems built on TeX, such as <a href="http://www.pragma-ade.com/">ConTeXt</a>,
    offer good facilities for typesetting on a grid. <BR> <BR>And while Knuth did
    do a lot of research on typography while developing TeX and Metafont, I wouldn&#39;t
    use the TeXbook as my typographic guide except for matters mathematical. Bringhurst
    is a much better guide. &#40;And I agree with you, Robin, about the ragged-right
    hyphenation issue.&#41;

    <BR>Aren&#39;t you tryin to reinvent the wheel? i mean yes its true that some
    defaults in TeX aren&#39;t pleasing for everybody but you can change easily. and
    that&#39;s, in my opinion, the best advantage of TeX vs, let&#39;s say, InDesign.
    <BR> <BR>2. [robin huston] Knuth, who knew nothing about typography when he started

    as TeX without knowing nothing about typography. <BR> <BR>3. without the glue,
    TeX paragraph composition algorithm will be useless, isnt it? <BR> <BR>4. why
    not use interline extra space if its so little that the eye is fooled and if the
    result will be more pleasant as a whole? the same question about extra compression/expansion
    of types pdfeTeX can do. <BR> <BR>5. ragged-right paragraphs: i use this setting
    for its side effect - fixed interwords spaces &#40;or is the other way - using
    fixed interword space have the side effect of ragged-right paragraphs?&#41;. so,
    if using hyphenation will give me a more straight left margin, why not using it?

    complete detachment between form and content, second - let me choose/change anything

    full customization&#41;, third - dealing gracefully with various input/output

  body: I appreciate all the thoughtful comments and sincere feedback. <BR> <BR>I
    agree 100% you can&#39;t &#34;learn&#34; good typography from reading, as it&#39;s
    more art than science at this point.  I&#39;m not looking for magic formulas or
    rote approaches, because I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any one answer to what
    is &#34;good book design&#34;. <BR> <BR>I do feel that contrasting and comparing
    various approaches is very helpful, and just in the last few days I&#39;ve gained
    new insights into how various people regard the problems.  And I appreciate seeing
    other people&#39;s opinions on what constitutes good design, as I figure it won&#39;t
    hurt. <BR> <BR>The issues I have with TeX are legion, and I&#39;ve been using
    on a regular basis since 1986.  Honestly, it&#39;s time to say goodbye and move
    on. It hasn&#39;t kept pace with the world around it, and trying to drag it into
    the 21st century just isn&#39;t worth the personal effort to me.  I don&#39;t
    need the advantages it offers &#40;a community of users and existing styles&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>What broke the camel&#39;s back was when I went to install Yet Another
    Font and realized what a horrible mess it was to use &#34;non-standard&#34; Type
    1 fonts with TeX.  Then I thought about the style I need, which uses lots of flowing
    parallel text; this is a non-trivial problem for TeX.  And, its page-break algorithms
    are not that good... multilanguage support is iffy at best... and so on.  All
    of TeX&#39;s weaknesses came to a head on this particular project, and none of
    its strengths.  I know people are valiantly trying to make it work in modern times,
    but I believe the fundamental design is inadeqate given the amount of change which
    has taken place around it. <BR> <BR>I totally agree that the tool doesn&#39;t
    make one a good typographer, because almost anything can be used to produce good
    documents.  Heck, I could write raw Postscript if I had to, or bludgeon something
    like groff into doing what I need, or even scribble words on a page with a pen.  My
    problem is that I need to format some very large documents, ones which will be
    updated frequently from a database, and I can&#39;t afford to spend the time setting
    each page by hand.  &#40;Tweaking, of course I expect that; but only a reasonable
    amount.&#41;  I need something that can generate decent output and handle the
    complex formats I&#39;ve wanted for years without having to jump through TeX&#39;s
    ridiculous hoops. <BR> <BR>Charles, thanks for the recommendation for <i>The Art
    of the Book</i>, and I&#39;ll be sure and take a look.  I have my personal collection
    of rare books as well, many of which are beautifully printed &#40;and others which
    are simply awful <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; <BR> <BR>I have my own appreciation of what consistutes
    beautiful typesetting; the education for me is that many people disagree, not
    only with me but  with each other as well.
