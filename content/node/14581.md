  creampuff a lot & Deftone Stylus. They're very sexy fonts & free \r\n(well for non-commercial

    or TrueType format font on http://www.linotype.com costs less than $30, and quite
    a high percentage, I think, of fonts at http://www.myfonts.com are the same.\r\n\r\nOr
    do you want a package of fonts that costs $30 all together? That isn't quite realistic(although
    every month, Linotype has a value pack of five fonts around a certain theme that
    costs $30)."

  body: I like Creampuff a lot (here is a <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/library/fonts/hs/uc_creampuff.htm">link</a>
    at about.com). <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/library/fonts/hs/uc_deftonestylus.htm">Deftone
    Stylus</a> is similar, but not as successful, in my opinion. Are you looking for
    more fonts like these, or just great fonts in general? (In the case of the later,
    you might want to be more specific about your intended uses, so we can offer a
    better gauged answer)

  body: "A lot of free- and shareware fonts are of dodgy quality, but there are of
    course the exceptions that confirm the rule, and some reputable foundries have
    free fonts as well (sometimes for a limited amount of time). Please keep in mind
    that quite a few of those dodgy freeware fonts are actually rip-offs of legit
    commercial fonts and are hurting the type designers and the type industry in general,
    so be careful what you use. For example Creampuff is an illegal pirated copy,
    a big no-no in my book. Deftone Stylus is pretty safe.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking
    of building an archive of legit quality freeware fonts for this board, but I fear
    this won't be received very well by people who actually have to make a living
    out of designing fonts. :^/ What do other people think?"
