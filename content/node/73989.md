  body: "Nick hasn't got to this one yet, obviously...it looks like his brand-new
    Linndale Square is based on this, or at least something very similar. According
    to the following page on MyFonts, it's a digitization of Geometric, an 1885 face
    from the Cleveland Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/linndale-square-nf/\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    had a typeface with GarageFont long time ago (Pomodoro) looking similar.\r\nHave
    planned for an expanded re-release with Psy/Ops. Can't say when.\r\n\r\nCheers"
