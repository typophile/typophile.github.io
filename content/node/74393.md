body: When creating glyphs from components FontLab does not automatically map characters
  named with suffixes to the appropriate alias.dat entry, e.g. mapping K.alt1 to the
  entry for K. Should I just add new lines to alias.dat for alternates, or is there
  some way to get FontLab to do this automatically?

  body: The alias.dat recipes do not automatically inherit from basic glyphs to alternates,
    so you need to create your own recipes for alternates (through copy-paste and
    some editing).

  body: The alias.dat file is a bit of a pain to deal with (you have to quit and restart
    FontLab whenever you change it, for one thing). So what I do is create a text
    file containing composite recipes for the particular font or font family I'm working
    on. Then, all I do is copy the text from it and paste into the "generate glyphs"
    dialog when I'm ready to create the composite glyphs. You can see right away if
    the recipes are working in the preview area below the text field in the "generate
    glyphs" dialog and, if you made any errors, you can cancel before actually generating
    the composites.

  body: My procedure is equal to Mark's one. This gives the possibility to manage
    blocks of recipes and also keep the font "recipe" for future use.
