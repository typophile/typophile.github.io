body: Hello all -- <BR> <BR>My name is Andy and I&#39;m currently a graphic design
  student at San Diego State University. I&#39;m a big fan of the typophile critique
  discussion group and have been looking forward to posting a typeface of my own design
  for critique. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a little bit eager to get some feedback on a face
  I&#39;m currently working on, so I&#39;m posting the completed lowercase set before
  moving on to finishing up the bits and pieces of uppercase and figures that I&#39;ve
  started.  Please let me know what you all think. <BR> <BR>When I started out this
  typeface, my intention was to create a simplified blackletter typeface that is able
  to be stenciled.  As you can see I have definately digressed from this original
  plan but it still hints to its calligraphic roots. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><IMG

    TARGET="_top">Sabbath Black</A> immediately comes to mind. <BR>Yours is more distressed
    and uses simpler forms and I  <BR>think that works well. Yes, the rounded edges
    are more  <BR>appropriate for the theme, which I think of more as  <BR>stamped
    and worn rather than stenciled. <BR> <BR>The &#39;u&#39; and &#39;v&#39; could
    use some more differentiation. <BR>Note how Newlin adds a flourish to his &#39;v&#39;
    and a foot <BR>on the &#39;u&#39; to make them distinguishable forms. <BR> <BR>Overall
    it&#39;s pretty cool and I can see it used in a variety  <BR>of ways - both with
    the classic history in mind and in  <BR>more grunge/punk DIY pieces. <BR> <BR>Stephen

    - caps are secondary anyway - numerals tertiary. <BR> <BR>First of all, the rounded
    form isn&#39;t just &#34;easier on the eyes&#34;, it seems much more authentic
    too. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at. What I see is that it works quite
    well, I&#39;m just unsure about the &#34;downhill&#34;s on the &#34;f&#34; and
    &#34;t&#34;. And I agree with Stephen that there&#39;s a problem with the &#34;u&#34;/&#34;v&#34;.
    What really needs the most work though are the &#34;s&#34; and &#34;z&#34;. BTW,
    I think you forgot the smooth the tail of the &#34;j&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    really like the idea, but  what interest me in your font is the reinterpretation

    reason why I prefer the first version, more geometrical. The result is more unique,
    less revival, more inspired. <BR>I don&#39;t  like the round vervion, it&#39;s

    should go further that way.  <BR>To do so, you could try to regulate the space
    between part of the same glyph. For example, the '

    angular \r\nversion best. u and v are a bit to close in form, s and z could use
    a little closing up.\r\nAre you doing any caps? How about a unicase instead of
    caps?\r\n\r\n"
