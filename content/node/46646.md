  from Hubert Jocham, but looking at his specimens and comparing the letterforms closely,
  it is clearly not.  (K is a dead giveaway). Anybody recoginze this face?\r\n\r\non
  that note, I've identified a handfull of faces that fall in this very contemporary
  class together of very clean sans faces, and I'm wondering what other GREAT faces
  in this mod-danish style please you all?\r\n\r\nDax\r\nVoltA\r\nVoiceSho\r\nBentwood\r\nSari\r\nNoa\r\n\r\n"
