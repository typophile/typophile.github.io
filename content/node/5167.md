  tool in my spare time. Does anyone know: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Can a ttf be created from
  a XML?   <BR>2&#41; Can a ttf be generated from a parser of some sort?&#34; <BR>3&#41;
  Are their any instructions on the web for creating a font &#40;from a back-end point
  of view?&#41; <BR> <BR>Any ideas, references or collaborators would be very welcome!
