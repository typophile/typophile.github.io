    because the facial expressions. In the midst of orgasm &#40;or is it fearful expressions?

    think the designer&#39;s answer is a little too easy.  <BR> <BR>But I agree with
    Tanya, as a heterosexual woman I wouldn&#39;t wear the shirt. Although, I still

    <BR>I was looking at 38.021 for a long time trying to pick out the fonts...I only
    recognized the one for typophile. there&#39;s a lot of tweaking, drawing and alteration
    in there...how is that lacking craft? what is your definition of &#39;craft&#39;
    The only thing that bothers me is how colon bumps into slashslash.  <BR> <BR>otherwise
    I like it, its got that emblem idea, a bit rebelious. a biker patch, kind of labelling
    the person as the typophile before you get the fact that its a site.

    pulp fiction-type novels. in response to one of the previous comments on this
    piece, i know plenty of people, women and men, heterosexual and homosexual, who
    would appreciate the statement made by this submission. who&#39;s to say that

    Although each one does an excellent job of grabbing one&#39;s attention, I&#39;m
    not sure how many people &#40;other than myself&#41; would be comfy wearing a
    T-shirt that dares others to shoot them &#40;38.022&#41;. If these are meant to
    be worn as advertisements for the site, personally I do not feel that the general
    public would be as entertained by, or interested in 38.021. I feel that the simple,
    yet clever play on words and imagery in 38.002 would not only put a smirk on someone&#39;s
    face, but grab the attention of the general public and possibly drive more traffic
    to the site. '
