    I made for DJ Cast Iron for his CD 'Warped Vinyl'. The CD was digitally mixed
    and was a movement away from the vinyl record - so I decided to go to a charity
    shop and melt down some plastic disks.\r\n\r\nThought it was quite cool that the
    name meant something strong but the vinyls were so pliable. Hope you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/17_warped-ava_5170.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nFull

    <em>that's</em> what those were. They were lying on the table outside the elevators
    on the 6th floor at the Buffalo Hyatt. My daughter thought they were really cool,
    but we didn't know what they were."

    The way you've digitized it the original clearly shows through. Evidence that
    starting analog often yields the best results."
