  body: "Hey Stephen!\r\n\r\nScene is working just fine for me ;-) But the issue is
    that I've just finished a corporate identity for a customer and now the same customer
    wants a sub-identity with a similar typeface like Scene - so that's why I had
    to be inspired :-)\r\n\r\nI'll check out your suggestions... thanks man!\r\n\r\n//Henriko"
