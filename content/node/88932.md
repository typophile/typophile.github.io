body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI currently purchase font licensing for a major U.S. corporation
  to use on packaging, in-store signage and advertising. I have been approached by
  our Product Design and Development team about licensing for font usage on products
  they design and sell. \r\n\r\nI have not investigated this in the past and wonder
  if anyone has some expertise and/or documentation I can look it to provide advice
  to me and the team.I do know that P22 required Starbucks to purchase additional
  licenses to cover usage of their fonts on products.\r\n\r\nAny advice or help is
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: "Depending on the specific EULA (End User License Agreement), most foundries
    don\u2019t charge additional fees for font usage on products they design and sell
    at all. Though in such cases often a MUL (multi-user license) is necessary, since
    more than 5 designers (also depending on the specific EULA) use the fonts in large
    companies, this usage itself is usually covered by the basic license. Speaking
    for <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts?filter_by_use=1&sortorder=size&sv=positive&sample=Rag&ss=medium\">FontFont</a>,
    it\u2019s definitely covered."

    on devices, or accessed interactively online through a server, then you will need
    a special licence. '

  body: 'I think the P22 restrictions are somewhat unusual (as I recall House Industries
    has some similar rules), but checking the EULA for each font you intend to use
    in this way is probably the best plan. As Nick mentions, digital products, along
    with rubber stamps, and in some cases using dingbats as primary design elements
    are things to watch. '

  body: "So strange that P22 can keep going with that. \u201CYes you can license the
    fonts, but this and this and that and this and that and this and this is not allowed\u201D.
    There\u2019s no good way to know how much a license will cost beforehand. Why
    not reveal the factors <em>and the formula</em> that affects the price tag? "
