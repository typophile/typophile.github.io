  George Alcock was born in 1964 in Corner Brook, on Newfoundland's west coast and
  raised in that city, as well as St. John's, the capital of Newfoundland. Despite
  the fact that he was an avid visual artist from childhood, he obtained a degree
  in Music (tuba performance) at the University of Toronto. His academic career continued
  with another degree in comparative literature. \r\n\r\nHe designed the charming
  hand-lettered font <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.7072.0.0\">Soupbone</a>
  as an ideal restaurant menu typeface, but it has proved more versatile than that,
  seeing use in multiple contexts, including advertising, children's books, and broadcast.\r\n\r\nBruce
  is currently a commercial and animation director at Global Mechanic, a production
  company he founded in Vancouver BC (http://www.globalmechanic.com)."
