body: "Hello guys I have this identity here that sort of popped up in my head for
  a client. I'm being hesitant here because the simplicity of the symbol, a stylized
  \"V\" is so simple that I have to question the fact if it's already out there. I
  was wondering if someone could identify it for me, if it is indeed. Thanks in advance
  guys.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vitegic_5485.jpg]"

    of each other, culture and history for their inspiration.\r\n\r\nif it was truly
    your idea and fits the objective of your client's product/services, I say proceed
    with it.\r\n\r\nthe mark is simple and elegant, nice work!\r\n\r\n:tony"

    similar would of been done many time. \r\nI think it would do your head in! Think
    of how many logos that been created?! Your choice of typography is really nice.
    Is that a custom or existing?"
