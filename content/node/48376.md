  ad that requires tone on tone black for a subtle embossed look. If the background
  is 100% k, where is the margin for a slightly lighter cmyk black tone for the vector
  graphic laid on top? Could anyone recommend a cmyk black for the foreground image.
  The client's inspiration came from Metalica's \"Black Album\" cover.   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/metallica_black_6384.jpg]"

  body: "Ideally, you would want to print the ad separately and tip it in to the magazine,
    using a spot varnish for this effect, essentially adding a second color over the
    black and running glossy \"clear ink\" on the second plate. \r\n\r\nBut if the
    ad is to be gang printed along with the rest of the magazine, you can use \"Rich
    Black\" for the effect. You can add process colors to the black provided that
    total ink coverage does not exceed certain limits. If possible ask the printer
    what these limits are. Also refer to the following:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/17683]]\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/13795]]\r\n\r\n
    Modulating the process colors can affect the warmth or coolness of the resulting
    color, but since process inks are generally translucent, the net result appears
    as a darker, glossier black than 100% black alone."

  body: "At the print shop where I work this effect is mostly done with using a spot
    varnish on top of the black to produce that look when caught in the right lights.
    As cuttlefish mentioned though for a larger run, like with a magazine, you're
    probably best off using the black and \"rich black\" effect.\r\n\r\nIt may be
    a good idea to talk to the printer about this. See what's possible and compare
    costs.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tylorjreimer.com/\">Tylor
