    helpful if you could learn how to crop an image. Here it is, cropped and with
    improved contrast:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile115153_4043.jpg]\r\nIt's
    familiar font. I'll let another font detective have the fun of naming it.\r\nDon"

    body: "Thank you Don for posting.  I apologize for the size.  I had trouble  attaching
      the image as I was not able to view what was attached and not able to adjust
      the font.  The original scan of the font was done in size 10 so quite surprise
      to see it here in such a large size.\r\nI did not find the process easy and
      usually don't have trouble with the computer.\r\nregards,\r\nfkramer116"

  body: I dunno. I just went through all 9 pages of Mike Yanega's Elaborate or Ornate
    Script category and didn't see it. Another engraver's/stationery typeface that
    doesn't exist digitally perhaps?
