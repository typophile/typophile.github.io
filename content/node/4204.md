  <BR> <BR>I am in desperate need of this font.  Please, if you can, identify this
  font, and point me in the right direction. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: In an earlier thread, the consensus was that the logo is a modified version
    of ICG Narrowband, or at least that was close enough. See the thread <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10591.html">here</a>.

  body: Sorry, but the best you could do is <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=405922"
    target="_blank">Image Club Narrowband</a> to try to come close to that lettering.
    Now that I look at it, it&#39;s not too far off, but usually pro sports teams
    use custom lettering, so these kinds of &#39;desperate&#39; requests will just
    be frustrating for all involved. <BR> <BR>Narrowband comes in 2 weights, but I
    picked the bold page.

    from scratch.  I like to have a base to start.   <BR> <BR>Thanks guys!!!

    an alternate version</a> than the jersey lettering.
