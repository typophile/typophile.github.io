  the style of lettering used in the logo. Apparently nobody there knows which font
  was used for the wordmark. \r\n\r\nOf course, it's been modified, but any help finding
  a match to the original is much appreciated!\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: The base for the logo looks like Contax Pro (55 Regular) from TypeInnovations,
    and then the gaps removed.
