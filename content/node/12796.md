  am after a PC version of the font Randumhouse...I have found it for sale here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&category=&id=14#14\r\n\r\nbut
  don't really want to purchase the entire collection; I really just need this one
  font. Does anyone know of anywhere else I can find it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJared\r\n\r\n"

  body: To best of my knowledge, House only sells their fonts as part of a particular
    collection, not individually, so it's unlikely you'll find Randumhouse anywhere
    else. Try contacting them to see if they'll strike a deal -- what have you got
    to lose?

    fonts? Some of them have a similar feel and they have a bunch of free ones."
