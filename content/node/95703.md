body: "Hi,\r\nI am working for a company and have to design a few procut data sheets,
  broshures and finally a whole product catalouge.\r\nI really would like to take
  Indesign because it is very famous and \"the standard\" for these topics.\r\nBut
  it is really expensive. I have some experience with the program. But I have some
  questions to you. Thank you a lot for answering my questions:\r\n\r\n1.) other members
  of my company would like to use Microsoft Publisher (they all usw Microsoft so that's
  no disadvantage)\r\nAre there any advantages that M Publisher is not able to do?\r\nI
  don't need any 3D or very special stuff. Just for my topics above.\r\n\r\n2.) I
  want to create single sheets. These sheets should be able to combine in a whole
  document.\r\nIs this possible with these \"books\"?\r\nIs it possible to easy create
  a table of content? automatically? an index that is changing if number of pages
  or size of documents change?\r\nIs it possible to link inside the pdf document that
  users can jump from table of content to a specific chapter by clicking?\r\n\r\n\r\n3.)
  How should the structure have been done?\r\nDo I need 2 versions for each file?
  One for printing and one for pdf viewing on computers?? Or is it possible just to
  create one?\r\nAlso with different languages. Is it recommend to use the laysers
  for this thing?\r\nOr not (because of the idea of creating an easy catalouge.) I
  need 2 versions. So does it make sense to combine it in one single file?\r\nThe
  catalouge has to be switched otherwise in every single paper. isn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\nAre
  there any other tips and comments?\r\nMaybe I use a differnt approach or designing
  idea?\r\nthanks a lot for helping me!"

  body: "First of all, this is a typography and type design forum. Your question is
    off topic. No biggy to me but you might et better replies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    (re. question #1) if you are a graphic designer, then from your point of view
    there should be no question. In a contest between MS Publisher and Indesign, it
    would be Indesign all the way. Not necessarily because it is the more appropriate
    tool for the job - or not, but because as a designer it is a good fit for the
    skill set that goes with the job.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you might be an in-house
    designer and some other \"non-designer\" folks you work with, who work with typical
    \"office-job\" tools are going to be involved in creating and maintaining the
    document. Then Publisher makes sense. Especially if you don't want to get stuck
    with the job. Speaking from some personal experience I'm glad to be clear of,
    many thanks to transitioning the doc in question to an MS product that others
    in my dept can work with. The end product is less elegant IMO, but it is a utilitarian
    thing for consultants and contractors and I may be to only person who cares."

  body: "I'm a graphic designer. If you want to do serious page layout, InDesign is
    the way to go. InDesign gives you enormous control over your layout. The downside
    is that it's expensive and has a considerable learning curve.  I can't compare
    InDesign to Microsoft Publisher because MP is not a program that I use (and I
    doubt if any graphic designers use it).\r\n\r\nTable of contents \u2014  Yes you
    can set it up do update automatically. For a short document it might not be worth
    the trouble, but for a big document it's a big timesaver. However a beginner might
    find it a little tricky.\r\n\r\nLayers for different languages \u2014 Yes, that's
    often done, but keep in mind that different languages may run different lengths.\r\n\r\nPDF
    Links \u2014 Yes, you can save your InDesign document as an interactive PDF containing
    links to specific places in the document and/or links to external sites. \r\n\r\n2
    versions ? \u2014 No, you don't have to create one version for PDF and one version
    for printing, and I generally don't. But if your document is going to make a huge
    (file size) PDF because it's really long (like a big catalog) or has a lot of
    graphics, that can be a problem if you want folks to view the PDF online via their
    browser \u2014 not downloaded, but viewed in their browser \u2014 because it may
    take so long to load that folks get annoyed or give up.  In a case like that,
    a shorter or less graphic intensive version might work better for the PDF. Either
    that or make sure the web page warns them it's a big file and tell them to download
    it rather than view it in their browser. But obviously it's a lot less work if
    you can use the same version for both printing and PDF.\r\n\r\nSome general advice
    \u2014 if you're not experienced in InDesign, a big catalog might be biting off
    more than you can chew. You might want to consider hiring someone who's more experienced
    to help you set up the files and lend a hand if you run into problems. Preferably
    someone local so they can demonstrate things for you."

  body: "thanks a lot for your help. \r\nIm don't have that much experience with indesing
    butI really want to deal with that program.\r\nI  think with forums a lot of video
    tutorial I will deal with that.\r\n\r\nso you mean I just need one document? Why
    do I have to choose the format at the beginnign (print or web) just because of
    the art of choosing colors (RGB vs CMYK) and to decide whether the ruler is at
    the dimension of cm instead of pixel?\r\n\r\nFor the project I mentioned above.
    Is the  concept of several documents combined in a book the way to go or wood
    you recommend another style?\r\n\r\nthank you a lot!"

  body: "> so you mean I just need one document?\r\n\r\nYes. InDesign can make a PDF
    from any print document. When I have a document that needs both a print and a
    PDF version, I almost always make just ONE document.\r\n\r\nThe only exceptions
    would be if there's some special reason why a PDF of the print version might not
    work well. Some examples might be if the print document uses special effects that
    won't be visible in a PDF (like embossing or die cuts), or if your boss wants
    users to view the PDF online (on their browsers) but the file size is so huge
    that it would take forever to load. In those special cases, a separate PDF version
    might be helpful as you can design it to avoid those problems. \r\n\r\nBut generally
    speaking, I'd make ONE document for printing and then just make a PDF from it.
    It'll save a lot of time and effort, especially if you're fairly new to InDesign.\r\n\r\n>
    Why do I have to choose the format\r\n\r\nThe print/web choice when setting up
    a document just sets a few things like RGB vs CMYK, the ruler settings, etc. These
    are all things you can change later if you need to, but it saves time to set those
    things correctly right from the start.  If the document is going to be printed,
    I'd use the \"print\" setting. When it comes time to make a PDF, it's no problem,
    InDesign can make a PDF from any print document.\r\n\r\n> combined in a book\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the \"book\" feature, I can't offer advice as that's a feature I don't use (I
    work mostly on shorter documents).\r\n\r\n> I think with forums a lot of video
    tutorial\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea. If you don't mind spending a few bucks, the
    subscription site Lynda.com has several online video courses on InDesign (some
    designed specifically for beginners) that are excellent. "

  body: "> combined in a book\r\n\r\nFor regular documents, there are no pressing
    reasons to use the Book feature.\r\n\r\nFirst off, it means a lot of additional
    (uh..) book-keeping. InDesign <em>can</em> synchronise most important stuff along
    all of a Book's documents, but it doesn't help you <em>fixing</em> things automatically.
    If you decide to use another font in your styles in one document, then synchronise
    this one with the others, you still need to check all of your documents, all pages.\r\n\r\nSecond:
    if you have rather large sections of pages (say, individual chapters, or self-containing
    articles) and you want to be able to move them around at a whim, make a Book.
    If the order of text is predetermined, no need for this.\r\n\r\nThird: in my work,
    I need a single PDF of a document, <em>plus</em> one separate PDF of each chapter.
    (And the inclusion and appearance of individual chapters are, at times, changed
    at a whim by its editors...) Rather than setting up some system to move pages
    around and somehow generate a PDF per so many pages, I make my books a Book.\r\n\r\n\"Single
    sheets\", is that to mean \"pages\"? (\"Sheet\", along with a bed cover, might
    mean something else in book printing. \"Page\" is pretty unambiguous.) You can
    drag individual pages around at will inside a single document. The same can be
    done, naturally, with individual documents inside a book, but somehow it feels
    more natural to keep this inside a single document.\r\n\r\nInDesign can generate
    both Indices and Tables of Contents, but not \"unattended\"; to set these up correctly
    you <em>do</em> need a pretty good understanding of the entire program. Besides,
    once generated, any page numbers will <em>not</em> magically update. After each
    change that may have affected pagination, you need to generate both a-new.\r\n\r\nInDesign
    is <em>not</em> a user-friendly program. It's not targeted at beginners. It uses
    terms unfamiliar to laymen (pica, bleed, slug, point size, ligature, process color,
    overprint, resolution; just to name a random 10). It assumes lots of previous
    knowledge of design, and more than passing knowledge of the printing process.\r\n\r\nNot
    tryin' to scare you off or anything. Jus' lettin' you know."
