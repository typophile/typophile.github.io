body: This is an exageration of certain features of my 'normal' handwriting that I
  developed for a Font design class at City College of San Francisco. My handwriting
  is a mix of upper and lower case, and tends to wobble a bit left and right. It makes
  me look psychotic, which I am, so it works on that account. I like some aspects
  of the font a lot, and would like an opportunity to develop it further. The pen
  used is a uniball Vision fine, which has been my standard pen for many years. Not
  finished to my mind, but here it is.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen2_3585.jpg]

  body: Your sample is a bit too small to read comfortably, and the lack of punctuation
    and the sporadic use of capitals add to the confusion. I think it's an interesting
    font. It's perfect for a journal entry, so the example is good. What changes did
    you have planned?

  body: "Yes, this font was done in Amy's Font Design class at City College. The major
    changes involve lots and lots of unicode so that I have control over how entire
    words display. The 'el's are too strong. There's a version of the font that includes
    the puntuation, which I will post later, thanks.\r\n\r\nk\r\n\r\nOnce it's cheese,
    there's no going back."
