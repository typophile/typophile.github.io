body: "China Type Design Ltd.has customized a set of Chinese typefaces for the Oxford
  University Press China for its Simplified Chinese version of the Oxford Advanced
  Learner's English-Chinese Dictionary, Seventh Edition. Together, the fonts comprise
  about 35,000 characters, including customized characters that were added to meet
  special dictionary usage requirements.\r\n\r\nThe DictSungHKS\u2122 Light font,
  developed for the publication of the Simplified Chinese edition, was customized
  based on China Type\u2019s MSungHKS\u2122 Light font. The company\u2019s MHeiHKS\u2122
  Bold font was also applied to the special headings and labels. Both fonts are based
  on the OpenType\xAE font format and conform to the Unicode\u2122 Standard of multilingual
  digital information exchange. The typefaces also support the Big5 Chinese character
  encoding system. More than 3,000 characters were added to the DictSungHKS-Light
  font to achieve full coverage of the Hong Kong supplementary character set. Special
  characters were added to meet the customized requirements for dictionary usage.
  Also, aesthetic characteristics were enhanced to complement the writing style of
  the latest national character set standard of the Peoples Republic of China, GB
  18030-2005. \r\n\r\nOxford University Press China is completing the Simplified Chinese
  edition of the dictionary in a traditional Chinese desktop environment, the same
  setup that was applied to the Orthodox Chinese edition. Both dictionaries are based
  on the same typographic design, which adheres to a specific house style. While the
  Orthodox Chinese edition is intended for students and advance English learners in
  regions such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, where Orthodox Chinese is used, the upcoming
  Simplified Chinese edition is aimed at Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore, as
  well as other regions where Simplified Chinese is used. \r\n\r\n"
