  versatile enough to cover everything except body text and small stuff.\r\n\r\nI
  found ParaType's \"Textbook\", which is based on a Soviet-era typeface, but it's
  a bit too geometric and doesn't seem to match Agency.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions. While stylistically, the squarish and \"soviet\"
    style fonts would seem to be a good match, unfortunately, I feel they make terrible
    text fonts. I am leaning toward Dobra and Aaux, which fall somewhere in the middle
    between the overly round geometrics and the text-unfriendly squarish fonts.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, at larger sizes, maybe for subheaders, some of these more square and soviet-style
    fonts might work."

    that he certainly employed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find another style of Constructivist
    lettering, employed by him, Stepanova, &c., more interesting.\r\nIt's where some
    of the letters are all sharp angles, and others have slightly curved corners.\r\nIn
    the bottom line of this poster, for instance, \"O\" is a rectangle, but \"C\"
    has the arris smoothed. Why is that?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rodchenko_6049.jpg]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI
    don't understand how a good capitalist face like Agency Gothic, designed by American
    Morris Benton in the 1930s, can represent the Soviet era. \r\n\r\nWhat is the
    distinguishing feature that separates capitalist block poster lettering from that
    of the communists?\r\n"

  body: "Ah, thanks again for the thoughtful and thorough responses.\r\n\r\n@avanyashin:
    Yes, I am definitely still looking for the perfect BODY TEXT match. And ya, I
    think you are right. For now I'm going with Aaux. In general, I have found that
    readability rules out a lot of faces, so I'm not gonna force it. Aaux should work
    for now.\r\n\r\n@Nick: Nice example. I agree that there is not necessarily a literal
    connection between Agency and Communism. I guess I am trying to create a new association
    by virtue or my compositions (posters and spreads). This project is a satire of
    Communism, using a very loose stereotype of it (after all, communism is more of
    a theory than a practice). While I am looking to Soviet styles for inspiration,
    I wanted to create a look/feel that is not tied to a specific culture or time
    period. Agency is very square, geometric, with low contrast. To me, Agency can
    be presented as commanding and austere, which is the general vibe I am going for
    with the project. \r\n\r\nBut, yes, I agree that cultural associations with fonts
    can be tricky. I am definitely trying to create the context for Agency within
    the pieces themselves, rather than relying on prior associations. We'll see if
    it works.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bike_01_bw_sm_5208.jpg]\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a little lost one me. I don't know how important it is for you to get this a across.
    If it is I would try to give it al a slightly more worn look, as these are meant
    for the 'masses'. They just might be too well composed. I think Agency is OK,
    whough another typeface might help to get the idea across. I was thinking of Quanta,
    which has the stencil look as well. Also have a look at Prop-A-Ganda fonts, especially
    Revolucion.\r\n\r\nAs for text, how about FB Nobel, or perhaps Endurance Pro?
    (Endurance Pro family now dead cheap at fontmarketplace.com: only 35 bucks for
    the whole family!) There also is a condensed version."
