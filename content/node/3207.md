body: Hooray for my first post. As I am reading through the forums I am truly honored
  by the amount of talented people there are on this site. <BR> <BR>I am a student
  currently working on a theoretical type project based on the idea of truth. The
  basis is derived from the idea of vocal pattern truth recognition that is being
  used in fields like airport security. My goal is to create a typeface for screen
  applications&#40;TV/Closed captioning is my first goal&#41;that analyzes the vocal
  patterns of a speaker and determines the truth of their words and will alter the
  type if lies are told. Think a lie detector that a television viewer can turn on
  to determine whether any of the words spoken by Bush are true. <BR> <BR>I will be
  building a full character set with UC and lc which is kind of a new thing for captioning.
  They use lc but sparingly. I want to do this because I think that the lc has the
  possibilities for more variations. <BR> <BR>I am pretty solid about my idea&#39;s
  focus and it&#39;s potential benefits, but I am very nervous since my knowledge
  of building typefaces for screen is more limited than my knowledge for print&#40;which
  is beginner also&#41;.  So when I pose questions don&#39;t assume that anything
  is obvious please.  I would really like to understand the ideas behind legible screen
  fonts and make my project a success. <BR> <BR>Since I am building an original typeface
  that is bound for the  screen should I design it as an outline first, then translate
  it to screen/pixel whatever? <BR> <BR>If I am designing the type and its structural
  variations with HDTV&#40;1920 x 1080 res.&#41;in mind, is the process different
  for building a typeface from that resolution vs. a standard TV we used today?  How
  and why are good here also. <BR> <BR>My money, time and resources are limited since
  it is a school project.  What should I be looking at to create this? <BR> <BR>Any
  others words would be greatly appreciated if you can help me with this?  Sometimes
  it easier for me to answer and understand than pose and wait. <BR> <BR>jp <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>As for screen design: <BR>1&#41; Ignore print - it will reduce the quality
    of your screen work. Don&#39;t make an outline font unless you have to. <BR>2&#41;
    Figure out what vertical span &#40;in pixels&#41; you&#39;ll have. <BR>3&#41;
    Figure out how horizontally economical the font has to be. <BR>4&#41; Try to get
    a handle on the types of fidelity loss you&#39;ll encounter, and design with that
    in mind, like by incorporating trapping&#42; &#40;which is not just for outline

  body: I was looking in depth at the basic construction of a bitmap font and wanted
    to know more about the correaltion between the size of the squares used for example
    by Silkscreen &#40;which is only used optimally at 8 pt&#41; and its .014 in.
    square that  builds the form. <BR> <BR>Looking at my options and the time I have
    my approach will probably take this course.  Using a set grid, design a screen-based
    font that will have a set base alphabet and at least one parallel-varied set that
    shows the effects of untruthful statements with a varying line width,  extended
    stems, enlarge counters, etc...  It probably will not be optimal to read at the
    size needed for a closed captioning system, but I hope my main idea will still
    come across. <BR> <BR>Maybe in the future I can extend the family and incorporate
    more of the research into it. <BR> <BR>Any other encouraging information is welcome
    though if you feel I can accomplish the fuller idea or verison of it in a smaller
    time frame. <BR> <BR>josh

  body: 'There are two main kinds of bitmap fonts: <BR>1&#41; &#34;True&#34; bitmap
    fonts where the actual pixel data is defined in bits. These are either stand-alone
    &#40;like in the FON format&#41; or embedded &#40;in a TT font&#41;. These fonts
    only show up when their pre-defined pixel height is chosen. True bitmap fonts
    have unfortunately become second-class citizens in terms of support, especially
    on MacOS. <BR>2&#41; Pixelfonts &#40;like Silkscreen&#41;, which are basically
    outline fonts that can be used at any point size, but which map out the correct
    bitmap data only when a certain point size is chosen. Pixelfonts have robust support,
    because the OS doesn&#39;t know the difference. <BR> <BR>In a pixelfont the point
    size you need to use to make the bitmap come out right depends on the ratio of
    the outline pixel squares to the em size of the font. For example if you fix the
    target point size to 8 and make the &#34;pixels&#34; 125 em units square, you
    can build a bitmap font of any vertical span you want and it&#39;ll come out right
    when the font is set to 8 point. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it avoids
    the user having to fish around for the right point size that will make the font
    snap into place. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    What you might do instead &#40;especially since this font seems to be for &#34;controlled&#34;
    use only&#41; is define a normal em of 1000, and use pixels of 50 units square:

    &#34;  <BR> <BR>While this is not inaccurate, it leaves out an important issue:
    the UPM size. Your calculations assume a UPM size of 1000.  <BR> <BR>The whole
    trick of the size of the grid &#40;i.e. &#34;vector pixels&#34;&#41; is:  <BR>
    <BR>One side: At 72 dpi, the point size that you require is equal the ppem size
    of the font, i.e. the number of pixels that the emsquare will consist of, e.g.
    8.  <BR> <BR>Other side: Your font&#39;s emsquare is built of a certain amount
    of of units, typically 1000. So we speak of 1000 UPM &#40;units per em&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Since 8 pixels correspond to 1000 units, 1 pixel corresponds to 1000/8 = 125
    units. This is really simple math.  <BR> <BR>However, note that if you use FontLab
    to create a font in TrueType format, you will be able to choose any number as
    your UPM size. Therefore, you can as easily set your UPM size to 800 and target
    for a 8 pixels type size, so that one pixel corresponds to 800/8 = 100 units.  <BR>
    <BR>Similarly, if you target a 20 pixels type size, you can use a UPM 1000 and
    then one pixel will correspond to 1000/20 = 50 units, but you can also use a UPM
    200 and then one pixel will correspond to 200/20 = 10, or a UPM 2000 and then
    2000/20 = 100.  <BR> <BR>Keeping this in mind, you will be able to easily target
    &#34;untypical&#34; font sizes such as 13 pixels.  <BR> <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab

  body: '&#40;Wow, I am going to break my &#34;never reply to Hrant&#34; rule for
    the first time in months.&#41; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s not true. Type 1 &#40;and OpenType
    CFF&#41; fonts can be built at any em scale, as long as all points and metrics
    are within &#43;/- 4096 units. <BR> <BR>Additionally, specifying size in points
    for a font intended to be used on screen is meaningless, unless the output device
    is also defined. There&#39;s a good reason folks developing screen fonts talk
    about size in ppem &#40;pixels per em&#41;. This does correspond to points in
    classical Mac-speak, but the conversion from ppem to points involves multiplying
    by 3/4 for classical Windows-speak. That is to say, 12 ppem equals 12 point on
    Mac, but 9 point on Windows. If you want to optimize something for &#34;12 point
    display&#34; on both Mac and Windows, you need to optimize both the 12 and 16
    ppem sizes. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'
