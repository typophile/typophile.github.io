  body: There&#39;s a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/goudy-handtooled/"
    target="_blank">Goudy Handtooled</a> font but it doesn&#39;t include an Italic.
    So the highlight must have been created by hand.

  body: It&#39;s not italic, it&#39;s just slanted. Italic looks totally different.
    I think you&#39;re right about the hilite being hand-drawn. It&#39;s not even
    consistent &#40;compare the e to the other letters&#41; and Goudy Handtooled&#39;s
    hilite is on the left.

  body: BTW, Scully, you won&#39;t get much help here looking for &#34;FREE&#34; versions
    of commercial fonts. Many of the experts here are in the font business &#40;that&#39;s
    how come we know so much about fonts&#41;. You might as well go to a bank and
    ask them if they know anywhere to get counterfeit money.

  body: Mark, you even have to pay to get Monopoly money. Scully think of type as
    an investment in a tool you will use over and over again. Like a pencil or a pen
