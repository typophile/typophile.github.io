body: 'Background <BR>The high level problem I am trying to calculate the width of
  a line of text for a given font. I am generating a dynamic PDF using fpdf.org&#39;s
  tool. FPDF utilizes PHP files among other things to generate the PDF. I can use
  this PDF to generate the length of a line of text given the definition. I&#39;ve
  provided two sample definitions below, one for Arial and one for Amazon &#40;a script
  font&#41;. <BR> <BR>Question <BR>My problem is I want to make sure I&#39;m understanding
  what all of these variables are first. I don&#39;t understand what the following
  variables are:  <BR>flags  <BR>ut  <BR>up  <BR>stemV  <BR>As you can see from the
  images below, Arial isn&#39;t really caluclating correctly, but Amazon is. The reason
  I don&#39;t think Arial is calculating correctly is because the ration between the
  EM Square =2692 and the EM Width &#40;width of an U.C. &#34;M&#34;&#41; =833 be
  SO far apart. Am I misinterpretting the numbers and/or variables? <BR> <BR>FOR DETAILS

  body: Hey, all. Abbey&#39;s a friend of mine, and when she asked about this particular
    issue I heartily recommended that she post her questions on Typophile, bragging
    about the immense intellect found here... Can anyone offer her some direction
    on this? &#40;see her link for more information&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'This is a bit heavy for me. <BR>Certainly Arial&#39;s 2692 is suspicious;
    could it be a value for the absolute maximum vertical span of the font? Meaning
    the highest a glyph in the font goes plus the lower another glyph goes? So this
    value might not be the same as the nominal em height, used for setting your typical
    line. <BR> <BR>Also: would it matter if Arial is a TT font while Amazon in a PS?
    <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I&#39;m way outta my league here, but I noticed this: <BR> <BR>When I look
    at the metrics of Arial, my Descent and CapHeight are -434 and 1466 -- based on
    a 2048 UPM grid. Those are exactly propotional with yours &#40;-212 and 716&#41;,
    assuming translation to a 1000 UPM grid. However, the Ascent is off &#40;905 translates
    to 1853 on a 2048 UPM, while the value in Arial is 1491&#41;. <BR> <BR>The character
    widths listed in your data also translate spot on to a 1000 UPM grid. &#40;E.g.,
    the width of J is 500 as opposed to 1024.&#41; <BR> <BR>However, when I add up
    the WinAscent, WinDescent, and LineGap values, I get 2595. Kinda close to the
    wierd 2692 value, but no cigar.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps the font&#39;s UPM is being
    converted, but there are some funky glitches? <BR> <BR>Now that I&#39;ve offered
    no real help, I&#39;m outta here ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>'
