body: "<i>&#8220;It is my hope that this fragment will interest typophiles, historians
  of the printed word as well as those with an interest in Belgian sandwich-making
  in the 1950s, about which subject there is still a great deal to explore.&#8221;</i>
  &#0151; from the Preface \r\n<BR>\r\nWhat do Stanley Morison, the Fell types, egg
  sandwiches and literary hoaxes have in common? You&#8217;ll find out in \"Stanley
  Morison&#8217;s Egg-Sandwich Exegesis,\" a parody of the twentieth century&#8217;s
  greatest typographic historian. <!--break--> As you can guess from this description,
  the book was published for a very . . . <i>select</i> audience. In a fit of optimism,
  we printed 100 copies. For anyone who enjoys a good literary hoax and a bit of fun
  at a great writer&#8217;s expense, this book is sure to delight. Check out http://infernopress.blogspot.com
