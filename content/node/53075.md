body: "This is inspired by the artist Joseph Kosuth; specifically his pieces labeled
  \"art as idea.\" (http://www.diacenter.org/KOS/images/kosuth.jpg) He would present
  the definition of \"Art\" or \"Nothing\" or various other words and this would be
  his art piece. Effectively, he questioned the conventional notion of art.\r\n\r\nI
  like this piece because according to the guests in my house or just on my mood,
  the canvases can be switched to say \"Is this art(?)\" \"Art is this\" or the other
  combinations. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/art1_4854.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/_MG_4750_6735.png]This

  body: "Joseph Beuys? Chris Burden? Anyone can be shot in the arm with a .22. Bullshit.
    Electrocute himself? Crucify himself to a VW? He is on par with Carolee Scheenmann.
    Get off  your ass and be a real artist. Stop bitching and make yourself someone
    that is respected.\r\n\r\nThe piece I did is for my own enjoyment. Not to make
    a point. Do something real. Do something that will make people think. The only
    group I cant think of is the Guerrilla Girls. \r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com"
