  preferably something that can work well in a news-ish format.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Will"

  body: Since Textra has a Gill Sans kinda look, you might consider a Gill serif face,
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/joanna/" target="_blank">Joanna</a>.
    The x-heights appear to be pretty close (which is important when mixing typeface
    families together).
