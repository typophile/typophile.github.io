body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI have been working with the bolding action in Fontlab, and
  have noticed a strange inconsistency.\r\n\r\nIf I bold the horizontal and vertical
  dimensions, with 'Keep Glyph Dimensions,' the uppercase stays the same height but
  the lowercase ascenders and descenders get shorter.\r\n\r\nIf I paste the same contours
  into an UPPERCASE glyph slot, they keep the same dimensions.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug,
  a setting, or some sort of error on my part?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback!\r\n\r\nJ"
