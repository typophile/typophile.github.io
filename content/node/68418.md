body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on the redesign of a web application used in the chemistry
  industry. Lots of screens display chemical formulas next to the name of the formula
  itself.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a correct font stack is important to my opinion, especially
  when lots of these formulas are displayed in a table column. The wrong typeface
  could slow down the reading process dramatically, or worse make some character combinations
  completely unreadable.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm currently looking at is how readable subscripts
  are at certain sizes, and if the typeface contains troublesome characters (eg: lowercase-l
  compared to uppercase-i). Based on this [[http://media.24ways.org/2007/17/fontmatrix.html|font
  matrix]], I found that Trebuchet may be a good choice&mdash;it seems to be the only
  one where the lowercase-l having has a curved end.\r\n\r\nTrebuchet is widespread,
  which makes it a good candidate. What I don't like is all the other incongruities
  which I think make it look not very professional.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>
  do you think I'm using the good approach?</li>\r\n<li> do you have better a recommendation
  than Trebuchet?</li>\r\n<li> or if not, what other typefaces would you suggest in
  the stack, should Trebuchet be missing on the user's platform?</li>\r\n<li> and
  finally, is there any typeface that would complement it well and be better suited
  for setting texts with a professional tone?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI hope it all makes
  sense and I welcome any suggestion. Thanks in advance."

  body: "Looking at your criteria, I'm wondering if you've ruled out a monospaced
    font? It wouldn't be good for the web page as a whole, but would it be possible
    to use just for the formulas?  Andale Mono is as prevalent as Trebuchet and differentiates
    between I, 1, and l. It presumably matches well with Verdana or other Microsoft
    web fonts.  You could then include Bitstream Vera Mono/Sans (or a variant like
    Deja Vu) for Linux users. I've never tried to set chemical formulas, so I don't
    know how that would work.\r\n\r\nst"

    all wrong.\r\n\r\nAndale Mono seems to be missing from Windows installations though,
    but definitely I will explore this route.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your
    suggestion."

    Something to note is that Andale Mono is also available as part of the core web
    fonts released by Microsoft way back when, so it's even freely available to those
    running Linux (or any other computer that doesn't have it) if they choose to install
    it.\r\n\r\nst"
