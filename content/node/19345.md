  body: "It might disarm those kinds of replies if you describe the type of font characteristics,
    and say, \"sort of like Bodega, which my client, a poor non-profit organization,
    can't pay for.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a very high concentration of people who make
    their living with fonts here, so free stuff is kind of threatening, and a sore
    subject with some. \r\n\r\nI know some musicians who are in a similar situation
    where a trend was happening when clubowners were just playing canned music rather
    than paying live musicians. I don't know where that issue stands these days. But
    art usually suffers as a result of natural tendancies toward economic savings."

  body: "Gosh golly, mpolino, I don't think Geoff was being snooty. If you are in
    fact a working (graphic) designer, you might not find it so hard to understand
    that type designers also need to make an honest living from their hard work. And
    hey, if your client doesn't want to pay for good fonts and is willing to settle
    for free ones, s/he might have to settle for the lower quality that comes with
    that choice, i.e., missing lowercase characters. Free stuff has a price, too.\r\n\r\n<em>I(
    am thinking I could switch to gill or clearface of something like that and my

    NOT a case to use a  free font that is derived from Bodega Sans. If your client
    can't afford Bodega, perhaps you could suggest a cheaper alternative (similar
    but not derivative) or a font from your library that could work. However if your
    client insists on Bodega Sans specifically, you should tell them that it is worth
    $648 bucks and perhaps you could educate them why fonts are so darned \"expensive*\".\r\n\r\n*
    They aren't really. ;^P\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ricardo, I took so long to type, but you
    got my point across nicely. Thanks."

    body: "Listen fellas, \r\nI am new to this forum and it seemed like I got a quick
      response that was suggecting that I am some hack who likes free stuff.  For
      that I apologize.  I have the utmost respect for the talent it takes to create
      a beautiful typeface, please don't think otherwise. I deal with the same problem
      every day with clients who want great design for a minimal price.  I certainly
      did not mean to get off on the wrong foot here.  I will take the advice and
      be more careful of the way I word my posts from now on. Please forgive me, I
      was so glad to have found this site and it is way too early for sour grapes.
      That is all and thank you for the help.\r\nMpolino\r\nP.S. For the record, I
      was suggesting the other typefaces because they were out of my own collection
      that I paid out the arse for. :)"

    don't have to be limited to $648 or nothing -- there are always less expensive
    alternatives in between those two extremes -- but Geoff and Stephen have already
    said it, and it looks like you can get at least a few weights of Bodega for less
    than you thought. Good luck!\r\n\r\nGeoff, you're welcome. Cheers!"

    for both the Bodega Sans and Bodega Serif families, complete, with all the small
    caps and alternates. Sans alone is $324. Price is between FB's 1-computer and
    5-computer license for same product. Also, as pointed out, fonts.com sells singles,
    at the same price as FB for a single-computer license. \r\n\r\nIf someone needs
    a font, and has a budget, it will be worth their effort to explore all the options.
    Many of the large retailers offer singles."
