  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A recent medical study compared subjects spending the same amount of time in front of a computer: one group did so with relatively few interruptions, the other splitting the time into smaller segments. Those who spent long periods seated at the computer had a worse record for heart conditions, etc.</p>
<p>And today another study in the news, comparing sitting with standing. Needless to say, you&rsquo;re better off standing.  (Winston Churchill, he of the cigars, brandy, and 90-year lifespan, is the poster boy for standing — he wrote all his many books standing, and pacing, at a lectern.)</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re inclined to hunker down on a font (or whatever) for many hours at a time, beware.</p>
<p>I can also add my personal experience. I always thought I was pretty fit—worked out regularly, ate sensibly, good body/mass index. But last year I had a coronary problem (thankfully fixed with a stent), which I now attribute to all those dusk-to-dawn sessions at the computer.</p>
<p>So my advice, take lots of breaks. And get your 8 hours sleep.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t know how much is from sitting in front of a computer (before that a drawing board) or just bad family history on my part. In 1995 (at age 51), I had a quadruple bypass and in 2007, I had 4 stents put in after a minor heart attack.  Having said that, I am the first male member of my family to live beyond the age of 55. Thanks to modern medicine. My older brother had his first heart attack at 39 died at 51, my father at 55, his father at 52 and even his mother at 48. All were heart related. I still do my fair share of 16 hour design sessions in front of the computer but I don&rsquo;t have anywhere near the stamina I did even 5 years ago.  I just completely loose track of time when I am working and often forget to eat.</div>

<p>One problem about using a computer is that a lot of your distractions from work are on the computer also, so you might be having a break from working but you are still sitting in the same place. I don&rsquo;t spend much time with a computer as I draw on paper, and breaks from that tend to involve doing things in the garden or going for a swim. Also, I work part-time in a bookshop so I am always standing there, although that is a possible cause of some of the foot problems I have.</p>

<p>Studies over the past year or so have shown that there&rsquo;s no magic chair&hellip;it&rsquo;s the act of sitting that&rsquo;s hurting us. So, standing, at least for part of the day, is going to be a good thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Standing is better than sitting, but frankly I&rsquo;m a bit dubious about that first study mentioned. Standing provides very minimal exercise, and it certainly isn&rsquo;t the kind of aerobic exercise that benefits the heart. I wonder if maybe the study just found a correlation, rather than an actual cause-and-effect relationship.</p>
<p>If the two groups in the study were identical in every respect other than the frequency of standing, the only medical connections I can see offhand might be 1) a possible reduction in blood clots that can be caused by long periods of sitting (deep venous thrombosis), or 2) a reduction in pressure ulcers (often called &ldquo;bed sores&rdquo;) which are caused by remaining in the same position for long periods of time, and can sometimes lead to more serious health problems, especially with folks who already have health problems (elderly, diabetic, paralyzed, etc).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, standing is a good idea. I&rsquo;m just a bit dubious that standing, by itself, can be statistically linked to a reduction in cardiac disease.</p>

The workplace of J. W. Goethe in Weimar, around 1790. It is called Reitsitz, e.g. ‘horse chair’.
([[http://www.konferenz-kultur.de/mitglieder/klassik_stiftung_weimar_galerie.php?we_lv_ct_ImageGallery=image%2F*&amp;we_lv_ws_ImageGallery=224&amp;we_lv_se_ImageGallery=0&amp;we_lv_start_ImageGallery=4&amp;we_lv_pend_ImageGallery=6&amp;we_lv_pstart_ImageGallery=0|source]])</p>
<p>For myself, I can’t do intensive font or layout work standing 5 or 8 hours.</p>
<p>But I find conciously practised brakes beneficial. 
Going out to the baker’s, or to the Biergarten (by feet of course).</p>

<p>So is a dog, and they don&rsquo;t cause cancer. I take a lot of breaks to walk the dogs. I also break to go to the gym, and when I have a lot of reading to do, I do it at the gym. Hell, you can even proof fonts at the gym. A guy at one gym I went to was a policy wonk and a serious weightlifter; he spent two hours a night working out and between sets would write policy papers on his Blackberry. He even lugged a bag of reference materials around the gym with him.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad to not have a drivers license and car. This means I have to do a lot more walking or cycling. This a blessing really, cause it gives me time to think, get out of the house and get some exercise. Moving at a human speed gives me a lot less stress and just means I have to take time to do things, which is good.</p>
<p>I often sit behind my computer, but i do notice that does not do me good, especially when the work is inneffective. My hands and feet get cold, my eyes get strained, generally feeling rather stiff. It is really hard to develop a new idea behind my computer. It is much better to see it as a tool for realising ideas, rather than getting them, though sometimes time pressure forces me too.</p>
<p>I love to get out and go for a walk for 1-2 hours, it just clears my head, gets the blood flowing, fresh air&hellip; I can recommend it to everyone!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I often use a gym ball as a chair, it&rsquo;s not as good as standing, but at least it keeps me moving. It&rsquo;s good for the back and tummy muscles. The downside is sometimes aching achilles tendons from all that bouncing.</p>
<p>As for getting enough sleep:
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8500013/Seven-hours-sleep-keeps-the-brain-sharp.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8500013/Seven-hours-sleep-keeps-the-brain-sharp.html</a>
Too little sleep affects your brain function.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a car either, but as I work from home, I don&rsquo;t get as much &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; exercise as I&rsquo;d like, especially when I&rsquo;m busy and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be time to go for a walk or a cycle. Even the supermarket is almost too close!
When I get on the move I use steps, rarely lifts or escalators, and use the bike or feet whenever possible. It&rsquo;s not enough, but better than nothing. A standing desk would be good.</p>

<p>Since I am self employed my work habits are quite erratic. 9-5 (or whatever) is something I can&rsquo;t even understand (designing for me is more a way of life, a way to experience life). So I can understand that designing a typeface must be at times quite brutal, time must seem to pass by with the course of night and day.</p>

<p>And to clarify the original studies, the issue is that sitting 8 hours a day is damaging to our bodies. We might mountain climb for 8 hours a day as well, but that does not make up for sitting 8 hours a day, unfortunately.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Over a decade ago, I put my drafting table on risers, made the surface flat, and put my monitor on it. I use a Steelcase task chair (a desk chair that rises higher than a regular desk chair). So, I can sit or stand. I prefer standing.</p>
<p>My dad had his first bypass at 53. It was a quadruple. He&rsquo;s the first commercial airline pilot in the U.S. ever to be allowed to fly again after multiple bypass surgery. At 77, he had another bypass&ndash;this time a double with a valve replacement. At 82, dad&rsquo;s still going strong, flying sailplanes, which he began at age 70.</p>
<p>My mom smoked for 47 years, then in 1996, woke up 3 days in a row with pain in her chest. My dad told her it was her heart. She said it couldn&rsquo;t be, because she&rsquo;d always had low cholesterol and clear x-rays. But on the third day of waking up like that, she had my dad take her to the hospital. The admitting physician said, &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t usually have had pain like that without some damage to the heart, but I&rsquo;m not a cardiologist.&rdquo; After a cardiologist ran tests, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you did it, but you beat the odds. No damage to your heart, but you have one artery blocked 90%, and one 55%.&rdquo; Angioplasty took care of it. My mom asked how it is possible for her to have great cholesterol numbers, but have blockage. The doctor replied that they hadn&rsquo;t connected the dots yet, but had a staggering amount of information pointing to a link between smoking and heart disease in people with good cholesterol. Remember, this was &lsquo;96&ndash;they probably have it figured out now.</p>
<p>We all have to go some time from some cause, butwhy rush it, or make the quality of our own lives less than what it could be? That said, I suppose we all have our vices, too. I like ice cream a little too much.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently had a near-fatal heart attack even though at his last checkup his cholesterol levels were okay and he&rsquo;d passed a stress test.</p>
<p>His doctor said that screening tests like checking cholesterol, having a stress test, etc. are very useful but are not 100% reliable as predictors.</p>
<p>I believe the only definitive test for blockages is a coronary catheterization, which is an invasive procedure done in a hospital, and is normally not used unless a serious problem is suspected.</p>
