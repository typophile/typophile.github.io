body: "Welcome to the third CheapProFonts newsletter of 2009 - not a regular newsletter
  with various reworked fonts, but a presentation of the first part of a large project
  of NEW fonts I'm working on. :)\r\n\r\nThe \"Geometry Pro\" family has been designed
  to be the final word in purely geometric fonts, and this rounded \"Soft\" sub-family
  is the ultimate web 2.0 style font collection. ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-09-03_5074.gif]<!--break-->\r\n\r\nEven
  though it is strictly geometric (as drawn with a compass and a ruler fixed to 90
  and 45 degree angles) it is not slavishly modular: letters have differing widths,
  and the sidebearings, spacing and kerning has been finely adjusted to create smooth
  text.\r\nThe Soft family contains 3 weights each with 6 variants = 18 fonts + an
  additional FREE variant for you to enjoy!\r\n\r\nALL fonts of course have our usual
  large multilingual character set.\r\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality
  OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring
  more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\nCheck
  our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger

  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!"
