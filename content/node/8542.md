  here the terminal of strokes of letters B, R, maybe must have coherenc with all
  set to give more visual unity. <BR>I like very much of or M but how far you gone
  apply that descentration of the parts of the letters, you used in more aplications?
  <BR>This source have very potencial! '

    Universe vs. Helvetica. <BR> <BR>I love what you have. Finish it up and get it
    out there. One comment. I&#39;d look at the stencilish B and R and make it more
    cosistant with the rest. '

  body: ' I made one of those &#34;remarkably similar&#34; fonts, called OGRA, and
    also found a few other fonts that follow the same idea after it was published
    by fountain in 1997. I think your design is way more interesting then mine. Eventhough
    I&#39;m not a fan of stencils, you should maybe continue with that style in the
    other letters to keep your design further apart from the other, similar fonts. '

    one solid, and one that explores the stencil theme. It would double the versatility

    on the &#34;M&#34; cause there is only one. and the&#34;R&#34; and &#34;B&#34;
    <BR>have to many.  i would close the top of the &#34;R&#34; &amp; &#34;B&#34;
