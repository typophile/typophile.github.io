  body: The Solotype Catalog shows it as Modula, but that fact is not particularly

  body: "We have had this come up a number of times, and the typeface seems to pre-date
    the Emigre font. The only digital version I know offhand was by NovelFonts and
    is called Obbsidda.It was distributed by Tiger Direct in the mid-1990's in the
    Expresiv Ornate font collection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
