  ever need to identify a type face isn't it?!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am looking for a particular
  typeface. I'm sure you've all seen it, it is used in a lot of science fiction contexts
  (it is the typeface used on the battle star galactica dvd boxes underneath the title)
  and I think the commonly found Terminator 2 font is a mod of it, however the the
  \"A\"'s are most definitely very different. I'll post an image of it too just to
  clear up any doubts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontExample_5401.jpg]"

    2 already. \r\n\r\nI watched Season 1 through 3 via the iTunes Music Store. But
    I guess that won't be an option for the tv-movie in November or the fourth season,
    if Univesal really does pull all of its tv shows from iTunes :( \r\n\r\nMaybe
    I'll be able to see Galactica on UK television while I'm living there\u2026"

    and saw the Season 1 finale a couple of nights ago.  :-)\r\n\r\nKick-arse show
    is right! So many good things about it. And it really draws you in."
