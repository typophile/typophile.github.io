body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI don't have an image of my requested font; please let me explain:\r\n\r\nThe
  font I am looking for is very similar to Cooper Black. It's kind of a variation
  of it done by a famous font designer (whose name I also can't remember). It was
  so close that a non-designer probably couldn't tell it from Cooper Black.\r\n\r\nI
  read about this font 2 or three years ago when it was introduced, and it is available
  online somewhere. I don't think the name is anything similar to Cooper...\r\n\r\nCan
  you name the font?\r\n\r\nWould be just great ;-)\r\n\r\nTIA\r\nHuggy"
