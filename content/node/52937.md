  clickable back to the home page? \r\n\r\nI know I can follow the breadcrumbs, but
  the clickability of the big red icon was so much more user-friendly and web smart
  (not to mention, best-practices compliant). Punchcut, please restore this great
  feature!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    get fixed.

  body: <em>@Jason</em> Those badges indicate that a user has donated to Typophile.
    (For what it's worth, I donated about a year ago and never got around to adjusting
    my avatar.)

    longer linking and this was not something we did purposefully. When changing the
    header, something got *lost* and we are hoping to fix it ASAP (but it probably
    won't happen until we return from the holidays :/)\r\n\r\nThanks"
