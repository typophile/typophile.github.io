  appropriate to ask for type and color recommendation on this forum if I provide
  general info, like who I'm targeting site for, what is suppose to aspire to, etc.?\r\n\r\nIf
  it's appropriate, on what subforum may I do it?\r\n\r\nIf it's not appropriate,
  can you please link me to useful info I might find on this forum, specifically where
  should I start? I wouldn't call myself complete newbie concerning type (I'm aware
  of font types, and basic parameters like X height, etc), but I'm not far from.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Surely there will be someone that will tell you to hire a professional designer...
    ;-)\r\nAnd it will be for a reason, especially if by \u201Cmy personal photographic
    website\u201D you mean \u201Cmy website as a professional photographer\u201D.\r\nBut,
    being an almost self taught graphic designer myself, I can understand the need
    to try by yourself.\r\nTwo little bits of advice:\r\n1. Always start with black
    & white (and, dealing with photography, you can well stick with it).\r\n2. The
    easiest and most trivial idea you can tinker with is the identity of form between
    the \u201CO\u201D (as in phOtO) and the lens (iris/pupil). So you could search
    for a typeface with a perfectly rounded O, or substitute the O with a circle.\r\n\r\nAnd
    don\u2019t forget to submit your efforts to the Critique section of the forums!
    :-)"

  body: "well, I'm aware of how much work is behind branding design, that's why I
    asked first, because I could even realize if this type of request were forbidden.\r\n\r\nActually,
    so far I'm enjoying the learning process behind all this and being it's really
    a personal project(it won't be source of income anytime soon :)), I like having
    control over every aspect.\r\n\r\nThanks for your advice, I actually already have
    logo that's stylized eye, once I got the whole thing done, I will post it for
    critique. This seems more acceptable, right, asking for direction for work in
    progress, than asking for the whole thing from ground up?\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    tip about \"o\"!"

  body: thanks for your interest, I'll post more info later, including examples of
    my work, and logo I've been playing with, to get more input on what type might
    be appropriate.

    think that's enough info for now...\r\n\r\nAny help and input appreciated!"
