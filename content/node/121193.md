body: "Hello, I have this old wine label from the Ahr area in Ahrweiler / Germany.
  It is from around 1910-1940 and has several blackletter fonts. The big one I already
  identified as Maximilan (3rd from top). For the other ones I have no idea. Does
  anyone have a guess? Especially the first and the Italic (or rather Oblique) ones
  would be helpful. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with your call of Rudolf Koch's Maximilian (Gotisch) which he produced
    for Gebr. Klingspor in  1914-1917. Several revivals of varying quality and legitimacy.
    Consider the version by Delbanco http://www.delbanco-frakturschriften.de/artikeldetails/kategorie/gotisch/artikel/ds-maximilian.html
    and  Gerhard Helzel's revival. Alter Littera has a version under development that,
    based on their other blackletters, should be of excellent quality http://www.alterlittera.com/al_htm/oldtype.htm
    \r\nAs for the boxy letters in the top line, perhaps they are also by Koch and
    or Klingspor? I have seen several similar attempts to simplify blackletter pre-WW
    I, but I don't recall this precise design.\r\nIf there is a digital version, the
    best place to start might be to go through Gerhard Helzel's specimen book http://www.romana-hamburg.de/Fraktur.htm\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Might be worth doing a careful run down this extensive list of blackletter
    and hybrid typefaces dated around 1900 http://vau-ef-be.beepworld.de/schriftliste1.htm
    For example, consider Germania (normal, halbfett) Heinrich (Heinz) K\xF6nig AG

    but not quite there.\r\nMight be something closer on the list.\r\nDon"

  body: "Alright, thank you for the hints! I found a decent (and free) version of
    Maximilian here: http://www.steffmann.de\r\n\r\nFor the top one, I searched all
    your links but I only found ones that are about 60-70% close. But it looks so
    familiar \u2026 "

  body: "I was aware of the Steffmann Maximilian but did not mention it because in
    my opinion, based on examination of quite a few of Mr. Steffmann's other fonts,
    the digital outlines are probably stolen from the work of another digital fontmaker.
    Mr. Steffmann's practice was to take an existing digital font, add additional
    characters, do some minor tinkering, and share the result as his own work. Hardly
    fair to the person who made the font, and an abuse of the idea of a \"free\" font.\r\nDon"
