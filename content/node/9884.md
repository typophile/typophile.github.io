  body: I would think if you don&#39;t have too many words, you could make your own
    letters and they might be more interesting. A razor blade and scotch tape should
    do it.

  body: Of course, Dan, but Steven asked for the name of the font,  <BR>not a way
    to mimick this title. This is the Type Identification  <BR>Board after all, not
    the How To Do It Yourself Board. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Yves people are trying to reach an end and maybe the thought of doing something
    themselves didn&#39;t cross there minds. I ment no offense just a suggestion.
    You IDed this font. Sometimes its just easier for someone to just recreate a dingbat
    in Illustrator or Photoshop.
