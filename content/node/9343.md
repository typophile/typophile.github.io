    target="_blank">Gridnik</a> doesn&#39;t have a bold version and is not as wide,
    <BR>but otherwise, it matches.

  body: font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I actually don&#39;t know where
    this came from.  I saw it in another &#40;lesser&#41; &#34;please ID this font&#34;
    forum posting and thought it was cool myself so I thought I&#39;d take a shot.  I
    could use something like this. <BR><br> <BR>Also, I actually think the lighter
    weight numbers are probably another font entirely.  But I&#39;m not an expert.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, is Gridnik easily purchaseable?  That website is on the uninformative
    side.  I did email the company.&#60;/font&#62;

    stretched.
