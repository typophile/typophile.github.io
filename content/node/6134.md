body: Hi <BR> <BR>This is actually for a five star hotel in Mauritius. They wanted
  a logo that reflects the concept of unity, harmony in diversifiation as is the multicultural
  Mauritius. By mixing both uppercase and lowercase I wanted to convey this message.
  I actually like the &#39;i&#39; that i think keep on altering from being a candle,
  the Indian &#39;Bindi&#39; &#40;forehead decoration&#41;  to even a drop of water.  <BR>
  <BR>Although I like the joyful &#39;Es&#39;, I am not really sure about the first
  one that looks out of its place with an awkward spacing, but the client saw it and
  like the &#39;E&#39; in particular, my boss doesn&#39;t have any objection to let
  it go. <BR> <BR>What do you guys think? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jean-Lou <BR> <BR><img

  body: I do also think that the first &#39;e&#39; really looks out of place, like
    you already stated.. <BR><i>Maybe you could modify / lower the end &#39;swash&#39;
    of the &#39;e&#39; so it fits nicely below the &#39;a&#39;..</i>

  body: Jean-Lou, if any type designer sees what you did with the first e they will
    kill you. That character is only to be used at the end of a word. Also I don&#39;t
    like the relationship between the caps and lowercase. Use normal capitals, its
    a 5 star hotel not an amusement park. The letter spacing is terrible, but fix
    the first problems first.

  body: Daniel might have sounded harsh, but he&#39;s right on all accounts. Also,
    there seems to be A LOT of space between Beau Rivage and Mauritius. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: 'Thanks guys <BR> <BR>Thanks to confirm the &#39;E&#39;. There was no reason
    why it had to be use it like that I&#39;ll swap to the regular &#39;E&#39; instead.
    <BR> <BR>Daniel: I should kill myself first for having left it among my proposals.
    As for the caps I find it relevant, it gives a contemporary and more relax feel
    to the logo - a fusion of conservative and progressive reflecting the Group personnality.
    It is quite a dynamic hotel, lots of animations. <BR> <BR>As for the spacing I
    am working on it, I admit its a headache to tune that. Is it the a,g,e? <BR> <BR>'

    dining. Five star. What you are responding to is a trend not an institution, think
    20 years from now. Think Tiffanys. '
