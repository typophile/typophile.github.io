  body: "I'm a fan of the Trump Mediaeval Italic ampersand. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trump-mediaeval/italic/glyphs/528505/7\r\n\r\nI
    was wondering whether many people won't recognise that style of ampersand though?\r\n\r\nThe
    'et' is clear, but have most people forgotten that connection? Do most people
    only 'get' them from context? I sent an image to one of my friends with only that
    ampersand in but he didn't know what it meant until I sent another one showing
    \"Jack & Jill\", where it was recognised in context."

  body: "The french ampersand comes from a contraction of an /e an a /t to get the
    /et (and &) in english. That said, all aesthetic choice is open and up to the
    designer. You could find the way I've drawn my ampersand in other typeface too
    (Meridien italic for instance). Also, an ampersand is called \u201Cesperluette\u201D
    in French, but only few people knows about it. Everybody calls the ampersand key
    \ \u201Cet\u201D according to its common pronounciation. \r\n\r\nMore to read
