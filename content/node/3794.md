body: Hello, I am sending you a typeface &#40;unnamed so far&#41; that I have designed.
  It is the first time I undergo a project such as this and I am overall quite inexperienced
  in the field of typeface design. Because of this, I would greatly appreciate any
  comments you may have; from the simplest details to the most advanced observations
  - all will be of great value to me at this point. <BR>  <BR>My intention is for
  this to be a modern style font, corresponding to a Demi version. I am not sure I
  will ever create it

  body: 'This is lovely. One thing: Your X and x have the top-heavy illusion. Move
    the two strokes so that they cross at the visual center which is slightly above
    center, making the top ends somewhat closer than the bottom ends. You may be able
    to leave the capital X as it is, but for the lowercase x it needs doing.'

  body: See the little wiggle in the top of the a &amp; the bottom of the e &amp;
    g? What about putting that on the top of the s, the &amp; z, 2 &amp; 4? Also the
    crossbar of the E. I would like to see the 3 with a curve on the bottom - it might
    look sweeter. The cap J really bugs me. It looks comic book like where the rest
    of the glyphs are maybe a combination of routed-out desk nameplate &amp; something
    arts &amp; crafts... What about making the bottom of the 3 end abruptly?
