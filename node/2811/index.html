		<div class="commentbody">James, I agree with you as far as perception is concerned. But thats where it ends. Think of the labour. There is more to this issue than just thinking: 'There it is! I have a nice set of weights.'  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously if you are making two or three faces for a font then you may be able to wing things a bit - but what about 20 weights? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You might want to try to automate production. Then check results of course. (I am not advocating using blind dogma to replace the evidence of your senses) You might save maybe 100 or even 1000+ hours of work! Also you might have more time to critically look at the work - as opposed to slogging away. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, a theory which explains why something looks good &amp; is helpful in general is worthwhile to know about - even if you decide to leave it behind for some reason another. Ever heard of the 'golden mean'? I don't think it's the be all &amp; end all. But it can be helpful in some cases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will post some experiments I have done over the next few days &amp; explain my current &amp; probably naive thinking a bit more.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If only I had more math in highschool! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant?

		<div class="commentbody">John, That helps alot - I had a feeling that there might be a way to steamline the process of looking &amp; comparing the possibilities - even if it doesn't give finnished results.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you have any suggestions for sources of python scripts? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An aside about MM fonts: I think that MM instances are generated using a linear process. When you make a MM font you have to decide as the maker where the 50% mark is &amp; if you will have additional defined midpoints &amp; if so, where they are  - which lets you establish a sort of curve. Not a true curve but something more like one.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a user of MM font you have to generate a font &amp; decide what values it will have and if the maker has only two extremes &amp; no strategically placed midpoints built in to cause sort of psudo curve then you might think a 75% value is going look like 75% - which it isn't. Linear scaling does not equal optical scaling. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll talk more about that in another posting because I see MM as (maybe) flawed when it comes to generating weights in a purely theoretical sense both with &amp; without midpoints because it is a linear process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is more to this but I am going to hold off for now. MM per se is really a side issue &amp; not too important in a practical sense at this point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James, Sorry if I came off as snotty. I didn't mean to be. I just thought your answer was incomplete. I see now that theory isn't your thing. Fair enough. I don't 'trust' theories either. I don't reject them out of hand either. Dogma is a bad thing because it closes your eyes to your own authentic aethetic perception. Dogam about rejecting all theories is equally dubious in my opinion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I seeking a way out of *all* the labour? No.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of it? - Definitely.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I dig a ditch I might choose a shovel rather than a spoon. Does that make me less nobel or my ditch less good because it took me 3 hours vs. 6 days to dig my ditch?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I want to avoid the drudgery that computers are good at so I can do what I hope am good at - looking &amp; judging.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end I think you are right that the eye has the be the final arbiter. I am admittedly new to this. I see that you are not. (Nice stuff BTW).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also see how doing most things yourself by hand &amp; not leaving it to machines is the only way to make really solid wothewhile stuff in nearly every case - even when making something like a handwriting font from scans.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand if I can look at lots of sets of weights made with different equations (&amp; therefore different weight curves) then I imagine I can do a better job of making multiple weights - particularly if there are lots &amp; lots of weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite apart from whether you want math in your font process - you could talk about which model of weights looks better to you; Porchez, DeGroot, someone else, or maybe your own weight system. And you could talk about why you think that. You could talk about how you decided to make the weights you made for Alfon.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could talk about really skinny or fat fonts &amp; why you don't make them - or haven't so far from what I can see on your web site. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This kind of info could be seen as a trade secret too I suppose&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you work in multiple weights much or are you concerned with middle/normal weight forms for the most part?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All, sorry this entry is so long winded. When I post some examples &amp; test images with the formulas behind them I am sure they will clarify what I am after &amp; why better than my typing here has for the past two postings.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What I have done so far to make sense of this issue is to take the sample I found on the De Groot page (See above with the arrows) &amp; measure the density of pixels that compose the arrow's horizontal lines. A black pixel is 100 units &amp; grey one might be worth between 1 &amp; 99 units. Two black pixels measure as '200'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I had estimated relative widths I looked for a rule or equation that could describe &amp; predict the changes that I saw from the thinest to the thickest.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rule that seemed to be used for weight increase was: take 1+1/3 of the weight of a charcter add it to get the target weight of the next charcter. In excel the formula is =Cx/3+Cx where C is the column &amp; x is the number of the starting weight.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this way 21 is converted to 28 &amp; so on. Not all number convert cleanly like this. For instance 28 becomes 37.33333&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because points in FontLab or Fontographer do not come in fractionally numbered positions some rounding must be done and an ideal curve/formula would therefore: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Provide a pleasing optical 'one step' increase. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Provide numbers that either were either whole or were as close to a whole number as possible eg 1.1 (1)is better than 1.4 &amp; 1.9 (2) is better than 1.5. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Provide a whole pixel em unit number at 9 or 12 points or whatever screen size you might be targeting. For the font I am working on now ( monoline ) that would be 100 em units for a target of 9 pixels on screen. This last point is irrelevant if you are making a font with no focus on screen rendering such as a display face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The em units I calculated using my hypothetically 'De Groot style' curve &amp; 1 as a base with every 2nd number sampled starting with 1 are <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1,2,3,6,10,18,32,56,100,177,315 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are also the rounded or clean numbers. The unrounded mathematical result is: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.333333333 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.777777778 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.37037037 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.160493827 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.21399177 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5.618655693 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7.491540924 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9.988721232 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13.31829498 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->17.75772663 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->23.67696885 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->31.56929179 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->42.09238906 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->56.12318541 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->74.83091388 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->99.77455184 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->133.0327358 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->177.3769811 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->236.5026414 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->315.3368552 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably none of these numbers match the Thesis fonts exactly either in terms of their actual ratios to each other. If I have sussed the formula he used that would be interesting especially since it yeilds mostly nice #s. I like the fact that it yields a 10 &amp; a 100 for instance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is what the rule/formula looks like as a curve charted in excel: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is the same formula rendered to screen using a cross &amp; circle as examples. I have4 used weights 1-177 for 10 weights:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My reaction to this curve is that it emphasizes the light &amp; dark too much in 10 steps. A flatter curve would be better. The steps do feel even though - that much is good. A smaller fraction than 1+1/3rd might give better results. It would be nice to sample every number too. It might be better to start with 2 or 3 or even 5 rather than 1. These are the ideas I will be testing next. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems like a golden mean ratio could be tried too. I have to look into it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I owned thesis I could measure it directly - but I don't. As you can see it wasn't really crucial to know what he did exactly to be able to start experimenting. I am not sure I like his formula so well that I would want to use it in any case. I mean I really like &amp; respect his stuff, but Porchez may have something in that crit.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also I'd rather work out my own rationale. It more fun, it's valid intellectual property ( if I was keeping it to myself ) and maybe it's even a noble kind of labour or something like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW : DeGroot actually provides three equations on his site but I have not been able to make anything out of it so far. If anbody else can explain them please let me know! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will do some additional experiments and post them if folks are interested - especially if I make something I like.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I could also post the my excel sheet somewhere if it could help anybody work out formulas/weight curves they like. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does my original question make better sense now? Am I just nuts?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you think a split curve would make better sense or give better results? eg: One curve for the bolds &amp; one for the ligher weights with a normal weight in the middle. If you think so, why? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks!</div>

Each new font require different way, just because the contrast is variable and some have Serifs, others not. Some need to be used in small size, so large counters in Black when others mostly for display. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't miss also that a real letter is not just a + or a circle. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When designing a Black, I say BLACK not b l a c k as in many case, most of the job is to achieve the perfect visual weight, not the mathematical weight: So a g lc will be very different than n. Same for the horizontal of a B or E compared to vertical of a N, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in Thin weight it will be more mathematical adjustment, as less contrast by definition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, when you interpolate such extrems, your regular or demi can suddenly appear to contrasted when x an y interpolation are same values. So, again some adjustment need to be made. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not also that an interpolate curve is not straight, the regular between thin and black is not at 50%! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here after some adjustement made for Anisette intermediate weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, Where was James' post? The one I referred to earlier? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jean Porchez, thanks for looking in!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope you have time to look closer at my arguement later. If you have anything else to say I would love to hear it - especially anything theoretical in nature, even it turns out that you, like James, reject outright using any sort of theory or math to design fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I think I can prove my basic point about curves in general if only because DeGroot clearly used a formula to make some *really* nice fonts &amp; clearly didn't use some sort of crude global process as James assumed I was inquiring about.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe, if I am fortunate, I can find a better curve than De Groot did &amp; show how an improved curve can work to make something really nice &amp; really functional.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I think finding a better curve will probably be easy.  Applying that curve in a sensitive, inteligent &amp; inspired manner will probably be much, much harder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using a formula for a major element such as acenders will probably be straightforeward. A modified set of formulas could probably be developed to handle many other aspects of develping a bold ( or light) face. Maybe a different curve can or should be invented for altering each major aspect of a font. I don't know if I will do it - but that it is possible to do &amp; that some mathematical process' can help a typographer's initial process' both seem obvious to me now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still wonder which aspects of DeGroot's face were subject to his formula. Maybe all of them were -  in some way. Maybe he will enlighten us. Wouldn't that be excellent?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll post to this thread if I find anything in my experiments that seems useful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If anybody owns a license to a thesis series font &amp; can hypothesize about the weights work for different aspects of the fonts that would be fun to hear about!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, without try change original Luc[as] view about his own theories: I have the feeling that the interpolation theory he published in 1995 (I remember clearly when he gave it to me during ATypI Barcelona) on his Thesis specimen is more a non serious thing and nice illustration than anything else. It need to be in the context of the specimen, nothing more and that case, the theory illustration work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Building mathematic methods and systems for typeface design is a really a funny idea!

		<div class="commentbody">JFP's post with Anisette sums up the reality of this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->situation. The Black is usually very different than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the thin. For instance, compare the shared stroke <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weights on a black to that of a thin. It's common to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slightly reduce the stroke weight on letters like e and a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the black but not in the thin. These irregularties will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in turn create less than perfect interpolations. This is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->where the labor comes in! I recomend coffee <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the mornings followed by green tea in the afternoons <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recently I've been using MM to create my intermediate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weights.

		<div class="commentbody">I share Eric's observations on creating accurate interpolations between Extra Thin and Black.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For that reason, I usually created the Xtra Thin and the Black separately and use less extreme masters for any interpolation. This started by creating heavy weights that were ultimately not heavy enough, and using extrapolation to create the beginnings of a black weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This extrapolation also helped create very light weights. I say helped because extrpolated outlines need a lot of additional labor to look good.</div>
