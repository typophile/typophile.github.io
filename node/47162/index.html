  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>A while back I read an article in the New York Times Magazine about the design of a new typeface for highway signs (“The Road to Clarity,” August 12, 2007). My area is engineering design, and the article inspired me to consider that typeface design might make a good educational example in “transdisciplinary design.” I’m interested in your input about the designer’s thought process in comparing several diverse concepts for a new typeface&ndash;either creating a new typeface or choosing from several alternatives.</p>
<p>From reading this forum and investigating other educational resources, I can identify some major parameters that can be varied in the design of a typeface. For the sake of the discussion, let’s consider serif typeface used for text in any of the various serif styles (inscriptional, Geralde, Transitional, Modern, etc.).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Parameters 
The parameters that can be changed would include x-height, color and stroke weight, spacing, stress angle, ascender and descender height, contrast, serif style, counter size, character width, etc. What else should this list include?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criteria
In designing a new typeface, what are the criteria or metrics that you use in evaluating different design concepts?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The criteria could be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative criteria would include legibility, readability, efficiency, etc. Qualitative criteria would include balance, aesthetics, etc. What other criteria or metrics do you consider? And for the qualitative ones, how do you “measure” or assess them?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Conflict
Can you think of aspects of type design in which there is potential “conflict” between the design characteristics? For example, I saw in one post this statement: “A good ‘bad example’ is Mrs Eaves: x-height is ideal for large setting, color is ideal for midrange setting, and spacing is ideal for small setting: three-way mismatch.” This is an example of the type of conflict that I’m referring to in which the three parameters conflict with each other in fulfilling the three objectives for setting at different sizes.</li>
</ol>
<p>(In some theories of engineering design, a good design is defined as one in which a solution is found to such conflicts, or in others the “level of inventiveness” is characterized by the degree to which the conflict is resolved.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Theories
What theories of legibility are you familiar with? Or what creative ideas have been put forth to adjust a typeface design to improve legibility? I’ve seen descriptions of several approaches to improve legibility: large x-height, the M-formula of William Addison Dwiggins, Evert Bloemsma’s emphasis of the tops of letterforms, the use of inktraps, and familiarity. What other novel theories have you seen to adjust letterforms to improve legibility?</li>
</ol>
<p>Regards, 
dt</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Linking to your 2 and 4, I would&rsquo;t say legibility or readability can be classed as quantitative criteria. I can perhaps see the possibility of user-testing or polling, returning some kind of quantitative data, but that&rsquo;d be pseudo-scientific at best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to read more of those theories you mention. Do you have references to them? I&rsquo;d love to hear other theories on quantifying legibility too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Q2. Criteria for evaluation</p>
<p>Reading speed is the most obvious measure of reading performance. Miles Tinker is perhaps best associated with using this measure with a huge number of typographic variables over 40 years of research. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legibility-Print-Miles-Tinker/dp/0813824508">http://www.amazon.com/Legibility-Print-Miles-Tinker/dp/0813824508</a></p>
<p>There are many other ways of measuring reading performance. Two that have been used in recent years for measuring typographic variables are time and distance threshold measures. A time threshold measure is measuring the minimal amount of time it takes to recognize text. Barbara Chaparro and her lab at Wichita State have done interesting work with this measure: <a href="http://www.surl.org/usabilitynews/92/legibility.asp">http://www.surl.org/usabilitynews/92/legibility.asp</a></p>
<p>The distance threshold measure measures the smallest visual angle (farthest distance) needed to recognize text. The Clearview Highway work that you read about in the New York Times Magazine uses this, as does the work by James Sheedy’s lab in discovering the letter superiority effect: <a href="http://hfes.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/hfes/hf/2005/00000047/00000004/art00009">http://hfes.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/hfes/hf/2005/00000047/00000004/art00009</a></p>
<p>Measuring the aesthetics of type is more challenging. Preference measures are the most typical measure (e.g. Rate how much you like this on a 1-7 scale; How much eye fatigue does this cause on a 1-7 scale, etc.). I’ve been involved with work on trying to develop better measures. One idea was to measure cognitive performance after the reading experience since cognitive performance is known to be altered by the enjoyment of the experience. This work is described in Issue 22 of Typo Magazine <a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=105">http://www.magtypo.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=105</a>, but doesn’t appear to be online. A short version appears in sidebar 1 of this article: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/5049">http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/5049</a>.</p>
<p>A second strategy was to start to understand the physiological causes of eye fatigue. This work appeared in the most recent issue of Eye magazine: <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/opinion.php?id=157&amp;oid=414">http://www.eyemagazine.com/opinion.php?id=157&amp;oid=414</a></p>
<p>Cheers, Kevin</p>
