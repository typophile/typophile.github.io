  type.  With Typekit, Font Squirrel, and Font Shop sporting webkits and iPhone apps
  using fonts for in postcards, etc., are licensing restrictions becoming less strict?
  Should my client be concerned about embedding type? '

    on the individual license. '

  body: Then you will need customized licensing. This means your client needs to discuss
    his intentions with the foundries from whom he wishes to license type and will
    have to pay for a different kind of license. I don't know of any EULA that allows
    this sort of thing within a standard EULA.

  body: "If the fonts are installed on the server and user-interaction causes server-based
    PDF creating application to embed the fonts and send the resulting PDF to the
    user then I think that falls well outside of the realm of a typical font EULA.

    standard EULA and would have to be negotiated with the foundry. '
