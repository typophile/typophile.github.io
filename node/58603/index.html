  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Yup, I said it – Portable toilet logo. The name of the company is UPTOWN RESTROOMS and they specialize in clean, spacious and pleasantly smelling portable toilets for weddings and corporate events. The logo should appeal to women as the bathrooms are mostly for them (hey guys can go anywhere). I'm rebranding them and would love some feedback as I'll be presenting the client in a couple of days. I've included 2 of my directions below. Thanks in advance.

My key words for the project are…

high-end
exclusive
clean
feminine

Perhaps the word restrooms should be smaller and a very, very simple font, as you already have two different fonts. Maybe a small serif?</div>

My initial reaction was that the second one is trying too hard to be classy. And old-style: I personally always find it a bit humorous if establishments try to look like they've been around forever, use a font reminiscent of 2 centuries ago, & even put the "since whenever" line in their logo &ndash; and then they've been around for what, 3 years? Seriously.

That said, I think the first one has good potential. It looks a bit more unusual but pleasantly surprising/surprised, especially with that Baskervillian high "p" &ndash; so nicely matching a client's reaction upon visiting/using a portable toilet that's actually nice :-). "Fresh" is a good adjective.
Hell, you might even try a heavy sans for the TOWN part. Or maybe not.
Most of all, I'm not sure about the "restrooms" either. It's too close to the "up" but not quite the same. I might try a wide-ish sans (think Gotham, or maybe something more classicist) in tracked-out all caps, not too large, not too heavy. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks you all for your input. The challenge for me is making the logo "feminine" without excluding the masculine completely (if that makes any sense).

altaira–thanks for your comments regarding the "Filosifia" direction. I've had moments when I've found it's classic look appropriate and others where I've question it completely. I think you put words to my negative gut feelings.

Here's some revisions based on your comments. I'm not satisfied with it the way the u and the p are disconnected but look as though they should be connected. As a purist, modifying it to allow them to connect is painful. Any suggestions on how to resolve that issue? Is it even an issue?

I'm also showing another variation of the same logo just because I think it might also work. Once again, thanks for your time and suggestions.

On a side note–do you guys when normally present the client 1 logo direction or do you provide 2 and let them choose a direction they like? Also do you present the logo(s) with color studies and applications (call card) all at once or do you show the logo then go back to do color study and applications after they've picked a direction?

Once again, thanks in advance for any and all input you have all been very helpful.</div>

With that out of the way I submit for your wonderful insight direction number 2…

One of the features of these luxury portable toilets is that they feature A/C. Here I'm playing with the a fan/floral symbol in place of the "o". Does this read clearly? Thoughts? I can't decide whether I need to be more literal (not my personal preference) with a fan or a flower. Any and all comments are welcome. Thanks once again in advance!

Seriously though ... I'd be wary about including brown in a restroom logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe it's just me, but I really don't like the script in a given context. It just seems to give the wrong (artsy-fartsy if you pardon my French) impression. Perhaps a lighter, non-oblique weight of TOWN type for UP would be more fitting.

Also, I agree with other comments suggesting to align Restrooms to the left of T and the bottom of p's descender.</div>

If you're going to show the fan one and its friends, please change the restooms to restrooms ;^)</div>

*ToAll – Brown? What was I thinking? Might as well just work a roll of toilet paper in to the logo :)

I'm attaching some versions with different placements of "RESTROOMS". What do you think? I've also touched up the curve (very subtly) of the u + p connection. Thanks once again.

		<div class="commentbody">Agree about the u-p connection. Much better now. Could they be slightly tighter?

I tried setting 'town' in Filosofia Unicase (since you mentioned it earlier). I won't post it, but maybe you could have a look. I think the lowercase 'n' looks interesting. Dare I say it might appeal to the female audience?

*rlynch–wonderful suggestion about looking at Filosofia again. The top one is the original (with restrooms above the p descender (to me it feels more comfortable there) and the bottom two are variations using Filosofia.

These are a possible second direction. Thanks guys. You have all been so helpful.
