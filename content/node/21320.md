  25.. but I'm a lil bit stuck so i'd need your opinions and criticism, please.. \r\nthe
  slogan for the site will be \"take a seat and play\"\r\n\r\nmy favourite one so
  far is concept one featuring the table(green) and four seats (blue) but i'm not
  too sure about the font.. \r\nc&c would be appreciated.. \r\n\r\ncheers mike"

  body: Don't over think this one. Stay with your original thought but find out how
    they are going to use this logo. You might not be able to use a gradient and I
    don't think gradients add to  designs, its like gilding the lilly.

    the UK since they've won their only football worldcup in 1966) \r\n\r\npersonally

    and Leicester</a> and number 7 has similarities to <a href=\"http://www.abbey.com/\">Abbey</a>
    which means to me that the name choice should inspire a complete rethink, the
    table and chairs indicates poker (or at least card games), exactly the opposite
    of skill games as you defined it. Sorry this is negative but the name change has
    torpedoed the (in my opinion) stronger concepts.\r\n\r\n>it\u2019s a popular number
    in the UK since they\u2019ve won their only football worldcup in 1966\r\nActually
    it is England\u2019s (not UK's) only World Cup, and it seems a pretty tenuous
    link to me, even being a football fan for most of my life and reminded every four
    years that it is the only World Cup we have won I wouldn't draw that connection.
    Mind you, 1066 is another significant date in British history.\r\n\r\nTim"

    with you that the connection between 66 and the name is far-fetched since it's
    not going to be a site about english footie.. but nevertheless they wanted the
    name so they'll have to live with it.. \r\n\r\nback to the topic.. I've created
    a new concept which fits pretty good imo.. you've got a strong bold font, a dynamic
    colour and the connection to table with the table top wich also emphasizes the
    skill aspect because you have to stay sharp and move on (with your skills) in
    order to win a lot of money.. what do you guys think?\r\n\r\ncheers mike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/table66_5840.jpg]"

  body: "My first impression is pool, snooker or billiards, which does fit into your
    definition of one aspect of skill games although maybe to the exclusion of others.
    I think you need to look more at the interaction of cue (green flash) and text,
    especially at the counters of the a & b and in the small size where the l becomes
    i, you might also want to look at increasing the weight of the numerals. The slogan
    could be a touch wider (larger) just to bring it to visual justification on table.\r\nTim"

    emphasizing it on pool too much would take away the chance of other games such

  body: "@mikeb7\r\n\r\nI think it would be dangerous to emphasize the pool 'too'
    much, but I also feel like not emphasizing one game in a way thats immediately
    recognizeable might leave you with a logo that doesnt emphasize anything. Granted,
    it would be best to come up with some sort of symbol that would, to everyone,
    immediately say 'all skill games', but im not sure something like that exists.
    Something subtle like having the 66 on a pool ball (maybe without the cue in there)
    would at least have people looking at it and thinking pool and things like that.
    Once they saw the site they would know that there was so much more of course,
    but with the logo you want to have something that will draw people in. I think
    pool is a pretty universal skill game, so it would work well. I think darts might
    work well in that respect too.\r\n\r\nEven if in the end you dont end up emphasizing
    it so much, looking at particular games will give you a good jumping off point."

    to form an arm/elbow? That's because I think a) looks best of all the options
    (and also because the b and l form the 'gate' you lie your queue on when playing
    pool), just that it creates the problem with the t - it seems to be standing out
    (towards the viewer) too much to still form a nice connected word. If you'd make
    the upper stroke of the t extend, it could fix that?!\r\n\r\nAlso, i think you
    should definately put in the extra 'end-stroke' for the queue like in the previous
    b) - it creates the nice image of someone really holding the queue.\r\n\r\ntake
    this with a grain of salt though, I'd still consider myself a noob ;)"

    up and two or three gnat's to the right). For the black and white I almost want
