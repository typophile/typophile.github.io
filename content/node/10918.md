    This was known as the Monotype Machine.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not aware that there
    was another name it was also known by. <BR> <BR>At first I thought this latter

    are I&#39;ve misquoted something somewhere. Is there a rule for this??

  body: Oh, you wouldn&#39;t happen to be looking for Joseph-Marie Jacquard, inventor
    of punch-card-controlled looms, as the answer would you? If so, I think the question
    was a little confusing, as it didn&#39;t make clear that you were looking for
    the <i>precursor</i> of the punch-<i>tape</i> used on Monotype keyboards.

    and &#40;c&#41; &#40;although I&#39;m not sure that &#39;Jacquard Loom&#39; counts
    as a nickname per se&#41;? <BR> <BR>Are you sure you meant Linotype D Keyboard?
    I know that Linotype developed a punched-tape keyboard arrangement, but the kind
    of typecasting mechanism you described &#40;movement of matrix case, casting of
    individual sorts&#41; is Monotype, not Linotype. The Linotype punch-tape was read
    by a machine that attached to a normal Linotype caster/keyboard arrangment, and
    essentially the punch-tape drove the keyboard to release matrices, etc. to cast
    lines-o-type.

  body: Okay. I actually <i>meant</i> to type Lanston D Keyboard not Linotype, because
    as we know it was <i>Monotype</i>. Since posting this inarticulately prosed question
    I&#39;ve since found more information, but <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/DKeyboard.html"
    target="_blank"> this</a> is from whence came the idea.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I suppose we are in a bit of a bind now, as both
    Eduardo and John both supplied part of the correct answer. Is there a rule for
    this?  <BR> <BR>Gerald, I&#39;m not so sure you should get it as you had a bit

  body: It wasn&#39;t a guess! It was an inquiry to find out if I had correctly interpreted
    the question. I was not guessing that Jacquard invented the punch-card-controlled
    loom -- I knew this --, I was wondering whether Tiffany was actually looking for
    the name of the inventor of this device. <BR> <BR>However, just to keep things
    zany, I do not have time today to come up with a new question so, under the rules,
    the question will revert back to Tiffany but, presuming she&#39;s had enough,
    it will then revert back to me as quizmaster, and I can opt to invite another
    participant to pose the next question. So, Gerald, unless Tiffany announces in
    the next five minutes that she wants to pose another question, I hereby nominate
    you to pose the next question.
