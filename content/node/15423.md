  got a much-loved font simply called DIN and it functions perfectly in Illus, but
  not Quark.  As soon as I upgraded my Q 6.1 to 6.5, documents with DIN Light open
  with errors in locating that font.\r\n\r\nI've tested the font in Illus with no
  problem.\r\n\r\nI tried reloading the font and that didn't get me anywhere either.\r\n\r\nWhat
  gives?  I'm stumped.\r\n\r\nThanks for any tips.\r\n\r\n.a"

    the same thing with one of our fonts and Quark 6.5.\r\n\r\nAre you by chance using
    Font Reserve?"

  body: DIN will not read in quark when it's activated through some font managers.
    I have had to copy it in to my OSX user/library/fonts folder and then it works
    fine.
