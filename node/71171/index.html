  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As you might now, the long awaited, 15+ years, version 1.0.0 of STIX fonts have been finally released. However, the release disappointed many people who want to typeset mathematics with STIX fonts, as they neither released LaTeX support files nor supplemented the fonts with the new OpenType MATH table, ruling out any quality mathematical typesetting engine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, STIX were kind enough to release the fonts under Open Font License, so giving the community the power to scratch their itch and not wait yet another 15 years for next release.</p>
<p>Having experimented with an OpenType MATH version of STIX beta release, it was relatively easy to supplement the final release with MATH layout features, thanks to the powerful FontForge who never let me down, and so XITS was officially born.</p>
<p>Despite being written in all caps, XITS in not an acronym but a funny way to get around the reserved name clause if OFL, which I never liked BTW, it also hints the long term goal to enhance it with right to left mathematical typesetting capabilities.</p>
<p>The font is still beta as regards the OpenType layout, any help or feedback is highly appreciated, especially testing with MS Office 2007 since I no longer have access to Windows machine and thus did all my testing on ConTeXt/LuaTeX.</p>
<p>After the poring introduction, here is the download link:
<a href="http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads">http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads</a></p>
<p>And here are some examples:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My computer came with a version installed and I can still use it, so I tried to reproduce your formulas. The extensible square roots are broken:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_sqrt_5569.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the font menu, XITS Math appears very small (it&rsquo;s also the case for Asana Math, but not for Cambria Math, so there must be a way around it).</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_menu_3662.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the formula with P(x,y), the P is very close to the parenthesis; I tested with other letters like F and the problem is the same, but doesn&rsquo;t happen with letters like G so it seems the italic correction is not taken into account, as seen on the formula F_1^2:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_P_ic_4581.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the first formula, when I tried to build it up with large delimiters everywhere, a strange result appeared:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_del_size_6252.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sizes of delimiters are better in Cambria:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/cambria_word_2007_del_size_4412.png" alt=""></p>
<p>or Asana:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/asana_word_2007_del_size_5699.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lastly, when I tried to make a PDF with PDFCreator, a PDF was produced, but it only contained, after a first page blank, the following error message:</p>
<code>
ERROR: undefinedresource
OFFENDING COMMAND: findresource
STACK:
/ADBCFF+XITSMath
/CIDFont
/ADBCFF+XITSMath
[0 -1000 250 0 ]
2745
</code>
<p>PDF production works with both Asana or Cambria, so it must be something in the XITS fonts which causes it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you. It&rsquo;s good to see people working on math fonts.</p>

<p>The 4th issue is related to this too, there is something wrong with glyph assembly but I cannot identify.</p>
<p>The 2nd issue results from the very large WinAscent/Descent values in the font, which is needed to avoid clipping large glyphs. Though the font have TypoAscent/Descent and fsSelection bit 7 set properly, they are ignored by office for reasons I don&rsquo;t know. Not sure what Cambria does, but it could be because of its embedded bitmaps that don&rsquo;t have any of the large glyphs.</p>
<p>The 3rd issue is due to lack of italic correction for the capitals, I&rsquo;m already working on it.</p>
<p>The PDF issue is strange, could you try other PDF generators? it is like a bug in PDFCreator that got triggered by XITS.</p>

<p>The fsSelection bit 7 is only defined in OS/2 table version 4, but your xits-math font uses OS/2 table version 2.</p>

<p>Good catch, thanks. However this don&rsquo;t seem to make any difference, it seems that Office ignores this bit completely.</p>
<p>Now I got access to a machine with Office 2007 again, it seems that the only way to fix this is to bundle the math in regular fonts in a truetype collection file, like Cambria, but since Windows doesn&rsquo;t accept TTC with CFF, this isn&rsquo;t feasible.</p>

<p>If it’s the same as for Word 2007, once you have changed the math font in the Design Ribbon &gt; Tools &gt; Equation Options, you must open a new formula for the change to be in effect, the old formula stays as it was.</p>
<p>@Khaled Hosny</p>
<p>The italic correction now works.</p>
<p>Concerning the second issue, did you do everything mentioned in Murray Sargent’s [[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/murrays/archive/2009/12/01/high-fonts-and-math-fonts.aspx|High Fonts and Math Fonts]] post? Because it seems that the lines are too high at the top if I select XITS Math for text (that was with the latest 1.003 version):</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-003_math_height_4804.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Concerning the PDF issue, I&rsquo;ve tried in OpenOffice to convert into PDF a blank document with only one letter in XITS Math (used as text font). It worked perfectly with OpenOffice’s integrated PDF capabilities, but gave the same error message as previously (except for the last line) when I tried PDFCreator.</p>

<p>I did, this post with actually a repose to a question I sent to him. As I said earlier, I have set typoAscent/Descent and line gap to exactly the same values used in the text font, and set the use_typo_metrics bit, but as you see, Office still using the winAscent/Descent. Here, on Linux, the math font gives me proper line spacing with all GUI apps I tested (didn&rsquo;t test OpenOffice because I&rsquo;ve old version with no support for CFF fonts), who is in fault here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is wrong with PDFCreator either, but what happens if you use the original STIX fonts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m testing the current beta (1.004) in every bit of software I can, and so far I&rsquo;ve only found a few problems.</p>
<p>First, the delimiter issue Philippe mentioned is likely caused by the lack of extendable floor/ceiling brackets—I noticed that, unlike Cambria and Asana, there&rsquo;s no entry for them in the Vertical Construction part of the MATH table, so they max out at the .size4 variant.</p>
<p>In ConTeXt/LuaTeX, using \vec with Greek letters causes the arrow to be offset to the left, possibly because none of the italic Greek math letters have Top Accent values.  This isn&rsquo;t an issue in XeLaTeX (using unicode-math) or Word 2007.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a problem with \vec and some Greek and Latin lowercase italic math letters in XeLaTeX (d,f,m,w,κ,μ,π,σ,φ (both forms),χ,ψ and ω; I haven&rsquo;t tested non-italic or uppercase letters yet) where adding an exponent or prime outside the \vec command causes the arrow to both drop closer to the letter and lengthen, colliding with the exponent.  This may actually be a unicode-math or XeTeX bug.</p>

<p>The \vec issue is now fixed too, almost. I added top accent position to Greek, except bold upright, it is a boring job :)</p>
<p>The XeLaTeX issue is known, it has been reported to Jonathan Kew while ago, but I don&rsquo;t think it is going to be fixed any time soon. In my experience, LuaTeX has much better OpenType MATH support, but unicode-math package has incomplete LuaTeX support, so my recommondation for OpenType math in TeX is to use ConTeXt MkIV until LaTeX gets better LuaTeX support.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since the last time, I’ve tested a little more the XITS font. The floor and ceil delimiter issue is better than in the previous version but does not seem to have been completely fixed:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/floor_size_xits_1-005_5524.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Does the same happen when using XITS in ConTeXt? Using LaTeX, I’ve compared to how other fonts behave, and some have the same problems, like txfonts:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/floor_size_txfonts_4167.png" alt=""></p>
<p>and some others don’t, like Computer Modern:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/floor_size_cm_6026.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I suppose it’s due to relative heights of math delimiters, which are not always the same as Computer Modern, so the problem might not be fixable without redesigning the large delimiters.</p>
<p>Another problem, which has not changed since version 1.004 is a few italic correction and sub/supscript kerning issues. The main problem is with Blackboard bold symbols, some of which lack italic correction; the A also lacks negative kerning for the exponent:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_mathbb_4617.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve marked the L with a “?” because it might not be a good idea for this character to add negative exponent kerning (I know it’s been done with Times 569 4-line Mathematics, but it was for an italic <em>L</em>).</p>
<p>Most of the mathcal letters would also benefit from having italic correction:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_mathcal_4227.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, some of the upright capital letters (in all forms: roman/italic, medium/bold, serif/sans, latin/greek/nabla) would benefit from italic correction or exponent kerning:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_upright_5729.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve installed the unicode-math package under MikTeX 2.8 to try XITS Math in XeLaTeX and noticed that many symbols don’t come up correctly:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-005_xelatex_6234.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Do you have any idea where this is coming from? (There’s no problem with Cambria Math or Asana Math.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The remaining floor and ceiling delimiters issue is a bit trickier, I may try to give it a look later, but it is a low priority now.</p>
<p>Intermingled symbols with XeTeX are likely to be caused by presence of more than on version of the font accessible to XeTeX (e.g. one system wide copy and one installed in TEXMF tree), make sure you have only one version of the font (or identical copies), having different version of same font installed is known to lead to such issue in XeTeX.</p>
<p>The script alphabet is a bit trickier, the glyphs are spaced as italics, so the width of the glyph equals the width of the bounding box, that is why subscripts are so far. Here italic correction will not help, we instead need to use math kerning support in OpenType math, but I&rsquo;m unlikely to do this for the first &ldquo;stable&rdquo; version (no much time for math fonts right now). The need for math kerning is also true for the upright alphabets. The double struck alphabet can benefit from some italic correction too, I think I can do that, but not the finer math kerning.</p>

<p>I thought about this too, but I tend not to change STIX glyph metrics unless there is a good reason, and here I&rsquo;m not sure what the implications of changing the advance width on spacing and it would need more extensive testing. Math kerning can solve the sub/superscript issue without the need to change the advance width, and we need it anyway to fine tone the positioning of many base/*script combinations, but it has to wait.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about it before, but seems that XeTeX ignores FractionRuleThickness math constant, LuaTeX (either with LaTeX+unicode-math or ConTeXt works fine).</p>

<p>The problem does not appear with Cambria or Asana.
</cite></p>
<p>This is because, unlike Cambria and Asana, the default bar glyph is short (it doesn&rsquo;t descend below base line the same degree as the curly brackets. Adding explicit <code>\left</code> and <code>\right</code> will give the proper sizes (it is good idea to always do this anyway), <code>$\left|{x\in\mathbb{Q}\mid x^2&lt;2}\right|$</code>.</p>

<p>Looks like a XeTeX issue too, fine with LuaTeX.</p>

<p>When doing inline math, you often don’t want to use <code>\left</code> and <code>\right</code> as they often produce delimiters which are too high:
<img src="/images/old-images/left_right_too_high_5133.png" alt="">
These too high delimiters are not very pretty and they may also disrupt inter-line spacing (it’s not the case here). Of course, you can always <code>\smash</code> the <code>^2</code>, but it’s a bit tedious. And you still have the problem when you use the vertical bar to denote a restriction:
<img src="/images/old-images/xits_1-005_restriction_symbol_6073.png" alt="">
I suppose something can be done at macro level (I&rsquo;ll have to look up the code of unicode-math), but if in the future you decide to change some glyphs in XITS, this one would be a good candidate.</p>
