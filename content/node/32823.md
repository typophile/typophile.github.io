  a short while ago. \r\nIt's hard to describe, apart from a sans serif type with
  swirls and tendrils coming \r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate anyone helping me
  out here, words are failing me..."

  body: 'Alvy Singer: It was great seeing Annie again and I realized what a terrific
    person she was and how much fun it was just knowing her and I thought of that
    old joke, you know, the, this, this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, ''Doc,
    uh, my brother''s crazy, he thinks he''s a chicken,'' and uh, the doctor says,
    ''well why don''t you turn him in?'' And the guy says, ''I would, but I need the
    eggs.'' Well, I guess that''s pretty much now how I feel about relationships.
    You know, they''re totally irrational and crazy and absurd and, but uh, I guess
    we keep going through it...because...most of us need the eggs.'
