  thought it might make a more interesting conversation starter here.\r\n\r\nHeading
  out to eat with my friends, I got call telling me one of my faces was in a real,
  printed magazine. On the cover, no less! I grabbed everyone who happened to be with
  me and we made a trip to the nearest craft store. I just stopped and stared at the
  issues, my wife told the employees, \"My husband did that font.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/343_357_popup_4994.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAt
  dinner, with the magazine on the table between us, I spent 15 minutes explaining
  the differences between fonts and typefaces, glyphs and letters. People were actually
  fascinated by the detail. Between dangerously hot wings, I demonstrated ligatures
  with a napkin and a sharpie. We discussed how people can recognize the same letters
  in different styles. It was too fun.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, does anyone else have
  interesting stories of the first time they found their type design(s) unplanned
  in print or illustration, or on a sign or wall, or otherwise where you hadn't arranged
  for it to be?"

    photographed scrapbook page (specimen?, work?) uses !Sketchy Times Bold. This
    was a free font that became popular with scrapbookers. A sticker company contacted
    me, and I did an updated version exclusively for them. Evidently, they picked
    well; they didn't know about the use until they saw the cover at a trade show!"

    ago. All the banners used a font I had done. I smiled. Knowing no one else would
    care, I kept it to myself. (congrats, btw!)\r\n"
