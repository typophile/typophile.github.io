  body: '&#62;&#34;Unfortunately however, sales of font software for Precision Type
    and many others companies in the font business have been adversely affected in
    recent years by a growing supply of free font software via the Internet.&#34;
    &#40;From Precision Type&#39;s announcement&#41; <BR> <BR>Is that really the case?
    <BR> <BR>Possible culprits: <BR> <BR>1. Free fonts: bundled with applications
    &#40;Adobe&#41; <BR>2. Free fonts: with operating sytems &#40;Apple, Microsoft&#41;
    <BR>3. Free fonts: Freefonts.com, etc. <BR>4. Cheap font collections: Adobe, Bitstream,
    Corel  <BR>5. Pirated fonts: online p2p <BR>6. Pirated fonts:  b2b  <BR>7. Online
    competition: mega-stores &#40;Myfonts, Fonts.com&#41; <BR>8. Online competition:
    proliferation of online foundries and distributors <BR>9. Competition in general:
    eg Veer&#39;s DM &#43; online <BR>10. Product selection. <BR> <BR>On this last
    point, it may be that Precision Type had over-associated itself with foundries
    &#40;see list on its obituary page&#41; that started out as &#34;wholesale suppliers&#34;,
    but subsequently ramped up their &#34;factory sales&#34; internet activity to
    become much stronger competitors.  <BR>'

    and forget about bundling, which has as strong an impact.

  body: I was not familiar with their library when they liquidated, did they distribute
    any new fonts made in the last 5 years? I was under the imression most of what
    they were pushing was generally &#39;old&#39; and very accessable via other distributors,
    is this correct? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    It&#39;s not as if this is new technology &#40;Adobe&#39;s been doing it for seven
    years&#41;... seems like maybe they just failed to keep up with the times. Seems
    like they could have been competing with MyFonts.... But I don&#39;t know what
    their situation was. <BR> <BR>T <BR> <BR>

    They are also illegal in many countries, in contravention of &#34;Fair Business
    Practice&#34;, but the authorities are not going after the font perp&#39;s, their
    #1 target is Microsoft -- as with the recent EU fine of Microsoft for bundling
    other software with its OS.   <BR> <BR>Here is a section from the Canadian Competition
    Act, &#34;Offences in Relation to Competitiion&#34;: <BR> <BR>50. &#40;1&#41;
    Every one engaged in a business who <BR> <BR>&#40;c&#41; engages in a policy of
    selling products at prices unreasonably low, having the effect or tendency of
    substantially lessening competition or eliminating a competitor, or designed to
    have that effect, <BR> <BR>is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
    for a term not exceeding two years. <BR> <BR>This is an &#34;anti-dumping&#34;
    law, which would apply to bundling free software, but as with many things digital,
    there appears to be a different standard as to what businesses can get away with.

    that they link to Eyewire is a pretty good indication they have not been active
    in or paying attention to the &#34;marketplace&#34; for a long time.

  body: 'Nick, <BR> <BR>There is a pretty huge difference between Microsoft&#39;s
    bundling web browsers and media players in their operating system, and other folks
    bundling fonts with their applications. Among other things, I doubt you&#39;ll
    find folks engaged in font bundling writing notes to each other about how the
    small type foundries must have their air supply cut off. <BR> <BR>I rather suspect
    that making false public allegations that somebody is breaking the law can get
    you in trouble. I don&#39;t know whether your current comments are libellous.
    I also don&#39;t know how much of a defence ignorance is against a libel lawsuit.
    I just think you should be a little more careful. <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t a threat
    or anything: even if I was personally ticked off enough to talk to our lawyers,
    I doubt Adobe would bother with this sort of nonsense. But you&#39;re making pretty
    broad blanket statements, and some folks in the type industry are much more aggressive
    in their legal activities than Adobe is. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Thomas, <BR> <BR>Thank you for the warning. <BR> <BR>I was incorrect in stating
    that font bundling is against the law in many countries, because this has not
    been proven. <BR> <BR>So let me just ask the readers of this thread to look at
    the section of the Canada Competition Act that I quoted, and draw their own conclusions.
    <BR> <BR>Rest assured, I will not be suing any large companies, my pockets aren&#39;t
    deep enough.

  body: <i>Also, did Precision Type ever offer online ordering and downloading of

    was a reseller for Precision Type &#40;Beowulf in St. Paul&#41;. At that time
    they sent us several CDs with all their fonts. We&#39;d send a P.O. for the font
    we wanted and they&#39;d send us a code to unlock the font. We could then e-mail
    the fonts to our buyers. At the time it seemed speedy! <BR> <BR>I use their book
    often when trying to track down unfamiliar typefaces. However, it&#39;s much easier
    just to post a sample here on the identification board. The speed of responses
    here is just amazing! <BR> <BR>kristin <BR>

    is not a legal definition, but &#34;tied selling&#34; is. <BR> <BR>So here is

    <BR>Beowulf was a pre-press company that was created out of staff who remained
    when the company Great Faces was dissolved. Beowulf was located in the Union Depot
    for a few years and it also went under. Some of the remaining folks were with
    a firm called GreatGraphix &#40;sp?&#41; somewhere in Bloomington. That company
    dissolved as well. <BR> <BR>
