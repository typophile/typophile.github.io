  body: ' their called &#39;web designers&#39; who were hired to make the logo or
    who threw it in while designing the site cause it looked cooler, unaware of branding
    system you can usually hear them over the phones asking: camera what?... <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s what happened here...the site is &#39;under construction&#39;
    the logo is rather large, rather vector and the tell tale url taglined on the
    bottom. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d ask the web-designer for their eps files '
