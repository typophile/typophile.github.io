  body: Is this a trick question? I would say no. Looks more like Trade Gothic Condensed,
    Alternate Gothic, etc.

  body: "Oh, man. Everything above made me laugh aloud. The terse question, the somehow
    ironic image, and the incredulous, Socratic reply. It was all in the timing and
    presentation.\r\n\r\nIt's also 1:45 a.m. and I'm getting punchy. A fine way to
    end the day.\r\n\r\nThanks for the laugh."

    it was no joke or bluff.\r\n\r\nthe <strong> W </strong> looks like it has been
    \"narrowed\" to fit..  or what do you say?\r\nit was the <strong> ! </strong>
    that made me think it was Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe album was released in June
    1981 so I reckon the design was not made with computer."
