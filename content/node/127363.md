body: Hi.  These are from sheet music published in the 1960s; sorry for low quality.  I
  thought the G and R (plus C, M, W) would be enough to locate it in Rookledge, but
  no luck.  Didn't spot it in Jaspert either.

  body: "So after a bit more investigation, this seems to be related to Beaudoire's
    19th-c. Elzevir (based on caps from Perrin's Caract\xE8res Augustaux), but I'm
    not sure exactly what version...  Still haven't found a sample from 1960s or earlier
    that matches all the letters above."
