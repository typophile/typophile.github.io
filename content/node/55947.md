body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI\u2019m working on a project where I spaced (with kerning)
  the caps wider (In classes based on shape) when they stand next to each other. Now
  my space (Glyph) is too small for in between capitals.\r\n\r\n> Now my question
  is, what is the quickest/Best way to make the space bigger?\r\n\r\n1 Kern, this
  means I have to put in a lot of data! Or expand my classes and make a new class?\r\n2
  Replace with space.alt (Never done this, so have no idea how the code will look
  like)\r\n3 Spacing the capitals with the kern feature is not smart\r\n\r\nMaybe
  this is already somewhere explained on the forum, I used the search, but I may don\u2019t
  know the right jargon.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBruno "

  body: "Such spacing should be done by the user of type, not the designer. There
    are too many situations where it is just wrong. The OpenType spec has a feature
    that can be used for spacing all cap settings, and InDesign, at least, will use
    it. It is off by default, but the comp can switch it on. Getting the values right
    for many standard situations, so all the comp has to do is to switch it on, would
    be a plus. You might want to include punctuation, but do give it a different (smaller)
    value. Depending on the fit of the lining numbers, you might want to give them
    a smaller value too.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have replaced space by space.case in some OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nI put
    it in the \"case\" feature, so that it works when \"all caps' is selected.\r\n\r\n\"sub
    space by space.alt\"--where that space.alt is a bit wider than the space character.\r\nI
    use space.alt rather than, say, the Unicode one-third em space, so that the text
    is not altered by the feature.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is to make the look of all
    caps similar to that of all small caps, which uses the space.\r\nAlso, as a proportion
    of the cap height, the space is a lot narrower than the proportion it is of x-height,
    so in some fonts it just looks very, very narrow.\r\n\r\nI rarely use the \"cpsp\"
    feature. "

    space?

  body: "@ Everyone\r\nThank you for reply!\r\n\r\n@ James Puckett\r\nWhat will be
    a smart way of doing it?\r\n\r\n@Charles_e \r\nThe metrics of the capitals are
    quite narrow so my kerning would be minimal with lowercase is minimal. The I kerned
    Caps with Caps positive. The intention was the lowercase as the base for the metrics
    of all other glyphs. but it didn\u2019t really work out like that. In the end
    its less work to kern the odd cap.\r\n\r\nSorry for my late reaction, I didn\u2019t
    find the a notify by email button yet.\r\n\r\n@ nick\r\nWhere can I find info
    about how the features should be called to work in those functions, is there some
    kind of ISO list?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nBruno\r\n\r\n"
