  body: "Good question\u2014for the type-crazed :) \r\n\r\nI would definitely not
    do old style figures with superscript ordinals. I don't think superscript ordinals
    were ever used with old style, and they stick out above them in an awkward way,
    to my eyes. \r\n\r\nYou can use superscript with lining figures, providing you
    have designed superscript letters for the ordinals. Minion does have a designed
    superscript s and t, but here they look like fake superscript, made by the program,
    and are too small and light. \r\n\r\nAlso I am surprised by the small size of
    the Minion old style figures. I never noticed it before, but the 21 looks too
    small compared to the \"the\" and the \"st,\" which is giving \"21st\" problems
    when you have old style figures and regular lower case.  I don't understand this
    as Slimbach's Adobe Garamond and Adobe Jenson both have the short old style figures
    a bit taller than the overshoot height of o,e, etc. And I thought that was \"normal\".
    I think you are having problems partly because of what seems to me a mistake in
    Minion. (The other mistake in this otherwise fabulous font is excessive kerning
    of the quotes, IMHO.)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Word's doing fake superscript ordinals
    with everything I think has put some people off them altogether. Mitchell & Wightman's
    Book Typography banishes superscript ordinals altogether (in English). I agree,
    since they seem to me pretty pointless. \r\n\r\nHowever, I admit that in some
    fonts with superscript ordinals they can look OK with lining figures, provided
    the program actually gives you the designed superscript ordinals.  \r\n"
