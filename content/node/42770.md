  and typefaces are not something I can be spending money on because I am pretty much
  broke. But I might be able to get some better suggestions if I tell you that it
  is realistic si-fi and much of it has to do with robots. Some of the fonts I have
  been looking at are Perpetua and Trump Mediaeval and they are both very good, so
  something similar would be great.\r\n\r\n              -Thanks,\r\n                  Yamfox

    but if Perpetua looks good to you, you must be using it around a 14-point setting.
    And if it reminds you of robots & science fiction, I guess we inhabit different
    planets.\r\n\r\nPostScript Perpetua never did work very well, and even in metal
    it only worked at larger sizes. Don't look at the type as it comes off your laser
    printer; that will in no way look the same as when printed on an offset press."

  body: The reason I like Perpetua is because my younger brother reads the 'Artemis
    Fowl' series of books and the font caught my eye. After some searching I learned
    that it used 13.5 pt. Perpetua. And it looks quite good in the book, actually.

  body: "And the tone of the book is very unique. It is hard to describe it, but I
    guess I can give a quick plot description.\r\n\r\nPLOT: Twelve year old Cahal
    Anakoni Marcon suffers the loss of his father due to leukemia in 1958. He makes
    a vow to carry on his father's work at the University of Pennsylvania, where his
    father helped develop the ENIAC supercomputer. After graduating from college he
    works as professor there for many years, until he finds out about the invention
    of the microprocessor in 1971. After getting his hands on the chip, he experiments
    with it to try to create a small, powerful computer, which ends up becoming a
    fully-fledged robot. He keeps updating the robot and it eventually is able to
    talk with a 2,000 word vocabulary and even mop his kitchen. He gives the robot
    the name Erica, and brings it to a local science fair, where he wins first prize.
    The prize of $3,000 dollars helps him create some new  components and it eventually
    is able to do most things an average 6-year old can do. In 1985, after years developing
    the robot, he brings it to Armonk, New York and shows it to IBM. They turn out
    to be interested in his robot, and ask him if they can reverse engineer the robot
    to help develop some of their products. After learning that he will not get paid,
    he turns the offer down. He soon develops a program to help the robot learn, and
    soon it knows enough that they are having genuine conversations and the robot
    becomes a companion to Cahal. After suffering a bike accident, he does not see
    the robot for a few weeks. When he comes home, it turns out the robot was sitting
    at the counter with a cake frosted with the letters 'Get Well Soon'. \"I just
    made it for you.\" the robot replied. After this happened, he learned that the
    robot is smart enough to help people, and soon arranges with the nearest nursing
    home to introduce the robot with the residents and possibly have him work there
    for a few weeks. After it helps many of the residents and even cooked dinner for
    them, the nursing home allowed him to stay for 2 weeks, after which they would
    pay\r\nCahal for every hour the robot worked. As it turned out, he worked nonstop
    for the whole 2 weeks. They ended up paying him $1,428. In 1992, Cahal is proven
    HIV-positive and leukemia diagnosed. The robot takes care of him until 1999, when
    Cahal dies. The robot calls the funeral home, all of Cahal's surviving family
    members and the university. After the funeral, the university asks the robot if
    they can research him. After agreeing this is what Cahal would have wanted, he
    allows them to research him. In 2014, the university announces that they have
    created the most intelligent robot in the world, from both their own software
    and software reversed engineered of the robot.\r\n\r\nPretty crazy, I know.   \r\n
