  body: "WOW I emailed regarding this prior and he actually replied! Cool...\r\n\r\nAnyway
    this is what he said...\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Hubert,\r\n\r\nThank you for your kind
    note.\r\n\r\nThis image is a random image taken from a collaborative project with
    artists from both Switzerland and Egypt, realised in Cairo in 2005.\r\nIt is a
    visual essay about the reality of the egyptian capital, a megacity of the third
    world, which resulted in a small but substantial photographic book with more than
    400 pages, called \"Do you cake?\". The cryptic title refers to the equally cryptic
    question of a hotel maid asked at breakfast one morning in a Cairo hotel, when
    she was about to serve the usual tea and cake.\r\n\r\nIt is a little-known project
    that I am quite fond of. I attach a jpg of the front cover.\r\nThe book is available
    on request through Pro Helvetia in Cairo, in case you would like to obtain a copy:\r\n\r\nPro
    Helvetia Cairo\r\nSwiss Arts Council\r\nHebba Sherif\r\nDirector\r\nc/o Embassy
    of Switzerland\r\n10, Abdel Khaleq Tharwat Street,\r\nEG-Cairo, Egypt\r\nTel.

    this answers your question!\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nCornel Windlin\r\n\r\nIt not
    him...lol..."
