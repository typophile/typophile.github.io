  body: What a bunch of experts we have here. Thank you, Raph, for mentioning Caledonia.
    Sheesh! In this time period, every other book was printed in Caledonia, and what
    wasn&#39;t, was printed in Granjon. These types are almost unknown to today&#39;s
    cognescenti because they did not have happy transitions either to photo or digital,
    but they were utter mainstays of the day. So was Electra. And Vinnie, congratulations
    for reading Types Best Remembered/Best Forgotten, but, as someone who has actually
    made a Franklin Gothic from the ATF originals, and as someone who has some experience
    typesetting with ITC Franklin Gothic, I have to say that ITC FG is one of the
    best implemented digital types there is. For overall quality and fitting, very
    few sans serifs come close. The design isn&#39;t really the important thing here.
    It&#39;s how well it works. This is one of the most functional types in the entire
    digital universe.

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason; there&#39;s a twist here that
    one must note: text fonts have less presence in &#34;conscious memory&#34; than
    display fonts&#42;. Type that&#39;s easy to read &#40;conventional, set small,
    etc.&#41; is by nature harder to appreciate stylistically; laymen -the main point
    of our concern, hopefully- can&#39;t really tell the difference between Caledonia
    and Granjon and Times&#42;&#42;, unless you hold their noses to the page and force
    them to notice differences. In this way, display fonts are in effect more representative
    of time periods &#40;at least in the conscious realm&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; This
    is also probably why they last longer than display fonts. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    Also, one would think that newspaper fonts would be even more significant here
    than book faces - but I think both are secondary. <BR> <BR>As for Lightline Gothic,
    it was designed by MFB too, right?&#42; If so, it seems misguided to lay any kind
    of blame on Franklin Gothic. Plus I can&#39;t find any reference to this stuff
    in the &#34;Types Best Remembered&#34; contents list... What page is it on? <BR>

  body: '&#62;So that is why I don&#39;t like it because Franklin Gothic was a fat
    boy not a whole family. <BR> <BR>Oh, well that makes more sense. But two things:
    has anyone ever really analyzed all these fonts and discerned what the relationships
    might be? I just give as one example, News Gothic. I did a two weight multiple
    master for Bitstream of this, rather limited. I think it was regular to bold,
    and normal to narrow? Don&#39;t exactly remember. Anyway, what I noticed at once
    was that the type was not really a good candidate for interpolation as is easily
    illustrated as soon as I tried to extrapolate to lighter and heavier or wider
    or more condensed versions. They all looked horrible, without exception. Extrapolation
    revealed the extent to which the extreme masters I used were not really compatible
    designs. But I did not do any historical research. I just used Bitstream&#39;s
    masters - the whole thing had to be done in a couple of weeks. I don&#39;t remember
    if we did an italic. Was the News Gothic bold I used really a bold designed as
    a companion for NG? Or was it in reality the base weight of Franklin Gothic? <BR>
    <BR>Now we come to Franklin Gothic. To what extent is that a unified, rationalized
    design? To what degree is it interpolable?  <BR> <BR>And that brings me to my
    second point about ITC FG, which is that the condensed and compressed weights
    are incredibly reliable and useful for tabular material where space is really
    at a premium. Is there anything to beat these rather late additions to the family
    for pure functionality? <BR> <BR>As so often with ITC fonts, it&#39;s the name,
    rather than the design, that seems to get peoples&#39; dander up. Perhaps if ITC
    FG had been called something else, people would have nothing but praise for it.
    Rather like ITC Garamond. If only it hadn&#39;t been called Garamond, it might
    have won endless praise as a superbly designed high x-height oldstyle. It, by
    the way, _has_ proven to be rationally enough configured that a successful &#40;and
    strikingly functional&#41; multiple master was made, apparently without too much
    compromise of the original design elements, and without too very much technical
    difficulty. &#40;I think it was the first MM to use an intermediate master, which
    I think, again, was only used for one letter.&#41; You could do some very nice
    pseudo-optical scaling with ITC Garamond -- in fact, by manipulating weight and
    width, you could probably come up with some variants that would be more successful
    than the rather bogus optical axes Adobe experimented with. <BR> <BR>Re Martin
    Majoor: I read that paper with interest, but isn&#39;t it striking how much life
    there is in the old, irrational sans serifs - those based on AG, and those based
    on NG/FG/LL? They are still going strong a hundred years later, yet after only
    ten years, nobody ever, ever, ever wants to see Scala again even though it was
    a breath of the freshest air in the early 90s. Also: Scala may have been the first
    intentionally designed serif/sans family but Today Sans was the first after metal
    with different optical sizes. Absolutely the first sans superfamily. &#40;Optical
    sizes, ligatures, small caps, OS figs, the lot.&#41; Mac McGrew clearly illustrated
    how useful optical scaling could be in even rather crude sans serifs. Finally,
    isn&#39;t it rather bogus to keep on prattling on about how great it is to have
    unified sans/serifs in text composition? FG and Scotch have little to do with
    one another, yet they hold up so well. &#40;Or am I wrong? Majoor makes an interesting
    case that AG is based on Walbaum, which is a cousin of Scotch; on the other hand,
    how close is the relation of the American Gothics to AG, obvious letters such
    as a and g aside?&#41;'

  body: 'Finally, nobody mentioned Linotype Janson, very widely used by many publishers
    in those years. If you want to know what was commonly used in type in the US in
    those years, the answer is, the best Lino faces because it was cheaper to do Lino
    than Mono. So the stars were the most functional of the Lino faces which are,
    presumably, Caledonia, Granjon, Janson, Garamond 3 or whatever it was called,
    Electra - have I forgotten anything obvious? What is striking, again, is that
    these faces, the lingua franca of an important era, made unconvincing transitions
    to digital and aren&#39;t any longer widely used. The single typeface of the lot
    that was successfully revived was Caledonia, and that not in the Lino version,
    but in Time Caledonia, which Matthew Carter made for Time Magazine, where it is
    still used. I guess Fairfield came a little too late to be included in this list?
    <BR> <BR>One more thing: Granjon included logotypes to eliminate the clumsy f,
    but these were very rarely used. Were such logotypes available for other of these
    popular Lino faces?  <BR> <BR>Finally, Granjon was the original interpolated typeface:
    optically interpolated by Jones &#40;?&#41; using Garamond on one side and Caslon
    on the other. It is not an authentic Garamond as Beatrice Warde claimed and a
    hundred thousand parrots have since chirped. This is clearly documented &#40;and
    is obvious to anyone who actually looks at the type&#41; in one of MacMurtrie&#39;s
    &#40;?&#41; books. It would seem that it remains the one truly successful interpolation
    of two typefaces to this day, even though with Font Chameleon, we could accomplish
    semi-convincing interpolations at the press of a button. Hey, does anyone have
    Chameleon 2? I seem to have lost my copy.'

    Trying to force that is one of the mistakes made by the ITC version, in my opinion
    &#40;it comes out as a relatively narrow &#39;c&#39;, and wide &#39;a&#39; and
    &#39;s&#39;, while Benton&#39;s version is beautifully harmonious&#41;. Franklin
    and News both come in condensed and extra condensed forms, every bit as useful
