body: Why oh why does my text-box always revert to another style when I try to type
  more text in --> even though I have assigned all the current text in the box the
  style I want? I select all, I force the style, I check to see that there are no
  character styles, nothing makes any difference.

  body: OK, so for some reason it was jumping to [next style] which I just changed
    to [same style]. Problem fixed, though I've never had to do this before. Thanks
    it was good just sharing it with the world.

  body: InDesign tries to do your thinking for you. That's really great sometimes,
    not so great other times. Quark isn't so "smart" but it's easier to manage.

  body: Me and Quark aren't on speaking terms after it deleted a day from my life.
    If we accidentally make eye contact on the street there might be a terse nod of
    the head but it doesn't go further than that. We were never great friends anyway,
    it kept wanting to change me.

  body: I still need to use both but I feel sometimes like I am juggling two lovers,
    who speak different languages. I have to remember which term of endearment to
    use in order to get what I want from them.

  body: "InD is very compulsive (even more so than PageMaker) about wanting to revert
    text boxes to the default: the solution is to make the default your \"usual\"
    text box, or to fire up various standard templates as what you really want to
    do.\r\n\r\nThe solution(s) (is)are:\r\n\r\n1. Set your default text boxes when
    you open up the applications but no documents are opened (this is detailed in
    the Help files),\r\n2. Create a range of templates for various clients,\r\n3.
    Make your default dead simple, and tinker for each document.\r\n\r\nI use a combination
    of 1 and 2 but YMMV...."

    of MS products like... PowerPoint. 'Nuff said. Bad strategy for a software company,
    whether it is MS or Adobe."

  body: On the whole I find indesign to be fine, sure it shuts down regularly but
    I ask a lot of it. I got into design using photoshop mainly so moving to indesign
    for page layout was easy, the layout seemed very intuitive whereas Quark seemed
    remote, aloof and unfriendly. I can't say I've noticed it trying to think for
    me, although Microsfoft word is another story... "sorry did you want to make that
    a bulleted list with really generous tabs? Done" "Oh right, so that looks like
    a weblink so you must want it underlined in blue, no don't thank me"...

  body: "It may sound a bit compulsive, but it's actually a pretty cool feature. You
    can set a default for a whole document and/or individual text boxes. You have
    to figure that when you open a new text box the style will have to default to
    <cite>something</cite>... if you're used to using other Adobe products then you
    probably expect that <cite>something</cite> to be the most recently used style.
    In Indesign's case it will be whatever style settings were selected prior to the
    document being open. Here's the explanation from Indesign help:\r\n\r\n<cite>If
    you change settings when no documents are open, your changes set the defaults
    for new documents. If a document is open when you change settings, the changes
    affect only that document.\r\nSimilarly, if you change settings when no objects
    are selected, your changes set the defaults for new objects.</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd
    defaults are fully scriptable, so everyone working on a project can be using the
    same defaults and, trust me, that's a beautiful thing :)"
