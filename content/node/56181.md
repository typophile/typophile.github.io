body: "Hi there! I'm a design student, re creating two magazine spreads for a type
  assignment. The two magazines are Flux and Frankie.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone
  could tell me what the body copy typefaces of each spreads were and the title typefaces?
  Otherwise a close enough one would be great! \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: The title of Flux is set in Bodoni. The ones from Frankie in Helvetica, you
    should recognize this!

  body: "Haha actually I hadn't even looked at the Frankie one properly yet. I just
    sent it it while I was trying to figure out the Flux Magazine one. What about
    the body copy though - that's not Helvetica!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help though.\r\n\r\nScala
    Sans?\r\nI thought it might be Gill Sans.. I'll look into it."

  body: "For Flux, I think the opening paragraph is Scala, then Gill Sans is probably
    right.\r\n\r\nAs for Frankie, body copy could be a Courier?"
