  body copy in a \"modern, classy sans-serif font.\" Yeah, I know, modern and classy...\r\nI've
  set it in Gotham for the moment, but I was wondering if anyone has an idea for a
  typeface that will work better or any tips for making Gotham and sans-serif in general
  more readable as body copy.\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Thanks, I'll try them all out. I like verlag, too, I just think it can get
    uncomfortable if reading a huge chunk of it (I've also, personally, used it too
    much, I think.)
