  ID Pop Quiz, possibly -- but not necessarily -- providing a hint.</li>\r\n<li>Try
  to identify the typeface. To win, you need to <strong>e-mail me both the correct

  participate.</strong></i>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning
  additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published,
  and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>Every week
  a new challenge will be posted.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act
  as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is too easy,

  body: "OK Here's a hint:\r\n\r\nThis popular typeface, inspired by ancient maps,
    was released in early 2005 by an independent Swedish foundry and is also available
    through both Veer and FontShop.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the italics are the
    four swash variations. Their names come from the Latin terms for the points of
    a compass, and indicate the general orientation of the swashes on the capitals."

    a great little story, courtesy of Stuart Marks:\r\n\r\n<em>\"Here be dragons!
    This is Incognito Italic from Fountain Type. The U is from Incognito Occidens,
    the d is an alternate swash version, and the T is from Incognito Oriens. This
    was a tough one; I wouldn't have gotten it without your massive hints.</em> [Actually
    nobody did; maybe this one was bit too difficult]\r\n\r\n<em>By the way, lore
    has it that \"Here Be Dragons\" (Latin, HC SVNT DRACONES) is printed at the edges
    of old maps. According to <a href=\"http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html\">this
    site</a> there is only one documented instance of this, on the Lenox Globe in
    the New York Public Library. For some reason, a lot of people (including me) think
    that \"Here be dragons\" is printed on lots of old maps, but apparently it's just
    this one.\"</em>"

    mirrors my own sentiments:\r\n\r\n<em>\"Oh yay! Eurostile! Extended #2, to be
    exact. The first typeface I ever learned the name of! (Other than those standard
    default fonts that EVERYONE (even my Mum) knows). I came across Eurostile as a
    first year design student, and I loved its big shapes, its rounded corners, and
    its stylish feel. As have many, many, many... many others, as I soon discovered,
    and gradually it came to feel too common and plain. Which is a shame, but which
    I guess is a phenomonen common to many wonderful type designs. We all love it,
    we all use it, we all get annoyed that we all use it, so we all dump it. \r\nOh,
    and designed by Aldo Novarese (ITC Fenice, ITC Novarese), in 1962, as a more complete
    version of his earlier Microgramma (1952).\"</em>\r\n\r\nI purchased a license
    for <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=15&subpage=viewfonts\">House
    Gothic 23</a> to replace it, and I lamented the limited number of weights, because
    it is one - kickin' - face, especially the text version. <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_monoline/monoline.html\">Foundry
    Monoline</a> on the other hand is a rather spineless design."

  body: "In her <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=97\">'Design Info'
    for Filosofia</a> on the Emigre website, Licko includes this great quote from
    Bodoni from the preface of his \"Manuale Tipografico\": \r\n\r\n<cite>\"It is
    proper here to offer the four different heads under which it seems to me are derived
    the beauties of type, and the first to these is regularity - conformity without
    ambiguity, variety without dissonance, and equality and symmetry without confusion.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    reminded me of a quote by Hermann Zapf where he describes looking over the first
    print sample for a new typeface: \r\n\r\n<cite>[the letterforms] seem either pure,
    graceful, true of image, quite as [I] conceived them; or knavishly grinning, awry,
    as if out of insolence ready to fall on their faces, or too gaily hop-dancing
    on the line, wilful, unregarding of their neighbours; still others are unduly
    fat or plump or again too spidery, too meagre and wretched in expression. Others
    on the contrary have bumps on their curves, lame arches, lack tension or expression
    on the line.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs someone still in the shallows of my love for type,
    I find these two quotes most helpful for understanding the way (a way?) by which
    you can appraise and appreciate the value of a typeface."
