body: I am a graphic design student working on a brief involving the argument that
  too many typefaces exist today. What does everyone think about the bombardment of
  modern typefaces that are taking over our font libraries? Are there too many, or
  can there never be too many? All opinions appreciated.

    good thing),\r\nbut the proportion of lousy and/or boring ones is indeed annoying
    and destructive.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Monica, I agree with Hrant.  It is not that there are too many good new ones,
    it is that there are many bad ones spoiling the soup.
