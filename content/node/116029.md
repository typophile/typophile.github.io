  eventual question - but have always been an admirer of fonts and their uses in everyday
  mediums. I'm currently studying graphic design, and on my holidays have taken up
  some time to do some extra research on type classification because, well I just
  like it! Anyway, I'm reading about Humanistic/Venetian typefaces, and how that led
  the way to Old Style typefaces which were less calligraphy based and more refined
  etc. However, in half of the articles I read online, they refer to the Humanist
  typeface phase as being labelled 'Old Style'.... so I'm naturally confused a little
  right from the get-go. Is this just a result of the proximity and chronological
  order of these two styles blending into one another in some people's eyes, or is
  there an obvious distinction or answer to this that I'm completely oblivious to?\r\n\r\nAny
  kind of clarification will be very much appreciated. I really want to grasp this
  stuff as it interests me greatly."

    earliest Old Style typefaces were based on a manuscript hand to which the term
    \"Humanist\" was applied. But that term is not applied to <em>those</em> typefaces.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    when a typeface is called \"Humanist\", it's something like Gill Sans or Optima
    - a sans-serif typeface which, instead of being a classic Grotesque, a more attractive
    Gothic (a deprecated term as it's also applied to blackletters) like Franklin
    Gothic or News Gothic, or a Geometric like Futura or Kabel, borrows many of the
    proportions and characteristics of serif typefaces for more comfortable reading.\r\n\r\nNote
    that I didn't mention Helvetica and Univers, which belong to yet another category
    of sans-serif faces the name of which I don't recall offhand at the moment."

  body: "Pardon my French.\r\n\r\nThe way I understand VOX, Humanist is a subset of
    Old-Style \u2013 more specific, the first generation of antiqua types. We also
    use the term <em>Humanist</em> to describe similar skeletal structures, as well
    as traces of handwriting,  in sans serif designs. \r\n\r\nA better term, perhaps,
    is <em>Dynamic</em> (as opposed to <em>Static</em> \u2013 Grotesques, Transitionals,
    Moderns \u2013 or <em>Geometric).</em> The reason is, these terms can be applied
    to sans serifs, serifs, slab serifs, blackletters, scripts &c without historical
    conflict. This is especially relevant when a lot of contemporary type design combines
    elements from multiple \u2013 or even breaks out of \u2013 established genres.\r\n\r\nPS:
    It has been pointed out previously that there are often skeletal similarities
    in geometric and humanist designs."

  body: "Oh this is great. I've since done a lot more reading and have put your answers
    in even more context. I was thinking that the term Humanist referred more to a
    specific era, or style of typeface design that wasn't actually describing a structural
    form of the characters. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I believe Helvitca under the Vox-ATypI
    system is a neo-grotesque? Here I am pretending to know what I'm talking about
    haha...but I did discover that recently while perusing some typography blogs."
