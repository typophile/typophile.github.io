  be very wrong either <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Anyway - the reason for posting is that after,
  actually while watching, Kill Bill I was bit shocked because of the ugly typographic
  &#34;whole&#34; in such a good movie. <BR> <BR>Discussing this topic with few guys
  forced me to ask professionals. So, <b>what do you think about it?</b> <BR> <BR>/
  I found few thoughts from comments on <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2003/1022_the_kill_bil.php">Subtraction&#39;s
  website</a> and <a href="http://pixel.ee/jyri/killbilltypo.gif">here</a> you can
  refresh your memory. /
