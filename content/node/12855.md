  body: The serifs are more pronounced on all the Baskervilles I've looked at. Any
    other thoughts?

  body: a scan from a business card. I looked at the website and it is nothing like
    the Chicago Title logo type. Maybe it was typeset by some quick printer using
    some "free" font or knock-off. I did not recognize it and thought maybe someone
    else has seen it before.

  body: The engraving process might also have softened the serifs.

  body: Despite not having the spurs on the T, I think it looks like some flavor of
    Garamond.
