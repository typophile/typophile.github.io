body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm designing for a new project, for the job I am using Korolev
  Compressed Caps (display) and I really wanted to pair this with Mrs Eaves (both
  display and text) \u2013 as has been discussed on here before Mrs Eaves, is quite
  badly spaced and has quite a small x-height so is really not ideal for body copy.
  I cannot really use 3 typefaces (including 2 serifs) so I'm looking for something
  to replace Mrs Eaves that will work both for display and body. \r\n\r\nI really
  like the lyrical quality of Mrs Eaves (particularly at display sizes), Baskerville
  is possible but looks a bit 'Didone' to me. Hoefler Text is another possibility,
  just wondered if anyone had any other suggestions\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nRichard"

  body: "Try setting a page in 8 to 12 point script and you will see that most scripts
    are painful to try and read at that scale. Usually the x-height is low so you
    will have a hard time deciphering the letters. Mrs. Eaves may be lyrical, but
    its too complex for small sizes and extended reading. Scripts with large x heights
    are often clunky and boring. For body text you should use a simplified script
    that still has some grace. You could look for a Goldilocks script that is neither
    too formal -- Edwardian Script etc. -- or too casual -- aunt Emma's chicken scratches.
    Some of older scripts such as Middleton's Coronet are worth considering.  But
    this is just a personal opinion. \r\nDon"

  body: "Probably short in the lyrical quality department, but perhaps a script like
    DonScript [not published] meets the legibility test and is in the Goldilocks zone.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DonScript14Test_3568.jpg]
    \r\nDonScript is an attempt to recreate the writing of a person who strives for
    good handwriting without aspiring to be a calligrapher. It's based on my distant
    memories of doing such writing, adjusted to reflect the Palmer system of business
    penmanship. Perhaps readability of extended texts in scripts is improved by avoiding
    absolute  regularity of letter heights and having some variation in the slope
    of ascenders and descenders. I trust that you could find commercially available
    scripts that would be similarly effective or superior for extended readability.\r\nDon\r\n"
