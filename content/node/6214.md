  body: I don&#39;t know about the Bicycle font -- I couldn&#39;t find anything really
    close enough to even suggest as an alternate. As for &#34;playing cards,&#34;
    it actually looks like someone squeezed Gill Sans Light, rather than using an
    actual condensed face, but I could be wrong. Either way, mixing that and Futura
    Condensed together in an already bad design makes this piece just so difficult
    to look at. The original designer of this classic package must be turning over
    in his/her grave.
