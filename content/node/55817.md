body: "Is the consensus around here, when going through test edits with a newly exported
  font that the only way to ensure against corruption, and problems is to use some
  type of cache clearing program (such as FontNuke).\r\n\r\nI've run into some strange
  glitches such as missing glyphs showing up in my Illustrator glyph palette today\u2026
  but I've also resisted clearing my cache every time and have just been deleting
  from FontExplorer X and re-importing\u2026\r\n\r\nIs there a faster way than having
  to clear caches with either FontNuke, FE X, and restarting?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    crash while I\u2019m working, I don\u2019t need to clear the caches at all. If
    you do find yourself needing to clear system caches and reboot, don\u2019t load
    the test fonts in Fex, just output them directly to ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts
    and restart the Adobe app to get the new fonts. If you have problems just delete
    the fonts, clear the application caches, and you won\u2019t have to reboot. \r\n\r\nObviously
    this strategy works better on a desktop with a fast drive than on a laptop where
    program loading is slower."

  body: I've had no trouble with just outputting the new font version with another
    name. It doesn't matter what you call it while you're doing development testing,
    so I just append a revision number to the name, written out in English, and I
    haven't had any font conflicts that way. It also allows me to keep the earlier
    versions installed so I can easily make comparisons.

    same thing and saves a lot of time and hassle\u2026"

  body: If you output / generate to Applications:Adobe InDesign CSX:Fonts and overwrite
    the old versions, then the new fonts are loaded by InDesign instantly. No need
    to even close and re-open the current document(s). I newer had a problem with
    that procedure.

  body: "Yeah I'm coming to find that the overwrite process works well and Adobe seems
    to load the overwrite as you said, instantly\u2026 although I have the fonts activated
    through FontExplorer\u2026 It's nice to see the change happen immediately within
    the application without having to clear caches and restart\u2026"
