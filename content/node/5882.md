  <BR> <BR>Alas the font was not one of the  Sven St&uuml;ber &#39;Superlooper&#39;
  pixel fonts &#40;every other &#39;super&#39; but no Supermonomarket&#41;, and as
  Yves mentioned &#39;Stansharp&#39;  is a no go on google? <BR> <BR>I have tried
  contacting Group 94 &#40;<a href="http://www.group94.com/" target="_blank">http://www.group94.com/</a>&#41;
  but have heard nothing back &#40;can you blame them really&#41;, so my guess is
  it is a custom design by them. <BR> <BR>So after all that I have come to the conclusion
  Verdana is not such a bad screen font after all! <BR> <BR>Cheers.
