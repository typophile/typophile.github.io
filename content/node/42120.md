  New Roman, because all previous books in the series were set in times. Is there
  any alternative to Times that looks a lot a like but has more subtle feel? I know
  they won't allow me to change the typeface drastically, but maybe they won't notice
  a slight difference :) It's worth the try.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    is another pretty close re-interpretation of Times. '

    be able to use it in this project, but <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.2a/2.2.7.1.btim.htm\">BriemTimes</a>
    is yet another reinterpretation of Times Roman, for completeness\u2019 sake."

  body: "If you take a sample of Times and put some of its key letter attributes into
    the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif Font ID
    Guide]], you will see some fonts with similar structural attributes. Some certainly
    won't look much like it at all, but at least some will, and you may get some ideas.
    You can also drop out or modify one or two attributes and see what you get. You
    can be the judge of how close you would like to get to Times.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Times New Roman PS? If I recall, it's slightly wider with differences spread throughout.\r\n\r\nWhen
    MS commissioned the typeface for their OS, they had Monotype alter it to match
    the metrics of the Linotype Times that had been included in Postscript. "
