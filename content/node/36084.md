body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of design
  degree and for my final year project I am creating promotional material for a national
  poetry day.\r\n\r\nI am trying to reflect the idea that a poem / poetry can be understood
  / interpreted differently from person to person. The way I plan to show this idea
  is by taking the main text / content from the poster like the name of the day for
  example and showing numerous interpretations of the text, like counter spaces, outlines
  etc...\r\n\r\nThe only problem I have is what system and methods to use to get different
  interpretations? It needs to be somewhat accidental / unplanned. I have been looking
  at surrealist automatism, but I am not sure if this would work.\r\n\r\nI hope this
  makes sense...Any help / suggestions would be hugely appreciated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  link is something similar to what I am trying to achieve\r\n\r\nhttp://www.esono.com/boris/projects/poetry02/"
