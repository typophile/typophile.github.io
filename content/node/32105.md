  body: "Hey Yves, \r\n\r\nGot a question for ya. I know you're changing the titles
    to reflect the font answers to all the font IDs done on typophile. Are you by
    chance keeping a running tally of which fonts are identified over and over again?
    Like has Victorian been id-ed more than once? It would be interesting metrics
    to show which font gets mis-id-ed often.\r\n\r\nJust curious."

  body: "There should be something in the works to have the system do that automatically,
    but I wouldn't know if and when it might get implemented.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I am
    not by chance keeping a running tally manually. I've got more than enough on my
    plate, thank you (I have a wife and three kids, edit the Unzipped blog, write
    reviews for Typographer.org, do some occasional writing, play in a rock band,
    have a full-time graphic design job, blah blah blah...) :^D :^P "
