<p>hi. i&rsquo;m working on a visuals for a student film festival and i wanted to use some of those friendly geometric rounded sans serif fonts. i was looking for something bit quirky but logic and as simple as possible and i din&rsquo;t want it to be oddly bumpy, because lots of the fonts form this category are. i also didn&rsquo;t want the geometric construction to be the most prominent feature of the font.
i was looking for something like that, but i didn&rsquo;t find anything that would match my criteria&hellip; so in the end, i decided not to do compromises and draw something myself.
this is the result and i think it works very nice. i&rsquo;m using it for titles and headlines in the visual, not for text. the image above is from a cd cover proposal i did with the font. please, let me know what you think about it, so i can take it further and maybe design the whole family? or if you think there&rsquo;s no more room for this kind of typeface, let me know as well.</p>
<p>thanks. ondrej</p>

There are a few things I think I&rsquo;d correct — I&rsquo;m not an expert by any means so take my words as pointers and not facts&hellip; :)
I think you need to do a slight bit of optical correction. Although this is a monoline design, the eye sees vertical and horizontal strokes differently, which means you need to compensate in the design to make it look optically monoline. I&rsquo;m trying to find Mark Jamra&rsquo;s article on optical correction but getting a 404 error. Anyway, the verticals need a few units thicker strokes, as well as the 3 and 9 o&rsquo;clock positions on round glyphs.
I notice you&rsquo;ve added overshoot on the round glyphs; but you also need a little on the round baseline terminals, so they look on the same baseline as for example the bottom stroke of L.
Crossbar of G looks a bit long? M is rather narrow.
I guess your tittles are intentionally rather large but I find them a bit distracting, though I do like the inky effect.
Have you tried a different design for Kk? 
Arches of m look a bit dark.
Lowercase u looks a bit wide and y looks a bit sheared to the right somehow.
Numerals are really nice. 9 looks disproportioned though.
Spacing needs a bit of work to even out.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing this progress. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">hi bendy, thank you for your comments!
i am very well aware of the optical problems with fonts and i already did make some corrections in the version you saw on the pdf. the rings are thicker on the sides, many of the horizontals are thinner, but now i see that it&rsquo;s probably not enough. this was a four-afternoons work and i didn&rsquo;t have chance to print a single proof, so i&rsquo;ll trust you on this. 
you are right, there are no overshoots on the rounded endings of the strokes. the thing is i needed to get this done very quickly, so i used round upm values for almost everything. the overshoot is 10, the thickness of the verticals is 100 and the horizontals are 95 :) all these will need some more work and tuning, however on the other hand, this roughness along with the big tittles and numbers gave the font quite nice character.
i&rsquo;ll examine closely the letters you mentioned. many of the proportions are based on the &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; principle i tried to apply to this font. that&rsquo;s why the M is the same width as N, or K &amp; k are designed the way they are. 9 is a special case, i agree, it looks disproportioned, but only when it stands alone. in a group with other figures, it really adds life to the image, what do you think?
thank you very much again, i&rsquo;ll try to post updated version asap.
cheers, ondrej.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmm, I do like the simple, inexact texture. It gives a nice printy, inky feel, with much more character than the standard rounded geometric fonts out there. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how you reconcile the liveliness with optical balance.</p>
<p>I think your word space is a little on the narrow side and the emdash looks low. (But that could also add charm of course.)</p>

I love its balance between being quite clean, and very personable/likeable.</p>
<p>Some impressions (but bear in mind I&rsquo;m not the most experienced type designer in the room):</p>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if &ldquo;f&rdquo; seems a bit unhappy with the centered crossbar. Did you try making it shorter on the left (kind of like in the &ldquo;t&rdquo;)?</li>
<li>&ldquo;m&rdquo;: Due to the way the stem/arch joins work, the first one is more tapered/thinned than the second. Not sure if that works – seems a bit imbalanced.</li>
<li>I agree with Bendy that the crossbar of &ldquo;G&rdquo; seems long.</li>
<li>&ldquo;M&rdquo; is a bit on the narrow side (then again, the intersection <em>is</em> high).</li>
<li>Joins in &ldquo;V&rdquo;/&ldquo;W&rdquo; might be a bit dark.</li>
<li>The diæreses might be <em>too</em> overpowering, but I&rsquo;d have to see them in context.</li>
<li>The bottom part of the germandbls is too wide; it doesn&rsquo;t (and usually can&rsquo;t) be the same width as the &ldquo;s&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;loop&rdquo; formed where the 2 glyphs meet in the &ldquo;ct&rdquo;, &ldquo;sp&rdquo; and &ldquo;st&rdquo; ligatures looks a bit alien to me, in the sense that suddenly a &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; and &ldquo;pen direction&rdquo; can be felt. Compare to the typographic/&ldquo;directionless&rdquo; rigidity of the other ligatures (which I think works better). I think I&rsquo;d ditch the &ldquo;loop&rdquo; and try a simple shear.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most of all please do keep working on this. I&rsquo;d love to have it, for one :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is really neat! I like a lot of things like the ampersand, the big J serif, the straight arm of the r, the dingbats and especially the numerals.</p>
<p>I think your optical correction for the rounds is just right. It&rsquo;s only the straight horizontals that could stand a tiny bit more thinning.</p>
<p>The S, though&hellip; The S is noticeably top-heavy and and leaning to the right.</p>
