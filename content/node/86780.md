  body: "Hi Hector & welcome to Typophile. According to [[http://www.fontshop.com/education/pdf/typographers_glossary.pdf|The
    Typographer\u2019s Glossary]] 'OpenType Pro fonts share the same technical specifications
    as OpenType Standard (Std, or simply OT) fonts, but support a broader range of
    languages. Standard OT fonts contain support for Western languages, while Pro
    fonts include Central European and often Latin Extended, and often Greek and/or
    Cyrillic and Extended Cyrillic.'\r\n\r\nSB"
