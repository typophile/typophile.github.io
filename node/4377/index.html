		<div class="commentbody">I think this can become a pretty solid font - the idiosyncracies &#40;like the &#34;f&#34;&#41; keep it from being too generic. One thing I&#39;d worry about though is the vertical proportions: for diagram work you might like a bigger x-height, although that will make it less elegant. The caps are somewhat large, but that might actually be a good thing for display work. <BR> <BR>In the UC, the only problem I see is the &#34;Q&#34;: I agree with it being non-descending, but then you should try having an internal part to the tail. Actually, I&#39;d change the &#34;I&#34; as well: for technical labeling serifs would help legibility. <BR> <BR>In the lc: <BR>- The &#34;a&#34; looks... dorky. Not sure how to fix it. <BR>- I&#39;d raise the dots on &#34;i&#34; and &#34;j&#34; &#40;except if you&#39;ll be pulling in the extenders&#41;. <BR>- The &#34;k&#34; isn&#39;t working. <BR>- The beak of the &#34;r&#34; is big, but if you keep the spacing loose &#40;since it&#39;s a light face&#41; it might work. <BR>- The &#34;s&#34; can have a small head, but I&#39;d make the whole more circular - like in Futura. <BR>- The &#34;y&#34; is too small. <BR>- The &#34;z&#34; is leaning right. <BR> <BR>Numerals: to me they seem too mannered. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Darker weights: you&#39;ll have to do a lot of modulation at the joins. <BR>Italics: a sensitive slanted-Roman seems in order, maybe with some shears at the terminals <BR> <BR>Keep at it! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everybody! <BR> <BR>Meir, I appreciate the encouragement, and suggestions. <BR> <BR>Hrant, thanks for making such a detailed analysis. <BR> <BR>Addison, this is a &#39;challenging side project&#39; rooted in percieved need. Of course I hope that this can find <i>real</i> use for <i>real</i> need. The definition of the problem, the whys and the rules helps me get out of my own way and concentrate on the <i>doing</i>. I don&#39;t just want to say <i>I want to make a geometric sans</i> because it doesn&#39;t supply me enough traction. <BR> <BR>I am definitely going to re-visit &#39;Q&#39; , UC &#39;I&#39; ,&#39;k&#39; and &#39;s&#39;. The idea of a more circular whole for the &#39;s&#39; is useful idea and I want to explore that. I see the tipping &#39;z&#39; now, funny how that kind of thing can disappear on you. <BR> <BR>The &#39;a&#39;... well I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say <b>dorky</b>, but I also don&#39;t think I am totally happy with it. I want to keep it two-stories though, that&#39;s for sure. I have a couple ideas I will explore. <BR> <BR>Hrant, if my numerals are too mannered do I fix it by encouraging them to be ill-mannered? :-&#41; Kidding aside, I suspect this is because when I was a draftsman I prided myself on my numerals. I&#39;m not sure I have an idea or reference point about where to go with them. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR><i>Can&#39;t wait to see a text sample</i> <BR> <BR>Me too.</div>

At the least make the bar longer. <BR>- The 6 and 9 seem too big in the bowl. <BR>- Like the 5, the 7&#39;s point is too much. Plus I might pull in &#40;and maybe flatten&#41; the main stroke. <BR>- The 8 is squooshed. I know you don&#39;t want to make it too small though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are indeed pros to long descenders, and in some cases it makes great sense. But the &#34;limited vertical space&#34; con you mention is sort of an extreme manifestation of a much broader functional requirement leading to the need to make descenders notably shorter than ascenders in any &#34;real&#34; text face: <BR> <BR>Since economy is <i>always</i> a factor &#40;to some extent&#41;, and you need the apparent leading to be <i>just right</i> to ease &#34;linefeeds&#34; but without waste, optimal usage of the vertical space has a direct bearing on functional merit; it&#39;s not really that you want to avoid lines touching &#40;which can only happen with very narrow measure&#41;, it&#39;s simply that the space you give to the descender zone might be better used elsewhere. <BR> <BR>As you say though it&#39;s a matter of balance, as always. It seems to me that the pivotal character is the &#34;g&#34;; generally it must look <i>slightly</i> cramped for the balance of Cartesian usage versus overall aesthetic integrity to be good for text. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jon,  I tried to imagine what the typeface would look like in the context of a map or library label. All-caps settings tend to be used often &#40;for headings, tables, etc.&#41; and I think the uneven width of your capital letters would look somewhat awkward. Shrinking the W and M would help; make the narrow glyphs &#40;B, P, R, U, V&#41; a little wider so they&#39;ll sit nicer next to the wide round letters; but don&#39;t compress the round glyphs or you&#39;ll kill the geometric quality. The R needs work -- it looks like a B with the bottom chopped off, and a straight leg would suit your intent better. <BR> <BR>The number 1 should have a wider &#34;beak,&#34; &#40;and maybe a &#34;foot&#34;&#41; for the same reasons. <BR> <BR>I like Avenir but it&#39;s been getting overused, so I&#39;m interested to see where you take this. I think there is a niche for a font that has the &#34;flavor&#34; of Avenir but is tailored for a certain function. &#40;Hmm, I wonder, what&#39;s the flavor of Avenir... does it taste like Cool Mint Listerine, chewable vitamin C tablets, a raspberry Stoli &amp; soda?&#41; <BR> <BR>//john</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, Thanks for your input. Perfectly timed as I revisit the many aspects of this project. It is very true that all caps is common in labelling on maps and in libraries, and your advice makes a great deal of sense in this respect. <BR> <BR>When I drew the glyphs it was of great concern to me that I not end up with another Futura. I like Avenir a lot, and was making decisions on some of the glyphs like &#39;f&#39; and &#39;R&#39; to intenionally diverge from the path. <BR> <BR>Your suggestions strike a chord with me and I will give them serious thought. <BR> <BR>To my thinking Avenir = Cool Mint Listerine &#40;minty with a little hint of medicine&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well I finally carved out some time to return to this.

I have redrawn many of the letters, incorporating many of the suggestions here (an improvement for sure). Here's the deal:
- Narrowed the 'W' and 'M'
- redrew the 's' which is more geometric now, but I'm afraid is too narrow
- Just noticed that the uc 'S' needs to be redrawn too, especially its tail.
- terminated the hook in the 'J' and 'j' earlier and they look nicer now.
- K as noted in an earlier post
- uc 'i' has bars on it but I got scared and they look knobby. Same with 'J'.
- lc 'a' is now a single storey (sigh) which works better.
- 'Q' has a new tail.
- lc 'L' stroke too thick and 'X' strokes too thin.
- also redrew the lc 'y' and shortened its extender.

I took the drawings into TypeTool and generated this font. The sample was made with the newly generated font in Illustrator and converted to outlines for the PDF so I didn't run into any weirdness. I did some ignorant kerning and spacing but I have never used a font editor before so this is obviously crude. No punctuation or numerals have been revised since the earlier drawings and are not in the font at this time.

Are W and M narrow enough now? Should I straighten the leg of the R? Please comment on anything as you see fit.

The 'R' looks awkward, but I don't think the leg must be straightened necessarily. I think it just needs to join a little further to the left.

The 'A' and 'V' should match; you can see the problem in 'ARRIVALS.' A compromise between the two angles you have now would probably be best for this face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Kevin,

I see the angle problem in ARRIVALS, that's a fair point. I'll try adjusting these.

<em>Well, now it’s redundant. The original two-storey ‘a’ and ‘s’ gave this face an identity and a reason to exist</em>

Am I right in understanding that you think I have moved too close to other geo-sans by changing this ? I suspect I am wrestling with the originality/usefulness problem. Iaadmit that the single storey a is much more pedestrian but may be more useful in the intended application of labelling etc.. I think the s is improved though.

I am going to see if there's something I can do with the R. I like the curved leg and will keep it. I'll try your suggestion about moving the join.

Thanks for your time and comments!

		<div class="commentbody">You are correct, and I actually think it's more of a utility thing! When I saw your initial post, I thought to myself, "Excellent, someone has <em>fixed</em> the <em>legibility problem</em> common to many geometric sans." <em>Especially</em> for labelling. Whether at small screen sizes, small print with ink gain, lacking one's reading glasses, or just from glancing at it too fast, there is a huge potential for 'a'/'o' confusion. If the tiny words in your gif were out of context, on a map, for instance, I honestly wouldn't know if I were looking at 'Rambas Tocos' or what.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Kevin,

Thanks for this. I went to the single story a after a lot of back and forthing and not feeling right about it either way.

I am going to do some studies on the a and see if I can find something that is better. I'll share when I get some good comparisons.
