  about serif/sans serif font choices.\r\n\r\nThe impression I want to give: warm,
  yet distinguished. Nothing cold or sterile. \r\n\r\nMy ideas so far: \r\n\r\n1.
  Dolly paired with Auto (or Formata?)\r\n2. Freight Text Medium paired with Freight
  Sans\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward using Dolly, at least. I'd love to see just how much
  mileage I can get out of that beauty, but I'm open to all suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is a nice typeface but not soft and warm enough I think.\r\nPieter"

  body: "Thank you!  \r\n\r\nYes, Dolly and Auto are a wonderful pair after all. My
    only problem was that the bold weight of Auto was rather overpowering (for subheads),
    so I simply increased the point size of the reqgular weight and made everything
    flush-left for more uniformity. Made a world of difference.  \r\n\r\n"

    by a recruiter for using Times New Roman for my resume in an application for a
    design position. I would have agreed with him except my only option for submitting
    for the position was in in a Word format. I guess I could have used Arial?"

      quite funny, but since everyone was applying through Word docs, the recruiters
      most likely knew this and were trying to catch a designer off beat.  (file under:

  body: "roballoo:\r\n\r\nI'm sure the humour of this isn't lost on you: you used
    TNR on a resume for a *design* position. In any case, Arial would probably have
    been an even worse choice. At least TNR is an original, though drawing from a
    tradition which includes Plantin, I believe. Arial, however, is a poorly-executed
    knockoff of Helvetica and is universally hated in the design world.\r\n\r\nI've
    never applied for a design position - it isn't my field, although I feel that
    nearly all written matter should be \"designed\" to some degree. Just good typography.
    I suspeect that you'd be better off investing in some quality fonts from houses
    such as, say, Underware, Porchez Typefonderie, etc. StormType is another producer
    of great fonts that can cover all your needs quite easily."

    Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n<cite>>(file under: testing skills through curveballs)</cite>\r\nSpeaking
    of curveballs, even though the job description said they were looking for a \"Sr.
    graphic Artist,\" they were really looking for someone who could hit the ground
    running as a C++ programmer. It was a very strange experience talking to the recuiter.
    Needless to say I was a bit underqualified for the position.\r\n"

    is suitable for every industry.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for warm and distinguished,
    consider Galliard. It is familiar to the reader, yet in another league, and the
    italic is individual.\r\n\r\nArrus is also a good choice, graceful and warm.\r\n"
