  lettering, not remakes of.\r\nThe \"Vespa\" style is what I'd really like to find
  more of. Car logos have been my best resource so far,\r\nbut industrial style product
  \ or company logos would really be good.  Attached is some of what I've found.\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated.\r\nThanks,\r\nDan Cotton\r\n"
