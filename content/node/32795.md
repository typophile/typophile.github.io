  booklet. The number of illustrations could vary from 25 to 60 illustrations. I was
  wondering what/how I should charge the client - by the hour? by the illustration?\r\n\r\nThey
  will be produced in grayscale, as the client would like to keep the printing costs
  down as much as possible. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advace
  for your assistance."

    since it can depend on the sort of detail the client wants (simple pen and ink
    vs. cross-hatching, etc.): by the hour works as well, Mark.'

  body: "Thank you very much for the information. It never dawned on me that I hadn't
    explained the situation completely. I didn't take traditional media into account.\r\n\r\nI
    will be provided photos in the various stages of use. I will be using those images
    as templates in Illustrator for the illustrations. Textures and shades of black
    will be used for visual break up/interest. Does that change anything?\r\n\r\nThe
    price I was thinking of charging was $65/hr."

    I'm letting my old-fartedness show.  ;-)\r\n\r\n<em>I will be using those images

    media might be newer, but I'm not sure the time required to do them in Illustrator
    would be all that different: you might get some time-saving by using AutoTrace,
    but you still have to tinker with that, or draw 'em from scratch, which certainly
    wouldn't be much different than using pen and paper, at least in the first iteration.\r\n\r\nWhere
    you'd really see a difference is if there are changes to be made -- much cleaner
    on the computer, since you'd never have to start from square one.\r\n\r\nGiven
    where you are, $65/hour sounds about right...."
