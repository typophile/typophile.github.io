body: 'hi everyone,  <BR> <BR>i&#39;m new to the site. i&#39;m a graphic design student
  about to graduate. i have always loved typography and as one of my projects for
  portfolio class, i&#39;m doing something i have wanted to do for awhile - create
  a new font. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s the deal: i&#39;m doing a tribute to bodoni. it&#39;s
  a bracketed semi-serif. &#40;this is my favorite serif typeface&#41; i started out
  with drawings and have moved to digital. so far, i&#39;ve only digitized the lowercase.
  i am very new to this, so i&#39;m looking for any feedback you guys can offer. however,
  i&#39;m looking for answers not only regarding the typeface itself, but also on
  issues like: what it should be named?, has anyone already done a tribute like this
  one?, and anything else that i may need to know in dealing with a tribute.  <BR>
  <BR>so that&#39;s it, i&#39;m looking forward to the feedback. <BR> <BR>thanks!
