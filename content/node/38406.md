body: "The Font Bureau face [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless|Stainless]]
  is pretty nice. My only gripe is that it has no italic that I can tell. Do any of
  you guys know of any fonts that are a similar design and have an italic?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stainless_3465.gif]"

  body: Might be worth contacting Font Bureau to see if an italic is available. I
    was able to license the italics for Benton Sans before they were displayed on
    the FB web site.

    often. I know that whenever they do, people always tout <a href=http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html>Klavika</a>
    as their favorite.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There are a bunch more in <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/28458>this
    thread</a>. I did some searching for you, and all the types mentioned except for
    Cachet have italics.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Oops, sent down to the bottom."
