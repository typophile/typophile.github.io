body: i&#39;m having a devil of a job getting &#39;non-keyboard&#39;characters such
  as ligatures, em dashes etc into illustrator, &amp; was wondering if anyone could
  help me. <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve tried pasting/drag-dropping from Character Map, and the
  alt&#43;# method without any success. when i paste the character directly from another
  app, illustrator rather unhelpfully displays an &#39;?&#39;.  <BR> <BR>i&#39;m running
  illustrator 9 on a PC. any suggestions welcome. <BR> <BR>thanks, geraint

  body: I was having same problems with inserting square root symbol into Illustrator.
    No luck. Had to do it via InD - pasted in there, converted to curves, pasted as
    curves into Illustrator. No other way.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: If illustrator is giving you a question mark for special characters it means
    those characters are out of the first 256 glyph range and are unicode.  Illustrator
    doesn&#39;t understand unicode yet.  Though as someone said, if you have InDesign
    you can take it in there and create outlines.  InDesign is fully unicode aware.
    <BR> <BR>One thing though, I know the ligatures are out of the 256 glyph range
    on normal fonts, but em dashes are alt&#43;0151, they should work fine.   <BR>
    <BR>Also, you can try doing Smart Punctuation and seeing if Illustrator will change
    it for you.  It&#39;s under the type menu.
