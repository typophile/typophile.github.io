    does it have to be anything more than a 'generic' sans W? It certainly wasn't
    from a digital font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Could you explain to me what are you talking about when you say 'generic'
    sans W ?\r\nEach caracter is part of a typeface family didn't it ?\r\nAs some
    typefaces have been made during the 15-16th centuries, if there is \"olny\" 50
    years ago it's not as long as that no?\r\nThanks for lighting up my brain of very
    beginner typefaces lover.\r\n:)"

    necessarily. Often just single (or few) letters are needed, thus designed."

  body: "My comment about the 'generic' sans was just that almost any sans would have
    a W like that. I also think if you were to ask almost anyone to draw a W, that
    is the shape you would get -- so in that sense it is 'generic' too.\r\n\r\nMy
    other point in mentioning 50 years, is that the photo is clearly from a pre-digital
    era, so font, the way most of us use it isn't so applicable. Many pre-digital
    typefaces were never made into digital fonts.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps explain
    my remarks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of type or font as a model, when they made large signs like that."

    the shape anyone would draw to represent a block W, as some call it. If you were
    to use a ruler to draw a W, isn't that what you would produce?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
