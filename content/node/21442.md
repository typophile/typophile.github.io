body: My friend is a Magician/Sideshow/Fire Performer and desperately needs an identity/logo
  type plus promotional materials. This is what I have for him so far, he saw a rough
  comp where I didn't have any of the typefaces, but I've since bought the fonts and
  done some iterations. I need your input, the forums were down exactly when I wanted
  to post this! We've not decided if he's going to use colors or just keep with the
  black and white/grey theme. I know these aren't EXACT sizes of biz cards yet, but
  I need to nail the details first. Thanks!

  body: "I like it. Use of playing card motif is very eye catching and appropriate.
    The phone number spacing looks kinda tight. Also, its really hard to read the
    @ symbol--it was hard for me to catch on that what I was reading was an email
    address. Also, kerning on Master Magician could use some work (but maybe you're
    not there yet). Looks great in B&W, but adding color would look sweet too. Or
    reflective silver ink!\r\n\r\nI like the silver backside. The white spade in the
    upper left balances better than the black spade next to the name, but having more
    black on the frontside of the card adds something. Maybe try right justifying
    the contact details to balance the spade in the upperleft?\r\n\r\nWhat you have
    is really good--keep working at it!\r\n\r\nEron"

  body: I hung out with Barry tonight and he likes the direction as well, I need to
    add some more copy though. He wants to list some of the acts he does. Will update
    this again soon. Thanks for the positive remarks/comments, Eron.

  body: "I'm not too sure about the combination of typefaces, or at least the proximity
    of the artsy crafty one with the tuscan one seems kind of Aleister Crowley and
    the other showbizzy, having glanced at the sideshow website I assume that you
    wanted to imply both, it's the closeness of the two that bothers me. The alignment
    (without the spade) doesn't work for me either, I can see that you have centred
    Silver on the address details but it seems kind of left heavy, maybe moving the
    Master Magician away would help or changing the order so that the name is near
    the vertical centre and the descriptor was more connected to the address, which
    needs to be kerned out. On a production issue if you do decide to go two colour
    (rather than a tint) your keylines might suffer from registration errors. Obviously
    you have a lot of work to do in drawing the ornate spade device but however you
    work it out I think you should look at using elements from it in the monogram
    in the corners the circles seem to simple to me.\r\nTim"

  body: The little BS monogram lacks coherence, especially with the M's stuck in wherever
    you could fit them. It sort of reads "Bm mS". You may want to simplify that as
    much as you can, down to the two letters or even just one.

    no rushing deadline for the project so I only have time to work on it here and
    there.

  body: "After seeing the \"torture acts\" listed on the card, the whole design seems
    sort of tame. I think the design could have a little more bite to it. I know it
    sounds clich\xE9, but maybe some tribal tattoo influence or something. Even hand-drawing
    the monogram may help.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Lex, the interesting thing is that Barry is a pretty 'normal' run of the mill
    guy. No tattoos or crazy costumes or piercings. This is kinda why I went with
    a more clean approach because going in the direction you mentioned would conflict
    with the fact that this 'normal' guy is doing all these crazy acts.
