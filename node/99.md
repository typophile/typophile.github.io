  right away.. <BR> <BR>So, there is a logo. Quite....hmm... generic. As generic as
  the business&#40;es&#41; the company has. Will be applied mostly on stationery and
  printed matter, as well as web &#40;naturally&#41;. That&#39;s it. Nothing really
  &#34;extraordinaire&#34;. <BR>Anyway. Here is the logo: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10647.gif"
  alt="image"> <BR> <BR>WITAL wording was done earlier. Initially it was meant for
  being in the upper part alone, as the lower part was meant for the sub-companys
  &#40;Like, WITAL Air Cargo, for examply, or... WITAL Development, etc&#41;. Now
  that the company merged with another company, the SPRIT wording should go into the
  upper part. This is exactly where my problems lies. <BR>What d&#39;you think?'

  body: Stephen, you are the first one to actually say, that No.1 is better. The client
    trusts me in those things &#40;wow&#41;, and he even regrets &#34;sprit&#34; coming
    in the name of the company ^_^ <BR>Anyways.. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    I had some difficulties, though, with this Bodoni. I didn&#39;t really want to
    use it in the first place. That was client&#39;s request. For his own reasons
    - no idea why. <BR>Franklin Gothic though is used for the lower part of the logo
    - and I am happy with that. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    The site is still being built, but you can see the other logos there. <BR>I&#39;ll
    think about the bold version.

  body: I would say Franklin Gothic. But, I would use a smaller point size and a thinner
    weight. Uppercase appears also to work best in this instance. For whatever reason,
    Helvetica appars stuffy and not comfortable with the pairing here. I also agree
    with Stephen about the thins on your bodoni. Can the client afford two weights?
    I would recommend ITC Bodoni 72 for larger versions and the 12 for smaller. <BR>
    <BR>Bodoni is narrow, here, and the helvetica seems wide. The franklin gothic
    is of the same width, relatively, with the bodoni. And with the exactness in the
    bodoni&#39;s construction, I would also say that Franklin is more exact, ergo
    geometric, than is helvetica. It seems the word &#39;sprit&#39; either needs to
    line up with then end of the &#39;L&#39; or not. I&#39;m thinking that perfect
    alignment might be nicer. <BR> <BR>Also, if you could use a bodoni with a bit
    thicker thins there could be more evenness in color. As it is you have three different
    weights of stroke, the letters have nothing in common. <BR> <BR>I will say that
    I really like severity and simplicity of it. And I for one miss the use of the
    color red. I miss franklin and bodoni as well. I&#39;d say that your client should
    regret adding &#39;sprit&#39; if anything that is the problem here not type selection.
    <BR> <BR>Very nice. Stick around. The more the merrier.

  body: You could mention to them that they are resizing their logo &#40;witallogo.gif,
    from 108x110 pixels to 109x110 pixels&#41; on the main page of their site, causing
    all sorts of horrible contortions &#40;quite notably in the &#34;A,&#34; or inverted
    &#34;V,&#34; or whatever that is&#41;. <BR> <BR>I have seen the best logos of
    my generation destroyed by html rescaling!

  body: Well, they were designed with commercial interest, and people have paid -and
    continue to pay- money for them, so I&#39;m not sure &#34;experimental&#34; is
    right. But in terms of user functionality there&#39;s certainly a lot of wishful
    thinking in both. <BR> <BR>BTW, whoever said Bodoni is a bad choice on-screen
    is right. <BR>High stroke contrast and low rendering fidelity don&#39;t mix. <BR>And
    check out that wonderful Helvetica &#34;R&#34;!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Bodoni is not a good coice for a Logo that could -- e.g. if your company
    acts as a sponsor for something -- always end up being printed rather small. If
    you keep the Bodoni, you should manually work a bit on the hairlines to make the
    stand out more, maybe come up with different versions of the logo for different
    sizes of usage, as Stephen suggested. <BR>Also, Helvetica and Bodoni, although
    the pair looks good here, is a bad mix, as both types share the same classical
    background, both having rather static forms. If you WANT that, great... but if
    not you could try a sans-serif-typeface that has a constructed character, such
    as Futura or Century or Neutraface, which has wonderful upper case letters :-D.
    The constructed geometric should make a nice contrast to the static, but still
    not fully non-human look of the bodoni. An american-goth type like Franklin or,
    even worse, a sans-serif based on humanistic renaissance principles &#40;such
    as Frutiger, Gill et all&#41;, is out of the question... the dynamic style would
    not contrast the stiff but lively Bodoni at all.  <BR> <BR>What is very nice about
    mixing Bodoni and Helvetica is the ironic mix of a&#41; two over-used types and
    b&#41; the clash of a very emotional and a very technical/practical typeface.  <BR>
    <BR>Other than that it&#39;s classical, simple, the double rectangle motif is
    something you can play with on brilliantly later-on... it also has a touch of
    humour. I like it. '

  body: what a hot discussion.... <BR>Paul, thank you for the rescaling bug you noticed.
    I&#39;m also building the site for them, so I&#39;ve just corrected the width
    value. I&#39;d never noticed that. ! <BR> <BR>As for Bodoni being a parody - unfortunately
    I cannot add anything to that, either positive or negative. I cannot say I hate
    Bodoni, but the more I work with it, the more I like it. hmm.. <BR>&#34;Hairlines
    in small sizes&#34; problem is not really a problem. The only imaginable application
    for the logo in small sizes is a business card. It won&#39;t go smaller than that.
    It works okay there. <BR>Bodoni&amp;Futura was shouted out several times. I am
    sorry, but it just doesn&#39;t work for me with these words. Looks horrible. As
    well as Avenir. Frutiger wasn&#39;t even tried out. I dunno...
