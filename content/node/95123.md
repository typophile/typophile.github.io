body: "The typeface I'm working on is a redesign of my own font I made a while back,
  an extra-expanded, futuristic font that I've decided to bring back to the chopping
  block and make something more valueable from it. I ended up making something entirely
  new and here it is - Cepheid.\r\n\r\nThe typeface includes only capitals, latin
  + some diacritics + cyrillic letters and of course punctuation, all normal and italics.
  The design is meant to be futuristic, yet quite versatile - that's why I tried to
  minimize the \"oddities\" while maintaining the unique look. It's still much of
  a 'work in progress', still working on the geometry of the letters so I haven't
  touched much of the kerning yet.\r\n\r\nAny advice appreciated of course!\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "Just a couple of thoughts: \r\nI would move the cut on |O| and |o| to the
    upper right, to further differentiate them from |D| and at the same time nodding
    to their cursive forms.\r\nYour |\u0424| looks a bit small. I recently learned
    on this same forum it\u2019s an accepted practice to extend the center stem above
    caps height and below the baseline in order to make room for the bowl."
