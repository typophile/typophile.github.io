  body: "profonts seems to have built up a collection of revivals of old typefaces
    from pre-digital days. This lettering resembles many of those brush-drawn scripts
    from the 60's, and profonts [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/sonora/|Sonora]]
    seems to be based on one of them. Notice how many of these letters are similar
    in shape and 'feel' to the lettering in this ad. I don't think Sonora was what
    was actually used, but it comes from the same 'family' of pre-digital lettering.
    The Solotype Catalog shows dozens of these styles, each with a variation of letter
    slant, stroke thickness, or lettering style variation ( script or printed s and
    r, for example). URW also has digitzed some of these, as has Bitstream, with the
    \"Freehand\" styles. Note that [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/freehand-575/|Freehand
    575]], which has also been known as Jefferson Script, also looks like it has features
    in common with this ad lettering. In fact, I might suggest Freehand 575, if no
    one finds a better match. Many revivals of scripts from this period have been
    made. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
