  it costing an arm and a leg? I am looking to get my portfolio printed, with double
  processing and would really love to get crisp results on the text.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Most any traditional printing (mechanical printing vs. digital) has an exponential
    pricing structure where the more you print, the cheaper the overall per-unit price
    is.\r\n\r\nOne way to save with letterpress would be to go with polymer plates
    instead of hand-set type (assuming you are outsourcing this...if it's DIY, then
    setting your own type would be cheaper)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Cheers! I have spoken to a few printers and it looks like I would need to
    call it a pass for now.. Looking into other manual(non-digital) printing techniques.
    Temped, yet apprehensive about screen printing.
