  body: "I'm intrigued by the swashes between the lines \"until that time. / Send
    me. . . \" and the signature. I'm trying to imagine when (in the writing) one
    added these. The Signature swash seems to grow out of the \"M,\" but it wraps
    around \"Ketchum\" in a way that suggests the name had been written by the time
    the swash surrounded it. The prior swash seems to function as the crossbar of
    the \"t\" in \"time,\" but it aligns with other crossbars, and perhaps corsses
    the \"t\" in \"the bill.\"\r\n\r\nQuin, as best I can puzzle it out, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\nCapt.

    for entertainment value).\r\n\r\n<strong>Letter to Captain Higbee of the Vapor</strong>
    \  \r\nUtterly maniacle everyday cursive hand from the late 18th century with
    expressive if rather over-enthusiastic pen manner. Existing on the margins of
    outright stupefaction but still posessing a fundamental coolness that modern handwriting
    just doesn't have. Pressure-induced changes in stroke width, character size variation
    visible from space and hedge-threatening understeer present a daunting challenge
    to digitzation.\r\n<strong>Spec notes:</strong> All but j, q and z are present,
    but alarming lack of capitals means Jimmy Cat will need to study loads of similar
    writing from the period.\r\n<strong>Completion date:</strong> Not distant enough\r\n<strong>Rivals:</strong>
    P22 Cezanne, Lamar Pen, Houston Pen, Emily Austen, A good fountain pen\r\n<strong>But
    also try:</strong> A nice sit down and a cup of tea.\r\n<strong>My choice:</strong>
    Provided I don't intend to finish working on it before 2020, why not?\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the high res pic the plot gets a lot thicker. Do I seriously believe it can
    be made into a font? Maybe, maybe not. At this early stage I think the basic effect
    of the letter can be wrought in font form, but a full-blown emulation with all
    eccentricities may prove impossible. \r\n\r\nI'll keep you posted.\r\n\r\nj a

    and can imagine how a practiced hand would produce that sort of linear congruence.
    I often find that my own (unskilled) handwriting produces parallel lines and harmonious
    swashes that I could never have drawn by deliberate effort; it's delightful to
    see Ketchum's hand at work. This is an effect that OpenType may approximate, but
    will never equal.\r\n"
