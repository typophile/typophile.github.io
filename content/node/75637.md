  I like it but I like it alot more when it has been squashed a little, does anyone
  else like this or have I done a aweful crime?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fourmation_4363.png]"

  body: Typically squashing is a sin, but I don't think it looks bad in this case.

  body: I would think you'll need to do some weight adjustments, e.g. since /M/'s
    strokes are all at or closer to vertical (the direction that doesn't get thinned
    with the squooshing) it winds up too heavy to my eye.

  body: "Squishing it wrecks the horizontal/vertical weight relationships in most
    letters and screws up the counter balance in F, R, and A. So\u2026just don\u2019t
    do this."

  body: Well, I don't know the legality of this, but you could try interpolating it
    with a bolder weight after squishing it, to get the horizontals right, and then
    tweak all the issues.

  body: 'It needs some fixing but I think it will look good. Couldn''t you cut some
    of the horizontals from the original version to repair the squashed ones? You
    wouldn''t lose the horizontal/vertical relationship if you reduce the height of
    each letter individually using groups of points, rather than squashing the complete
    word. '

  body: "Maybe use <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/eurostile_std_extended_bold_2/?&sample_text=FOURMATION&acs_pt=32&update=0&affid=99346\">Eurostile
    Extended</a> if you want something this wide. You might have an easier time adjusting
    that to your needs than correcting a squashed Forza.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you
    have the budget, the best course of action is requesting a customization from
    the type designer (H&FJ)."

  body: Yes. If you want to keep the 'MA' from touching, everything else will have
    to loosen up quite a bit. Squint your eyes and note the negative space.
