  body: "As I understand, based on review of the alphabet standardised by the Guaran\xED
    language congress in Uruguay in 1950, Guaran\xED requires eight diacritic characters,
    \xE3 \u1EBD g\u0303 \u0129 \xF1 \xF5 \u0169 \u1EF9, of which one, g\u0303, is
    not encoded in Unicode as a precomposed character so requires use of the combining
    tilde mark character, and hence fonts with appropriate GSUB or GPOS support for
    the sequence g+\u25CC\u0303. In addition, Guaran\xED has a number of digraphs
    that sort as distinct letters, requiring tailored sorting and collation algorithms,
    since these digraphs are not encoded as units but as sequences of normal Unicode
    letter characters.\r\n\r\nSo Guaran\xED requires particular kinds of software
    support, but this is not unusual for Amerindian orthographies or, indeed, for
    many of the world's other languages. The fact that some precomposed diacritic
    combinations are encoded in Unicode, and indeed a few digraph combinations, is
    a technical accident brought about by backwards compatibility requirements. If
    Unicode were starting from scratch with no such requirements, no precomposed diacritics
    would have been encoded, and all languages would be in the same situation as Guaran\xED.
    Personally, I think that would have been a good thing, because it would have impelled
    software makers in North America and Europe to produce the kind of text processing
    solutions that Guaran\xED and many other languages need."
