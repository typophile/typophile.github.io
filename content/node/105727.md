body: "I'm looking for Cyrillic fonts that have a \"forked\" yat similar to the ones
  in Old Standard v2 or Linux Libertine. The intended use is for the web rather than
  print, so unfortunately that rules out a high-contrast face like Old Standard.\r\n\r\nI've
  already browsed all of the serif faces at http://paratype.com that supports 19th-century
  Russian orthography, and have also looked at just about everything at http://free.type.org.ua/en/.
  The forked variant of the yat character seems to be pretty rare.\r\n\r\nLinux Libertine
  has a fairly neutral appearance that would be OK for the intended use, and the yat
  fits the pre-revolutionary feeling I have in mind. However, there's something about
  the high bar in the lowercase \"e\" that says \"not a traditional Cyrillic letter
  form\". So I wonder whether Libertine is considered to be a good or bad face for
  Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nSomething like Leksa would be great -- but as far as I can tell
  it lacks the yat variant I'm seeking (unless there's a stylistic variant that's
  not shown in the glyph maps).\r\n\r\nAny opinions welcome. Thanks!"

  body: Ah. I didn't register the comment about high contrast typefaces. But the forked
    yat is very much of that style, and will be much less common in other styles.
