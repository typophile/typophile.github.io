  restore a shirt. Actually I only need the 4 and the number 1.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone
  can help me. The number is well known in the sports world. But for some reason I
  can't find it.\r\n\r\nI'm new in here. Trying to make a picture of the numbers vincible..\r\n\r\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4yxhyjbwr/\r\n\r\nhttp://postimg.org/image/f08rkmayf/"

    School USA Serif]]</strong> and add the 3D effect...\r\n\r\n*Edit*: Ryuk suggestion
    is probably a better, ready to use, alternative ;)"
