body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;This is for the SF Chinatown
  Night Market.  They want something that will appeal to corporate sponsors for the
  event, but still allude to the roots of this event.   <BR> <BR>There are two concepts,
  the one I am showing right now focusses more on the Sanf Francisco aspect of the
  event, not so much the NIGHT-MARKETness of the event &#40;that comes later&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think Filosphia is appropriate really, but it says San Francisco
  to me, and I&#39;m including it for that reason. <BR> <BR>The second treatment happened
  kinda by accident, this was used for the chinese characters on the other concept,
  but I liked how it looked with Latin glyphs.  But it seems a little thin, and I
  only have one weight to work with. <BR> <BR>New Clarendon seems to be working the
  best.  Says SF, looks conservative and classic. <BR> <BR>Could try some Sans treatments,
  but since the Chinese characters are more traditional brushstroke I think a serif
  is the way to go. <BR> <BR>Would really love your input/suggestions.  Spent a lot
  of time on the mark/illustration so the type part has got to happen between now
  and tomorrow morning :/ <BR> <BR>Thank a bunch folks. <BR> <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Nice artwork! Of the three you have, the New Caledonia looks the best to me.
    The color seems to blend best with the Chinese characters, and the line you have
    there nicely parallels &#40;in both ways!&#41; the horizontal rooflines. The spacing
    on Filosofia seems too wide to me.

  body: thanks Steve.   <BR> <BR>I forgot to mention that I haven&#39;t done any kerning
    yet, so please disregard those gaps between the A and I.

  body: here&#39;s the other concept.  FF Gothic and Syntax will be used for supporting
    text.  In a strange sort of way FF Gothic looks somewhat &#39;eastern&#39; to
    me.   <BR> <BR>Let me know what you all think as to whether I need to blur/white
    out the area behind the text that runs over the lanterns. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37283.gif"

  body: A once saw a bold condensed sanserif used for a kung fu school. It looked
    great. <BR> <BR>I feel like if you used a san serif face the title wouldn&#39;t
    be competing with the traditional chinese lettering and architecture. <BR> <BR>

  body: Yes, I was going to try a condensed sans, thanks for the reminder. <BR> <BR>That
    is a sans in the middle though &#40;FF Gothic&#41;.  Perhaps the outlines are
    too distracting?

    like them both and was just about to comment on the lack of kerning but then I
    saw you where not there yet...  <BR> <BR>Cant wait to see the finished one...
    any color on the logo?  <BR> <BR>Keep it up <BR> <BR>Mark <BR> <BR>DK

  body: Peter, is this logo only going to appear in San Francisco? If so loose the
    words San Francisco. Also try stacking Chinatown on one line and Night Market
    on a second line they might justify. It could make a nice unit. I prefer the chinese
    laterns, implies light. Over all nice stuff

  body: Yes, this is only an SF sort of thing. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a good idea about
    the stacking, though it ends up covering more of the front lantern, which I haven&#39;t
    been pleased with. <BR> <BR>However, it looks like they want to call it SF Chinatown
    Nightmarket Fair, so a stacking could be in order.  Though I think Fair is redundant.

  body: I agree loose the Fair. If they insist on San  Francisco stack it too and
    make it much smaller. Maybe the lantern&#40;s&#41; could go to the left or right
    side or both of the title, just not behind. Just thoughts

  body: I just had another thought, I know whats bugging me about your artwork, its
    too slick. Keep the lantern&#40;s&#41;, but do them in Chinese ink painting style.
    Black ink on silk with a brush. A trip to the local museum might be in order.

  body: Man, those zwo are pretty. It does look quite timeless and vernacular/retro.  <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure about stacking the word. I ratherlike the horizontal axis that way. And
    although I hate type set in circles and all that... here it fits, so even the
    redundant SAN FRANCISCO adds a nice quaint touch. I&#39;m not sure about ther
    kerning at this size, but apart from that it is really perfect because it doesn&#39;t
    feel perfect and designed and so on.  <BR>

  body: Peter, those are nice logos. I agree with Daniel that the lanterns are best
    for a night market. I really like that and and the type surprised me in a good
    way.  <BR> <BR>Could the lantern design be reversed out of a black, dark red or
    deep blue background? <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR>&#62; Jon, thanks for the feedback. The client decided to
    go with the &#62; Chinatown Entrance. They want to have that credible esteemed
    effect &#62; on potential sponsors of the event. I have a little room to work
    in another element that would perhaps make the this concept more festive. I had
    thought of fireworks, but thus far they haven&#39;t worked out. Could work in
    some stars, but that is more night, and the moon covers that domain. <BR> <BR>Open
    to suggestions...'
