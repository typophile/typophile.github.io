  like to get some feedback on a newspaper ad that will be placed in a regional business
  newspaper that is geared towards small business. The ad measures 3.25 inches wide
  by 3 inches high.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the font and layout?  Any comments
  are appreciated!"

    Gill Sans for some? It''s new, it''s hip, and it''s happening :-) , as opposed
    to overused Gill.'

  body: "It's a pretty centered, safe, immobile design. You want to think especially
    about two things: the center of attention (where a reader's eye will go as soon
    as he/she sees the ad) and the hierarchy (What information is most important?
    The website, the company name, or the company's description? What's slightly less?
    etc.). The most attractive element seems to be the logo, so try to make good use
    of it. Off the top of my head, you could try making it big, nearly the size of
    the page or even bigger, bleeding it off the page. That might make your ad more
    memorable. But you need to also think about legibility, since this is such a small
    ad, so make sure that everything is readable at actual size.\r\n\r\nYou should
    also consider integrating the text and image. Right now, they're pretty separate,
    caused in part by the big separation between elements and the big black bars at
    the top and bottom. See if you can make everything feel like it's part of a whole
    -- again, my quick thought would be to tilt the website name to the angle of one
    side of the mountain and to run the company description below it for the same
    width as the logo.\r\n\r\nReally, what I'm saying is that you may want to take
    some time to play around with what you have. If you don't need to put it in this
    very second, try sketching every layout and idea that comes to mind. You'll likely
    come up with something that, if not brilliant, will be a marked improvement. But
    I'd recommend you keep Palatino Sans -- it fits the company's image nicely. Maybe
    really flaunt it -- have fun with the font. :-) And if you have time, post the
    final result -- I'd love to see it.\r\n\r\nP.S. I don't want to presume that you
    haven't read some of these, but you might like to take a look at the books listed
    in the <a href=http://typophile.com/books/graphicdesign>Typophile Library</a>.
    I haven't read most of them, but I can attest to the great insights and design
    in Paula Scher's <em>Make It Bigger</em>."

  body: Auricfuzz,  Thank you so much for your ideas! I can see now that it looks
    kind of static so I'll work on it today and post the results.

  body: "Okay, here goes.\r\n\r\nA website address just can't be the most important
    thing on this ad, but you have placed it at the top left, where your key selling
    proposition should be. What you need up there is something that will catch the
    eye of the reader, and make them continue to read. I suggest \"Custom Greeting
    Cards\" or something similar.\r\n\r\nThe logo is a nice one, but again, will it
    make people buy? a photo of the product is more likely to do so. Then your sales
    pitch (which will have to be modified if you take the heading out from it). Finally
    your contact information. (The www stuff can go down here.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps it
    will work the way it is, but if it does it will be the exception."

  body: Don, thank you for your feedback.  I'll give that a try.  Unfortunately having
    a photo is   beyond the budget.
