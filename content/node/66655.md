body: "Hello all \u2014 can anyone id the typeface used for L'Auto - V\xE9lo in this
  image? I originally thought it was hand drawn but then came across the same face
  in another book; Cyclists Touring Club. Brittish Road Book. Vol 11, published in
  1898 (trying to source an image). Any ideas welcome. Thanks\r\n\r\nPs. while we're
  at it can anyone id the serif and sans serif used just below L'Auto - V\xE9lo? Thanks
  again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/L'AUTO_PRESSE_PASS_2_4620.jpg]
