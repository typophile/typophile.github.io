  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently working on a logo design for an italian food blog that has to communicate a sense of professionalism and elegance .
After a series of drafts this is what I ended up with. The typefaces I used are a classical italian Bembo and a more sleek and modern Avenir for the more serious text &ldquo;Addiction&rdquo;. I am in a position where I think I can kind of see the potential in the idea, but something is still off, something needs to be improved in order to make the logo shine. 
I need some third eye points of view from the persons of the community, so any feedback/comments about it will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks for the attention</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed your logo gives an air of professionalism and elegance. I like very much the Bembo for &lsquo;Italian&rsquo; word, but when I read &lsquo;addiction&rsquo; is like NOW something wrong is happening. It directs me to a law firm&hellip; Of course, addiction by its meaning is not a positive word, but I would see it as an image, literally an image, which would convey that you &lsquo;stick&rsquo; to it, cannot get rid of it. Therefore, sans serif, for me at least, is not giving this notion to the word. I tried to make &lsquo;Italian&quot; sans serif and &lsquo;addiction&rsquo; serif, but I didn&rsquo;t like it. Somehow, you have to emphasize the notion of &lsquo;addiction&rsquo;. I was thinking of a typeface that would look like being engraved in stone, which would highlight its strong power, &lsquo;of being addicted to something&rsquo;. It would say: now I am engraved in stone, try to get rid of me&hellip; :) 
In the image below I used fonts which I had (Trajan Pro), sorry for that! :( But the middle points are quite roman and in some way emphasize word&rsquo;s strength, especially when you try to read it. It makes you stop between the points. It is just a way of seeing it, not something that I propose. Maybe, the image will lead you to find some new techniques for your logo.
Have you tried making &ldquo;Italian&rdquo; calligraphic, without using any fonts, make it by yourself, an elegant script and &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; in lowercase, serif maybe? 
And by the way, I used a line because you used one. It may be not necessary. But is not bad at all too.

<p>Will you share with me how to make an attachment instead of inserting the image? It saves space on the screen. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">&ldquo;Addiction&rdquo; is a strong word that implies compulsion, strong emotion, etc. Your treatment is too precise and controlled. You might try putting &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; in a totally different font than &ldquo;Italian&rdquo;, perhaps a script that looks strong and energetic.</div>
