  believe that it isn&#39;t though &#40;it doesn&#39;t quite seem to...&#41; so my
  doubt remains. Anyone who can help? Grateful. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25181.gif"

  body: Definitely not Kaufmann, closer to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/raceway/">Raceway</a>
    but not exactly that either. Could be a free Raceway knockoff.

    Gothic Light</a>, spaced rather tightly.

  body: Assuming this is just a logo, the bulge in the right upright of the &#39;u&#39;
    suggests to me that this is <BR>custom drawn. A font maker would likely have kept
    the stroke consistent with the rest. <BR> <BR>Could &#40;always&#41; be wrong,
    though ...

    It often gets confused with Kaufmann and vice-versa.'
