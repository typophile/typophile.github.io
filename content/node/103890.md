  combining diacritics</strong> and <b>Serbian versions of Cyrillic italics letters</strong>
  I've just checked how does <em>Brill</em> fare. Weirdly, it only fails to convert
  one letter properly, but what is weird is that even though the letters appear correctly
  in <em>Word</em>, they do not when one creates a PDF.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://s23.postimg.org/vsyn320ln/sshot_71.png\">\r\n\r\nWhy
  does it happen?\r\n\r\nThe only typefaces that manage to do these things correctly
  are two SIL ones, even ALPHABETUM, which seems to have the most complete set of
  characters, does not have the correct italics. "

  body: "Sylf, your question is a bit cryptic. I'll also be cryptic. There is in Brill
    Italic the substitution\r\n<PRE>\r\n    sub \\uni043D by \\uni043F.Serbian ;\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhere
    I would have expected <code>\\uni043F</code> on the left hand side. Here are the
    roman and the corresponding italic obtained with XeLaTeX.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brill_serb130613_6659.png]\r\n\r\nAdded
    later on (I guess it is now less cryptic). \r\nAlso XeLaTeX does not accept selecting
    the Serbian language for the font family Brill; after calling\r\n<code>\\setmainfont[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Serbian]{Brill}</code>\r\nXeLaTeX
    does not give the Serbian italic when using <code>\\textit</code>, probably because
    Serbian is not defined for the regular. I had to declare a separate font for the
    italic to get it above. I don't know if this is a XeLaTeX bug or not but Arno
    has Cyrillic/Serbian also for the roman, avoiding such a problem (and giving a
    different looking output for cyrillic small letter p and cyrillic small letter
    n).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arno_serb130616_3776.png]"

  body: "Sylph, I do not work with Serbian glyphs. But let me reference an older thread
    about PDFs made in Word 2010. The problem was that with Opentype Postscript flavor
    fonts, MS Word always converted to curves when going to PDF, regardless of the
    embeddability of the font.\r\nI do not know (but I would like to know) if this
    was fixed in Word 2013. I do not know what Word version you are using. I do not
    know if this is related to what you are seeing. Glad I could help!\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/72404\r\nRead

    a typeface issue and a Microsoft Word issue. The Word I'm using is from the Office
    2013. Which means that whatever the issue was, it isn't corrected.\r\n\r\nAs for
    Brill: why would a Cyrillic <em>n</em> in italics produce a correct Serbian cursive
    Cyrillic <em>p</em>?"

  body: "<blockquote>\r\nAs for Brill: why would a Cyrillic <em>n</em> in italics

    the Unicode character <code>043D</code> is \r\n<PRE>\r\n043D\tCYRILLIC SMALL LETTER
    EN\r\n</PRE>\r\nand the substitution rule in Brill as extracted above from the
    italic using FrontForge says to substitute uni043D, i.e. cyrillic small letter
    en, with uni043F.Serbian i.e. the Serbian variant of Unicode character 043F, namely
    \r\n<PRE>\r\n043F\tCYRILLIC SMALL LETTER PE\r\n</PRE>\r\nThat is how Unicode fonts
    work. The font contains substitution tables to apply for given scripts and languages.
    \r\n\r\nHow that particular substitution appeared that way in Brill is a bit mysterious
    to me."
