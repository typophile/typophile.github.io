  body: "The Type]Media Wiki is offline since a few months and will probably not return
    as such. It was hosted on a slow private server since 2002 and the Wiki software
    itself became outdated; it had very limited layout functionalities and became
    more and more vulnerable to spambots sadly.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process
    of creating a new Type]Media website which will be hosted on the KABK servers.
    I can\u2019t give any indications about when it will be finished, but as soon
    as there\u2019s more it will be posted here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nThere is some
    general information about the course at the KABK website though: http://www.kabk.nl/studierichtingen/vervolgopleidingen/inhoudstudie/type_media\r\nAnd
    you can visit us at the KABK Open Day on 26 January.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
