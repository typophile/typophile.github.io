  Can you guys tell me what you think? I thought the second image suited the name
  better.\r\n\r\nBTW - if you don't get the mark.. the books are having sexy time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adult-books-web_4478.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adult_Books_3992.jpg]"

  body: "Haha, thx p01ak. Never saw the same concept until now.\r\n\r\n@ riccardo
    - I was looking at the symbols as stick figures. Imagine the guy standing up with
    his stick piece going out and the woman on her hands.. etc The girl symbol could
    be facing the other direction as well. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions on improvements? "

  body: "hmmm. I'm unsure of this.\r\n\r\ncould be percieved as alienating toward
    gay and lesbian adults...who like books.\r\n\r\nI also think the execution could
    work better as campaign photography rather than a 'logo' as such.\r\n\r\nas an
    aside, \"Adult Books\" would never be able to be registered as a business name
    since they're both every day words. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPaul\r\n----------\r\n<a

  body: How about two vertical male books on opposite ends on a horizontal female
    book . . . high fivin' one another and another female book underneath in a 69
    position. Everybody wins.

  body: "LOL typodermic...sounds class\xE9.\r\n\r\nThanks Ratbaggy, I'll try that
    out.\r\n\r\nWell I guess the general consensus is that it the logo <em>can</em>
    work? It's for a fictional company so I can just say the store only sells straight
    adult books."

  body: That small rectangle in the upper middle is distracting. I assume it represents
    the back cover of the first book, but the prominent location -- in the middle
    of the logo with an arrow pointing towards it -- creates a distraction. I think
    they'd still be recognized as books without it.
