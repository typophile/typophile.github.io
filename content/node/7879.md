body: 'Is there a cure?  <BR>Signs of typophilia &#40;based on personal experience&#41;:
  <BR>When you read a book and can&#39;t enjoy it until you know what face&#40;s&#41;
  it is set in. When you can spend and hour weighing the merits of various interpretations
  of Caslon. When you wish you could use each of your thousands of fonts because,
  well, they are pretty. When you won&#39;t eat at a resturaunt because the menu is
  printed in Times and doesn&#39;t compliment the food. When you spend more time deciding
  what font to use for a paper than you spend deciding what to wear. When your occupation
  has nothing to do with typography but all the above is true, you have typophilia.
  <BR>What do you do to cope with this problem? If you&#39;d rather look at glyphs
  than go to a movie, something is wrong... if this illness can&#39;t be cured can
  it at least be managed?'
