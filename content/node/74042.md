body: "What are the best examples of text typesetting you've seen?\r\n\r\nWho makes
  them?\r\n\r\nI guess I'm asking because I consider myself a typesetter more than
  a designer. It seems as though I'm willing to put more faith (and time) into math
  than my designer friends, and more scrutiny into subtle, compound measurements that
  change the feel of a text. I think about texts from the textblock outward, rather
  than from the layout inward. I start a project by choosing a typeface, because most
  other decisions grow from that.\r\n\r\nAnd I am looking for some role models."

    Mountain</a> series of books -- an enjoyable combination of type, text, color,
    and illustrations.\r\nAn example of a designer with \"too much time on his hands\"
    ;-). It seems every single page has been thought about.\r\n\r\nI'd love to have
    a hard bound version, printed on a heavy bright white stock."

  body: Your link ended in ".ne" instead of ".net", so I had to Google. But the fact
    that these books are a free downloadable physics textbook - in addition to being
    beautiful - gladdens my heart, as it is a contribution to global education. Well,
    at least where the English language is spoken, which, admittedly, is where the
    need is least.

  body: "Now how did I do that...? Correction: <a href=\"http://www.motionmountain.net/\">http://www.motionmountain.net/</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also prejudiced to like the text: apart from being colorful, large (A4!), and
    generally very nicely designed, I'm very attracted to physics (physically, I guess)
    \ and at the very least able to understand  what all the fuzz is about :-)"

    the second year of the 29th Olympiad. 2009 AD is the first year of the 697th Olympiad.
    What he actually means is the second year of the 29th Olympiad <em>of the modern

    thoughts about the format, too.
