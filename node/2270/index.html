  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, first posting here, can anyone suggest a book that will teach me the anatomy of letterforms and type design. I'm a graphic designer of about 10 years standing but have never designed my own face. I did Fine Art at college rather than Graphics and a friend was telling me that on his graphics course they redrew Gill Sans and learnt the intricasies of each letter shape, that's the level of detail I'd like. I'm looking for something very hands on, telling me why different letters are particular widths, relationships between shapes etc. not anything theoretical, historical or overview. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any suggestions? Many thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Edwin, just be aware of the difference between making &quot;calligraphic&quot; (more properly called &quot;chirographic&quot;) type (like Zapf or Majoor*) versus making &quot;synthetic&quot; (Bilak's term) type (like Carter or Licko). You might end up favoring the former, but I'd recommend the latter.

		<div class="commentbody">Chirographic type is type that is somehow influenced (usually by structure, but sometimes also of finish - think Ex Ponto) by the arm/hand/broadnib_pen system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know of any resource (online or otherwise) that explains the opposition between chirographic and synthetic type. Peter Bilak's Fedra specimen has some stuff. There are resources that elaborate on chirography, but they generally avoid an analytical treatment of the functionality of typography (with good reason). When you pin down a chirographer, he ends up invoking WRBWWRM as an escape clause for functionality. Which is hilarious because chirographers disdain the Emigre/PoMo school. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is the distinction significant? Is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> significant? To most of the world, not a bit, so certainly chirography shmirography isn't going to affect the world very much. But we do have to focus on the context of this way in which we've chosen to spend our time, and if we mean to help type progress (instead of vegetate, or even regress), then the distinction is central. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which way of type design is &quot;easier&quot;? That's a very rich question. It depends on what kind of person you are. If you feel that control over you own creative process is the primary concern, then chirography is very attractive: it lays downs easy rules that you can follow cheerfully. But if you a) are worried more about the readability at the user's end, and b) are willing to realize that total control is illusional anyway, then chirography is nothing but an artificial limitation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In synthetic type, the rules you need to build (in order to make &quot;good design&quot; easier) start form elsewhere. So I would say that chirographic type is easier if you master its rules, while synthetic type is easier if you just don't bother so much with rules (PoMo). In that pairing the former is certainly better. But chirographic type is never very hard, while synthetic type can be surreally hard (by accounting for the true nature of reading), and that's the &quot;real stuff&quot; as far as I'm concerned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me try to give a concrete example: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In chirography, the bowls of the &quot;b/d/p/q&quot; generally have to be the same way (not identical, I mean structured the same way). In synthetic type, they don't - and this creates a problem: what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they need to be? How to avoid arbitrary results? The answer is: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Don't have such a phobia of arbitrariness - the control you have is proportional to the control you relinquish. This can be psychologically very hard. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Work backwards from the process of reading. This is technically very hard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can see why chirography is so popular: it strokes your ego, and it reduces your analytical load. You can be a free, happy artist, in your own little world of rules. Selfish. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. Thanks Hrant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I understand you correctly, your preference for synthetic types is based on a rejection of what you perceive to be arbitrary rules derived from the characteristics of now-outmoded (in the context of lengthy, mass-produced texts) technologies in favor of new rules derived solely from the function of the type.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is that a reasonable summary? If so, what about limitations imposed by current technology? Are they to be dealt with on a type-by-type basis depending on the intended use of a given design? Or, insofar as most all designs nowadays are executed with beziers drawn on a computer, are there more general rules for legibility/readability that are a necessary consequence of that process? As well, are other old technologies still exerting undue influence on type design (punchcutting, hot metal, phototypesetting, etc.)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">How much should the pen influence digital letter forms in text type? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Letterletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Gerrit Noordzij is on the side of strong pen influence. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Counterpunch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Fred Smeijers argues that though the starting point was calligraphy, even old style serifs are to a significant extent constructed, not pen drawn. Hrant, as you see, is militantly opposed to the influence of the pen.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, and I am much less knowledgeable than any of the above three, Smeijers' view rings true. On one hand, it is very hard to draw a good looking two story a or g that doesn't show the influence of the pen. And when you do an upper case M, if you don't let your weights be influenced by the broad-nibbed pen, the result tends to look unbalanced. On the other hand, Smeijers makes the case effectively that the look of Garamond and even Jenson are decisively influenced by construction of the punch, not the pen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also an important point is what Eric Spiekerman said: that text faces can only vary about 5% and still be readable and good. To me this means that you can be too pen influenced or get too far from the pen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So to me the dichotomy that Hrant is setting up is misleading. It is rather that there is a sliding scale between pen-written and mechanical, and most successful faces, and probably all successful text faces, are somewhere in the middle range.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In display faces you can get away with very pen drawn scripts or very mechanical sans.</div>

And after all the end test is the person reading, which hasn't changed. And some of the scribes were, very, very good.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second thing is that I don't see much change in readibility over thousands of years. If you look at a page of the Torah scroll, which has looked the same for probably 2,500 years or so - since they switch to the pen drawn Aramaic script - it is pretty much just as readable as anything today.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The third thing is that changes from the early model of Garamond haven't improved readability, but if anything reduced it. One change with the 'modern' styles of Bodoni etc. which are less readable in text. Another change has been the sans serifs that proliferated in the 20th century; again not a gain but a loss in text.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A fourth thing is that you have different alphabets, and Chinese characters and I haven't ever heard that is makes a radical difference in the rate you can read with comprehension. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The basic thing with all of these written language systems is that they are systems of lines in closed or open forms with branches. The brain seems to get used to dealing with one, and is very, very good at decoding.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All this makes me think we are near some limit on what the brain can do, and the problem isn't shaping the alphabet a little differently. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I think we can do is understand better what makes for comfortable reading, and for reading with less strain. Also at the limits perhaps some innovations can really help. These are such things as very small type, signs at night, low res. screens, etc.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am interested in improving readibility, but all these things make me think we are talking about small improvments. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;2) What is &quot;greatly&quot;?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I would be very surprised if you could increase reading speed with the same comprehension by more than 5% by any improvments in type design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any improvement is great, and there are also aesthetic considerations, which are very important as well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is something beautiful and magical in letters.

BTW, the punchcutters used modularity too (through the use of counterpunches). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Modularity is its own thing (that needs to be controlled). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you must learn how to fix the problems <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it's the same for chirography!

I use a pencil myself, but only because computer software simpy isn't good enough yet - or you could say I'm not good enough to use it to good effect, since some of the most accomplished designers (like Carter) work directly on the computer.

Use what you have. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I continue to point to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this resource<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which shows the modern cap proportions based on the H and E. Also, drawn in a black bodoni for the purposes mentioned. Other tasty tidbits on the chart: decending R foot, cleavage on the R and B, the X ordeal, how to do the thick diagonal on an N, how to do the apex on an A, V+V vs W. Enjoy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as the bodoni tracing, maybe don't even trace it. Try to recreate the letters in the chart above using the broad pen. Do the thicks in one thick stroke, the thins in one thin stroke. Dont worry about pretty letters.
