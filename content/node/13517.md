body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Frutiger</strong>\r\n\r\nThis typeface
  was designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]] and was commissioned by the Charles De Gaulle
  International Airport in Paris for usage on directional signage. Frutiger is a [[humanist]]
  [[sans serif|sans-serif]], and has become one of Adrian Frutiger\u2019s best-known
  typefaces, along with [[Univers]]. The weight of the forms are much less monotone
  than Univers, and due to these subtle thicks and thins the typeface has far more
  character. Since the 1980s, the fonts have been available in digital form from [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nFrutiger
  has been an extreme success, and in 2003 it has been revised ([[ASTRA-Frutiger]])
  for use on highway signage in Switzerland. In addition, the typeface was revised
  and updated in 1999 by Adrian Frutiger himself (together with [[Linotype]]) to include
  true italics among other features; this typeface is called [[Frutiger Next]].\r\n\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype</a> website has overview pages showing
  all the weights of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/469/frutiger-family.html\">Frutiger
  type family</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html\">Frutiger
  Next</a>."
