  body: "After searching with the Serif Font ID Guide, I think this is a modification
    of the late Bob Alonso's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/shangrala/?refby=bowfin\">Shangrala</a>.
    The letters have been widened/flattened and the serifs have been modified with
    triangles, but the underlying font seems extremely close (see especially the A,
    which was not modified much). The serifs in this sample look like they have been
    pasted on to me.\r\n\r\nAt least, if I was re-creating this, this would be a good
    starting point.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It is in fact Amerigo with horizontal scaling. I found a match after about
    45 minutes of searching through my font library. \r\n\r\nThanks for the assistance

  body: "I can see now why the Serif  Guide missed Amerigo, which Kent recognized.
    The E foot serif for Amerigo was classed as angled and I searched for vertical.
    It could arguably be described both ways, so I need to fix the coding for that
    one to allow both choices.  I also think that the Alonso font has similar proportions
    and structural forms (at least for those 3 letters), and that is why the Guide
    included it in the possible matches, based on the E, M and R key letters.\r\n\r\n-
