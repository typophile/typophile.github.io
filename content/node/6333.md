  <BR> <BR>Aside from feasting on John Kerry&#39;s bones, it&#39;s recipes from those
  partial to Lincoln and Reagan and macaroni and cheese. Like John McCain&#39;s Mean
  Beans, Gov. Pataki&#39;s Empire Apple Muffins, Rush&#39;s [Limbaugh] Mom&#39;s Fluffy
  Potato Casserole, Pat Buchanan&#39;s Buffalo Right Wings, Bob Dole&#39;s Kansas
  Whole Wheat Honey Bread, which he presumably bakes those spare moments he isn&#39;t

    let it Trickle Down your cheek and the side of your face will be well supplied.  Eventually,
    it will drip off your supplied side and, if you are not taxed too much, you will
    have fed the hungry.'
