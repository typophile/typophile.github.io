body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI take a part in a project developing Armenian alphabet for
  existing latin/multilingaul font family in order to expand its multilingual set.
  So I\u2019m interested in the proportions of Armenian letters, especially comparing
  with Latin ones. I\u2019ve learned just a couple of basics about the smaller x-height
  of armenian typefaces for the better readability. It\u2019s not enough for a quality
  authentic font. I\u2019ve got a copy of  Mnatsakanyans \u201CHaykakan Taratesakner\u201D
  (1972), and another one from Gortsakalyan (1973). But the content of these books
  is considered to be \u201Clatinized\u201D, doesn\u2019t it? Could you recommend
  me any other literature about Armenian type design?  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\ntat"

  body: "I just found this thread (thanks to your Elien\r\none) so I don't know if
    it still matters, but:\r\n\r\nMost of the work of Mnatsakanyan and others (certainly
    the crushing majority of digital Armenian fonts) are indeed highly Latinized,
    especially in the lowercase. I myself have worked a lot in the direction of aesthetic
    and functional authenticity of Armenian, and one quick thing I can refer you to
    is this: http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html\r\n\r\nIf you'd like more please
    let me know.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
