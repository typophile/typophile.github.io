body: "Ever wondered what it looks like inside one of the large type foundries? You
  might be surprised by how it looks, but then again, you probably shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I first saw Linotype a year ago I was rather shocked at the offices... Anyway, earlier
  this month the company moved to a new building (should update your address book
  before your next visit). This new place is quite different: ultra modern, full of
  glass walls, robotic blinds and lights, and excellent coffee.\r\n\r\nFor this occasion
  of relocating, I posted a few images of the old and new buildings. There are also
  pictures from inside the fabled Linotype archives and some (soon to be posted) pics
  of the interesting pieces of history which were thrown out during the move!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/showcase/

  body: "Well, that's an improvement.\r\n\r\nMy two favourite memories of the old
    offices (which were in part of a Dupont Chemical building):\r\n\r\nDigging through
    the non-Latin collection in the basement -- before it went to Reading -- while
    Dupont guys in hazmat suits wandered past the door.\r\n\r\nEating kangaroo meat
    in the cafeteria during the mad cow disease scare."

  body: "There were many jokes and theories about the old building and what was actually
    going on there. After Sept. 11 there was a huge increase in security... But now
    Du Pont is moving to a new building anyway\u2014so there is just the lonely Du-Pont-Stra\xDFe
    by itself.\r\n\r\nAs for the food, in my 11 months there it seemed to go quite
    down hill. Something went on with changing the cooking staff mid-year, then maybe
    the just gave up because they knew they were closing? I don't eat meat, but by
    the end it appeared to be something more like rat or pigeon being served. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
