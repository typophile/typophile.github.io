body: "Hey there\r\n\r\nMaybe you can help me out - I am looking for a font which
  has similarities with Rotis or Gill. But I don't wanna use either of those two -
  Gill is (in my opinion) to common and Rotis is not exactly what I'm looking for
  either. It must be a Sans-Serif and it should have a Gill style minuscule \"d\"
  (no extension) and a minuscule Rotis \"u\" (no extension either)... I'm not talking
  \"Futura\" or \"Kabel\" - they reflect a certain zeitgeist way to much - the font
  I'm looking for shouldn't fit into a certain era - it should be timeless. In my
  opinion they (Futura & Kabel) are to playful as well for my task. It should be a
  warm, friendly, trustworthy Sans-Serif - a mixture of Gill and Rotis. I know my
  request is very specific, could you help me out?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot guys!!!\r\n\r\n-jan"

    \u2026 but maybe you want to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dax/\">Dax</a>?\r\n\r\n<cite>it
    should be timeless</cite>\r\nWell, that\u2019s difficult indeed, and a matter
    of taste, imho. Every typeface is, to some extent, a child of its time."

    Reichel just like FF Dax and it seems to be a predecessor of FF Sari."
