  Sans Extra Condensed Bold font but even more bolder?\r\nSo I would like it to keep
  the condensed feature(tall) and also the short tails and tops(e.g. d,b,h,g,y,etc)
  and also the line stroke to be as even as possible but I would like it to be more
  bolder.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    \"tails and tops\" are descenders and ascenders, but I like your terms too!"
