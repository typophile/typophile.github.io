  clothing line, Dereon.\r\n\r\nI have attached a picture of the logo below.\r\n\r\nI
  believe parts of the letters have been altered. I have a tattoo on my arm using
  this font and I forgot the name of the font since it has been a long time since
  I got the tattoo.\r\n\r\nHelp would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nJaeSays"
