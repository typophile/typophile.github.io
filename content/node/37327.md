  body: "Overall, I think it looks excellent. Concise, to the point and refreshingly
    original. One thing that I  picked out was the 'papers of interest' section. Are
    these titles of papers which you have written, or titles of a publication? It
    would be a good idea to reference them (year written, name of publisher etc...).\r\n\r\nApart
    from that, bravo. Good luck with the job search (I'd invite you for an interview).\r\n\r\nMike"

    make that subheading \u2013 subjects of interest \u2013 to save confusion. "

    Is that an aussie term? Here we'd say REFERENCES instead.\r\n\r\nI like the look
    a lot. Once you have more experience I'd take out some of the padding - I was
    never impressed by Career Statements, or Objectives on a resume. I also think
    you could combine Design Skills and Software."

  body: "Prolly the best way I can help is to edit some of the content:\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    \"Career statement\" isn't quite the right header. Maybe \"Profile\" would be
    better? I don't think what that section says is concise enough to call a statement.\r\n\r\n\"I
    researched into branding\" -- What you want to say is \"I researched branding\".\r\n\r\n\"Whilst
    at university\" -- \"While at university\" is fine. \"Whilst\" sounds very old.\r\n\r\n\"Identities
    by of design\" -- not sure, but you need to pick one. \"by of\" doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\"Referees\"
    -- you mean \"references\" But I wouldn't bother including a section for references
    just to say they are supplied upon request. No need to have it. If they want references,
    they'll ask.\r\n\r\nUnder \"Design Skills\"  --  you might want to use caps or
    small caps on Branding and visual ID. Otherwise id reads as a word.\r\n\r\nUnder
    \"Freelance Jobs\" -- \"Designed of event logo\" ... you mean either \"designed
    event logo\" or \"design of event logo\". Also, these are not complete sentences.
    Don't put a period after the bulletted points. And they should be parallel in
    structure -- so use either a verb or noun construction for each one.\r\n\r\nI
    can't find your name. I see that it's in your email address, but I think it should
    be big enough that it hits the reader immediately. Your names is important.\r\n\r\n\r\nK."

    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whilst at University I have also gained experience in helping
    a number of local businesses with their visual identities by designing logos,
    poster and other basic graphic design. This has allowed me to use my range of
    skills in graphic design and typography.\"\r\n\r\nI'm no english professor, but
    perhaps you could consider these alterations:\r\n\r\n\"Whilst\" is best changed
    to \"while.\"\r\n\r\nGet rid of the have/has. For example, \"While at University,
    I also gained experience...\"\r\n\r\n\"logos, poster, and other basic graphic
    design\" is not parallel, and needs to be. You can do this by making poster plural.
    \ I'm a bit confused as to what to do with \"basic graphic design,\" however.
    \ It shouldn't be listed, anyway, because without the other parts of the sentence,
    it would read \"by designing basic graphic design.\" \r\n\r\nIt's good to add
    some some sort of reference after \"this\" so that the reader knows what you're
    referring to. What is it that has allowed you to use your range of skills in graphic
    design and typography?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope I've helped a little!"

    like coming across the word font in a British book -- it's spelled \"fount\" but
