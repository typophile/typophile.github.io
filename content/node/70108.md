  university I attend. As part of my duties, I'm in charge of all the organisation's
  graphic design. Because my uni is in southern Louisiana, someone years ago decided
  that the logo has to incorporate a prawn, but the old logo was in my opinion not
  really recognisable as anything. This is old logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant_3984.png]\r\nAnd
  this is one I am working on:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apres_5807.png]\r\nI
  tried to make it more apparent what it was supposed to be and also make it look
  less Looney-Tunes-esque. Any criticism anyone could give would be appreciated. I'm
  not a graphic designer, but the responsiblity falls to me, so I'm doing my best."

  body: "Can you tell us a little about the student organisation in question? What's
    it's purpose? This really helps define the insignia as well as the typeface you
    use.\r\n\r\nMy main concern with your revised version is that it's, errr, wiggly.
    The image certainly says \"prawn\" to me far more than the previous version. However,
    by nature prawns aren't good at being self-contained.\r\n\r\nI keep seeing possibilities
    with circles on this one. You may try bounding the prawn via curling it up in
    a more circular shape, or creating a boundary (i.e. thin-lined circle) that the
    prawn's feelers break.\r\n\r\nChallenging assignment, good luck!\r\n"

    don't always have to show the entire object. Sometimes it's more interesting to
    show a small representation of the rest of the object. "

    revision looks a bit awkward, but I tried to give a more unified appearance."

  body: I think the prawn is too bold and blocky compared to the RHA... perhaps it
    might be good to make it a little thinner and smaller!

    The revisions that you are presenting us look like clip art... \r\nBut if you
    still feel the need to redesign, maybe you should work more in the typography."

    thought the old logo was ugly, but the general consensus seems to be that my version
    is worse than the original, so I guess I'll just leave things the way they were."

  body: "Consider a less drastic change. If you want to update the logo, by all means.\r\n\r\nTry
    simplifying the components of the prawn, and maybe giving the type more attention
    (but don't use the type you were using on your other attempt, it's not as strong.)
    Toy around with that and see what happens."

  body: In all these examples, the prawn dwarfs the type. Try making the prawn subordinate
    to the type and focus on choosing the proper typeface.
