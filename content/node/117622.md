  as it is a copy of embroidery thread off a old paper & in yellow. \r\nWell I am
  able to see that it is similar somewhat to Calibri & Arial but not 100% accurate.
  \r\nWith the help of you people,  I hope that I will find the font. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in anticipation; \r\nHasnain Munawar\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joe_5214.jpg]"
