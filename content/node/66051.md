  tried with all kinds of classic fonts but we can't seem to find one that works.
  The word should be in UC, so the capitals matters a great deal. The word/logo is
  comprised of a lot of round and square shapes, which tend to make the word mark
  a little boring. The brand is not too premium, but not too low-priced either. In
  short, what we need is something with low contrast between stem and serifs, a little
  condensed, classic but modern in some way. More Baskerville than Didot. More Caecilia
  than Clarendon, but definitely something designed in the modern age.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"
