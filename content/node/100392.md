  font is complet with Nikud and Teamim.\r\nI am not a designer and I am better at

    I am getting at is that, Times-Roman and the many other variations of Times are
    well established commercial fonts, the most ubiquitous and well known versions
    of which are licensed by Monotype (Linotype) and Adobe. There are numerous versions
    knocking around which are advertised as freeware but are basically re-distributed
    without the permission of those foundries and developers that produced the digital
    files. My concern is that you have modified another font to add your characters
    to and it is not clear how the original file was licensed or what its origin is.
    This is problematic in a number of ways but it also means that advertising your
    version of the font as usable for commercial work is misleading, as without knowing
    the full heritage of the file and licensing, supported by a recognised or robust
    EULA, it would be difficult if not impossible for a commercial entity to take
    advantage of the font.\r\n\r\nYou could avoid these issues by placing your original
    character set inside a new font file and applying clean metadata with a clear
    license and/or usage guidelines. Considering that you would like your data to
    be available for commercial usage but with a clause prohibiting modification,
    you might consider the [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/|Creative
    Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-ND 3.0) license]]. While this
    license is not mindful of fonts specifically (though it is used in association
    with the [[http://fontstruct.com/faq/licensing_legal_questions/an_overview_of_licensing|fontstruct
    font creation tool]]), it is well established and covers your criteria."

  body: "I can't think of any fonts that would fit your requirement in terms of preventing
    further modification once you have added and performed your own modifications,
    i.e., if you use a font that is subject to an open source, copyleft or other libre
    license, such as the GNU GPL (with or without font exception) then all the work
    that you do and release should (in the spirit of the license) be subject to the
    same terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to consider releasing under
    one of the open source licenses, such as discussed in [[http://typophile.com/node/97575|the
    open source typefaces thread]] then you would probably find the [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/|Font
    Squirrel site]] to be the best single resource for finding something to match
    your needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it comes down to this, it is inherently unfair,
    in my opinion, to take something designed by someone else, modify it and then
    ask that other people respect your wishes in <em>not</em> doing what you have
    done, particularly if you have no agreement with the originator of that data/design.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the perspective of your design, I would suggest that you consider releasing a
    clean font with just the characters created by you to support Hebrew. It would
    not be the first time that I have seen such a font with no Latin support, and
    with the design and data being yours from a legal and ethical perspective (though
    that is open to debate as well) you could place whatever restrictions or lack
    thereof on the font."

    he made himself (as opposed to the Latin component) but the bundled third-party
    open-source component is getting him stuck.\r\n\r\nBesides the good suggestion
    of unbundling the Latin from the Hebrew, I can think of one other avenue: find
    a Latin font that's free but disallows modification, and convince its designer
    to let you add your Hebrew to it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    if you find a good fit/match stylistically it would certainly be to the advantage

    who make Armenian fonts and give them away* have rarely spent the time learning
    to do it right (just like in Latin, actually).\r\n\r\n* Notable here is that few
