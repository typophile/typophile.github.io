body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\nHope you've all been good. \r\n\r\nI'm giving final touches
  to a new Latin typeface which has also a soft/rounded version. I was slightly confused
  whether I should call it  Rounded or Soft? Any suggestions? \r\n\r\nHere is how
  it looks:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quantum01_6389.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quantum02_4939.png]\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: I would not refer to it as "soft"; that's only good for selling toilet paper
    or bath towels.

  body: depending on intended use, <em>social</em> might be an option nowadays, instead
    of rounded

  body: "I call my FF Unit Rounded, because it is. That word is a participle, meaning
    something straight has been rounded. Nothing about the amount of rounding. There
    are typefaces called Round, implying that they do have complete semicircles for
    terminals. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unitrounded_5433.png]"

  body: True, on rethinking it my expectation of semicircular terminals is too narrow
    for the word "rounded." But at the same time I see Unit's curves as corners made
    into "quarter rounds," that is as arcs of a circle and thus also the same kind
    of "rounded" animal as a font with semicircular terminals. Satya's typeface to
    my eye is a different thing--more inflated than router-carved.
