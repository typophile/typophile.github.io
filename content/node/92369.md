body: "Hi, guys,\r\n\r\nI am looking for some critique on this project. It started
  as a sketch of the uppercase characters & developed into lowercase. I am wondering
  whether to introduce some weight to this project as the negative space in some of
  the lowercase glyphs contrasts a lot with the uppercase. \r\n\r\nDoes the x height
  of the lowercase fit the cap height ok? I looked at Gotham Condensed Bold for some
  guidelines on vertical proportion. \r\n\r\nWould appreciate any feedback from you
  experts out there.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHarrycb\r\n\r\n"

    house... The classic example here is Futura: the circles look like circles because
    they're not circles. :-)  So unless you want the \"naive\" look you'll need to
    carry out extensive modulation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: Thanks for your feedback. So I should loose the geometry of the strokes?
      Could you recommend any fonts to look at, other than Futura? Thanks
