  can't find any on MyFonts or through Google.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of Monticello but
  I understand that's more of a derivative (like Sabon is to Garamond) than a direct
  adaptation."

  body: "When comparing printing from digital fonts to printing from metal fonts,
    I'm not quite sure what wouldn't be \"derivative.\" \r\n\r\nThe papers are different,
    the inks are different, as is the method of applying the ink. The individual characters
    are different, too. Each character in metal is cast -- each \"e\", for example
    -- and has it's own blemishes -- or uniqueness, depending on how you view such
    things.\r\n\r\nThe positioning of the letters in metal can vary as well -- in
    three dimensions, though oddly enough, \"width\" is usually quite well controlled.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, getting the ink to form the same with metal/letterpress as with digital/offset
    is a challenge few are willing to undertake, or have the skill to achieve. I think
    Carter did rather well, his digital Monticello is a bit better than the Linotype
    202 (photocomp) Monticello.\r\n\r\nIs this what you had in mind? Or did you mean
    the Linotype (linecaster) Monticello differs from the ATF Oxford.\r\n\r\nFrom
    another source:\r\n http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-33550.html\r\n\r\n<cite>Linotype
    Monticello was designed by Griffith in 1946. Its design is based on James Ronaldson's
    Roman No.1 and Oxford Typefaces from American Type Founders and was revised by
    Matthew Carter while he was working at Linotype between 1965-1981. Mac McGrew:
    Monticello is a Linotype recreation of America's first great typeface, Binny&Ronaldson's
    Roman No.1, cut about 1796 by Archibald Binny in Philadelphia.</cite>\r\n\r\n.
    . . \r\n\r\n<cite>C. H. Griffith, Linotype typographic consultant, made a detailed
    study of Binny's type and redrew it in 1946 for the requirements of Linotype composition
    and modern printing conditions.</cite>\r\n\r\nEven though the linecaster & its
    duplexed mats required differences from foundry type, to the extent possible,
    Griffith went ahead & allowed as many of the complications as possible -- the
    full-formed italic j, f, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say it is an adaptation, not derivative.\r\n\r\n&
    I believe Matthew further removed some of the linecaster compromises when he did
    the PostScript version of Monticello, though I'm working from memory, & might
    have that wrong...\r\n\r\nBTW, & Updike notwithstanding, Binny & Ronaldson's fonts
    are usually considered a, what, \"not-the-best-quality\" ripoff of  fonts from
    the U.K. \r\n"

    the samples of Linotype Monticello look rather different to my eyes, although
    I suppose the output from a line caster would look different from that of a hand
    press for other reasons besides the type itself.\r\n\r\nI'd assumed the digital
    Monticello was closer to the machine Monticello than to Oxford; it's rather hard
    to tell just by looking at images on MyFonts.  If I'm wrong then so be it.  :)"

  body: "<blockquote><em>Rather than simply copying the original, Griffith took into
    consideration such factors as the heavy appearance of its lowercase ... [he] had
    to thicken the capitals slightly...</em></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn this, Lawson is
    incorrect. He either misinterpreted or misunderstood his sources.\r\n\r\nThe case
    was in fact the opposite. Griffith chose to reduce the weight of the capitals
    slightly in order to get a more appropriate balance under contemporary press circumstances.
    \r\n\r\nAs Griffith explained in an article in <em>Linotype News</em> in 1951:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CBefore
    the Monticello project assumed tangible form, Fred Anthoensen of Portland, Maine,
    provided specimen pages set in Oxford type and printed on a variety of papers
    commonly used in commercial and book printing. These specimen pages provided the
    means for an analytical study of the contemporary behavior of the type in comparison
    with its action in the medium for which is was originally designed. It\u2019s
    finer qualities [ . . . ] failed to materialize to the last degree when impressed
    on modern papers. On relatively smooth stock the capitals were as weighty and
    obtrusive as Scotch, an effect quite contrary to Binny\u2019s intent. This, and
    other inconsistencies, made it clearly evident that Binny\u2019s type could not
    be satisfactorily uprooted and transplanted for contemporary printing by a weight-for-weight
    and curve-for-curve copy of the original.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nReferencing
    some of the same material I just quoted, as well as drawing from correspondence,
    Creesy describes the situation more explicitly in his 2006 <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/Monticello/\">article</a>
    from <em>Printing History</em> (which was linked in that other thread referred
    to above):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CGriffith was particularly concerned about
    the relative weight of the capitals and lower-case letters. He had been comparing
    his favorite historical example of Pica No. 1, Marshall's <em>Life of Washington</em>,
    with samples of Oxford set for him by Fred Anthoensen, whose Anthoensen Press
    in Portland, Maine [ . . . ] His theory was that Binny had to thicken the capitals
    because otherwise, under the conditions of early 19th-century printing \u2013
    using damp rag paper, ink balls, and heavy impression under soft packing \u2013
    they would look too light relative to the denser lower-case letters. But when
    the very same type, represented by Oxford, was printed with a modern letterpress
    \u2013 using smoother papers, precision form rollers, hard packing, etc. \u2013
    the capitals looked too dark. Consequently, he thought he would have to restrain
    the capitals \"just a shade\" to get the desired balance.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    encourage you to read Creesy\u2019s entire article."
