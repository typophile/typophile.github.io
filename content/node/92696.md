  looking for a font similar to the \"Alien\". Free would be preferable, though if
  it's really good I might be willing to pay some. I've found a couple on dafont.com
  that aren't too bad, but they're a little more..... whimsical than I want. I'm looking
  for something kind of edgy. Thanks."

  body: Search for halloween fonts at Dafont, at Fontspace, and with Bing, Yahoo,
    or Google. I think that "Face Your Fears" may be close to what you're looking
    for.

    can manage by making the size bigger on certain letters.\r\n\r\nStill gonna do
    some more hunting to see if I can find something a little closer to what I want."

  body: That one may actually work if I type up what I want and then use the pen tool
    to trace and clean up the edges a bit so it doesn't look as much like a brush
    stroke. Thanks.
