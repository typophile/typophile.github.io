    opening titles (names, etc)?\r\n\r\nIt's a really great movie, by the way, I loved
    it.  And they shot parts of it a couple of blocks from me in downtown LA!"

    but better than most movies that I watched in a couple of months.\r\n\r\nTarantino
    makes some pretty darn good movies, though, for a Hollywood director."

  body: To answer my own question, I'm pretty sure they used Mrs Eaves throughout
    the movie. That nice uc R made the connection.
