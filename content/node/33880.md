body: "Who owns the \"Linotype\" design rights (Geschmacksmusterrechte)?\r\n\r\nIn
  August 2006, nearly one year ago, Monotype Imaging Inc. is said to have acquired
  the Linotype GmbH from its German owner, the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG.\r\n\r\nBut
  apparently, Monotype only acquired Linotype as a naked company shell without the
  design rights (Geschmacksmusterrechte).\r\n\r\nIf Monotype had acquired the design
  rights too, then today, one year later, Monotype would be registered as owner of
  the design rights at the German and European design offices.\r\n\r\nBut this is
  not the case. I checked dozens of entries at the design offices and discovered that
  the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG is still the owner of the design rights.\r\n\r\nExample:
  Who owns the design rights to \"Zapfino\"?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Neither Linotype GmbH
  nor Monotype Imaging Inc. own the design rights to \"Zapfino\", because the design
  rights are still owned by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG.\r\n\r\nThe registration
  documents for \"Zapfino\" are difficult to locate. Therefore, for the convenience
  of readers, I scanned some of the public documents as evidence:\r\n\r\nFor the entries
  of the German design office see:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf1.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf1a.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf1b.gif\r\n\r\nFor
  the entries of the European design office see:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf2.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf2a.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/zapf2b.gif\r\n\r\nNote
  that file zapf2.pdf was \"last updated on: 15/05/2007\".\r\n\r\nNote that above
  temporary files will be deleted in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe design office registrations
  are public evidence and cannot be refuted by Linotype or Monotype as \"false\" registrations.
  This has the following legal consequence:\r\n\r\nIf, for example, Linotype sells
  you a \"license\" to \"Zapfino\", you do not obtain a license to \"Zapfino\", because
  neither Linotype nor Monotype own the design rights to \"Zapfino\" and hence cannot
  sell any licenses to these design rights.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for other \"Linotype\"
  fonts. By generalisation we can say:\r\n\r\nWho buys fonts at Linotype, gets nothing,
  because Linotype owns nothing.\r\n"
