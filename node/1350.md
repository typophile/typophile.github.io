  York Times has a feature on the redesign of Franklin Gothic for MoMA by Matthew
  Carter. The print edition features an overlayed image of the two typefaces and a
  picture of Carter in his studio. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/arts/design/21BLUM.html"

  body: It appears to me that the NYT is taking a quote about the typeface Franklin
    Gothic No. 2 out of context and applying it to the MoMA logotype, making a highly
    lauded and respected designer look like an &#149;&#149;&#149;. On top of that,
    they then make Carter&#39;s job look pointless. <BR> <BR>The author, Andrew Blum,
    decided to be glib and ignorantly dismissive. And the article reflects that.

  body: The problem with the question as posed by the NY  <BR>Times caption, and with
    the subsequent perseverating  <BR>over the two logos, is that Carter wasn&#39;t
    hired to  <BR>redraw the MoMA &#42;logotype&#42; -- he was hired to create  <BR>a
    revised cut of Franklin Gothic &#40;two of them, in fact,  <BR>text and display&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Any comparison of four letters -- well three, actually --  <BR>especially
    these particular few, will inevitably show  <BR>little perceptible difference.
    The real differences, I  <BR>suspect &#40;and justification for the project&#41;
    will only be  <BR>seen when the fonts are used in mass. Then the  <BR>cumulative
    effect of refined letterforms and spacing may  <BR>show up in a difference in
    overall fit and color --  <BR>moderate passages of text in a catalog or brochure,  <BR>large
    display signage, etc. <BR> <BR>A logo alone is bound to be an inadequate demonstration,  <BR>IMHO.

  body: Hrant. In an attempt to answer your second question -- And I&#39;ll probably
    sound as if I&#39;m waffling -- I think that perhaps they chose Franklin Gothic
    as an understated &#40;yet bold&#41; way of representing a museum which has some
    of the boldest and most colorful art in New York. Or maybe just plain old -- it
    holds color. Why dress up the museum too much? This said, I also like what The
    Walker in Minn. did with Matthew&#39;s type. So that is where I&#39;m waffling.
    But, MoMA need not be that way. Why compare them to anyone?

    2? It&#39;s very slightly condensed, and the dots of the i and j are a little

  body: I would not infer anything about the kerning or spacing  <BR>of Carter&#39;s

    old logo  <BR>looks unevenly spaced in the MoM, while Carter&#39;s looks  <BR>fine
    to my eye. <BR> <BR>I would expect that in a heavy sans serif like this the M  <BR>and
    the o would quite likely have symmetrical sidebearings.  <BR>Probably no kerning
    necessary. <BR> <BR>Georgia does not have kerning, presumably, because  <BR>kerning
    has little meaning for screen display, and  <BR>probably because MS didn&#39;t
