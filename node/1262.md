  unusual and fresh and I would like to protect it from being stolen before official
  release. Initially I wanted to get some feedback from you guys during it creation
  but I am afraid to publish the sketch on the net. <BR> <BR>How can I protect my
  design? '

    persons though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>One solution might be to show it to a smaller number of persons &#40;by
    email or whatever&#41;, minimizing the risk of it getting out. '

    someone stole your design from  <BR>these forums, you&#39;d have a few thousand
    witnesses  <BR>and dates of postings to back you up. &#40;That&#39;s not  <BR>to
    say we have resources beyond our sheer good  <BR>will to help anyone litigate.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Consider the critique as a way to stake your  <BR>claim. '

    an &#34;established&#34; designer &#40;whatever that means&#41;, it&#39;s worth
