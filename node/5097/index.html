  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So after a long delay, I've finally compiled something that I feel could really help type designers: a list of the most frequent letter-pairs according to actual language, so that designers can better figure out what pairs need kerning. The following list is for English, and it's derived from the venerable Brown corpus (by Kucera &amp; Francis). It's not a huge corpus by today's standards (&quot;only&quot; about a million words), but it's nicely generic (not limited to Shakespear, newspapers, or the Bible like some other corpora) and there's been a lot of derivative research based on it - which is in fact what actually allowed me to do this, since I don't yet have the Brown corpus as a digital file; I compiled the files from a linguistic analysis book by Dominic Massaro, where all pairs in all 3-7 letter words from the Brown corpus were quantified (in fact in all word positions). For the 2-letter words I went through the Brown corpus myself: there were about 25 of them - although they account for ~20% of English text! <BR> <BR>The list is broken up into three frequency groups. The cutoffs are pretty arbitrary, but what I tried to do is group them such that there's a triple difference: group 2 is three times the size of group 1, and group 3 is triple group 2. In this way a designer can decide how &quot;deep&quot; he wants to go. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/kf_pairs.rtf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/kf_pairs.rtf">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/kf_pairs.rtf</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Few fonts are used exclusively for one language, and it difficult to make predictions beyond one orthography to anticipate what kerning pairs might be important for other languages. So 'linguistic kerning' is of limited value unless you have a pressing technical need to significantly limit the number of kerning pairs in a font. Letter pair frequency analysis should be seen as a good mechanism for filtering and reducing kerning information, not for building it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's so flattering to have your constant &quot;special attention&quot;, John&hellip;  :-/ <BR> <BR>There are two reasons to make a kern for a letter pair: if it's very awkward (like &quot;AV&quot;); or if it's slightly awkward but very common (like &quot;st&quot;). Linguistic frequency data helps a lot for the latter*. Since any form of design is concerned with efficiency, kerning absolutely everything is basically wasteful (in at least two ways), and smart pair lists can only help**. Mana-16 has 1500+ pairs, but it still consiously avoids many hundreds more. <BR> <BR>* Similarly, minding the spacing of the most frequent 100 words in English -which cover 45% of typical text- makes your fonts better faster. So you can work on another font. <BR> <BR>** Part of the reason is that you simply can't kern &quot;Ta&quot; and &quot;T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, you misunderstood me &ndash; perhaps because you assume that I'm picking on you &ndash;: I was not saying that what you have done is not useful, I was pointing out that its usefulness might be different from how you characterised it. This sort of linguistic information is useful, but I think it is most useful for filtering kerning data. And this is <i>not</i> the same as building kerning data. <BR> <BR>Luc(as) de Groot has the most extensive set of linguistic kern data that I'm aware of, and he points out that this is the key to generating a manageable set of pairs that a) are really useful and improve text for the languages covered in a predictable way, and b) is small enough to work in all applications. The latter is the primary reason for wanting to filter kerning to the most frequent pairs. Many applications cannot support fonts with very large numbers of kern pairs (Tom Phinney recommends no more than 3,000 standard kern pairs in a font). So the usefulness of linguistic kerning data is linked to technical limitations in specific font formats and applications, and in addressing these limitations the kind of data that you have compiled <i>is useful</i>. <BR> <BR>Through making fonts for companies like MS, though, I've grown impatient with the process of making fonts to address software limitations or bugs. Many font developers are in an endless game of catch-up with software: always trailing in the wake of the latest versions, always trying to figure out what bugs exist or what parts of a given font format have been implemented and which have not. I try to avoid being in this situation, and design to the font specification and for software that is doing what it should, not what the app developers have bothered to do. This isn't always possible, of course: if a client specifically says 'I need this font to work in X application on Y operating system', then I need to do everything I can to make this possible, including linguistic filtering of kerning <i>if there is a significant limit on kern pair support in that application.</i> Again, this is why I see linguistic kerning as primarily a tool for filtering kerning data, not for developing it. <BR> <BR>There are a lot of languages in the world (probably somewhere between 4,500 and 6,200, depending on how you count dialects). Of these, a very large number are written in the Latin script, with more or fewer diacritics. Many of these languages use 'common' letters to represent different classes of phoneme, e.g. <i>w</i> is a vowel in Welsh, which significantly affects the kind of pair combinations in which it frequently occurs. The more of these languages one tries to support, the less useful letter-pair frequency information becomes, because the number of frequent pairs expands rapidly. <BR> <BR>When I started trying to build linguistic kerning data, my interest was less in frequency pairs per se but in determining which diacritic letters would be likely or unlikely to occur in sequence, based on a) what groups diacritics were used by a given language and b) how they were used for a language). But I soon came to the conclusion that a person could spend <i>a very long time</i> compiling such data, and still only scratch the surface, because every new language you research changes filters based on previous languages. At some stage, this process ceases to be efficient unless you decide that your fonts are only going to offer intentional kerning support for a fixed subset of languages (which is where Luc is, I believe), i.e. other languages may be supported, but only by accident. <BR> <BR>OpenType GPOS, class-based kerning is the only current mechanism that offers an efficient way of providing kerning for multiple scripts and languages in a single font. Such kerning inevitably includes support for pairs that do not actually occur in any language, but by removing the need to filter kern data in order to address application limitations, it saves a huge amount of time building linguistic kerning filters and amassing the huge amount of data necessary for such filters. Ask yourself, how should type designers be spending their time: making new fonts and spacing them, or researching letter frequency or diacritic use in hundreds of languages in order to try to accomodate yesterday's software? <BR> <BR>So, again, I'm not criticising what you've done, only tried to put its usefulness in context. I think it is important that, before font makers go out and start trying to define kern pairs based on frequency in specific languages, they consider the broader picture. This is especially important because of changes in font and layout technology.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This reminds me, ironically, of your comments re. modernism and control on the ATypI list. My approach to kerning these days is based on recognising an effectively unconquerable ignorance: we cannot know for what languages a font might be used, and we do not have time or resources to document every language on the planet to determine what kerning data might be important for each language; ergo, we should develop technologies and strategies for kerning that  acknowledge this ignorance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Brute-forcing too many pairs is worse.</i> <BR> <BR>But what is 'too many pairs'? The only limitation on number of kerning pairs that I recognise are technical limitations, i.e. bugs in software. As soon as you start supporting diacritics in kern data, the number of kerning pairs starts mushrooming. I've flattened class-based kerning in a number of OT fonts with similar character sets (pan-European Latin, Greek and Slavic Cyrillic), and they tend to have between 26,000 and 35,000 pairs. But that's only 'too many pairs' in terms of legacy applications that cannot support more than 3,000 pairs without crashing. As class-based kerning, this represents reasonable and effective kerning for <i>hundreds</i> of languages, achieved without needing to compile individual data sets on those languages. That is both quality <i>and</i> efficiency.</div>

A much greater number of languages can be supported by accepting ignorance and providing exhaustive kerning by way of classes. It is important to realise just how efficient class-based kerning is relative to defining individual kern pairs.</div>

But the point is that -like anything else, including linguistic data- its usefuless is not absolute, it depends on individual designers, and what they feel they need to do. No solution or method is equally valid for all of us - note for example how even highly accomplished designers vary in their use of hand drawing &amp; scanning, versus direct bezier design. And in my case for example I frankly don't make enough fonts with enough characters to really need class-based kerning, at least as far as I can tell (but maybe I'm wrong). <BR> <BR>&gt; one should never assume that there is no &hellip;. <BR> <BR>While I think &quot;never&quot; is not what design is about - if you get my meaning. <BR>It's the anti-control thing again. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>And there's something else: the (potential) usefulness of linguistic pair data isn't limited to kerning. As Eric Olson has demonstrated, such data can be useful in deciding what ligatures to include for example. And it can even help determine not only spacing, but actually letterform details too! Since it's all related, and a glyph doesn't exist in a vacuum. <BR> <BR>I have a nice list of <i>trigraphs</i> brewing, and kerning doesn't even go there! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; What apps support it? <BR> <BR>Heck if I know. AFAIK, nobody has built a test font for more-than-pair kerning. Without seeing it tested, I wouldn't want to assume that it works. Painful experience and wise advice has lef me to be from the &quot;if it hasn't been tested, it doesn't work&quot; school. <BR> <BR>&gt; Does class kerning handle greater than digraphs? <BR> <BR>Yes and no. Class kerning meaning the table of classes against classes is inherently oriented towards kerning one glyph against another. But one would use contextual kerning statements to do kerning of more than two glyphs in a string, and there's no reason you can't use classes in contextual kerning statements (just as one can in contextual substitution statements). <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fontographer's &quot;Kerning Assistance&quot; has been doing class-based kerning since 1993/4. <BR> <BR>For a basic Latin font without excessive kerning of non-accented lower case characters, you can kern all your cap-cap, cap-lc and lc-lc, all your accented characters, non-alphetics, and still come in under 2,000 pairs. <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>However, if you want to kern for &quot;DotCom&quot; words (which is where I draw the line), it could go a bit higher&hellip;  <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>It should be pointed out that class based kerning is only as discerning as the user makes it. For instance, it is tempting to lump V and W into the same kern class, but only if the angles of the stems are identical, which is frequently not the case.  <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>The perfect use for multi-character kerns: in abbreviated titles. If you kern your periods tightly to the caps (on both sides!), something like &quot;Y.Y&quot; has the letters colliding, so a 3-glyph exception would solve that problem (which also fools InD's Optical Kerning). But man, it would be so much work it would only be justified if you could amortize it over a large set of accented characters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, class-based kerning is not new, nor is it unique to OpenType. <BR> <BR>Of course, one shouldn't forget that there is a difference between classes as a way of generating kern pairs, and building the classes into the fonts to make for a more compact representation of kerning. <BR> <BR>One could easily automate construction of classes. It would need some tweaking, but could work pretty well. The automated class construction could be based on a static list, by looking for glyphs with identical sidebearings, or by some combination. My approach involve a static list, plus analysis of glyph names, and using that to do both class-based kerning and class-based spacing. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure what you mean by 'cascaded', Hrant. Here are some examples of things I've done with contextual kerning: <BR> <BR>When vowel or other marks are applied to Arabic text, they may collide with adjacent letters if the base is narrow or if the letters are kerned. There are two ways to solve this: by contextually repositioning the marks or by contextually rekerning the letters. Neither solution is appropriate to all situations, so the Arabic fonts I've worked on sometimes move the mark and sometimes move the letter, depending on the specific context. <BR> <BR>In Thai, the tall vowel signs need to be kern off the marks above preceding letters. Since the marks may be stacked two deep, kerning need to be contextual and to account for single marks or sequences of marks.</div>
