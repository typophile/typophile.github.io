body: Hi <BR> <BR>Mike from bowfinprintworks.com who helps out here <BR>and was kind
  enough to point me to this forum, his words were these folks know fonts <BR>  <BR>I
  am looking for a better font to use in my Flash charts. I have tried just about
  every type of font there is and am unable to find one that will give me that sharp
  detail, the Sui Generis in the chart below is one of the best I have found, The
  title is size 12 Bold, the names on the left are size 10 bold and the numbers are
  Swis 721 Blk BT size 10 Bold, the best I have found for numbers. <BR>There is no
  way to adjust the X &amp; Y axes in the Flash Chart program. <BR>I have also tried
  Fonts designed for Flash but with no better results. <BR>The Chart tech support
  suggest using very large fonts and decrease the size in the software. <BR> <BR>I
  guess its a little like mixing oil and water <BR>using fonts not designed from lines
  which is the way flash is. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.theinsidegroove.com/charts/year_stats/special/nascar-driver-season-top-20.php"

  body: 'Don, for small-to-medium text in Flash there&#39;s only one way you can get
    the most of the screen: grayscale pixelfonts. And by far the best to get them
    is Ultrafonts. <BR> <BR>Besides Miguel&#39;s Odyssey &#40;Bold or Black in this
    case&#41;, you can really push the limits of handcrafted grayscale text with my
    Mana, which however is currently too big for setting what you showed. The good
    news is that the 11 point version is almost ready&#42;. The Mana fonts are pretty
    narrow, which can be both good and bad, but it uses generous letterspacing to
    greatly increase readability. Plus the different sizes are visually highly compatible,
    allowing for &#34;total&#34; screen typography. <BR> <BR>&#42; <BR>Here&#39;s
    a quick preview of the Bold for you: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52335.gif"

    &#34;sharp detail&#34;, and to me any of the Ultrafonts seem better that the blurry
    stuff you&#39;re currently showing. Especially the ones that use grays in subtle
    ways &#40;without however going too far in blurriness&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Don, I can tell from that test that you&#39;re simply using the wrong point
    size. A pixelfont has to be set at a single given point size &#40;at a certain
    dpi&#41; to work. UPFs are pixelfonts - and they need to be set at 8 point &#40;no
    matter how many vertical pixels the font spans&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re still
    unconvinced by the Ultrafonts site &#40;or my sample&#41;, you can choose a font
    and go into &#34;Sample&#34;, and set your own text. In this case I guess you&#39;d
    also screen-grab then reverse-field it, which however brings up the possible need
    for gamma correction&#42;. So don&#39;t despair, I think you&#39;re almost there.  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that Mana comes with two versions &#40;for each size &amp;
    weight&#41;, one for positive setting, and another for higher-quality negative
    setting. The latter version can also be used as a native Windows font &#40;like
    in a word processor&#41; to great effect. <BR> <BR>hhp

    Flash file yet, <BR>when you change it to flash, the problem begins. <BR> <BR>I
    can also print these out as a JPG and no matter <BR>what font you use it is crystal
    clear, that&#39;s because it has not been converted to flash <BR> <BR>How do I
    set it to 8pt <BR> <BR>Please hang in there with me, this is something I have
    been trying to fix for to long, the frustration level is very high <BR> <BR>Don

    it has not been converted to flash <BR> <BR>Nope, that&#39;s exactly how it looks
    in Flash. <BR>Because it&#39;s made to work just right in Flash. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    How do I set it to 8pt <BR> <BR>In the box next to &#34;Sui Generis&#34;, choose
    8 instead of 10. <BR>HOWEVER: Sui Generis has to be a pixelfont, and one that&#39;s
    made to &#34;snap in place&#34; at 8 pt. Is it? <BR> <BR>All the Ultrafonts snap
    at 8 pt. <BR>Try it with Silkscreen. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The degradation you&#39;re
    describing when you output an actual Flash movie does happen with &#34;normal&#34;
    outline fonts &#40;not pixelfonts&#41;, although it&#39;s actually pretty faint:
    what you&#39;re seeing instead is mostly resolution limits wreaking havoc on letterform
    fidelity. Like you suggested earlier, it&#39;s a bit like &#34;mixing oil and
    water&#34;. But grayscale pixelfonts give the best possible results. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    from Swiff Chart.? &#41;, is sized at 100 % when embedded.. <i>&#40; It seems
    your embedded chart is smaller than the original one you created, thats why the
    text may appear too small.. &#41;</i>

  body: Because you are using a third party application to produce your charts, I
    don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to get the control you need over the exact
    pixel placement of the textfield.  <BR> <BR>This means that you can&#39;t ensure
    that your pixel font is on a whole pixel &#40;eg. 2 rather than 2.3&#41;. So,
    even if you correctly use the right font size, you&#39;ll still get blurry characters.
    <BR> <BR>Sorry for the bad news.

  body: Don, I don&#39;t know what to tell you - there&#39;s some incorrect setting
    on your end. Many people use pixelfonts &#40;b&amp;w or grayscale&#41; just fine
    and it doesn&#39;t blur &#40;when set correctly&#41;. The Ultrafonts site is Flash
    itself, and you can see everything works fine in there. Maybe read the User Guide
    on the Ultrafonts site? I know, I know, reading a manual when you&#39;re frustrated
    is not easy.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Note that <i>everything</i> in your &#34;text box&#34;
    has to be in integer pixels for a pixelfont to snap. Like if you have a line of
    13.7 Arial on the first line and then a pixelfont below it, it&#39;ll blur. Another
    thing I noticed is that you have Bold checked - try turning that off. It actually
    works with Mana, but from what I understand most pixelfonts put their weights
    under different entries. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t fret, once you get the hang of it
    you&#39;ll relish the big quality increase. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'The font you choose depends on a few things, including the importance of
    legibility versus style. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s conceivable that many people will be
    looking for their favorite racer, and since your tables have a lot of entries,
    you might like to facilitate that by having a font that makes it easy to scan-and-find
    names quickly. This means a font with: structures that people are used to seeing
    &#40;considering that most reading is done in print where fonts have a certain
    &#34;traditional&#34; look&#41;, so for example having a &#34;y&#34; with diagonal
    arms helps; sufficient interletter spacing &#40;which is actually where most pixelfonts
    fail&#41;; and capital letters that have some presence &#40;since this is all
    about proper names&#41;. <BR> <BR>Very tight and &#34;geometric&#34; pixelfonts
    are great for buttons and short headings, but not reading tasks that are performance-based.
