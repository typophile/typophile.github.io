  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,


I've been asked to identify this font, but...
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image1_6540.jpg]

I think it's a woodtype from the 19th century,
and I'm sure it's been digitalized.

Hope you guys will be more efficient.


thanks in advance.

So, perhaps you can accept a substitute - something that is similar but not the same... like:
Saddlery: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saddlery/
Railhead: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/railhead/

		<div class="commentbody">Have you looked at the book "American Wood Type" by Rob Roy Kelly? This has been mentioned numerous times as the best book on the subject.

However, it's also possible that this is not American (and I think it's more ornate than most 'Circus' types), and it may be older than 19th century. 

<a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/">Dieter Steffmann</a> has digitized a large number of initial fonts, but unfortunately he doesn't show samples all at once, and you need to search each possibility.

Thanks for your interest Mike.

#1
I'd love to look inside that book (I've come across it several times while searching...) but I don't have it, and the local libraries either.
#2
Thanks also for the link, I'll watch this stuff carefully.
#3
I agree with you, I'm beginning to doubt it's an American, and it might be older.

Anyway, I'm quite sure it's been digitized as I've seen it printed at the top of a text set in Futura.

I've given another look at the original image

#1 my memory was wrong, it was near Gill, not Futura (at least your remark remains valid ) 

#2 This F has been scanned on a print ad for a nice lamp from a designy furniture store.
those ads need to look like oldstyle, but I'm 90% sure the company that sells the lamps did not print those ads with an old printer.
 here is the full image :
