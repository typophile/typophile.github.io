  \ Here are two movie fonts that I'm looking for.  If anyone can help identify them,

  body: 'Thanks for the quick response, Mike, but none of the fonts mentioned on the
    other thread are an exact match.  The most noticeable difference is in the flat
    tops of the capital A and M, whereas Novel Gothic has pointed tops.  The incline
    in the foot of the capital L is also very unique.  I have at one time found this
    exact font somewhere on the web, but I''ve forgotten the name.  '

  body: "Hmmm, I didn't pay attention to that when I saw the triangles for the A and
    F. It seems obvious that Novel Gothic was used in making this font. Have you searched
    the Sans fonts at Dafont.com?  Such a 'mutilation' is most often the sort of thing
    that find its way into the free download sites. Start with a known font, and alter
    the outlines (the top stroke of the F has been cut off at an angle too), and voil\xE1
    you have a 'new' font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
