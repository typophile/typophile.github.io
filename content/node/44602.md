  -- that essentially covers all the Unicode ranges devoted to mathematical symbols.
  Everything works perfectly on my Mac, but certain glyphs do not appear in the Windows
  Character Map. Specifically, the missing glyphs -- which are at 239B through 23B1
  in the \"Miscellaneous Technical\" range -- are the parenthesis, bracket, and brace
  \"sections\" that one can piece together to form large or multiline delimiters.
  These glyphs are also found in the Symbol font, and possibly that's where Windows
  \"expects\" them to be (whatever that means).  In addition to the issue with Character
  Map, I am told by programmers that they are not able to \"find\" those glyphs in
  the font. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that someone here has some idea what might be causing
  this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSelwyn"

  body: Are you certain that the missing glyphs are correctly encoded in the font?
    If the Windows Character Map can't find them, that might be a clue that there's
    something wrong with the font (or charmap.exe -- I recall using a version that
    was tied to a specific version of Unicode).

  body: "You might try experimenting with the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html\">Firefox
    3 beta</a>, it reads the font character map directly.  These characters are used
    in MathML and I confirmed that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/texvsmml.xhtml\">this
    test page</a> actually pulls in characters within the range you're concerned about.
    \ To use your font, edit the source and add a style pointing to your font:\r\n<code>\r\n
    \ mrow { font-family: \"My Font\"; }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlso, tools like ttx (open
    source) and ftxdumperfuser (part of the Apple font tools) can dump out the cmap
    tables if you need to verify the codepoints within the cmap.\r\n\r\nIt almost
    sounds like the programmers you're dealing with are trying to use only GDI calls
    it a situation where they need to use Uniscribe, but I might be talking through
    my arse on that one.  The Windows version of the Symbol font uses the legacy symbol
    character map format that should best be avoided, especially in your situation.
    \ If your font works in Firefox, you can point programmers at the Firefox code
    and let them figure it out.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/gfx/thebes/src/\r\n\r\n"

    if not that would be a breach of licenses, which font developers should be especially
    sensitive about.\r\n\r\nTry BabelMap as a character map. You'll love it. (along
    with BabelPad, but BableMap is even more useful). I wouldn't want to live with
    a computer without BabelMap anymore.\r\n\r\n"

    these characters in Notepad or Wordpad?\r\n\r\nCharmap has a database of character
    names and ranges, so it is tied to particular version of Unicode.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

  body: "Thanks to everyone for the comments and suggestions. I've played around with
    ftxanalyzer and  ftxdumperfuser, and the only thing that seemed out of whack was
    the maxp table, which apparently is corrupted. (A couple of other fonts I made
    with FontLab showed the same.) Is it possible this could be the problem?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the Firefox 3 beta renders the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/texvsmml.xhtml\">mathml
    test page</a> perfectly in my font on my Mac. Thanks for that suggestion, jdaggett.
    Still awaiting word on how it displays in Windows."

    if someone is only fiddling with Mozilla code to figure out which Windows API
    calls are made to successfully render the characters in question.\r\n\r\nIf you
    work at Microsoft you're officially not allowed to view Mozilla source but this
    is an internal Microsoft policy not something required by any license.\r\n\r\n"

    wrong and you right), that just \"looking at it to figure out\" puts you in a
    difficult position defending yourself when accused of having _used_ (and possibly
    altered) the code.\r\nThe borders between \"taken and altered\" and \"looked at,
    got inspired, and did it from scratch\" are blurry."
