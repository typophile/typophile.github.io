body: I am an engraver and have recently run across a font that I just can't seem
  to identify.  It appears to be a Times Roman font but the numbers tend to look more
  like a Goudy style.  Please help me to identify this style, as i have not been able
  to locate it in Omega, Adobe, or Corel's Font libraries.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engraving

  body: "It may well be a Goudy style: National Oldstyle, released by ATF. There's
    a \"commercial\" version here...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html\r\n\r\nbut
    I can't vouch for its quality."

  body: I was recently told that it is Roman Modified and definitely not Modified
    Roman.  I have looked high and low for this Font and cannot find it.  Any suggestions
    on where to look?
