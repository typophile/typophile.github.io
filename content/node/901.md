body: 'Hrant &#40;from the critique of Seriatim Gestalt&#41;:  <BR> <BR>&#62; Which
  reminds me of an experiment I&#39;ve <BR>&#62; been considering: making a font &#40;probably
  <BR>&#62; out of Times&#41; that substitutes other letters <BR>&#62; for the real
  ones, with some minimal <BR>&#62; manipulation. Like taking an &#34;e&#34;, rotating
  it <BR>&#62; 180, and adding a small curling stroke to <BR>&#62; the bottom-right:
  one messed-up &#34;a&#34;!  <BR> <BR>I think it was David Carson who did something
  like that with Times Roman. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a version of that idea using Seriatim.
  The ground rules: Characters had to be used as they are, with no manipulations other
  than rotating, shifting or flipping. Characters could not be used to represent themselves
  &#40;I followed this one pretty well, with the exception of the upper-case &#34;U&#34;,
  which I flipped horizontally, and the at &#34;@&#34;, which I flipped vertically&#41;.
  I allowed this rule to lapse for most of the nonalphabetics and nonnumerics. <BR>
