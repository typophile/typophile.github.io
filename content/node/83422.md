  body: I couldn't find a cheap font similar enuf to Chalet Paris 1970 (and def can't
    afford to buy it now) so I built up the piece I needed custom. It turned out pretty
    good... not so hard since it's almost all circles and straights. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Built-Up-Chalet-Paris-1970-Copy_3942.jpg]

  body: "The same things that make it bad to most people who hang around here - just
    wait until the morning (unless the right Oceanians happen to be paying attention).
    The weights are imbalanced: between horizontals & verticals (the latter have to
    be thicker to appear the same), between straights & rounds (look how light the
    \"r\" looks), and between caps & lc (the former need to be thicker to look heavy
    enough). Also, the straight-curve joins exhibit the classic problem (called the
    \"bone effect\" by some) of looking unsmooth (compare yours to the original) because
    there has to be a slight shift away from pure geometric parts.\r\n\r\nIt is in
    fact an interesting paradox in type design that the \"simpler\" it has to <em>look</em>
    the more complex it actually has to <em>be</em>! Take a close look at Futura for
    example.\r\n\r\nAll this should serve not to embarrass you (you're not a type
    designer [yet] so it's OK) but to reveal some of the darkness in this black art
    of ours.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Also, there's something called overshoot: round (and pointy) bits have to
    overshoot an alignment line to actually appear to align there; so in the \"a\"
    for example look how the little stem part seems to go lower than the circle -
    the circle has to be made to go lower in order to appear to line up (and the amount
    to overshoot depends on how large the type will be viewed).\r\n\r\nBTW, the eye
    in your \"e\" is much bigger than the original's.\r\n\r\nLastly, spacing: it seems
    you've replicated the original's, but the \"Da\" is too tight even in the original.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow,
    Chalet is indeed expensive.\r\nBut if time is money, and you want it to look just
    right...  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@hrant- Thanx for all the input, it's really very interesting. I appreciate
    the chance to learn about these kinds of details.\r\n\r\nThe project this is for
    doesn't have the time for me to improve what I've done, and the audience for it
    almost certainly won't know or care about my rookie work. But this experience
    has definitely started a little fire inside me for the black art you speak of
    : )\r\n\r\nThanx again."
