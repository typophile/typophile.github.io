  final font must be usable in InDesign. What I plan to do is to have a set of caps
  named A.tall B.tall . . . Z.tall and implement them through a stylistic set, rather
  than fib about the \"normal\" caps by calling them \"petite.\" (I don't think InDesign
  supports the petite caps feature yet, does it?) Can anybody think of why this won't
  work, or a better solution?\r\n\r\nTIA"

  body: Yes, a stylistic set will work (in InDesign, at least), and yes, InDesign
    doesn't support the 'pcap' feature yet.

  body: "It would be easier to make a separate Tall Caps font. That way all you would
    have to do is substitute the gylphs in the normal cap spots, and you'd get features
    like c2sc, smcp and case without a lot of messing around with classes and coding.\r\n\r\nAnd
    you would be able to recognize and specify the different versions at the top level
    of the app, without having to dive down into the OT menu.\r\n\r\nThat is the benefit
    of the feature being named in plain English, as part of the font name. Stylistic
    sets are problematic because they are an uninformative code number: a descriptive
    name field which shows in the application menu would be helpful, but it hasn't
    been implemented yet. So the typographer has to play \"spot the difference\" or,
    heaven forbid, consult a reference document, to figure out what the feature does. "

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nNick, it all depends on what you are doing. As a font user
    rather than a font maker, I really prefer all glyphs in one font. Suppose, for
    example, that I need to go back to a font and change kerning between two lower-case
    pairs. Or add a character. Or change a character. Or. . . With one font, you make
    the change(s) and are done with it. With split fonts, you have to remember to
    make it in both.  That is the primary reason I made up database fonts when we
    were using the Type 1 format. More work starting out, but a lot less work in font
    maintenance.\r\n\r\nI can live without case. As for cpsp, most book designers
    specify the amount of letterspacing for caps & small caps, and it is hardly every
    the amount you build in with cpsp. c2sc is nice, but there is 10+ years of authors
    & editors putting (eventual) small caps in the lower case due to the Type-1 font
    structures. Yes, it makes the downstream document harder to prepare, but you know
    history.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at titl, though.\r\n\r\nThe cpsp code reminds
    me of a funny story. Sumner Stone, trying to save the ignorant from themselves,
    built in a rather generous right sidebearing with the small caps in a font (Type
    1). The small caps set by themselves did look pretty good. But when you had Cap-small
    caps, things went to hell in a hurry -- the letter following a cap was tighter
    to it than to the following letter. Punctuation also was a problem -- which would
    include abbreviations that used the period (e.g., B.C.).\r\n\r\nMoral: you can't
    save the ignorant from themselves, and for the moment anyway, there is still a
    bit of use for compositors.\r\n\r\nThanks to all"

    a post to it in support of your stylistic set naming scheme. Did it ever show
    up? I never saw it but since I was new to the list, I thought itmay have been
    posted before I got my first Sunday night group post.\r\n\r\nIf it didn't make
    it. I will post to it again.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
