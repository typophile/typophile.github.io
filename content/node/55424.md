body: "I'm a bit of an idiot and am looking at getting my freelancing feet wet in
  the very near future. I am wondering if anyone may have some resource suggestions
  regarding both the average, going rates of design these days, as well as something
  on turnaround time, be they good books, websites or anything in-between. I have
  never worked an official design job, don't have any designer friends and the few
  projects I have done in the past have been for people I know well, so worked pro
  bono or very, very cheap, and deadlines were never very strict, giving me the luxury
  of taking the scenic route: I wouldn't know what to tell a stranger who needs a
  logo or tri-fold how much it would be, nor when they would have it by.\r\n\r\nI
  know I've seen some books on the shelves that may cover some of this information,
  but whenever I've had money for a book I'd buy the pretty ones with lots of slick
  pictures of different work, never the one that could maybe help me on my way, oh,
  no, of course not. Well, it's time that changed, so if you may know of one in particular
  that'd be a great help \u2013 and start.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nMatthew"

    Guidelines</em>, available cheap at Amazon or most bookstores. You aren\u2019t
    going to get many people to respond with their own hourly or per-project rates
    in a web forum (for legal, ethical, and competitive reason) and because prices
    vary wildly by locale, your best bet is to make friends with some local designers
    who can advise you."

    is for you. Based on that, you can work backwards towards finding a valid hourly
    rate for your work.

    network! Check out any talks or presentations by graphic designers, for example.
    <a href=\"http://aigalosangeles.org/\">Your local AIGA</a> might be a place to
    start, but check out other possibilities. You're not screwed unless you give up
    before you start. :-)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, if you've had a chance to do some work,
    even for people you knew, that is an advantage, especially if you can put that
    work in a portfolio."

    I like for freelance info is freelanceswitch.com. Check out the forums. They also
    have a nifty rate calculator: freelanceswitch.com/rates/. Warning, the rates calculator
    does not account for taxes, which can be as much as 45% (or more) of your gross
