    smell that something isn't quite right and that may cause them to be generally
    suspicious of your submission. \r\n\r\nPerhaps keeping the body in Arial 12pt
    would stay within the letter of the law but do something more interesting with
    the display typography and any captioning or small print.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: Akzidenz Grotesk, Helvetica's parent, has a much smaller x-height and better
    spacing. Use that at 12 point, and the suits might not notice, but the overall
    effect would be much less [[horsey]]. Might even be pleasant, readable even!

    why your new and improved version is much better, and suggest that they take it
    up. Don't just change it, you are being paid by them afterall! Think long-term,
    break them in. If they aren't interested, then do you really want to work with
    them?

    paper is for me, I'm in a contest for a business coaching and funding program
    and all the papers are required to be set in Arial at 12pt, so I guess the client
    is going to be pleased with the change ;).\r\n\r\nUnica and Galaxie Polaris are
    very nice options which I would love to try but I only have Helv\xE9tica and some
    weights of Azkidenz Grotesk so I think I'm going to stick to any of those two.
    \r\n\r\nNow I understand the reason behind asking such a specific setting: avoiding
    people to deliver business papers in 14pt Comic Sans... I even understand why
    the chose Arial: it's everywhere. But at 12pt? it looks huge and horrible to me.
    Sometimes they even ask Arial 12pt double spaced =/\r\n\r\nUnica seems to have

      they've asked for it in Arial 12pt to stop submitters trying to be creative
      with their typography so that they can concentrate on what the proposal actually
      says.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, if they're asking so specifically for something,
      it's best to give it to them as asked. You may be penalised for trying to be
      creative :) While they may not notice the difference between your alternate
      choice and Arial in isolation, put next to a number of other documents all set
      in Arial 12pt, yours will stick out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nI'd just bite
      the bullet and go with Arial if I were you.\r\n\r\nJordan"

  body: "H\xE9ctor - Like other Scangraphic fonts, Unica comes in two versions with
    varying spacing. From the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?mid=22\">Scangraphic
    Fonts page</a> at FontShop:\r\n\r\n<em>Scangraphic offers an extensive range of
    fonts, all available in two special Scangraphic design formats called \u201CBodytext\u201D
    and \u201CHeadline\u201D.\r\n\r\nScangraphic Bodytext (\u201CSB\u201D) faces are
    ideal for text in small point sizes. The hairlines and serifs of the Bodytext
    faces are thicker than normal hairlines and serifs to make them more legible in
    fine print. In addition to this, they have a special ink-traps incorporated in
    the font design to prevent blurring and loss of print quality.\r\n\r\nThe Scangraphic
    Headline (\u201CSH\u201D) faces are made for text in large point sizes. Scangraphic
    optimized the Headline fonts specifically for this purpose, for example, by narrowing
    the spacing of the fonts and re-designing the umlauts in order to make them work
    better aesthetically with the overall design.</em>"

  body: "H\xE9ctor, I feel your pain. About once every 2 months I have to deal with
    an RFP that specifies \"Arial 12 pt\". What's worse, it will also have a page
    limit, and the engineers I work with consider that a challenge to cram as many
    words on a page as possible. The result is Arial set 12/12, on a 48 pica line.
    Makes me cringe, but I get a paycheck every 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nI think one option
    is to use arial, but use it well. Some very good typography has been done w/ grotesks.
    The fact that some really ugly typography has been done w/ arial shouldn't stop
    you from using it.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to do a work-man job on a arial version,
    then do an excellent job on an alternate version w/ a different typeface. Use
    this as an opportunity to educate someone as to the joys of typography.\r\n\r\nJay"
