  body: dc <BR> <BR>Sure doesn&#39;t look like URW Wood Type D to me. <BR> <BR>Stephen&#39;s
    right. But tuscans are a generic form of wood type originally derived from late
    18th/early 19th century French metal face designs. The tuscans vary quite a bit.
    <BR> <BR>Where is your specimen from?

  body: hey Bieler, <BR> <BR>Ummmm...It looks like URW WT D with a little bit of embellishment.
    Yeah, I agree with you, that Tuscan is a generic name after some research. I got
    this from the web, it was part of a logo design on the site. Don&#39;t you think
    the person added the little balls to the type or you think it&#39;s some other
    face that comes just like it?

  body: 'dc <BR> <BR>There were tuscans with the &#34;little balls.&#34; I&#39;ve
    seen a near dead ringer for this in Gray&#39;s Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces.
    But your showing is an inverse. By the end of the century the metal foundries
    began copying the wood type designs and essentially took the wind out of the sails
    of the wood type manufacturers. Everyone was copying everything so it is almost
    impossible to pin down. <BR> <BR>But if you scrounge around a bit on the web you
    will find a similar situation today. Lots of copies of old wood type designs are
    available, and metal too, of course. In some cases these might be reworked a bit,
    at least commercial designs, but a lot of the freeware and shareware stuff are
    straight copies. Sometimes useful because of that if you are only interested in
    specimens. '

  body: 'Thanks for the feedback Bieler, can you name one specimen that&#39;s similiar
    to this with the &#34;lil balls&#34; ornamented Type? If it&#39;s not too much
    troubles for you. <BR>I&#39;m trying to track down this font, as close as possible
    in resemblance. Yep, there are too many wood type fonts in too many different
    styles, but the closest so far I have found was the URW Woodcut D.... '

    it had the T.A. reference attached to it, meaning it was taken from an advertisement
    way back when. <BR> <BR>But if you are trying to find the digital font this is
