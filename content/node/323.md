  body: I don&#39;t think there is a way to open font suitcases in OS X. This seems
    like an obvious kind of utility that would have been cooked up by now, but it
    hasn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>This is one of the reasons that, while I use OS X for everything
    else, I still keep another machine around running OS 9 for most of my font development.
    At least for the near term.

  body: This has bugged me since day one. That and the fact that both suitcase and
    printer font icons are the same. What is Apple thinking?

    <BR> <BR>Anyway, Type 1 PostScript fonts are dead, in OpenType you haven&#39;t
    any suitcases.

  body: I hear you, Tiff. This has bugged my hairs too. By the by, when you double
    click on any font file in Panther &#40;10.3&#41;, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/font_book.html">FontBook</a>
    opens to display the contents of the file &#40;OpenType/.ttf/.pfb/suitcase/whatever...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>g.
