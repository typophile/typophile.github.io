  greatly appreciate people&#39;s opinions on this. <BR> <BR>What would you say are
  the most popular and best looking business fonts to use on a business letterhead?
  I&#39;m hoping to get a top 3 list. <BR> <BR>Thanks all! <BR> <BR>Karl

  body: Karl I don&#39;t think there is a top 20 list. What might help is posting
    the name of the business. Maybe the characters will evoke an opinion on typefaces
    that would work for you.

    although I am very wary of typographic clich

  body: All, <BR> <BR>Need to clarify. <BR> <BR>This is engraving done for my personal
    cover letters and thank you letters &#40;name, address, phone, and e-mail&#41;.
    I don&#39;t have a business.  <BR> <BR>Even though it&#39;s for personal correspondence,
    they need to look extremely business professional. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the confusion.

  body: Since you said that you do not have a business, and that this is for &#39;personal
    correspondence&#39;, it sounds like you want something formal. Perhaps that&#39;s
    what you mean when you say &#39;professional&#39;? <BR> <BR>You still have an
    almost unlimited selection, because you could use formal scripts, serif fonts
    or sans serif fonts. <BR> <BR>I would expect that the place that will be making
    your stationery will have many styles that they can recommend, and if this is
    truly &#39;engraving&#39; they may not have many conventional &#40;digital&#41;
    fonts that we can recommend. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, since this is being used to
    represent YOU, it should be your decision about which style represents you best.
    You will also be able to avoid the issue about licensing if you just use the typefaces
    your stationery printer has in his collection. <BR> <BR>If you still want ideas,
    though, I am sure people here can tell you what they see a lot for this kind of
    stationery.

  body: Karl, if you are going to have stationery engraved, I suggest you get in touch
    with the engraver you plan to use.  <BR> <BR>During my college days I use to work
    for an engraving shop and fonts were limited. But the salesperson always tried
    to find a font that fit the personality of the client. It was one of the reasons
    the shop was one of the top three in Manhattan, back in engraving days - not an
    easy feat. <BR> <BR>Make sure it is a font you are comfortable with and helps
    express yourself. True engraving was something you lived with - was very expensive,
    and no room for errors. <BR> <BR>BTW, you could always design your own today,
    and they have paper plates....
