body: "I've just recently started using FontLab Studio 5.\r\nI know I'm being lazy,
  but is there any quick way or shortcuts for creating different weights for an entire
  font family.\r\n\r\nI tend to design most of my fonts in Illustrator CS, but find
  the <b>'stroke'</b> function doesn't quite work for the different weights.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure the only solution is hard work, but I was just wondering if anyone had any
  good techniques for solving this problem?\r\n\r\nI have even tried designing an
  ultra thin font, and then the ultra fat, then morphing the rest using the <b>'Blend
  Tool'</b> and a specific number of steps.\r\nThis seems to be the quickest method
  so far, although it can produce some very unexpected results if the number of points
  don't match.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    Path\".\r\nActions > Effects > Bold is also very useful, especially in the way
    it can be weighted differently for x and y axes.\r\nYou might take a look at Superpolator."

  body: "@ Nick. That all sounds perfect for my needs. Although I've just tried to
    work how to use  the 'Make Parallel Path\", with little success.\r\n\r\nThe www.Superpolator.com
    software is exactly what I am looking. Looks amazing, I think I will have to make
    a purchase.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks."

    a sort of living blend function. Superpolator is much more flexible, of course.\r\n\r\nT"
