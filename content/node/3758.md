    <BR>Enlarging the image didn&#39;t really help. If you  <BR>squint at the original,
    then squint at the sample  <BR>in the link I posted, there are some similarities.

    from Paratype. With all of the distortion, <BR>it will take an expert &#40;Troubleman?
    Coles? Chesh?&#41; to ID it properly.

  body: 'Isaac, that helps a lot. I never thought of it as a distorted humanist face.
    That helps a lot. I think it may even be Fruitiger black or something. I just
    found out that the this snippet is actually from a logo--the cineza logo for Sony&#39;s
    line of home projectors. They could have simply modified the z &#40;pointy tips&#41;
    and distorted Fruitiger or some other humanist face. Thanks isaac. '
