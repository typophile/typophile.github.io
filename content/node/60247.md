  script style. If you have a minute, I'd love some opinions on this. The letters
  are I E A (Ingrid Elisabet & Anders). I'll spell the names out underneath.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mono_5503.png]"

  body: "The letter \u201CI\u201D it\u2019s always a tricky one. The risk I see here
    is that it may end up visually as an ornament of the \u201CE\u201D instead of
    a separate letter.\r\nI would also check the first stroke of the \u201CA\u201D,
    which don\u2019t get along with the others...\r\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t be
    able to come up with something so good! :-)"

  body: I was confused by the relative closeness of I and E. I first tried to read
    them as a single letter (N?). It seems strange that I and A run together while
    the E is unconnected with either.

  body: I apologize if this come across as too heavy but these pattens of heavy &
    light don't make sense to me even in a mannerist model. The left side of the a
    in particular seems like a compromise not a definite act. Also if you are going
    to be mannerist think about what you want to emphasize and why. Being mannerist
    is a license - use it. The second smaller heavy part of the E for instance - why
    is it compteting with the identity of the E? I would think about it & do it again.

  body: "It's not at all heavy, Eben. I find these kind of things hard to pull of.
    The style seems to be created with two kind of tools, one wide \u2013 one very
    thin. You're right about the left stroke on A. I wanted it to resemble an upstroke
    with a wide pen, that's why I thinned it out slightly."

  body: "I too tried to read the IE as a single character at first. After reading
    your post I had no problem with reading it.\r\nIn my eyes, the A needs the most
    work. As the horizontal stroke now looks more as an embellishment than part of
    the letterform.\r\n\r\n(funnily enough I'm working on an wedding monogram myself,
    although in a completly different style: [[http://typophile.com/node/60527]])"

  body: Absolutely gorgeous. One thing I see is that the distribution of weight causes
    it to look like the letter spacing between the E and A is much greater than I
    and A.

  body: "\"The style seems to be created with two kind of tools, one wide \u2013 one
    very thin.\"\r\n\r\nThis genre is done with one pen. A pointed nib. The thicks
    and thins are achieved with pressure and release.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you are
    going to draw it with a monoline thin pen and add the thicks later you must look
    at it as a chessboard with accompanying thoughts of what \"Copperplate letters\"
    should look like. This will mean you will have to use models of Copperplate to
    define the thicks/thins on chosen letters and then wing it to \"fatten up\" dead
    spots (very thin areas like the left side of the I). Does this make sense?\r\n\r\nJust
    like the \"Roman\" the left side of the A should be thin... and to fill you could
    add weight to the A crossbar or the right hand flourish of the E. That should
    fill in the \"hole.\"\r\n\r\nYes the A is too distant from the other letters and
    I have indicated where you might think about adding taper to equal it all out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_3817.png]\r\nMichael"
