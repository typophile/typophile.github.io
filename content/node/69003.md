body: "As the 100th font released by CheapProFonts, I wanted to make something special
  - so I have chosen to upgrade one of the most popular free fonts ever: the one and
  only Scriptina by the infamous Fredrick \"Apostrophe\" Nader!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scriptina_Pro_450_6488.gif]\r\n\r\nAfter
  first cleaning up the outlines, spacing and kerning, Scriptina Pro has been expanded
  with a set of alternate letters without the loops and swashes, using the OpenType
  contextual alternates feature to switch them around automatically to avoid too many
  overlapping and repeating elements. You can also manually turn off the loops and
  swashes with the OpenType titling and swash features respectively. The originals
  alternate letters have been incorporated as stylistic alternates (and stylistic
  set 02) and the ligatures as discretionary ligatures if you should want them. The
  alternate non-script lowercase z is programmed as stylistic set 01.\r\n\r\nIn addition
  Scriptina Pro has been given the usual CheapProFonts large multilingual character
  set, of course. I hope many will enjoy the improvements and additional language
  support.\r\n\r\nAnd, naturally: it is still free! :)\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n--

  - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!"
