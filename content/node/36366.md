body: "When sharing photos/images of your work or requesting a Type ID (please post
  to the Type ID Board <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">here</a>) would you
  be so kind as to use the \"Insert Image\" feature supported by Typophile.\r\n\r\nI've
  noticed a lot of people using Photobucket to host their images. This is normally
  fine, but for some people it's not. Reason being, most companies have internal filters
  that block access to Photo/File hosting sites like Photobucket or Imageshack. It's
  annoying and it limits the opportunity for someone to see the images you're sharing.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  if you link to an external website, this will not guarantee that the image originally
  linked to will stay that way a day later, a week, a month or even a year later.
  This cripples that historical benefits of Typophile, which keeps a running log of
  all the posts on the site. So when a visual reference is corrupted because it was
  linked to an external website, it could potentially ruin the value of that post
  rendering it useless.\r\n\r\nFor more information on posting files/photos read this
