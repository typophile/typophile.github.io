  body: "According to its bumpyness I\u2019d say it\u2019s a freebie. Did you check
    dafont?\r\n\r\nEdit: Or else a selfmade font by the agency. Strange though, it
    looks somehow familiar\u2026"

    I had a quick check of dafont but couldn't see anything. I doubt a design agency
    would be using freebies for their  identity, but hey you never know!\r\n\r\nI
    agree it does look familiar, I'm sure I've seen it used on food packaging before?\r\n\r\nThanks
    guys!"
