body: "Today I decided to set up a blog and stay on it! I tried wordpress and blogger
  but wasn't happy with the layout etc so why not put down my ideas on a blog related
  to a subject that I am very much interested in at the moment?\r\n\r\nThe past few
  days I have been following and reading almost every article on the personal blogs
  of two Lebanese designers: Pascal Zoghbi and Nadine Chahine. I really loved Pascals
  blog better ( sorry Nadine!)They both did their MA in typography and Arabic type
  design which is the main reason why I tried to investigate the subjects they researched
  on and the impact it has had on their work.\r\n\r\nI am in a rush to leave but will
  shortly upload what I have come across in a separate blog :-)"
