body: "Looking for a classical Dutch typeface other than those by DTL and Teff (which
  I can\u2019t afford), I hit upon Monotype\u2019s Van Dijk. The regular shape looks
  clean and readable, and some alternative figures are simply delightful (look at
  the three!). Unfortunately, the italic is said to be so badly designed and so poorly
  spaced \u201Cthat makes it a very uninteresting font to use in digital form\u201D.
  (Norman Walsh) \r\nMy issue: does anyone know Van Dijk? Or have seen it somewhere
  applied? Is it worth to be bought regardless of the italic? Thank you!\r\n"
