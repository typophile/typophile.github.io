  any of you had a simple answer for me. The problem is this: I am building an iOS
  app that allows users to create photobooks on their phone. The problem comes in
  with the type. I have the font sent to -40 tracking in inDesign but unfortunately
  the iPhone SDK does not allow for tracking between characters without some pretty
  headache-inducing coding. So now I'm thinking of tacking a different tack: adjusting
  the tracking in-font using software like FontLab. Any ideas how to do this? Is it
  even possible?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    by -40, Apply to entire font, OK.\r\n\r\nI don't know if \"-40 tracking\" in InDesign
    is -40 units-per-em or some other measure, so check.\r\n\r\nMake sure the font
    license allows such modifications."

  body: Thanks so much for your answer. I'll look into the font's license to see if
    it's copacetic for me to make that kind of alteration.
