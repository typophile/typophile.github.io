  big text saved as images). Aesthetically, the CG Symphony is just fine. We need
  to expand language support (tricky ones are Russian, Latvian and Lithuanian) but
  CG Symphony\u2019s character range is quite small.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the worthy
  (and similar!) alternative to CG Symphony? Properly hinted webfont version would
  be a great bonus. At least: normal, italic, bold and bold italic.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Yes, yes, it's true... CG Symphony = Syntax. I was there during the big \"CG\"
    development phase. It was during the \"we won't license to Compugraphic\" days
    by the majority of European foundries. You can generally find the original equivalent
    typeface of a \"CG\" font by the first one to four letters:\r\nCG Palacio = Palatino\r\nCG
    Omega = Optima\r\netc. (with the exception of CG Triumvirate = Helvetica)\r\n\r\nJust
    a bit of useless type development history."
