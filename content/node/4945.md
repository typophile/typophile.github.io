  layers of type? <BR> <BR>I am designing a DVD menu system and each menu item has
  a top layer, a middle outline layer, and a bottom offset layer for a drop shadow
  effect.  I have to translate this system into three languages and it&#39;s turning
  out to be a big pain in the &#149;&#149;&#149; to edit three type layers for every
  item x three languages! <BR> <BR>I tried making a text style but it only works on
  one layer of type. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>peter '

  body: I think maybe you&#39;re going at the problem backwards. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    no reason you need to use more than one layer for this. Use a stroke on the type,
    and use Illustrator&#39;s own drop shadow capabilities. <BR> <BR>The stroke will
    tend to erode the type. If Illustrator doesn&#39;t have the option to simply place
    the stroke behind the object &#40;not sure&#41;, you can set the path offset to
    half the stroke thickness, and that should eliminate the problem. <BR> <BR>Regards,

  body: Huh. I&#39;ve been playing around with this in Illustrator and you <b>can</b>
    do exactly what you want.  <BR> <BR>The key is to modify the appearance of the
    text by selecting it as an <b>object</b> &#40;using the arrow tool&#41;, not as
    <b>text</b> &#40;using the text tool&#41;. When it is in object mode, you can
    change the stacking order of the stroke and fill in the appearance palette. You
    can&#39;t when the text is selected as text.  <BR> <BR>Doing it this way means
    that the effects will apply to the whole text block, but that would only be a
    problem if you wanted to use the style within a text block. It doesn&#39;t sound
    like that&#39;s the case.  <BR> <BR>You change the stacking order of the strokes
    and fills by dragging them up and down in the Appearance palette. Also, you can
    add as many strokes and fills as needed and modify them with the Effects menu.
    With the appropriate stroke or fill selected in the Appearance palette, use Effects
    -&#62; Distort &amp; Transform -&#62; Transform to do the dropshadow effect.

    <BR>5. In the Appearance palette, drag the yellow Fill layer to above the Stroke

  body: Thanks Peter for alerting me to this thread! <BR>My book &#40;<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com</a>&#41; was completed just
    as Adobe released Illustrator CS. I was able to acknowledge--somewhat in passing--that
    the new AI version had 3-D extrude tools, but I couldn&#39;t say more.  <BR> <BR>I
    just played around with Appearance and 3D extrude with ambient shading in AI CS
    and yes, they add a whole new dimension. It&#39;s a miracle!  <BR> <BR>There are
    a few problems, though. The shading gets put in as bands that are too low res.
    Each band is an individual object which makes editing difficult &#40;too many
    points flying around&#41; and gets us into issues of trapping if we&#39;re doing
    this for publication.  <BR> <BR>Also, I tried a couple of layers of fills and
    strokes followed by a 3D extrude and when it was done, 3 of my letters ended up
    behind the top fill layer, so this is a bug, I presume.   <BR> <BR>The revision
    of my book--eventually--will have to cover these new AI features, though! However,
    I&#39;m thinking that I would still very likely build my own shadows because there&#39;s
    always a superficial feeling to out-of-the-box features like these. But maybe  <BR>I&#39;m
    just futilely trying to resist progress. <BR>Leslie <BR> <BR>

  body: Also, one caveat about the &#34;cast shadow&#34; effect I did in the second
    sample... It&#39;s made of individual copies of the black stroke layer, so if
    you zoom in or print it out you would see tiny stair steps. One way around this
    is to increase the number of steps and reduce the distance between them. The other
    would be to not rely on such a short cut and actually draw it. The 3-d extrude
    can do it too, but it tends to be a little imprecise for this kind of shadow and
    the artwork you get when you expand the appearance is a little, I don&#39;t know,
    messy.
