body: It seems to me that Adobe Illustrator &#40;10&#41; messes with the font kerning.
  Oddly enough, the excact same kerning pairs shows up just fine in programs like
  Word and Photo Shop. <BR>I noticed this when testing kerning in AI...Anyone else
  experienced something like this? <BR> <BR>Jakob / pizzadude.dk
