  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

My client is a job agency called "TimeZeit", a combination of the English "time" and its German equivalent "Zeit". The client wants a slick solution that appeals to job seekers and corporate clients equally, and that will stand the test of "time" (joke).

However, I am finding it very difficult to come up with any ideas. Incorporating a clock in the logo seems obvious, however having the concept of time appear three times in the logo may be too flamboyant.

Since the business is essentially a people business, I also tried variations that had humans in it, for example humans forming a circle (= clock!), seen from above - with varying degrees of success.

This is the latest idea I came up with and that I would like your opinion on:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_B_4300.png]

These would be some other concepts:

Thanks for any help in this matter!</div>

It is not pleasant this way. Especialy between the 'ti' and 'it'.

Beside that...

It is very minimalistic.
But you said it is a people business. I always find these concepts are to distant from people. It is clean and I do not get a warm, fuzzy feel. It does not attract me!

Interesting what you have done with the 'ti' and 'it'.
But it isn't for a church. The cross is to apparent.

It could also be a wordmark for a newspaper. But perhaps I'm seeing that because I am redesigning a newspaper. ;-)

Hope this helps, again. Because you did already show the other two variants.
;-)

Is it targeting any particular industry?

Its hard to say without knowing a bit more about the company, but the options above aren't really jumping out at me.</div>

So I would avoid any visual reference to time or clocks. I feel the last one (on the bottom) with the people in the circle is a bit overdone and confusing. I would incorporate "RECRUITMENT AGENCY" or the German equivalent into the logo and get done with it because this ain't getting any better with a name like that :)

Hope this helps.

And apologies for starting a new thread. The previous one was simply getting too embarrassing...

In essence, the job agency provides bulk job ads to corporate clients of all kinds. They are not targeting any particular industry. Nor are they dealing with job seekers in any way (my initial post was a little misleading here).

This would be an earlier concept of ours:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6088.png]

However, I couldn't find a way to tie the people to the wordmark in any useful manner. I also feel like the concept of people in a logo is a bit worn out, especially in a job agency. What do you think? Which logo has got the most potential?

Definately the first one. Number two, as you said, is too much like a watchmaker and sorry but i hate number 3 - far too fussy. You are right to avoid people - too cliched.

Having said that, if someone at my work was on this project I'd advise them to do further explorations. What would it look like with really tight tracking - like the Wolf Olins' Booz&co work?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bac-booz_and_co-logo_3436.gif]


Is it supposed to be two words or one? Might be interesting to treat it as one, how would it be pronounced? If you wanted a subtle tilt at 'people' you could look at something with the i's representing a person - relationship with the t representing a relevant concept. The symmetry is nice but as bobby said, take care not to look like a church. Maybe the 'me', as in personal, could be emphasized? Does 'ze' mean anything in German?

Could also look at a far subtler nod to 'time'...dunno, something like the letters casting a shadow starting long and going to short representing the passing of time without alluding to clocks. Might be too fussy. Tracking from loose to very tight in the middle to loose again - acceleration?

Just some random thoughts anyway, take them for what they are. We would get all this sort of stuff up on a wall and start exploring.

I would avoid having 'recruitment agency' as part of the name or mark - its redundant and dull.

ps. that thing with the clip art in your last post is just awful.</div>

How about this. It's essentially a combination of Sharon's and David's ideas:
