  font. I understand the basics of the software but some bits remain blurry. Right
  now, I am wondering on an efficient way to group the few glyphs I have. I do not
  need to build features for a large range of signs; I have in my font 45 conjuncts
  as well as the inde vowels, the vowel signs, the consonants, the half-forms. \r\n\r\nI
  hope it could be simple and straight forward!\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n"

    Latin groups\u2026)\r\nOne group for all Deva glyphs\r\nOne for all the Deva conjuncts\r\nOne
    for all the Deva ligatures\r\nOne group for each of the full consonant forms and
    their derivatives (i.e., one group would include the Ba, the BRa and Bba)\r\nOne
    group for all the full Vattu forms\r\nOne group for all the half forms\r\nAnother
    for all the half Vattu forms (I actually did this group twice\u2026)\r\nThen a
    group for the above the base marks\r\nAnother for the below the base marks\r\n\r\nI
    think that is it! But you have my VOLT project file, so you can take a closer
    look.\r\n"

    are basic groups, but you can have more Glyph Groups based on how big your character
    set is."

    pretty close to Satya''s list. I actually get slightly confused by the document
    Microsoft is providing. Now, everything makes much more sense. Thank you again! '
