body: "This question is a bit of a continuation of [[http://typophile.com/node/117317|this
  thread]]. In short, I am looking for a digitization of the Palatino typeface that
  is close to the original design.\r\n\r\nLooking at [[http://luc.devroye.org/palatino2.html|this]]
  article, \"The original Palatino,\" I do like its liveliness and warmth. It seems
  to have been captured best by [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/|Berthold]]'s digitization
  (see [[http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/pala92.pdf|this PDF]] which has the font
  somewhat incomplete embedded) but that digitization is no longer available. There
  is the [[http://www.linotype.com/57056/palatinolinotype-family.html|Linotype]] version,
  and the [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/pagella|TeX Gyre Pagella]]
  version, and [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/palladio/|URW Palladio]]. Which
  else? And which is closest to Zapf\u2019s original?"

  body: "Oh wow that Berthold one is beautiful! Look at those numerals!\r\n\r\nPalatino
    Nova may very well be the least authentic digitization, if you're looking for
    something that closely resembles the metal type.\r\n\r\nHas anyone digitized Palatino
    with the \"European\" (serifless) descender variants?"

  body: "The [[http://www.linotype.com/615716/Palatinonova-family.html|Palatino Nova]]
    seems as clean and unlively as their other Palatino. It just doesn't seem to have
    the attention to detail that Berthold's has.\r\n\r\nIt makes me wonder: could
    one take Berthold's digitization and continue working on it? Legally, I mean?"

    of Palatino [[http://www.mindspring.com/~fez/palatino/palfaq1.0.txt|here]], but
    curiously it doesn't mention Berthold's version.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, point
    at Bitstream's version of Palatino, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/zapf-calligraphic-801/|Zapf

  body: "IMO the Berthold version suffers from the G\xFCnther Gerhard Lange treatment,
    which is a somewhat exuberant over-emphasis of distinctive features. Viz a lot
    of other BE typefaces. \r\n"
