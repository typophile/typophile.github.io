body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIs there any harm in allowing glyphs to overlap. If, for example,
  I prefer the way 'Qg' looks when they overlap, can I just leave them unkerned, or
  will this cause a white spot where they overlap in some applications?\r\n\r\nThnks.

    you want them to with no white spot issues.

  body: "All script fonts overlap. It's not a problem.\r\nBut... overlapping is no
    problem if all the contours on all the glyphs are in the right order. If they
    are in the wrong order, you may get \"inverse\" overlapping.\r\nAlways use \"Contour
    -> Paths -> Set PS direction\" before generating the OT fonts (or set TT direction
    if you are generating TTF files)."
