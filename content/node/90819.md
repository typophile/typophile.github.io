body: "Hello everybody,\r\nI'm working on a new font and I would like to make few
  non-standard OT features. But I cannot figure out how to make them work:\r\n\r\nThe
  First one should make a special underline or strikethrough effect. It would be most
  probably Stylistic set. I want it to insert a special zero-with \"underline\" character
  I made after every single glyph in my font except for space (and maybe few more
  glyphs). I have made a huge class including all characters but space, and tried
  to make some substitutions, but no success yet. \r\n\r\nThe second feature should
  make quite simple substitution for letter pairs like \"oo\" \"ee\" \"ll\" \"gg\".
  It would not be problem if there wasn't so many combinations to list them all individually.
  Let's suppose two classes are defined: @class01 (o e l g) and @class02 (o.alt e.alt
  l.alt g.alt). I thought something like <em>sub @class1 @class1 by @class1 @class2</em>
  but this kind of substitution does not work.\r\n\r\nThis feature could also work
  in two ways: \r\n- substitute just the same letter pairs like \"o-o\" to \"o-o.alt\"
  (and ignore \"o-g\"), or\r\n- substitute all combinations from defined classes,
  e.g also \"o-g\" to \"o-g.alt\"\r\nI would put this in Calt feature, but it also
  does not work yet :(\r\n\r\nCould anyone help, please?"

  body: "Thank you for the tip! It works :)\r\nThis feature substitutes all the combinations
    (not just two identical characters one after another) which works quite well for
    me. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for the first Feature?\r\nWhat I want is actually
    to change the string like \"abcd\" to \"aXbXcXdX\" only with exception for space
    (or few more characters).\r\n\r\nI have been trying something like sub @All by
    @All X and few more, but still no success...\r\n\r\nAlso is there any command
    which can \"invert\" current class to its opposite? This could help to avoid creating
    very huge classes. For instance my class @All would contain hundreds of glyphs
    while its negative only one or two. This could be very useful."

    (for pseudo-randomization), and they work just fine.\r\n\r\nThe worst that happens

    underlined alternates would require very little time or effort on your part since
    its a purely mechanical procedure which doesn't involve drawing any new glyphs
    -- just copying the old ones and then adding the underline.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    to 99% of problems, and you can propose a single substitution feature with it,
    like calt, salt or clig, supported by the largest panel of softwares. More simple
    will be your font encoding, more easy (and enjoyed) will be your font to be used.'

    Remember that <em>each of the characters</em> in the user's text in your font
    has to be processed. It takes only one step in the feature table to swap a glyph
    for an underlined one, or it takes a dozen steps to coax precisely the right \"underline\"
    character into position.\r\n\r\nSwapping one glyph for another is an extremely
    efficient operation due to the way Opentype feature tables are internally represented.
    One could say it's the cornerstone of the entire features idea."

    confirmed by simply adding random stylistic sets to a font which involve such
    substitutions and noting that they don't work.\r\n\r\nEven in CS3, though, hardcoded
    fi will be rendered as FI regardless of whether this glyph is included in any
    opentype feature. This is because InDesign does some preprocessing before applying
    a font's features. \uFB01 (UFB01) will be converted to either fi (U0066+U0069)
    or FI (U0045+U0049) before any case-related GSUB features are applied to this
