  you can easily attach pictures to particular languages and diacritical marks. We
  welcome your submissions of fine examples of correct accents. Let's help other designers
  to create accents for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and other scripts.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nDiacritics
  project is a free on-line database of knowledge and\r\nexperience - how to design
  correct diacritics (what size, shape and position\r\nan accent should have). Text
  concerning the history, use, languages, and\r\nalso some technical information is
  related to each diacritical mark. The\r\nproject is on-line at http://diacritics.typo.cz.\r\n\r\nEveryone
  is invited to check it. If you would like to edit\r\nthe text, simply Register and
  Login - every page can be edited, corrected or\r\nenhanced with pictures by anyone
