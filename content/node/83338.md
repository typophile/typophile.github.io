  flavor fonts when it makes a PDF, causing less-than-good appearances in some cases.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/72404\r\n\r\nNow
  MS Word SP1 has been announced, but I have not read that this has been improved.
  Info on Word 2010 SP1 is here:\r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/2460049\r\n\r\nI
  am hoping that Microsoft made an undocumented change and fixed this. Can anyone
  say yes or no as to whether this rasterization process has been changed in Word
  2010 SP1?\r\n\r\nThanks."
