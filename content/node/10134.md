    target="_blank">Geometric 415 black</a> is the closest I can find. <BR> <BR>You
    could also look at Avenir Black, or Futura Bold.

  body: CMYK VS RGB, may be the problem for not seeing the images in various browsers..
    <BR><i>&#40; Soo, If those posting requests on Typophile could please make sure
    that their samples are in RGB, rather than in CMYK.. &#41;</i>
