  level. I thought it'd be fun to map the difficulty level to a print-related term.\r\n\r\nThe
  first thought was some form of job title...apprentice being 'easy', for instance.
  Are there job titles that could work (typesetter? pressman?)\r\n\r\nOr...perhaps
  there's other printing terms that would map well to a difficulty level? "

    (easy)\r\nThe Typesetter (medium)\r\nThe Journeyman (hard) \r\n\r\nI was thinking
    of 'The Foreman' for the hard level, but I'm not sure the foreman was actually
    a printer as much as a manager. "

    the canonical order.

    but then I'm left with 3 terms that really are more union-centric than anything
    particularly print-industry related. I thought 'typesetter' was a fun term but
    maybe that's not enough to carry all three as being type-related. "

    of his craft.\r\n\r\n'Course, you could make up some vaguely-canonical line, like
    Typesetter / Linesetter / Pagesetter (char by char / line by line / page by page)."
