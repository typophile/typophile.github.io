body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is a straightforward design, but I'm having trouble because
  my eyes are very unfresh on this project. The logo's theoretically final, but I
  can tweak the kerning if you have suggestions on that.  I'm feeling waffle-y about
  the border - what I'd really like is an embossed border, but we are on a low budget.\r\n\r\nI
  suppose I should tell you: [[http://www.screamsorbet.com|Scream]] is a two-person
  company who'll be selling in SF Bay Area farmer's markets, and then hopefully expanding
  to a brick-and-mortar store and/or restaurant sales.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bizcard_bothsides_6483.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  image suffered a bit in the conversion from CMYK to RGB, but it's about right.  Again,
  letter spacing & the border are the things I'm stuck on, although I welcome any
  thoughts at all.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBeth"

  body: I really like the simplicity of the design and the font choice which seems
    pretty inspired to me. But the overall effect I get is sort of "toy store". Probably
    via the colors which feel like paint instead of "food". Also it feels a bit "accessible/easy"
    rather than "elite/high end". If this was for sale in gas stations you would probably
    be bang-on; but it isn't. It's snobby foodie SF bay - no? ( my peeps! ) And so
    I think a softer more subtle color palette would be way more upscale. What about
    letting one of the puddles run in three rivulets? what about just one wipe of
    cream behind the letters in an arc? Maybe photographed from behind glass. I think
    less space between the a & m would be good. Or looser spacing overall to match
    the a & m. Can this be done in one spot color instead of CMYK? Or two? I guess
    you are not down with the very fancy decorated thing that's still seems to be
    all the rage... ;-) I will be interested to hear what the other folk think.

    a bit. Keep 'scream' all by itself on the front, and then on the back maybe add
    just one puddle."

  body: "I'd vote against the border. It feels to me like it's trying to be formal,
    which goes against the colorfulness, lowercase, puddles, even 3-dness of the logo,
    which says tasty fun. And you want a \"clean\" surface for the melted food. I'd
    take it off, at least on the logo side.\r\n\r\nAll that said, here's an idea out
    of left field: what would happen if you turned the border into a trapezoid so
    that it looked more like a counter surface in perspective on which those puddles
    sit?"

  body: I think Craig is right about the spacing. I like the back very much. I agree
    the upright is better because it is consistent with the sensibility established
    on the front. The italic, less so. If this is CMYK & you are doing 8 up on a sheet
    ( or whatever ) You could make each back color different - just for fun.  What
    is it like with even rounder corners on that box? They must be excited - no?

    situating the web address like that is that the lower end of the 2nd s might read

    fruit they use, their process, etc.\r\n\r\nHere's a start on a matching card for

    If yes, you could loser the puddles. Right now the letters just feel a bit placed
    on top. Sorbet doesn't make me scream, more of a sigh, but I like the idea. ;^)\r\n\r\nThe
    back feels separate from the front. I'd keep the back simple, black type no color

  body: "Thanks for the spacing suggestions, Eben.  And Darrel, I was thinking of
    doing something to add color to the back - perhaps the border?\r\n\r\nAs I said
    in my post, the logo is done - the founders are happy with it, and it strikes
    a balance between elite/high-end and something that families with kids will flock
    to at farmer's markets.   (And something that won't offend the populist sensibilities
    of the founders.)  As far as the colors go - toy store is good.  Every one of
    those colors are actual colors of sorbets these guys have made, so there will
    be a nice moment of brand-strengthening when people see how vivid the natural
    fruit sorbets are (the prickly pear is pretty much 100% M, and the beet-lemon
    is a fabulous deep crimson).\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, if anyone has suggestions on how to
    work with the existing logo to make the business cards better, I'm all ears!  :)"

  body: My feeling is that the new back while quite fun doesn't go with the front
    all that well. It's a different style. The old rounded corner box is a better
    match & it will cost less to print ( no bleed).  I would try dropping your info
    into that & seeing what you get. Another idea would be to take a puddle & use
    that instead of the rounded corner box. Or just use the white. Maybe that's just
    fine...

    the images from a CMYK 300 ppi 10-biz card spread, and so there are some things
