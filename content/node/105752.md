body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been working on my first typeface for the past 2 and a half
  weeks.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to create a type inspired by the Bauhaus letterforms
  but adapted to modern times.\r\n\r\nWith styles good for <strong>Display</strong>
  (\"regular\" and \"bold\") and others good for <strong>Text</strong> (\"book\" and
  \"book bold\").\r\n\r\nI haven't set the kerning yet and there's still plenty of
  work to do, but I wanted your opinion about what I've got so far.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!"

  body: "i like it. there is something that catches my eye, and that\u2019s the pointy
    corner inside the bold /s. I suppose you could make that a bit more round. Also
    the lowercase /a has some kind of weird buckle, where the upper curve joins the
    stem. And you might put the tittle of the /i just a hint higher, so it has either
    the exact same distance to the stem before, or fits the cap height.\r\n\r\nThe
    phrase about sleep is really catchy. May be you should adjust the kerning a bit
    though. Combinations like /p to /t and /t to /o look a bit big.\r\n\r\nbest regards"
