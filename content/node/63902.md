body: "Hi\r\nI write a newsletter and I'm sometimes battling with copy exceeding page
  length. I need a nice way to direct the reader to where they can find the end of
  the article and which column to jump to. I'm wondering if there's a standard dingbat
  and whether the words, such as 'continued on page 2 left column', should be in the
  same font but a point size smaller, or in italics, or if there's any convention
  here. Though not technically appropriate, double guillemets might be nice? Like
  this:\r\n<cite>&#8195;Continued on p.3, right column \xBB</cite>\r\nor with an arrow:\r\n<cite>&#8195;Cont'd
  on p.3, right column &#8594;</cite>\r\n<cite>&#8195;Cont'd on p.3, right column
  &#8658;</cite>\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "Layman's opinion: I'd probably argue for no dingbat necessary; feels redundant
    with \"continued.\" And this isn't about the typography, but are there shorthand
    versions of the story title that could be used instead of the \"column\" directions?
    As a reader I'd find that easier. E.g.:\r\n<em>'Emdash Controversy' continues
    on p. 3</em>"

    front page </em> or similar at the top of the continuation to create a link

    page a simple arrowlike symbol suffices, IMO.\r\nIt looks nice if that arrow (or
    double guillemet, why not?) is set flush right, with some space in front or it.
    Differentiate by use of colour.\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Bert, would you use the same symbol on the continuation line, flush left,
    with no further words? I like the simplicity of this solution provided that I
    can keep the continuation to the top left of the following page. The only thing
    is that right-aligning the symbol after a gap will interrupt the article's sentence
    (and justification pattern).\r\n\r\nI'm using Stag, which has full-height guillemets
    in ss01 which could look nice, especially in a colour.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to
    post some images."

    right in the middle (like #2, but even further left) and then pick it up at the
    same halfway spot on the continuation text.\r\n\r\nKind of like in the text of
    Shakespeare plays, sometimes the character speaking changes but the place in the
    line doesn't start over.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5943.gif]\r\nTypographically
    this might suggest the concept of \"picking up where you left off\" well."

    was spoken right after the previous (almost interrupting the previous player).
    I agree, it is an interesting concept.\r\n\r\nI like the use of a (coloured) triangle
    to imply the text continues and a block to imply the text stops. You could even
    start the continuation with the same triangle if you fear it might not be clear
    where the text starts again."

    be clear. "

    make the cut after a full sentence. With some fiddling this can be done most of

    fine. I find that offsetting it to the left, so it stands outside of the textcolumn,

  body: Perhaps because I am more of a writer than a typographer, I have to say I
    find it strange and disturbing that the text would be changed in these ways (changing
    paragraph breaks, for example) to make the fit better. I've seen this kind of
    recommendation on Typophile before, such as changing out a synonym for a word
    to improve the rag. Makes me cringe! Shouldn't the form have to adapt to the content
    rather than the other way around?

    edition of a Nobel prize, for example.\r\n\r\nBut if it is, let\u2019s say, a
    not so important note in a local newspaper, I don\u2019t see a problem about changing
    a bit the content (advise: first get a permission from the author or the editor
    and say why you want that change)."

  body: "FWIW, in some newspapers it's actually the practice to have jumps occur in
    the middle of a sentence to show the break more clearly. I remember being disgusted
    with the idea at first, but from reading text like this I have found that it's
    actually not that bad. Counter-intuitively, it's almost useful for not disrupting
    the reading flow, as jumping between pages at the end of a sentence can sometimes
    make it a bit hard to recall what the preceding sentence was about (while that
    first bit of a sentence hanging in your mind seems to persevere).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    getting slightly further afield, I have found the single most helpful typographic
    device for jumps to be a combination of a keyword in the beginning of the jump,
    e.g. \"See <strong>Religion</strong> on page 3,\" and a large, bold intro in the
    jumped article's headline, e.g. \"<strong>RELIGION:</strong> A crisis of faith.\"
    This makes it far easier for the reader to pick up the article after turning the
    page."
