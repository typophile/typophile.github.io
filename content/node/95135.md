  the italics, I'm not sure about it. Thanks for you feedback.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SUBA_TEST_6483.jpg]"

    such extreme weights, especially in a curvy monoweight.\r\n\r\nSome crits:\r\n-
    I would give one of the diagonals of the \"x\" some curling (especially looking
    at the \"z\").\r\n- The sharp turns when diagonals meet look unhappy. I think
    it would be much better to have the diagonals (even if they're curved) meet sharply.\r\n-
    I think some parts of some letters in the Bold need more contrast.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Pretty hard to get the same \u201Cwavy-cirviness\u201D in ultra thin weight
    but I think it can be done. With this image I can\u2019t see if you have the same
    terminal. It's also hard to interpolate from an ultra thin to an ultra, I strongly
    recommend to draw a regular weight to interpolate from thin to regular and regular
    to ultra. Keep going."

  body: "where is the wavy-curviness coming from in the the fatter weight?  I dont't
    see any of that in the thin weight.  To me they look like two different fonts,
    not two different weights of the same font.\r\n\r\nTo be clear I like both of
    them. Just not sure if they connect with eachother.  One looks almost like it
    was done with a brush, while the other doesn't have anything brushy about it at
    all."

  body: I understand, I think the way things go with the fatter weight are different
    for what the thinner are proposing. Maybe a change into the brushy on the black
    may things seems more alike.

    then I was talkin to some friend, and she told me to do that way. Like a Male
    and a Female version of that. Then I can keep going with two almost same structure
    but in different ways of design.\r\nWell, I think I will need to do a few changes
    in order to keep this thinking.\r\n\r\nPlease comment. \r\nHope you liked.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SUBA_F_4613.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SUBA_M_5287.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SUBA_1_3771.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SUBA_2_6078.jpg]"

  body: Personally, I don't like where it's going with the Thin. Maybe it's true that
    the Bold and the Thin from the first post represent similar, but slightly different
    font, but they're both very pleasant. Now it seems like you're trying to fit the
    Thin into the Bold curves by force and it isn't doing much good for the font.

    in the bold \"male\" version is too wide. In the \"female\" version it looks just

    you to keep going with it, it's a lovely design :)
