  anyone have any helpful suggestions? Thanks

  body: "Most monospaced fonts have their roots in the era of typewriters. Hence,
    I always find it a bit odd to find Courier & co. in a context completely different
    from what was possible with a typewriter; let\u2019s say, in 72p display setting.
    Or justified. Or \u2018beautifully\u2019 kerned.\r\nSame for leading. Some combinations
    of size and ledaing just scream \u2018pomo\u2019!\r\nIt depends. Maybe you want
    to show an image?"

  body: "I understand what you mean, and I agree to a certain extent.\r\nHowever almost
    all digital type is 'pomo'. Think of all the digital  'revivals' that also contain
    '@' etc. It is as 'pomo' as Disneyland.\r\nMonospace is not just used for typewriters,
    as I'm sure you know, it can be used for tabular systems too.\r\n\r\nI think that
    monospace type is fair game.\r\n\r\nLeading?\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "<cite>I think that monospace type is fair game.</cite>\r\nYes, I fully agree
    with that. And you\u2019re right about the Didone email adresses. :\xB0) Still,
    I personally find it harder to stifle that \u2018pomo!\u2019-feeling with deracinated
    monospacers. But back to topic:\r\n<cite>Leading?</cite>\r\nWhat do you wanna
    hear? Percentage values? What typeface, line lenght, content, media? Monospace
    fonts in general\u2014inherently\u2014tend to form vertical columns, you\u2019re
    certainly aware of that. So, maybe you want to increase the leading a bit to countersteer
    that phenomenon, if undesired."

  body: "The leading you use should be the result in part of line length, ascender
    height, descender height & x-height. There isn't a formula but a good place to
    start might be 1.20 of the pt size of the type. The longer the line of text the
    more pressure there is to add space to the interlinear space.\r\n\r\nSome good
    places to look for more info are 'The Elements of Typographic Style' by Robert
    Bringhurst, and maybe search Typophile via google. For instance : http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20Leading
    There have been some excellent threads on this subject here as I recall. \r\n\r\nLine
    space for a mono will be trickier to do in the sense that a mono is always going
    to look more uneven to the eye with the dense m and the wide i and so on - which
    is distracting. But the principles are the same as for a non-mono as far as I
    can tell. \r\n\r\nUltimately - trust your eyes no matter what I ( or anyone )
    says."

  body: "I would think that monospace type would generally require more leading than
    proportional spaced type. The reason would be that monospaced letterspacing feels
    more open and I would want to maintain a horizontal feel to a line so that rivers
    would not be so prominant. How much more? Only your eyes can tell.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "The typeface I was using was Monospace Swiss 821 BT, at quite short line
    lengths.\r\nI only really asked because the usual iterative process had failed;
    having stared at the type for sometime I started to doubt my preferences.\r\nIncreased
    leading definitely helped.\r\n\r\nFlorian I have images of you suffering Pomo
    type left, right and centre. I'm not so dissimilar myself! The worst is bitmapped
    Courier, blown up large, with all the imperfect impressions copied for 'typewriter
    effect'.\r\n\r\nThank you"
