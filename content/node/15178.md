body: "When updating Postscript Type 1 fonts to Unicode (Adobe fonts only, of course),
  I frequently have to come up with the Unicode index for a character. For example,
  we may have a character named \u201CVcaron\u201D in our Type 1 font. If Vcaron is
  already a precomposed Unicode character, I need the number. If not, I just add it
  to the ccmp feature.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a cheap (free would be nice) tool that
  lets one enter individual characters & then tells you if a precomposed character
  exists (in 4.1.0). SC Unipad does this, but it is pretty pricey for just this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "I just use a textfile of character names for this and grep for the character
    I want to know about. In the Vcaron example, I'd say\r\n<code> \r\ngrep V.WITH.CARON
    unicode_nameslist.txt\r\n</code> \r\nwhich would give me no result, but, say,\r\n<code>
    \r\ngrep H.WITH.CARON unicode_nameslist.txt\r\n</code> \r\nwould give me\r\n<code>
    \r\n021E    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H WITH CARON\r\n021F    LATIN SMALL LETTER H
    WITH CARON\r\n</code> \r\nI can of course also grep for \"CARON\" for a list of
    all precomposed characters involving carons, and all other sorts of things. I
    really see no need for a separate program to do this.\r\n"
