  body: 'An interesting <a href="http://www.uefap.co.uk/reading/exercise/texts/sony.htm">
    article</a> about Sony: <BR> <BR><i>&#34;We kept our old corporate name for some
    time after we began putting the Sony logotype on our products. For our first product
    logo, we used a tall, thin sloping initial letter inside a square box, but I soon
    realized that the best way to get name recognition would be to make the name as
    legible and simple as possible, so we moved to the more traditional and simple
    capital letters that remain today. The name itself is the logo.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;On
    our thirty-fifth anniversary, we thought we should consider revising our trademark.
    Styles and fashions were changing in clothing, in product design, and in virtually
    everything, so we thought that perhaps we should consider changing the style of
    the letters of our name. We held an international competition, and we received
    hundreds of suggestions, along with hundreds of pleas from our dealers not to
    change. After reviewing all the suggestions, we decided not to make any changes.
    S O N Y still looked very good to us, and we decided, as they say today, that
    there was no point in fixing something that was far from broken.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;From

    in that contest. Mind you, those were the pre-Mac times and getting to the stage
    of comps that were good enough to send to Tokyo, involved a lot of hard work with
    rotring pens, compasses, repro camera&#39;s, colorproofs, etcetera. <BR>Image
    the consternation Sony caused among the participants when they decided to retain
    the old logo. I have never done a contest ever since...'

  body: Zapata light is not an exact match, but reminds a little bit the sony letters
    &#40;but more extended&#41;.
