  think it's called \"TYPE ....\" but as you can imagine that font name is hard to
  find with Google.\r\n\r\nFirst one who names the font, gets lots of gratitude from
  Maastricht, the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nthanks, Bart\r\n\r\n"

    that website, so it actually displays a font in the user's computer...I would
    say Trebuchet if it was not that condensed"
