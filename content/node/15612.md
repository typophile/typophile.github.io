  \"Breaking Away\".\r\n\r\nI've come close with FF QType Compressed Bold, but it's
  still not quite right. Anyone else have a suggestion?\r\n\r\nAlso need some help
  with another typeface that I'd like to i.d.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance all!"

    target=\"new\">Banque Gothique Extra Condensed</a> pretty close. I can see it's
    more closed, but so far it was the best match I found.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Also think about the technique they used on your second sample. It was probably
