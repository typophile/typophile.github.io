body: "In a paper published October 2012, Kimihiro Nakamura, Wen-Jui Kuo, Felipe Pegado,
  Laurent Cohen, Ovid J. L. Tzeng, and Stanislas Dehaene hypothesize \u201Cthat, across
  all different cultures, the mature reading network comprises both a visual shape
  analysis system and a motor gesture decoding system.\u201D They suggest that \u201Cthis
  extended network is universal and that only its amount of activation is modulated
  according to the variable processing demands of writing systems. A motor memory
  for writing [\u2026] is known to play a general role in literacy acquisition in
  alphabetic literacy acquisition. Such gestural coding during reading may rely on
  a fast neural pathway [\u2026] that automatically recovers the intended motor gestures
  underlying visually perceived handwritten traces [\u2026].\r\n\r\nThe paper is titled
  \u201CUniversal brain systems for recognizing word shapes and handwriting gestures
  during reading,\u201D See: www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1217749109\r\n\r\n\u201C[O]our
  results support the proposal that the expert reading network universally comprises
  two distinct pathways: an orthographic decoding system in the VWFA (reading by eye)
  and a kinesthetic gesture code system in Exner\u2019s area (reading by hand). [\u2026]
  Our view predicts that the gesture code of writing should play a much greater role
  in reading when the expert VWFA system is not fully developed, either in early stages
  of reading acquisition or in the earlier ages of the literate human history when
  handwriting was used as a dominant medium for writing. Indeed, recent developmental
  data show that reading acquisition is facilitated when young children are taught
  to write or finger-trace the letter shapes compared with classical grapho-phonemic
  teaching without a haptic component. Conversely, fMRI of normal and dyslexic children
  also suggests that reading difficulties lead to a greater reliance on the left Exner\u2019s
  area, suggesting partial compensation through the gesture system.\r\n\r\n\u201COur
  results further suggest that a large part of the known cultural variations in the
  cerebral reading network may represent merely a differential weighting of the universal
  visual and gestural coding systems. Some writing systems, such as Chinese, Japanese,
  or Tamil, remain strongly centered on a realistic depiction of handwriting strokes,
  whereas others, including the Roman alphabet, are stylized to the point of using
  unique shapes for printed letters that even expert literates can no longer write
  (e.g., the shape of a printed letter g). We suggest that the former systems more
  systematically engage the gestural reading system [\u2026]. [\u2026] In the present
  study, this region, although contributing to both cultures, was more strongly engaged
  by moving than by static words in Chinese than in French participants, possibly
  because motor memory clearly plays a key role in memorizing the thousands of characters
  needed for fluent Chinese reading. Conversely, the VWFA, although universally involved
  in reading, is more activated in English than in Italian, presumably because of
  the greater number of graphemes needed in a nontransparent compared with a transparent
  alphabetic language.\r\n\r\n[\u2026]\r\n\r\n[A]t a [\u2026] macroscopic level, we
  propose that cultural variability lies primarily in the different emphasis that
  distinct writing systems place on the visual and gestural pathways, thus resulting
  in modulations of the spatial extent and amplitude of brain activity within culturally
  universal brain circuits.\""

    of course, that over the long period in which, as Bringhurst notes, everyone who
    was a reader was also a writer, the reading process would have harnessed a motor
    gesture decoding system. A lot of interesting questions arise from this, especially
    with regard to the variable balance of visual and gestural pathways in the context
    changing text cultures. Are we, for instance, in the midst of a change in that
    balance due to the relative infrequency of handwriting and its secondary role
    in text creation in our culture?"

  body: "Thanks Peter.\r\n\r\nOne question in regard to this statement: <cite>Indeed,
    recent developmental data show that reading acquisition is facilitated when young
    children are taught to write or finger-trace the letter shapes compared with classical
    grapho-phonemic teaching without a haptic component.</cite>\r\n\r\nWould the haptic
    component also be enhanced by letting children learn to write (i\u2019m speaking
    of Latin languages/scripts now) their script with a broad-nibbed pen to better
    distinguish the pattern of letters? Nowadays they have to write their letters
    (very close to printed letters with almost no handwritten origin) with ballpoint
    pens showing no stroke contrasts, resulting in writing and reading difficulties.\r\nOr
    am i moving too far from the above thesis?"

    quite right, but the passage quoted did make that claim in essence: because Caslon
    or Times Roman is established as the normative form of the Latin alphabet, people
    don't get the assistance in learning it from the experience of forming the letters
    when writing them.\r\n\r\nSo, I suppose this means that Futura is more readable
    than Times Roman."

    the contexts of the Latin alphabet frequency of exposure to Times/Caslon nullifies
    the brains ability to form a connection between the processes of reading and writing
    because the average person\u2019s handwriting doesn\u2019t have serifs?\r\n\r\nIf
    that were true, could I not point to the subtle differences between a Chinese
    character rendered by brush strokes compared to something mechanical, and make
    the same argument?"

    reading more of the excerpt, the haptic component is mostly important as a substitute
    for the dyslexic, not as a primary requisite."

  body: "Gestural does not require thick-and-thin drawing.  A line can have a gesture
    and be of one weight.  Matisse has demonstrated this in some of his work.\r\nMost
    handwriting in modern times is written with a tool that is not broadnibbed.  True,
    weight of pressure and speed of stroke can make a line fade to some degree, even
    with a rapidograph.\r\nIf a child learning to write, traces the pathways of letterforms,
    it makes sense that this can take part in the imprinting of the form as well as
    the visual learning.  I have a hard time seeing how this would vary with culture--Even
    if a given culture is more prone to using a brush instead of a ballpoint pen.
    It would seem that whatever makes a cultural variance is a function of the typical
    tool mixed with the script."
