  body: "I like Munn's work but that spacing is atrocious. I think he got hold of
    a poorly kerned version or attempted himself and was a little tipsy that day.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Booman Swash, recommend the OpenType version of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bookman_std_medium_italic/\">ITC
    Bookman</a> which comes with the regular and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bookman_std_medium_italic/?acs_ss=8&sample_text=See%20swashes%20below.\">swash
    caps</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bookman_std_medium_italic/?acs_ss=6&sample_text=See%20alts%20below.\">other
    alternates</a> in one font."

    remember that the original, much tastier pre-ITC version of <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000085\">Bookman
    Swash</a> also has been digitized by [[Jason Walcott]]."
