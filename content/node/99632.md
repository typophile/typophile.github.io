  body: "My first thought was Univers too, but enough details don\u2019t match that
    I held off. Notice the cross-bar on the |A| is significantly thinner here and
    there is more variation in stroke weight on the|N| in the sample compared to Univers
    86."

  body: "Totally agree with Gr\xE4fenberg. It smells \"Univers\" but, as perfectly
    spotted, some details remain off. But, they could have been the result of some
    manipulation: slanting, artificially emboldening, edition... As it's for a logo
    (Osram Sylvania), it would not be surprising it could have been the result of
    some customization based on Univers. BTW, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-next/|Univers
    Next Extra Black]] is bit closer though not matching."
