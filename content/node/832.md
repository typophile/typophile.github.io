    prof. said, &#34;I don&#39;t like that. I have an idea. Give it to me and I&#39;ll
    do it for you.&#34; It&#39;s okay to give verbal descriptions or even sketches
    to illustrate, but to fully execute the idea kind of crosses the line between
    teaching and doing. To be honest, it made me feel like &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    when I came in here and saw that, then saw you and Tiff raving over it, I thought,
    &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s not mine anymore, it&#39;s Christos&#39;.&#34;
    Instead of giving me a spark of an idea to go out and try to make it better, it&#39;s
    made me not want to touch it anymore. I know other people can do it better, but
    you should be able to tell from my first post that I really wanted to do this
    myself, and just get input from others to guide me along, not to have other people
    take my stuff and do it for me. I know a lot of you guys are art school crit hardened,

  body: Colin, what Chris did was offer you a sketch.  Sure he probably drew it in
    illustrator and made it look nice, but it&#39;s still no different than a rough
    sketch made on paper. <BR> <BR>So he didn&#39;t just write down a few ideas, big
    deal, it probably wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve been very easy to explain, so he did the
    next best thing. <BR> <BR>The original idea, the one Chris&#39; version is based
    on is still yours.  For what he did to make you feel like crap is, IMO, a stupid
    response.  You can still choose to incorporate his ideas or disregard them because
    all he gave you was a sketch.  A well rendered sketch, but a sketch nonetheless.
    <BR> <BR>I can only speak for myself, but I believe the reason that Tiffany and
    I like it was because it is still taking the spirit of the original design while
    giving it a new direction, something that hasn&#39;t really been done yet.  Every
    sample so far has looked almost exactly the same with just simple changes, whereas
    Chris&#39; changes were radical compared to the design as a whole yet still keeping
    the same spirit. <BR> <BR>Chris was making his suggestion just like everyone else,
    only his was visual and not written.  If you don&#39;t want suggestions, no matter
    how they&#39;re made or what their content, you should not ask for help. <BR>
    <BR>You can still do the design yourself.  What Chris gave you is input on possible
    ways to execute it.  He only &#34;did it for you&#34; if you decide to use his
    version lock, stock, and barrel. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry for the confusion, I thought
    tiffany had submitted ideas, my error. <BR> <BR>And for the record, yes, my teachers
    have said they didn&#39;t like my stuff and have given me completely new ideas.  I
    usually just ignored them and did my own thing anyway.

  body: And don&#39;t forget the best design is a usually a group effort. <BR> <BR>I
    understand taking a lot of ownership in something, working hard at it, really
    coming up with something and then fealing a little defeated in the end with the
    Art Director tweaks a few things and, when all said and done, &#42;does&#42; improve
    the final piece. <BR> <BR>But realize that&#39;s what art directors &#40;and design
    colleagues&#41; do. I think you could take any logo posted in here Colin and honestly
    and proudly say it is yours. You came up with the concept, you slaved over it,
    and, as always, a few outside perspectives were able to tweak it a bit and &#39;take
    it over the top&#39;. <BR> <BR>The best design firm I ever worked in was one where
    EVERYTHING was group design. In the end, it made for easier, faster work, less
    egos, and ultimately, happier clients and designers. <BR> <BR>So, I guess I&#39;d
    say beggers shouldn&#39;t be choosers. When you post in a forum for a critique,

    a lot of the character of the logo, which is supposed to be somewhat celtic looking.
    I assume it&#39;d be better to take away from the H rather than add to the C,
    but at this point I feel it&#39;s at the bare minimum of what I want. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, I&#39;ll let it sit for a while again. For now, how am I doing with
    the B

    of adding a new drawing point. The way it is, a new point is necessary indeed.
    <BR>B- Keep it. It&#39;s needed. <BR> <BR>Regarding your monogram. Maybe you could
    try narrowing the &#34;h&#34; or widening the &#34;c&#34; &#40;or both&#41;?'

  body: After I posted this, I decided to widen the C, open the counter to the H a
    bit, and open the spacing a bit. Hopefully this will fix the issue of the dominant
    H that Hrant brought up. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the help so far.
