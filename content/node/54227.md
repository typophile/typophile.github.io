body: "Hello. for my language (Slovene), I need the character c with caron. Many fonts
  don't have it, but do have both `c' and `caron'.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to
  get my accented character? Is there a way to just compose the two (in InDesign?)
  or is it better to add it to the font? \r\n\r\nI've had good results with FontForge
  but would still like to clarify some issues. With some fonts, I've seen the empty
  space for the glyphs (ccaron, Ccaron) and it was easy to add them. But with others,
  those glyphs weren't defined. When I told FontForge to generate fonts (otf), they
  appeared. Now I'd like to know if this is the correct procedure and whether the
  quality is compromised in the process.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions,\r\n\r\nAndrej."

  body: "There is no simple answer. Some layout engines have a \"floating accent\"
    routine, but as far as I know, InDesign isn't one of them. Maybe an ID expert
    will chime in here.\r\n\r\nThe other way is to add the character to the font,
    wich constitutes \"modifying\" the font. There are both legal and technical matters
    with this. \r\n\r\nTo the legal issue: I believe the laws in the EU are different
    than the States, and I believe I've seen posts that stated some European countries
    have laws which supercede the foundry EULA in some situations. I'm not a lawyer,
    and have no idea. Moreover, several foundries (including Adobe) allow modifying
    fonts for this purpose, for your own use.\r\n\r\nTechnically, making up Ccaron
    and ccaron is easy. They are both precomposed characters in Unicode (in Latin
    Extended A), so there is no need to use any special OpenType feature such as ccmp
    or mark. I would simply copy and paste the C,c in the correct spots, then copy
    the caron and paste it over the c. If the caps have flatter accents than the lower
    case, a caron is usually the same a horizontally and vertically flipped circumflex,
    so the circumflex from a any cap letter can be copied & used after the double-flip.
    (If that isn't to your taste, modify as you want.) Center the accents over the
    C,c as desired, and write off the font. If you want/need to add the Ccaron/ccaron
    to the kerning, that is a separate step, and you will have to understand how the
    kerning in the font is presently constituted.\r\n\r\nIf you use type a lot, for
    your own projects, understanding how to make this simple kind of modification
    is worth the time it takes to learn the ins and outs. The hardest part will probably
    be dealing with existing class kerning and OT features. Even if InDesign has a
    floating accent feature (or comes out with one in a future release), you will
    run across situations where you have to modify the font -- for example, any accent
    over a lower-case \"h\" that has to center on the stem will defeat a simple \"floating
    accent\" routine.\r\n\r\nGood luck to you"
