    are coded using named entities. How did you type them in -- did you just keyboard
    them directly &#40;you can do that in Windows, right?&#41; or did you provide
    the named entity? Perhaps the numerical entity would work more consistently across

    else please explain to me why MacRoman and 1252 include Lslash, lslash, Scaron,

    OS X can access them&#41;. I think the reason they&#39;re in MacRoman is a Fontographer
    thing. When you select MacRoman as the character set, Fontographer designates
    many of the first 16 character slots to characters that are part of the Windows
    1252 character set. I&#39;ve always assumed this was to make it easier to do font
    development for Mac and Windows at the same time. <BR> <BR>As to why they were
