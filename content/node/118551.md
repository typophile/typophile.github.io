  like D&G and Armani, who can certainly afford custom fonts, stick with Google fonts?\r\n\r\nIs
  Lato really the font that comes to your mind for a bio of Lionel Messi (D&G site)?"

  body: "From personal experience, I've run into clients while designing websites
    that specifically request certain Google fonts. They can afford better, but for
    whatever reason, they regard Google fonts as the \"in\" thing, the latest in technology
    or something they decided upon because they were able to easily research it themselves.\r\n\r\nI've
    also run into situations where previous designers (both contract and in-house)
    have chosen free fonts for the simple reason that they're easy and don't involve
    the hassle of an extra client charge or running a purchase order though their
    company's fiscal people. Or maybe they tried a free font at first as sort of a
    place holder, then decided they actually liked it."

  body: Thanks both for your reply. Makes sense Thylacine, it doesn't seem like it's
    all very thoughtful.

    on users machines, they are almost like web safe fonts, in terms of perf.  '

  body: "Yes, performance is a point, Si_Daniels. But I'd guess premium brands would
    have the means to invest in some well crafted (web)fonts.\r\n\r\nOften, among
    hotels and resorts, for instance, Google fonts have become the go-to solution.
    Don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing. Most people won't notice a big difference
    anyway."

    Custom fonts may not be a financial problem for a big company, but in the company's
    bid specifications they may have given a tight timeline.\r\n\r\nPlus I could imagine
    web designers thinking, \"If we spend time and money on a new font and the company
    doesn't like it, then we get blamed. Safer to use an existing font.\""

    how to pass them along to clients.\r\n(or, for the less honest ones, the fact
    that pirated webfonts are much more likely to be exposed as such than non web
    ones)"

    in print you can do what you like, but on the web... you are best off with graphic
    images or a font distant from your id.
