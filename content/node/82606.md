  body: "My guess is this was drawn lettering, because of the way the baseline drifts
    down on \"no touch\". The script resembles some from signDNA, so possibly the
    lettering was by one of their artists. It's possible the smaller wording is one
    of their fonts, because the s's look identical, when they maybe shouldn't be (to
    me a sign of font use).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
