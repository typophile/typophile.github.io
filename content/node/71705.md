body: I apologize if this has been posted before, but I tried the advanced search
  and came up empty.  I'm searching for the specific typeface used in the Adobe CS
  icons.  With CS5 I know they kind of modified their icon set, but for the most part
  I believe it's been the same characters from CS3-CS5.  I've read elsewhere that
  it's Myriad Pro Bold, but I know it's definitely not, unless they did some manual
  reworking of each individual character.  If anybody could shed some light on this
  I'd greatly appreciate it.
