  body: "I spent a fair amount of time hunting for this and that R is not to be found
    (by me, at least). All I can suppose is that maybe the R was tweaked, or else
    it's a font from a site I didn't search, or I flat missed it where I looked (MyFonts
    and my Sans Guide). [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/agenda_1/?&sample_text=HONDUR|Agenda
    Medium]] was sort of close, but the R was not elongated enough, and the leg doesn't
    curve into the bowl. [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sans/sans_demi.html|Foundry
    Sans]] seemed to have the leg connection, but was still not elongated enough.\r\n\r\nI'm
    stumped.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Are you guys sure this is a [professional] font? The width proportions are
    weird, the straight-to-curve transitions in the "U" and "D" seem bumpy, the "N"
    looks too dark, and the "O" is a circle. Just sayin'.
