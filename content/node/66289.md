  keep running into a deadend. I recognize the font , and I'm sure it's a common one
  , but still no luck.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe Bolt , or at least a some sort
  of variant as what's usually available on the free sites. \r\n\r\nHas anyone more
  familiar with fonts ever ran across this one?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cop1_6440.jpg]"
