  <BR>What I didn&#39;t realise in the beginning , due to vague job descriptions,

  be used on screen&#41;. <BR> <BR>And, since that&#39;s something I know almost nothing
  about I&#39;m asking this: <BR> <BR>Can I somehow &#34;postscript hint&#34; the
  font, open it in Fontlab, and then  convert the settings to truetype hinting? With
  a good result? <BR> <BR>Or shoudl I just try to auto-tt-hint it? <BR> <BR>Or get

  body: It looks like you&#39;re working blind here.  <BR> <BR>One suggestion is if
    you&#39;ve already hinted the PostScript fonts get hold of a Windows NT4 machine
    and use its Type1 installer to convert the font &#40;including hints&#41; to TrueType
    - this used to give the best &#40;free&#41; results. The converter pre-dates ClearType
    so won&#39;t give good results in this is the target.  <BR> <BR>

    do Autoreplacing.  <BR>2. Refine your Type 1 hints manually.  <BR>3. Go to Font
    Info and do Auto Zones and Auto Stems.  <BR>4. Refine your stems settings.  <BR>5.
    Convert the outlines to TrueType, the contour direction to TrueType and hints
    to TT instructions.  <BR>6. Review the results in the TrueType Hinting window.
    Check the TrueType stems settings, esp. the thresholds where the stems turn from
    one pixel to two pixels etc.  <BR>7. Refine the hinting manually if needed.  <BR>
    <BR>This should give you the quickest results. Note that due to a bug in FontLab
    4.6 for Mac, step 6 cannot be easily completed so you may want to use the Windows
    version.  <BR> <BR>Refer to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/activity/hinting/"

    target="_blank">http://www.freetype.org/pipermail/devel/2003-January/008759.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>With Freetype the devs may have turned off support for hinting to avoid
    the documented Apple patent issues. You might want to ask Graham Asher, the guy
    who posted the linked message if he has any details about if Symbian uses hinting
    and or the ClearType like sub-pixel rendering supported by Freetype. This should
    give you some background to the rendering environment.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t know much about Symbian, and it may be something else entirely.
    It&#39;s a shame the client can&#39;t reveal more of the technical details.

  body: In TrueType and TrueType-based fonts, a UPM size that is power of two &#40;1024,
    2048, 4096 etc.&#41; gives microscopic performance gain when rasterizing, as opposed
    to 1000 or 2000. This performance gain was minimally noticable on computers with
    a 8 MHz clock, but certainly not anymore with a 800 or 1600 MHz clock.  <BR> <BR>The
    TrueType specification &#42;always&#42; allowed the use of any UPM from the range
    0-16384, including 2048, 1000 and any other. 2048 was Microsoft&#39;s choice in
    their own fonts, while 1000 was the UPM size for Type 1 fonts. Since currently
    most fonts &#40;Type 1, OpenType PS, TrueType/OpenType TT&#41; are produced from
    the same source, it doesn&#39;t make sense whatsoever to scale the glyphs by 204.8
    % &#40;from 1000 to 2048&#41; because it introduces a lot of trouble and rounding
    errors.  <BR> <BR>I guess it will still take a LOT of typing to get the &#34;2048
    myth&#34; from people&#39;s heads.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam <BR>

  body: I&#39;ll just add that the available evidence is that this performance gain
    was related to &#34;bit-shifting&#34; operations specific to the 68000 series
    of CPUs. <BR> <BR>Microsoft suspects that it is still relevant, but have been
    unable to provide any evidence for this viewpoint that I have seen. However, they
    make it a requirement for fonts being bundled with Windows or Microsoft applications.
    <BR> <BR>If one &#42;was&#42; going to scale the font up from 1000 units, and
    didn&#39;t have to worry about compatibility between 1000-unit and 2048-unit versions,
    I&#39;d suggest scaling it by 2x and then setting the em-square to 2048. <BR>
