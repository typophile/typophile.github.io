    to = install a small executable file on my system. I have a download manager =
    that intercepted it. Since I then have the option to install or not, I = didn&#39;t!
    I don&#39;t know what the file does, but any site that tries to do = that is not
    totally ethical! <BR> <BR> I sent them an email asking what they thought they
    were doing. If I = get a reply, I&#39;ll try to let you know what they said &#40;if
    my old-timers = disease doesn&#39;t make me forget to do it!&#41; <BR> <BR> ;-Diane

    and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American = public. - Theodore Roosevelt'
