<p>I think the spam message a the end of the thread is hilarious, but let&rsquo;s not talk about that -</p>
<p>The question was asked: 
<cite>Has there ever been a font that has been marketed aggressively to the mainstream? That is, not only to the niche market of typographers and print shops, but to the public at large? With TV commercials and the like?</cite></p>
<p>Can we get an answer?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Microsoft Core Web TrueType Fonts were “aggressively marketed” —i.e. bundled with Microsoft products, free. That is why Comic Sans has become a meme, and Impact too, LOLcats style.</p>
<p>It might also be said that Adobe products such as Illustrator and Photoshop are not really graphics niche products—Adobe claimed to have increased the number of graphic artists x25 (in Pamela Pfiffner’s book)—and those products came on CD with a bunch of free fonts.</p>

I think the Microsoft example would be the direction that kind of &ldquo;aggressive marketing&rdquo; of fonts would have to come from. I don&rsquo;t imagine a type distributor or major foundry would be putting that kind of energy and resources into promoting a specific font or group of fonts other than the obvious move of pushing their best sellers to the front.</p>
<p>What I do see a more of these days is really, really deep discounts, which is kind of the opposite. A race to the bottom.</p>

<p>My guess is that most folks who purchase fonts are professionals (graphic designers, etc) so TV advertising wouldn&rsquo;t make sense. Targeted advertising in design magazines and websites would be more logical, and maybe some web ads at popular computer sites.</p>
<p>Google Fonts might be an exception, but I don&rsquo;t recall seeing ads for them.</p>
<p>I think most folks would regard fonts bundled with an application as a bonus, not the main reason to purchase an application.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would have interpreted the question as being &ldquo;was there ever a <em>typeface</em> that was aggressively marketed&rdquo;&hellip; and so the bundling of True Type fonts with either the Macintosh OS or with Microsoft Windows would not een have entered my mind.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing TV commercials for Helvetica or Times Roman, and so I would say that the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even though one could consider bundling Arial as aggressively marketing the typeface as well as the font, and then there are all the Google fonts, or the Gandhi font family as another example.</p>
<p>But a case where the general public has been approached with a view to making money off the typeface afterwards&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think of one.</p>
<p>But then, I may not be recognizing all the possible forms that the marketing of a typeface might take. (I know I haven&rsquo;t seen ads for Perpetua in TIME or LIFE or Newsweek either&hellip; but I may be missing things far more subtle.)</p>
<p>Since before the era of computers, ordinary people in their homes didn&rsquo;t have phototypesetters or even Selectric Composers, the idea of marketing a typeface to the general public, as I envisage it, would be to create a demand for published materials in that typeface, so as to encourage its sales to the usual suspects.</p>
<p>But that leads to a different tangent: Prestige Elite and Courier are typefaces too, and IBM marketed its <em>typewriters</em> broadly enough at times that they could be said to be addressing the general public. Would that count?</p>

<p>Marketing:
Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.</p>
<p>It’s about value, not income. Therefore bundling is marketing—as long as it’s not perceived as spamming (although that could be construed as negative value, which is still value). Certainly, Comic Sans has acquired enough value to be notorious.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That&rsquo;s how it works, though, you need to judge how the media value news stories and tailor your marketing accordingly. The person who co-ordinated the diving operation was acting out of interest and curiosity, definitely, but it will also help his company sell more copies of the typeface I&rsquo;m sure, whether through direct clickthroughs or through raising awareness of its existence.</p>
<p>A lot of marketing works this way. The actual story sold to newspapers is rarely the &ldquo;story&rdquo; the marketers want out, which is inevitably &ldquo;here&rsquo;s our new product, please buy it&rdquo;. (A press release written that way, unless the product is exceptionally innovative, will rarely result in more than specialist press coverage.) Instead, the story is modelled to the specifications the media wants, to maximise exposure, and the fallout from that (if correctly designed) will result in increased exposure for the client as well. New York Times writer Rob Walker calls this sort of strategy &ldquo;murketing&rdquo; – using indirect stories of no obvious connection a specific product to eventually sell it, being dark and murky about the actual marketing intentions.</p>
<p>Here in Sweden, now-defunct PR agency Studio Total was infamous for this sort of thing. They&rsquo;d even routinely create fake products and blogs and music releases and whatnot to build up momentum, only to eventually be revealed as something else entirely. I&rsquo;m not saying font makers work this way, often the story is genuine, but their marketing efforts can work using the same underlying mechanism.</p>

<p>In that universe, where Microsoft Bob became so successful as to become the standard face of Windows, presumably the people working on Linux would have just given up trying to compete with that - and Linux would have remained a niche operating systems for serious computer enthusiasts, not even trying (i.e. with Ubuntu) to have larger mass appeal.</p>

<p>The story begins with Richard Stallman, an idealistic computer programmer. He worked on TECO, the original Emacs at MIT, and the operating system built around the language LISP used by the Symbolics computers. He had a strong belief that access to computer programs should not be restricted by copyright or technical means.</p>
<p>He created, among other pieces of freely available software, GNU Emacs and the GNU C compiler.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds, a Finnish national studying in the United States, supplied the missing piece - an operating system that resembled UNIX and which he made freely available; this is Linux.</p>
<p>Today, many pieces of free software are available to use with Linux; GNU Fortran, FontForge, Maxima, the X Window System with window managers such as fvwm, KDE, and Gnome.</p>
