  body: But that was for side markings and smaller signs. The original series Enterprise
    had something else on top of the disc section, a condensed bold Gothic of some
    kind. I'm a bit surprised to see Microgramma on top as in this shot. But then,
    there are a lot of subtle and not so subtle differences between this new movie
    model and the original TV design.

  body: Yes, Starfleet Bold Exteded was a modified version of Microgramma Bold Extended
    with an outline, usually a red outline when used for hull markings (note the image
    of the back of the box shows only uppercase, distinguishing Microgramma from Eurostile).
    This is a later style that made its way into canon in the movies.

    hull panels before attaching them to the frame."

  body: "<em>Does the technical manual only cover the original series...?</em>\r\n\r\nBasically,
    yes. It was issued in the mid 1970s (when the first Star Trek movie was barely
    a glimmer in Gene Roddenberry's eye), and most of it was based on the original
    TV show, which at the time was gaining in popularity thanks to syndicated re-runs.
    Some of the material, though, like the banners of the star systems that belonged
    to Star Fleet, was either new or previously unpublished. The same people who created
    the Star Fleet manual (Franz Joseph Designs) also came up with complete blueprints
    of the U.S.S. Enterprise from the original show.\r\n\r\n"

    considered \"Taboo\" by the folks who own/run the license (Paramount). They usually
    only bless the newer stuff (written published after TNG started up), and 90% of
    that is by Mike & Denise Okuda (Mike is responsible for most all of the graphics
    on next Generation/DS9/Voyager/& all but the earliest movies). For example, all
    of the condensed fonts in TNG displays/signage looks like compacta, but it's actually
    Corporate Condensed (which I always found funny for a Trek universe).\r\n\r\n"
