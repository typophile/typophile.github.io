  body: ' Crane &amp; Company have been around a long, long time &#40;they&#39;re
    just up the road from me&#41;. I can&#39;t recall how long they&#39;ve been using
    this copperplate identity, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s a custom
    piece, perhaps even originally done in actual copperplate engraving &#40;especially
    since I think that was their stock in trade at one point&#41;. <BR> <BR>I highly
    doubt you&#39;ll find an exact digital match. <BR> <BR>-- K. '
