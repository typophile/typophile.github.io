  has this awesome drawer type of which I was given that ampersand! Is the type Futura?
  I think it is, I think I got this one...\r\n\r\nThe size of the type is 94.5pt ...or
  at least the ampersand measures 1 5/16\"\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    it's with me. Nice gift from my new print shop. \r\n\r\nI guess there's no way
    of telling the age of the type?\r\n\r\n"
