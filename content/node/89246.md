  good design bookstores across the USA. Mainly looking in the big cities, New York,
  LA, Chicago etc. but if anyone knows of any really great ones dotted around it would
  be cool to hear about them.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,
  \r\nSam "

    last I heard of Bevan Davies, its sainted owner, he was trying his hand at farming
    in Maine.  But St. Marks Books, though not a design bookstore per se, has a great
    selection.  It's now round the corner from St. Marks Place on Stuyvesant Street,
    though its mailing address for some reason is 31 3rd Avenue.\r\n\r\nAnd, though
    I'll be flamed for this, many of the big Barnes & Nobles in Manhattan are actually
    quite strong on both graphic design books and magazines.  They're not a pleasure
    to browse, but they've got the goods, and that does count."

    design books. \r\n\r\nThe Powell's locations are all pretty great for design/type/booksonbooks.\r\n\r\nThere's
    Prairie Avenue Books, oh wait, they just closed. Crap. Anyway, they were awesome.
