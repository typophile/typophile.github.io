		<div class="commentbody">All of these are good points. Early offers paid smaller percentages, ITC for instance, but in that case we got a &quot;most favourable up front signing fee&quot;, they did all the work. ITC made a big event of a new releases. This was not exclusive. We released our own version of the same title, same artwork. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other option would have been to sub-license the font back. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another company paid $5000.00 up front.
