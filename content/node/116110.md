  it and am trying to find the font of the numbers. \r\nSomeone mentioned maybe Interstate?
  But it doesn't match all numbers.\r\n\r\nAny ideas???\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nThe

  body: Interesting, it looks like the two 1s in this sample, from the same clock
    face, are different styles.

  body: If you are refering to the slight curve in the slant on the 1 of the 10, I
    think it is some kind of blemish on the clock face, more apparent when you play
    with image in PhotoShop
