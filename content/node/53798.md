  reproducing the products we create into several languages worldwide. In doing so,
  we have hit a couple of stumbling blocks. The main issue we are having is punctuation
  in European countries, it seems to vary so much and we can't seem to lock down a
  standard across the board. We want to keep the consideration of the culture of course
  (i.e., French, German, Spanish), but we would like a consistently designed product
  for branding purposes.\r\n\r\nThe main issues are punctuation. In North America,
  we hang the punctuation and would like to make this the standard across our products,
  but we are meeting some resistance. Also, in many cases, there is a space before
  end punctuation (i.e., question mark or exclamation point), but this isn't always
  happening. So I would like to get some consensus on these as I have done some searching
  on International Typography Standards, and have had difficulty nailing anything
  solid down.\r\n\r\nIf there are any European designers with experience in Typography,
  or any Typographers with International experience, I would really appreciate your
  input. \r\n\r\nAgain, the main issue is we want to standardize our typography based
  on our North American foundation, but not at the expense of the country's history
  and culture."

  body: "Hello Cory,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t standardize those habits/rules.
    \u2018Detailtypografie\u2019 by [[Friedrich Forssman]] and [[Ralf de Jong]] has
    a chapter dedicated to those particularities of a number of languages (English,
    Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Dutch, Swedish, French, Italian, Latin, Portuguese,
    Spanish, Polish, Czech, Ancient Greek, Fnnish, Hungarian, Turkish). It adresses
    special (accented) characters, quotation marks, punctuation (spacing) and several
    other details worth knowing of, like capitalization or hyphenation rules. The
    book is only available in German so far, and it is not very cheap, but it still
    might be of great help to you. "

  body: Hi Florian, thank you for your input, any information we can get is helpful.
    Do you know, specifically regarding hanging punctuation, if that is common European
    practice? I am aware that it is not always quotes as we have in North America,
    but would like to know if that can be consistent, or if it just doesn't make sense.

  body: 'AFAIK, hanging punctuation has not so much to do with languages as it does
    with the awareness for typographic quality. In German, it is known as <em>Randausgleich</em>
    [margin alignment]. The aforementioned Detailtypografie says: Hanging punctuatiuon,
    i.e. outdenting quotation marks etc. by their full width, should only be considered
    for a few large lines.'

    but the punctuation need not hang so much to produce good results."

  body: That's my feeling Florian. I was just looking for some confirmation that,
    visually, having the text fully aligned is okay and not breaking any cultural
    rules. Your input is very helpful, thank you again!
