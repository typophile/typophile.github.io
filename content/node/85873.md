  body: "To me it looks like it was originally photographed against a black background,
    but the background came out as a very dark gray (rather than black) in the photo,
    so he darkened the background further in Photoshop. However he didn't take the
    time to create a path around the exact outline of the book, so there are places
    where the original, not-quite-black background still shows.\r\n\r\nIf you're trying
    to take similar photos you might want to take some test shots first using different
    exposures."
