  body: 'I''m not holding out a lot of hope for that: this site just isn''t behaving
    properly. I thought that, with all the downtime for maintenance lately, some things
    would improve, but that doesn''t appear to be the case. For instance, the "most
    recent items posted" entries on the "Forums" page are not current and, in some
    cases, are a day or more behind. Wuzzup with that?'

  body: I was referring to the last posts listed for each of the forums on the "Forums"
    page. Those listings are not current.

  body: They're current in that they show the most recently started thread, but they
    don't show the most recent post, which is somewhat annoying considering the heading
    is 'last post'

  body: I suppose there's some logic to it - It stops new threads that don't get commented
    on straight away disappearing down the page before anyone sees them.
