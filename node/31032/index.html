I would not, however, be surprised to see governments and businesses standardize on XPS due to the percieved simplicity of using only Microsoft standards and because the built in DRM system will make it harder for employees to leak documents. I know that people in the military/intelligence fields will love being able to lock down printing and taking screenshots to a single workstation within an entire enterprise without using resorting to trusted Solaris.</div>

What I like about XPS/XML/WPF is the end-to-end story based on a unified rendering model, with human-readable markup that actually specifies fonts and typographic features in an editable form. If all XPS does is force competitors to move further beyond the static document model and drives innovation is this space then that's a good thing, no?

Yes and no.

MS, via it's gigantic market share, can make it's own de-facto standards. And this is what happens.

It's usually NOT good for the consumer in the long run, but oh well. That is the way it is.

"I like XML. What I don’t like is that XPS is as equally proprietary as PDF but there are no current plans to make XPS cross-format;"

EXACTLY. MS has a long track record of using 'standard' formats to them make a completely proprietary MS format.

Sure there will be people/business who will use XPS for out of the box convenience, and that is fine. PDF isn't going anywhere, especially if XPS either sees no or limited support on other platforms. The only thing that will replace PDF will be a format anyone can use and is significantly better. I am just not seeing why many people should feel compelled to choose XPS over PDF.

I just added a note from Mike regarding the production process.

Not exactly easy, but likely a whole lot easier than doing the same thing with a PDF, EPS or InDesign file?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm surprised ODF (Open Document Format), a format that was announced with much ado, isn't really mentioned. XPS, I feel, won't be a big thing because PDF workflows in print shops and graphic companies have been virtually standardised. It's a file format that is ubiquitous, and while often (in Government and other instances) there is not even the question of cross-compatibility, the presence of the Mac in the graphic sector does command it. ODF is an open standard for a human- and machine-readable document, which I would truly love.

I too think competition is good but the best product does not always succeed. Often it has to do with market penetration and what becomes mainstream. Look at early examples, the querty versus the dvorak keyboard. I hope XPS inspires Adobe to further improve the PDF.</cite>

Well, Adobe's hearing the hounds on it's heels. The MARS project will be bringing (a bit) more XML into PDF, but I really hope to see ODF as even an option to export to. Hopefully, we will get a format out of this that is open, crossplaftorm, editable by hand and secure, since I don't trust propietary DRM either (see cases of Fairplay and current encryption schemes in PDF). But more than often, we will see a pretty good starting position and an iron marketing strategy give Microsoft the upper hand.</div>

Will there be an XPS reader integrated into mac office?

These fabulous new ClearType fonts will also be sold by Ascender- will there be any differences between the Ascender version and the version bundled with Vista? Last I heard Calibri had over 1000 glyphs and tons of alternates. And WPF fonts too?

I did Web searches and found MS people talking about Mac and Unix based viewers on their blogs - but have not found an official statement on that yet. 

>These fabulous new ClearType fonts will also be sold by Ascender- will there be any differences between the Ascender version and the version bundled with Vista? 

Ascender currently has some very narrow rights to the ClearType Collection fonts, and are not "selling them" in the traditional sense. This isn't very clear from their web site. I'll talk to them about it.

>I’m also very interested to know if XPS will be integrated into mac office 

I saw some blog entries related to that, but again nothing official 

>and if the ‘c’ fonts will ship with mac office too. 

Obviously that would seem sensible, but sorry nothing official. :-)

>Is there a plan to ship ‘c’ fonts for mac in any shape or form…license them to Apple or Adobe maybe?!!

Sorry I can't talk about that. But we're always interested in talking to people about licensing and we're open to any ideas. An example is this one... http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=5747
