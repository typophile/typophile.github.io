body: Does anyone know what font is used here (gray text)? Communication Arts uses
  it on their website. I emailed and they responded with "Adobe Garamond Bold" and
  I thought "What????"

  body: "They have a different quote there at the moment, but it is text and not a
    graphic. This means that they may actually have been using Adobe Garamond Bold
    [italic], and you would have seen something you had on your machine, if you did
    not have that font loaded.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Georgia was designed by Matthew Carter to be a web and screen font, and it
    is one of the 'standard' web serif fonts, along with Times. When those are not
    used you probably see Adobe Serif default font. At least this has been how it
    seems to work for years. Maybe there are newer ways to control fonts by embedding
    them, but I think this is not used much yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
