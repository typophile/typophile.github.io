  body: Actually, my very old &#40;1994?&#41; water-stained specimen shows a set of
    oldstyle figures for Arepo. For some reason the Agfa Alliance fonts do not include
    these.  <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m going to disagree that there is such a strong need
    for these, or for all the trappings. I believe Arepo was designed as strictly
    a display face, a companion to Sumner&#39;s Cycles or Stone Print. As such, there
    is less call for figures in general, and I&#39;ve always felt that the lining
    numerals were sufficient &#40;perhaps even superior&#41; for titling use.  <BR>
    <BR>If you want to set serious, extended text, with all due finesse, then you&#39;ll
    want the Cycles family. This, I believe, is Stone&#39;s real magnum opus. And
    in a way, Cycles, Stone Print, and Arepo are all members of one extended family.

  body: Hrant -- I think Stone Print is borderline. I wouldn&#39;t use it for book
    text, but I would consider it for magazine work &#40;which is, of course, what
    it was designed for&#41;. I do agree that it lives at the very narrow end for
    text work. I actually like to use it for modest heads and secondary, mid-range
    material. <BR> <BR>Colin -- you can license Cycles directly from Sumner Stone.
    His contact information is on the temporary web page at the site that Rodolfo
    cited above. <BR> <BR>Rodolfo -- even in U&amp;lc display I often prefer lining
    figures for heads &amp; titling. But that&#39;s a personal preference. If you
    license Arepo directly from Sumner, I believe you can get the OsF thrown in. If
    you already have a license through Agfa &#40;I suppose you must&#41;, perhaps
    he might consider giving you an &#34;upgrade&#34; for a small additional fee --
    you&#39;d have to ask him. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    sorry for getting back to you so late. I only used Silica on a short article,
    in the news section of our then magazine FontNews, so I had no immediate need
    for an italic. I agree though that the inavailability of italics can be harmful
