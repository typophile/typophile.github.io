  I want to hear it! :)

    as opposed to a logo. Any suggestions, anyone, on what I can do to spice it up
    a bit more?"

    a bit and came up with a different design. I used Whitney for the font, maybe
    there's something more suitable?\r\n\r\nAlso, what logo looks best?"

    this a real company? It sounds so generic."

    more creative with meaning behind it, and I was drawing a blank.\r\n\r\n@penn\r\nI
    also agree that the mark and the font don't quite seem to match up. Any suggestions
    on that?\r\n\r\n"

    logo, it's just the second one that I made that didn't really have a meaning.\r\n\r\n@frode
    frank\r\nI would love to hire a designer, however it's a small startup and thats
    one expense I'm not sure I can afford at this point.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for
    all your feedback though! I really appreciate it! :)"

    branding guidance will pay off in increased income and help make your start-up
    more viable. The hours you\u2019ll spend designing this * your hourly rate could
    easily be better spent with a professional."

  body: '@frode - It really depends on the nature of the startup. If they have a need
    to appeal to random public and to form a specific company image, then - sure,
    the logo is certainly important. But if the company merely services a narrow niche
    on the market and relies on its sales for business, then the logo does not really
    matter; a membership in a proper golf club does :)'
