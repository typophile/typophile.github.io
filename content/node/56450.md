body: "Hi all. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this typeface. It's currently the 26
  upper and lowercase letters and I hope to expand it to bold and light weights with
  the full set of glyphs. I think I've identified the \"problem\" letters but I'd
  like to get opinions on that.\r\n\r\nThe initial plan was to create a straightforward,
  functional sans-serif but it morphed into more of a headline/display face as I went
  along and figured out its personality. Now I could see this being used primarily
  as a headline face, maybe part of an identity system, who knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floop_01_3796.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floop_02_5048.gif]"

  body: That lowercase g is memorable. But I think you need to make your lettershapes
    harmonize together a bit more. Some lettershapes (especially in contrast to others)
    seem a touch awkward and unbalanced.

  body: some nice signature shapes on this one, but agree with bemerx25 that you need
    to work on balancing the colour and rhythm

  body: "I think you could dial back the lift of v/w/y. The idea is a nice one but
    it just goes a bit too high IMO.\r\nMy eye wants the bottom of l (lowercase L)
    to taper in the other direction. i too.\r\nSome lingering \"straightforward functional
    sans\" remains in many of the caps - basically every curveless capital letter
    (AEFHILMNTXYZ) needs more \"floop\"!\r\nThe \"harmonization\" already mentioned
    would include reconciling the different terminals (e.g. bottom ends of j and t.\r\nI
    like the capital U and V particularly."

  body: I like it. I'd made one suggestion for now. Did you try to reverse the lower
    storey of the g?  It's seems to sit on his back or unhappy to my eyes. I'd also
    reduce a bit the bowl of the R and increase the one on the P or only increase
    the P. Let's make some test.

  body: "I'll be going back to the lab with this one. Good comments all.\r\nThere's
    a lot of curves and \"pointy parts\" to wrangle here.  One concern I had is that
    some of the lowercase letters are too wide. (a,b,d,p,q,r,u) Probably some culprits
    with my rhythm problem there. Good catch on the j and t terminals. \r\nCould you
    better explain the reversing of the g? That was actually my starting letter and
    I want to make sure I get that one right. :)"

    it looks more happy, but you have the final decision.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yogurt_2_5248.png]

  body: "Thoughts on these g's? The original intent was to bypass the link on the
    g altogether to get one big sweeping loop. I've been staring at this thing for
    so long that I'm not sure what the right balance is.  Thus...the other options
    you see.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floop_g1_3686.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floop_g2_6145.gif]"

  body: you could move the lower bowl to the right.... I know that would be more conventional
    but it might work.

  body: "That last one sure is interesting. It looks like a fruit (with the ear like
    a leaf) or a sleeping baby curled up. What about disconnecting the bowl from the
    tail completely? I love it.\r\n\r\nIf I were to suggest one main thing it would
    be to make it more quirky. It looks a bit like a standard sans with some customised
    bits added on. Take N for example. It has a very different style to B or E. Or
    Z and K. Now you've got the underlying shapes there, I'd go really mad with the
    curves, see which ways they can be pushed then start bringing the glyphs back
    in towards each other so they harmonise. Like Craig said, add more floop!\r\n\r\nDid
    you try B with the top curve continuing into the counterspace rather than the
    bottom one? And what about an arched M rather than pointy? T looks dark. E and
    F have dark middle strokes. In fact generally the horizontal strokes 'should'
    be a few units thinner than the vertical ones. j descends too far. Crossbars on
    f and t could be a touch lower.\r\nThe caps look quite narrow.\r\n\r\nJust my
    thoughts, see what you think, play with the floop and see what happens :)\r\n"

  body: 'IMO the g was already about as busy as could work in a typeface; 2, 3, and
    4 look like logos to me. Nice logos, to be sure, but I think a font with every
    g looking like any of those will be not that functional. '

    these, but will probably experiment with the quirkiness factor. Note the more
