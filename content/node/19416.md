body: "I was wondering if anyone had any guidelines they used for typesetting the
  @ in e-mail addresses. I really don't much like the look of the placement of the
  @-sign in many fonts, and I'm not so sure about the size either. It looks more like
  it was designed for the previous usage as the commercial \"each\" where it would
  stand alone.\r\n\r\nBelow are three iterations of an e-mail address in 9pt Palatino
  typeset with latex. The top one is straight out of the box (except for a \\kern0.5pt
  between the @ and the c). The second one is the same size, but lowered 0.25ex to
  approximately center the a in the @ with the x-height. The third one has the @ at
  8pt and lowered 0.15ex for the same positioning. The c following the @ might have
  a lot to do with my problem with the typesetting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/at-signs.png]\r\n\r\nI've
  also experimented with aligning the top of the @ with the midline, and the bottom
  of the @ with the baseline and I'm kind of torn. The reactions I get are one of
  two: \"Whatever\" or \"Suck up and deal with the @ you're given.\" I was hoping
  this would be a more constructive if not congenial forum. So is there anything people
  usually do with large high @'s?\r\n\r\n"

  body: i don't think i've ever actually used the @ in any kind of design, so i've
    never really thought about it, but in your case the 2nd example certainly looks
    best. considering the @ is mostly used for all lowercase email addresses it makes
    the most sense for it to align better with lowercase than uppercase as it does
    now (for the most part).

    numerals, not lowercase. Smaller foundries are starting to get this, but the big
    guys have a lot of catching up to do. Your 2nd solution is best. The size change
    isn't so good.\r\n\r\nAnd props for being a latex user. Not many of you guys 'round
    here."

  body: "Thanks for the replies (and the latex support!). Otf fonts could (and maybe
    they do) include both an uppercase and lowercase @. Xetex I know--and I'm sure
    the commercial layout applications too--can select between upper and lowercase
    glyphs; Adobe Garamond Pro, for example, has an uppercase hyphen.\r\n\r\nA tangential
    question is parentheses with lining numerals: move those up a skosh?\r\n"

    version, I believe that it will make it easier to read/understand and therefore
    more memorable.\r\nIf a skosh equals a couple of gnat's then I agree.\r\nTim"
