    either but that gets you a bit closer (on the M). "

    seems to have about the right letterform shapes, if you add stroke and a lot of

  body: "I recognised it from the first [[http://www.yesstudio.co.uk/view/maximo/archive|Max\xEFmo
    Park]] album campaign. According to London based studio YES, \"...Maximus Bold
    was created for the project.\" The only difference I can see is that on the Max\xEFmo
    Park stuff they sometimes fill in the counter on the A. Maybe Far-Marks was used
    as a basis for the design."
