    ID of the same typeface from the same magazine (even using a sample from the same
    article) quite recently. Don\u2019t you remember? As <a href=\"http://www.velux.de/de-DE/Documents/PDF/Architektur/Magazin_Daylight_and_Architecture/07_Velux_Daylight_Winter_2007.pdf\">this</a>
    PDF confirms, it\u2019s still Adobe Garamond."
