body: "I'm laying out a booklet, the purpose of which is to present information in
  a tone that is ponderous, pedantic and authoritative. Reading it should be like
  listening to an overbearing, low-level city official explaining some unavoidable
  bureaucratic procedure. The content is self-important, without soul, and the presentation
  needs to have a sort of conniving and vaguely menacing feel to it. The look aims
  to be clean, organized, reserved and pleasant, but in a way that is also dictatorial
  and intimidating.\r\n\r\nIn searching for a sans serif and serif pair to handle
  the headers, body, footnotes, &c., I've been using Scala and Chronicle; they have
  a nice presence, but feel that there is still too much personality in there, so
  I'm looking for alternatives. Any suggestions? "

  body: "No kidding! Something that painful really would be appropriate. This is sort
    of a tough call because it really does need to be sharp and professional \u2014
    like a uniform, it needs the impersonal theatricality of power. Minion seems suitably
    dry and works well with Franklin Gothic, but it still feels sort of \"likable.\""

  body: Thanks, Nick. I was just looking at Myriad and Georgia and hadn't thought
    of Verdana.

  body: 'A good way to get this effect is to use all sans for text. It mimics the
    choices of a bureaucrat who thinks that simplicity is clarity and that regular
    people are too stupid to read serifs. And, of course, it should feel a bit dated:
    Futura is a popular choice for this sort of thing.'

  body: I've been duplicating and resetting the style sheets for this and the all-futura
    look definitely makes for a pretty severe read. This is about 50 text-heavy pages
    so that gets to be a lot. Thanks much, I'm saving it for an option for sure.

  body: Whatever font you choose, consider using a slightly heavier weight than you'd
    normally pick, justified, and long line lengths with narrow margins.

  body: "Thanks for that. And Utopia and News Gothic are pretty arid. It seems that
    the more time I spend with this the more difficult it becomes \u2014 I'm working
    for something that looks really good but is entirely bloodless. Which is hard
    to do without making it ugly. The heavier weight and longer line lengths do effectively
    feel a bit pompous and insensitive but actually reading long passages then becomes
    genuinely straining. So I don't know. Perhaps the objective is a pair that dresses
    up very nicely at a glance but whose banality becomes more apparent the more time
    you spend with it. "
