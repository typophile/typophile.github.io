body: I&#39;ve heard on and off that zero-width glyphs cause problems here and there,
  but I don&#39;t remember ever seeing a broad answer about it. I know that some people
  give such glyphs &#40;like the stand-alone floating accents&#41; a minimal width
  &#40;like 2 ems?&#41; to avoid any issues, but in a pixelfont for example this wouldn&#39;t
  work well. Does TT hinting provide any avenue? <BR> <BR>Any insights at all appreciated.

  body: I don&#39;t see why you want to do that &#40;advance width = zero&#41; anyway.
    Can you give us another example? <BR>And IIRC, floating accents usually come centered
    in &#40;apparently&#41; arbitrary widths &#40;500 units, for example&#41;. What&#39;s
    the advantage of setting them to zero-width?

  body: 'I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re building, but be careful if you&#39;re doing
    anything involving color overlaying of characters -- I once built a zero-width
    font to create flag icons for an multi-language magazine, to facilitate pasting
    the icons within a QXP text flow. Each flag was 3 or 4 characters, with each character
    a different color of the flag. We tested it for film output on a Scitex RIP with
    no problem, but when we changed pre-press houses at the last minute, the new place
    couldn&#39;t get them to output as anything but 4-color black squares on their
    Linotype RIP. They had to do some sort of mystery trapping magic &#40;that I was
    not privy to&#41; to fool the machine. '

  body: It makes sense to make them [near-]zero-width because you can then place them
    -left aligned- on any other character. Sometimes that results badly &#40;like
    on a dotless-i&#41;, but it seems like the best default scheme, no? Unless there&#39;s
    special code somewhere to ignore the metrics and render the accent centered/spanning
    the middle of the base character? I know keyboards have &#34;deadable&#34; characters
    that only render out in combinations of base&#43;accent, but I think that&#39;s
    only a keying thing, not encoding. <BR> <BR>Patrick, I wonder if kerning pairs
    &#40;between non-zero-width glyphs&#41; would help. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Would it be possible to make your dicritics one pixel wide, and kern them
    -1 pixel with every glyph in the font? I imagine that&#39;d be a breeze with class-based
    kerning in FL. That&#39;s not a very elegant solution, but in effect you&#39;d
    have zero-width characters.

  body: Well, I hope it does work. I&#39;m working on a Thai bitmap face right now,
    and the diacritics really do need to be zero width. Otherwise it&#39;s going to
    look like a bloody train wreck :-/ <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s to hoping...
