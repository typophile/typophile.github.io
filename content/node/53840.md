  the Bush administration is primarily interested in is regime change in the United
  States, not regime change in Iraq or South East Asia or the Balkans. A foreign war
  is a wonderful lollipop to stuff in the mouth of a possibly quarrelsome press.\u201D
  Lewis H. Lapham.\r\n \r\nTo celebrate the ultimate regime change - the end of the
  Bush presidency - today on the day of the Presidential Inauguration Virus Fonts
  are releasing Regime, our first new font in over a year.\r\n \r\nRegime is based
  on 19th century slab serif British Empire letterforms. Redrawn, made a little more
  contemporary, a little more playful and with alternate weights featuring more experimental
  characters.\r\n \r\n'Regime's is available in 16 styles in OpenType, PostScript
  and TrueType formats. Ranging from the Regular to be used for text to Ultra, an
  extreme bold font based on wooden poster fonts to be used for display.\r\n\r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\n\r\nDesign:
  Marcus Leis Allion and Jonathan Barnbrook\r\nhttp://www.virusfonts.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Regime-typh-01_3559.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Regime-typh-02_5698.png]"

    we''ve traded the Bush regime for an Obama regime I can see this font working

  body: "Interesting project. But I'm just curious... Why are the Opentype fonts $10
    cheaper than the Type1/TrueType? Its a strategy to encourage people to buy the
    OT version or is because you have one file instead of two? And why it applies
    to single fonts but not to the complete family? \r\n\r\n-Crystian Cruz"

  body: "Crystian,\r\n\r\nThanks for the question. The confusion appears to come from
    our pricing structure. We offer a slight discount on preset packages (the current
    packages are single, double, family, and complete). So rather than doubling the
    price when purchasing two single weights there is a slight discount as it is placed
    in the package \u2018double\u2019. Finally, as our Regime Opentype package \u2018contains\u2019
    2 styles (regular and alternate) this formats pricing reflects that and begins
    at a two style price. Hope that's all clear\r\n\r\n- Marcus"
