body: "Busy doing some work for a company who has an existing logo (see sample) which
  was designed last year and I am trying to identify the font so that we can add accompanying
  text to the logo.\r\n\r\nHave done a search on \u2018What the font\u2019 and \u2018Identifont\u2019,
  but have not been able to find a match.\r\n\r\nAny assistance would be appreciated,
  either a close match that you think could have been slightly modified.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Adrian\r\n\r\nHere's the image\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olsenslogo_5394.gif]"

    the O and e are different. Maybe it's a custom draw/modification by Dalton Maag?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    definitely on track with the tapered edges, although not exact. I think that it
    would have to be custom and the letterforms actually look like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008|H&FJs'
    Gotham]] with the custom terminals. What do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olsens_comparison_5849.gif]"
