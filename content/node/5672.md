  body: I dont think the moon on the bottom layout works because it looks like a &#34;c&#34;.

  body: Hi Tom <BR> <BR>at first look i think you have a problem with the top of your
    P and R, is too thick, and i agree that the O should be the first one. <BR> <BR>also,
    the bottom of your Es are too long, and the H is too wide for me. <BR> <BR>nice
    anyway <BR> <BR>CG

  body: 'tom, i agree, that the bottom one looks like a C -- perhaps you could rotate
    it a bit more? like this . . . <BR> <BR>i think either direction for the moon
    shape would work, though. Also, i am not a type expert, but it seems as though
    you either need to make the P curve at the bottom a little thicker or the R curve
    a little thinner: <BR> <BR>here is what i mean about the moon rotated and the
    R thinner. <BR> <BR>I also agree the bottom of the E is too long. Of course, this
    is all nit-picking refinement stuff --great logo.'

  body: Sally -- somehow I think that your moon pointing south-east, as well as Tom&#39;s
    first moon pointing south-west, don&#39;t work due to ... well, astronomy. You
    don&#39;t see the moon that way on our hemisphere, do you? Anyway, I think that
    north-east has most &#39;universalilty&#39;. &#40;Red Crescent -- the non-christian
    equivalent to Red Cross has its opening pointing east&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    see a problem misreading O for C ... having read &#39;THE&#39; and &#39;SLEEP&#39;
    I&#39;m sure noone would go on &#39;STCRE&#39; ... <BR> <BR>You still need to
    adjust the upper stem/curve joints in P and R. <BR> <BR>I would prefer a normal
    leg to R ... considering its position right next to the pun. <BR> <BR>I agree
    with those that say the E is too broad ... the more &#39;dull&#39; the other letters
    are, the more interesting the moon! <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

  body: 'in my opinon, the direction of the moon doesn&#39;t need to be taken so literally
    . . . it looks better and reads more fluently with it facing in a direction that
    is not &#34;realistic.&#34; i think the readability is more important than the
    astrological correctness. '

  body: Why blue? <BR>Why is the moon blue, with black spots on it?  <BR> <BR>IMPO
    I feel like the moon is being forced into a letter that should really be a C.
    <BR> <BR>Have you tried white type on a Black/Navy Background? <BR> <BR>I am not
    getting to much comfort out of the typeface. I feel like it is a little sharp
    for my bed. <BR>
