body: Hi, since I installed firefox the way I see unread messages has become eratic.  Sometimes
  I get the correct number of flags and other times I get every thread marked as unread.  This
  happens in firefox and internet explorer.  What am I doing wrong? <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR> <BR>Sharon

  body: Does anyone have any ideas for Sharon? Not sure if I should move this thread
    or just let it archive itself. Does anyone else use Firefox that has had similar
    problems?

  body: I just started using Firefox &#40;on a PC&#41;, and have the same experience.
    Is this only Firefox, or are others experiencing the same thing?

    a charm though. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: If you just switched browsers I&#39;d be curios to see if the problem persists.
    The feature should flag posts that are new to you, and not that are new to the
    site. So, over time hopefully they won&#39;t all be flagged &#39;new&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>As an end-note, go Firefox! &#40;If I was a PC user, that&#39;s where I&#39;d
    be.&#41;

  body: It does seem to just be firefox.  And it doesn&#39;t always do it.  Just wondered
    if it was some weird setting I needed to change.  Overall, I like firefox a lot.

  body: Sharon <BR> <BR>Do you clear your cookies or have Firefox set to clear them
    when you close the browser? Also, does it happen no matter what or if you look
    at a thread does it unmark itself? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing your cache or cookies
    are being deleted. <BR> <BR>DeWitt

  body: DeWitt, I checked and it&#39;s not set to clear cookies or the cache.  If
    I look at a thread it shows it&#39;s clear then but the next time I come back
    it shows it as unread even if there are no new posts.  More of an annoyance than
    anything.
