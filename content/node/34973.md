  body: "Thanks, Stephen. Lucida Grande (not Bright, which is a serif) is the variant
    I was thinking of.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion here: http://www.typophile.com/node/30537\r\n\r\n\"You
    can only count on \u201CLucida Grande\u201D being installed on Mac OS X systems,
    since it\u2019s the main UI font and I don\u2019t think you could delete it even
    if you wanted to. But Lucida Grande is just a newer version of Lucida Sans with
    an incredibly large character set. There is a similar version of Lucida Sans included
    with Windows 2000/XP called \u201CLucida Sans Unicode.\u201D Finally, the basic
    Lucida Sans ships with Microsoft Office products and thus can commonly be found
    on many Windows and Mac systems. It also has a true italic, which Lucida Grande
    and Lucida Sans Unicode lack.\r\n\r\n\"The most interesting thing about the three
    different versions is that while their common glyphs share mostly identical outlines,
    each one is hinted differently, giving it a noticeably different look when rendered
    at smaller sizes (at least under Windows).\""

  body: There was also another thread from a few months ago when I asked for the differences
    between the two fonts. Can't find it, sadly.
