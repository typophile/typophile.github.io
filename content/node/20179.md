  Fontographer is really buggy with Windows XP, but I want to verify something about
  Fontlab since the company's website seems determined to hide PC-related facts from
  the user.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJonas"

      but I wanted to start making fonts.

    what kind of information you were looking for that is missing? \r\n\r\nI can confirm
    what Ralf is saying \u2014 FontLab 4.6 and FontLab Studio 5.0.2 are very stable
    on Windows. The Mac version of FontLab 4.6 was not very stable, FontLab Studio
    5.0.2 on Mac is better but I think the Windows version is still a bit ahead of
    that. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
