  Can anyone offer suggestions for a font that can serve this purpose that is professional
  and sophisticated yet sporty and casual? Something a bit flowy, flourishy and calligraphic
  but not too much.\r\n\r\nOlicana Rough is almost perfect.\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000020#flont\r\n\r\nEmily
  Austin is great but I'd like something more modern.\r\nhttp://www.typequarry.com/type.html?sku=042&cart=10614938411026231\r\n\r\nCaliban
  is close but I'm looking for something with a bit more personality.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caliban/\r\n\r\nGizmo.\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000006#flont\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for any help you can provide!"

  body: I dont get it, cant you just digitze your own signature? Seems more realistic
    and personal. . . surely you can make it look good unless you have some rotten
    name?

  body: I don't quite get it either. If it's for your signature, why aren't you using
    your signature?

    body: "I understand your responses. Honestly, I'm really struggling with creating
      an appealing signature worthy of inclusion on my product. At a minimum, I'd
      like to have a nice font to use as a guide to generate my own personal signature.
      I thought I'd start by seeing what kind of style I like and then create my own
      style.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!"
