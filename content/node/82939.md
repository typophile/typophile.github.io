  the questions on Identifont with no luck. The P is quite unusual.\r\n\r\nMany thanks

  body: Many thanks riccard0. Quorum Standard was suggested via the Identifont questions
    and answers but I had dismissed it. I hadn't looked closely enough to realise
    that another weight may have be the one. That is a good lesson - next time I will
    be more diligent. Kind regards from downunder in Australia.
