    of books about typography and type design</a>. You\u2019ll find stuff both on
    type design history and practice depending on what you\u2019re looking for. To
    get started in type design all-around, there is what some people call \u201C<a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/13490\">the triumvirate</a>\u201D, which
    includes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><cite>Letters of Credit</cite> by Walter Tracy</li>\r\n<li><cite>Anatomy
    of a Typeface</cite> by Alexander Lawson</li>\r\n<li><cite>Counterpunch</cite>
    by Fred Smeijers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    to get a new bringhurst one (my second copy is almost worn out from use;-)\r\n\r\nI
    will definetely get the ones I haven't got and then it's just a matter of getting

    some more time to study;-)"

    At first blush I was really very impressed with it. It <i>looks</i> wonderful.
    And, then, to be fair, I must admit that I realized that part of its impressiveness
    is because it's printed on heavy paper: it is <i>literally</i> a weighty tome.
    Flipping through it and seeing all the examples of letterforms only reinforces
    my sense that it will be aterrific reference.\r\n\r\nThat said, it does follow
    a now customary, but annoying habit: a seemingly very good book on design that
    is itself a bad example of design: tiny, light-faced sans serif main body type.\r\n\r\nCan
    someone please fill me in on the \"much debate about the usefulness of this book\"?\r\n\r\nStephen

  body: "See [[http://www.typotheque.com/articles/designing_type_/|this review]] by
    Peter Bi\u013Eak, who is a superb type designer. \r\n\r\nEssentially his complaint
    is that the title is misleading, as Cheng doesn't approach type design as a type
    designer would. The best examples of the latter are \"Letters of Credit\" by Walter
    Tracy and the [[http://briem.ismennt.is/|Briem web site]]. \r\n\r\nStill, the
    comparisons are done well and well displayed, so it is a pleasure to read, and
    helpful. The bottom line is that the book is valuable, and does  something that
    you won't find elsewhere. I find the comparison of proportions of the caps, particularly
    nice. So it is a useful book, though more limited than you might expect from its
    title.\r\n\r\nOh, and I agree with you about the light weight of Univers for the
    text, on shiny paper; that kind of thing doesn't inspire confidence. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are designing type you will no doubt to much more of she has done by opening
    different fonts in a Font creation program, and pasting the outlines one over
    the other for comparison. "
