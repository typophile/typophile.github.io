  book for \"Die Neue Haas Grotesk\" is without success. I'm talking about the small
  round symbol after \"Haas\" as seen in these pictures:\r\n\r\nhttp://wlt.typography.netdna-cdn.com/data/images/2009/03/die-neue-haas-grotesk-cover.jpg\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HXkL-YzEMjM/R_TCYl5UP5I/AAAAAAAAABI/EVw3OCH7hYQ/s400/NeueHaasGrotesk.gif\r\nhttp://www.aisleone.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/dieneuehaas.jpg\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone recognize it?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch in advance!"

    it reminds me the shape of the Statue of Liberty :)\r\n"

  body: It's the symbol for the Haas foundry--a hare holding a piece of foundry type.
    It's in the "Helvetica Forever" book. "Haas" is German for "hare".

  body: "<cite>\"Haas\" is German for \"hare\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's surely the etymological
    root of the name, yes. For the sake of correctness, let me add that the proper
    German word for \"hare\" is \"Hase\" (from Middle High German \"hase\", Old High
    German \"haso\"); in Swiss German it's \"Has\", with a long \"a\" \u2013 so \"Haas\"
    (only spelled this way as a proper name) would be pronounced the same way (and
    surely, shares the same root)."

    know very much German. Here's a detail from the book:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/haas_4454.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote:
    the first two captions refer to photos not shown here."

    didn't so much mean to correct you than add to the info, or make it more precise.
    \r\nCan't have too much precision in type design :)"

    from the book (for the OP).
