    quote---\r\n\r\nWho designed the Chinese fonts LiSong and LiHei pre-installed
    in Mac OS X?\r\nFont designer Sammy Or (\u67EF\u71BE\u5805) from Hong Kong designed
    them in 1989. LiSong (serif) was designed for some of the newspapers in Hong Kong.
    The Li \u5137 in the names of these fonts means \u2018beautiful couple\u2019 literally,
    and is in the name of Or's second daughter, who was newly born then.\r\n\r\n(Source:
