  body: This is a very anorexic Didone, and I&#39;m not sure if  <BR>we&#39;ll be
    able to find a matching font as this could  <BR>very well be a custom drawn logo.
    <BR> <BR>Have a look at Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/index.html"
    target="_blank"> HTF Didot</a>, which  <BR>was originally developed for Harper&#39;s
    Bazaar.
