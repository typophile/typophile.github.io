body: "I've just designed my first font (after being a long time lurker...) and I've
  seriously caught the type bug! I've started initial ideas on 3 other faces since
  the completion of tracing my first font, Leena. \r\n\r\nHowever after designing
  it, scaling it fully in illustrator (descenders and ascenders) I've come to a dead
  end with Fontographer. I'm using 5 (and have limited time on it... I have to travel
  to uni to use it every time I attempt it) and can't figure out how to set the x
  height... my lower case a is the same height as a capital H and I can't figure out
  how to adjust this...\r\n\r\nAlso, the initial version of the font are multi-tonal
  which Fontographer seems to chew out as a solid b/w shape. The type is still legible
  in this format, but takes away from the look and feel (and even the concept) of
  the typeface in a solid monotone shape. \r\n\r\nAn example of the type multi-tonal
  approach I want can be found here - http://www.typographyserved.com/Gallery/Time-Type/568156\r\n\r\nIs
  this simply a matter of creating the font as symbols in illustrator as apposed to
  composing them as a font file?\r\n\r\nAny and all help will be appreciated. Looking
  forward to contributing to these forums :)"

    your characters for import with spacer marks at the Ascender and Descender extremes.
    Import all of your characters into FOG.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Erasmus_Mediaeval_6204.png]\r\n\r\nThen,
    find a reference point for your baseline. Zoom in and click the \"Guides\" checkbox.
    Drag a guideline to the baseline and make a note of its vertical position. Under
    FONT INFO, Dimensions, enter this number as your Descender, then subtract that
    number from 1000 to get your Ascender. Then select all of your glyphs and MOVE
    them DOWN this same value. Then RESET YOUR BASEPOINTS to 0,0."

  body: "As far as the multi-tonal aspect is concerned, most modern font formats only
    support pure black and white. I'm pretty sure Type 3 was the last format to support
    grayscale values and most modern software won't be compatible with Type 3 fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you might want to try is making a different font file for each color you want.
    Then you can layer them and change the fill as you see fit. A lot of type designers
    use this technique for drop shadowed, 3d, or pattern filled fonts."

  body: "Nick, I'm with you on what I should be doing, I can see a layers option for
    guides, by nothing else. I copy/pasted the font straight from illustrator a character
    at a time, should I have imported the whole document with guides etc. and selected
    them this way? (Completely new to FOG)\r\n\r\nI guessed as much Andrevv, if I'm
    being honest, I don't even know what I was expecting. I just dropped in the vectors
    after two weeks of tweaks and realized that as much as I'd thought through everything
    else about the font, I hadn't thought about the tonal aspect. The multiple fonts
    is a very nice idea, especially for practicality. I'm going to have to get my
    head around Fontographer first though...\r\n\r\nNevermind, just have to knuckle
    down and get some tutorials done... Got to many ideas at the moment to let software
    limit me :)"

    the heights in the next uni visit before getting down to some serious kerning...

  body: "There is one <em>caveat</em> about using this import method in FontLab: for
    some reason, if your spacing marks are not part of a solid figure, FontLab imports
    the EPS at less than full em-square height (the top image in the screengrabs below).
    A solid full em-height figure, such as the bar glyph in the bottom grab) <em>does</em>
