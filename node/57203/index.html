  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, I'm currently working on a new project and I'm having trouble making a decision. What do you think about these logos? It's for a snowboard company who is also selling downhill skateboard. I want to make two logos, one with the all "Pumpkin" word and another small one as a symbol. 

Any kind of critics are welcome...

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I like these, I think your logos look very appropriate for the market, maybe a little safe.

Also does anyone else read 'PLIMPKIN'? Maybe look at making the U a little more rounded and having more space between the U and the M.

Hope that helps</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your critic... I read Pumpkin easily, but yeah maybe more space will help.  The choice is hard between the straight and the rounded edges one (1 and 3). 

I really like number 2 and I'm trying to make the white and black holes look better. For example the inside of the "P" and the black on top of the intersection of "P" and "K".</div>

I like the look of these too, althougth i dont know if it imediately screams skateboarding - more slick mountainering gear.

		<div class="commentbody">Nice logos. My preference is no. 3 I like the rounded edges - seems more pumpkin-like. It probably doesn't really matter but I find the very sharp pointed angles disconcerting with the name pumpkin. However, that may be the point. 
And I read pumpkin not plimpkin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the rounded edges of  #3 work best for the reasons kirsten mentioned. i also think the border should be thicker, as it is in #1, for similar reasons. and yes a little tracking the letters apart will help with legibility, and thankfully gets rid of that connection between the lower leg of the K and the I that we see in #1.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks all of you for your comments. About that project: I'm studying Graphic Design in Brussels and this is my final project. I'm going to do their new identity, website, packaging, boards graphics... the all thing.

You can check their two website here: 
http://www.cloud-9.ch/schneebretter/index.html
http://www.cloud-9.ch/rollbretter/index.html

Currently they have two logos for one brand and I think one logo for the all "Pumpkin" brand suits better. About what Will said, I'm aware of that but their skateboards are slalom and downhill skateboards, often used on mountains and hills. I tried to put skate and snow in one logo (#2).

I like the rounded one too, but it doesn't really fit when I'm using it as the symbol "PK" #3.

		<div class="commentbody">I understand your concern about the rounded corners paired with the sharp angles of your icon. (although the contrast between the two doesn't bother me so much) You may want to re-think your symbol. A mountain range would be good for ski/snowboard manufacturer but for a Skateboard/snowboard manufacturer? Looks like you are ignoring half of the clientele. after Re-reading your original post stating you want 2 designs, a word mark and a symbol. I'm wondering are they going to be used for the different products? And while I like the look of the mark, it's starting to bother me the more I think about it, why PK? Does anyone abbreviate pumpkin PK? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Kirsten, thanks for your comment, it's always good to get different opinion.

I understand what you mean with the skate/snow manufacturer, and I'm aware of that. But as I said above, those skateboards are often used for speed and downhill. Those guys wear leather and helmet riding down mountains at incredible speed... That's why I think the mountain symbol isn't far from that kind of skateboarding. 

I'm still thinking about that option because as you said I don't want to ignore half of the clientele. And it's true not everybody rides skateboards in mountains.

I'm still in the early process of the logo so I'm trying things, that's why I came up with that PK. Maybe I could try to use the whole Pumpkin word and the mountain symbol without the PK. I know PK is not the abbreviation of Pumpkin, it's just an option to make a symbol out of the brand. 

@epsilicon 
Do you mean I should make the P and the N look like skateboard or snowboard edges?</div>

I don't think there will be a lot of people on this board that can actually consider themselves in your target audience, however, I can.

It might be worth looking at other brands that are established in the (longboard) downhill community; Landyachtz, Rayne and Sector9 spring to mind.

But in this downhill community you can distinguish two different groups; those who do it for the fun of it, and those that do it professionally. I think the logo you currently have is better suited for the first group, the second one is a bit more 'high tech', think 'nano-tube carbon-fiber'.

If you need the opinion of more people in the 'scene' try the forums of Silverfish Longboarding (the largest online community on longboarding).

Just a heads up; Pumpkin is already a name in use for a type of bushings made by Bear (subdivision of Landyachtz).</div>
