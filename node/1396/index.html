<div class=commentbody> It's great Ryan. <br> <br>Tell us more. I assume this is an original <br>design... or are these someone elses outlines <br>that you're animating? </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hey -- that's pretty cool. I'm glad you and Joe were able to get it posted for us to see. (I still haven't braved posting a Flash file, so my hat's off to you.) <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>The name definitely makes sense now. It's kind of fun to watch, too -- with a sort of "fritzing-out neon" feel to the sparking pixels. <br> <br>If, as Joe asked, this is an original outline as well, I certainly think you should complete the static version of it as well as the animated version. <br> <br>Would it be possible to see a full character set any time soon? <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Synapse 1.0 : a brief description <br> <br>The origins of creating type has traditionally been predicated by a reader engaging type as a static experience. With the relatively new accessibility of interactive media, I believe it is time for both typographer and reader to re-examine how type is created and engaged. Typography can no longer be viewed as a static event, bound by the pages of a book. Each letterform now has the potential to be an event within itself. A universe of activity could reside in the single letter "a". <br> <br>Synapse 1.0 is an experiment in time-based typography. It is a hybrid of the biological and the technological - an organism of undulating modules. Shapes rhythmically coalesce into familiar and abstracted letterforms. Beyond a statistical improbability, a reader will never experience the same letter "a" twice. <br> <br>Synapse 1.0 is an entirely original design inspired by various sources including Herbert Bayer's type designs, bitmap typography, and the destination signage on San Francisco's public transportation trains. I hope this typeface inspires conversation and debate. All comments are welcomed. <br> <br>The entire set for Synapse 1.0 is nearly complete. Uppercase, lowercase and numbering are ready for critique. These will be posted in the near future. Finally, I would like to thank Joe Pemberton for his assistance in posting this file. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>-RM </div>

<div class=commentbody>You sure do like hyping yourself up. <br> <br>I'd be interested in seeing the ActionScript behind this animation. Are you simply triggering movie clips randomly to flash the segments of the fonts, or is there method behind the sequencing? <br> <br>Being as it is called synaptic, I'd like to see a variant where the fluctuations are nerve-like responses to stimuli. <br> <br>Another avenue of exploration would be to really change the structure of the letters. Instead of just alpha-ing out segments of your letterform, what about designing a series of letterforms and utilising alternative segments to construct letters which are truly original each time. Even going so far as to breakdown each letter into a series of components - ascenders, descenders etc -and then construct each letter from random selections of each required component (This WOULD get messy, but hey, you wanted abstract). <br>Even calling upon the powers of Flashes drawing API to draw completely original shapes for each component every time - randomised within constraints. <br> <br>I'm just not sure at the moment that your really breaking new ground here yet. For 'time-based typography' we could just as easily read 'animated logo'.</div>
