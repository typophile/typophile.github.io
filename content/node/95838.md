body: "This could be hand-drawn. Their site uses \"English Hand DB Regular\" for headings
  and at a glance it's a decent match but that's definitely not what the logo uses.
  I've tried to hunt down the graphic designer but can't get anywhere. A client wants
  this font for a poetry design.  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize this font or was it
  hand drawn? Thanks:)"
