body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something along the lines of Avenir or Gotham
  that appears hand drawn upon close inspection, yet which looks clean and somewhat
  corporate-serious at a distance. A hand-drawn simulation of a typeface, not handwriting,
  if you will. Ideally a family with several weights of course.\r\n\r\nI first thought
  of technical/architectural blue-print lettering, but the letters are still too chirographic
  \u2013 modeled on the stroke of a pen or pencil, not from drawing the outline of
  a letter freehand and shading it in.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nRod Graves\r\nhttp://www.rodgraves.com"
