  body: "I think he was referring to the thin lines that are visible in some of the
    letters. In the upper sample, they're more visible but I can see them in the second
    sample too. I've adjusted the contrast so you can see them. If there are overlapping
    lines, you should remove them and clean up points before you launch it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yagi_5112.png]"

    It's marvelous what the Chinese can do as a product. I am amazed that they are
    still using rub down letters.\r\nBob Trogman\r\nFacsimile Fonts, Fotostar International"
