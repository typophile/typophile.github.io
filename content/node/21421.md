  faces that you like in particular from that era?\r\nRecommendations for display
  font sets from the time period would also be appreciated.\r\nRevival faces that
  have the feeling of that time period could also work.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nFG\r\n"

  body: "I've worked in a variety of styles and historical genres, but my only design
    that could be categorized as being particularly associated with 1930-50 is the
    basic Eunoia. It seems that the high-contrast, condensed sans serif, most notably
    Radiant, can be identified with that era. But looking at Eunoia, while the caps
    are reasonably authentic, the lower case isn't. I'm not sure this style is automobile-related,
    as such types tend to be extended, and/or slanted, qualities expressive of speed.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eunoia_5175.png]"

  body: "Wow\r\n\r\nI was just talking to my co-worker Glenda DeGuzman about car lettering;
    most of the current stuff is techy, wide sans, and compared to the elegant and
    expressive script logos from the 50's-70's, it's boring. Commuting on 101 gives
    us an eyeful, and the most interesting logo we saw the whole time was Nubira by
    Daewoo. Stephen, thanks for sharing that link! I may add some pics soon."

    you might like this logo if you can find a better rendition.\r\nhttp://auta5p.car.cz/muzea/automuseum_praga_2000/muzeum.htm\r\n\r\nThere
    is a strange P in the Peugeot logos in the link posted by Richard, was that a
    common letter in turn of the century French script (like the backward F)?\r\n\r\nTim"
