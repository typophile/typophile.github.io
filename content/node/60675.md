  it's a monospaced font. The lowercase 'r' seems to be the identifier.\r\n\r\nPlease
  post links to view / purchase if you can identify it. \r\n\r\nCheers![img:sites/default/files/old-images/uppercase_6427.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/lowercase_6369.jpg]"

  body: it is close to Simple, but the lowercase 'r' is slightly different. Even some
    of the CAPS are different. It seems that in the sample above, the Cap 'R', for
    instance, has rounded terminals.
