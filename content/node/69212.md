  context of an infinite amount of combinations. Practically every person on the earth
  benefits from those years of training, the months or years invested in the creation
  a typeface, each letter carefully wrought by hand, and yet\u2026\r\n\r\nThe world
  yawns.\r\n\r\nI hate that."

    reasons, rather than for the big audience. The important thing for me is that
    graphic designers like my work. They are the ones who often make beautiful things
    with typefaces. '

    while going to real work with salaries and stuff. And while unemployed. I just
    kept doing it. And it was worth it.\r\n\r\nStill is."

    your typeface - only means you've done your job well.\r\nIt <em>should</em> appear
    both effortless and obsequious.(IMHO)\r\nIf you're saying that you feel under-appreciated,
    that's another matter entirely.\r\nEat something, you'll feel better. ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow! I never thought of comparing Malkovich to fonts.\r\n\r\nFor the record,
    this isn't about my fonts, per se. It's when I see a design, or read a book, or
    see something on tv where the typeface IS the art, the typeface IS the real \"star\",
    but only I recognize it.\r\n\r\nI've seen designs on posters or billboards with
    such exquisite typography that I just sit and look at it, while others just wonder
    why I'm so crazy."

    who does really tiny paintings that art gallery patrons view though magnifying
    glasses.

  body: "The sewage/drainage system is an amazingly intricate and well-thought-out
    system and piece of engineering, invisibly making sure that every apartment in
    every building in our cities can easily and cleanly get rid of the sewage that
    just a few generations ago was spilled into open canals. We laymen can't even
    imagine the stink of centuries gone by as we conveniently pull the flush. Only
    when something starts to leak do we maybe realize that some thought went into
    making it all work, invisibly, under the surface, to make our lives easier. Only
    if a pipe breaks do we notice the smell.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm not saying type is shit.
    :-) I'm saying there's a graceful, silent beauty in doing a job that remains invisible
    to many but works its magic mostly hidden under the \"radar\" of conscious appreciation.
    (It may help to regard type less as an \"artform\" and rather as a tool that can
    help people achieve results.)"

    meant to be invisible and well engineered like plumbing, but others are meant
    to be more like a chandelier, something to add charm to the room."

    so that today's curators heavily rely on the quality and character of a master
    work - and then place a name to the work. \r\n\r\nI never seen that - humility
    - from the designer of fonts / typefaces. Even the crappiest clumsiest fonts have
    'pride' written all over them - replete with bio photo and portfolio and the much
    beloved eula.\r\n\r\nBang on that drum! Make it known - narcissism lives!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
