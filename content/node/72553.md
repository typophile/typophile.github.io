  who work next door to me. They outsourced a designer many moons ago who didn't tell
  them which font they've used and they've asked me to try and trace it so they can
  update workgear, etc.\r\n\r\nThe logo's in the image from below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.protenservices.co.uk/images/main/proten-services-logo.png?1197468404\r\n\r\nI've
  came close with a couple of searches I've done, namely with Priori Sans Regular,
  but there are slight differences in the way the letters are constructed and no slants
  on the bottoms of the letters. I'm absolutely certain this font exists somewhere.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks to anyone who tries to find it.\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: Other than the e--which is really kinda funky--this logo probably started
    life as Futura or one of its analogues, to which a little surgery was applied
    to the terminals...

  body: As Nick said. The lower terminals were evidently cut. And the e is from a
    different typeface (if not altogether constructed).
