  body: I think it&#39;s a &#40;somewhat badly&#41; hand-drawn riff on Bodoni Book.
    I&#39;m not familiar with any Bodoni variants that have the single serif on the
    &#39;c&#39;, and if one did exist, I&#39;d expect it to have more weight than
    the one shown here &#40;cf the &#39;s&#39;&#41;.
