body: Hello, I'm wanting to enhance by collection of printing specimen books but have
  no idea where to get them from other than lucky finds at bookstores etc.  Are there
  any websites that sell such books?

    their inventory tends to command premium prices.\r\n\r\nYou can\u2014if you are
    patient and persistent\u2014find good deals on eBay; however, please note that
    even patience and persistence are no guarantee that you will find what you're
    looking for at a price you're willing to pay.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I
    was building my collection of specimen books via the eBay method, I often bought
    duplicates simply because the price was too good to pass up. To paraphrase Aretha:
    \"What you want, maybe I got it.\" Or maybe not\u2026"

  body: "Amazon.com and its international brethren are a great way to get them cheap.
    Use terms vaguely similar to what you want and dig through page after page of
    search results and you can sometimes find incorrectly listed books for 2 or 3
    times less than what they sell for on eBay.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that some stuff
    is much harder to find than other stuff. ATF and Monotype are easy to get because
    so many books were made. Pre-WII European stuff can be very hard to find, and
    small/obscure European foundries are really tough. The best thing to look for
    are large-format specimen binders from typesetting shops. I have a set of specimens
    like this that is just amazing; hundreds of foundry types, printed as complete
    alphabets in every available size."

    expensive books unless you have solid knowledge that they are  worth the money.
    Those Alphabet Thesaurus books have some cool stuff in them, but the bulk of the
    content is artificially condensed/extended/slanted versions of common typefaces.
    Unless you absolutely must have the PLINC specimens, there are better options
    for your money. Likewise, a 1923 ATF specimen can be had for $100 and contains
    most of the better fonts that appear in the much more expensive 1912 Book."

  body: "@Dunwich Type\r\n\r\nThe value of an item is not what you pay for it, but
    what it's worth to you. For me, the PLINC catalog is worth $250.00; so what I
    paid for it reflects an incredible value.\r\n\r\nThe 1912 American Specimen Book
    of Type Styles is larger\u2014at 1301 numbered pages vs. 1148 for the 1923 edition\u2014and
    contains typefaces and other material simply not found in the later edition. Again,
    the value is determined by what the difference is worth to an individual. I have
    two 1923 specimen books: one is in excellent condition; the other, not so much,
    but I got it for $50.00. I also have the 1912 edition in very good condition,
    which I got at auction on eBay for 1912 for $125.00. As a reference book, I think
    that it's easily worth twice what I paid for it. Just sayin'\u2026"
