  know what exactly I would use it for, or how to learn about how to use it.\r\n"

  body: "\"Mastering\" is a term that different people probably use slightly differently,
    but in my view it involves everything that means turning a typeface design into
    a shipping font. \r\n\r\nChecking of the quality of outlines and their compatibility
    with requirements of font format specification can be seen as \"mastering\" though
    most people consider it a part of the design process. \r\n\r\nDepending on one's
    perspective, writing code for OpenType Layout features can be seen as \"design\"
    or \"mastering\", since some people consider OpenType Layout as much as essential
    part of the design decision-making process as spacing and kerning, while others
    consider it more akin to hinting. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, hinting can be seen as
    making design decisions, but is more likely to fall into the \"mastering\" category.
    \r\n\r\nOther typical elements of \"mastering\" include checking and fixing of:
    Unicode encoding, glyph naming, glyph ordering, family naming, linespacing consistency,
    as well as lots of other technical parameters such as embedding settings, version
    records, Panose information, and it some cases some additional technical parts.
    \r\n\r\nMastering is often tied directly to quality assurance (testing and proofing).
    \r\n\r\nCurrently, one universal checklist for all these aspects does not exist.
    But tools such as FontLab Studio along with the FontQA plugin, Adobe FDK (especially
    compareFamily but also other tools of the package), Microsoft FontValidator, Area51,
    FeatureProof, Microsoft VOLT & VTT, and DTL OTMaster can all be useful in the
    process of mastering. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    cut then used to create the stamps from which the final product appears.

  body: "Dunwich, thanks! This is a great list.\r\n\r\nI have some questions for you.
    Sorry there are so many.\r\n\r\n1. What do you mean by \"final production directories\"?\r\n2.
    What is an \"interpolated instance\"? ( I keep trying to find out what exactly
    interpolation means in font design, and I still have no idea.)\r\n3. \"Generate
    kern files for instances\"?\r\n4. \"Dekink interpolated instances with RMX harmonizer\"?
    What does this mean, and what if I can't afford that app? Is there another way
    to do it?\r\n5. What's an \"interpolated font\"?\r\n6. What do you mean by \"flat
    font\"? I know what decompose is, though.\r\n7. What are \"glyph indices\"?\r\n8.
    What do you mean by \"test final proof\"?\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your help.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and thanks to twardoch too! Now I understand what mastering is. I just need to
    make sure that I do all of the right things, and do them correctly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>1. What do you mean by \"final production directories\"?</em>\r\n\r\nMy
    font outlines make extensive use of overlaps and composite characters. Before
    I can use them to produce final fonts I have to break down many composite characters
    and remove the overlaps. To keep these \u201Cflat\u201D files from getting mixed
    up with my original files I put them into their own directories.\r\n\r\n<em>2.
    What is an \"interpolated instance\"? ( I keep trying to find out what exactly
    interpolation means in font design, and I still have no idea.)</em>\r\n\r\nAn
    interpolated instance is a font that was interpolated from two or more master
    fonts. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii9WSPFll7M\">Watch Erik's video
    for an explanation.</a>\r\n\r\n<em>3. \"Generate kern files for instances\"?</em>\r\n\r\nI
    do my kerning in Metrics Machine and interpolate in Superpolator. I use Metrics
    Machine to export the interpolated kerning from my Superpolator UFO files to an
    AFDKO-compatible feature file that can be compiled into final fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>4.
    \"Dekink interpolated instances with RMX harmonizer\"? What does this mean, and
    what if I can't afford that app? Is there another way to do it?</em>\r\n\r\nRemix
    Harmonizer is part of Tim Ahrens Font Remix suite of tools. It's sort of like
    1000-grit wet sandpaper for bezier curves. It can automatically fix \u201Ckinks\u201C,
    which are funky math problems that occur in bezier curves as a result of batch
    processes, including interpolation. Basically, it fixes a lot of wonky little
    details that would take me hours to find and correct manually. \r\n\r\n<em>5.
    What's an \"interpolated font\"?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's the same thing as the interpolated
    instance described above.\r\n\r\n<em>6. What do you mean by \"flat font\"? I know
    what decompose is, though.</em>\r\n\r\nA flat font is a flat with <em>no</em>
    overlaps.\r\n\r\n<em>7. What are \"glyph indices\"?</em>\r\n\r\nEach glyph has
    a index number that orders it within the font. For some reason this is the default
    order for the glyph palette in Adobe apps. Because I do not add glyphs to fonts
    in a logical order I sort them to match my logically-sorted encoding files.\r\n\r\n<em>8.
    What do you mean by \"test final proof\"?</em>\r\n\r\nI have a final test proof
    file that I use to make sure everything prints correctly in Indesign. "

  body: "Sorry for taking so long to thank you again Dunwich! I got super busy with
    some projects.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for all your guidance.\r\n\r\nOkay that
    video you posted really helped me understand what that Superpolator is used for.
    It must be great to have when you want to generate different weights of your font.
    Unfortunately I can't afford it right now, so I'll have to rely on FontLab to
    help me with that for now. Same with RMX Harmonizer. That sounds great too. So
    does Metrics Machine. I wish I had all three.\r\n\r\nOh yeah the glyph panel in
    Illustrator, InDesign, etc. I'll take a look at how my glyphs are laying out in
    it and rearrange their order. If I can figure out exactly how, that is.\r\n\r\nOkay
    I understand everything you mean now.\r\n\r\nThanks a million! You're the best
    Dunwich."
