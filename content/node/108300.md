  blog, we're making him a birthday present and it would be awesome if I could make
  him a card in a similar style. I would ask him what font he used, but it's supposed
  to be a surprise.\r\n\r\nTried a couple of websides that help with font identification,
  came up with nothing. You're my only hope ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3862.png]"

  body: I also found some more worlds written in this font. Apparently the "i" have
    a strange type of dotting. Maybe this will help in IDing the font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_6078.jpg]
