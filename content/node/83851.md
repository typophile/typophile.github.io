body: In a script font, where all caps use is a massive no-no, would it make more
  sense for the AE glyph to be Ae, same with OE going to Oe?  I'm thinking of doing
  it, not even as alternates but as the main glyph, since nobody would ever use AE
  or OE in anything other than an all caps setting...  Or would they?

  body: "From my understanding, \xC6 is meant to be its own character just like /A/
    or /E/ or any other letter. Hence the reason why it's common to find /AE/ and
    not /Ae/, since it is treated as a single letter and not two different letters
    (as in the case of /f_i/ or most other ligatures).\r\n\r\nBut I may have the wrong
    understanding so don't quote me on this."

  body: "No, upside down M ;-)\r\n\r\nOk, point taken, but I might do Ae and Oe as
    alternates.  In other threads I've seen the French sometimes use Oe.  I've found
    previous - Deliscript by Alphabet Soup and a lot of Nick's Fonts do it.  Just
    struggling with AE at the moment..."

  body: "Yeah, I think OE/AE is much more legible. There's also something to be said
    about languages like Danish, which use \xE6 as a letter, you can't use the non-ligature
    version, because it represents different sounds. So it's always \xC6."

  body: One last thing... Hrant, would you name the new letters Ae and Oe or A_e and
    O_e?  And does it even matter?

  body: "As I mentioned very recently in another thread, many years ago I had this
    same idea! An \"Ae\" (and \"Oe\") \"ligature\" makes great sense, and not just
    in a script face. Tradition, shmradition. And languages need to constantly improve,
    just like everything else.\r\n\r\nLet me try to dig up the sketches I did back
    then...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sure you can do Ae and Oe ligatures if you want. They would be contextual
    ligatures and you can name them A_e/O_e. Just don't put them in the slots named
    AE and OE. Those are distinct letters of certain alphabets and cannot be replaced
    by a non-ligature version, nor by an uppercase-lowercase mix like Ae/Oe. That's
    like writing \u201CWater\u201D in this way: Vvater. \r\n"
