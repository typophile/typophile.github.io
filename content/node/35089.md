  body: "\r\n\r\nDon't forget that Reid Miles made those classic Blue Note designs
    during the 1950 and 1960'ies....  and they were not made with a computer! and
    I like when he cut up the letters..  like for instance Kenny Dorham's album from
    1964 \"Trompeta Toccata\". Blue Note 4181\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dorham_kenn_trompetat_101b_4088.jpg]"
