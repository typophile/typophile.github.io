  body: How do you pronounce 'Fontesque'? Based on the spelling I would say 'Font-esk'
    (as in desk), and for 'Fortescue' I would say 'For-tes-cue' (as in the stick used
    in billiards).

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nWhen we originally set out about naming the font, we looked
    and couldn't find anything. We must of missed it!\r\n\r\nThe name actually refers
    to 'Earl Fortescue' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Fortescue\r\nThis is due
    to the typeface originally being created for an artist who resided at Fortescue
    House (The House in Devon in which Earl Fortescue lived).\r\n\r\nAgain, as hrant
    says, they look completely different, it just happens to be a coincidence about
    the names sounding similar.\r\n\r\n- Colophon"
