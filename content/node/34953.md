  body: "I know what you're saying..   Im sure this is made by a high profile agency,
    they shouldve at least cleaned up the kerning, secondly a high profile agency
    using freeware fonts would be rather strange..\r\n\r\nseems like the biggest kerning
    prob is after the e, maybe they edited an exhisting font (seems like a condensed
    alternate gothic) and messed up the kerning while editing the e or something.."
