  body: "Thanks Poms, was a case of finding which foundry had made oldstyle figures
    available in Gill/Humanist as opposed to how to utilise them as I already have
    poor old Quark's glyph palette taking up far too much room on my monitor!\r\n\r\nFound
    the monotype release at www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/gill_sans_pro_book/
    which may fit the bill which I'll have a look into later.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: 'Interesting - didn''t know that a "Pro" version (with old style numerals
    and small caps) of the good old Gill Sans was available. But a question comes
    to mind: was the original metal typeface designed by Eric Gill and released by
    Monotype in late 1920s available with old style numerals? I don''t think I have
    seen them anywhere before.'

  body: "I have a <em>Scotsman</em> calendar from the 1930s set in Gill with the oldstyle
    figures.\r\nI don't have it in front of me, but I suspect that the digital oldstyle
    figures aren't exactly the same: the one and zero may have been \"improved\".
    But I do like the 3 and 5!"

  body: 'I had a quick look at Brinhgurst this morning and he wrote that Gill Sans
    old style figures were produced "privately" and not by Monotype. Martin Majoor,
    in his site (http://www.martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html), states that "Eric
    Gill never made them for his Gill Sans (although in the 1990s they were added
    by Monotype)". So: if neither Gill nor Monotype designed them, who made them?'
