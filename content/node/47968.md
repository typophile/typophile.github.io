  you did not use VOLT before and want to try it now, you will have to join [[http://groups.msn.com/MicrosoftVOLTuserscommunity|Microsoft
  VOLT users community]]. Download link and release notes are available on version
  history page.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Microsoft VOLT 1.3.254
  release notes</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Overview</em>\r\n\r\nSince last public VOLT release
  two years ago, we have added various features and made improvements across the entire
  product. Here is quick list of changes, followed by detailed description:\r\n\r\n
  \ -\tFont explorer, allowing users to quickly search for glyph references inside
  lookups.\r\n  -\tUsability improvements, including lookup comments, new UI options
  and detailed error messages.\r\n  -\tCompilation improvements in quality, compatibility,
  and performance.\r\n  -\tOverall performance improvements, including import, export,
  and font size.\r\n  -\tUpdated supplemental files and tags list.\r\n  -\tMultiple
  bug fixes across VOLT including the compiler, project import and export and across
  the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Font Explorer</em>\r\n\r\nFont Explorer allows font designer
  to instantly search project lookups for any appearance of the glyph, wherever it
  referenced directly or as part of glyph group. Users may also search for a sequence
  of glyphs. Search can be controlled by several parameters in the Explorer window.
  \r\n\r\nFrom search results, a font developer can quickly jump to a particular line
  inside a lookup input or context. This can be done by Ctrl-clicking on the corresponding
  line in the search results. By Alt-clicking on a lookup or group name, user can
  open the corresponding lookup or glyph group. When user clicks on glyph name, VOLT
  will jump to glyph definition inside glyph editor. Same Alt-Click is also enabled
  in the lookup window (inside both input or context fields).\r\n\r\nFont Explorer
  can be accessed by clicking 'Explore' button on the toolbar or from Tools menu.\r\n\r\n<em>Lookup
  comments</em>\r\n\r\nFont designers can now add comments to each lookup in font
  project. If one of comment lines starts with \u201CTODO:\u201D, it is considered
  special to-do item for this lookup. Lookup comments can be added from lookup window
  menu.\r\n\r\n<em>Main window</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nMain window now supports view options
  allowing the display of detailed information about lookups and glyph groups right
  inside main project window. Lookup list can also display lookup content, comments,
  or to-do action items. Glyph group can show group content. View options can be controlled
  from the redesigned options dialog.\r\n\r\nVOLT now remembers main form size and
  position, view options, and font sizes used in other VOLT windows. Overall form
  layout had changed, giving more space to lookup and group lists. Feature tree opens
  in compact state, with lookup lists collapsed by default.\r\n\r\n<em>Project improvements</em>\r\n\r\nPerformance
  is significantly improved for project compilation, loading and saving. It is now
  several times or even tens of times faster on complex fonts. Font file size is also
  improved by avoiding keeping intermediate compilation tables.\r\n\r\nOption had
  been added to avoid overwriting the cmap table from VOLT, allowing cmap editing
  by other font tool like FontLab.\r\n\r\nSupport had been added for FontLab glyph
  syntax in lookups and the proofing tool. \u2018/\u2019 is now allowed as a separator
  between glyph along with space and comma, enabling simple copy-paste from FontLab.\r\n\r\nDetailed
  error messages for various problems with project import and editing have been added.\r\n\r\n<em>Compilation</em>\r\n\r\nDetailed
  error messages added for some compilation errors and invalid project sources.\r\n\r\nMaximum
  number of components per ligature is increased from 6 to 16.\r\n\r\nVertical form
  substitution features \u2018vert\u2019 and \u2018vrt2\u2019 are compiled in a way
  that is compatible with GDI.\r\n\r\n<em>Other changes</em>\r\n\r\nUpdated usp10.dll
  and sample fonts to versions shipped with Windows Vista SP1.\r\n\r\nTags.txt file
  updated, including recently added features and the new Indic v.2 tags .\r\n\r\nKern2Volt
  updated to support longer glyph names (up to 255 characters).\r\n\r\nMultiple bug
  fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good point :). I was just announcing new version of the tool, assuming people
    know what it is. \r\n\r\nVOLT is a free tool released by Microsoft allowing font
    designers to develop OpenType layout features. It is widely used by people creating
    fonts with complex layout logic, especially fonts for complex scripts.\r\n\r\nYou
    can read more about it on [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx|Microsoft
    VOLT home page]].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
