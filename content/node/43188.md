body: I feel especially silly asking about this because about a month ago I figured
  out how to do this. It seems to me that either Fontlab or maybe Font Explorer had
  a feature that would export all glyphs in a font into a unicode text file. Maybe
  it's yet a third app. In any event if you recall & can remind me I will be most
  grateful. Thanks!

    have to know the number of glyphs in your font, and then write an InDesign Tagged

    some unencoded glyphs in InD via the glyph palette, export to tagged text and
    look at it in a text editor to figure out how it's done exactly.\r\n\r\nHm, come

    of the script, created with the kind help of www.hilfdirselbst.ch (swiss user-to-user
    support site). It inserts all glyphs of a Font to a new text frame in Indesign
    CS3. The glyphs do not need to be encoded with a unicode point.\r\n\r\nWhat the
    script does: create a text frame with as much \" \" inserted as the font has glyphs
    as \"search dummies\". Start a search and replace script, searching for \" \"
    and replacing it with i+1 glyph number each time it finds one.\r\nIt is done per
    \"search and replace\" as it does not seem to be possible to directly access Glyphs
    per GID to insert them into a textframe, but it works per glyph search to replace
    them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne have to adjust:\r\n- 2 times Font-Family name und weight
    (separated per Tabulator: \"Times New Roman[TAB]Regular\")\r\n- choose the same
    font as default setting in your Indesign document to be sure it works. I think
    as it is not specified in the script, this is necessary.\r\n- insert the glyph
    count of the font in the line \"var glyphenzahl = 1234;\"\r\n- \"var startGlyphID=1\":
    the GID of the \"space\" glyph of your font. Any other unicoded(!) glyph can be
    used as well, but be sure to read the next line if you do this!\r\n- in the line
    \"aStory.insertionPoints[-1].contents = ' '\" the same glyph has to be inserted
    as specified in \"startGlyphID\" (i.E. if you have inserted the GID of the space
    character above, you have to enter a space here. These have to correspond, otherwise
    it won't work.)\r\n\r\nThis can be optimised for sure, but it works quite well
    for Adobes Garamond Premier Pro and for some of my fonts I was building it for.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this is useful to some of you. Don't hesitate to improve it... I am a scripting
    noob, so there for sure is space for optimization."
