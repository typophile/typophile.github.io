  body: I don&#39;t know what it is, but it looks like it was inspired by the lettering
    of Ben Shahn.

  body: Yeah, Mark, you are on a roll. <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html"
    target="_blank">Harold Lohner</a> has a couple of Ben Shahn -inspired fonts on
    his site called Bens Folk and Bens Folk condensed. They are not identical to this,
    but you have to compare letters to be sure. The feeling is still the same, but
    without all the bounce. &#40;You have to select &#34;Famous Artists&#34; from
    the navigation frame to see them, as I can&#39;t get a specific link to the fonts&#41;.

  body: Good suggestion Dan. Their <a href="http://www.astigmatic.com/gargamel.html"
    target="_blank">&#34;Gargamel&#34;</a> is similar, and I guess we can assume the
    baseline bounce is in the typesetting, not the font design.

    <BR> <BR>Yes, I would agree with Mr. Mike Yanega, the baseline bounce must not
    result from the font design, taking the fact that same letters don&#39;t come
    in the same position, &#40;same situation with the sample above&#41;, so I suppose
    the positioning of each letter is indeed random, and not resulting from the font
    design in itself. <BR> <BR>Also, in my tries to identify this one, I too have
    come to an other AOE&#39;s font: Lord Rat &#40; <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/lord-rat-aoe/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/lord-rat-aoe/</a> &#41;
    Not quite it, either, though... <BR>'

    instead of directly linking it to the text, as I see everyone here doing, but,
    I don&#39;t actually know how that is supposed to be done?... :-P
