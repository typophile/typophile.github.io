  body: "It should be relatively easy to make letters that resemble GiraGira letters.
    Find a suitable base font. This would be a monoline sans with rounded ends that
    has somewhat similar letters, for example [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SimpliciterSansMedInUse_6531.jpg]\r\nadjust
    widths and other characteristics where needed, and edit strokes on the distinctive
    letters, such as _R_, _E_, _A_, _K_,  and _Y_, plus the additional letters shown
    at the website.\r\nTo get a matching weight to GiraGira I did a 50-50 blend of
    Simpliciter Sans Regular and Simpliciter Sans Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cercurius/simpliciter-sans/\r\nThe
    GiraGira letters seem to have been produced by a Dutch designer, while Simpliciter
    Sans is by a Swede. Some searching might reveal a base font that is a closer match.
    \r\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the letters form part of a company name. There may be
    legal issues in using exact copies.\r\nDon\r\np.s. Go to the company website and
    find out some fascinating information on track racing bikes. Don't miss the parts
    FAQ. The company seems to be interested in international sales, they take payment
    in US$, Euro, British Pound, Canadian $, and Australian $."
