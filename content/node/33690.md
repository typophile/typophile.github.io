body: "Hello,\r\nInteresting in knowing what are your current favorites for contemporary
  (humanist, geometric, or gothic) san-serif typefaces might be.  Usage could be anything,
  but primarily wondering what faces you've purchased in the last 3 or so years that
  you like and why.\r\n\r\nHere's mine:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bryant Pro: Nice contemporary
  friendly face. Very clean on and off screen\r\n\r\n\u2022 Galaxy Polaris: Great
  workhorse for the studio, but a little limited. Basically our helvetica.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Stratum: Good ultra modern font, that straddles a nice line between ultra-tech but
  not overly so.\r\n\r\nFeel free to broaden the criteria for selection.  \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like, amongst others, in no particular order:\r\n\r\n- Klavika - Nice modern
    squarish sans\r\n- Legato - Good for both text and larger use, very large family\r\n-
    Fedra Sans - Especially nice when combined with Fedra Serif.\r\n- Locator - No
    special reason.\r\n- Engel - More friendly then Klavika.\r\n- Sansa (+ Soft) -
    Just pure genius, imo. ;)\r\n- Fresco Sans - Works well for body text (and then
    there's the serif that goes with it.)\r\n- Quadraat Sans  - Same as Fresco Sans.\r\n\r\nNot
    specifically typefaces I bought, but these came to mind right now. There are more
    that I like of course, but it's too late now to type more. :)"

    some more recent favorites:\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=amplitude\">Amplitude</a></strong>
    by [[Christian Schwartz]]\r\nAfter three years, it's still my favorite workhorse.
    Amplitude looks right in almost any setting \u2014 clean and readable at text
    sizes, vibrant and powerful in headlines. With an inktrapless version and italics
    on the way, soon you'll be able to use Amplitude for anything.\r\n\r\n<strong><a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_strada_text/\">FF Strada</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_strada_condensed/\">FF
    Strada Condensed</a></strong> by [[Albert Pinggera]]\r\nIts warm curves can make
    it friendly if it needs to be, but you can use it to set serious text too. Wonderfully
    readable at small sizes, unique detail when large. One of few contemporary typefaces
    drawn by an Italian.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/\">Maquette</a></strong>
    by [[Angus Shamal]]\r\nA new large x-heighted alternative in the grotesque style
    of [[Gotham]] and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Proxima%20Nova\">Proxima
    Nova</a>."
