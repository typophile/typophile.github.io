  body: "Reminded me a bit of the Richie Brothers logo. In which the the 'rb\" resembles
    a tractor (they sell/auction farm equipment).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ritchie-Bros_5496.-Logo1.jpg]"

  body: "I've heard that style referred to as a \"ribbon\" look, with shadows where
    pieces cross. \r\n\r\nOf course a real ribbon can't be bent into a shape like
    that, but there is a resemblance. QVC (a tv shopping network) uses a similar effect
    with their Q, and I'm sure there are many other examples.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qvc2_5392.jpg]"
