    clean.\r\nEven one of my favorites by A.M. Cassandre -- <a href=\"http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/France_Pages/France_13/nordexpress.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Nord Express</a>.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Nord Express poster by Cassandre
    is this one, which was not included on the site --\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NORDEXPRESS-1927_6279.jpg]\r\n(Actually,
    many of the other posters outclass Cassandre's by far.)"
