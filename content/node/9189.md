body: 'What filemaker gurus do we have here? Does anyone want to help us streamline
  our Typophile back-end database? <BR> <BR>I need to know how to use Filemaker to
  parse text out of one field into multiple fields, as shown: <BR> <BR>A field containing:
  <BR> <BR>1. Jared Benson <BR>2. <a href="mailto:benson@typophile.com">benson@typophile.com</a>
  <BR>3. Hello <BR> <BR>Would parse into: &#40;field names are shown in bracketts&#41;
  <BR> <BR>[Firstname] Jared <BR>[Lastname] Benson <BR>[Email] <a href="mailto:benson@typophile.com">benson@typophile.com</a>
  <BR>[Quote] hello <BR> <BR>It would seem that there&#39;d be a way to select text
  between &#34;1.&#34; and &#34;2.&#34; and then use the Copy/Paste scripts to paste
  into the appropriate field.  <BR> <BR>Any help?'

    to txt, delete the 1. 2. 3., change tthem tab, then re-import, something like
    that. <BR> <BR>Clive Bruton from FontZone is the right guy for any FM stuff, he

  body: 'It&#39;s pretty tricky, especially if all the entry isn&#39;t there as you
    have it, ie it goes: <BR> <BR>1 Jared <BR>2 <a href="mailto:Benson@.">Benson@..</a>.
    <BR>3 hello <BR> <BR>or <BR> <BR>1 jared <BR>3 hello <BR> <BR>or if it&#39;s in
    a different order. <BR> <BR>I would personally go down the route of creating a
    calc field, trying to delimit that data appropriately, then export it and import
    to a new database - perhaps use a relationship/lookup to populate fields in the
    old database. <BR> <BR>FM&#39;s text processing is pretty poor, so don&#39;t bother
    yourself trying to script it to parse text. <BR> <BR>You could try it via AppleScript,
    but I think the calc method would be better.'
