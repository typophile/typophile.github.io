    designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Calvert|Margaret Calvert]]
    in 1980 and it's based on  letters originally drawn for the signage system of
    the Tyne and Wear Metro system in Newcastle, UK. She was also featured in Top
    Gear UK Series in the year 2009 and you may see the video [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QypmXbwD1k
    | here]], quiet interesting video I must say.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSB  "
