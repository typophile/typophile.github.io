  body: When I first saw this thread, I did a search for the keyword "shadow" on MyFonts
    and Horndon did not come up... Now I see that this face has no keywords assigned
    to it on MyFonts -- strange.

    Which anyone, which is interested, can do, btw. \r\n\r\nJust fill in the form
    at <em>MyFonts Keywords: none [suggest]</em>."

    add some keywords, but something went wrong when I entered my username and password,
    and I wasn't able to move forward. But thanks for the tip!"

  body: "And hold on a second! I just went back to MyFonts and found two versions
    of Horndon.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/horndon/\"><strong>Elsner+Flake
    version</strong></a> has a couple of keywords... It's the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horndon/\"><strong>Linotype
    version</strong></a> that has none."
