  community! Our instructor directed us here and I\u2019ve actually gathered a great
  deal of information just reading in the forums. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve definitely moved
  a to a more confident feeling of my own designs, and I wanted to get some critique
  on my own personal logo that I will be using for my own freelance work. \r\n\r\nThis
  is the first work I\u2019ve actually posted beyond the critique outside my own peers
  and instructors, and I am definitely looking forward to getting some feedback on
  it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cadlogo.jpg]"

  body: Odd colors. Hierarchy is not as it should be. That spacing between charles
    and askew is too big. Why do you start with a more formal approach? Then abstract
    it from there.

  body: I would look at stacking your title. It might be able to be justified. I would
    look at other type faces and look at all caps since you have only one character
    that has a decender the lower case g. I don't mind the mark but you might explore
    how it works in one color. A good designer solves design problems such as one
    color printing.

  body: "i never like it when people use the word \"designs\". pluralizing the word
    makes you seem smaller and in my opinion cheapens your services and waters down
    your potential. it's like you're making widgets or something.\r\n\r\nusing the
    term \"design\" implies a bigger thought process and a broader approach.\r\n\r\ni'd
    say this applies to \"communications/communication\" as well."

  body: Or maybe not use these words at all. Question is how can YOU stand out?

  body: "<strong>Without the title, the mark falls apart a bit.</strong> The order
    of the letterforms aren't easily discernable, and the \"D\" can easily be interpreted
    as an \"O\" because the reversed \"D\" opens up into the counter of the \"C.\"
    \r\n\r\n<strong>Give greater thought to the type that makes up your title.</strong>
    It seems like you typed in your title without considering modifications. Remember
    you have complete control over letter placement and each one of the individual
    characters that make up your title. Futura could be a nice starting point, but
    now consider how to improve upon it, making it unique to your logo.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you don't need a separate mark at all. Have you considered a wordmark? \r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n"
