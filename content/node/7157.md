body: I&#39;m working on a 64 pixel bitmapped Dingbat and when generated from FOG
  it shows up nicely in suitcase &#40;Mac, osX, at work.&#41; but it doesn&#39;t appear
  in the typeface drop-down menu in Illustrator or Quark, it works in Photoshop and
  it sort of works in Quark if I type the name in the textfield. Any ideas? It works
  nicely on my old Powerbook wallstreet running os9.2 at home.
