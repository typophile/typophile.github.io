  body: j <BR> <BR>This is exciting... I had not heard about that project yet, but
    it looks promising. Champaign/Urbana and the University need more people advocating
    art and culture in this area of the midwest. There is a lot of opportunity here

    easily get looked over. <BR> <BR>Congratulations and good luck!  <BR> <BR>r.k
