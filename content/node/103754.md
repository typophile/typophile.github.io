    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/eagle|Eagle]] but the rest is truly off. So part
    of providing a better sample or more information, it could be quite impossible

  body: "Thanks anyway Ryluk.\r\n\r\nIt looks more similar to  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-dirty-7/|Dirty
    seven]] to me, but with C/D/G more rounded and stretched. Your G is more similar,
    of course.\r\n\r\nMaybe with that image is more easy to find it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rim-campaign-font_6054.jpg]"
