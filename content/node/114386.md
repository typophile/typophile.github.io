  body: "> Is Fallon the show?\r\n> Or, does The Tonight Show have any brand strength
    of its own?\r\n\r\nThe brand strength is mainly with older viewers who've watched
    the show for years with various hosts.\r\n\r\nJay Leno consistently had good ratings,
    but the median age of his viewers was 56.  (Letterman's median viewer age is 54.)
    That's why NBC pushed Leno out; they're hoping that a younger host will bring
    younger viewers that are more desirable to advertisers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Tonight Show ain't fun at all. It's rather lame, limp and stale ...failing flat.
    \r\n\r\nIs Fallon the show? \r\n\r\nOr, does The Tonight Show have any brand strength

    what they did for NYC's street signage ...in fact the street signage may just
    have a little more life to it ... http://new.pentagram.com/2013/01/new-work-new-york-city-parking-signs/"
