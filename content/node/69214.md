  posts for about an hour or two.\r\n\r\nIs this because of dinner(NY), leaving work
  (MI), leaving work early (CA), early lunch (NZ and AU) or pubs closing in England?\r\n\r\nOr
  is there some downtime thingy in Typophile maintenance?"

    pm is 12 pm in a huge swath of Europe: lunch time! Can't talk with our mouths
    full, can we? (In addition, it seems 'we' Europeans have no moral qualms about
    some browsing during work time, as it seems to pick up again <em>after</em> lunch.)\r\n\r\nThe
    Americans are still asleep at that time; perhaps the occasional Australian night-owl
    is still on-line."

    time. Many times this forum dies down about now (of course not today).'

    reasoning still possible? \"Everyone else gone to bed?\" Me, I'm a night-owl,
    much to the chagrin of my co-workers 'the next morning'."

    an hour ago.\r\n\r\nNow take a look."
