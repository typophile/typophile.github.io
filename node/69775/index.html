Coming up on the 1 year anniversary, I finally couldn&rsquo;t stand looking at the typographic travesty that is their logo. So I designed my own, and it&rsquo;s a solid, aesthetic replacement, if perhaps a bit bland.</p>
<p>I put together [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74838|this GreaseMonkey script]] that replaces the logo (and favicon) on bing.com and discoverbing.com. I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>I hate the bing logo. Yours could use a little work, as has been prior noted. But, all in all&hellip;I think the whole site stinks. So&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Well maybe then you shouldn&rsquo;t call the result a «solid, aesthetic replacement», and on Typophile at that.</p>
<p>BTW, the Bing &ldquo;g&rdquo; is not «ripped off from Kabel», it&rsquo;s simply following a similar basic structure, which is indeed named after Rudolf Koch (who drew Kabel). Many other fonts (most of which have nothing to do with Kabel) do too, in fact this structure is getting pretty hawt nowadays.</p>

<p>I spent some time studying Kabel, and in my opinion you are way off the mark. And I agree with Nina: a ½ hour work is really not worth to show on Typophile.</p>
<p>Looking at your logo: &lsquo;n&rsquo; looks best, but it does not sit with the other glyphs.</p>

<p>And, if one is familiar with these issues and knows what one is doing, one could do this <em>with</em> corrections within half an hour. The optical corrections at least at a basic level could be done in two to five minutes, starting with a vector logo. Seriously.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Most of the people criticizing have in fact designed typefaces. I&rsquo;ve done about 18,000 glyphs for Adobe, albeit all in one typeface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you went into the arena for the first time, and some experienced boxers watching pointed out afterwards that you need to actually punch with your left as well as your right. This is really basic stuff in type design that you haven&rsquo;t learned yet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been designing some commercial logos for my employer, in collaboration with our lead in-house graphic designer. It&rsquo;s been a great experience, because she has some fine ideas and we work together at that level, but she lacks any experience with exactly these sorts of optical correction issues, so I fix all those things along the way, and avoid at least one kind of complete logo failure that I see in the logos for, say, Bing and Nook.</p>
<p>By the way, another very specific point which I see in your re-design of Bing, as well as (for instance) the Nook logo: in order for your logo to <em>look</em> monoline (that is, the lines are all the same thickness), you need to make the horizontal parts slightly thinner than the vertical parts. This applies to the top and bottom of round shapes compared to the sides, as well. Even 5% difference may do the trick.</p>
