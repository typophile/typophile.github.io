body: "hello folks,\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt to the type design. It's still
  incomplete but I have taken a snapshot from the Illustrator just to show the idea.
  I need your feedback to improve on the design. Am facing problems designing few
  letters and thus your comments would be really helpful for me. Though at the moment
  am not satisfied with any of these letters. \r\n\r\nThe Idea was to combine both
  small and the capitals in one and thats why i've named it \"Capsmall\".\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nsatya,\r\nStudent, Graphic Design\r\nNational Institute of Design\r\nAhmedabad,

  body: First ask yourself, would each letter be legible if it was taken out of order?
    Put some of the glyphs together to form words because they never act alone, always
    as a cohesive group.

  body: "Satya, I think the letters are very fantasyful and decorating. Nice idea
    with combining caps and capitals.\r\n\r\nIt's a little more difficult to find
    a area of use for it, however, due to its decorative shapes. It feels they are
    more like a graphic design element than a typeface, if you know what I mean, but
    that is of course OK. I kind of like them. Keep going working on it.\r\nGoran\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw,
    Say Hello to India from me, I visited your country a couple of years ago and stayed
    for a couple of months \u2013 and really loved it."

  body: "Satya -\r\n\r\nThere's something really appealing about it, very graphic.
    I think you should persevere.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the forms which 'flow'
    into each other, such as 'b/B', 'p/P' and even 'u/U', rather than the ones which
    feel like one letterform is superimposed over another, like 'r/R' or 't/T', but
    that's just me.\r\n\r\nadrian"

  body: I like the way you play with letterforms. It might not be very useful in a
    way typefaces can be, but it looks great. Keep up the work, I wanna see more of
    this..

    there will be application for it.\r\n\r\nI am not sure all your solutions work,
    but some are marvels. I love the T/t and the S/s. dont think the R/r works at
    all, though.\r\n\r\nbtw, I was unable to view the offsite file. Thanks Miss Tiffany.\r\n\r\ngeo.\r\n"
