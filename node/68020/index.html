  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Cycles 11 for some time now, and I really like it, but there is something that bugs me. Whenever I type the € sign I get a /dyet/ sign (D with crossbar), which is a character in Serbo-Croatian (according to Bringhurst). There is a € sign in Cycles, which I now access through the Glyphs panel in Indesign. How can I change it so I get an € sign when I type it? (I&rsquo;m using the Mac PS version)</p>
<p>Another small thing is the ß in Cycles Smallcaps. In german the ß isn&rsquo;t used in allcaps setting, but replaced with SS. However Cycles smallcaps does not include this character, replacing it with something else. Can I make a simular adjustment to my typeface to replace ß with SS? I noticed that when I set Cycles 11 in allcaps it does make the SS out of ß.</p>
<p>I realise that for both of these questions I could use the search/replace function, but this has the disadvantage that when I would copy/paste texts from other programs or sources it would not show correctly, and if I decided to change typeface or case it would also need new adjustments. So another solution would be preffered.</p>
<p>Help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Jeffrey</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There certainly is a way for you to make the changes on your own, but as you’ve certainly licensed the typeface properly: Contact Sumner Stone before doing anything else. You want him to fix a bug, strictly speaking, and I think he is going to help you. That way, he avoids customers messing around with or, rather, in his fonts, and you can be sure that the problem is dealt with professionally. As far as my experience goes, most type designers are cooperative and quick when it comes to such issues.</p>
<p>Give it a try and let us know if you got what you wanted.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>I have been in contact with Mr. Stone before, and he&rsquo;s always been very friendly. I will write him a mail. I just thought that this may be a more general question as well which people might have dealt with before. There might have been easy ways to solve this, which I am not aware of. Bringhurt talks about remapping the keyboard, so I figured this might be the way to fix these problems. I agree with you that it&rsquo;s very nice getting into contact with the type designer, it sort of adds a human dimension to a typeface.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jeffrey — Sumner will probably welcome the attention to what sounds like a bug and fix it for you. Or he may authorize you to do it yourself. Either way, you’re covered and you’ve done right by the designer.</p>
<p>Looks like the Euro needs a proper Unicode encoding. The Small Caps doesn’t have anything encoded for ß, so I’m not sure what your software is inserting in its place.</p>
<p>These should be easy fixes, but always best done with the source files to regenerate sound fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just went &amp; looked. In PS Cycles 11, € is in the &ldquo;currency&rdquo; symbol position. Characters in Postscript Type 1 fonts are identified by name. I don&rsquo;t know the key sequence for &ldquo;currency&rdquo; on a Mac. Unicode for &ldquo;currency&rdquo; is is 00A4, perhaps your layout program would go &amp; get it if you enter that Unicode.</p>
<p>PostScript Type 1 fonts in OT-savvy programs do require some work. You&rsquo;ll just have to type two small-cap esses for the German double-s. There is often a significant amount of lying about character names in 8-bit fonts like PS-1.</p>
<p>Sumner has made OT versions of his fonts:</p>

<p>Whether or not he&rsquo;ll allow you to make up an OT version based on the glyphs in your PS-1 font is up to him.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Charles &amp; Kent,</p>
<p>I contacted Sumner Stone and he ackowledged that these were bugs, which he would fix for an updated version. Unfortunately I bought Cycles at MyFonts where they didn&rsquo;t offer an OT version. But the opentype versions don&rsquo;t have real opentype functionalities (smallcaps and other options are still in seperate fonts), but it seems the euro issue is resolved, at least in my OT Arepo version. He also told that the euro sign could be typed with the currency symbol, although unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been able to locate it until now&hellip;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go messing around with the font, as might break more than I would fix ;-)
And I&rsquo;ll just hope that mr. Stone will think about me when he issues a new version&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks again, Jeffrey</p>
