  body: "Pedro, I can see that you are right about it being a font, but there are
    too many hand-printed fonts to easily identify it. It would be simpler for you
    to find a similar font, and not look for this exact one. It would take luck to
    find it among the thousands of similar fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is a free font that is rather similar to your sample. Maybe it would work?\r\n\r\n-
