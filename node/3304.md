  elegant designs. Is there any merit in it?

  body: 'When I&#39;ve heard it from clients, usually there&#39;s merit in it, in
    that it implies that the client hasn&#39;t gotten what they want &#40;now, what
    they want is another matter&#42;&#41; and they have something specific in mind.
    Then I have to gently tease the answer from them. <BR> <BR>If a &#39;creative&#39;
    says it, then it usually means &#40;in my experience&#41; that they aren&#39;t
    good at their job or articulating what they should be able to articulate. <BR>
    <BR>With clients, I get it from people who almost inevitably say, &#34;I&#39;m
    not a very creative person. I mean, ::chuckle:: I can&#39;t even draw stick figures!&#34;
    They probably have a style they&#39;re aiming for, but don&#39;t know what it&#39;s
    called. <BR> <BR>For me, it always comes back to client-designer communication.
    I spend a lot of my time at meetings encouraging the client to speak freely and
    openly, and have faith that their ideas have merit, even if they only end up informing
    the solution &#40;rather than dictating it&#41;. They often end up surprising
    themselves, and end up liking something I&#39;ve done that they never would&#39;ve
    though of on their own, but feel they had a hand it creating. Does this get at
    what you&#39;re asking for? <BR> <BR>&#42;sometimes my clients like crap, then
    it&#39;s a matter of trying to give them the crap in a well-made package.'

  body: '&#62; Just round one of the corners.  <BR> <BR>ROTFL <BR> <BR>Or add a lot
    of layers for a decidedly 90s design-y look. <BR> <BR>I think Chris&#39; answer
    is excellent. Usually when you hear &#39;can you make it more designy&#39; comments,
    it&#39;s from somebody who has a mental picture of something they think is particularly
    well designed or impressively designed. Sometimes to &#39;gently tease the answer
    from them&#39; it&#39;s an exercise in doing something along the lines of &#39;Can
    you give me an example of something you think is particularly design-y?&#39; <BR>
    <BR>I have found asking in advance for examples of things that the client likes
    or is impressed with gives a good clue about their level of expectations. It also
    affords you the opportunity to do a little compare and contrast if you think they
    have set their sights low: &#39;If you like that, maybe you&#39;d like this even
    more &#40;shows a better example&#41;&#39;. <BR> <BR>A lot of people think design
    &#40;of anything&#41; is decoration, and when they see austerity, plainness, clean
    and sharp layouts, they get scared that the designer hasn&#39;t been designing
    enough. If you tend towards rigorous minimalism or austerity, you need to educate
    the client about how hard it is to get meaningfully simple. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: I usually combat any pretenses about design-eyness by throwing the marketing
    imput back at them. Things like Demographics, Income bring them back into focus.

    showed it to the marketing &amp; design company next door to them, to get some

  body: you can always rely on the old adage &#34;less is more.&#34; but as steve
    just pointed out, most people don&#39;t get that. One of our main advertisors
    feels like his ad is not effective unless he&#39;s covering every square milimeter
    with ink. <BR><a href="http://www.remindernews.com/WINSLOWAZNEWS/myarticles.asp?P=898877&amp;S=394&amp;PubID=12044"

    principles of art really should be a requirement for high school and college curriculums,
    but i&#39;ll stop there.

    ago, I had a meeting with a client who brought in examples &#40;for a wedding
    invitation that was part print, part interactive CD&#41; that were B&amp;W photography
    under bright red type. This example scared me &#40;not a very wedding-ish scheme,
    I had visions of U2&#39;s <i>War</i>&#41;, but it started an interesting conversation

  body: 'I have generally been okay. I use this both in my job which is in-house at
    a major Canadian public library&#41; and for my own projects outside of work which
    I am sad to say are very few and far bewtween. At the very first meeting &#40;or
    before in an initial conversation&#41; I outline my approach I ALWAYS express
    this request like this: <BR> <BR>In order for me to meet your expectations it&#39;s
    helpful to know what your expectations are, beyond the &#40;specification/requirements/whatever&#41;.
    Can you gather some examples for me and make notes about exactly why you like
    the design. I&#39;ll meet with you and review them with you on &#40;set a date
    at this point - don&#39;t leave it for later&#41;. This will help me understand
    your intent, and while I won&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;ll look EXACTLY like
    your examples I can assure you you&#39;ll look at least as good if not better
    in your own unique way. <BR> <BR>At that meeting when reviewing the examples make
    notes of words they say. They&#39;ll inevitably say stuff like &#34;and thisa
    one because it looks so modern&#34; which provide perefect opportunities to say
    &#34;Modern? Is it the font &#40;client speak&#41; that makes you think that?
    The photographs?&#34; And then write down the keyword MODERN. Over the course
    of 20minutes or a half hour you&#39;ll get a list of adjectives. These can be
    used to repeat back to the client and embedded in the specification and any reports.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll be speaking their language. They gave you the words. You will
    have witnessed the equivalencies they will have shown you what they think is Bold
    or classic or friendly. All of this can be reinterpreted and when you show them
    your work you can show them how your design meets these expectations as well as
    meeting the spec. This is also helpful when you go: &#34;We did thing A this way
    because we noted that all your competitors did thing A that way. We think this
    really stands out and looks keyword adjective&#41; as well.&#34; <BR> <BR>You
    can expand this to include things they don&#39;t like but I did that once and
    backed myself into a corner because the design required the thing they didn&#39;t
    like. So I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing the negative thing. <BR> <BR>an example:  <BR>NEW
