  management software to use, though the better part of its' usage has been on Mac.
  \r\n\r\nUntil recently I purchased the software to use it in my Windows environment
  and has been wonderful, until now. I have a family of fonts that I wish to use but
  when I resume to activate them I have this message: You are trying to activate a
  font which has the same criteria as a font that is already activated....\r\n\r\nI'm
  at a lost because I'm pretty sure the fonts are named differently, even don't look
  the same in preview. Has anyone else ran into this problem or have a solution? This
  has become a real pain to deal with not being able to use the type. I would greatly
  appreciate any solutions."

  body: "Whether fonts looks the same is irrelevant to the font activation mechanism
    of Windows. If the full font name is equal, the fonts are considered identical
    and Windows won't let you install both at the same time. Of course it can be done
    manually (add both to the font related part of Windows Registry and reboot will
    do the trick), but that is not recommended. Actually our font manager will classify
    it as an error that should be fixed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand font selection usually
    doesn't care about the full font name, but that's another story.\r\n\r\nThe solution
    is to uninstall the font(s) that have the same full font name. You can do this
    with any decent font manager. Of course you can also go to Windows fonts folder,
    and delete the font(s).\r\n\r\nAnother less common solution is to rename the font
    names (not the file names), if the license permits it."

  body: I have been trying FontExplorer for Windows and it's performing terribly.
    Laggy and it crashes every 5 minutes for no apparent reason. Today it started
    affecting Illustrator's performance-- sometimes Illustrator won't load at all.
    What would be causing this? It's making me not want to use FontExplorer any more,
    even though I loved it when I had an Apple.
