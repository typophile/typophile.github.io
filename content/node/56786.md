body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI would like to do an internship in or around Leipzig from October
  until January. I'm Dutch myself, but my girlfriend comes from Aachen, and I'm not
  at all familiar with that part of Germany. I'm looking for something in the realm
  of graphic design, preferably print-/bookdesign, though I'm open to other options
  as well. \r\n\r\nI'm trained as a graphic designer (BA + MA), and have two years
  of full time work experience. I'm very interested in typography (of course ;-),
  books (reading, collecting, making), music and travelling. My German is pretty good
  (writing so so).\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me out (or know someone who can)!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\ncheerio
