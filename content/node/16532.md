  creating a script font in Fontographer for PC and I've put quite some time in manually
  kerning almost every pair imaginable. After generating the font I opened the .ttf
  file to find all kerning is lost! The font looks like a mess and it seems like the
  kerning wasn't exported at all.\r\nCould anyone tell me what might have gone wrong
  and/ or how to generate a .ttf from Fontographer that includes my kerning?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n"

    \u2013 just the spacing . You'll have to do that yourself \u2013  \"Import Metrics\u2013kern\".
    \r\n\r\nCheck the font in a software like InDesign instead if you are unsure about
    the kerning being there or not."

      it's kerning sucked."

        font I've made in (not imported into) Fontographer doesn't seem to be exporting
        any kerning information when I publish it as a TrueType font, and the PostScript

  body: Certain Mac applications, too. In Word, auto kerning is off by default (both
    Mac and Windows), but you can enable it at a specified minimum point size.

    want to use my font in Word, but mostly in Photoshop and Illustrator. The problem
    is that the kerning I've done is lost even in the generated truetype file itself!\r\n
    \r\nHow come and what to do to prevent this?\r\n\r\nPlease tell me how to properly

  body: Joebob, unless I can poke around with the font, I'm afraid I can't offer a
    solution. Perhaps if you import the kerning as an OpenType kern feature and compile
    that - while keeping the traditional kern table - it would work. If you'd like
    to send me your font I can do this for you. chester at vllg dot com.

  body: "Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears that you have set things up so that
    kerning is required for nearly every letter pair; that you are using kerning to
    do the basic spacing for the font. In the second screen shot, you are showing
    the \"waterfall\" sample that Windows displays when you open a font. As far as
    I know, kerning is never shown in that sample window. \r\n\r\nSpacing should be
    worked out as far as possible by adjusting the sidebearings. Kerning is intended
    to be used only for exceptions (like \"AT\" or \"r.\") where the combination of
    certain characters creates spacing problems. That way, in cases when kerning is
    not supported, the font will still be mostly well spaced, with a few problem combinations
    here and there.\r\n\r\nMy apologies if I have jumped to the wrong conclusion about
    your case."

  body: "I have poked around with Joe's font, and indeed, there are 2621 kern pairs.
    This includes kerning between UC/UC, UC/lc, lc/lc, lc/UC, and #/#. The accented
    letters aren't kerned. There are a few \"ridiculous\" kerns, such as -1, -3, and
    1. Which makes me think that the font has been auto-kerned.\r\n\r\nI imported
    the kerning as a feature, and fixed naming conventions, then generated the font
    as a TT-flavoured OTF..\r\n\r\nThe kerning showed up perfectly in Font Book and
    Text Edit, but was NOT there in InDesign, which is something I have never seen
    in my life!\r\n\r\nSo, I agree with Mark that Joe should spend some time re-spacing
    the font, then get the kern table down to the minimum. Is it possible that the
    2621-strong kern table is simply too much for type-handling engines to handle?
    Might the complexity of the paths contribute to this failure?"

      it would result in an awesome real-looking script... I hadn't begun kerning
      the numbers yet so that explains why those look strange. Every other kerning
      pair was manually done (really!)\r\n\r\nThe remark about the windows display
      of a font being not-representative is interesting though....\r\n\r\nI'll start
      over with an auto-kern and some pairs that are problematic. Will show the results
      once I'm done.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your input."
