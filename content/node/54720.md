  body: Kjartan, what if you rotated the top M 90 degrees so the right leg hit the
    top of the D? Either way the D is too small in comparison and the type on the
    right should be left out until you finalize the mark. Right now it doesn't match
    stylistically.

  body: "Interesting idea... Miss Tiffany is correct, the top M looks like it hangs
    too much. You also might want to eliminate the letter shadows as they will create
    production problems, and they don't really add to the design. In fact, they will
    detract from the cleanliness of the design when used at small sizes (see image
    below). In general, shadows (as well as their negative space clearances) should
    be large enough to work at small sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MMD_6003_2_5613.png]"

  body: "I just don\u2019t think that the box of letters conveys the idea of a house.
    In particular this is because the perspective feels forced in a way that reminds
    me of technology/software logs. Also, the big heavy letters do not connect to
    the words, that typeface will never look good centered, and you need to track
    those caps out, not in. What is it about the houses these companies build that
    makes this typeface appropriate? And why doesn\u2019t that concept carry over
    into the mark?\r\n\r\nI think you need to go back to the drawing board and come
    up with a series of ideas that are much more literal and then move to abstraction
    from there. You also need to rethink your type choice."

  body: "If we're talking home building, the D looks structurally unsound: the M looks
    like an overhang, an unsupported awning over a void.\r\n\r\nI agree with chrisherron
    that the shadows will be trouble.\r\n\r\nWhat if you put a cube inside, maybe
    with a blueprint pattern?\r\n\r\nAnd what is the relationship between MMD (or
    MDM?) with T\xD8MRER/BYGG? Initials? A company name? It's good to spell out the
    company name so we know what it is.\r\n\r\nSquare and bold, it would be a useful
    logo for marking plans, tools, stuff around a job site. (But it *is* merely Helvetica.)\r\n\r\n--Jack\r\n\r\n\r\nJack

  body: "If you are going for a 3D mark made out of letters, I'd try making it a bit
    more geometrically interesting. At the very least consider folding M vertically
    in middle to form a roof or wrapping adjacent faces along D's curvature. \r\n\r\nE.g.
    rotate D 90 deg ccw and use it as a front side of the house, then use two Ms to
    form side walls and make them curve along the D and meet at the top."

    see how the \"D\" is actually an arrowhead leading from the cold, barren skeleton
    of a house to the warm, full-of-life house!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    MMD or MDM stand for? I'd like to know before adding my .02 cents. Thanks.

  body: "Well, I thought they were MMD... Perhaps it is too difficult to follow the
    MDM path for me.\r\n\r\nThree things I had to deal with when I was a beginner
    in studying Architecture:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Humans don't like to live within the
    stereotypes they use to represent their houses.</li>\r\n<li>In real life, one
    never sees the world from the point of view one use to represent it.</li>\r\n<li>Nobody
    feels him/herself represented as some lines whit a black dot as a head.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI
    forgot how many times me and my colleagues forgot those basic principles while
    designing houses in the wrong way, especially by not taking in account we build
    spaces for very complex individuals, not poultry farms for chickens.\r\n\r\nAs
    a teacher, I laughed with my pupils when, asked to draw some urban landscape,
    they used to show the upper side of things \u2013mostly balconies\u2013, something
    that was impossible to see since they were sat on the ground floor, but that was
    indelibly printed on their way of thinking.\r\n"
