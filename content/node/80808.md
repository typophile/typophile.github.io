body: "Hi, I wonder if there is some sort of one stop font information resource on
  the web where users can find information about a font and eventually leave comments
  about everything they know about a font.\r\nI often encounter fonts that I wish
  to know more about. The Typeface notes from the Adobe font library on their site
  is a good example of the type of info I'm looking for:\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1778\r\n\r\nFor
  example the last font I wanted to know about is a font I have on my computer but
  don't remember its origin.The font is LilyUPC. Making a Google search gives a lot
  of results and I don't feel like spending a lot of time checking everything hoping
  to find out some information. "

  body: "Every big reseller (MyFonts, FontShop, Linotype, Veer, etc.) often have some
    blurb about the fonts they sell. As for sale-agnostic sites, http://www.identifont.com/
    has some info, but you can\u2019t add yours, while http://typedia.com/ would be
    exactly what you\u2019re looking for, but it hasn\u2019t yet gained enough entries
    to be a reference.\r\n\r\nAnyway, from Ascender\u2019s site:\r\n<blockquote><p>Lily\u2122
    UPC is a Thai font designed by Unity Progress and offered under license from Microsoft.
    The Lily UPC Family (4 fonts) includes the Thai code page 874 and Latin 1 character
    sets. You should be familiar with the use of Thai fonts and multilingual fonts
    before purchasing Lily UPC.</p></blockquote>"

  body: A central source for typeface info is one of the goals <a href="http://typedia.com">Typedia</a>.
    So far, they are mostly the descriptions from the font publishers.
