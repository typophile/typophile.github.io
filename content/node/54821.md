  off from an entry for the type battle. I'm still very new to all this, so I'd really
  appreciate any advice or critiques that you can offer.\r\n\r\nSpecific points: do
  the uc and lc go well enough together? Would it be better without the stars - or
  with them kept as stylistic alternates perhaps? How about without the stripes? I'm
  not sure I like how the descenders look, going clear again below the stripes."

    i and j with them. Do more like the uppercase X... I love that. \r\n\r\nThe white
    and black stripes should be the same thickness, a bit thicker than they are right
    now. The descenders are fine below the stripes. What if the part of the descender
    below the stripes were solid black instead of solid white?\r\n\r\nI prefer the
    fatter C and G, although for the C you might settle on a single one that's halfway
    between the C and G's thickness. The bowls of the R, B and P seem off-center and
    too small. I hate both Js... don't know how to fix them, though. Not sure if I
    like the hole in the uppercase O. \r\n\r\nThat's my two cents. Take what you like
    and ignore the rest. :)"

  body: "Hi glyphobet, thanks for taking a look.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of having
    the descenders being black below the stripes - may give that a go and see how
    it looks. And yes, making the stripes more uniform sounds like the right way to
    go.\r\n\r\nWith you on the Js, but also unsure how to fix 'em."
