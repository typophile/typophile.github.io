body: I'm trying to find out years for usage of Gill Sans by the companies that have
  used it. So far I've been able to find many companies that have used this font including
  Penguin Books, Philips, More4, Film4, Network Rail, QVC etc. But I've only been
  able to find the years that it has been used for BBC, LNER & British Rail. Do you
  know where I can find further information of usage? I've tried looking into individual
  companies to see if they have details of their corporate identity but unfortunately
  I've had no luck. This is for a Graphic Design project which is due next week, I
  have the idea but I can't see it through unless I have the dates as they are integral
  to the design. Any ideas would be much appreciated. Thank You!
