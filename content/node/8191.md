  <BR> <BR>Reading and examining books in person is ideal, but I find the potential
  to actually flip through entire books online, scanned nicely- not html, very exciting.

  body: I am not sure how the quality of the scanned books will be, but hopefully
    good enough to evaluate if you want to make the effort to see the book in person.
    <BR> <BR>Upon further evaluation, print.google.com makes some sketchy implications...
    <BR> <BR>Q&#41; Does Google keep track of the pages I&#39;m viewing?  <BR> <BR>A&#41;
    In order to enforce content viewing limits, we must keep track of page views by
    our users. However, we do not associate any of your searches, or the specific
    pages you view, with personally identifiable information about you, such as your
    name or address. <BR> <BR>Yet another thing to make me flip-flop back and forth
    about how I feel regarding new technologies... <BR> <BR>r.k

    is too popular. Perhaps you&#39;d rather read something about knitting.

  body: Gee, THANKS, Rob...  ;-&#62; <BR>I came back from 3 days in Tahoe to find
    a 250-post wrench in my routine&#42;, and now this! <BR> <BR>&#42; Using the term
    loosely, I admit. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>They must be using OCR, right?  Pretty
    error-prone if you ask me. Which doesn&#39;t make the idea useless - in fact I
    find it pretty exciting, being more of a content &#40;non-visual&#41; guy. Or
    will they be doing the pitchurz too somehow? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: dang, I am glad I don&#39;t ever have to go to Tahoe for three days. Come
    to think of it, it is probably good I never leave my cubicle. <BR> <BR>... <BR>
    <BR>I have no idea how this is going to work, but it sounds amazing. Presumably
    they are scanning the entire page, images and all, with the text being searchable.

    <BR> <BR>I am wondering how you digitize 7 million books in 6 years &#34;non-destructively.&#34;
    That is rather impressive.

    of CD-ROM. High-res scans and a searchable backing-store of the text of cool old
    books. <BR> <BR>Si
