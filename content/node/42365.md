body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI tried the search function to find an old thread without success.
  We discussed a Font Management program that produces a new license order form when
  a user attempts to access a font in excess of the license. Can anyone track down
  the thread for me?\r\n\r\nMegacorporation is looking into purchasing a font management
  system so we can better track our font usage and ensure the proper licensing of
  our fonts. Are any of you using a Font Management system that works well? Any systems
  I should avoid?\r\n\r\nI talked to Halstead York about this way back during the
  Boston Typecon and he was kind enough to donate a copy the tech team could play
  with, so we will definitely be communicating with Extensis. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin"

    Haven't tried it yet.
