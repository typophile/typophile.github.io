body: "im trying to do a quick logo for a housing company that builds green. the company
  already has a good presence in the market, and are trademarking the term Smart Living
  Systems--however, this wording isn't protected (as everyone uses smart, and living,
  UNLESS there be some kind of logo involved. so the company needs a quick little
  guy to throw on brochures, online, things like that. (i say quick because only one
  line of their houses, which represents a small percentage of what they offer, would
  be using this.)\r\n\r\nThey want the acronym SLS in there, as well as the whole
  phrase. I'm trying to show a little bit of what they do as far as energy saving,
  renewable resources, and water savings. here are a few versions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-5_6265.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  first one's top right represents air--because the houses offer great air quality
  (but we do not do wind power so it may confuse the customer--i'll probably omit
  that feature).\r\n\r\nThe second two are the same with the exception of small details
  on the water spout itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what would help tidy it up
  a little?"

  body: The font chosen for SLS seems old fashioned and clunky for a green builder,
    but that may just be me. The black plug on the green S is a little jarring perhaps
    a gray or a brown? The black is over powering the rest of the palette. Tighten
    the space between the first S and the L. The details on the water spout are too
    subtle and will be lost at smaller sizes.

  body: "Kirsten, it's not just you. It does look old fashioned and chunky. It's communicating
    to me that this Smart Living experience is going to be some heavy burden.\r\n\r\nEvan,
    I think you need to think about benefits rather than features when you are approaching
    this expression of the brand. I would want my living system to be hassle free
    and making my experience at home better. With that, I would be looking at something
    elegant, friendly, and soft to communicate that. Possibly a lighter serif that
    still holds it's ground or a geometric sans.\r\n\r\nRight now, you're simply attaching
    objects to letterforms in a way that is trying to list off features and tell the
    customer what you do. Which can be ok, but I really think talking about how I'm
    going to feel by using your services is going to be a stronger approach. Plus,
    you need to integrate the elements in a much cleaner way than simply attaching
    objects to letterforms. Otherwise, you're going to lose you're viewer and completely
    confuse them.\r\n\r\n"

  body: '"The L for the nose" concept is pretty much taken by LG .. I mean .. it may
    not <em>look</em> like LG''s logo, but it has this one element that points straight
    at it. Perhaps it was suitable if the company was related to LG (like a distributor
    or an authorized "solution provider"), but for an unaffiliated company I don''t
    think this logo is a good fit.'

  body: "Second idea seems far better than the first, but I'll have to echo the comments
    about it being too busy (looks like 2 concepts in one at the moment). The 'eyes'
    kind of remind me of dollar signs from old cartoons whenever a character was tempted
    by money, not sure thats something you'll want to communicate.\r\n\r\nI do think
    it has potential. I would make the smile symmetrical (ie like a bracket on its
    side) and have it directly below the SLS. Then i would have the words below that,
    also centered. Perhaps horizontally flip the second S? Not sure. Again might not
    work but it's ideas, already used ones nonetheless."

  body: "The smile solution is better than the first you posted, though, as WhiteRoses
    said, it does really look like a -hungry for money- face and that is something
    you might want to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at it, I thought about a \"posh\"
    monogram you could obtain by changing the font (to some nice serif) and reflecting
    the second S  along a vertical axis, whose intersection with the other S creates
    a sort of heart.\r\nThis is not new, not original, but it might help you to explore
    other directions.\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is - what the target of this company?\r\nI
    don't know what is its position in the market and what kind of target it addresses
    its services to, but in my honest opinion (or at least in Italy:), people who
    think about buying ''green'' houses, are usually more cultivated and/or upperclass
    than the average house-buyers.\r\nWould they be attracted by a \"chunky\" font
    or a cheesy smile?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thankyou for the comments everyone. i ought to offer you more about what
    the SLS does and who it convers.\r\n\r\nThe company has their own logo and rather
    diverse, eclectic brand. They build homes that are classic, contemporary, sophisticated,
    modern, green, and even log homes--pretty much the whole range, from plush ranch
    style/conservative to the opposite of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nFor those buyers that
    are looking for something a little technological and up-to-date, comes the SLS--which
    is a box in the house that controls everything the house does in terms of the
    amounts of water running to certain features, the heating and air conditioning,
    lights, etc.  It gives the house the ability to communicate with us via the cell
    phone, so you can make changes to what you're house is doing while away, and it'll
    even tell you if a pipe springs a leak so you can get back home and fix it.\r\n\r\nthis
    option can be added to any line of the houses the company offers, but it is probably
    going to be implemented by those home buyers who are younger, more comfortable
    with technology (and cell-phones), and quite likely those who see a benefit to
    living lifestyles that are more sustainable.\r\n\r\nif we take that last group
    as our target audience, then I'ld like the logo to feel techie, yet a little playful,
    so as not to be completely off putting. i think the fact that the house is in
    communication with us at all times, gives the house an almost humane characteristic,
    and lends itself to an anthropomorphic type of logo.\r\n\r\nit seems playful to
    me already, and i will try variations in the mark as suggested. among any other
    considerations to be offered, and appreciated, perhaps some font suggestions as
    to what would feel up to date without feeling sterile. (my initial thought, stemming
    from a previous post, is gotham.)\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n"

    audience...as yes these people will have some money to spend but \"elegant\" is
    not their style.\r\n\r\n@whiteroses--i've tried for more symmetry.\r\n\r\nthese
    new versions are different from each other in terms of the angles on the bracket
    of the L and on those of the smile. i've also shown the type in bold or medium
    weights.\r\n\r\n@the other ppl--it seems to me that S's always have this problem,
    of being confused with dollar signs. What would help save the mark? A little contrast
    in the letterform?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sls4_3677.jpg]"

    enough, I really think that this is an opportunity to turn the 'high tech' into
    something friendly, particularly as this is really to do with the environment
    and lifestyle choices. The 's' almost look like glasses in this mock up, something
    you could play with as (not to be stereotypical) glasses kind of say 'smart'.\r\n\r\nJust
    a bit of inspiration, sorry to post ideas as I know it's slightly frowned upon.
