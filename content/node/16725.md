  I am just BAD at type.  I don't know if anyone could recommend a book that would
  help me get better?  I'm trying to get through The Elements of Typographic Styles,
  and I have a few other books.  But please let me know if there's another book that
  I should check out.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    what is around you. Take pictures of things that work. thats what it is all about;
    what works. Photograph a magazine layout that is striking, or a book that reads
    easily, or signage that clearly communicates. When the time comes for you to solve
    a type problem you will have a reference library. It is good to have work not
    to copy but to emulate. Observe what the artist did in terms of combination of
    type styles, proportion, spacing.\r\n\r\nIt is good to know what the masters think
    about type usage and combinations. It is also important, in my opinion, to see
    what others are doing; type in action. What does/doesn't work."

    \r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00072738I/qid=1125841233/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/002-9225507-9704050?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\r\n\r\nJost

    in typography' is essential, but out of print.\r\nIf you are lucky, you can find
    it online in antiquarian bookshops\r\nor in an university library. It's absolutely
    worth searching for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a structural approach
    and the connection between typography and graphic design as seen by a Swiss modernist
    designer see also:\r\nWilli Kunz: Typography: Macro- and Microaesthetics\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3721203488/qid=1134250494/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-9225507-9704050?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\r\n\r\nBringhurst
    is also useful and a good reference."

  body: "> I just bought Kunzs book on Amazon last night, so well see if itll do the
    job for me.\r\n\r\nKunz's book is basically an updated and more refined version
    of the same methods as used and described by Mueller-Brockmann in 'Grid Systems
    in Graphic Design', but it has additionally some very useful information on micro-typography.\r\n\r\nThe
    good thing about this book is that it shows how to set up a system which enables
    the designer to organise content in a more coherent and logical way. Every serious
    typographical work which has to convey complex information on several different
    levels requires a systematic approach which helps both the designer (to organise
    the content) AND the reader (to understand the content easier), and this applies
    for a book and for a signage system in the same way.\r\n\r\nKunz's own work (which
    is also shown in this book) is clearly based in modernist Swiss typography, and
    this is where the reader has to be a little bit careful. Whereas his work - which
    I consider to be brilliant - perfectly exemplifies that introducing order and
    logic into typographic design does not mean that creativity has to suffer, it
    is nevertheless in a specific style, and the reader of this book is well advised
    to copy methods rather than the resulting style.\r\n\r\nTsongtze, let me know
    whether you find the book useful.\r\n"
