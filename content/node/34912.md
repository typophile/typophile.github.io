body: "I'm working on a magazine mast identity and I'm having trouble finding a bold,
  condensed sans serif that is expressive, unique, fun, approachable, etc.\r\n\r\nAll
  of the ones I've looked at (see attached): Helvetica, Univers, Akzidenz, Franklin
  Gothic, Gotham don't seem to feel right. The publication name is long and I'm looking
  for an elegant solution.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Thanks,\r\n\r\nSam"

  body: "Thanks Fab, I looked at Knockout early on and felt it wasn't quite unique
    enough. Unfortunately my mast will not have an R\u2014Knockout's star letter.
    Tasse seemed a little serious/techy, but had a good dose of personality."

    a condensed version. You might want to check this as well. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/saa/series-a-d/

    go upper and lowercase rather than all caps."

  body: Great call Marco, I'm not sure why I overlooked Verlag Compressed (I actually
    like the Condensed more). Neutra Condensed is even more beautiful ... and not
    as strange as I would have guessed. Neutra really shows it's personality in body
    copy with those low x-heights. It really looks great as display.
