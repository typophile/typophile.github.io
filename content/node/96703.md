  body: The left looks like letter-spaced<a href="http://www.monotypefonts.com/opentype/gill/">
    Gill Sans</a>. The right does indeed look like Courier, but fvilanakis is correct.
    We need a larger specimen to ID.

  body: "The left page text is not Courier while the text on the right page it's too
    small for a positive ID.\r\nTry to upload a better sample: Zoom in just 2 or 3
    lines of text."

    quite seem to look like Avenir (at this resolution)."

  body: "The sans on the left looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/|Avenir]]
    to me. I have to agree with previous comments for the \"courier-like\" font you're
    after. A bigger sample would be welcome to positively identify this font. If,
    for instance, they're using the same typewriter as on the website, could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/courier-new/|Courier
    New]] and the sans [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu/about|Aper\xE7u]]
    (even if I really it could be it for the cover, really more like Avenir to me)."

  body: "Agree Chris (have also edited my previous post during you're posting yours).
    You could also check [[http://www.scottiecameron.com.au/|Scottie Cameron's website]],
    there's a sample of the book cover, used as overlay graphics, that looks clearer
    to me and made me thinking to Avenir. Another solution would be \"same fonts as
    website\" so \"Aper\xE7u/Courier New\" would be the winning pair."
