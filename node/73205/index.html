  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all,

I'm working on a refresh of a publication I've recently taken over, and the program needs some serious taste adjustments. The book is focused on some very specific music genres and I really feel a modern style sans fits the bill, to replace the current Gill Sans, but before I bite the bullet on finally purchasing one of my two "A-listers", I thought I'd see if I was missing a key player. 

Verlag from H&FJ and Relay from FB both seem like the head of the pack here. The term is a lift from Hoefler's descrip of Verlag, and I find it to be quite right. I definitely value the breadth of options they provide (three and four widths, respectively, each in five weights plus italics) and find that essential for the task at hand. 

Does anyone have any other ideas? I'd love to hear them and explore. 

Thanks much!

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, thanks for that. I didn't mean that the entire ad copy was "quite right," merely that the descriptive "Pre-War Modern" was. In any case, I'm not looking for the historical accuracy in use, so much as the style. Verlag and Relay both have this flare and glamour that I find particularly well suited for the task at hand, and they're both extremely well appointed, legible, and versatile.

Anyhoo...other thoughts?

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen,  

What a great read. I also have a fondness for Verlag (so it's nice to get a vote of confidence in that one), though I've never actually used it, hence my opening up the question and looking for other ways in (before I drop anywhere from $500 to a grand, I want to make sure I've covered my bases). My only reservation with Verlag, and for that matter, Relay, has been that I think they may now be a bit exposed now, particularly Verlag. Which in and of itself doesn't make them bad choices, but you know, Art Director and all, we like to feel we've made some unique breakthrough or whatever. True voice, ego-puffery, blah, blah, blah. 

I once worked for a publication with a slightly customized cut of Relay and I grew to *love* it. It's flexibility always astounded me, and well, I suppose that was the first time I came to understand the value of something like a superfamily. Funny, though, the retail version always hits my eye a little abruptly now. We had one of the more angular forms customized to round off and it always read better after that. The lack of said character now makes me pause before clicking the "add to cart" button. Neutraface is one of my all-time favorites, but having worked with it briefly on a project years ago, it has idiosyncrasies that I find distracting, particularly in text settings, much as I love it. And while I think the italic is beautiful, I don't find it particularly legible for the reader in the smallest settings.

So now I find myself ready to pull a trigger and wondering if there's still a lot of territory to cover that I missed. Though, apparently, there is not. James' 718 is very attractive, and I'm quite taken with it. I, too, look forward to seeing more of it.</div>

Frode, both Neutraface families are quite dramatic. I find them both striking and beautiful and I love the flexibility in their many drawings, but I do still find the exaggerated X-heights in Neutraface particularly difficult to read out of running copy, even with the adjusted text-face heights. It just doesn't hold in running copy next to Relay or Verlag...which is kind of too bad, because I like a lot of the personality in the face.

Brandon Grotesque is a lovely face; also find its price attractive, even if it's not the most flexible in terms of widths. Many choices...</div>
