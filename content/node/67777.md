  body: "It's Letter Gothic. Maybe you just compared it with Adobe's version of it.\r\nIt's
    more likely to be ParaType's \"New Letter Gothic\". You'll see the difference
    on the finial of the letter \"J\".\r\n\r\nBut, to answer your question. A free
    \"Gothic Letter\" look-alike called \"Letter Gothic Line\" is available here:\r\nhttp://www.dailyfreefonts.com/fonts/info/1325-Letter-Gothic-Line.html"
