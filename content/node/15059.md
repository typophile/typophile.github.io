  is Paul Dwyer and I caught wind of this group through another.\r\n\r\nI am a Canadian
  designer with a passion for type. I would call myself a \u201Ckeenly interested
  novice\u201D and am glad to have found this community. I will mainly lurk for a
  time, and surface only for questions or advice.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to it.\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nPaul
