  program at the tiny, young <a href=\"http://olin.edu/\">Olin College</a>, and I've
  been interested in studying typography for some time. I don't know if I'll ever
  end up working in the design world, but I'd like to explore my options while an
  undergraduate -- and since I have the opportunity to study away for a semester,
  I thought that that might be a good time to go study type intensively and see if
  it's a field I could eventually work in for a living.\r\n\r\nMy question, then,
  is whether there are any worthwhile undergraduate typography programs I should be
  looking at. Searching Typophile and the web turned up a lot of references to the
  University of Reading, though almost everything I've found there is about the MA
  Type Design program. Can anyone offer some insight into their undergraduate typography
  courses? Are there other universities with undergraduate typography programs that
  I should know about?"

  body: "Are you referring to typography or type design? They are not the same thing.
    If you want to study undergraduate typography any school with a good design program
    will do, and  at worst many design schools offer basic typography classes via
    continuing education programs for working professionals.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate
    type design courses are much harder to find. Karen Cheng teaches them regularly
    at the University of Washington, but in most undergrad programs they are offered
    sporadically or as individual guided study, if at all. I have heard about type
    design classes being taught in both the LA and Bay areas of California, but never
    nailed down the details, the local AIGA chapters might be able to help you with
    information there."

    been more clear: at this point typography is what I''m looking into. I didn''t
    know if there is anything in particular that the Typophile community recommends
    (I saw the list of schools in the wiki, but for the most part that seems to just
    be links to the schools'' own sites). I suppose that''s an overly broad question,
    though.'
