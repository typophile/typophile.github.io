body: "Hi everyone.  Please critique my latest work in progress, Brag, a black serif
  display font.  Lower case and a few upper case characters at the moment.  No kerning
  and very limited spacing (I'm concentrating on drawing the glyphs first).  What
  do you think?  I'm not sure about the top part of uppercase B, D and R (not pictured)
  how the thin comes out of the stem.  Thinking of going for a more normal look but
  maybe keeping that as an alternate form, but then maybe it might get too samey.
  \ I put the characters into what the font to see if there's anything really similar
  out there, as it feels quite familiar to me, but nothing really came up as being
  anything like it.  Anybody know of any similar fonts that I can look at for inspiration
  / problem solving.  I'm already dreading spacing this one.  I want it to track quite
  tight so I think there's going to have to be a lot of kerning.  Anyway, any thoughts
  and criticism much appreciated.\r\nCheers\r\nDave\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brag

  body: The element works, and the touch of Tuscan flavor it gives to the uppercase
    is fun and not out of place. I think there are a few glyphs in which it would
    help to pull the notch closer to the center of the stem, notably b and q.

  body: "To my eye the straight stems seem heavier than the thicks of the bowls. So
    letters like /l/ seem much heavier than letters like /e/, and letters like /b/
    seem unbalanced. To be optically the same, curved thicks have to be mathematically
    thicker.\r\n\r\nI like the concept and think it's working well. (I agree with
    cerulean about moving the notches.) I'll be interested to see how you treat /U/."

    they are, any lower and there's not much room for the ball terminals on j and
    y.\r\n\r\nNotches on b and p - I've noticed many fonts have a downward facing
    serif on b and upward on q.  Any reason for this other than that's just the way
    it's done?  I've brought it in a bit, how far should it come in?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bbqq_5214.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    have increased the width of curved thicks on lowercase.  Not quite sure how I'd
    managed to neglect to do this first off.  I thought I had but when I checked they
    were almost exactly the same width as straights.\r\nAlso fixed the leaning forward
    C, and added a few more uppercase.  I'm thinking if I go with the tuscan flavour,
    maybe the alternate N is better than the normal?\r\n\r\nRegarding U, I'm going
    to try both standard thick on the left, thin on the right, so spurs, and the Perpetua
    style more like lowercase u.  I'll post image soon\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brag2_5431.jpg]\r\nb

  body: "@hrant\r\nThanks for all the pointers.  I tried the same kind of serif shape
    as on the uc with the lc.  I didn't like it.  I think without the thin stemming
    from it, that shape looks weird.  I hope that it is echoed in the lc enough by
    a, b, u and q.  I might try it on m n p and r too.  \r\nI've pulled the leg of
    the k in slightly, but I think I like the shape too much to drop it below the
    baseline.  I'm thinking spacing/kerning problems - kl, kf, kb etc. I might just
    deal with by making nice ligatures, something along these lines:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kl_4363.JPG]\r\nYou're
    right about the Q.  I wasn't keen on it anyway and was looking at a way to get
    the tail more underneath it and less sticking out at the right (mainly to help
    spacing).  I've tried that number 2 style Q (don't know if it has a special name!)
    and I like it a lot more - just trying to decide whether to go with open or connected
    version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q_5565.JPG]\r\nI'll post more
    images soon.  I too was thinking the serifs on s,S and C (and maybe E and F) need
    something.  I'll probably put a bit of a curve in them as in z, maybe angle them
    slightly too.\r\nHere's the alphabet so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ABC_4937.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abclc_3482.JPG]"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brag3_5110.jpg]\r\n\r\nNew sample above
    with complete (for now) upper and lower case, and alternates of lower case letters
    with the upper case flavour spurs.  I'm quite happy with how it's progressing,
    at least in that I like the shapes of the individual letters.  Spacing is very
    hard, and I'm beginning to think it will need a lot of kerning and ligatures to
    look how I want it too, but...  I would like to get spacing as good as possible
    first (at the moment it's just very rushed spacing and no kerning) so if anyone
    knows of a similar font in terms of weight and serif size (ie not thin enough
    that serifs can overlap all that easily without looking bad) then I'd like to
    know so I can see how they deal with spacing.\r\n\r\nAny other points and criticism
    gladly accepted.  What do you think of uppercase options:  which Q is better?
    \ I like alternate N but trying to copy that style to the M doesn't look great
    and the W looks horrible.  I'm thinking the middle U but with shorter serifs on
    top.  I prefer the normal shape without spur in its own right, but with other
    letters the lack of weight is very distracting.\r\n\r\nSo that's it for now.  Numbers

    if you want it very tight, and that will backfire when setting strings of letters
    that simply cannot be too tight without colliding*. Look at it this way: you only
    need very tight spacing for display setting - for text** you can/should go looser;
    and if it's really for display you can/should expect the discerning type user
    to manually tighten & tweak the spacing based on the string at hand anyway.\r\n\r\n*
    And if you don't mind collisions then spacing is very easy.  :-)\r\n\r\n** I don't

    there are some glyphs where the white space gets crowded out too much, I think.
    For example top counter of /a/, between ball and stem of /r/, top counter of /5/.\r\nI
    think the idea of putting in that characteristic terminal in the lowercase is
    good. But I wonder if, everywhere it appears, that shape might benefit from moving
    the notch sideways closer to the middle of the stem (as was discussed a bit upthread).
    \r\nCounters on /W/ and especially /w/ look out of whack--relatively small above
    and large below--so those glyphs look \"like they're wearing their pants too high\"
    (as somebody once said about one of my letters). \r\n(By contrast, the /g/ could
    stand to pull its pants up a little.)"

    open Q too but was a little concerned it doesn't fit as well as the closed one
