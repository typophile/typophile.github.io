  too much, but I will be highly grateful for any assistance I receive while on these
  forums.\r\nNow, the reason for the post. I was hoping some of you could help me
  finding essays about Robert Slimbach's Minion typeface. It is not important which
  version: MM, Cyrillic, or whatever. Thank you."
