  much as I can. \r\n\r\nI don't know what other options there are except to be lucky
  and work somewhere that will allow me to experiment and learn a long the road. Any
  suggestions or experiences to share?\r\n\r\nThanks Typophilies. you rule :-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Have you ever heard about Purup Prepress AS, Denmark?\r\nThey were market
    leader for technical design of labels and packaging in the 1990ies.\r\n\r\nBefore
    I hooked up there as a region sales manager (I am a newspaper specialist, coming
    from Atex) I had no idea how difficult and experienced packaging printing is.
    Purup gave me a chance to learn a lot. Purup did a good job for education and
    documentation of their technology. I know e.g. there is a movie for free download
    on Lars K\xE4hler's Global Type:\r\nhttp://www.global-type.org/Film-Purup.543.0.html\r\n(157
    MB - 50 minutes) - so a lot of download-time. \r\nBut the film is great.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\nPS:
    And because life has a lot of humor, today the landlord of my Preu\xDFisches Bleisatz-Magazin
    is Bagel-Druck. The produced (and still produce) their designs for labels and
    packaging with Barco, Purup's hangman...\r\nhttp://www.bagel-druck.de/english/index.htm

  body: Target your job search on firms that do a lot of package design. Some firms
    specialize in it. Are you planning to come up to SF from Gilroy for work? More
    choices....

    design(issue 92,xmas 2006).\r\n\r\nIm sure some of the tutorials in that issue
    are in their online database of downloadable pdfs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials\r\n\r\ni
    tried to find it but they annoyingly lack a seacrh facility so you will have to
    trawl through them all.\r\n\r\nhope this helps :)"
