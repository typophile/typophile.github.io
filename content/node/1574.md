  body: Actually, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/onyx-mt/onyx-mt/testdrive.html?s=JUDY%2BCORMIER&amp;p=96">Onyx
    MT</a> may be closer, with its smaller serifs, though both Onyxes are extremely
    close to Bodoni Poster Condensed. The only real difference I can tell is that
    the counters are a little more open in the Onyxes.

  body: Yes. I bow to the Chesh. You are most definitely the man. Onyx MT is much
    closer than Onyx BT. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
