body: I have been putting together annual reports, magazines and multi-page docs for
  a long time. I have always been mindful of my audience, length of text, etc. and
  now have a client that simply insists that the text be at least 12 point. No matter
  what font. Typically, I have chosen serif fonts with large x-heights (for this particular
  project, Usherwood) to reduce the size to at least 11 pt and sometimes 10, just
  to get the enormous amount of text to fit in a reasonable number of pages. Long
  story just slightly shorter, what are your thoughts? And, are there recent articles
  about this topic readily available? I have a feeling that if I can present hard
  evidence to the fact that smaller than 12 pt is acceptable, I might be able to sway
  her. Audience is alumni and donors of a business college. Age is recent grads to
  30-year-out grads. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

    in various font sizes and show it to the client (make a test page). Chances are
    she'll appreciate just how big 12 pt is when she sees it in print. Tell her about
    how you can use more white space for readability, how lines will break better
    and how there'll be more space for good articles if the point size is reduced.
    Show her other publications and tell her the point size they're using."

    body: 'Thank you. I have actually already done most of that. I am in process of
      gathering publications similar to hers with effective use of 11 and 10 point
      type. Plus, I''m digging out all my old type books with entries about body text.
      Sometimes it''s just a little frustrating when professional experience and knowledge
      of said subject matter isn''t enough for people. '

  body: "I generally don't discuss point size with clients - just show them what I
    think works and revise it to suit their problems with it. My advice is to design
    it in a way that you think is proportionate and readable, regardless of actual
    point size, and if she's ok with it great. If she says the type is too small you
    might have to enlarge it. \r\n\r\nI have a client who won't tolerate justified
    type, another one who hates green. I feel your pain. But it can be a waste of
    time to try to 'educate' them. They just get prickly."

  body: "Me too, I feel your pain. I keep getting told that our publications will
    be read by the prospective students' parents more than by the young'ns themselves...
    \r\n\r\nMy co-worker wants increased type size, but won't yield on the page length,
    and we can't cut content.... So we have too little leading with a larger type
    size. Bah. \r\n\r\nK. \r\n\r\n"

    and them show him 13 pt type. Also explain him that point sizes have no direct
    relation with type sizes, bring two printed examples of same point size but different
    body size.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "Thanks to all for your kind input. This is the fourth year I've worked on
    this particular piece with this office and I'm sure we'll have a couple of go-arounds.
    Ultimately, she is the client and (agreeing with Pattyfab) educating her has not
    been entirely successful. The whole project usually just ends up with me hating
    the darn piece because of that rediculously large text - imagining how I might
    sway her next time.\r\n\r\nAnd, just because everyone has been so kind and helpful,
    I'll update you on the final decision for this year. Will it be 11 or 12 pt? Tune
    in next month to find out!"
