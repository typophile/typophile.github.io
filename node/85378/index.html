		<div class="commentbody">Claire, I’m not familiar with the rules outside Norway, but here you need to have (or be part of) a firm to make an invoice. You also need to state your address and business information (organization number & name), the customer’s address and list the items and/or services purchased and/or licensed and specify their price and any additional taxes and fees. You’ll probably also want to include some information on how one can pay you (account number, IBAN, BIC, bank name, &c). Each invoice must have a unique number (invoice #0001, invoice #0002 etc), and these must be generated by an automated system. The invoice must be in a read-only mode. I use a web service to make mine, and often provide a translated copy for international customers. 

I suggest you contact an accounting office to ask about what rules apply to your situation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Claire, an invoice is just a bill. A Google search will show you many sample invoices.

Things may be different in your country, but in the U.S. an invoice doesn't have to use a specific design. I've received invoices from individuals that were just emails, or were just handwritten on a plain sheet of paper. But if you want the invoice to look more professional you can use a pre-printed invoice form (available at office supply stores or on the internet) or design your own, and then either mail it to them or send as a PDF attachment. Here's the info on a typical invoice:

Date: today's date

From: your name and mailing address

Identification: In some countries you may need to list a government identification number for yourself, for tax purposes. A local business person or accountant (or maybe even a librarian) could tell you if this is necessary where you live.

To: name and address of the company or person you are billing

Description: Describe what the bill is for, and list the price. Be specific in your description so they clearly know what the bill is for. Also list taxes, if appropriate, and then a grand total.

Payment Instructions: I'm guessing the gallery will just mail you a check, so say "Make check payable to [your name or business name]." If they want to pay you by electronic funds transfer, you'll need to give them the appropriate bank info for that.

Reference Number: Each invoice should have a reference # of some kind. You could call it "Invoice #001". Or if you don't want to reveal that this is your very first invoice, number it #501 or pick some other number.

Terms: State when the bill is due (30 days is typical in the U.S.) and tell if there are any penalties for late payment.

Most invoices I receive say 30 days, and I believe it's still pretty common nationwide. But if you mean that most companies take longer than 30 days to actually pay, I agree.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Unless you stated it in your contract, the 'due on x' is fairly arbitrary...especially if your client is a big company. They'll pay when they're ready to pay, unfortunately.

You can declare interest after x days. How well you can enforce it is another issue.

For most of my clients (that I have a good relationship with) my invoice is typically just an email:

Subject: Invoice for (work description)

date: xx/xx/xx
description: (what the work was)
amount: $x @ x hours = TOTAL

And then add my address for payment.

		<div class="commentbody">This is the text of my invoice, which is more or less the text recommended by the Graphic Artists Guild. Of course, for most of this to be applicable and.or enforcible, you need a similarly worded contract to begin with. Oh, and in the process of copying this, I noticed a typo. So thanks, Claire, for giving me a reason to look over my invoice.

		<div class="commentbody">I started using contracts when someone took a brochure I designed for them, put it on a billboard, and didn't pay me for the additional use. My favorite part of the contract is this fantastic bit here:

————————
RIGHTS TRANSFERRED
The Designer transfers to the Client the following exclusive rights of usage:
Title or product:  
Category of use:  
Medium of use:  
Edition:  
Geographic area:  
Time period:  

Any usage rights not exclusively transferred are reserved to the Designer. Usage beyond that granted to the Client herein shall require a mutually agreed-upon additional fee subject to all terms. Any transfer of rights is conditional upon receipt of full payment.
————————

What this section does is makes it clear that you grant the client only the right to reproduce your work in a certain medium for a certain amount of time, and that you are NOT selling them the copyright to the design itself. Because graphic design is technically not copyrightable in the first place, you need to kind of invent your own copyright protection, which you do by including the above section in a contract. It also says that the client does not have the legal right to use your work until they've paid you, which is nice.

(By the way, my source for this wording is the Graphic Artists Guild, which publishes a "handbook" of sample contracts for all occasions.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Claire, something I want to mention is that in addition to any legal statements you want to make in the contract, it's also an opportunity to make sure that you and your client have similar expectations about the job, in order to prevent misunderstandings or disputes later.

It's a place where you can state 1) what services you intend to provide, 2) what your charges will be, and 3) what the project's schedule will be.  Even if you've already discussed these things verbally with your client, putting them in writing and having your client sign off on them is a good idea.

If you and your client are in agreement on those things BEFORE the work begins, it will greatly reduce the chance of problems later.
