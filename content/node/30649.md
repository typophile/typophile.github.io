  my friends, is the loverly logo designed for my Grandma's Tax company back in 1968.
  She would like to update it, but still retain a sense of the longevity of the company
  and the logo.\r\n\r\nHer new typeface for correspondence, etc., is Garamond Premier
  Pro.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    you think numbers live best in \u2013 serif or sans, and go from there. Also consider
    that this logo is, in my opinion, next to timeless; don't disregard that. And
    maybe that is what should dictate everything else, thus all faces should be modern/sans."

    thinking of Egyptienne F for body copy in her correspondence because of its obvious

  body: "Yes, the stem of the \"T\" should be centered with the aperature of the \"Q\"\r\nI
    agree with pearlstreet and grayson that the logo isn't really so bad. You should
    scan the thing, move some of the letterforms around a bit to get a solid alignment,
    make the boxes a little smaller on the x axis and ad color to the \"QTS\" characters.

  body: "Does your grandmother use QTS or Quality Tax Service?\r\n\r\nI think the
    boxes are interesting in a tax-form kind of way but there's nothing wrong with
    letting go of the old design.  It just appealed to me.  I thought the boxes helped
    align the letters.  Here's a version using Ketchupa which I recently licensed.
    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qts_5948.jpg] \r\n\r\nI rarely post
    here, mostly just read, but the old logo really appealed to me.  Thanks for posting
    it. It may not work anymore for your grandmother but I enjoyed seeing it.  \r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n

    with the Garamond as well for text.
