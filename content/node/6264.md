body: 'hi; i was wondering what you guys think of this logotype i created for a friend
  of mine who is starting up a network for artists &#40;who are active in social change&#41;.
  i thought <i>Impact</i> designed by Geoffrey Lee would be appropriate for its strong
  statement and connotations of you know, solidarity and activism. btw my name is
  andrea, i work as a designer &#40;with LOTS to learn still and i&#39;m mostly self-taught,
  with a background in writing&#41; but sometimes my favourite projects are the ones
  i do for my friends. i&#39;m new in these forums but i&#39;d like to say hi and
  that i&#39;m completely amazed by you people and all you know; it&#39;s nice to
  have mentors even if it&#39;s on the internet: &#41; btw i notice the male pronoun
  is often defaulted to in here, and i wondered if anyone else noticed that or has
  comments. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4680.gif"

  body: the logo is specifically for business cards right now; the budget is small
    so i&#39;m going to try to find a b&amp;w and red photocopier to reproduce them
    on; the back of the card reads &#34;Creating a space for artists engaged in social
    change&#34; &#40;&#43; contact info&#41;. thanks!! <BR> <BR>-a

  body: I think Impact has good weight, but it&#39;s too commonly used, so it makes
    it harder to be memorable. <BR> <BR>Maybe this is one place a unicase font &#40;like
    Emigre likes to make&#41; would be good? <BR> <BR>&#62; the male pronoun is often
    defaulted to in here <BR> <BR>Common practice, pretty much everywhere.  :-&#40;
    <BR>Although some languages don&#39;t have such an issue. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant speaks troof.    <BR>    <BR>But Impact for the &#34;ANA&#34; is just
    fine. I like it. I think you     <BR>could avoid appearing amateur if you use
    something     <BR>cleaner for the lowercase stuff at the top and one    <BR>color
    for the small type would make the whole mark    <BR>less busy. Let the big letters
    do the talking.

  body: I agree with the other comments here. <BR> <BR>Not to be a spaz, but I wonder
    if there&#39;s some &#34;networking&#34; visual stuff you could do with the horizontal
    and vertical strokes of the characters. You know, like make them weave together
    or something. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, I alkso agree about Impact. Most usages make me
    violently ill, but strangely, yours did not. Still, it&#39;s best to avoid typefaces
    that are on every computer in the world. <BR> <BR>One other idea I had was, I
    wonder if something more grungy would be in order? More protesty? Like the logo
    was created with a spraypaint stencil or something. <BR> <BR>Good luck...

  body: 'thanks for your comments. john: i also thought stencil would be good but
    my client had stencil associations that couldn&#39;t be overcome.. paul: hm wasn&#39;t
    there a thread in here about logos and  bandnames with backwards letters or did
    i read that somewhere else? as you can see i&#39;ve switched to antique olive,
    UC and tried to use the words to form a platform... &#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>ps. gender-specific pronouns aren&#39;t unavoidable in english, but oh well
    maybe you&#39;ll grow out of it;&#41; &amp; don&#39;t hate me b/c i&#39;m a nuisance'

  body: Olive is kinda appropriate, since its stroke contrast in reversed! Get it?  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>BTW, you might want to remove the trapping from those acute angles &#40;the
    ones in &#34;A&#34; and the two in &#34;N&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
