body: My agency is developing a visual identity for a swedish university college of
  film, radio, television and theatre. <BR> <BR>Right now different designers are
  exploring different solutions, my idea is basically to design a typeface with a
  set of special ligatures and icons, as the schools identity.  <BR> <BR>Initial inspiration
  has come from Meta Designs work for Glasgow and Matthew Carters for Walker Art Institute.
  <BR> <BR>But I thought, <i>maybe ze Typophiles can assist me as well</i>? <BR> <BR>So,
  what I&#39;m asking for is icon suggestions. <BR> <BR>The obvious ones should represent
  Radio, Film, TV and, er, Theatre.  <BR>I can see two ways to deal with this; either
  with the archetypic, generic symbols &#40;the theatre one with the happy and sad
  mask&#41; or a more original, yet <i>highly stylized</i> approach. I think both
  are fine, but they should all be on the same abstraction level. <BR> <BR>Next to
  those symbols, it&#39;s an open question; what else could I need? More to the point,
  what do <i>they</i> need? Obviously I&#39;ll ask them as well, but still. I think
  you&#39;re all capable to contribute. <BR> <BR>They&#39;re moving to a new building
  &#40;It has been built exclusively for them&#41;, so a Building-icon is on its way,
  signage signs such as arrows could be handy, maybe toilet signs as well. OK, the
  list could go on, but I would really appreciate some input. <BR> <BR>The stage is
  yours. <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR>

  body: I think you should consider having one &#34;umbrella&#34; symbol to tie everything
    together, and use a secondary symbol -or maybe acronyms- to differetiate everything.
    Consider making the umbrella symbol a set of three or four concentric arcs of
    a circle &#40;you know, like on a volume button&#41;, meaning something like &#34;to
    broadcast&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

- body: Hrant, <BR>Your suggestion has a different hierarchy than the one I had in
    mind and, I believe, is another idea altogether. <BR> <BR>If I had had the time
    I could have explored it further, but next week is a killer. <BR>Thanks anyway.

  body: The Fachhochschule Wiesbaden in Germany has a logo for each department, as
    well as an umbrella logo for the college. Their CI is Meta, I think. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    almost certain that Werner Schneider had a hand in their design. In any event,
    he taught their forever before retiring a few years ago. His Vialog from Linotype
    also has a symbol set, designed with f&uuml;nfwerken. But that doesn&#39;t have
    anything to do with the school &#40;although it is in the same style&#41;. Vialog,
    and some of its symbols were designed for the Munich Transportation Authority,
    which now has a kick-&#149;&#149;&#149; navigation/identity system as well. <BR>

    icons symbolized a bungee jumper? <BR> <BR>
