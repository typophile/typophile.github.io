  paper illustration in it. Any suggestions for typeface to go along with this? Maybe
  something fun, but not crazy

  body: "How about Postino or Bernhard Std.\r\n\r\nMontara by Jim Parkinson would
    be a fun choice, slight cutout feel with a bit of retro. \r\n\r\nJos Buivenga's
    Diavlo might be an interesting choice depending on the tone of your poster, and
    it's also free. \r\n\r\nAnother awesome font that happens to be free is Birra
    from Darden Studio. A little crazy, but too fun not to consider.\r\n\r\nBelwe
    looks like a good choice, fun without losing respectability.The flags on the the
    V, W, and Y make me think of festivals.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GarlicComp_5856.jpg]"
