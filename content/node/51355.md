  is similar to [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/giorgio.shtml|Giorgio]] by [[Christian
  Schwartz]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Readymade_4110.jpg]\r\nOf
  course, the x-height of Readymade is shorter than the one of Giorgio, and the characters
  are not the very same as characters of Giorgio. But Readymade seems to be inspired
  by Giorgio and Corvinus.\r\n\r\nThe designer is selling Readymade for commercial
  use, but it is downloadable freely only in this November for personal use.\r\n"

    uncanny to be overlooked though.

    number of differences besides just the x-height.  While he should probably mention
    his inspiration, this doesn't seem as much of a rip off as some of the other fonts
    recently posted on here.  To be honest I like his lowercase better :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    are many differences, though they are similar.\r\nIt might not necessarily a rip-off.
    I might have been out of line.\r\n\r\n<em>Schwartz credits Corinus here</em>\r\nThanks.
    I know it. That is why I put a link to Christian\u2019s site."

    you believe that to be true, why did you use the inflammatory word \"rip-off\"

  body: This style of lettering is my favourite to draw by hand, and I wasn't previously
    familiar with Giorgio, to say someone else created something similar is more inspiration
    than a rip off in my books. In my minds eye I always akin my drawings to a condensed
    Didot.

  body: "It is funny to see these type published nowadays. \r\nThe first type I ever
    designed (with FontStudio 1.0!!!) was a copy (read \"inspired\") of a typeface
    that the magazine Premiere was using for their titles around 1991-92.\r\nI rely
    liked that typeface, and i wanted to use it, but I had no idea how to get it,
    so I decided to make my own version of that font as an exercise to learn how to
    design a typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/criniera_5921.gif]\r\n\r\nFor
    everybody amusement you can see the results. Don't laugh too hard please.\r\n\r\nOnly
    many years later I learned that the original type was called Corvinus Versailles
    and it was designed by Dennis Ortiz Lopez.\r\n\r\nMy congratulations to both Christian
    and Flop Design for their more professional work.\r\n\r\n"

    \u201Crip-off\u201D in the title of this thread?</cite>\r\n\r\nI think it's just
    because Akira is japanese, Nick, and \u2013 like me \u2013 he often misuses an
    English word missing most of its possible impact on an English-native person.\r\nFor
    the little I have read, it seems to me Akira is so positively interested in the
    Latin alphabet that it should be praised, there are a little number of Japanese
    designer taking Latin seriously; for many of them, Latin is quite a fascinating
    \"fashion\" and nothing more\u2026\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like Giorgio so much,
    since, despite the big work on type families like that, there is not enough departure
    (for my conception) from the original model. I do not mean this ethically, of
    course, (there is plenty of it), I am just talking in terms of design.\r\n\r\n@Matteo:
    Ciao Matteo, come stai? :=)\r\nMatteo has been one of the first (and few) designers
    to use my Ottomat in our native Italy.\r\nOn a side note, his cover for the essay
    \"Impossibilities\" by John D. Barrow shows one of the most conscious and accomplished
    examples of Barry Deck's \"post-modern\" typeface Template Gothic in use."
