  body: "In order to pin this down, if you want to know which Caslon, it would help
    \ to see a few other letters. Some that would be especially helpful are K, J,
    C, Q, W and some lower case letters like a, b, g, t and y. The Serif Font ID Guide
    shows 34 Caslons, but the letters in your sample are not necessarily key letters
    for ID purposes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
