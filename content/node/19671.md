  me to select a typeface that would represent her and the body of work she produces.
  Her work consists of musicians, live performances, and musical groups in the reggae
  genera. She is a wonderful person to be around, very easy-going, and laid back.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks You,\r\nEmily\r\n\r\n"
