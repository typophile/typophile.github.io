body: I found this beautiful map of England hanging on the wall of a vintage clothing
  store in San Francisco. The style and graphics look familiar, and the publisher
  is VIDAL-LABLACHE in Paris. The main typeface used in the map to identify towns
  in England is a familiar looking sans serif, obviously designed in the pre-digital
  era. Any information about this typeface, which appears also in italics, would be
  appreciated.
