body: '&#62;Hello Typophile members and curious people, <BR> <BR>This is my first
  attempt on a serious Serif Typeface for print and i decided to design the complete
  characters on paper scketches first. Drawing by hand let me redesing any detail
  with more natural control, and i supose that is the better way of begin any font.
  <BR> <BR>The idea is to break the monotony of the curves with a straight internal
  edges, all trying to keep an organic feeling of many structure constants of the
  Azteca &amp; Maya geomerical art forms. <BR> <BR>Btw i want to publish the entire
  process since this firt sketch, so i need your suggestions on the estetic feeling
  that i want to keep, and the tecnical legibility changes that i have to add with
  your comments. <BR> <BR>Many of the characters are under construction so i will
  apreciate a lot if you can help me to decide why some characters works better on
  tecnical and estetic ways. <BR> <BR>Feel free to add any suggestion, critique or
  comment, <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>&#62;MH <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6758.jpg"

  body: Wow, this <i>is</i> nice! Those abrupt curves seem really promising. And your
    plan to show the development is great. And what a &#34;g&#34;! But in fact the
    one thing I would suggest at this point is making its ear go higher/stronger.
    Also, I think the color is slightly light for text. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s only
    audible for chocolate. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I really like it. I have only minor quibbles with it at this point, because
    it would help me more to see it set in text. But here are a couple of my comments:
    <BR> <BR>1. Though I appreciate the uniqueness of the lc x, the top-left and bottom-right
    ends aren&#39;t really picked up anywhere else in the set. I think making those
    two ends look like the ends of the z would make an elegant solution. <BR> <BR>2.
    Something about the lc p seems off to me. If you were to use the same approach
    to the bowl that the lc q uses, but keep the tail serif as it is now, they would
    be complementary but not mirrors. <BR> <BR>Those are really minor comments, though.
    The more I look at it, the more I like it. It makes me wish I were European, just
    so I&#39;d have a reason to use the euro mark. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t wait to see

    of the i and of the j, thing of which it does not bother to him so much to the
    f... is necessary to think that 98% of the designers do not know the ligatures,
    and they are only dedicated to use the programs&#60;&#60; <BR> <BR>That is a very
    good point Juan Pablo, but the f touch many other letters here; there is the b,

  body: Miguel -- <BR> <BR>A promising start. Very nice letters. The abrupt curves
    are reminiscent of the explorations of W.A. Dwiggins with his Experimental No.
    233 and his theory of the M-formula. Tiffany may chime in with more on this. <BR>
    <BR>I think this kind of treatment can be effective at very small sizes and at
    display sizes, but there&#39;s a middle range of text sizes where it can be tricky.
    You may find when your letters go from being outlines to being actual text that
    you need to move the corner further around the curve to prevent the x-height line
    from being spotty. <BR> <BR>I think the arch of your &#39;f&#39; may be difficult
    to fit. I also think the top of the arch should be thinned a little. And I feel
    that the top of your &#39;t&#39; should be a little more pronounced. <BR> <BR>--

    design, but also with the quality of drawing. Chapeau!! <BR> <BR>The only thing
    I want to remark at this stage, are that I am not sure if the roundings on the
    upper serif of the LC i, j and u will work that well. I think you&#39;ll have
    to reduce it, or find another solution. <BR> <BR>This design makes me think of

  body: Miguel, I don&#39;t have the time to present a complete summary of Dwiggins&#39;s
    theory. If Tiffany doesn&#39;t jump in at some point, after I meet my current
    deadlines, perhaps I can provide more information.  <BR> <BR>Just briefly, the
    &#39;M&#39; in M formula stands for Marionette. While carving marionettes, Dwiggins
    discovered that exaggerating smooth, rounded surfaces into sharp, angled planes
    allowed the figures to more powerfully communicate their character all the way
    to the back row. He theorized that the same kind of exaggeration and sharp modeling
    could be made to work in text types to give them additional &#34;action&#34; and
    &#34;vitality.&#34; <BR> <BR>This kind of exaggeration is well known in theater
    and underlies the practices of stage makeup. If you&#39;ve ever seen a stage actor
    in full makeup up close, you&#39;ll realize that it is always hideously overdone,
    but looks completely natural on stage under the lights. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: '&#62; natural kerning ligature <BR> <BR>It&#39;s certainly a good idea to
    make your &#34;f&#34; &amp; &#34;i&#34;/&#34;l&#34; glyphs in such a way that
    they join together nicely without anybody doing anything special, but of course
    because of possible tracking/justification adjustments you can&#39;t count on
    that entirely. <BR> <BR>BTW, when I was designing Patria I came to the realization
    that too often the &#34;fi&#34; and especially the &#34;fl&#34; are forced to
    join up unnaturally, when sometimes they shouldn&#39;t. Although I&#39;m actually
    ambivalent about the current state of Patria&#39;s &#34;fi&#34;, I&#39;m happy
    with my unorthodox solution with the &#34;fl&#34;, and I feel that the conventional
    approach &#40;like you have up there&#41; can ruin the texture of a setting. Consider
    ligatures with modified individual letterforms but no joining. <BR> <BR>Another
    serious issue with ligatures is that tracking can ruin things&#42; - just look
    at Gulliver&#39;s &#34;fi&#34;/&#34;fl&#34; in USA Today. <BR> <BR>&#42; Although
    I think OpenType allows the choice of ligature substitution based on tracking?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; hideously overdone <BR> <BR>Yes! And this is exactly why a good
    -I mean a really good- text face must look ugly in large sizes... strange but

    a monospaced font, but the viewing is done in a proportional one! This means that
    any attempt at getting a nice right rag would require an exhaustive iteration
    of correction/previewing. And sorry, I already spend enough time around here!

  body: The modulation treatment is great, Miguel. <BR>It embraces both calligraphic
    and geometric approaches, which is a thing many people have done, but you&#39;ve
    managed to keep  it very distinct and original. <BR>I don&#39;t know if the fi
    fl examples are your first attempt in drawing text type in bezier, but to preserve
    the strenght o your original drawings I would suggest to create loose grid background
    &#40;I mean even single circles or segments where it&#39;s appropriate&#41; as
    a basis to draw the letters. <BR>Many letters have an excellent and unique treatment.
    The g shines, the Q is great, and the s is very distinct, too. <BR>At this point
    &#40;after the pencil detailed &#34;sketches&#34; I would not look too much at
    existing faces for their form. You may look at them for points and handles positioning/relationship,
    anyway. <BR> <BR>I say all this because the fi fl samples seem to lack the strenght
    of the pencil version. <BR> <BR>I also share Ricardo Santo&#39;s observations
    on the width of the m, and I would give a more distinct feeling to the tail of
    the y. Don&#39;t ask me how. <BR> <BR>Your alphabet is very promising and could

    the shape of &#34;s&#34; doesn&#39;t fit with the other  <BR>characters. That&#39;s
    it for now. <BR> <BR>Btw, it&#39;s great to have the forums back. I hope I&#39;ll
    be able  <BR>to give my contribution by next weeks. ;-&#41;

  body: its going beautiful so far. there&#39;s spice and character all over the shapes.  <BR>in
    intuition i agree with what hrant &amp; omline suggested about the &#34;s&#34;,&#34;g&#34;
    and the diagonal forms. but i question my intuition- these things make the font
    alittle more original and rich. i guess each desicion has a downside. the core
    of the typeface is great, either way.

    you about the M-formula. What I&#39;ll do is quote a message that I wrote to the
    Typo-L list recently in response to a discussion about Whitman there. The whole
    thread can be found at <a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0308&amp;L=typo-l"

    -- thread #47 &#34;Whitman&#34;. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>
    <BR>There aren&#39;t many places to find out more about Dwiggins&#39;s M-formula.
    The only published treatment of the matter that I&#39;m aware of is Gerard Unger&#39;s
    article on WAD&#39;s Experimental No. 223 &#40;Hingham&#41;, which appeared in
    the Dutch magazine Quarendo, vol. ix no.4, 1981. Unger discusses the M-formula
    in the course of tracing Dwiggins&#39;s exploration of newspaper type design.
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany Wardle also touches on the M-formula in her dissertation from
    2000, including an appendix with a transcription of the entire letter where WAD
    spells out his ideas. <BR> <BR>One of these days perhaps I will find the time
    to treat the matter fully in an online essay on my website. <BR> <BR>For now I
    can summarize. The M-formula document was a letter written by WAD to C.H. Griffith
    at Mergenthaler Linotype on July 3, 1937. It consists of four short &#34;memoranda&#34;
    -- brief observations that all orbit around an idea for treating type letters
    in a new fashion. <BR> <BR>The first of these is a hunch that advertising printers
    are interested in a type letter that &#34;will carry a good charge of ink . .
    . and still look crisp and finished instead of blobby and squz-out.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>The second is a reference to an article by R. Hopper in Printing Art Quarterly,
    March 4, 1936, entitled &#34;What Will Be Tomorrow&#39;s Types&#34; which predicts
    a return to classical forms, but with less imitation of hand-lettering and with
    a new crispness and refinement influenced by precision machines. <BR> <BR>The
    third memorandum is the famous observation which gives the concept its handle
    &#34;M-formula&#34; -- M for marionette. This is Dwiggins&#39;s observation while
    cutting marionette faces that in order to really get the head of a young girl
    to &#34;read&#34; from the back seats, he needed to cut otherwise soft features
    as sharp planes -- &#34;These sharp-cut planes, when viewed on the stage, by some
    magic transformed themselves into delicately rounded curves and subtle modellings;
    and the faces looked like young girls from clear across the room, as well as from
    the front benches.&#34; <BR> <BR>The final memorandum refers to his stencil ornaments
    -- which he jokingly called &#34;geometric spinach&#34;  -- and observes how curves
    and lines go together to create a dynamic grace. I quoted from this passage in
    my earlier message.  [<i>from the previous message:</i> &#34;I note that straight-line
    forms and shapes of geometric curves properly put together achieve &#42;more&#42;
    effect of grace of line and curve and motion than do combinations of free flowing
    curves and shapes. The &#34;grace&#34; quality is somehow augmented -- stepped
    up to a higher level by the sharp angular quality of the elements. Also, a new
    kind of tingle and life is added to the brew.&#34;] <BR> <BR>Dwiggins pulls these
    all together, saying &#34;I have been cogitating the matters touched upon in Memoranda
    3 &amp; 4, with a view to discovering from them a method for modelling type-letters
    in some other than the traditional way -- to produce in the printed words the
    quite astonishing results I get with marionette heads and with geometrical spinach.&#34;
    He also includes some illustrations of his points and some trial letters for Griffith
    to consider. <BR> <BR>The practical essence of the M-formula was summarized by
    Dwiggins a year later as &#34;a method to trick the eye &#40;in viewing objects
    much reduced&#41; into seeing curves that aren&#39;t there.&#34; <BR> <BR>Although
    the image of Dwiggins having some grand epiphany while carving wooden marionettes
    has some romantic appeal, I think far too much is sometimes made of this &#34;M&#34;
    aspect of the M-formula. It&#39;s a catchy handle, no doubt, but the letter of
    July 1937 is really a culmination of ideas that Dwiggins had been formulating
    for at least a year before. In fact, about five months earlier, WAD had written
    another letter to CHG which laid out most of these exact same points -- referring
    to the Hopper article and talking about applying aspects of his ornaments &#40;&#34;junctions
    sharp and square&#34;&#41; to type letters -- without any mention of the whole
    marionette thing. <BR> <BR>Also, one quibble that I have with Unger&#39;s article
    is that it gives the impression &#40;unintentionally, no doubt&#41; that the M-formula
    was developed specifically in the context of newspaper type design, which, in
    my opinion, is not true. It is not until a year later that he applies the idea
    to a newspaper typeface in development. And even then, it is only one of five
    possible directions he presented. <BR> <BR>The M-formula document is filed in
    the Griffith archives with the dossier on the newspaper type Hingham. And Hingham
    is unquestionably one of the fuller explorations of these ideas. But, in my opinion,
    the original letter was conceived more closely in connection with the Falcon design
    where, as I&#39;ve said, Dwiggins also poured many of these ideas in search of
    a sharp-finished oldstyle, only to abandon it in the end. <BR> <BR>Again, sorry
    for the lengthy and slightly academic tome. I hope it has proved at least somewhat
    interesting to some on the list. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR><!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote>'

    your time explaining the M formula. <BR> <BR>Is very interesting to know that
    this is a great chance to contribute, in some way; the behaviour of this kind
    of ideas on a font for text reading on little sizes..is a big challenge to make
    one simple and functional font for newpaper readers. <BR> <BR>Now i ve got a more
    clear idea about the font, with the Upper cases almost solved, as you can see
    in this another pencil sketch. <BR> <BR>BTW, Quetzal is a beautiful name and bird,
    i think i will keep the name on this font :^&#41; <BR> <BR>Feel free to add any
