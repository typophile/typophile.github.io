    Ask them to make a new, proper PDF. \r\n\r\nYou can check if there are any fonts
    embedded in the PDF by opening it in Acrobat, and then going to File -> Properties
    -> Fonts. All the fonts used in the document should be listed there."

    the fonts are properly embedded into the PDF, you don't have to load them on your

    of work (images, fonts, color profiles, etc.) is embedded into the file.\r\n\r\nIf

    straight from the client and placed both pages in quark and indesign and printed
    the 2 pages from each program. The indesign pdf printed fine. The quark one couldn't
    even place the pdf because \"It was an unrecognized version of a pdf\" or something.
    Then I tryed bringing the pdf into preview on my mac and resaving it and bringing
    it into quark . it worked! BUT the fonts printed out all screwy. I have a postscript
    printer (hp laserjet 5100m) so there is no issue there. So it's quark and the
    client's fault. Who the heck uses publisher for print anymore? Well I have been
    told it's out of date and a no no."

    is at fault. If it's a viewing issue, then yes, they would need to update their
    PDF reader. But reading over your last comment I think Quark is at issue here
    - I'm not sure which version your using and I'm not sure what version of PDF it
    supports (which is not the same as which version of Acrobat-confusing I know).\r\n\r\nAlso
    you don't need to place a PDF into Quark or InDesign for printing - I'm going
    to assume you place them in Quark or InDesign to add other design elements - you

    what AGL suggests. I get the files second hand from my boss. To ask all clients
    to send some sort of pdf is a lot to ask. I will try opening the pdfs in the lastest
    version of quark and see how that goes in the future. But i think indesign is
    probably the best bet for now. Thanks!

    layout app is that - QuarkXPress?\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a PDF to have a hyperlink
    to completely external content (say, a web page), but that's truly external content,
    and validating such links would seem to be outside the scope of a page layout
    program. InDesign does not validate hyperlinks in a placed PDF at placement time,
    any more than it validates native hyperlinks in InDesign. (Leastways, that's my
    understanding - maybe this is a feature that got added in CS4, when I wasn't looking.)\r\n\r\nFonts
    are usually embedded. All other content which is part of the PDF is embedded in
    the PDF.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Is a pdf is a EPS? You say Mr. Phinney it is not. Well, thats true, it is
    not, but it behaves like one. All elements within the file, fonts, vector, bitmaps
    are embed in it or not, in the case of fonts. I did work with pdf work flows that
    run only on pdfs, due to files coming from Macs or PCs and, in a couple of situations
    when I had pdfs made by others and sent to me that not just had no embed fonts
    and incredidible it may sound, my rip, a level II Scitex PS/M was asking me for
    the links! Checking the pdf using Enfocus Pitstop I removed the OPI info, External
    Links, Annotaions, Invisible Data, Meta info, etc. on the file and tried again:
    same result.\r\nTo finish that job I opened the file in Photoshop, reworked the
    images, converted the text to 1-bit tiff and assembled the file again using Quark
    and finally I got the file to rip.\r\n\r\nYou mention Quark. Yes, there is trouble
    sometimes placing pdfs in Quark (6.5 and up). I would say that if one has trouble
    with pdfs, the best way out is using Adobe software to fix or import to. Quark
    is very good at producing files and they work anywhere, and like everything else,
    and that includes Adobe, there are trouble sometimes (mostly by operator error).\r\n\r\nIndesign
    (Illustrator-PageMaker) is the best thing out there to place or produce pdfs,
    you know that, and I agree. No matter what, if one has a .ps file produced from
    any app (could be Freehand 2.0) and distill it, then you have got yourself a file
    that works anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy comment on a pdf being a EPS is general, because
    in the end, it behaves just like one when imported or placed.\r\n\r\nA tip: If
    you export a pdf from Indesign and try to open it with Preview the pdf fails to
    open. The same file after being \u201Csaved as\u201D with Acrobat will be opened
    by any pdf reader from Adobe or others.\r\n\r\nAnother tip: If you have a eps
    made in Mac OS X or Classic mode you can produce a pdf as good as it could have
    been using Acrobat, only that sometimes doesn't embed fonts if the font doesn't
    allow embedding. In that case, convert font to curves and that is the end of the
    problem.\r\n\r\nThat's what I do, but in my case, I am dealing with single page
    artwork. If you are dealing with multi-page docs, then, you need the real thing:
    Acrobat & Distiller.\r\n\r\nSo, my understanding is, a pdf behaves like a eps;
    PDF os EPS, one has to know what is gonna happen with that file when you send
    it to the print shop. Basically.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    that as commonly used, EPS and PDF often behave similarly. But EPS is a much more
    free-form and less structured format. It can handle anything the PostScript language
    can do. From a technical perspective, an EPS file can be software, not just a
    document; it is not necessarily static. A PDF is completely deterministic.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    very good rip. I could rip the file with a option to let go and rip with error,
    it would message missing links. Then, looking at the CT file it was a low jagged

    Indesign makes the best pdfs. Just that Preview on Mac OS X 10.4 seem not to like
    them, on the occasions I tried opening them after they were created. The same
    pdf would open in Acrobat and, after \u201Dsaved as\u201D the file could be opened
    in Preview.\r\n\r\nNow, Preview isn't a app when preflighting pdfs, for that you
    can use the real thing: Acrobat. I use Preview cause I don't have the real app.
    It works for me, as I convert eps's out of old FH55 and Qrk 3.32 (...)."
