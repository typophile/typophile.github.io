    effect\" here is exactly the sort of thing in type that you can't know until you
    try it out. Sometimes you can tell with enough certainty before you even try something
    out, but my lack of \"culturally progressive\" experience in Cyrillic precludes
    that here; until now I'd only made \"safe\" Cyrillic glyphs.\r\n\r\nSo, you'll
    never know if you don't push. The trick I guess is to glean what kind of design
    (for what kind of customer) is a good opportunity to push, and when it's better
    to humbly follow precedent. In that this is clearly not a face for long text anyway,
    my chances seem decent; on the other hand it's a commissioned design, not a speculative
    retail one, so there's more risk than I might like.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    are different between the lc and UC, which I'm doing myself*. The fact that Grace
    has left the UC Zhe symmetrical also makes sense, since the UC set is monumental
    while the lc is more organic (and secondarily that the UC doesn't need to be as
    readable). You can see this in the Ya as well (and probably elsewhere - I'll be
    perusing the PDF for sure). And there's some other funkiness as well, like all
    the serif action - wow, brave student, that one.\r\n\r\n* Mostly by having more
    rounded corners in the lc, and almost none in the UC.\r\n\r\nOne place I've been
    a little bit more pushy (quite likely too pushy) is that the Ka and the Zhe are

    seems pretty good. a couple things that are concerning. Your shape for \u0423
    makes it hard to be read, i think it would be too easy to confuse with \u040F.
    i don't understand why the leg on the \u0434 continues from the main stroke when
    this is not the case with \u0414, \u0446 or \u0449. i'm wondering what your reasoning
    was behind this decision. i'd like to see the \u0414/\u0434, \u041B/\u043B all
    share the same structure, in particular i like the shaping of \u0414/\u0434 better,
    but that's just me. i'm sure you chose disparate forms for readability sake, but
    i think it would make the face more cohesive if they matched. The bar on the \u0424
    can actually extend below the baseline and above the cap height a bit: I think
    it would look better with a bit bigger body. I'm wondering why you made the \u0413/\u0433
    so narrow. Also, i would think the flag on the \u042A/\u044A could be more pronounced
    as this is a distinguishing feature and would aid deciphering this letter in text.
    lastly, i wonder why the crossbar on the \u042E/\u044E is so high, it looks funny

  body: "Strikes me that it makes more sense to have the italic rotationally symmetrical
    but the roman more reflectionally symmetrical (about the central stem/y-axis).
    Not sure why but feels more appropriate, maybe I'm thinking of those zhe's which
    have a lower case 'c' structure to them (a bit like a cursive Greek kappa with
    a vertical line down the middle. They only seem to exist in italic.\r\n\r\nPlus
    don't you love the way both the words Italic and Roman effectively mean 'from
    Italy' (and thus Latin) and therefore are perhaps rather inappropriate in a conversation
    about Cyrillic? Maybe one should talk about cursive and upright instead? Can of
    worms maybe, sorry.\r\n\r\n(If it's not already apparent, I'm out of my depth.)\r\n\r\n"
