  body: "The \"g\" might be mistaken for a \"q\" at first glance, the \"f\" without
    a crossbar is interesting but may prove too distracting (notice the big gap that's
    apparent). The general feel is good although it seems like too many of the letters
    \"rest\" on a flat \"bottom\" which adds a noticeable mechanical/rule-bound force
    that detracts from the general dynamics of the whole. Or basically work a bit
    more  on the bottoms of your letter-shapes in keeping with the general feeling
    of the design - right now a few of the shapes are too \"flat\" down there.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

  body: "the \"f\" without crossbar is because i dont know how to do it and the flat
    shapes is because with a rounded shape makes it seem like too tiptoe in the base.\r\n\r\nalso
    is very similar with this another font http://www.flickr.com/photos/de_gregorio/2136657922/in/set-72157603741398142/"

  body: "I love the general feel of your letters; I think perhaps the bottom line
    of letters such as m, r, h, i, l, k, which are at the moment quite sharp and square,
    could do with a little more bounce (so to speak).\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about the
    upper case 'U', it seems a little lifeless and square, compared to your beautiful
    upper case 'C' and 'K'.\r\n\r\npersonally, I think the lower k is also beautiful.
    :)"
