  ad]], checked it out, then didn't think about it much more. Later on it hit me \u2013
  the font is the same as the font from the US hardcover edition of Peter Carey's
  \"My Life as a Fake\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mfake_6515.jpg]\r\n\r\nor,
  with traced detail:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fa_5537.jpg]\r\n\r\nAfter
  searching all around, looking at various sets of slab serif fonts and more, I've
  gotta say I'm stumped. Is there anyone out there who can identify this oblique puzzler?"
