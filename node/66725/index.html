On iPad Eve I feel, as book designer, editor and typographer, much the same excitement that came with the introduction of quality paperbacks in the 1950s. Our book culture cannot without mediation just be republished in new media. All our typographical skills are needed to make the tablets function in a humane and literate way and thereby assist the survival of the book.</div>

I found the page turning effect interesting. It's not something that's been done on an eReader yet (that I know of) perhaps for a number of reasons including processor power and, well, it usually tends to be cheesy. But it may make sense on the iPad. 

I didn't see all the detailed spec's on the screen yet. Anyone know if it's just standard backlit LED?</div>

BTW, the screen is only 1024×768. For that high price, a rip-off. Also, it's not usable under light; they should have added an OLPC-style monochrome overlay, not least to compete against eBook readers.

You don't <em>have</em> to only target the limited conscious tastes and sensibilities of users. A company can choose to make things better, deep down, long-term, in fact even if it only believes in the bottom-line.

AFAIK the EPUB ebook format which the iPad uses can contain embedded fonts. So it's more the question if the publishers still know that appropriate choice of typeface can add to the reading experience.

Don't be so sure about those millions of readers who are looking for versions that "look like the paper versions".
Digital books aren't about the paper version onscreen. We've got PDF's for that already.
Just MHO.

Good H&J will win out over bad in the end. But in the meantime, there will be a lot of ragged right - you'll see.

What a long strange trip it will be...

		<div class="commentbody">EPUB can contain embedded fonts, basically using the @font-face rule in the CSS and packing them up in the assets. But most e-reader software that I’ve looked at ignores any embedded fonts. 

I haven’t done exhaustive research, but Adobe’s Digital Editions is the only one I’ve encountered that supports @font-face and utilizes the embedded fonts. But I don’t think it’s available on any mobile or e-reader platforms.

Setting aside the licensing etc. issues of @font-face, my question is whether the Apple iPad e-book software will support @font-face embedded fonts, or is only selectable among system-installed fonts. I suspect the latter, unfortunately. And it will probably be a closed system typographically, like the iPhone and iPod.

If by some chance it does support @font-face, then the next question will be whether it supports WOFF. Again, I suspect it doesn’t.

With books, I do get a bit concerned; Apple does not have a perfect record in the field of typography. And if Apple gets big enough, it does not have to think about that. Like Microsoft in too many fields; lowest common denomerator is quite enough.

I do wonder if things like the kindle app will be allowed to co-exist on the iPad. There's the hardware, but if they still allow other eReader apps, that could be a very good thing.

Lexcycle’s Stanza app on the iPhone/iPod Touch has a page turn transition. And the speed of the transition is tunable to achieve something that feels natural with your reading speed. I don’t find it cheesy at all, and much more familiar than the other options like slide or none.</div>

I don't find the page turn cheesy either. And it's a fun little virtual reality thing.

What I'm waiting for is the digital equivalent of the flip-through. Which I'm imagining as a continuous right-to-left scroll. (At least on a per-chapter basis. I hate having to go back to the TOC or Index to go searching. And what if I just want to get the gist of the book?)
Anybody seen anything like that?

You know, if I didn't have to pay $15/month* to get 3G access
on it, I might. The way I see it, I already pay money for Internet
access with my cable provider - I don't want to pay some monthly
tithe to one of those skanky cellphone companies. Right now I can
use my HP 2140 just fine with WiFi. And it multi-tasks...

Thanks for the Stanza tip. I had a feeling I was missing something.

@all
Ran across one wag's thumbnail analysis of the iPad that rings true to me as far as the iPad as an e-book reader:

&#8220;As for the Kindle comparisons... 
The Kindle is $259. The Kindle DX (similar screen size to the iPad) is $489. Both include free 3g connectivity and have battery life of a week. 
The same functionality on the iPad would cost $629 (for the 16Gb with 3G) and then $180 a year for the low plan of 3G wireless access. And your battery would only last 10 hours, so you'd need to plug it in all the time. Plus, the books seem to be about 50% more expensive than on the Kindle. So, as a straight ebook reader, it loses. 
Its advantage comes in being more than that. Unfortunately, it's not all it could be. It's basically an iPod Touch with a big screen. No camera (for Skype), no Adobe Flash, no USB ports, no SD expandability, no multitasking, no real PC apps (OpenOffice.org, Firefox, etc).&#8221;

Right, but it's not meant to be a full PC. So I don't think those are detriments. Between the eBook thing and the iWorks/keyboard, it definitely feels like it's going to be heavily targeted at the .edu market. 

For most PC users, I think it will be very much like the iPod itself...an accessory. 

I'm not sure how it'll work as a eReader, though, given that it's a back-lit screen. Not the most ideal for reading long texts. </div>

It's at the very low end. Is Apple supposed to be low-end?
Many HTC phones are 250 dpi. Same with the Sony P mini-netbook.
When it comes to browsing and reading (anything besides looking
at purdy pitcherz) that makes all the difference.

I think it's sort of cute that now people can get a box that is both your iPhone and your Kindle... although I consider computers a more useful application for that kind of electronics.

But, yes, the word spacing is quite wide in the photo, and I can see why Apple doesn't trust itself to hyphenate other people's proprietary and copyrighted texts perfectly every time: they're afraid, I suspect, that if their hyphenation software makes a mistake, they'll offend a publisher. (And letting people turn the hyphenation off would presumably make too confusing and complicated an interface.)</div>

That's my gut reaction most of the time, too.

That said, I think that's probably what has been lacking in the ebook market. People likely do want some of the 'bookiness' in their digital device.

I have a hunch that the 'bookshelf' and 'page turning' may just be options, as well. Given that it's iTunes based, I'm sure there are more modern 'views' to navigate one's way through their library. 

I also think the periodical industry is likely pining for a 'paper' version of digital delivery.

I've not liked the concept in the past, but I'm warming up to it as the devices get larger and higher resolutions. I think the NYtimes is heading in the right direction with the technologies they're building. A cross between websites and a paper. 

If I could subscribe to magazines on an e-reader, and be able to retain the tactility of pages, but with the added benefit of the technology allowing for certain levels of interactivity, I think that might hit a sweet spot. </div>

Hrant, don't forget to factor in screen size when talking comparatively about resolution. Higher resolution screens have increased incidence of manufacturing faults (dead pixels), and hence attrition in terms of the number of screens rejected in quality assurance. This attrition rate is acceptable in the manufacture of screens for small devices such as phones, but as screen size increases not only are the per unit manufacturing costs higher but the number of potentially dead pixels also increases. The attrition rate becomes unacceptable. For its size, the iPad 132dpi screen resolution cab be considered relatively high.</div>

But not for its price, nor its prestige-value.

If you look at netbooks, even modest brands are starting to
get "HD" displays: 1366 by 768. They're 10" in size, which
translates to ~160 dpi. My HP 2140 (which I bought about
7 months ago now) has such a screen, and it was $450.

I'm not saying there's a chasm between 132 and 160, but
Apple thinks they can get away with saving a few bucks
on the display, because the iTard population is on a steep
rise. Sadly, they're probably right. And come this Xmas
they'll cut the price drastically*, and all the envious iTard
wannabes will jump from one iFad bandwagon to another.

* But it will still have lousy text.

Well, some people actually do appreciate Macs as very good work tools.
But you're probably right in that the hordes who buy them for their sexiness* 
are outnumbering us now, and it does seem that Jobs&Co. let them dictate 
the agenda. Which, like I said above, does to a degree mean betraying what
Apple originally stood for.

The success of Apple, IMHO, is because he's not a typical salesman. Rather, he's a demanding project manager who insists on focusing on the details of the product.

A real salesman doesn't care what he's selling. Jobs does care. 

Granted, he doesn't care what we think of it. He only cares what he thinks of it. It's worked fairly well for the company thus far.

Well, I've known several Sales people that will tell you that. Their passion and skill is in the selling, not the selling of a particular product.

As for Jobs caring, well, it's well known that he is not an easy guy to work for given his demands on the products they produce. 

"That's exactly part of the problem."

How so? I'd say the success of the store shows that they are very user-focused products. Lots of people walk in there, touch the stuff, then end up walking out with less money in their wallet. </div>

I'm really not necessarily talking about the iPad here but:

1) Computers can be very pretty and still be very good tools.

2) Aesthetics can provide added value beyond a «this is sexay and mah friends will luv it» reaction, and in Macs I think that is the case. While I agree that Apple is now focusing too much on making sexy stuff for the masses, there are a whole bunch of Mac users who are not stupid lifestyle junkies, but do get more satisfaction and more productivity from working in an environment and with a tool that isn't ugly – that provides some basic aesthetic satisfaction, and makes it feel like some thought went into designing it.* A bit like people are more comfortable (and – I would claim – more productive) working in an office that isn't all grey wall paint, cheap plastic, and smelly old carpets, and wiring that runs in ugly ways because it was easier to produce that way. 
And parenting? Dunno, but when I work, I don't want to be taught what's good for me, I just want my work environment and tools to not slow me down, and not annoy me, and facilitate a smooth process.
(* Which obviously means other things than just aesthetics too.)</div>

Sounds like you have a bad Apple store in your neck of the world.

In the US here, the Apple store is one of the few places where I (mostly) trust the salesfolks to know what they are talking about. Granted, this is the land of Best Buy, so we really have no where to go other than up in terms of improving the retail experience. 

I agree with your sentiment on 'helping users'. I think Apple does that fairly well, at least compared to your standard off-the-shelf Windows box, which typically involves a bit of knowledge to clean out the system and install the proper security patches and software. 

A lot of iPad griping is purely griping about the spec's on paper. Which is fine, but not really of much concern to Apple. Their thing is having people touch their products and that, alone, seems to be a strong enough method of moving product to keep them in a healthy financial position. For every Apple product, there is a competitor's product that is a) cheaper and b) has a more robust spec sheet. Yet they just don't have quite teh same tactile appeal.

Physical interaction. So both the hardware and software.

You call that lust. I call that user experience. 

"I think it's in the mind. People are sheep."

The 'sheep following fashion' factor of Apple's success is way overstated.</div>
