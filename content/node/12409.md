body: "A printing method where type, in the form of metal or wood letters, or more
  widely since the end of the 1990s, [[photopolymer]] plates, and optionally graphics
  are placed on a press  or another stable platform to accept weight and pressure,
  locked tight in place, with a [[quoin]] (specialized wedges), inked, typically with
  a rubber roller, covered with paper, or other impressionable and portable material,
  subjected to pressure and release within a press, after which the ink remains on
  the paper, and the process may be repeated.\r\n\r\nThere's a pretty good entry on
