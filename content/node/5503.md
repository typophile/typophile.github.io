  body: This has come up before &#40;or maybe somebody asked me about this via email&#41;,
    but I can&#39;t find the thread. <BR> <BR>The large capital G, PG, and R date
    back to when the ratings were introduced in 1969 and were custom designed. <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/bold/testdrive.html?s=RPG&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Melior</a> is similar as is the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/renault/bold/testdrive.html?s=RPG&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Renault</a> font, but there are no off-the-shelf fonts that will
    match these. The 13 is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-korinna/bold/testdrive.html?s=13&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Korinna Bold</a> and the NC-17 is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-stone-informal/stone-inf-itc-bold/testdrive.html?s=NC-17&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Stone Informal</a>.

  body: Does anyone think the NC-17 one is a recent addition?  <BR>The characters
    look pretty different from the other ratings.

  body: 'I believe these characters are different &#40;see Mark&#39;s post above&#41;.
    NC-17 was added much later than the original ratings &#40;in the 90s, I think&#41;
    and intended or not, became the defacto replacement for the dreadful-sounding
    but seldom-used &#39;X&#39; rating. Also PG-13 was created in the mid 1980s after
    Spielberg campaigned the MPAA and argued there was too much of a gap in between
    PG and R. <i>&#40;Many, including Spielberg, thought Indiana Jones and the Temple
    of Doom was too dark for the PG rating it received&#41;</i>. As mentioned in one
    of those earlier threads, I don&#39;t think they redrew the seemingly-custom ratings
    logos, but simply patched them. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>James is fine, Yves, but I don&#39;t really care
    either way. Hope you&#39;re enjoying that new arrival! Time flies, before you
    know it they&#39;ll be off to college. '
