		<div class="commentbody">Bold italic is overrated.
But, yes, if it&rsquo;s not a purely display typeface, at least one different style (it could simply be a semibold, for example, not necessarily an italic), for emphasis and such, will greatly improve the usefulness of the design.
But maybe you don&rsquo;t mind seeing your typefaces in the wild faux-bolded and faux-italicized&hellip; ;-)</div>

<p>Seriously though, for credibility, you&rsquo;ve got to do one of the following:
(a) surrender and do at least 4 fonts, maybe 64+, or
(b) execute one of the finest pieces of design ever; see for example Transport Medium and Heavy (&ldquo;no italics please, we&rsquo;re British, and we like to be able to read our road signs from 10 miles&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;re talking &ldquo;Display fonts get you off the hook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact that more and more type designers are venturing into super-family territory is not going to help your cause if you are designing something that&rsquo;s not for display purposes (whatever that even means).</p>
<p>Who is to blame for this obsession with complete saturation of a type family? Are you simply vocalising an irritation that we all have with having unrealistic and unnecessary expectations on us all because there are a select handful of &lsquo;freaks&rsquo; who have no problems designing MM fonts with 17 axes!</p>
<p>Or are the rest of us just lazy or economically unproductive.</p>
<p>Great thread, Dan. This would make a superb thesis (&ldquo;Are we all striving for the unattainable?&rdquo; or &ldquo;The (fair and unfair) obligations of a credible type designer&rdquo;) Would love to hear what, for example, Jonathan Hoefler&rsquo;s view is. Probably something like, &ldquo;Put the customer first and don&rsquo;t forget to give the customer exactly what he wants, making sure you never let the customer down, and, if in doubt, put yourself in the position of the customer and then exceed the customer&rsquo;s expectation at every level.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s the case, that approach has certainly led to some of the most amazingly broad and robust type families in recent times.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan,
In the past 5 years, I have started and am still working on 17 different type families. A few have just one weight and some have 10, some have italics and some not. I don&rsquo;t recommend this way of working, it drives me nuts. I finally squeezed out one lousy font and put it on the market. It was a battle that I had with myself causing anguish and tears. I finally gave up and just released one stinking font just to relieve the pressure of the whole damn mess. My advice is just put one out and add to it later. The longer you wait, the harder it gets to let go.
I have nearly finished seven variations of that font now and three versions of another. I hope I can persevere and get them out on the market soon. Life is not easy and I should know better after all these years.</p>
