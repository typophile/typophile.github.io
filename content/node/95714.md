body: "Hi all - I am looking for a typeface for  mid to upper mid-market jewellery
  brand. The existing typeface uses an extended (as in wide) slab-serif with rounded
  terminals (see attached image). I like the overall feel but I don't like the rounded
  ends - I would prefer something that feels more precise, delicate and elegant.\r\nAny
  suggestions for alternatives would be much appreciated."
