body: "How can I in Indesign CS3 create the multicolored highlights like in the 8VO
  poster below? \r\n\r\nIf i try to bring a red highlight next to black highlight
  the red automatically goes black.\r\n\r\nOne way I found around this problem was
  to give the red and black highlights there own boxes but this can be very inaccurate
  and text is never consistently spaced and lined up.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"

  body: "You could try using Paragraph and Character Styles for the type, and use
    Underlines for the highlights. \r\n\r\nOne paragraph style for the overall font
    style. One Character Style for each kind of highlight. \r\n\r\nTo create the highlight
    (within the Character Style), I'd use \r\n> New Character Style \r\n> Underline
    Options \r\n> Underline (On), Weight (24 pt or similar), Offset (adjust to taste),
    Select Color.\r\n\r\nThen duplicate the Character Style and simply change the
    color of the Underline within the Character Style pop-up, but make sure each successive
    Character Style is based on your original, since if you'd like to change the width
    or offset of the highlights globally, you can do it by changing the original Character
    Style.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
