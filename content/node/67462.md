  heavy use of hierarchy and numbering?\r\n2.0\r\n\r\n2.1\r\n\r\n2.2\r\n\r\nAre there
  any default settings I could use?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n"

  body: "The feature exists, is powerful but works in a very different way than Word's.\r\n\r\nYou
    must create paragraph styles activating the <strong>bullets and numbering</strong>
    options. It's needed one style for each level in your hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSomething
    like this (the capture is in Portuguese, but you can identify the items as their
    position is the same):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/idnumbers_3871.png]\r\n.\r\nIn
    the paragraph style you define the level (n\xEDvel) and set the format. Usually,
    numeration will be continuous whitin a chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen setting second- or
    third-level styles, you need to define where numeration will restart. Here you
    see a second-level paragrapf settings:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/idnumbers2_4392.png]\r\n.\r\nThe
    option I chose makes numeration for second-level titles restart every time a new
    first-level appears. The result is this:\r\n\r\n1. Nononononon\r\n1.1 nononon\r\n1.2
    nononon\r\n2. Nononon <\u2013 a first-level paragraph makes the 2.n numbers restart\r\n2.1
    nononon\r\n2.2 nononon\r\netc.\r\n\r\nPlease note that ID keeps the numerations
    independent. So if you don't have a first-level paragraph in any place on the
    text, the second-level numeration will appear like this:\r\n0.1 nononon\r\n0.2
    nononon\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful feature which lets you apply detailed
    format to numbers apart of the paragraph style itself and build a structured document.
    I suggest you to take a look on the InDesign Help about this feature."
