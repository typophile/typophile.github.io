body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm new to this forum and I wanted to ask a question of the more
  experienced typophiles out there. I was recently involved in a discussion over at
  MyFonts, where a font was identified as Pinto Inline, an undigitised font by Graphic
  Systems (that's what it says in my catalogue anyway).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nA user
  asked for the full set of characters, which I subsequently scanned, badly, from
  a Mecanorama catalogue I had lying around, and uploaded to my Photobucket account.
  \r\n\r\nNow I'd really like to scan that font properly, along with a few other obscure,
  not digitally available ones from that catalogue, and upload them just for the reference
  of those font lovers out there who'd like to see them, many of them have been identified
  at WhatTheFont from scans, logos and the like, but I'm worried that I might be inviting
  trouble. One the one hand, I think they should be seen, but on the other hand I
  don't want unscrupulous folks coming in, digitising them and running away with the
  credit. The catalogue itself isn't even dated, some of the fonts are credited to
  people or foundries, some aren't, I assume Mecanorama owned those, though I'm not
  sure. Should I scan and share with as much credit and copyright info as I can, or
  should I leave them in my bookcase to gather dust, just in case? I feel kind of
  bad having this record here on my coffee table and not being able to share it with
  anyone, but on the other hand, I don't want to be doing anything that verges on
  illegality.\r\n\r\nI'd welcome any advice. Thanks."

  body: Won't you be infringing copyrights when you publish on the internet...? Don't
    get me wrong, I like the idea of making it available to the public domain, but
    you'll probably need approval from Mecanorma/designers/foundries. Having said
    that, I would love to see them! I'm a big fan of old-style Mecanorma and Letraset
    type.

  body: 'I don''t really know, that''s the problem. Is an image of a font a font or
    an image? If someone posts a scan of a complete character set to WhatTheFont and
    asks me what font it is and where they can buy it, which has happened in the past
    few days, and I tell them what font it is, and that''s it''s not digitally available
    but it was designed by so-and-so in the year such-and-such, what has actually
    happened in that exchange that would differ from me posting a complete character
    set to a blog and saying "Hey, I like this font, it was designed by so-and-so
    in the year such-and-such, shame it hasn''t been digitised." Would either of us
    be infringing copyright? Should I refrain from doing that? I''m not even really
    that worried that people/foundries would jump on me for copyright, but that someone
    would take the image and run with it and do a Creampuff, as it were, and that
    that would be my fault. '

  body: 'I''m not looking to reproduce the catalogue itself, though, or even pages
    from the catalogue or any of its layout. Just 8 or 9 fonts from a collection of
    300 from the one section in the catalogue that deals with font transfers, just
    the A-Z 1-0 characters, nothing else on the page. Copyrightwise, wouldn''t they
    be classified more or less as "underlying work" in an anthology, as it were? '
