  script\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete Hebrew alphabet in Rashi script [right to left].\r\nThe
  semi-cursive typeface in which Rashi's commentaries are printed both in the Talmud
  and Tanakh is often referred to as \"Rashi script.\" This does not mean that Rashi
  himself used such a script: the typeface is based on a 15th century Sephardic semi-cursive
  hand. What would be called \"Rashi script\" was employed by early Hebrew typographers
  such as the Soncino family and Daniel Bomberg, a Christian printer in Venice, in
  their editions of commented texts (such as the Mikraot Gedolot and the Talmud, in
  which Rashi's commentaries prominently figure) to distinguish the rabbinic commentary
  from the primary text proper, for which a square typeface was used."
