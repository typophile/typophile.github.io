    of its original width as you can see in the image. The second \"a\" is different.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/electrotome_4823.jpg]"

  body: You did it right yet needs some adjustments, edit the color you want and you
    can have it the way you want it to be. I just finish the name of <a rel="dofollow"
    href="http://putrajaya.theeverlyhotel.com/" title="Putrajaya hotel" style="text-decoration:none;
    color:#000000;">Putrajaya hotel</a> which will be publish the next day. Look for
    it and spot the difference.
