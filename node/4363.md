body: 'I believe everyone faces this issue when choosing type for a magazine or for
  the corporate identity system of a client or, basically, for any design job that
  involves type. <BR> <BR>How do you match the personality of the chosen type with
  the personality of the organization/magazine/etc? <BR> <BR>The only details I&#39;ve
  seen discussed were extremely basic... that is serif goes for serious, traditional
  corporations and sans serif fits like a glove on modern ones. Of course, this is
  a superficial approach. <BR> <BR>I found this article, but it&#39;s a little too
  academic for my taste: <BR><a href="http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/type/utbo412.htm"

  body: Marius, although it&#39;s possible to &#34;rationally&#34; recommend certain
    fonts for certain types of work, it seems much much harder to come up with canned
    &#34;rules&#34; that can applied to this task. <BR> <BR>&#62; <a href="http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/type/utbo412.htm"
