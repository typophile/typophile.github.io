  body: ' An exercise in vertical stress, eh? <BR> <BR>For the most part, I think
    they work very well. The &#34;2&#34; is grating on me slightly, but I think it&#39;s
    only due to me being used to seeing the thick stroke/thin stroke distribution
    attuned to more horizontal stress. It does seem a trifle thick at the top of the
    main stroke, though, compared to the &#34;6&#34; and the bottom of the &#34;9&#34;.
    The thicker tapers of the ends of the &#34;3&#34; work a bit better, due I think
    to the tighter nature of the curves &#40;that may temper somewhat my criticism
    of the &#34;2&#34; -- but not completely <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> &#41;. Take another look at the &#34;2&#34;, in any event. Perhaps
    a tighter angle between the main stroke and the base may be an alternate solution.
    <BR> <BR>The gentle curve and taper of the &#34;4&#34; is really elegant, and
    plays well off of the &#34;7&#34;. In fact, I think I&#39;d like to see more of
    the &#34;4&#34;&#39;s taper and curve incorporated into the &#34;7&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>While you said that these figures were intended for text sizes, I can envision
    them as attractive display numerals as well. They&#39;d also look great cut out
    of metal. Very nice. '

  body: ' The Arabic writing system has horizontal stress, <BR>and that&#39;s the
    origin of the Latin numerals. The thing is, in the &#34;conventional&#34; Latin
    scheme the &#34;2&#34; and &#34;5&#34; have a mix of h and v stress, the &#34;7&#34;
    is mostly &#40;sometimes entirely&#41; h, the &#34;4&#34; has this wierd diagonal,
    and the rest are all v stress. Watduhel?! I&#39;m actually a big fan of variation,
    but this is just arbitrary &#40;in the same way that so many typographic traditions
    are&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried to bring a method to the madness, but I&#39;m
    actually just as unhappy with the &#34;2&#34; as you are. I think/hope that the
    &#34;5&#34; and &#34;4&#34; work great, and the &#34;7&#34; would work better
    in a serif face &#40;where it could get a beak -and maybe foot serifs- to fill
    the void&#41;. <BR> <BR>The &#34;2&#34; might just need to be wider. Or maybe
    you&#39;re right that the diagonal needs to become straight&#91;er&#93; &#40;and
    thinner&#41; at the bottom &#40;instead of turning back&#41;. Another thing about
    the &#34;2&#34; is that it has a stiff spine &#40;with a totally straight segment
    in there&#41;, and maybe that ruins it. <BR> <BR>BTW, great idea about making
    the &#34;7&#34;&#39;s diagonal echo the &#34;4&#34;&#39;s more &#40;at the top&#41;.

  body: ' Indeed.... I had to fight my first impulse to ask for a thinning at the
    top of the curve of the &#34;2&#34;, and a thickening of its base stroke. <IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> I have been
    intrigued by your previous challenges to the conventional mixed-stress figure
    structure, and I think what you are doing here with uniformly vertical stress
    is equally interesting. <BR> <BR>Hmmm... On looking at it a second time, maybe
    the &#34;2&#34; could benefit from the same curve &#40;if not the taper&#41; that
    you used in the &#34;4&#34; &#40;and will apply to the &#34;7&#34;&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;5&#34; does indeed work very well, as, I think, does the &#34;3&#34;.
    In fact, I very much like the slight downturn of the middle vertex of the &#34;3&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>I keep looking at the &#34;6&#34; and &#34;9&#34; as well, but I can&#39;t
    put my finger on why. Then again, I&#39;m never quite satisfied with those figures
    in my own fonts either. The curves required in those two figures are deceptively
    complex, and difficult to keep balanced.... <BR> <BR>In any event, keep it up.
    I&#39;m interested to see the continuing results. '

  body: ' The more I think about this, the more I get confused...  :-/ <BR> <BR>I
    can build a set of &#34;normal&#34; numerals and make them work 90%, but I won&#39;t
    really be happy until I can justify what I&#39;ve made. Imitating precedent has
    its merits, but doing so because of intellectual sloth is just... sucky. <BR>
    <BR>Why give the numerals consistent vertical stress? Does it help low-level readability,
    or does it just satisfy our Modernist desire for Regularity? It&#39;s the former
    that intrigues me most, but I think in the latter I at least have a safety net:
    giving the numerals v stress makes them visually harmonious with the alphabetic
    glyphs. The question is, do they &#42;reduce&#42; readability?... <BR> <BR>The
    thing is, no glyph is pure text or pure display. During my &#34;Alphabet Reform&#34;
    project I realized that you simply cannot &#42;show&#42; structures: they can
    only be &#42;explained&#42; &#40;something graphic designers don&#39;t seem to
    like to do, btw&#41;. That&#39;s why &#34;theoretical&#34; alphabets &#40;like
    Bayer&#39;s &#34;Universal&#34;&#41; are always ugly - they have to be seen as
    a conceptual compromise, not usable things. <BR> <BR>So any actual glyphs I make/show
    inescapably represent parts of an actual font, something that can be used at different
    sizes, in different ways. Among other things, this brings the conflict between
    aesthetics and functionality to the fore. Specifically: my &#34;2&#34;&#39;s spine
    makes it structurally divergent from some other numerals, which makes it more
    legible; my &#34;1&#34; has that ugly bar because it helps pull it away from the
    UC &#34;I&#34; and lc &#34;el&#34;; my &#34;3&#34; has a sag in its waist because
    that makes it more of a 3 &#40;and not because Garamond did it&#41;; and many
    other such machinations. <BR> <BR>So your/my ideas for making the &#34;2&#34;
    more pleasing would make it less legible. Legibility isn&#39;t everything, and
    I sacrifice it myself sometimes &#40;for example, that &#34;8&#34; is not ideal,
    but the &#34;optimal&#34; structure I have in mind is simply too ugly&#41;, but
    knowing where to strike the balance depends on so many factors! For example, if
    these numerals were meant for marking addresses on houses, the &#34;1&#34;&#39;s
    bar would go. But if they were meant for telephone books, I would dig out my ugly
    &#34;8&#34;. <BR> <BR>The more versatile you make a face, the less well it will
    perform in specific applications. Look at Tracy&#39;s Adsans. It&#39;s ugly, but
    man, does it ever &#42;work&#42;. <BR> <BR>Speaking of other existing fonts, I
    was looking through the Rookledge Typefinder &#40;again...&#41;, and I actually
    found a font that implements v stress for numerals in a largely pleasing way:
    Egyptian 505. And who designed &#40;or at least directed&#41; it? Gurtler, one
    of my very favorite designers!  :-&#41; <BR>&#40;BTW, Gill I worship, but his
    attempts at v-stress numerals I can&#39;t stand to look at.&#41; <BR> <BR>On the
    other side of the spectrum, there are also fonts &#40;though very rare&#41; which
    give horizontal stress to the &#42;alphabetics&#42;! Like Excoffon&#39;s Olive,
    of course, but also Bloemsma&#39;s Balance. What&#39;s interesting is that they
    also make &#42;all&#42; the numerals have h stress. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Courage, Camille. :D <BR> <BR>Your point about balancing aesthetics and
    legibility is well taken. I&#39;d be curious to see the two different extremes
    as applied to this design. Dig out that ugly &#34;8&#34;, as well as the rest
    of the discarded alternates, and parade them for us. <BR> <BR>I often find when
    constructing a font that the glyphs that I think aren&#39;t working are simply
    reacting badly with other glyphs that are the real culprits. Also, sometimes when
    I think a glyph isn&#39;t working, it turns out to be simply my discomfort with
    a design that I&#39;m not used to, but the design itself turns out to work very
    well, thank you very much. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like what all those folks at Emigre
    keep saying: We read best what we read most. Or something like that. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;">  Legibility borrows a great deal from familiarity. The moral &#40;if
    there is one&#41; may be, without overstating it: don&#39;t discard an innovation
    because it is unfamiliar. I think what you&#39;re attempting is worth the investigation,
    and I think you&#39;re getting somewhere with it. <BR> <BR>I also think you may
    be right about the &#34;6&#34; and &#34;9&#34;. As I look at them today, they
    work. And I think that&#39;s a splendid example of the point in my previous paragraph.

    an 8 from a font I did about two years ago. I think it&#39;s &#42;structurally&#42;

    ALT="opti_8.gif"> <BR> <BR>Now, when it comes to familiarity, I agree that it&#39;s
    important. But I also think too many designers use Emigre&#39;s mantra as an escape
    from having to look the beast that is Readability in the eye. You can&#39;t just
    make whatever shape that turns you on, if you care about reading comfort: there
    are realities about our retina, our brain, etc. which make some fonts inherently
    less readable than others. For one thing, the reason there&#39;s a difference
    between legibility and readability is proof that familiarity cannot be all-important.
    <BR> <BR>This doesn&#39;t mean I or anybody else understands -or can ever understand-
    readability completely. But &#42;that&#42; doesn&#39;t mean we should try to understand
    it more. It might not be very sexy, but you don&#39;t marry the sexiest person
    you know. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a big champion of innovation, but only when it makes
    things better for users/readers, not to stroke my own ego. There are so many stale,
    dysfunctional traditions in typography - they have to be fixed. But too many designers
    think of themselves are &#34;artiste&#34;s, and are too afraid/lazy/dumb to consider
    the intricacies of immersive reading. These people will never make a real text
    font. <BR> <BR>Lastly, about your &#34;conversion&#34; on the 6/9: <BR>I believe
    in the separation of conscious observation of shapes versus the quick-and-dirty
    reality of our subconscious reading mechanism. What does this mean? It means that
    a layman simply cannot look at a glyph and declare if it&#39;s highly readable
    or not - we cannot hope to understand our subconscious directly. For example,
    there have been many tests done asking readers to choose the most readable font
    out of a set, then they measure the actual reading speeds of the various fonts.
    Invariably, the most readable font is smaller than the one readers think is best.
    What the readers are consciously choosing actually has to do with &#42;legibility&#42;,
    not readbaility. And the two have a congruence of only about 50%. <BR> <BR>So,
    how can we find out if a given glyph works or doesn&#39;t? 1&#41; Do a lot of
    good field testing. 2&#41; Simply &#42;think&#42; about it as much as possible
    &#40;instead of running away saying &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter&#34;&#41;, using
    your understanding of how humans read. That&#39;s Craft. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    Hrant, as the conventional stress, or rather lack of stress, is aesthetically
    horrible. When it comes to readability, it seems that you know much more than

    it would reduce legibility by reducing variation&#41; as it calms down and strictens
    the overall impression &#40;and so the readers mind&#41; and sets the focus on
    individual variation. It seems to me that readability is much about regularity

  body: 'First, Anders, thanks for your encouragement - I happen to need it right
    now... <BR> <BR>My understanding of readability is still shallow. The only real
    credit I can take &#40;and am proud to take&#41; is that unlike many designers
    I &#42;care&#42; about readability. <BR> <BR>About your suggestion for the &#34;4&#34;:
    <BR>I&#39;ve always liked open-top &#34;4&#34;s, but they kind of stop working
    well in darker weights. <BR> <BR>As for the advantages of straight versus curve,
    that&#39;s a very interesting line of thought. In terms of legibility of numerals
    you want each number to be as different as possible &#40;as you implied&#41;,
    so a totally straight-lined &#34;4&#34; is best. But in terms of readability,
    no glyph should stand out too much in terms of &#42;structure&#42; &#40;even though
    I&#39;m still unsure about the merits of totally even color&#41;. For example,
    I think the conventional lc &#34;g&#34; &#40;the bicameral one with the closed
    descender&#41; is too different from the rest of the alphabet: I make my text
    &#34;g&#34;s with an open descender. In fact that&#39;s the best justification
    for making all the numerals completely v-stressed. <BR> <BR>The &#34;6&#34;/&#34;9&#34;:
    I&#39;m starting to think they need to be open, like you said. For one thing,
    it&#39;s better for legibility. <BR> <BR>The &#34;1&#34;: I thought the bar at
    the foot was ugly... But now I think the top&#39;s ugly too! What to do? <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;7&#34;: Putting full serifs at its foot might seem logical to you
    and me &#40;both aesthetically and functionally&#41;, but for some reason very
    few people seem to do it that way... Another stale convention? <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m
