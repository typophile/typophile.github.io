  here and there for the past few months or so...\r\n\r\nI'm a student whose working
  on a book about theater in San Francisco, and I've been struggling with getting
  my previous work for the topic, to read as \"theater\". I've decided to scrap nearly
  everything I've worked on up until this point, and I've decided to shoot for a vaudeville
  aesthetic because vaudeville always seems to capture that theatrical essence that
  resides in most people. Plus, \"vaudeville conquered the West\" as they say...\r\n\r\nSo,
  I was wondering if you can point me into the right direction with regards to typefaces?
  Currently, I've been experimenting with Copperplater and a font called Vonfont,
  but I know there are loads more.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)\r\n\r\n~C"

  body: The question is, which Vaudeville aestetic? It's rather different in the late
    19th century compared to the Jazz age! :) For the 19th-century stuff (which gels
    rather well with many people's idea of vaudeville today), [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/|Letterhead
    Fonts]] has a good range of display types, but perhaps [[http://www.trocadero.com/rogerbradbury/items/1041909/en1.html|this
    sort of thing]] with  grotesque woodtype (or similar) would make an interesting
    alternative?

  body: "Thank you so much for your responses! I would have responded sooner, but
    I'm currently battling some computer issues :s\r\n\r\nThe era I'm shooting for
    is the turn of the century (roughly, 1906-1920). I can't believe I neglected to
    narrow that down in my OP T_T. \r\n\r\nSo far, I've narrowed it down some of my
    typefaces: Egyptienne Black, Bodini Poster, and Didone. I've been experimenting
    around with some other typefaces, more artful ones anyway. I'll post my end results
    in the next few weeks!"

  body: "Those are probably wood type.\r\nI wouldn't worry too much about exactly
    matching such fonts.\r\nIf you use any bold ultra-condensed (compressed too) styles
    in that kind of \"set to fit\" layout, the effect will be sufficient."

  body: You have a point, Nick. I was looking at Geometric 415 and experiment with
    it. I was trying to use Univers, but something about it didn't quite look right.
