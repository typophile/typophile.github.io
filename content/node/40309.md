body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Expert Set Font</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  \"Expert Set\" is a character set invented by Adobe around 1990, which includes
  Latin [[small caps]], oldstyle [[figures|figure]], a set of five f [[ligature|ligatures]]
  (fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl), fractions and superiors. In the original meaning, an \"Expert
  Set font\" has exactly these characters, and supplements a \"regular\" character
  set font.\r\n\r\nExpert Set fonts from other type foundries usually have the same
  standard character set, but some foundries have used the phrase to denote other
  \ specialized charater sets, which may or may not have some overlap with the standardized
  \"expert set.\"\r\n\r\nExpert set fonts are becoming less common with advent of
  [[OpenType]] which allows for these extras to be included in the same font that
  contains the default glyphs, accessed more easily, and inserted into a layout without
  damaging the underlying text."
