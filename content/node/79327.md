  body: "I don't think Avant Garde Gothic was involved,  although the angled A's are
    reminiscent of it. I would guess this is custom, but a place to look is the Techno>Scifi
    category at Dafont.com. There may be something similar that could be modified
    to match your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
