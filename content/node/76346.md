  body: "This Guide is presented to help in the identification of the many typefaces
    that are similar (by design or accident) to the design originally created by the
    Austrian-born Herbert Bayer in 1925 when he was head of the workshop of Graphic
    Design and Printing at the Bauhaus school of architecture and art in Dessau. The
    simple, direct, geometric look of this art movement was helping to define the
    look of an era. Perhaps most famous for its influence on architecture, particularly
    in the buildings of Walter Gropius, Bauhaus \"style\" was applied to many areas,
    including furniture, industrial and graphic design, and printing. Bayer, like
    many artists and designers, fled the Nazis and left Germany in 1938. He came to
    the United States, continuing his career in graphic design. He died in 1985 in
    California. (This information came mainly from \"Rookledge's International Handbook
    of Type Designers - A Biographical Directory\" by Ron Eason & Sarah Rookledge.)\r\n\r\nTwo
    additional websites with material about the Bauhaus are: Bauhaus by Greg Flores
    and the Bauhaus-Archiv Museum (this site is in German, maintained by today's Bauhaus
    School). The latter site includes many pictures and detailed history, much of
    which can be appreciated, even without much knowledge of German. (My special thanks
    to \"Aenor\" from the alt.binaries.fonts (ABF) newsgroup for these links and some
    of the font samples. Thanks also to Melinda Windsor on ABF for font suggestions.)\r\n\r\nThe
    reason for putting up this exhibition is the renewed popularity of this style,
    as shown by the many font ID requests on newsgroups comp.fonts and alt.binaries.fonts
    by people looking for a font like one of these. In the current fashion of geometrically
    simple \"Techno\" fonts, these typefaces suddenly look \"new\" again. Funny, how
    styles can go in cycles, isn't it? There's also a quote about history repeating
    itself, isn't there? ( I also provide a free font ID service, if what you are
    looking for isn't in these samples.)\r\n\r\nThe typefaces on this page begin with
    probably the most famous Bauhaus type of them all, ITC Bauhaus, designed by Ed
    Benguiat and Victor Caruso in 1975. I have included samples from fonts that I
    have in my collection (I don't sell fonts -- I use them in my graphics designs),
    but there are many other typefaces that resemble the Bauhaus look. Some of those
    font images were scanned from books I have listed among my \"References\" and
    also from provider's font samples. Other font images were generously provided
    by friends from the font newsgroups. I know I may be stretching the resemblances,
    but I picked these faces as ones that made use of the same (or similar) geometric
    shapes used in Bauhaus. \r\n\r\n\r\n___________________\r\nMyname:mrtuan |my site:<a
