		<div class="commentbody">Nothing exists in a pure state. Not Democracy, not Capitalism, not Monarchy. What people <i>think</i> is the main thing. Americans are willing to kill Iraqis to force them to adopt democracy. Why? Because it goes along with the package: TV, Capitalism, McDonalds, the works. <BR> <BR>A benign monarch serves much more of the population than any other system. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s good that you dislike Capitalism, but you also have to realize that it subverts everything to its will. Democracy for example is used to give the illusion of power, hence reducing real power. And public education is used to brainwash. And freedom of speech is the best way to reduce <i>desire for action</i>. etc. etc. etc. The whole Western experiment of society is failing, face it. What do you expect when the whole thing is descended from a people who raped women with bulls in front of thousands of paying spectators? The West teaches respect for the Romans - barbarians. <BR> <BR>BTW, I don&#39;t vote. I&#39;m not qualified, and it validates this murderous system. I will have nothing to do with it, except follow the least amount of laws to avoid personal hardship. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

You can&#39;t vote the system out, which is much the same thing that Americans criticise non-democratic countries for.  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;but democracy &#40;okay, federalism&#41; is the best  <BR>&#62;&#62;thing for an imperfect set of corruptible people. That&#39;s all  <BR>&#62;&#62;of us, and I think our collective human history proves it. <BR> <BR>I disagree - I think our history proves just that in certain historical contexts, countries which include some democratic elements in their political systems are often less brutal, and less directly controlling towards their own citizens &#40;though not those of other countries&#41; than other types of regime. <BR>This is due to the relationship &#40;historical, not inherent&#41; between democracy and capitalism.  Capitalism requires a highly complex and flexible society to function at its best, and the blunt, unsophisticated and brutal feudal/monarchical regimes of the past &#40;and in some places, the present&#41; are just not capable of this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John H: <BR>&#34;The term &#39;natural law&#39; is not mystical, it has been part of the vocabulary of western philosophy for hundreds of years. The use of the term in the manner you describe is a later development, and in my opinion a misleading one. What you are referring to are so called &#39;laws&#39; of nature, i.e. properties and relationships of the physical universe. Natural law refers to the idea that morality is not culturally specific or an invention of human intelligence, but refers to objective truths. For a fuller explanation, see the Natural Law entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or the Catholic Encyclopedia &#40;the latter acnowledges that in English &#39;this term is frequently employed as equivalent to the laws of nature&#39;&#41;.&#34; <BR> <BR>Forgive me--I&#39;m a finite being. I&#39;m interested in how theism can &#39;jive&#39; with a concept of morality that is independent of god. According to your stance is morality completely independent of god? <BR>If no, then it is an appeal to a moral authority. <BR>If yes, then would it be immoral to quit worshipping god? </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Every human being experiences and interprets the universe differently. &#39;Truth&#39; and &#39;Reality&#39; are subjective.</i> <BR> <BR>That sounds like an objective truth claim to me. Can you prove that truth and reality are subjective? Are they ontologically subjective, or only subjectively subjective? <BR> <BR>It is a fallacy to proceed from difference of individual experience and interpretation to difference in that which is experienced. Interpretation does not create reality: reality exists outside of experience and interpretation. Our interpretation of reality may vary, but this does not mean that reality varies, as people who throw themselves off cliffs in the belief that they won&#39;t fall soon realise.  <BR> <BR><i>Ask 10 witnesses what they saw during the supermarket robbery. Ask them to define &#39;reality&#39; or &#39;justice&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;.</i> <BR> <BR>The Rashomon effect -- of literary rather than judicial fame -- demonstrates the faultiness of human memory and perception. The fact that 10 witnesses to a robbery recall different details of the robbery does not mean that different robberies with different details took place: a single, unique robbery with specific details took place. The reality of the robbery is a complex event that happens and which people under duress and fear at the time are later asked to recall. The fact that their recollections of the reality of the event may differ tells us more about the human mind at times of stress than about the nature of reality. <BR> <BR>We are very seldom called upon in practical ethics to <i>define</i> terms like &#39;justice&#39;, let alone &#39;reality&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;. The task is not to define, but to exercise, and the vast majority of people have an innate sense of justice that allows them to understand and respond appropriately to complex moral problems. Most people are capable, for example, of understanding that robbing a supermarket is wrong, but that justice requires that we consider the way in which the robbery took place &#40;were weapons used? were people threatened? was anyone hurt?&#41;, the quantifiable aspect of the crime &#40;were all the tills emptied? or was only a loaf of bread stolen?&#41;, and extenuating circumstances &#40;was the perpetrator under pressure to commit the crime, e.g. was he or someone else threatened if he did not? was he hungry and took only what he needed to feed himself? is he mentally capable of understanding that his actions were criminal?&#41; These are the sort of things that people deal with every day, without needing to define &#39;justice&#39; and without getting their knickers in a twist about reality or truth. <BR> <BR>In the realm of ethics and morality we may debate and disagree about what is good or evil in a given situation, but the foundation of natural law is that we all understand that morality consists, as St Thomas Aquinas put it, in &#39;doing good and avoiding evil&#39;. Different individuals and different cultures may differ as to what consitutes good and evil, but there has never been a society that identified morality as doing evil and avoiding good. I happen to think that human sacrifice is evil, but the cultures that practised human sacrifice did not and, indeed, considered it a positive good. But the definition of morality is no subjective: those who practice human sacrifice still hold that morality consists of doing what is good andavoiding what is evil. This is the basis of natural law. None of this implies in itself that human sacrifice is either good or evil, although I think few people would advance arguments that it is good, but it implies very strongly that an idea of morality is universal and &#39;hard wired&#39; into our nature. Of course, this implies that we have a nature: a real, true, ontological nature. <BR> <BR>Experiencing and intepreting reality does not constitute creating reality. Of course we subjectively experience and interpret reality, but the reality we experience and interpret is objective. The subjectivity is all in your head. The fact that your head -- and your subjectively experiencing and interpreting mind -- are <i>part of the objective reality</i> limits both the reasonable extent of subjectivity &#40;the point at which we cease to be rational and observational and become mad and delusional&#41; and quite severely limits the degree to which subjective experience and intepretation varies from person to person. For example, studies in eyesight confirm that excepting variance &#40;colour blindness, short-sightedness, etc.&#41; we all <i>physically</i> see the same things; this puts considerable limits on our subjective interpretation of what we see. I may disagree with my fellow witnesses as to whether the supermarket robber was wearing a blue or green jacket, but we&#39;re unlikely to disagree about whether there was an elephant present. <BR> <BR> <BR>You know, I think I&#39;ve probably contributed &#40;more than&#41; enough to this thread.</div>

But any monarch needs advisors - whom he can select and dismiss at his discrection.  <BR> <BR>OK, we&#39;re getting somewhere now - your monarch would be rich with money inherited from theives several generations removed, intelligent and have &#39;good parents&#39;. <BR>Once in power they, with the help of their hand-picked advisors, would have absolute power to make and unmake laws. <BR>But the laws they could make would exclude certain types of law. <BR>They couldn&#39;t, for example, make a law giving themselves the effective monopoly of legitimate use of force that governments of all types usually assume as their right.

		<div class="commentbody">Matha: <BR>&#62;&#62;I think you were probably hoping for something on a national level, but there you go <BR>I was thinking of the national level - the problem with local level democracy in the context of national un-democracy, is that its difficult to tell what&#39;s working and what isn&#39;t as areas of influence overlap.  &#40;Is Mr X free because his local mayor allows him a license to run a bar, gamble on a sunday, set hounds on a hare etc, or is he unfree because the national government taxes drinking and gambling and bans cruelty to hares?&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;OK, that&#39;s a crap example, but I&#39;ve been playing cricket and drinking all evening and now I want to go to bed soon - hopefully you get my drift&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;And do explain why democracy doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m all ears.  <BR> <BR>OK, briefly, before we can say that a country enjoys democracy, we must satisfy ourselves that certain conditions are met.  Exactly what these conditions are is debatable, for some a free press, or the rights of free association and free speech are important, for others access to mass media is a big thing.  No one really agrees on much, but one thing that all agree on is that democracy has to be founded on a parliament &#40;legislature&#41; or at least a government &#40;executive&#41; which has been chosen by the population in free and fair elections. <BR> <BR>In Britain, for example, we have elections where 60% of those who vote, vote for a losing candidate, where governing parties can remain in power with the votes of as little as 28% of the electorate, where most successful candidates have more people voting against them than for them.&#40;These are not controversial figures, they are from the freely available official returns&#41; <BR>There is no excuse for such a system, and even less for calling it democratic.  It is like this party because there is a relatively strong third party in the UK, partly because UK elections officially perform the task of providing each area wiht its own representative in parliament but mostly because to change it, you would have to win an election under this system, and no-one wants to change a system that makes them a winner. <BR> <BR>In the US presedential election its even worse - there they have no local representation - everyone is voting for a single president, nor are there significant 3rd parties, its just a straight 2-way fight, but still they come up with a ridiculous system which sometimes means that the candidate with the fewest votes wins. <BR> <BR>There are some systems which are less poor, but none which translate the will of the people into the policies of the government.  Its not that hard, it should be the easy bit of achieving democracy, leaving us with the difficult bit of deciding on and implementing the other requirements, but no-where in the world &#40;as far as I know&#41; does a whole nation, of significant size, use a democratic electoral system.</div>

Fantasy? Conspiracy? Mass delusion? The Matrix? <BR> <BR>We experience a physical and temporal reality, and the consensus of our <i>observation</i> of that reality derive from a remarkably similar physiognomy of senses shared by beings that are, after all, a single species. We are not collectively inventing reality by consensus any more than we are individually inventing reality by subjective interpretation: we are inhabiting reality, of which we are a part. Yes, even you Matha, are real.</div>

The BBC duly and dutifully filmed this event - after all their job is to report on the events happening in the world. <BR>The problem is that if there had been no cameras to film the event, there would have been no event for the cameras to film.  Thatcher had said that she would only go if the footage would make the early evening news. <BR>So were the BBC reporting on a news event, or making a news event to report on? <BR> <BR> <BR>HHP: <BR>&#62;&#62;Your questions are good <BR> <BR>But not rhetorical...any answers yet?</div>
