body: "Recently, I was hired to do the layout for a magazine. Three days past the
  deadline, I still hadn\u2019t gotten half the content. How would you deal with these
  kind of situations? I eventually got everything, but had to finish the job a lot
  quicker than I had planned, causing the quality to drop. Would you ask for more
  money when the client breach the contract (if specified beforehand)? Is it an option
  to keep the advance and just tell them you can\u2019t finish the job when it\u2019s
  not taken seriously?\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love your opinions.\r\n\r\n(Please forgive
  my poor English!)"

  body: "Hm, I guess it depends a lot on the client and your relationship to them;
    the contract (if any); and of course the assignment and context. \r\nFWIW I just
    had the same thing happen, except I got everything 2 weeks! late, which would
    have made it completely impossible for me to finish on time. So I talked to the
    client, and we ended up moving my deadline back by 2 weeks as well. That of course
    is an ideal situation, but I try to always build relationships with my clients
    where I can talk to them on a no-BS level. Helps in situations such as this."

  body: Put a line in your contract noting that a rush fee will be charged if the
    content is not delivered on time to finish the work. Also be sure that you have
    a kill fee in case the client pulls a job and reassigns it to internal staff who
    can be forced to finish it over a weekend.

  body: "Seems like par for the course. The nature of design is that -- on any given
    project -- you are often working with many different people, departments, and
    3rd parties. It is often out of anyone's ability to control the situation.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are a good designer who can consistently line up clients, at any one time
    you should be waiting on a few clients for material/feedback, and you should have
    a few clients waiting ON YOU to finish their work. That way, if a client has delays,
    you can give them some time without taking a financial hit.\r\n\r\nWaiting on
    a client with nothing in the queue is definitely bad resource management for a
    designer. Of course, I am the first to admit that it's hard to juggle doing work
    and marketing my services. In fact, I'm terrible at it. :-)"

  body: 'All of these are good options. Create a production schedule ahead of time.
    Indicate that each day late pushes back your delivery date, and/or add a rush
    fee when materials are late. I wouldn''t walk away from the job unless you absolutely
    don''t care to work with them again. And try to work with your clients, sometimes
    things happen, you may need an extra day of time too at some point. And communicate
    with them ahead of time, when a deadline is coming up remind them about your policy. '

  body: "Great advice. Thanks! I\u2019m all for clear communication and building good
    relationships with clients. Still, guarding my love for design is very important
    to me. Sometimes declining a job, even though the money is good, pays off in the
    long run."
