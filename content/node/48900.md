    about everything that they sell. You can also get dates for some stuff on Myfonts,
    although sometimes those end up being dates for the revival and not the original. '

    this several times and was planning on using it along with other sources to draw

    to pdf fiction - somewhat like straight to dvd movies. Call it anti-vanity press.
    Self-published or published on the web with no intention of getting anything out
    of it other than the the satisfaction of having done it. "

  body: "Correction:\r\nMy memory of the graph was overly rosy. After reading that
    original thread of mine, I realize that it's actually based on pseudo-data. I'd
    have to dig up the book to see exactly what the author did.\r\n\r\nNow, some of
    you would (and in fact are) implying that that's worthless, but I don't agree.
    There's a place for charts based on pseudo-data: they help explain things, if
    only things colored by the author. In fact in some cases they can be more useful
    than charts based on real data.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if \"chartjunk\" really
    means that. I have the (first) Tufte book, but I don't feel like digging it up
    right now. I thought it means charts that have frivolous features, like 3D for
    its own sake, etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Patrick, in that your question asks for <em> periods of use</em> rather than
    <em>dates of design,</em> Hrant's first graph probably fulfills your requirement
    exactly. Otherwise there is <a href="http://www.100types.com/100types.com.timeline.html">this</a>
    and it's free.

  body: "More garbage.\r\n\r\nChartjunk was the wrong word, Tufte uses it to describe
    unnecessary decoration.\r\n\r\nHe called charts not based on data \"relational\",
    for instance, showing the time-based maturation of a seed into a plant.\r\nHe
    also speaks of \"distortion\", when the visual does not match the data.\r\n\r\nSo
    these time-line charts are relational, because the choice of typefaces is not
    based on statistical data, but is rather based on a subjective interpretation
    of history. In as much as they purport to represent actual data, they are fiction.\r\n"

  body: "Certainly \"visualization of ideas\" is too long.\r\n\r\nThe y-axis would
    be based on usage of the typeface in book publications and/or the number of people
    who bought matrices/fonts of the typeface, etc. It could also be based on something
    like an authoritative typeface historian saying something like \"the adoption
    of Caslon climbed steeply until the 1760s, after which it lost its appeal very
    gradually, becoming largely ignored after the turn of the century\".\r\n\r\n*
    For example I do know of quantitative measurements of typeface selection based
    on the \"50 best books\" competitions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
