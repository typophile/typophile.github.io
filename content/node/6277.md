body: Now this one I think is beautiful... It is from Suite magazine, a free magazine
  here in Barcelona. In the back they list their type as Suite, Borneo, Luomo, Maeda,
  interpol, Xquare, SuiteSerif, Interfunctionnen, bonus plus and block. the designers
  name is Inigo Jerez. Does anyone know who he is and if he sells his font? I don&#39;t
  see much record of him on the internet. Suite is beautiful.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47157.gif"

    I can&#39;t tell if any of the fonts are for sale nor can I see actual showings
    of them.
