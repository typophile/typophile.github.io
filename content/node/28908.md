  Pinggera comes from Southern Tyrol, the German-speaking region in northern [[Italy]].
  Realizing that the letters interested him more than the medium, he apprenticed to
  the typesetting and graphic design department of a newspaper in Bolzano. In 1993
  he went to Munich where he worked with [[Gert Wiescher]], and a year later he moved
  on to [[MetaDesign]] in [[Berlin]] to assist [[Luc(as) de Groot]] in the type department.
  In 1995 Albert moved to The Hague for the postgraduate course in type design and
  typography at the [[Royal Academy of Art]]. After graduating cum laude in 1997 he
  returned to Italy, to the mountain town of St. Leonhard in Passeier, and founded
  the company [[design.buero]]. Clients range from local institutions to multinationals
  and the work is varied: custom typeface design, concept/design/production of complex
  book projects, designing exhibit spaces and signage systems, corporate identities,
  etc. From 1998\u20132002 Albert Pinggera taught and gave seminars on type and typography
  in Bolzano. In 2003 Albert Pinggera\u2019s [[FF Strada]] was a winning entry of
