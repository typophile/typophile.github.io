  my [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/oksana/|Oksana typeface]]. it is my
  first attempt to draw greek alphabet, i try to do my best and make it corresponding
  to existing cyrillic and latin scripts, but i need some help from advisors. please
  look at pictures below and say something\r\n\r\nthank you and happy new year ))\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr_01_5473.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr_02_4307.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr_03_4062.png]"

  body: "Excellent work!\r\nSome notes/suggestions from me as well:\r\n\r\n1. I would
    continue the right side of Pi's arm, in a way similar to pi. It seems quite out
    of balance like that.\r\n2. I agree with praitsidis note about zeta (it could
    look more like the bottom bowl of xi).\r\n3. I would lengthen the terminal of
    delta a little more (to the right). And maybe shorten the eye of delta a little
    bit (make it a little smaller than omicron).\r\n4. I would shorten the middle
    stem of omega and maybe close it more from the right side.\r\n5. I would make
    the top bowl of xi more round (now it seems as if it's falling). Maybe raise the
    middle juncture a little bit.\r\n\r\nAgain, excellent work. I can't wait for its
    release.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr"

  body: "This is very charming!\r\n\r\nI'm no Greek expert, but being very much involved
    in [anti-]Latinization I'd emphasize what Petros said about the \"a\".\r\n\r\nAlso,
    from a purely formal level:\r\n- The bars coming out of the lc theta are bothersome.\r\n-
    People might tell you that the weight contrast in the lc mu is wrong, but I personally
    think it works fine.\r\n- The UC Xi is too crowded. Although the classic \"three
    bars\" form would be too awkward, some gap might be useful. Try simply removing
    the horizontal segment!\r\n- The lc xi is leaning rightward.\r\n- The UC Sigma
    needs some thinning at the joins.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the spacing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I like the look'n feel of the light text sample very much - modern but classical.
    My suggestions and comments:\r\n1. The alpha looks ok for me, I've seen that variant
    in Greece, but I'm not a native greek reader. I think since your latin a is double-storey
    it looks different enough.\r\n2. Agree with G30 (sorry, couldn't help ;-) on Pi.
    The current one looks like a Tl ligature.\r\n3. The top left spur on Beta (and
    Pi) looks a bit long - Gamma is ok.\r\n4. The Delta is imho too \"cyrillic\".
    (Same for Lambda) I'd use the A as a pattern. What about softening the bottom
    left corner (like in Sigma).\r\n5. Widen the right gap of the Sigma a bit more.\r\n6.
    The bottom curl of the Tau looks out of order. It is not in Gamma, Iota or Rho.\r\n7.
    Agree with hrant on theta. The style of your typeface would go well with an open
    one.\r\n8. I think the top spurs of zeta and xi should be similar.\r\n9. Ah yes,
    and the Xi - imho better without the connecting diagonals.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Lowercase chi is supposed to descend. I don't know if modern Greek commonly
    accepts x for chi, but I think the traditional form would better fit your design
    even so.\r\n\r\nI agree that the open-form theta would work better, but as regards
    the closed-form theta, I disagree and think the bar sticking through is good in
    this face. As with phi, a thorough font should include both forms as alternates.
    So, yeah, make an open phi too."

    was very useful for me.\r\n\r\nso, i redrawn some letters:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr_letters_6477.gif]\r\n\r\n*
    Delta and Lambda go a bit more triangular for now (de-Cyrillization))\r\n* Xi
    in 'three horizontals' shape: is asymmetric design possible at all?\r\n* shorter
    verticals in Phi and a bit wider Upsilon\r\n* Pi without round corner and\r\n*
    Sigma without upper right serif\r\n\r\n* more round oval in alpha\r\n* a bit smaller
    oval and longer tail in delta \r\n* similar shapes for zeta and xi\r\n* shorter
    horizontal ends in theta (but i still want to use its)\r\n\r\nand i added some
    alternative characters:\r\n* diagonaled Xi, round Epsilons (just copies from ukrainian
    -\u0404-\u0454- letters)\r\n* round beta, theta and phi\r\n* long legged chi\r\n\r\nhere
    is normal text sample\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gr_text01_4765.gif]\r\n\r\nand

  body: "I just discovered this. It's great that you are extending Oksana to include
    Greek!\r\n\r\nThe redrawn shapes look good in general. I'd like to see the round
    capital Epsilon in an all-caps context, but I think it will work well.\r\n\r\nI
    think the open phi should be the default. As for the open theta, I wonder how
    a tiny lead-in stroke (like for upsilon) would work. Or just make the opening
    a tiny bit wider. Right now it's a bit too close to a flipped beta for comfort.\r\n\r\nI
    am not sure about the lead-in stroke for the lowercase omega. I am too used to
    seeing it curled inwards.\r\n\r\nI am not someone who thinks chi should <em>always</em>
    descend, but in this design, I think the descending chi is better. A non-descending
    chi can be confused with a script kappa.\r\n\r\nI like the angle of the tonos
    just fine right now.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: Better, but the entry stroke could be lowered so there is a little gap and
    the overall shape is clearer. The entry stroke doesn't have to be as high as in
    the other letters. Right now, this might not work very well in small sizes because
    of the black spot that is created.

  body: "As I can attest from a visit several years ago, the Korean diaspora in Southern
    Ukraine is also very heavily Russified. They were cut off completely from their
    homeland for many decades. All except the very elderly have forgotten Korean.
    They are incomparably more assimilated than Korean-Americans, Korean-Chinese,
    or Korean-Japanese. I would say Soviet restrictions on movement and minority cultural
    expression did play a role here.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't really until after the Soviet
    breakup that Koreans and other ethnic minorities could become active in promoting
    and celebrating their own culture.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it's interesting how some
    places in Southern Ukraine and Crimea have retained ancient Greek names."
