body: Is there no way to specify that the "writing system" for OT fonts is the [[International
  Phonetic Alphabet]]. Or have I overlooked something? I'm wondering how I would implement
  an alternate form of beta for IPA than is used for Greek. I thought having an IPA
  [[script tag]] would be the easiest way to do this, but none seems to exist. Should
  there be one? I think that this makes at least as much sense as having script tags
  for braille and byzantine music. Since there's not currently a script tag for this,
  is having a stylistic set just for IPA alternates the next best thing? Thanks for
  looking.

    blocks. Generally, the OTL script tags conform to Unicode blocks or groups of
    blocks.\r\n\r\nIPA is an extension of the Latin script, drawing characters from
    a variety of different Unicode blocks. I think a good argument could be made for
    registering an IPA language system tag. But in the meantime, I think all you need
    to do for your variant beta is to make it the default localised form under the
    'latn' script tag."
