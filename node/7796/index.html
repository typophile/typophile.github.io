  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In a recent search to find something better than Courier New for programming, I came upon this thread&hellip; <BR> <BR><a href="http://typographi.com/000744.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://typographi.com/000744.php">http://typographi.com/000744.php</a></a> <BR> <BR>I tried some 40 odd fonts and found that I like Bitstream Vera Mono at 9pt very much. However, I would like to modify the font in a few ways, just slightly. I found very little free or cheap tools to do so. I found one called Softy&hellip; <BR> <BR><a href="http://users.breathe.com/l-emmett/" target="_blank"><a href="http://users.breathe.com/l-emmett/">http://users.breathe.com/l-emmett/</a></a> <BR> <BR>Using Softy I turned Vera Mono 9pt into a bitmap font so I could easily edit it. This is great! However, I noticed that on my (Windows) box TT fonts are nicely anti-aliased while bitmap fonts are not. Softy only does B&amp;W. I tried the FONmaker demo and the bitmap fonts it created were not anti-aliased either. <BR> <BR>Is it possible to rasterize TT fonts into anti-aliased bitmaps fonts? What program would allow me to do this conversion? What can I use to easily modify the bitmap font? <BR> <BR>I'm only really planning to modify this one font for my programming, since I stare at it some 10 hours a day. I have little artist skill and highly doubt I will be doing anything else with fonts. Because of this, I don't really want to spend $100+ for a program that does what I need plus much more. I think $30-$40 is reasonable for what I want. I would pay someone if they could help! However, I would like to be able to edit the grayscale font myself, so I don't have to keep bugging someone for any small changes I may want down the road.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not following you, I swear! I sort of live here&hellip;  :-&gt; <BR> <BR>Delivering hand-made grayscale fonts is a tricky business - I know because I tried for over six years! Then Ultrafonts came on the scene and made it possible - I'll explain below. But first the reasons why it's so tricky: the FON format doesn't support grayscale (it also doesn't support extended encodings BTW), and while the TT format is supposed to allow embedded grayscale bitmaps (for which you can use BitFonter - not a cheap program though) I could never get it to actually work. And then there's the Mac side, which no longer supports any bitmap formats of any kind&hellip; <BR> <BR>So in the end the only robust way of delivering hand-made grayscale fonts is to make pixelfonts: outline fonts that have funny blocky patterns that render out the desired grays at the right pixel locations when used at a certain size. And making these fonts is no picnic; you can try to do it yourself, but I'd advise against it. Much better would be to sign up as a developer at Ultrafonts.com, which is what I did. They have a converter that takes a filled Photoshop template and spits out a grayscale TT pixelfont, but as a result you have to share any sales profits with them. You might not be interested in more than just using the end result yourself, but know that they would expect a finished font that can be sold retail. Alternatively you might talk them into a no-strings-attached per-conversion fee; but I doubt it will be $40&hellip; <BR> <BR>If you're not dead-set on doing your own design, here's another idea: as you know I'm considering making a monospaced version of Mana. If you can wait let's say a couple of months, and you're willing to pay me the $40 to speed up the development, I'll make you a Manamono-13 Bold, and you can start coding in high style. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I am guessing my LCD monitors are fixed at 96dpi? <BR> <BR>Yes, LCDs have fixed resolutions (which is why they look like crap if you force a non-native resolution on them). But some simple pythagorean math seems to yield a dpi of about 86 for your display. Windows however does default to 96dpi, but that's just a nominal/internal thing, not an actual measure. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ack, at first I thought it might be an Adobe thing too, but then I checked to see in other apps and *mistakenly* thought it was correct there. That's what I get for looking up ITC Kabel, which was accidentaly at the right place, from I and K being so close. Duh. More attention, maybe&hellip;</div>
