  body: The avatar replacement is weird. Last time I tried, it did not appear to work,
    so I constantly removed and uploaded, etc. Then all of a sudden, it was there,
    like days later. Is it something to do with caches on the server or sorting?

  body: We started having problems like this when we upgraded our server a few weeks
    ago. Everything had to re-cache, and somewhere in the process this avatar thing
    a happened.
