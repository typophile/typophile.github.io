    they\u2019re employed in the company identity that makes them (and their company)
    unique.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, there are dozens, even hundreds of logo designers
    who go beyond stock, go beyond fonts, and do something that *is* unique. Whether
    it's lettering or some other non-font solution.*\r\n\r\nbut the landscape is dominated
    by the THOUSANDS of logo designers who design nice stuff using stock art and readily
    available fonts and do work that fits into your description...rarely unique. Some
    of it's great, some of it is pedestrian, some is pure trash.\r\n\r\nso unique
    logos are not common, but not rare unto themselves, either. To suggest that the
    way to make it unique is mostly in the way we employ it in the identity -- I can't
    buy that. Quite a lot of us make letters here. Maybe that might be an approach?
    (And apologies penn and ink if I've inferred incorrectly; i enjoy your work and
    I'm simply taking your comment as a starting point.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow, I'm
    not a designer by trade or by schooling, so when stumbled upon Typophile in 2001,
    I made logos the way the logo was made in this thread -- I set a word in a font
    I liked. If I was lucky, Kinko's would have some good fonts installed. ;)\r\n\r\nI'd
    pick 5-10 fonts, set a word, and then see which one looked best.\r\n\r\nNow I
    understand budgets, time, etc. and the fact that in 2009, fonts alone can make
    a logo designer look brilliant. (all the alternate characters and OT functionality
    = myriad choices).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2002, I happened up on <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/1332\">this thread</a> and we were all given
    a typographic ass kicking by Jay Wilkinson. I don't even have to re-read the thread
    to remember his name -- it's burnished on my brain.\r\n\r\nI was naive about design
    and letterstuff, and Jay was pompous and arrogant, but he said some things that
    got me thinking. \r\n\r\nHis mention of Art Center also prodded me to make the
    drive to Pasadena and the Art Center bookstore, where I eventually picked up two
    Doyald Young books. As I've told Doyald several times, his books changed my perspective
    overnight. It was like the sky opened up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there are reasons laid
    out in Doyald's books why using an existing font is a poor idea for a logotype
    -- the most obvious one being the fact that everyone has access to that same font,
    including competitors.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to agree with this. You don't have
    to agree with the rants of Jay Wilkinson. But if you are setting the company name
    in a bunch of different fonts, it would behoove you to *at least* look at this
    other perspective. It can only improve your work and give you more options when
    working with clients.\r\n\r\nIt's not difficult to draw letters or create them
    in illustrator with a little guidance and experience.\r\n\r\nSo another path exists.
    and maybe a wake-up call.\r\n\r\nwww.delphipress.com\r\n\r\nis doyald's website\r\n\r\nanyone
    know what became of Jay Dub?\r\n\r\n\r\n* just talking about logotypes; when you
    add an icon or graphic device, the ability to do something unique unto itself
    grows considerably."

    you sift through the internet egoism) and the referral to Doyald's books. They
    look like valuable reads.\r\n\r\n<cite>Well, there are dozens, even hundreds of
    logo designers who go beyond stock, go beyond fonts, and do something that *is*
    unique. Whether it\u2019s lettering or some other non-font solution.*</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    agree with your sentiment about going beyond stock wholeheartedly. Still, doing
    custom letter work alone, while it will make the mark special and unique to the
    company, will not necessarily guarantee a unique market presence. What I wanted
    to call attention to, in my too brief response, is that a lot of times designers
    (or more often clients) want too much immediate identification for their company
    to come from the mark alone, while they ignore the role that aspects such as mark
    implementation, quality of printed materials, signage, etc. play in determining
    the quality of their identity. In short\u2014a great mark is made by much more
    than the mark itself.\r\n\r\n<cite>To suggest that the way to make it unique is
    mostly in the way we employ it in the identity \u2014 I can\u2019t buy that.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou're
    right. I don't mean to say that a mark's uniqueness comes <em>mostly</em> from
    its implementation. You can't make a bad mark great just by choosing the right
    color and the right paper (or what have you). But obviously both need to work
    hand in hand with each other. Many just forget the second part's role in setting
    the tone of the organization (and by extension, its uniqueness in their mind).\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, I think we sit on the same side of the issue. But thank you for the wake-up
    call. The importance of the hand-made can never be stressed enough.\r\n\r\n\r\npenn\r\n\r\np.s.

    Departing from Doyald's philosophy, I do see times when a mark should be fairly
    invisible. Especially if it's coupled with a strong graphic element.\r\n\r\nthere's
    a big picture that designer's need to examine, and I think that we are both on
    the same page there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
