  body: My guess would be the are refering to &#43;10 tracking. For example &#43;10
    in indesign, sometimes refered to as &#43;10%, which is I belive 10% of an EM.

  body: 'Be careful about tracking: different apps use different units for tracking.
    Notoriously, Quark tracking is in some terribly coarse units like 1/200 of an
    em, while Adobe&#39;s is more like 1/1000 of an em. <BR> <BR>Specifying % of em
    is quite a good idea, if this is what your British standard intends, but only
    so long as you know what units your application is using. 10% of the em is going
    to be a different value in Quark than it is in Adobe apps, but if you know the
    unit used you can calculate the value from the x% em specification. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    just my guess though. Can you contact the authors of the document for clarification?'

  body: Tanya -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a Brit. But I am in agreement with the others.
    The &#34;em&#34; here goes with the 10%, not with the &#34;kerning&#34;. The instructions
    are asking for kerning in the amount of 10% em. An em is, of course, a relative
    value equal to the point size of the type in question. <BR> <BR>As John points
    out, different applications use different size units for measuring kerning/tracking.
    In Quark, the smallest unit is indeed 1/200th of an em. In InDesign, it is 1/1000th
    of an em. So in Quark, 10% em would be 20 units; whereas in InDesign, it would
    be 100 units. <BR> <BR>These days the terms &#34;kerning&#34; and &#34;tracking&#34;
    are often used interchangeably. I&#39;ve always considered them separate, though
    similar, adjustments. Kerning is fit adjustment between specific individual pairs.
    Tracking is set-width adjustment over a range of glyphs -- global kerning, if
    you will.  <BR> <BR>It may just be me, but I&#39;ve always considered the default
    direction of kerning/tracking to be negative, so in the absence of a specification
    like &#34;positive&#34; kerning, my interpretation is to close up the space. <BR>

    </i> <BR> <BR>Not 20pts, 20 tracking units, but yes you get the idea. <BR> <BR>I
    think Illustrator uses the same tracking units as other Adobe apps, i.e. 1/1000
    of the em. <BR> <BR>If you are spacing manually, rather than using application
    tracking, then you&#39;ll probably want to think in terms of points. So 10% em
    kerning for 14pt text is going to be 14&#42;0.1 = 1.4pts

  body: Nathan&#39;s got it. It&#39;s all relative. <BR> <BR>When you type in 20 for
    tracking in Quark, you&#39;re indicating 20/200ths of an em &#40;which is the
    same thing as 10% -- 20 divided by 200, right?&#41;. The actual physical value
    of this will change depending upon the point size of the type that has been tracked.
    If the type is 14 point, then the net effect will be to track it open by 1.4 pts.
    But if you change the type size to 24 points, the physical value of your 10% tracking
    will change to 2.4 points. But it&#39;s still 10% of an em. <BR> <BR>BTW, this
    is all regardless of what units you have your application set to work in -- points,
    ciceros, millimeters. It doesn&#39;t matter. An em is a relative measure. And
    the tracking is specified in fractions of an em.  <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

    bowls were inconsistent, layed out columns of dummy copy by hand and then was
    told that the fictional &#34;art director&#34; changed his mind and wanted .5in

  body: Ah, I remember c/p charts and haberules. I was fortunate to have a younger
    brother who operated a Compugraphic at the local typesetters, and I would call
    him up and say, &#34;Could you reset that job 10 on 11 instead and bring it home
    with you?&#34; <BR> <BR>Tanya, computers mostly just make it different, not always
    easier. The computer transferred so much more control to the designer. But with
    that came a whole lot more responsibility -- which many designers didn&#39;t/don&#39;t
    recognize, and consequently a lot of subtlety and quality was lost in the transition.
    It seems now, also, that often the technology dictates the design rather than
    the other way around. <BR> <BR>That said, I&#39;m grateful for the computer. But
    I&#39;m also grateful to have learned design without one. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>
