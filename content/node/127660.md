body: "This font was installed on my company laptop (which was previously used by
  someone else). The file is named \"agnes.otf\", but I haven't been able to find
  it under that name anywhere, or find out who designed it. It only has uppercase
  glyphs, and no numerals or special characters.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if \"Agnes\"
  is its real name, who might have designed it, and whether there is a more complete
  character set to be purchased somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance."

    character set might indicate that it was a work-in-progress, a personal typeface,
    or even student work.\r\n\r\nYou've no way of contacting the previous user of
    the laptop?"

  body: "Hi K. C.\r\n\r\nThanks for getting back. I no longer work there, so I'm afraid
    I have no way of finding out who the previous user of the laptop might have been.\r\nIt
    was an advertising agency, so it could very well be a personal project by some
    agency designer. It reminds me a bit of the Chanel logo (although the C is not
    quite the same), so maybe it was an attempt to develop a typeface inspired by
    it.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help."
