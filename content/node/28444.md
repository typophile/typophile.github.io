body: "Hi everyone, I am new here.....\r\n\r\nI've discovered this great site thanks
  to a link from Google which sent me to a discussion in which the El Al logo was
  mentioned.\r\nI just LOVE the current El Al logo, which was designed by Dan Reisinger
  35 years ago, together with the magnificent turquoise livery which I will always
  bitterly miss! This livery was just incredible: its design looked very harmonious
  and elegant on each model of El Al's Boeing planes, and its colors were absolutely
  striking. El Al abandoned it, very sadly, in 1999, in a move that was meant to \"modernize\"
  the company image. But obviously, the level of service has not improved enough over
  the last years and the bad reputation of the airline survived despite the new look
  of its airplanes...\r\n\r\nAnd now, El Al has started to introduce a \"new logo\",
  in order to have a \"fresher\" image...This \"new\" logo is just HORRIBLE!!! It
  is ugly!!! \r\n\r\nAnd actually, it is not a new logo, it is only a disfigurement
  of the current one. It appears on the El Al website (www.elal.com) and many marketing
  items, although not yet on the planes.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand how a \"graphic
  designer\" has been able to butcher in such a blatant way the masterpiece of one
  of his most talented and famous peers. It is shocking. If, at least, El Al had introduced
  a totally new logo, based on a new concept...; in such a case I would of course
  miss the current logo, but at least there would be (maybe) something interesting
  or beautiful in the new creation. Here, there's neither a new creation nor a new
  concept; some stupid and arrogant self-proclaimed graphic designer has simply \"rearranged\"
  a fantastic 35-year-old logo, destroying its great harmony, its beauty, and its
  visual impact; the new version is not only unestaetical, it is also barely redeable.
  \r\n\r\nI have shown it to dozens and dozens of friends and acquaintances; each
  of these persons with no exception said that the new version is not beautiful at
  all, and many had even difficulty to understand what it was. Indeed, a logo mixing
  a company name in two different languages and alphabets into one linear symbol is
  not something that current, but Dan Reisinger had not only the idea of creating
  such a unified logo, but he managed to make it uniquely beautiful and easily readable.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be highly interested to hear your comments...and if someone has an idea of what
  could be done to try to convince El Al not to adopt this \"new\" logo, I would be
  ready to do anything...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the three logos: original, revised and current. [See the posting guideliness for
    images.] \r\n3. This is part of a series actions where big companies pay huge
    amounts of money to do miserable revisions of great logos (and yes the original
    EL AL logo was great) in attempts to be more fashionable or something--the AT&T
    logo comes to mind. \r\n\r\nIn discussions of these on other threads designers
    have said that this is a partly product of dysfunctional corporate decisions by
    committee. I still don't understand it. "

  body: "Well, I guess part of the problem is that some corporate people will do anything
    to put a permanent mark on a company, so that they can say \"I'm the one who created
    the *new* El Al\" or whatever. So the boss might want a radical change even when
    that's not advisable. \r\n\r\nAlso, remember that brand positioning is often more
    important than artistic merit (sadly). So sometimes a great logo is replaced by
    an uglier one just because the new one projects a different image. "

    is exactly what happened at El Al in 1999, and what is happening now again). But
    when a company has the priviledge of possessing a really nice and well known logo,
    it is a shame to get rid of it. I wouldn't imagine, for instance, Coca-Cola, Mercedes,
    BMW or the St.Moritz municipality \"modernizing\" their respective logos in such
    a stupid way. \r\n\r\n"

    El Al poster the other day...and it looks really UGLY and CHEAP, what a shame.
    It's crazy: each and every letter is now horrible...the \"E\", the \"L\" and the
    \"A\"; the A was so beautiful...it was designed even before the linear logo: it
    was part of the previous square logo designed by Otto Treuman in 1962 already.\r\n\r\nI
    still can't believe it."
