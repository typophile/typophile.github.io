  of America council websites (and the national site, too). \r\n\r\n[[http://www.scouting.org/]]\r\n\r\nThe
  font is Berstrom DT.\r\n\r\nThe official BSA design guidelines for websites specify
  the use of Times New Roman and Arial in almost everything. The logo headers are
  an exception.\r\n\r\nI was trippin' trying to figure out how somebody customized
  TMR to look like that."
