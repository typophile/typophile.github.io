body: Sorry for the crappy scan, I&#39;m working from a business card. The closest
  match I can find is URW&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/viking-gothic/"
  target="_blank">Viking Gothic</a>, but that font has no lowercase &#40;while this
  one appears to&#41; and Viking doesn&#39;t have the rounded corners on the E.  <BR>
  <BR>Note also the rectangular counters in the P &amp; O. <BR> <BR>Any help greatly
  appreciated... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63946.gif"

  body: Hi Tiffany, <BR> <BR>Looks pretty darn close. The only discrepancy I &#40;think
    I&#41; see is that the counter in the V of Industria is much deeper - although
    that may simply be a result of printing such small type on the business card.
    <BR> <BR>That said, the distinctive angle-cut foot of the i is pretty convincing.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the lead...
