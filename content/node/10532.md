body: Hi, <BR>I made an Arabic TTF with AAT for Mac which also includes Roman char
  range. <BR>I want to have Arabic char samples in preview of Font Book &#40;as default
  and not custom set in Font Book&#41; but it shows Roman samples. Arabic fonts bundled
  with OS X do show Arabic samples by default &#40;and Chinese and Japanese samples
  for those fonts&#41; <BR>How do you do that? <BR>I use FontLab and Apple font tools
  for OS X.

  body: I&#39;d like to know this too, Behnam. I hope to design an AAT Arabic font
    once I know more about Arabic. <BR> <BR>Maybe if no one here has an answer, asking
    on an official Apple mailing list would help. If you do get an answer, please
    post it here. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: I just learnd how to do MIF for Arabic script &#40;in a very basic way&#41;
    and I&#39;m working on it right now. This language identification of the font
    is not necessarily related to AAT but maybe to other issues more general in fonts
    or at least common in TTF fonts. I doubt that MS Arial which inludes Arabic range
    has any AAT but it still shows Arabic samples in Font Book. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    post here if the Arabic AAT font I&#39;m working on was successful.
