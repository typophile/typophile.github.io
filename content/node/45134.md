body: "I have a library of .ik files created from a design program called Signus.
  \ The library was from my days in the sign business.  The program was dos based
  and I do not have the pc with the program on it, but I do have all the files.\r\n\r\nI
  want to be able to view these files and print them from my windows xp machine.  I
  do not want to purchase a program, as I do not want to modify the files. I just
  want to view and print.  Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nStudioz"

  body: If you are on a PC, you might first try <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/">DTL
    FontMaster Light</a> (I have never used that program, and according to the doc,
    the free version cannot handle more than 256 glyphs per database).
