  \r\nAny thoughts?"

    like condensed for headings, either, but if it must be condensed, how about trying
    something like Franklin Gothic Bold Condensed and bringing it down to 14 pt? '

  body: "The body faces you have chosen are very middling, in terms of weight, proportion,
    and style (although the Eurostile does have a bit of personality).\r\nTherefore,
    they are not sufficiently extreme to counterpoint the heading, which is highly
    condensed, finely detailed, high contrast, and mannered.\r\nOverall, the effect
    is one-sided, not balanced.\r\nI recommend Beaufort Extended (my own faces always
    come to mind, for some reason :-)\r\nIt holds its own against the extremism of
    Anaconda, by being extended in proportion (contrary), finely detailed in serif
    finish (similar), low contrast (contrary), and somewhat mannered (similar). \r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/extended/\r\n\r\nI
    also think one has to have a reason for using a condensed face. Often the layout
    calls for it.\r\nIf that is not the case, then a pairing with an extended face
    seems reasonable."

  body: "Thank you both. Yes, there is a reason for using a condensed font. The layout
    and the fonts need to feel...well, quaint. And I like the rigor and structure
    that Anaconda has, as to me it seems to suggest exactly that: old style without
    being antiquated, strong, encased in a well fitting suit. I don't think a sans
    font would cut it for headlines in this case - or at least I haven't seen yet
    a sans serif that is as rigorous and structured and befits that atmosphere that
    I'm trying to create.\r\nNick Shinn, that's a wonderful font.I did some tests
    with the generated samples from myfonts and I think the regular width would look
    better though. The extended feels a bit overwhelming for some reason - though
    perhaps that's because the paragraphs won't be very wide, 500 px maximum(yes,
    this is for the web). But I might be wrong since my background is in front-end
    dev and not in typography.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5240.jpg]\r\nAny
    thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and patience."

  body: "This is for web?\r\n\r\nBe sure to check Beaufort's rendering in Windows
    both with Standard (Greyscale) rendering and Cleartype rendering.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think Franklin Gothic is that bad here, so I'll suggest a couple of others in
    the same vein: \r\nFF Bau from FontFont shares the static skeleton (structure)
    with Anaconda, and is available for @font-face embedding in a properly hinted
    Web version. The same goes for Benton Sans from Font Bureau."

  body: "Thank you. FF Bau is a bit too strong, in my opinion. I want the text to
    be readable, but I still want the headers to catch one's attention. I am afraid
    that with too many strong elements the user won't be able to focus on anything.
    However you gave me the idea(well, indirectly) to search for a pair at the same
    font house and I found Flanders. I keep looking at it and I think I might have
    a winner here, though I wish it was just a tad more extended.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_6000.jpg]\r\nPerhaps
    someone knows of a similar font in an extended version?"
