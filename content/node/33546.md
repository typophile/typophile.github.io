body: "I'm looking for a typeface for my school newspaper to complement Farnham, which
  we use for headlines, and Mercury, used for body text. I redesigned the newspaper
  over the summer and have been using Myriad Pro for sidebars and captions and Chaparral
  Pro for \"nuts and bolts\" (all the text not tied to any particular story). Both
  faces have served me well, but now that the redesign has had some time to breathe,
  I want to get something that <em>really</em> works with the design.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm looking for: I want a typeface that can be used for everything other than headlines
  and body text: pullout quotes, the masthead, captions, jumplines, etc. Because we
  have a very tiny staff that, while willing to learn, does not have much in the way
  of training in graphic design, I'd like the typeface to be extremely typographically
  interesting; it should not recede, but rather pop, to make up for potentially uninteresting
  layouts. I chose Farnham for this reason; it's strong angularity and serifs are
  extremely forceful and compelling. Mildly contradictorily, the fonts should be clean
  -- nothing <em>incredibly</em> distracting to the reader. Finally and obviously,
  the typeface needs to work well with Farnham and Mercury, as well as within the
  confines of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I came up with three very strong
  contenders: <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude>Amplitude</a>, <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/shaker.htm>Shaker</a>,
  and <a href=http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-23-john-sans>John
  Sans</a>. Amplitude has the requisite character, and <a href=http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22547.html>Christian
  Schwartz himself says</a> that it works well with Farnham. Shaker shares Amplitude's
  and Farnham's angularity, but is a bit subtler (although not too much so). John
  Sans is a softer typeface, which adds a nice touch of contrast, is based on a transitional
  model like Farnham is, and has letterforms that are funky enough for me.\r\n\r\nSo,
  first, does anyone know which of those three I listed will work especially well/fail
  miserably? And second, are there any that I should definitely consider as well?
  Thanks a ton for any assistance.\r\n\r\nBelow is a page from our last issue for
  a bit of context:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/April Front Final Small_6580.jpg]"

  body: 'I''d look for something with a little 19th Century sturdiness and character:
    FF Hydra, FF Bau, Maple (Process Type Foundry), Champion (H&FJ), and the new Parry
    Grotesque (OurType) would all play well with your serifs.'

  body: "Thanks for the ideas, Marc. I had glossed over the whole 19th century grotesque
    revival genre, thinking that it wouldn't send a message of freshness and modernity,
    but on further reflection the typefaces you mentioned could be strong possibilities.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I forgot to mention as a criterion is that the type needs to be immediately
    recognizable as new and different not just to the typographically aware but to
    a typical reader: again, I want the type to stand out to generate some design
    \"points\" when the layout in general might not. With this in mind, I think that
    FF Bau and FF Hydra are too subtle for my purposes (although I was planning on
    buying FF Bau for use in other projects). And I have to rule out Champion because
    of the lack of italics, which we use frequently.\r\n\r\nBut Maple and Parry Grotesque
    could both work well (although the more conservative members of the staff might
    find them too extravagant). I'll have to print out the PDFs and get a feel for
    them. Any other suggestions on typefaces or comments on the ones already listed?"

  body: Thanks for reminding me of Parisine, Steve; I've long admired it, but didn't
    think of it for this project. Parisine may be a bit tame for my vision of the
    design, but Parisine Plus is alluring. Even with the simplified alternate letterforms
    in one of the stylistic sets, however, it might be too distracting for body text.
    I'm also concerned about Parisine's origin as signage type, as I'm not sure whether
    it will work in editorial use. Probably would, though.

    is it? Everything other than body text or body text?\r\n\r\nTo each his own, but
    I find Maple distracting and annoying (the wedge stroke ends (b, d, p, q, n, etc.;
    the number 5). I also have questions about Maple's readability, especially in
    the heavier weights. I was being kind when I said \"idiosyncratic\". But my annoyance
    may be someone else's delight."

  body: "You're right; when I said body text recently, I meant longer passages in
    sidebars. Since sidebars generally don't have too much text, a distinctive typeface
    could be fine, but Parisine Plus might be just <em>too</em> distinctive.\r\n\r\nAnd
    after looking at Maple and Parry Grotesque more, I'm not sure if they're ideal.
    They have an intentional feeling of awkwardness, which I like, but I don't think
    it works with the refined yet powerful feeling of Farnham. I'll offer them up
    to the other staffers nevertheless."

    ink traps add increasing interest/character as the face scales up.

  body: "Marc, I didn't see those ink traps until you pointed them out to me; lucky
    that MyFonts lets me view up to 72 pts! While they do add some more flair, I'm
    concerned that most student readers won't find it as distinctive as I'd like them
    to. I want to be sure that even the least typographically knowledgeable person
    will know, \"This isn't just Helvetica.\" While that may not happen, that's what
    I'm aiming for. Also, I get a techno/machined-grunge feel from the letterforms,
    which isn't what I want. \r\n\r\nI am still quite interested in people's opinions
    on the three I listed earlier: Amplitude, Shaker, and John Sans. Most people I've
    asked seem to prefer Amplitude or Shaker, but I'm wondering if anyone has had
    any experience with the three or could give me some guidance. The difficulty is
    that I'm infatuated with all of them, so I'm having trouble choosing just one.
    It's what they call a good problem."

  body: Reed, if you are using the sans inline with Farnham I might suggest something
    with a little more style contrast. Neutraface works well, I think, with Farnham.
    It isn't a perfect historical match, but they complement one another.

  body: "Thanks for the quick response, Tiff, but I'm not mixing the two within one
    line. Farnham (Medium, both roman and italic) is used only for headlines, with
    Mercury for body text. The sans I get will be used for captions, pull quotes,
    folios, the masthead, credit lines, etc. (although bylines and subheads might
    be in it as well, so maybe there will be a closer relationship).\r\n\r\nI had
    investigated Neutraface, along with Verlag, Terminal Design's Tangent, Font Bureau's
    Relay, and Jim Parkinson's Richmond, after seeing a newspaper or two combine Farnham
    and Mercury with a geometric sans. My concern was that the exactness of the genre
    might clash with the strong yet refined brashness of Farnham. Also, I wasn't sure
    if these sans-serifs might give too strong an Art Deco feel (whenever I look at
    People Magazine, for example, I always get that sense). Farnham also has a historical
    sense to it, but I have found it to be more subtle, especially when used in a
    modern newspaper setting. Nevertheless, I'll take another look at these, so thanks
    for the impetus.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about Amplitude and Shaker, however, I did
    have the concern that you mentioned of whether they might be too similar to Farnham.
    This was why I was thinking about the softer John Sans and Steve's great suggestion
    of Parisine Plus, but the few editors to whom I have shown type samples so far
    have preferred Amplitude and Shaker."

  body: 'As usual, I spent too long debating every little merit of each typeface and
    ended up coming right back to where I started: I finally bought Shaker as the
    secondary sans for the newspaper. (EDIT: The same thing happened when buying Farnham
    and Mercury in the first place: they were among my first choices, but I vacillated
    for over a month. In the future, I''ll try to have more faith in my instincts.)
    Tiffany''s suggestion got me thinking that Amplitude was too similar to Farnham
    and would feel monotonous, and John Sans and Parisine Plus didn''t appeal to the
    other staffers (not newsy enough). So it came down to Neutraface and Shaker. After
    comparing them, I felt that the geometric Art Deco feel of Neutraface wasn''t
    quite right for the publication, so Shaker it is. So far, I''ve gotten a good
    response from my colleagues, and I''m really looking forward to implementing it
    in the next issue. Thanks again to everyone who chimed in; I really appreciate
    your suggestions and concerns.'
