- body: "I like the logo very much. I like the colors very much. But...\r\n\r\nThere's
    too much going on that distracts from these great elements. The rounded corners
    of the logo's frame square don't match the style of the logo, and frankly, it's
    altogether unnecessary. If it were me, I'd scrap the square altogether or use
    it to encompass both logo and logotype (perhaps knocking out the logotype in white
    or a lighter color?)\r\n\r\nThe yellow knobs on the barbell need a smidgen more
    air to match the logo's other spaces.\r\n\r\nThe multicolor logotype isn't working
    for me. I'd use the darkest gray (only) from the logo square for the logotype.
    The scale is off, too - why is it so small compared to the logo? If you're going
    to have the barbell crushing the logotype, it needs to be look more intentional.
    :)\r\n\r\nHave you searched for a font with more character? Perhaps something
    with more width (something burly like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/dienstag/black/|Dienstag]]
    or even [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/thinkdust/taku/|Taku]]) may compliment
    the logo better. Right now, the logotype looks wimpy and disconnected -  like
    an afterthought.\r\n\r\nNow that I've torn it apart, let me add that I think it's
    pretty cool and headed in the right direction. The colors are especially pleasing,
    and work well to attract men and women to a fitness store, which I think can be
    quite hard. Well done. "

    comment and James's comment refer to a logo that's been deleted -- and we can't
    edit our comments. Anyone who reads this thread will be confused. \r\n\r\nThe
    whole idea of this forum is to critique the progression of a logo, and you won't
    get any feedback if people can't figure out what's going on.\r\n\r\nYour new version
    needs some air. The logo is too close to the logotype, and the scale doesn't feel
    right. The two elements are competing with each other rather than working as a
    unit.\r\n"

    helpful comments on what has been posted.\r\n\r\n1. The newest version is now
    too spread out; The size of the letters is better but I would keep the kerning
    you had previously and move the type closer to the logo.\r\n\r\n2. The white between
    the handle and the darker weights is smaller than the other spaces. My eye also
    goes to the rounded corners on the crossbar as they are the only thing not geometric
    about this logo and type.\r\n\r\n3. There are too many gray's for my taste. Keep
    this version but make another that uses the darkest gray for the type and the
    weights (crossbar can stay orange).\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Good luck."

    ? The concept behind the mark is a solid, but in its current form it looks too
    much like a weight and too little like an H. If the H were more obvious and the
    mark were a bit simpler, it'd look much better.\r\n\r\nAlso, agreed with Nachos
    regarding letter spacing. I think spacing in [[http://typophile.com/files/heroes_3973.jpg|this

  body: The 1:50 postings are a step backwards. The weights seem more like headphones
    in this round. Interesting idea and it's good to test all your ideas, but the
    earlier posting had stronger designs. I'd like to see the type come down in size
    a few points to add more contrast the mark and give the overall design more interest.

    with the form are being confused by the use of color and grayscale. Nail it down
    in black and white, then add color back where you want it. It helps tremendously.\r\n\r\nAs
    much as I love Avenir, the cap R is feeling a bit awkward. To make this work more
    as a logotype, I think you need to adjust it, lowering the crossbar of the R a
    little. I find it distracting."
