body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking for designers to submit some new,
  original and exciting typefaces for Colophon's autumn release schedule.\r\n\r\nWe
  accept submissions through e-mail at the following address:\r\n\r\nabc@colophon-foundry.org\r\n\r\nYou
  may submit as many as you like, and in any form of completion (ideally, this would
  be at least all major characters completed). Not technically minded? If we feel
  that your typeface has true potential, we can take the project on further so it
  can be released.\r\n\r\nPlease keep e-mail submissions below 3mb, and in PDF/Jpg
  form is best.\r\n\r\nWarmest,\r\n\r\nColophon Foundry"

    a random assortment? I'll send through a pdf anyways so you can see my latest
    work. :)\r\n"

  body: Hi Ricardo, yes I know them as I live in Brighton too and have met the guys
    there. I thought normally smaller foundries have fonts of a particular feel?
