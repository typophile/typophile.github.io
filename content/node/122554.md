  what font is this? I can't find a perfect match, the closest I found was Nexa Light,
  but some letters are different."

    approximate matches to the letterforms.\r\nNote all letters seem to be the same
    width, e.g. width of _P_ and _m_ equals the width for _e_ etc. So you are looking
    for a narrow monospace sans font with a two story _g_ that has an open bottom.\r\nDon"

      the specs you told.\r\nI was afraid that it were an internal font unfortunately
      I can't contact the brand, their contact form doesn't work."
