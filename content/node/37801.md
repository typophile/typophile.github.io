  not looking for uber formal, but needs to be able to set body copy.\r\n\r\nThey
  just rejected gotham rounded after 3 months of use, so need something unique...
  any suggestions?"

  body: thanks fellas, much appreciated, I really like Alfon and Freight, although
    I think Cicero probably has the more unique features... meaning obvious enough
    the client "may" notice them!

  body: "Hi Jelma,\r\n\r\nthanks for your link of Arnhem etc. Very nice site I think.\r\nImpressing,
    almost discouraging ;-) if you know what I mean.\r\nI would stick with Arnhem.
    For me its a good example for a good working and charming textface with modern
    feeling. Its always the netherlands which (in my eyes naturally) produce those
    kinds of smooth (not slick) faces which strikes the eye in a positive sense when
    seen in a book. Just as Lexicon No2 for example and others.\r\nArnhem is great.
    \r\nGood link.\r\n\r\nStefan"

    think when I said modern, what I really meant was a serif typeface that the client
    will not look at and immediately think: old fashioned serif.\r\n\r\nGreat links,
    I like Alfon, although I am due to it's seemingly more delicate nature, I am worried
    they will not. "

    set a bit of a sample for you and send you a pdf.\r\n\r\nJames "
