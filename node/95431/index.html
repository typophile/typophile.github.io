<blockquote>make sure folks Googling for a font will find authorized retailers before they find free downloadable versions.</blockquote>

This would happen somewhat over the long run the more download sites cooperate, but here's an idea that might help it along: instead of relying solely on the font houses' own site(s) maybe TypeSnitch could -with each font house's consent- have a (Google-searchable) page that directs people searching for a font (that is subscribed to TypeSnitch) to where to buy it. With enough visits and links (and hopefully whatever else is in Google magic potion) that page might become a high-ranked portal (sorry for the 90s terminology :-) for where to buy a font.

		<div class="commentbody">@ Herb - Indeed saw this article a few days ago and my sense is that it would definitely improve the service since it would make it possible to simultaneously submit a takedown e-mail and send Google a copyright violation notice, especially in cases when the site owner is non-compliant. The service is still very much needed since the work to locate all infringing instances is better automated than manual.

@ Dave - Absolutely! The idea is to generate populated e-mails that foundries can send from the site and move towards fully automated e-mails quickly. The dream is to make this a fully automated service rather spend time manually ticking through work that can be automated. Right now, it's a one time buy-in fee specific to the fonts you're looking to find and remove.

@ Bendy - When the font is renamed or 'cribbed', one need only add a new font name to the service and start looking for that one as well.

Also, we're at 78% now, nearly there but we still have a bit to go, please encourage any others you know who would benefit from this service but haven't donated yet to do so.</div>

@ Frank - 99%!?!?!? Very Exciting! Be assured I couldn't support or promote any effort that I didn't feel would be a successful solution for this problem and aid the folks who helped to fund it. I suspect once it's fully funded you'll start to receive a welcome letter from the developer with status updates.

As defined, the project required full funding before any work could be started, so it'll be in the build stage next and soon!</div>

Stuart, how might Content ID be relevant here?

You know as well as I we're just too far from being able to track fonts in any meaningful way so the Content ID thing is a great idea but without a single platform for distributing ALL fonts the way YouTube holds all their content, doesn't really have much purchase.</div>

Well, they're not EXACTLY the same; TypeSnitch is a derivative of Identifont, only subscription-based, so Stu makes money. Likewise, Stu's BTN line is derivative of a lot of other popular fonts, and Stu makes money. However, Stu is very possessive of typeface for which he has paid to "owns" the designs. Capisce?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Gang,

Sorry you're all off-base . . . Firstly, I have no dreams on making another Identifont, not even close . . .

TypeSnitch is simply a tool for font foundry owners to find 'freely' distributed versions of their commercial for sale only fonts floating all over the internet that shouldn't be there and automates the task of getting them removed via automated or manually executed take-down letters, DCMAs, etc and building relationships with site owners who didn't know the fonts were there to get them removed and generally doing what the service can to assure the top search results for a font name yield ACTUAL retailers of the fonts first and not free downloads of the fonts.

TypeSnitch is a tool and nothing more and one that I think myself and a lot of font designers really need to preserve the value of their libraries. I'd much prefer to make fonts and negotiate licenses than troll the internet and send take-down letters all day and figured there must be a way it could be automated if such a tool was built for this task, so I got in touch with a developer who agreed the idea made sense and if it could be funded would be built .

I'm pleased with how quickly it received funding which means lots of folks support the idea and as the funding increases, it gives the developer more capital to make the service better. To be absolutely clear about this, while I'm a primary driver of the effort, I haven't and won't ever receive a dime of the funds donated, they 100% go to the developer and PayPal who takes their cut to accept the funds.

I suspect over time, the cash I donated to fund the effort will be easily returned in legitimate font sales of my works and it gives me peace of mind that I'm doing something to assure the sites that shouldn't have 'em don't. The fact that I opened up the project so other font designers could participate was because I knew it was a tool others needed, just as I do and to be more than fully funded in under 3 weeks proves that.

Lastly, I must point out the ONLY comparison to Identifont was made as a suggestion by Hrant just above in this thread about what the service COULD be and I'm honestly puzzled how quickly the wheels fell off the train with Stephen and Nick's posts since nothing I'd ever posted suggested TypeSnitch would be an Identifont type service.

And Nick, I'm not sure what you're getting at but you are welcomed to e-mail me offline at (diner at fontdiner dot com) if you have some dirty laundry you feel the need to air and FWIW, I think you have a wonderful library and respect your work but honestly have been deeply perplexed by your need to give it away freely and presume it will retain any value, perhaps I'm mis-understanding your intentions.

Calm heads everyone please, I do feel like I just broke up a lynch mob . . . Please ask questions rather jumping to conclusions so the wrong information isn't being communicated carelessly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Folks have become really jumpy, haven't they. Reminds me of people stuck in a bomb shelter for too long. Must be the economy. You can blame anything on the economy. One day I'm going to call my wife and say: "Honey, I'm not coming home tonight. You know, the economy." Being an election year doesn't help either - people feel pressured to vote the right way. As if.

Stuart, we've known each other since the first TypeCon in '98, we've had some top-tier Mendoza Malbec together, so I'm sure you know that I for one wish you only the best. And if I can somehow hitch a nice ride on this thing, awesome.
