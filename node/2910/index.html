<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey everyone. I don't like to hijack the Gen. Disc, board with personal topics, but I'm not sure how else (or where else) to get this advice on sorting out this Typophile problem I've got. <br> <br>I did the membership thing (sign-up, PayPal, etc.) for an Uppercase membership, and it all went through (from what I can tell on my receipt). I did this on January 8th. <br> <br>It's now over 20 days and an email to both Joe and Jared (as recommended by Troubleman) later, and I still don't have access to the Uppercase area, or any response from Joe or Jared. <br> <br>Has anyone else had this experience? Am I too impatient? Is there something special I should do to make this work? I've signed in and out multiple times, to no avail. I'm still a typophile without UC access. I don't mind waiting, but the page says 4-5 business days for the account upgrade/ activation, and I'm not getting any response as to why it hasn't happened yet. <br> <br>Any help would be greatly appreciated! I really like and enjoy Typophile, but I feel jilted. <br> <br>(Thanks for tolerating my public plea.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>hmmm. interesting. I'm not sure why there's a need to antagonize people who pay $40 for membership by demeaning them with "we're not Target expecting ....." but it does say Access is given in 4 - 5 business days. I've also contributed $40 and have not received a single response from three emails. The money from Paypal was snapped up like a clerk at the counter without an eyeblink. What are the procedures for a Return. I think I'd like my money back. What seemed a warm hearted contribution has turned to ice. I'm inclined to agree with Eric Pitcock. Please refund my $40 to Paypal.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I hate the Simpsons. I also hated Forest Dump. They glorify idiocy. <br>Beavis and Butthead were different though.

<div class=commentbody>Hey, let's have no <i>Simpsons</i> hating here. Or any hating, for that matter. <br> <br>I'm willing to be extra-patient because I like Typophile so much and I can still use it on some level, and also because I don't know Joe or Jared at all. For all I know, one of them is trapped in the Himalayas after a plane crash, and the other is hiking up to get them and that's why they haven't gotten to it yet. <br> <br>But I'll suggest here that they give themselves a longer window for activation and upgrading if they have difficulty delivering on their promise. It's just considerate. It'll also help ensure further user donations, since this <i>is</i> a user-supported site.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I know when I paid up it took time o get my uppercase membership, but as typophile isn't kmart, I understand that independent websites like typophile are so good that they need to be given a chance to catch up with orders. <br> <br>Typophile has been so good for my type design... <br> <br>Thank you!!! <br> <br>JIM <br>---</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just be happy they're not pulling a Serif_Magazine/Don_Hosek* on you: telling you the money will be credited to your card on the next billing cycle, then disappearing from the scene, without refunding jack... <br> <br>* A founder of the TypeRight ethics organization... Sheesh. The first (and only) time I saw him in person I smelled something funny: it was an TypeCon98, and he was wearing... a three-piece pin-striped suit. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant's responses are well-intentioned, but please know that he doesn't work here. =) <br> <br>For that matter, nobody gets paid to work here. Users' contributions and advertisers keeps this place alive. <br> <br>That said, this month we've been very heavily focused on taking Punchcut from a part-time effort to our full-time studio. We regret relying too heavily on the good will of users who've contributed financially and just want what they paid for. <br> <br>If you fit that category, and your account doesn't get upgraded to Uppercase by the end of today, please email me.</div>
