  engraved bars here...above the word Telephone? (Not the flourishes). I am in desperate
  search of these. I don't think they're adobe wood type. \r\n\r\nThe website they're
  taken from is: http://www.alembicbar.com \r\n\r\n(Design by NothingSomething)  I
  have tried asking Devin in the past what they were, but he wasn't able to get back
  to me. \r\n\r\nThanks a million!!\r\n\r\nCarey"

  body: I don't think that is from Adobe's Wood Type Ornaments. And I don't think
    it is from Nick's Fonts <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/woody-goodies-wbw/2/characters.html">Woody
    Goodies</a>, but the preview is too small.
