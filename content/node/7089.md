body: 'Hi all: <BR> <BR>This may seem to you a very simple question, but remember
  I am no typographer but just a book and type lover. <BR> <BR>I have two fonts I
  would like every program in Windows XP to recognize as Roman and its Italic. That
  is, when working in font A, and when I select italic, I would like font B to be
  automatically selected.  <BR> <BR>I know you font map in this way in many typesetting
  and even some wordprocessing programs, but I would like to have the two fonts paired
  for every program.  <BR> <BR>Is there a way to do this? And what &#40;sensibly priced,
  say around US$50 - for personal use only&#41; program would be able to do this?  <BR>
  <BR>Every reply will be welcome. <BR> <BR>Rodrigo de S'

  body: Well, it isn&#39;t difficult, but you need the correct software to do it,
    I think. You&#39;d need to edit each font&#39;s naming structure in its Font Header,
    and then re-generate &#40;export&#41; the entire font. That is the only work-around
    that I can think of, but I&#39;m not a font programming expert. <BR> <BR>Depending
    on the fonts involved, this might actually be &#34;illegal.&#34; I know that this
    sounds silly at first, but it is really meant to protect you, your documents &#40;if
    you sent them to press&#41;, and any one else who might later use your fonts/documents

  body: 'Dear Dan: <BR> <BR>Thank you for the reply. But let me assure you that I
    want to pair the too typefaces for printing only, and even that not commercially.  <BR>
    <BR>To let you all know, I just like to &#39;test&#39; the books I write. So before
    actually publishing them, I print them as well as I can and distribute them to
    my students &#40;they photocopy them&#41;. But this is NOT an edition: it is something
    I do for two or three years until the book is corrected, completed, and publisheable.  <BR>
    <BR>At this point I send the text to the publishing house in RTF format, and I
    have no further say in formatting issues - as often as not I get the dreaded Times
    Roman &#40;luckily not MT!&#41;. Of course I do not send fonts with it. I use
    only fonts that come with windows &#40;especially Palatino Linotype because of
    its extended character set which enables me to use Greek when I need it&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>So, I&#39;m sure I am not breaking any law as the types I use in the early
    versions of the book are for my use only. I even do not provide them as PDFs as
    people might get a way of extracting them.  <BR> <BR>Truth is, I&#39;m just an
    amateur typographer. I like to make the most beautiful &#39;books&#39; possible
    as I am passionate about book printing. But then the publishing houses very seldom
    are... It is only a private passion. Suffice it to say that they always require
    an RTF copy!  <BR> <BR>SO you may believe me: what I am asking for is purely for
    private use and &#42;never&#42; commercial.  <BR> <BR>By the way: I just purchased
    ITC Galliard cc. When I make pdfs I use the normal Galliard. I acquired it without
    such restrictions.  <BR> <BR>I hope I have set your minds to rest. <BR> <BR>So
    may I have your opinion on what would be the proper program to do it? <BR> <BR>Rodrigo

  body: Rodrigo has a question about how to combine an italic and a roman from two
    different typefaces. Dan has already pointed out that the EULA&#40;s&#41; might
    not allow modifications. Dan has also pointed him toward FontLab and TypeTool.
    However Rodrigo cannot afford FontLab and doesn&#39;t think TypeTool can do what
    he needs. As he is only doing this to test his own writings it seems he needs
    something more along the lines of cut and paste. Are there any other, less expensive
    apps available, I assume for non-type designers?

  body: If the fonts are TrueType or OpenType format, one could do this for free using
    Just van Rossum&#39;s <a href="http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/">TTX</a> tool,
    which dumps an sfnt font to a human-readable/editable XML document, which can
    then be turned back into a font with the same tool. This, as I say, is free, but
    it does require that one knows one&#39;s way around inside the font tables. For
    Rodrigo&#39;s purposes, I think he can achieve his aim simply by editing the &#39;name&#39;
    table &#40;for a TT font; PS might be more complicated&#41;.

    other high-end fonts&#41; are not pixelfonts; neither do they contain any &#34;true&#34;
    embedded bitmaps. They&#39;re super-hinted, which means they include special TrueType
    instructions, tailored to each point &#40;actually PPEM&#41; size, to distort
    the outlines so that they render out as nice bitmaps at those sizes. Yeah, I think
