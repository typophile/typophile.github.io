body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for a font to pair with Goudy Old Style. I\u2019m
  using GOS for the body text of a fantasy novel that takes place in ancient times,
  and I initially thought I might use Goudy Trajan (with swashes perhaps) for the
  chapter headers. \r\n\r\nHowever, I thought that Trajan would be cliched, and I\u2019m
  leaning toward using Goudy\u2019s Forum Titling instead for a fresher use of \u2018ancient
  Rome\u2019 fonts. The Lanston Type Company suggests 'hybridizing' GOS lowercases
  with Forum Titling's capitals, but I wondered if it might work if I used them as-is.
  I\u2019m open to other options to pair with GOS, of course, just so long as the
  font evokes that ancient feel.\r\n\r\nThere is one caveat \u2013 I may need the
  font to be available for ebook licensing."

  body: What about Goudy Oldstyle suggests "ancient" to you? That's not an association
    that I think many typographers would have. Maybe look for a better body font before
    choosing a display font.

  body: "Goudy Old Style is a fantasy inspired by ancient times. \r\nThat sounds about
    right.\r\n"

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI see clarity is needed here -- I was asking for a Chapter Title
    header font (not a body font) that evokes ancient times. I specifically named
    two fonts that made this wish abundantly clear; I've never heard of writing body
    copy in Trajan. It's a type of font that could only be used for titles, etc.,
    yes? The question was what <strong>title</strong> font is a useful alternative
    to Trajan in this context? \r\n\r\nI've found another source to answer this question,
    so thanks anyway."
