body: "Help!\r\n\r\nI have a client writing a book/dictionary in Word on a PC. When
  I open it on my mac several of the phonetic characters disappear and an underline
  replaces it. When I open the file it doesn't ask for a font and it is using Times
  New Roman. Does Times New Roman on a PC have more characters than Mac? Thoughts
  suggestions ideas?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm suddenly realizing that I might need to use
  a different typeface for the book, a typeface which contains all the phonetics which
  might be used in a dictionary.\r\n"

    completely helpless. But, jeez, I feel it.

    believe, the answer depends on which version of Window the user is running. i've
    heard that TNR which ships with Vista has been updated and expanded. TNR version
    3.0 doesn't seem to have any IPA extensions."

    license you the Vista version of TNR?"

  body: Short answer. Microsoft Word on the mac doesn't see the glyphs the same. I
    opened the same file in Text Edit and InDesign and all glyphs were present and
    accounted for. :^/ Derr!

    Correction... I think it's more like what you said earlier -- your client may
    be using the Unicode version of Times New Roman. If I remember correctly, Times
    New Roman Unicode does have extra characters in it -- not as complete as Arial
    Unicode, maybe, but those phonetic characters might be in there. I can't confirm
    this since I am no longer at my old job, where I had a Mac <strong>and</strong>
    a PC... Sorry. Anyway, there is more info <a href=\"http://clagnut.com/blog/161/\"

    target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
