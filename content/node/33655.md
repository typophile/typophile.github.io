  web site that I've been hired to modify, and there's no original, unlayered copies
  of the image.  Thanks!

    will be useful for me, is there?\r\n\r\nSorry for all the n00b questions - I'm
    a code monkey by trade.  Not so much with the graphics end of things..."

  body: Oh, and here all this time I've been thinking that .afm stood for Adobe Font
    Manager, and that the files were only important if you used AFM for your font
    management. So are .afm files actually still necessary? Thanks for the link, Yves.
