  body: Disparate or desperate elements? ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Personally, this seems like
    a can-of-worms debate. Mixing the terms &#39;graphic design&#39;, &#39;postmodern&#39;
    and &#39;art form&#39; will only lead to an infinitely long discussion with few
    conclusions. ;o&#41;

    <BR>Hmm..I&#39;m just wondering if I could get away with handing in a message
    board thread as an essay. <BR>Let&#39;s open this can of worms..

  body: Okay, so maybe I&#39;m being a tad cheeky and, ahem, lazy by trying to get
    others to answer, but can anyone help me at least try to uderstand what sort of
    issues the tutor would expect me to discuss, I really have no idea how to start.
    It seems like such a broad question!

    and collage are adequate definitions of Post-modernism. <BR> <BR>Then, try to
    disprove the statement by finding some historical examples that are not collage/montage/Pomo.'

  body: My essay has been changed to &#34;Why have we seen a return to the handmade
    over recent years?&#34; <BR> <BR>As designers, as opposed to students, I was curious
    as to whether you have noticed a return to handmade processes within graphic design
    and more specifically typography. If so has this had any significant effect on
    firstly the industry and secondly the way in which you personally work?

  body: '&#34;It seems like such a broad question!&#34; <BR> <BR>Well, yea, I completely
    agree...hence my original comment. ;O&#41; <BR> <BR> &#34;Why have we seen a return
    to the handmade over recent years?&#34;  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say a&#41; people are
    nostalgic and b&#41; the dot-com bubble was the pinnacle of digital everything...graphics,
    music, internet, PDAs, etc. and had no place to go but down. <BR> <BR>In terms
    of personal work, I used to work here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.blincpublishing.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.blincpublishing.com</a> <BR> <BR>which, at the time,
    was a small web firm &#43; letterpress printing shop. A nice mix. I guess I&#39;d
    say that affected my work by giving me the motivation and tools to easily experiment
    outside of the computer. Granted, a lot of what we did there ended up with the
    letterpressed aesthetic, which for us was a nice selling point.'

  body: So, would it be fair to say clients &#40;particularly those with a knowledge
    of pritning processes&#41; would prefer something that&#39;s been pressed as opposed
    to digitally printed? <BR> <BR>The work on that site looks nice, I&#39;m quite
    intrigued by the Geek Squad!

    Clients come in all shapes and sizes ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>A lot of our clients were
    actually other design firms that, obviously, knew of printing methods and media.  <BR>
    <BR>That said, we also had a lot of wedding/event invite type stuff where people
    were, IMHO, looking for something more unique. Not necessarily in look, but in
    terms of production. ie, it added a bit of perceived value to the piece when there
    was that tactile response &#40;the impression of the type, the thicker paper stock,
    etc.&#41; We had to hit the paper hard because people wanted to emphasize the
    fact that it was letterpressed. True letterpress shouldn&#39;t really advertise
    the fact that it was letterpressed. <BR> <BR>Also, folks just found it fun to
    dig through the type cabinents. <BR> <BR>&#34;Also, when Microsoft was founded
    how substantially did this affect graphic design?&#34; <BR> <BR>In terms of producing
    work, not at all. <BR> <BR>&#34; Also why was the introduction the apple so popular?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Because it was unlike anything else at the time. It had a mouse, you
    moved the mouse and it did things on screen. The original apps were geared toward
    the visual arts. It had the first set of fonts that weren&#39;t monospaced, etc.'

    words to go! I managed to get an extension until Monday, though. <BR> <BR>Why

    that the average graphic designer spends about seventy five percent of his or

    but... if you are asking these questions, then you have not done too much research.
    There are plenty of books at your local library, and sites on the internet if
    a library is not an option, that tell the story of personal computers, and the
    software programs, that had an effect on the way typesetting and graphic design
    work in general was done. <BR> <BR>Get thee to a library, Matthew!  :-&#41;'

    think the rest of the library would appreciate so much coughing. I&#39;ve tried
    searching the internet, but have not really found any useful sites. I found an
    interview with Bill Gates which took me about two hours to read, but just ended
    up confusing the hell out of me.

  body: Well, there are other technologies that had a hand in changing the way graphic
    designers did their work... computers alone didn&#39;t do it... There had to be
    a way to make type look good, there had to be a way to transfer what you did on
    a computer to paper &#40;hint, hint&#41;... <BR> <BR>Good luck and feel better.
