  some reason I think there used to be a built -in printer font on my old Epson FX-80
  that was supposed to look like a calligraphic typeface. Do you think that is what
  was used for this sample? Does anyone remeber the name of it, and do you know of
  a digital version? (I searched the most likely Dafont.com's 'Gothic' categories
  and found no match.)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n- Mike"

    Venice perhaps?

    the FX-80 era (designed a bunch of them myself, that was my entree into digital

    It's Venice 14.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonts_on_the_Mac\r\n\r\nAnother

    get some kind of special props for this, don't I?"

    Venice is by Bill Atkinson, not Susan Kare. She was my first thought too.

    still using my Atari 800 with my Epson, but we had Macs in work, and I recall
    Venice now. (I used to design FX-80 printer fonts too.)\r\n\r\nThanks Stephen
    and Raph. Good memories!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
