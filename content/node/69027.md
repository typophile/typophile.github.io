  2 forums that I participate in.  One member recommended typophile so here I am!\r\n\r\nThis
  is for a local customer, they had a logo created on some freelancing website, and
  all they were provided was a 96 dpi .jpg.  Basically I have to recreate this as
  a vector graphic, and I can't find this font ANYWHERE.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
