    Bolt</a>. The numerals are the actual italics of Cooper Black.   <BR>  <BR>Thank
    God for real italics, I say. Or, you know, whoever invented them.

    Still, I poked around MyFonts anyway. Go figure: I typed &#34;Space&#34; in the
    search box, and this font came up about 40th or something &#40;not to give any
    of my top-secret sleuthing methods away or anything...!&#41;. I was shocked, frankly,
    that this was a commercial font, though I will say I like it better the way it
    was originally designed, not slanted. <BR> <BR>As to the question, &#34;what&#39;s
    up with the cooper black/bolt combo,&#34; I can only say, uh, no comment.'

  body: 'Maybe we should start a new thread just for sharing sleuthing techniques.
    Just generally, however, for my part: I know the names of a good number of basic
    faces, but most of the time I have to look things up. <BR> <BR>The first thing
    I try to decide is whether the font looks like it was done by an artisan or by
    someone who maybe has some skill but is not likely to have his/her fonts distributed
    by the big sites &#40;MyFonts, Agfa, Phil&#39;s, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s
    even close to an artisan font, the first thing I try to use is MyFonts&#39; What
    the Font. That may mean that I have to do some manipulation of the sample to get
    something that What the Font can read well. It&#39;s a surprisingly good sleuthing
    tool. MyFonts carries quite a lot of foundries&#39; work, so I&#39;d say at least
    80% of the queries here can be found on MyFonts. <BR> <BR>Sometimes with MyFonts
    it takes more detailed searches, and sometimes, like today, I just get lucky.
    Often I&#39;ll start with a font I think it looks like, check out the keywords
    listed on that page, and see which one&#40;s&#41; might be relevant to my search.
    &#40;Clicking on &#34;more fonts like this&#34; gives you every font that matches
    even one of those keywords, so it&#39;s often quite a hefty list.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    typically don&#39;t find that Identifont helps me, though it doesn&#39;t stop
    me from trying. What helps in Identifont is to click the link that says &#34;Identify
    from logo,&#34; which really means, you type in what letters are in the logo &#40;case
    matters!&#41;, and Identifont will try to restrict its questions to what it thinks
    you can answer. Its database seems to be far smaller than MyFonts, and I think
    it could ask some better questions, but I have only myself to blame, because I
    never fill out that little feedback form thingy at the end. <BR> <BR>When it looks,
    how shall we say, like it was done by someone who wouldn&#39;t want to work for
    either Adobe or T-26, and vice versa, there are a number of sites I check out.
    It&#39;s quite time-consuming sometimes. <BR> <BR>Sometimes someone asks about
    a font that&#39;s only known about by the most in-the-know, and on those I bow
    to people here who are the artisans themselves, who have stacks of type specimens
    in their libraries. I&#39;m frankly in awe of these people. <BR> <BR>Finally,
    often I end up searching through a bunch of different small foundry sites and
    follow links to others. I don&#39;t usually find what I&#39;m looking for, but
    in these cases, the journey is usually more worthwhile than the destination, as
    I come across tons of interesting fonts that I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. <BR>
    <BR>Other people will have more to add, I&#39;m sure! <BR>'

    why i only have a couple of notches <BR>in my belt &#40;not to mention that there

    while i&#39;m busy <BR>browsing sites and messing with whatthefont <BR>and indentifont,
    someone has casually <BR>identified it. oh well. thanks for the tips.

    thorough. If I fail to identify it at first glance, my first step is similar:
    trying to determine <i>where</i> you need to go looking is a good start. I&#39;m
    more of a &#34;paper&#34; researcher: a combination of FontBook and Rookledge&#39;s
    International Typefinder usually does the trick. If it&#39;s not in there I&#39;m
    pretty useless. <BR> <BR>But I think that&#39;s the strength of this forum: by
    combining the skills of people with different backgrounds and search methods we
    cover a lot of ground, and the fact that we are geographically spread out guarantees
    24/7 Type ID service. Pretty kewl, innit?'
