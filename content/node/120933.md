body: "In Type 1 hinting  using Fontlab if the glyph and component are hinted individually,
  \ will the composite glyph need any hinting? Thanks.\r\n\r\nBy the way I assume
  that Type1 outlines are another name for  PostScript curves..right?\r\n"

  body: For the record- I decomposed a glyph made up of two components. The hints
    appeared on each component properly. In other words the hints followed the outline
    to its new position.
