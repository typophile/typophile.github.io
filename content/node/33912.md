  body: Since it's based on potrace, you will of course be releasing the source under
    the terms of the GPL license, correct?

  body: 'allanm1, like ralph I don''t see a link to the source code on your site.
    Is it available? I''m no lawyer, but as I understand it, any derivative works
    under GPL need to be released under the same license. This is <em>the</em> big
    difference between GPL and BSD licenses. '

    body: "Think you guys need to read the GNU license - source code doesnt need to
      be shipped with the software, but just a written offer to supply it.\r\nIf anyone
      makes a specific request for source, they are welcome to it, it is just a small
      front end to Potrace, though the .gfs section may be of interest to some.\r\n\r\nHow
      about some feedback on the program etc, may be more constructive.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    you're only offering it in response to a written request.\r\n"

      is my first GNU project). Will post on the web site - just need to document
      and comment it out a bit better for public consumption. \r\n\r\nKeep an eye
