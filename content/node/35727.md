    font, you have one that was designed to match perfectly (e.g., you can get rid
    of the fora where people ask \"What sans font goes well with [insert serif font]?\").
    \ The changes might be small or large.  In my font, I have a 5 faces so far, and

    until I'm done with my thesis I can't put in a lot of hardcore work on the font,
    and only get a character or two done every here and there as of late.  But, the
    sample layouts I've done so far have the serif version for the body text, and
    of course italic as necessary.  For captions and footnotes, the sans version is
    being used.  This isn't too unlike a lot of journal style guidelines, where all
    figures and their captions must use sans-serif fonts.  I doubt I'll use the fraktur

    the Fury.  If you've read it, you'll rememmber that flashbacks/forwards were designated
    only by italicising the text.  This was not the original way that Faulkner intended,
    rather, he wanted the different time switches to be represented by type setting
    that entire passage in a different colour.  But, with many pages needing then
    three+ colours, for novel, it was considered too pricey at the time.  (The only
    novel I can think of off the top of my head with a multi-colour printing in that
    style is House of Leaves, where the most commonly available edition prints the
    word \"house\" in blue, all certain passages in red.  The \"full version\" also
    has parts in purple and (!) braille.)  However, one could design a series of faces

    times, basing them off of the different feelings the narrators had on them.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    of something like Storm\u2019s Splendid, but there I cannot trace what is it that
    links these four separate fonts into one family.<\r\n\r\naren't you in essence
    saying that you have discovered you might be asking the wrong question?\r\n\r\nThere
    is no relationship there; it is a frivolous, poorly-conceived gimmick == that
    I hope for Storm's sake sells well. In fact, let's for once be brutally honest.
    There is a relationship: it's called type fatigue. He's done too much.\r\n\r\nWhat
    would be more interesting to explore is the question whether formal relation (between
    for example sans and serif) is desirable or not. This is far from established.
    There is a lot of hype based on the aesthetically unproven assumption that a formally
    related sans and serif are desirable. [Really? Contrast does not exist as a beneficial
    force in art since cave drawings?] Clearly, a lot of this is hype and simply not
    to be taken seriously in a serious study. It is as bad as the assumption (which
    I have never found to be the case) that there exists, anywhere, a designer who
    is equally good at designing serif and sans serif type. I am speaking of course
    only about the very highest level of endeavour.\r\n\r\nEvery effort to form an
    italic from roman models has proved disastrous in the end. The best illustration
    is the very first integrated type family, Romulus. The ideal italic is not formally
    related to a roman; it is above all a contrasting element. Why should this not
    be true also of the sans serif that might be used in contiguous composition? That
    leaves the bold - - - the late 19th century bolds were not slavish replicas of
    romans but simply darker types that happened to work acceptably and agreeably
    with romans. I see no reason why this should not work today. I would even go so
    far as to say that it is more important to have a well-designed, well-implemented
    bold than to have a bold that is closely, literally formally related to the roman.\r\n\r\nThere
    is an impulse in these kinds of discussion that I deeply distrust. That impulse
    is the one that seeks to find a basis for type in some art or graphic theory.
    For me, it must always start at the functional level of the reader and the act
    of reading.\r\n\r\nAs everyone who has ever made a sans from a roman knows, you
    can't stick to the formal recipe blindly. That's because, as you see at once,\r\n\r\n_a
    Sans Serif has a vernacular of its own_\r\n\r\nand that is different from the
    vernacular of a serif typeface\r\n\r\njust as the vernacular of italic is different
    from the vernacular of roman\r\n\r\nTrying to impose unity on a family of types
    is to deny and disrespect that each constituent of a type family may have a vernacular
    and vernacular associations which should be honoured.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, that's
    a possible argument."

  body: "<em>formal parameters</em>\r\n\r\nThese may be considered \"design axes\",
    an idea introduced to explain Multiple Masters.\r\nThis kind of interpolation
    derives, conceptually, from the Knuth metafont, and is \"codified\" in the Univers
    numbering system. \r\nCarl Crossgrove's Relic, with its sober/inebriated axis,
    is an unusually conceived formal dimension, but really there is so much scope
    for imagination -- you can morph between all kinds of formal qualities with software
    like Superpolator: x-height, extender length, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Slant\" is a paradoxical
    design axis, because in modern fonts it can indeed be varied incremementally in
    a purely formal slider-bar way, but in old styles it exists as an abrupt binary
    switch between quite topologically disparate roman/italic forms, or perhaps a
    three-parter (Auto, etc.)\r\nI have termed these Cultural Axes, as the perception
    of a meaningfgul relationship between the poles/instances depends on a cultural
    awareness or knowledge.\r\nBoth formal and cultural design axes can be the basis
    of extended families, although in large OpenType fonts such as Hypatia, these
    may be subsumed within a single font as Stylistic Alternates.\r\n\r\nThe Globe
    and Mail fonts I recently designed leverage a cultural axis. GM News and GM Sans
    share x-height, extender length, stroke widths, some cheirographically informed
    joints, and general horizontal proportions, but the two alternates are conceived
    as the poles of a Humanist/Modernist axis. GM News is \"some serifs\" and old-style,
    whereas GM Sans is plain and modern. In the newspaper, the two variants are used
    in a variety of ways, e.g.\r\n- For text emphasis, highlighting a word in a headline;\r\n-
    For immediate layout contrast, as when a GM Sans overhead sits above a GM News
    headline; the most interesting of these is the contrast between a GM News italic
    (6 degree slant, classic old-style letter shapes) and GM Sans (10 degrees, a slanted
    version of the Roman);\r\n- At the document level: GM News is the headline face
    in the news sections, GM Sans in the feature sections.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.shinntype.com/Specimens/G&M.pdf
    for the type specimen,\r\nhttp://www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf7/CAN_TGAM.pdf for
    the usage (most of the sans fonts on the front page are GM News, but the overheads
    and sidebar text are GM Sans).\r\nThese stylistic variants provide an extended
    design space for modernist page layouts, enabling many ways to contrast text while
    maintaining color and stroke contrast -- this equivalence being important to maintain
    the effect of locating the type on the plane of the page as flat graphic elements,
    without suggesting pictorial depth, which is what happens with stroke contrast.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThere
    are cultural axes in several of my type families, Panoptica being the most diverse
    to the extent of becoming an alphabet system, rather than a typeface.\r\nUnusual
    design axes in some other of my work:\r\nCultural: Eunoia; trendyness -- 1) Art
    Deco (1930s), 2) Op Art (1960s), 3) Techno (1990s)\r\nFormal: Monkey; Spacing
    -- 1) visually pleasing spacing, kerned, 2) tight-but-not touching equidistant
    spacing. 3) monowidth.\r\nFormal: Handsome; writing tool -- \"a choice of pens\".\r\nFormal:
    Fontesque Ornaments -- the family principle applied to ornament, with optical
    scaling, monoline/stressed members, and plain/solid members.\r\nFormal: Brown
    Gothic -- text and display variants of a sans, optically scaling the \"distress\"
    axis."

    in a modernist layout; usually in newspapers, that complexity is organized around
    contrasting sans types with serif types, but serif types undermine the flat graphic
    quality of the modernist layout. The solution was to use all sans display type,
    with contrast between stylistic variants of the same sans face -- \"some serifs\"

    None of your exemplars merit gravitas-containing bandwidth, which is always in
    short supply. All you are doing here is devaluing the meaning of gravitas itself.
    You are using it like an ad-man. Your motives are transparently self-serving:
    self advertisement. A blog is not the best place to do that kind of thing so blatantly,
    because you are bound to get slagged. Save it for your client presentations.\r\n\r\nThe
    only way you can get away with this kind of thing on a blog is to say, 'Folks,
    here's a script I'm going to try on a really naive client. How do you think it'll
    run? What can I do to improve it?'\r\n\r\nYou don't have to worry about the client
    seeing the post. The client who buys that kind of hype probably doesn't read type
    blogs.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime has anyone got anything serious to say about Peter's
    original question? It seems he is not going to have an easy time writing this
    article. It looks like the one historically important designer who tried to conceptualize
    a wide-ranging type family was van Krimpen, and further, that it was most notably
    a failure in several respects. Of the two italics, one couldn't be set, and the
    other couldn't be stood. The sans experiments weren't successful either. It strikes
    me as significant that this is a subject very little discussed by the older generation
    of type designers -- those who really know how to design type -- such as Stone,
    Carter, Unger, Zapf, Frutiger, etc. It's also significant that there is no attempt
    in Font Bureau's ambitious Poynter family to embrace this kind of light aesthetospeak.
    I am almost ready to dismiss the talk of relationships as pure salesmanship. \r\n\r\nOh,

    is possible, for obvious reasons (i.e, the word only exists in type to describe
    practical, interpolable extremes; style is probably usually the best word to describe
    something that is related but not interpolable). Some use was made of interpolation

    with reference to my own work.  \r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe term \"cultural axis\" is
    a serious answer to Peter's question about the Splendid family -- as well as sharing
    common physical qualities such as x-height, sharpness, and high contrast, they
    are joined by a \"cultural axis\": a place, a time. Another cultural axis is that
    they are being marketed as a package -- present day technological and economic
    considerations are involved in that (sorry, bit of a circular argument). Implicit
    too is the understanding that these kinds of faces are often used together, again,
    a cultural understanding of genre. But was the Splendid concept successful? Have
    art directors produced layouts with three or four of these fonts together on the
    same page?\r\n\r\nThe issue here: although non-interpolatable styles may be part
    of the same family, is it more a conceptual or taxonomic kinship than a functional
    one? To what extent do typographers create layouts using both the sans and serif
    versions of a typeface? How much contrast is enough? As an art director, the only
    time I've used sans/serif contrast within a family, sort of, was combining with
    Perpetua and Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nIn her talk on Morris Benton at TypeCon, Juliet
    Shen noted that his Clearface types -- the serif and the sans  -- were closely
    related physically, and placed a few pages apart in the same section of the 1923
    ATF catalog. So the relationship ATF presented was a bit vague and unrealized,
    in terms of physical kinship, marketability, and usability (they were not shown
    in the same faux layout).\r\n\r\n"

    you say axis is a connecting line, that's all.\r\n\r\nBut that's not what it means
    in type. It has a special technical meaning, specifically given to it probably
    by Adobe, or if not Adobe, one of the early workers in interpolation, such as
    Karow or Harper. It would be interesting to discover exactly when the term was
    first used, how it was defined -- it probably was defined, etc.\r\n\r\nSince axis
    has always been used thus in type -- why add to semantic confusion and change
    it now? \r\n\r\nAlso, is axis really flexible enough for what you want to talk
    about? Why confine yourself to a line? I really think there must be a better word.
    What is it that you want to describe? It seems to me that you want to describe
    the relationship between two typefaces that do not necessarily have a linear or
    even predictable relationship. So why use a word steeped (or mired) in linearity?
    \r\n\r\nWhy make a word that means line not be a word that means line? (For as
    long as there's a line, interpolability is implied, is it not?)\r\n\r\nYou're
    not talking linearity here, but something more like spousal, neighbour, orbital
    (?) (rather than axial!) -- I can't think but there must be something better."

  body: "<em>What\u2019s wrong with the previously-used word, style?</em>\r\n\r\nThere's
    not much wrong with it, and it is used in OpenType -- Stylistic Sets.\r\nBut \"style\"
    has a lot of meanings, and is thus vague.\r\nThe advantage of using the term \"design
    axis\" is that its focus serves to distinguish interpolable relationships from
    non-interpolable, which is the whole point of this exercise.\r\nAs you have noted
    with Today, weight is a design axis that may often be non-interpolable. In this
    respect, Times Roman is similar, and many Didone Italics have median serifs that
    are hooked in the regular weight, but flat in the bold weight.\r\n\r\nWorking
    on the modern/oldstyle versions of the Globe sans types, I found that what I was
    doing, for the purpose of adequate differentiation, was trying to drive the styles
    as far apart as possible, to the poles of their relationship, as it were -- so
    this too suggested that the relationship was axial.\r\nAnd within this major modern/oldstyle
    axis, I found there were sub-axes; for instance horizontal proportion -- varied
    in the oldstyle, more equal in the modern; terminal treatment -- angled and slightly
    bent in the oldstyle, straight and perpendicualr in the modern; joint style --
    pronounced in the oldstyle, neat in the modern. In each of these \"parts of speech\"
    of the design grammar, I had the option of varying the amount of difference between
    the two polarities.\r\n\r\nHere's something from 1938, \"The following Alternate
    Characters are put up in separate fonts at quoted prices and when used with Series
    No. 140, shown on preceding page, gives a very pleasing effect.\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tourist_3546.jpg]"

  body: "Nick, the illustration is really interesting, can you tell us more about
    it, the foundry, the seller, the book? Is this an old Sol Hess design? I hate
    to say it, but I see here a possible genesis for the alternate characters in what
    is surely one of the most original of all typefaces, Renner's Steile Futura. How
    could <em>anything</em> in Steile come from such an undistinguished source? Yet
    it seems inferentially to be the case. Oh, this is awful! Similarly, some of the
    most admirable of Zapf's and Frutiger's ideas can be found in Goudy, in pre-war
    German types, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I wouldn't call them an axis or a
    design axis. What I resent about broadening the term is that it was invented by
    Adobe (if it really was invented by Adobe -- I would want to check this) to mean
    a very specific thing. I think we should respect that specific thing, and come
    up with a different term if style is inadequate. I can see why you are unhappy
    with style, or with some variant thereof, such as 'integrated style'; I can see
    the need for an extension of the terminology -- not, necessarily, as far as the
    type world goes, but as far as the type to management world goes. Isn't there
    some better way of talking about this? \r\n\r\nThat said, what is interpolable?
    The very first Adobe MM with an intermediate master was ITC Garamond MM, which
    had one character which was not interpolable across the 'design axis' (is that
    a correct usage according to my admittedly inept but well-meant plea?) which required
    the intermediate master. \r\n\r\nA definition of a font axis which meant only
    an 'Adobe MM interpolable axis' would therefore still not be completely simple.
    It wouldn't be linear -- although non-linear interpolation may not have been considered
    practical at the time these terms were being dreamed up. But, as we know, the
    Adobe model is incredibly simplistic; we have gone far beyond that conceptually.
    So what are axes? \r\n\r\nI would vote that an axis should be something that is
    either literally linear or very near linear. Some other term is necessary. Is
    'design space' the term we use for the totality of the design? The sum of the
    axes? \r\n\r\nHere's where style should not be extended, obviously as I had naively
    originally proposed. For example, we can speak of the design space, the axes,
    of Minion Roman. The design space, the axes, of Minion Italic are something quite
    different.\r\n\r\nSo, for elements within a design space that are not axes --
    what are they? That's supposing that you are going to limit 'design space' to
    the classic Adobespeak. "

    Peter Bilak interviewed Martin Majoor (feb. 2003) and you can read it here: http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html.
    The part I\u2019m reffering to is: Small capitals come from an old tradition,
    but designing something like Scala Sans Italic Caps was not done before.<\r\n\r\nThis
    transparently self-serving article by Majoor is factually incorrect. But let's
    take just the points you apparently took from it. First of all you wrote that
    italic small caps did not exist before the 1990s. This is completely untrue. They
    have a long history. \r\n\r\nThen you wrote that sans serif small caps were not
    available before Scala. This is equally untrue. The first sans serif superfamily,
    explicitly containing every possible feature, was Today, as Majoor perfectly well
    knows. The other thing to keep in mind of course is that in metal you don't need
    an explicit small caps weight because you can usually use the caps of a couple
    of sizes smaller, and because of the optical reproportioning, they will have the
    correct appearance.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of optical reproportioning, Today has two
    optical sizes, Scala has only one, so it is still behind the curve. \r\n\r\nNow,
    further to test some of Majoor's claims about Scala, do yourself a favour. Set
    some paragraphs in Scala, and make sure you have plenty of instances of words
    set between the right and left single quotation marks. Things like 'this', etc.
    -- the kind of thing you often find in the kind of museum catalogues that Scala
    is often used for, in fact. Find out what is wrong with these sentences, and find
    out why it is wrong, which will require a little detective work. Hmmmm. A lot
    of thought went into making that mistake -- which I think may be unique in type
    history.\r\n\r\n'It is my conviction that you cannot be a good type designer if
    you are not a book typographer. I am not talking here about display types but
    about text types. A type designer must know how type works in a piece of text,
    he must know what happens with the type on different sorts of paper, he must know
    how a typeface behaves with different printing techniques.'\r\n\r\nYou can say

    people at Lino (amongst them Kaczun) originally at the behest of National Geographic,

    in the least authentic, artistic, aesthetic, or anything like that. But they are
    awfully functional -- and isn't that what type is supposed to be? PS anyone whose
    only acquaintance with Fairfield is the digital should go out and find some metal

    with Optima slanted. For me the focus on these problems is trite. What Optima

    sizes and weights of Times New Roman, you would be hard pressed to say they were
    related ... obviously they are, but not very closely and in some cases scarcely
    at all. The relationship is more a matter of intention than of organic fact. Another
    way of saying what you have already said. So in Times metal, there's a lot of
    apparent conceptual conflict, but functionally, it all seems to have worked out."

    there isn't such an intellectual structure existing yet. The substitute for that
    I have seen is direct comparison of glyphs across weights to describe how they
    go bold for instance; or between a glyph - such as a lc a between two fonts -
    made by the same person. So while I understand the urge - I think the whiffly

    required that family members should share one or more interpolable dimensions
    (vertical metrics, stroke contrast, and stem width are most obvious\" -- so take
    the Romulus family. Cancellerasca Bastarda does not share similar vertical metrics,

    was basically found impossible to manufacture, wasn't it? Today I think we would
    say that the idea is not only bad mechanically but aesthetically? We always have
    to go back to Romulus because it is historically the first superfamily. And in
    fact, it was so disastrous that the idea of the superfamily was killed for a good
    many decades. On the other hand, I am beginning to become convinced, or at least
    hopeful, as to what you say about size-opt type becoming popular. Mono and Lino
    sold made some size-optimized photo masters (admittedly not necessarily very good)
    and found they didn't sell. Getting them, or rather it, interested in size-opt
    type is tough, I've been trying for years; the institutional memory is long. The
    foundries you've mentioned are all boutiques except for Adobe. Still, it's beginning
    to become something of an aggregate. Is anyone besides Sumner Stone doing type
    in a real optical series? (Stone Cycles is available in 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 24, and
    36 point.) In the past I would have agreed that it is easier to make an optically
    optimized size than a bold italic. Now I'm not so sure. Sure, it's easy to do
    acceptably. It's easier to do so it's better than a single master. But to do it
    optimally? An ever present mystery, never solved in metal, is how do you adjust
    the weight relationships so that the sizes are harmonious when several are presented
    on the same page? At any rate, it's good to hear that more designers are making
    the type available, and that people are actually buying the stuff. In the mid-90s
    there was a PC version of Word that would recognize if an Adobe MM with optical
    axis was being used and would automatically select the right optical size. A decade
    later, where are we? One of the major reasons why OpenType does not include MM
    is that nobody could get David Glen at Microsoft to realize that there was a difference
    between scalable type and type with an optical axis. A paradox is that the original
    Adobe optical axes were poorly conceived in their MM incarnation; in their fixed,
    current states, some have been advantageously redesigned. But what happened to
    the idea that OT was going to recognize 'opticals' and automatically select them
    appropriately? \r\n\r\nEben, I would like to answer your question but what specifically

    sizes -- provided by Adobe -- than have specifically bought (licences for) such
    optically scaled fonts. There is no way of knowing what percentage of this group
    uses the feature, but it seems reasonable to suppose that if someone decides to
    use, say, Minion, and the application sub-menu then offers a choice involving
    optical sizes, they will make a typographically informed selection.\r\n\r\nThe
    independent foundries which earn their entire income from fonts (notwithstanding
    the odd piece of \"merch\") must justify their investment in product development
    with related sales. So even without seeing the sales figures, one must assume
    that the practice of producing optical sizes is market-driven. I've designed two
    versions of Jenson, and Nicholas (display) sells better than Goodchild (text),
    although Goodchild's lack of small caps etc. may have something to do with that.
    As a matter of course, I produce text and display versions of most of my serifed
    typefaces (even Fontesque), and I suspect a large number of independent foundries
    do the same. \r\n\r\nAnd if on the one hand there are hordes of graphic artists
    with many optically scaled fonts they never use, on the other hand there are a
    few optically scaled fonts that are read by hordes -- namely newspaper readers,
    for the use of special headline fonts is widespread. And some papers, quite often
    the ones with the largest circulation, go so far as to use variants for several
    different sizes.\r\n\r\nThe idea of size-specific font selection being done automatically
    by the OS or app (in a similar manner to Quark's implementation of size-specific
    tracking via a \"tracking table\") is intriguing, but not a priority with application
    developers, although I did discuss it with one at TypeCon recently, and he seemed
    to think it was viable. \r\n\r\nTo return the thread to its originator, Peter's
    Greta presents an interesting resolution to the problem of scale, fit, and press
    gain.\r\nGreta has four axes: weight (4 instances), size (3 instances), horizontal
    scale (two instances, at the smallest size instance only) and grade (3 instances,
    at the smallest size instance only). That sums up the state of the art.\r\n\r\nThe
    peculiar economy of the font business, skewed by app and OS bundling, has shifted
    the dynamic of independent font development towards scripts on the one hand, and
    custom news and publication design on the other, neither of these markets being
    addressed by Apple, Microsoft, or Adobe. That's cool, because there are extremes
    of size usage in editorial design (far more than one sees in advertising these
    days). The independent foundries are following the money, and this is driving
    the innovative development of size-specific typography."

    I've found it to be quite useful for my own thinking about type. In that spirit,
    I'll add another interesting case of typefaces related in a non-standard manner
    -- from Storm, in fact. This type is [[http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-63-antique|Antique]],
    which, as far as I can tell from the description on the site, combines three Baroque
    faces of the same period from Paris, Vienna, and Prague. They are united by a
    common x-height and color, a revival that does not smooth out the rough and slightly
    awkward areas, and a similar style/contrast, but all three are quite distinct
    entities. The italics are even more divergent. Since at text sizes these would
    all be far too similar to provide contrast within text, it seems like they function
    more like the grades in certain newspaper types (e.g. H&FJ's Mercury Text), with
    the goal of allowing the designer to root around in very similar variations until
    the ideal one is found. I'd really like to know how Storm sees them being used
    in tandem.\r\n\r\nStorm also has [[http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-25-lexon-gothic|Lexon
    Gothic]], in which the bold weights are nearly sans-serifs.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else
    is reading this, I'm personally eager to find more information on very distinct
    typefaces that were designed to work together. I haven't come across any examples
    other than Storm's Splendid Quartet (and perhaps now Antique) and Kai Bernau's

    \r\n\r\nTwo questions: 1) Is matching these proportions and color the entirety
    of what you did within the Modern Suite and Brown/Worldwide, or did you work with
    other aspects to harmonize the components (maybe creating more similar letterforms
    than each would have on its own, etc.)? \r\n\r\n2) What was your rationale for
    making Scotch Modern's proportions match those of Figgins Bold instead of Regular?
    Was it because you envision Scotch and Figgins Bold being combined on a page more
    often than Scotch and the Regular?\r\n\r\nAnd, Kris, the idea of relation because
    of a single creator is heartening; I'll bestow the same traits on my typefaces
    and they'll automatically be sympathetic! I have to imagine that Gill knew that
    Joanna looked a lot like Gill Sans but considered those forms to be near-ideal,
    similar to how I imagine Unger and Spiekermann going about some of their types."
