I think you're making the &quot;fauve&quot; look really work, and some of the stuff (like the &quot;t&quot;) is very interesting - but I'd have to think about those a bit more. <BR> <BR>For starters, I would recommend making the ascenders slightly taller. And your inclination angle is 4 degrees (right)? I would go for a nice integer slope, maybe 1/15 (=~3.81 degrees), so you can manually control your slopes during font editing pretty easily. <BR> <BR>BTW, could we see a character set? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">For starters, it is strictly illegal for you to work on anything other than Pill Gothic until it is brought to the rabid masses :-) Seriously. <BR> <BR>I also like what you have working here. Did you use the wireframe + brush + cleanup technique on this one? My guess is no, but just curious. Also, the slope is intended to compensate for backslanting in a semi serif right? While it's balancing nicely now, did you try it a bit less, perhaps half of current? The reason is I'm wondering if people will pass over your design because &quot;there's only italics.&quot; <i>On a side note: Hrant, please explain in more detail the benefit of having the slope as an integer for &quot;font editing.&quot; </i> <BR> <BR>I think some of your spacing issues are coming from the length of your serifs on many of the characters in addition to the ear on the g. I'm looking specifically at the top of the i, p, n, r, v. Compare the top serif of the n with the top of the m. I might even reduce all the x-height, left-pointing serifs to (or slightly less than) the current m. This might allow it to be balanced with less sloping. <BR> <BR>Toothy is good. Lots of sparkle coming off this one. Keep at it, your stuff is very nice. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; please explain in more detail the benefit of having the slope as an integer <BR> <BR>Well, you should use a measurement that's most convenient to work with. Degrees are really an arbitrary unit in digital type design - slopes on the other hand have an inherent usefulness. <BR> <BR>For example, let's say that -because of the admittedly established practice of using degrees- you want an angle of about 12 degrees. Doing a Tangent on that and then inverting it, you get ~4.7, so you would choose 5 (which comes back to ~11.3 degrees). Now that you have a slope of 1/5, you know that for every +5/-5 units you move vertically, you need to move +1/-1 unit horizontally. It's not only easier to work with, it reduces rounding issues too. <BR> <BR>BTW, Randy has a point about the inclination angle (assuming there will be an italic down the line). If you reduce it* you will have room for more incline for your italics. Otherwise you can use the same angle for the italic, but you'll have to make it ridiculously cursive for it to stand out, and you'll still have problems - the main functional distinction of an italic (to a user, if not a chirographer) is its slant. <BR> <BR>* But not below 1 degree, or ~1/57 - or better 1/50, 1/55 or 1/60 for convenience. In practice it seems that any slope less than about 1/30 will start getting problematic at smaller sizes. I use 1/16 for Patria Italic (and Harrier) - I have a preference for powers of 2. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here is another pdf. Randy, good call on the serifs. As for the slant, I'm still trying things. To be honest, I just obliqued the characters at two and four degrees. As for pill gothic. I'll get back on it. Up to this point I have mostly done type design as an escape. It's relaxing. So generally I have avoided most of the really tedious technical aspects of producing a professional font. I'm getting more excited about things like kearning pairs and stuff, but I don't know if I will ever really get into hinting.

The serifs could all possibly come in a bit more for tighter spacing needs. <BR> <BR>Yeah I hear you on the technical side. Nothing says you have to do this yourself though. Have you sent Pill to any distributers? They would gladly do it for you, might take some percentage points off the royalty but after all, this is supposed to be an escape not a headache :-) In my amature opinion, you have incredible instincts for type design. Let someone with incredible instincts for delta hinting do that, and focus on the fun part.  <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian, you don't need a &quot;perfect&quot; font - it depends mostly on what your customers expect. Emigre fonts for example have minimal kerning pairs (I think Mrs Eaves has 40-something), but a lot of people have drooled over them. The more you can do the better, but don't get discouraged from publishing your work. Plus a lot of the automatic stuff does serve adequately - like the autohinting in FontLab. The only technical skill I can think of that truly requires a good handle is base spacing. <BR> <BR>Looking at the PDF: <BR>1) I think &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are slightly too large. <BR>2) I think the new ear of the &quot;g&quot; is super. <BR>3) I prefer the new non-descending &quot;f&quot;. <BR>4) Those double-dots on &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are distracting. <BR>5) I'm starting to think that the &quot;t&quot; needs a more &quot;normal&quot; tail - and more horizontal presence. <BR>6) Try to give the tail of the &quot;y&quot; more presence. <BR>7) Some of the color is off - like the &quot;o&quot; is much darker than the &quot;n&quot;. <BR>8) I think 2 degrees (or ~ 1/30 :-) is better than 4. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is very comfortable to read. Call it &quot;type design as an escape&quot;!  <BR>I really think you could use even less inclination, like Hrant says. <BR>I agree on the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; dots as well: try to break them using some angularity. <BR>Same goes for the &quot;y&quot;: experiment with the tail or the whole letter. <BR>I think the &quot;a&quot; needs just minor adjustment. It's very good. <BR> <BR>A separate note on spacing: I would not call spacing &quot;a tachnical skill&quot; as Hrant did. It's as much important as the design itself, maybe more. As long as you care about spacing good since the early stages of a design, you will very likely need minimal kerning. Of course it depends on the design, but I would not use automated tasks of the software.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've toned down the wacky character widths, and added some small caps. I agree that the spacing is nearly as important as the design of the glyphs. When I took my first font into fontographer, I was terribly depressed at the result. I had worked for hours, focusing on each letter, and the text setting looked like garbage. I didn't realize it at first, but the spacing was the real problem. <BR> <BR>That being said, changing character widths and shapes in this font has made a world of difference in the text setting. The best example is the g. I still have spacing issues to resolve, though. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: sample_28-23897.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*33.8*28+PDF*sample_28%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">28 PDF<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/sample_28-23897.pdf" target="_blank"><b>sample_28.pdf</b></a> (33.8 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Christian. <BR> <BR>Magically Delicious! <BR> <BR><i>I still have spacing issues to resolve, though.</i> <BR>One i notice is due to the structure of the t. Given your angle, you can afford a bit more length to the left than usual, but the crossbar is now über left. Otherwise I don't find the over all structure too extreme. <BR> <BR>Also note the path gremlin in the upper case W. <BR> <BR>I like the UC. Fits like a champ. The new s is super BTW. One stylistic question I would explore were it my baby: what about beaks instead of teardrop terminals on the a, c, r (kinda like the s only heavier)? Might be more in keeping with the overall toothy quality. The others are ok now, just thought it might be worth exploring? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy <BR> <BR>(you are a busy man)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian, <BR> <BR>This face has the most potential of any you've posted. Once <BR>Pill Gothic is out the door you should give it your full attention. <BR> <BR>I am not a believer in Hrant's light italic ideas. The italic <BR>should contrast with the roman by a change in design and  <BR>slope, not weight. Color should be even throughout the <BR>typeface's styles. <BR> <BR>Hrant is right about the 'f' crossbar and I think it carries  <BR>over to the 't' as well, as Randy said.  <BR> <BR>The overall spacing is just right. If anything, it's too tight.  <BR>The 'tt' spacing (see &quot;shatter&quot;) is evidence of that. Any <BR>tighter and it would require a ligature. But Hrant is right on  <BR>the spacebar.</div>

Probably just my eyes used to convention, so it's a minor quibble. <BR>2. The overall color seems a bit dark for my taste. <BR> <BR>ok one more: The bottom of the 3 looks a little wonkey. The placement of the corner seems consistent. Maybe it is the upward angle at the end. Typically it should follow more like the 5.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I printed this one up&hellip; <BR> <BR>- Your combo glyphs are screwy. I am not a path master so <BR>I don't know what went wrong, but the 'W', 'fl' and 'ff' ligs are <BR>messy where they overlap. You can see it in the PDF on <BR>screen and when printed it goes white. <BR> <BR>- Color is perfect. Don't change a thing. Dark is in, and for <BR>good reason. <BR> <BR>- I think the ascending 2 is ok. I always thought it was too <BR>squashed to be lc. I can see how it's unnerving for those of <BR>us who aren't used to it, but I think it works. <BR> <BR>- Looks like you've tightened the 'tt' kern. The touch looks  <BR>ok at the small size, but any larger might be a problem. I <BR>suppose this is a good time for me to request a display <BR>version for larger sizes. ;) <BR> <BR>- Randy is right on the 3. Maybe if you shorten and lighten  <BR>that bottom stroke it will clean up.</div>
