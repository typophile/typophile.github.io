    also early adaptors of new approaches, like f.x. serving postscript outlines in
    larger sizes. In fact, they seem to be pushing these things, with the rest of
    the gang following a step behind.\r\n"

    and Webink. Sorry.\r\n\r\n(I currently use Webtype because they have the Font
    Bureau <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/catalog/intended/?ts=829\">RE fonts</a>,
    in particular <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/font/ibisre-family/\">Ibis</a>.
    Top of A-list for reading sizes in my opinion. Before I had Typekit and liked
    it a lot, too. Larger choice, but not all great for smaller text. Though I didn't
    really look into rendering quality there.)"

  body: "Well being from WebINK I would tend to prefer my own. I am glad you are trying
    them all out. We all have some great fonts with both TypeKit and us having fonts
    from Adobe.\r\n\r\nI am always asked what is the difference between you and TypeKit
    and the most obvious is that we are a pure CSS only solution. I prefer this method
    because it allows development to be as I normally would develop with links to
    my media. A lot of folks don't like the extra JavaScript required to use TypeKit
    but a lot of folks dont find it an issue. We use a powerful CSS implementation
    model that differs from many of the other CSS only services. Most CSS only shops
    link back to a hosted CSS file that uses a traditional @font-face stack of EOT,
    WOFF, TTF calls and allows the browser to determine what file format to download.
    Ours links back to our intelligent servers that determine the OS and Browser version
    and hand back the best format for that browser. This matters a lot since in some
    OS and Browser combinations handing back a WOFF/CFF might not be the best and
    a TTF might be better.\r\n\r\nAnother item to always look at when reviewing the
    service you want to go with is the backbone that their service is on. WebINK is
    on the Amazon Cloud with region locations all over the globe so our fonts download
    from a server closest to the user. TypeKit is on a very good CDN as well. Some
    services might be on the Amazon network but they only download from one location,
    so your visitors in Europe are getting their fonts from the East Coast of the
    US or farther away and this can cost extra seconds on page load.\r\n\r\nI would
    agree that the folks at TypeKit are pushing the industry and that is great for
    all of us. They recently starting serving up WOFF/CFF (postscript outlines) as
    pointed out and we and others will do this as well in the near future. We too
    will push the industry and have some very seasoned software engineers.\r\n\r\nI
    hope you find a service that works for you.\r\n\r\nBrad Dunzer\r\nProduct Manager
    WebINK\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'll also begin with a disclaimer (I work for Typekit). Brad is right that
    Typekit requires JavaScript; we think that layer of JS allows us to serve fonts
    in a way that's more reliable, consistent, and provides more control to the designer.
    You can read more about why we use JavaScript and what it does <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2011/08/11/better-web-font-loading-with-javascript/\">on
    a recent post on our blog</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we're working closely with
    our foundry partners to improve rendering on Windows browsers; switching to PostScript
    for some fonts is a recent step. (Though I should clarify that at this point we
    are not yet sending PS based on the size of the font; though we are considering
    that additional level of control in the future.) We've also done a lot of <a href=\"http://j.mp/typerendering\">research
    on rendering</a> and will be sharing more on that front soon. And we provide browser
    screenshots for all of our fonts, so you can evaluate how they perform before
    using them. "

  body: "Speaking for the WebINK side, there are other differences that spring to
    mind:\r\n\r\n- WebINK also provides a minimum px size rating for every font in
    our system, based on analysis by one or more people viewing browser screenshot
    waterfalls. We're working on also providing waterfalls, but it seems to us that
    knowing what we think the minimum good size is, is pretty helpful.\r\n\r\n- As
    best as I can tell, WebINK has a more heavily curated collection of fonts. Mind
    you, this is probably not as important for typophiles as the general web design
    audience.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    so? For example: \r\nhttp://blog.webink.com/webink/font-rendering-in-web-browsers-a-find-your-font-adventure/\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    we need to blog about it more often, but we certainly have blogged about it, and
    are always ready to talk about it when it comes up, which is often. A lot of TT
    fonts render badly on older browsers on Windows, and even newer Windows browsers
    are not always fabulous at small sizes with all fonts.  :(\r\n\r\nThis of course
    is not an issue that is specific to either WebINK or TypeKit. It's a general challenge
    for web fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "(1) Ah, I understand, then. That feature is on our to-do list. On the other
    hand, we do offer a rating of minimum size so that you don't necessarily have
    to check it yourself under every browser combo. (I'm not saying that either feature
    is a substitute for the other, but if a font is rated as having a minimum safe
    size of 24 px, it's hardly a case of not being \"open\" about rendering issues.)\r\n\r\n(2)
    Yeah, if you use Windows, and have ClearType off (the default on XP, but not anything
    later), and use the wrong browsers, stuff will look worse, including our own site.
    You'll see that rendering on any version of Windows, using Firefox, with ClearType
    turned off. Current Windows versions of IE, Chrome and even Safari all do better,
    even with ClearType off; they will show that text anti-aliased and it looks pretty
    fabulous. Even on XP with IE 7 or 8, for that matter. We could try forcing anti-aliasing
    for that font at such small sizes under GDI greyscale (non-ClearType), but the
    type may get a little too thin if we do.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    ones. I've said many times now that getting to the point where that rendering
    doesn't matter any more can't happen soon enough for me! Different folks may have
    different opinions on when we reach that point; some people are declaring such
    rendering dead already. My take is that it is more than a year away still, maybe
    more like two years? We'll see.  :/\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
