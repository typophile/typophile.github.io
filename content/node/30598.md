body: Does anyone else get annoyed with certain letter shapes in fonts?  For example,
  I can't stand the foot of the R in Gill Sans stretching out well beyond its bowl
  above.  It's as though it's taunting, "Don't even think about auto-kern."  The cockeyed
  serifs of Garamond's T also niggle me.  I want to nudge them like I would an oil
  painting hung askew on a wall.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever used Garamond
  or Gill Sans in any project, probably because I see them as flawed.  Are there others
  who get vexed by a P or peeved by an X?

    course, at 10 points it's a gorgeous book face, so I can live with it."

  body: The question mark in Futura has made a couple of my clients stop in their
    tracks. Also, I know it detracts from the purity of the thing, but Futura's 'j'
    just cries out for the slightest curve to finish off the descender.

    use that finished product on my own projects!\r\n\r\nI dislike any lowercase g
    with a squished lower bowl, like Century Oldstyle. I also can't stand a lowercase
    a where the bowl connects too high i.e. Neuropol.\r\n\r\nThere are so many letter
    forms I could hate on, many including my own previous efforts. Someone should

    squared off lowercase 'a' that so many of their fonts (Priori, Vista) have. Dalliance
    has that awful k.\r\n\r\nI also don't like Gill's R. I prefer an R with a straight
    leg that comes out of the bowl, as in Gotham, Avenir, Trade Gothic and so many
    others. Frutiger's R is also a deal-breaker.\r\n\r\nBut I'm with Matthew, it would

    agree with this. Because Helvetica/Arial has a large x-height and wide characters,
    it will appear large at small nominal sizes. But that is not sufficient reason
    to use it, because IMHO works very poorly as a text font for print. This is not
    just my opinion, but shared by many, including on typophile.\r\n\r\nIt works as
    a display font, though I personally am sick of it.  \r\n\r\n>And those who design

    high competence is a dangerous assumption in any field. I have lots of reference

    this a reference to a Paul Luna thread on the ATypI list where Paul defends his
    use of Arial Black in some dictionary project he was involved in. Of course Arial
    on it's original widths rather than on Helvetica widths is a better design. \r\n\r\nAs
    for use at small sizes - Arial's critics always look at the font at display sizes
    and all fail to credit the ground-breaking hinting and engineering work that went

    It is a completely different animal as a screen font, I think, as the hinting
    quite changes it for the screen. I still like other MS fonts better for the screen,
    namely Verdana and Georgia. And I look forward to using the new clear type fonts.
    \ \r\n\r\nI would be interested to see the Paul Luna design. If there are short
    lines and paragraphs, and adequate leading he might pull it off--not that there
    wouldn't be better alternatives. The more there is continuous text, the worse
    Arial & Helvetica performs, IMHO.\r\n\r\n "
