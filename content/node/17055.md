body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Barnhart Brothers & Spindler</strong>\r\n\r\nOpened
  in Chicago as the [[Great Western Type Foundry]] in 1868. This firm had been founded
  by a family of German immigrants, but had never been very successful. It was bought
  out by the Barnhart Brothers later that same year and remaned Barnhart Brothers
  & Spindler. The Barnhart Brothers were newspaper publishers in Iowa who came to
  Chicago as advertising agents. They got into the type founding business by accepting
  type in lieu of cash for payment on a bill. They retained Herman Spindler as the
  foreman, since he was the only typefounder in the group.\r\nThey competed directly
  with the [[Marder Luse Foundry]] and several sales representatives for New York
  foundries. But the Barnhart brothers were extremely aggressive businessmen and their
  company grew to be the largest in Chicago. Their first type catalogs were small
  pocket size books called \u201Cpony\u201D books still bearing the name [[Western
  Type Foundry]]. Later catalogs increased in format and thickness with the addition
  of many newly designed faces.\r\nIt was finally acquired by [[ATF]] in 1911; it
  closed in 1933. This foundry published many popular and lasting typefaces including
  [[Caslon Antique]], [[Cooper Black]] and [[Caslon Openface]]."
