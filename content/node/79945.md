  I needed help choosing the appropriate tyepface. I'm sort of new to the world of
  type, so go easy on me!\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to shameless self-promotion!\r\n\r\nThis
  image is my submission for Red Truck Foundation's logo design competition! The Red
  Truck Foundation is a non-profit organization that converts multi-terrain vehicles
  like motorcycles and dirt bikes into emergency vehicles. They are present in developing
  countries where many people live in remote areas far away from hospitals and the
  reach of normal emergency vehicle services. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.redtruckfoundation.org/logocontest/vote.htm\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of my logo in comparison to the others? Mine is #9. \r\n\r\nAnyhow,
  please do vote for mine [#9] (if you find it worthy) and check out the Red Truck
  Foundation's website!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.redtruckfoundation.org\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unfortunately, the vast majority of those logos clearly weren't designed
    with any concern for readability, or the ability to be reproduced cleanly in a
    variety of media.\r\n\r\nSince the red cross is such a well-known symbol, I saw
    it as a red cross, rather than a \"T\", which made the logo read as Red Ruck Foundation.
    Even though you've broken apart the cross so it doesn't look exactly like the
    Red Cross logo, I think if the RTF used your logo (or any of the others with a
    red cross in it), they'd be getting some unwanted attention from the Red Cross's
    lawyers.\r\n\r\nThe stencil font you used also doesn't help readability. The \"d\"
    kind of reads as \"cl\"\r\n\r\nYou've got a good start, but there are a few things
    you could do to refine it that would really improve it:\r\n\r\n\u2022 You've got
    three different fonts, and unrelated ones at that. See if you could limit it to
    one or two. If you need to use multiple fonts, you're safer using ones that contrast
    with each other (rather than three different sans serifs) or are from the same
    family (like different weights and/or widths of Franklin Gothic, or Helvetica,
    etc.)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Nothing really aligns. The bottom of the horizontal bar is
    a little lower than the bottom of the \"r\" in \"red\", and the bottom of the
    vertical bar is a little lower than the \"r\" in \"ruck\"\r\n\r\n\u2022 maybe
    try making the horizontal bar the same thickness as the height of the \"r\" and
    the horizontal bar a little wider than that.\r\n\r\n\u2022 What if \"foundation\"
    had less spacing, and went from the left edge of the vertical red bar to the right
    edge of \"k\", and the tag line was the same width\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the
    foundation is great, and I would think they'd want something simple and iconic
    that didn't rely on English text to be understandable. \r\n"

  body: "Thankyou for your response and critique!\r\n\r\nYou make some really good
    points.. the only sad thing is that I can't change it now since it's already been
    submitted. Damn. That really sucks about the red cross. I assumed that since it's
    the commonly accepted symbol for First Aid (which I NOW know is a white cross
    with a GREEN background) it would be okay. Oooooh well. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, if it
    makes it to round 2, it will magically not be a problem since I have split the
    bars. Probably not, but maybe. \r\n\r\nThanks again! I'm still a student and am
    definitely still learning... every bit of constructive criticism helps!"
