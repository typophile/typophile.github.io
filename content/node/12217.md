      the past month for new news. It seems were cutting it really close on schedules,
      right? I mean,  A little over a month. I need to know workshops. If there is
      anything I want to attend before I give out my money. Dig?"

  body: If early registration is 5/16 and it is now 5/8, but "conference registration
    opens soon" isn't that cutting it a bit close? I see a list of featured speakers,
    but where is the workshop list? Pink Floyd knew it was all about money, so where
    is it? The news I mean. I want to register early but not be told I was too late
    with only 1 hour to go. Dig?

    - not a little over a month away.\r\n\r\nWe're still working on the registration
    system and finalizing the workshops. Some great sessions have been developed at
    zero hour that must be worked into the schedule. The complete program schedule
    won't be finalized until later, but that's normal. The complete lineup is great.
    There'll be more speakers on the temp website in the next couple of days.\r\n\r\nHave
    no fear - there will be at least 2 weeks of early registration. We'll move all
    dates appropriately once the registration system is live.\r\n\r\nSorry for any
    confusion, frustration, etc. People are volunteering their time, and sometimes
    it takes  longer than anticipated to get things up and running.\r\n\r\nGuaranteed,
    it's going to be a great show. Paul - I have a good feeling that we'll see you
    there! Gabriel and Eric - I hope you'll be joining us - I know you'll enjoy the
    show and learn a great deal."

    kidding aside, TypeCon is a comfy event. Dress to impress, but in a relaxed way.
