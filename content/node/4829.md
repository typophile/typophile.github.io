  body: This is a hoax. The sample text is carefully selected, and the whole idea
    falls apart as soon as you start trying to apply it to other, longer and more
    complex texts. This was thoroughly debunked last September, when it first made
    the rounds of the Internet.

    type design much easier &#40;and more artsy&#41;. <BR> <BR>Letterwise reading
    fails in the light of both empirical and anecdotal evidence. <BR>It cannot explain
    for example how: <BR>1&#41; Empirical: saccades span about three times the coverage
    of the fovea, with the parafovea unable to convey individual letters. <BR>2&#41;
    Anecdotal: Serifs helps readabililty, and loose letterspacing utterly destroys
    it. <BR> <BR>And there&#39;s something even worse about the letterwise model:
    it goes against the general heuristic mechanism of the brain, which is a fuzzy,
    guesswork-based system. Reading is like Chinese cuisine: nothing gets wasted -
    even the chicken feet are consumed. With the aid of linguistic context, the parafovea
    provides enough clues to identity <i>clusters</i> of letters &#40;which is all
    it can convey anyway&#41;, speeding up reading - why not use the available information?
    <BR> <BR>Immersive reading is a liminal, performance-based task: there is no time
    for separate letters &#40;most of the time&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
