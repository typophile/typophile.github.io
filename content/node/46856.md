  the simplicity and elegance, definitely the timelessness. So no script or handwritten,
  will be in lowercase.\r\n\r\nThis font is for a logo (black type on white bg) for
  a high-end wedding and event photographer if that helps, which it probably doesn't.
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any help...and I'll be sure to link you to the finished article
  so you can see what it looks like.\r\n\r\nAl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I was being kind of facetious, but I meant go all Bringhurst on it. You know,
    pay special attention to kerning, don't mix different typographic eras thoughtlessly,
    use the proper optical weights, blah blah blah.

  body: "Be careful with choosing the appropriate weight of Didot to reverse out of
    black. The high contrast on the 96 point master may make the delicate serifs disappear.\r\n\r\nI
    am conflicted about using H&FJ Didot for luxury brands. It is an exceedingly beautiful
    face, but risks overuse and is often oddly paired with Helvetica--see Harper's
    Bazaar or luxurycollection.com for examples.\r\n\r\nIn my eye,luxury brands typically
    choose serif families with small caps and oldstyle figures, because your average
    MS Word user doesn't have easy access to those characters and so see those as
    unique and exclusive.\r\n\r\nI would look at Joanna (there is a hard-to-find Postscript
    version with SC and OsF), Proforma, Whitman Display, Charter, Miller, Mercury,
    Farnham, Absara, Scala.\r\n\r\nDavid"
