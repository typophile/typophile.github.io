  the majority of their communication is on-screen and also because they like to generate
  their own documents from word (god help me).\r\n\r\nThey have now come to me with
  a book design project and have expressed a desire to use Calibri throughout.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions regarding this will be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time."

  body: "This probably belongs in the \"Design\" forum, but to respond to this, count
    your blessings; Calibri is a nice design. It's not like they're asking for Comic
    Sans. Calibri has exceptional glyph coverage including many ligatures, alternates
    and true small caps. If you utilize these features you might end up with something
    less awful than you're imagining.\r\n\r\nIf there is heavier reading in the book
    I would opt for a serifed book typeface and pair it with Calibri as the display
    and/or caption typeface."

    I posted in the wrong section. :)
