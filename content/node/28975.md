      for your Trapping Flower. To what extent is the model supported by real observations
      on the behaviour of type when printed? I mean, did you run tests, is the model
      useable without further parameters such as type size, paper stock, pressure,
      ink quality, machine speed etc?\r\n\r\nI inquired about this some time ago on
      the PPLetterpress list (in particular my posts from July 18 and 24, 2005). You
      seem not to be on that list (anymore)?\r\n\r\nI am very very much interested
      in this stuff, as I am looking to develop letterpress optimised type. Of course,
      the technology could also be applied to offset printing, flexo, intaglio and
      even to digital laser printing at, say, 600 dpi.\r\n\r\nThe producers of dfRialto
      (which is probably one of the most chirographic faces designed in recent times
      ;) claim to have looked at your Trapping Flower, although it is not clear if
      they actually used it when applying the traps to the Pressa edition of their
      font."

    in any quantified way to things like point size, pressure, etc.\r\n\r\nThat could
    be done of course, but my point was mainly to provide a tool that a type designer
    could use to quickly and consistently implement trapping in a font <cite>once
    he knows what kind/size/frequency traps he wants.</cite> This latter depends on
    various attributes of the font on hand and its intended usage, and is done with
    a mixture of experience and iteration - something I suspect no tool could do for
    you!  :-)\r\n\r\nThe Flower has a lot of power*, but it's still just a tool -
    you have to use it well. And first of all you have to use it; virtually all trapping
    we see out there is pretty shoddy: uneven, inconstant, malformed, you name it.
    Even something like DTL Fleischmann, as wonderful a face as it is overall, has
    pretty laughable trapping. If they had just used the Flower, it would've been
    smooth and silky.\r\n\r\n* For example, it can accomodate asymmetrical bleeding
    (where -usually- the vertical will gain more than the horizontal, mostly due to
    usage of a cylinder press and/or unevenly-bleeding paper) with a simple modification.
    Can you guess what modification?  :-)\r\n\r\nThe Rialto boys (the younger of which
    I met in Rome in 2002 - where I remember we had to communicate in Spanish! :-)
    made their -amazing- Pressa cut before learning about the Flower. They subsequently
    expressed interest in its usefulness, and were enthusiastic about using their
    letterpress experience to some day test a Python script of it. (Don't ask...)\r\n\r\nAs
    for the book: write away, my friend. Sadly at this point I\r\ncouldn't even promise
    to <cite>review</cite> the book you'll hopefully write...  :-/\r\n\r\nBTW, Satya,
    the \"or\" in the subject line of this thread makes me want to point out that
    sometimes visual corrections can become part of the style! Jurgen Weltin's Yellow
    font used by the British phone books is such a case. Also, sometimes visual corrections,
    such as traps, can migrate to the sphere of \"style\", pretty much abandoning
    their original intent; FB Amplitude being the best example of that (and FF Bradlo
    a much earlier such effort).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "> the revolutionary scientific observation that ink bleeds outward. :->\r\n\r\nSo
      why the need for spikes? Ink does \"bleed\" (shrink) inward as well. That's
      precisely why Bell Centennial has those bulky stems.\r\n\r\n> The parameters
      control it quite finely, but are not tied in any quantified way\r\n\r\nThis
      is somewhat contradicting, isn't it? Parameters are of course variable values,
      that are expressed by measurable quantifiers. We only need the right equation,
      measure the variables and there we are. Sure point size is of extreme importance:
      ink bleed is an absolute given, so it will be proportionally bigger in smaller
      sizes. Pressure, stock and machine speed (all measurable) determine the amount
      of bleeding.\r\n\r\n> depends on various attributes of the font\r\n\r\nI don't
      think so. The ink doesn't know whether it is squashing a serif, a high contrasted
      transitional face or one with a slant of 6 degrees. It's just outlines and angle
      width.\r\n\r\n> something I suspect no tool could do for you! :-)\r\n\r\nSure.
      Everything a man can do, a machine can do. If it is understandable, and as long
      as understanding guides a man's doings, it can be programmed. And if it is programmable,
      it can be executed by a machine.\r\n\r\n> DTL Fleischmann, as wonderful a face

      by Typo Art in Berlin, which was renowned for it's build-in ink bleed compensation
      in fonts for photo composition. Do you have showings of the fallacies? (E.g.
      an overlay of printed specimens over the digital outlines.)\r\n\r\n> asymmetrical
      bleeding\r\n\r\nThis is a hard one indeed. I was reading in the Fleuron yesterday;
      the press-work is undoubtedly very good, but I noticed that the lines were thicker
      at their endings. Could it be that this phenomenon caused the invention of those
      eighteenth/nineteenth century tapered lines, that might compensate for this,
      which only later on became a fashionable feature as such?\r\n\r\n> to some day
      test a Python script of it. (Don\u2019t ask\u2026)\r\n\r\nErrr\u2026 Okay, I
      won't. Just, my two cents. I am convinced that building ink traps (etcetera
      etcetera) is not the task of the type designer. It shouldn't even be done in
      the outlines of the font, but at the stage of the RIP. The RIP can be fed with
      all the given variables (such as stock, machine type and speed, pressure, ink,
      etc.), which would allow it to calculate the ink bleed compensation on the fly.
      There is simply no other way, because of the huge amount of parameters. Compare
      it to dot growth compensation in screened images.\r\n\r\n> As for the book:
      write away, my friend.\r\n\r\nI will! Unfortunately I have no time for it either.

    those. Although they're also useful, they tend to be less so, as well as much
    more intrusive. In the photo days of massive definition loss thorns were critical
    in preserving corners, but offset or even letterpress aren't nearly that bad (except
    when the printer is a dork).\r\n\r\nBell Centennial has traps to counter bleeding
    (and optical correction) but the stems are thick not because they get thinner
    during printing! They're thick because: you're probably looking at the Bold Listing
    weight; and small type needs to be heavier.\r\n\r\nInk bleeds in?! If you mean
    the \"halo\" that forms around the outlines of letterforms: I don't see how a

    the Flower is still very useful without such equations because it's a tool for
    efficiency and consistency. A kitchen knife won't make a salad for you, but without
    one you're a caveman.\r\n\r\n> Do you have showings of the fallacies?\r\n\r\nAll

    I don\u2019t think so. \r\n\r\nYou don't think that traps need to harmonize with
    things\r\nlike the vertical proportions, color, etc. of the font?\r\n\r\nIn fact
    even the style of the font matters. For example pronounced, angular traps would
    look totally out of place in something like Garamond #3, but totally harmonious
    in the work of John Downer*. Why? Because in digital type traps can end up being
    visible. This is in fact why some designers avoid traps entirely. But when you
    consider that a font is ideally designed for a not-too-large range of sizes, and
    when you consider that type is all about the details, traps make sense - often
    if not always.\r\n\r\n* Unfortunately Downer is (or at least used to be) a member
    of\r\nthe Slimbach/Porchez school of \"don't ever need 'em\", IIRC.\r\n\r\n> Everything
    a man can do, a machine can do.\r\n\r\nWell then I'm glad I'm not married to you.\r\nI
    don't believe that humans are algorithmic, but heuristic.\r\nA System Cannot Understand
    Itself.\r\n\r\n> This is a hard one indeed.\r\n\r\nNot for the Flower. All you
    need to do is use ovals instead of circles!  :-)\r\n\r\n> I am convinced that
    building ink traps (etcetera etcetera) is not the task of the type designer.\r\n\r\nTheoretically,
    I agree. But as long as that's not a reality on the ground a craftsman can rightly
    worry about traps in his fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso, something you're ignoring: traps
    aren't just about bleed, they fight optical aberrations too. And that can depend
    on things beyond the printer's control like the presumed age of the reader of
    the font (like in a newspaper), the lighting, etc.\r\n\r\n> There is simply no
    other way\r\n\r\nOnly if you think Perfection can exist, and that it's good. Like
    if you think your camera needs to be in Perfect Focus before you hit the button.
    I think Perfection is a succubus. The bottom like is that, in practice, humans
    can benefit from traps in fonts. Anything else is too Modernist, too romantic
    and naive.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    bad printing (letterpress). But it shows the more obvious what happens in _all_

  body: "Satya, if you mean by 'visual correction' a deviation from simple geometrical
    shapes and alignments, then practically every letter has 'visual correction'.
    \r\n\r\nBriem's wonderful web site indicates some of these corrections: the overshoot
    of the o and O, the top half of double story letters being smaller, compensating
    for optical illusions such as the 'bone effect' and 'broken straw' in the X, the
    round vertical arches thicker than the vertical stems etc., etc. But beyond this
    is the adjustment of shapes for uniform color. You could almost say that what
    is specifically typographic in type design is a matter of optical adjustment.\r\n\r\nInk
    trapping, which can be helpful in small type, I would not call optical adjustment,
    but rather design to counteract ink spread and get a different shape in print
    than what you design on screen. \r\n\r\nWhat I would call optical adjustment is
    a matter of designing those final shapes for the eye so that printed letters in
    mass knit together in words and read easily. And that's at least half the battle,
    the other half being aesthetics.    "
