body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI am a big font enthusiast. These days I am looking
  for a laptop. Since Retina MacBook Pro has very high pixel density (220/227 ppi)
  I went to the store to test it.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise, the font looked somehow
  unnatural, strange, too sterile, maybe even too sharp and not so pleasant to read.
  Of course looking at the words and characters, the curves were perfectly displayed.
  Like on a paper. Hardly a pixel was found (unless looking very near display).\r\nThen
  I started to search about that and found these thoughts:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"It needs
  organic noise, otherwise it all looks like dead plastic\"</cite>\r\n \r\n<cite>\"Sharpness
  of type is being celebrated. But that\u2019s not a quality in itself. Just looks
  cold. Type needs a certain amount of fuzziness. Warmth\"</cite>\r\n \r\n<cite>\"New
  iPad is almost \u2018too\u2019 sharp. Fonts were never meant to be so crisp. They\u2019re
  not on paper.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nI have 3 questions:\r\n<ol><li>What are your experiences
  regarding this sharpness and \u201Cunnatural\u201D feel on Retina? Is it maybe that
  some must get used to it?\r\n\r\n<li>As pixels on such great resolutions are smaller,
  the curves are more regularly displayed. Many people said fonts on Retina displays
  are thinner than on Non-Retina ones. What is your opinion? Are they too thin? (If
  yes, there is also an option to change the thickness in Mac OS.)\r\n\r\n<li>Mac
  OS uses subpixel-rendering while iOS (iPad, iPhone) doesn\u2019t. Some people like
  one more than the other. What is your opinion (if you can compare)?</ol>"

  body: "1) I can't say how you would feel about it after living with it for a while.
    I liked it from the beginning.\r\n\r\n2) Text can be slightly thinner, but generally
    is just crisper. I don't find it too thin, just clear. I do not know of any way
    to change the boldness of the rendering (there are some such settings in iOS 7,
    though).\r\n\r\n3) I like subpixel rendering. iOS avoids it for two likely reasons:
    performance, and what happens when the screen is rotated 90 degrees.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Thomas. As of changing the boldness of the rendering in OS X, you
    just have to type in Terminal:\r\n\r\nLight: \r\n<code>defaults -currentHost write
    -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 1</code>\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n<code>defaults
    -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2</code>\r\n\r\nHard\r\n<code>defaults
    -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 3</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(probably
    without subpixel rendering):\r\n<code>defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain
    AppleFontSmoothing -int 4</blockquote></code>"

  body: I'm working with retina display and have never seen typography as thin or
    plastic like on the display. I loved it and everyone around me when sees the display
    they wished they had it too. It makes other displays or medias look blurry and
    fuzzy.

  body: I'm a fan also of the retina screen on my iPad. I'm actually shocked that
    moving from 96 to 135 dpi has made such a dramatic improvement. Are other things
    going on to improve the look?
