  body: It would help greatly if you had a screen capture from the DVD. I remember
    the scene but don&#39;t remember the font.

  body: I seem to remember it being either Copperplate Gothic or Engraver&#39;s Gothic,
    but I haven&#39;t seen the movie in a while, so that&#39;s pretty much just a
    guess. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Thanks, I think I found the font that closely matches. <BR> <BR>QUESTION -
    If this particluar font is not offered by an engraver, can I purchase it online
    &#40;ex. Fonts.com&#41; and then have the engraver use that? Is that possible?

  body: A little late to the party, but what the hell. Here are the screengrabs. It&#39;s
    a beautiful calling card. I included the second shot so you could see the type
    was embossed. I thought it best to include the entire 2.35:1 frame, so sorry about
    the width. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63681.jpg"

  body: I wonder why they went with an emboss for the movie, rather than just going
    with thermography? The expense of the emboss would see to outweigh the &#34;cool&#34;
    of seeing the name debossed on the back of the card as he flips it. <BR> <BR>I
    think it&#39;d be pretty fun to work as an art director for a film and create
    all those props. <BR> <BR>Of course, then I&#39;d be on the receiving end of critiques
    of some non-period typeface that accidently creeped in. Maybe it&#39;s better
    if I stay out of the movies.

  body: All, <BR> <BR>Thanks and especially for the screengrabs by James! I see you
    guys know your stuff and don&#39;t fool around. <BR> <BR>CORRECT TERMINOLOGY?
    <BR>The border is Blind Embossed while the name &#40;as James mentioned&#41; is
    Embossed. Is this correct? &#40;Yes, I am a novice&#41; <BR> <BR>PURCHASE LOCATION?
    <BR>1. Can something this straightforward be done with an online, highly reputable
    vendor? <BR>2. If not, can anybody recommend quality engravers in the NJ / NYC
    area that can produce this? <BR>&#40;the only place I&#39;ve been to so far has
    been Crane&#39;s, the retail stationery store&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again! <BR>
