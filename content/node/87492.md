  is extremely graphic, almost asian looking but is actually a roman font just highly
  stylized.\r\n\r\nI have found something I believe is NOT the original in the sample
  but very close - It is repeatedly referred to as \"Mindfields\" everywhere I look,
  as a version of it readily available online for download is very similar to a/\"the\"
  font on the 1999 Toto album cover artwork for the album of the same title. However,
  I believe this Mindfields font to be a dupe of a previous design created after the
  album art came out (and after the piece that is in my image sample was created),
  as the outlines in the Mindfields font are not good and some key characters are
  different even if only slightly. A reference to the Mindfields font here : http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=1086\r\n\r\nAny
  help locating the name of the original (if one exists), and who carries it, would
  be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBob\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Bob,\r\n\r\nI think the font you are looking for is <strong>Linear Konstruct</strong>
    (c) 1986/1991 by Max Kisman\r\n\r\nThere is a reference of it in Luc Devroye's
    \"Holland Fonts /[Max Kisman]\" page:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27282.html\r\n\r\n...and
    maybe there is still on sale in a package called FUSE 2:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.at/fontproductdetailc.php3?ns=1&sns=6&co=Freischalt-CDs&id=6008377\r\n(look
    at the page right for a small sample)\r\n\r\nLinear Kostruct has an extra line
    at the base of every capital, while the font you have found uses the same glyphs
    for both lowers & capitals.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n"
