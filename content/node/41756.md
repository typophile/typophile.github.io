    who's into jewelry. What I like is this: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/candybarlogo_4851.gif]\r\n\r\nBut

  body: The script face looks a bit like it is just a cheaply auto-traced vector version
    of something. It doesn't look very refined. You seem to have a lot of different
    fonts going on in the design. I'd try to unify it a bit, personally.

  body: Diamonds are sophisticated. Try using an elaborate typeface to exaggerate
    the delicate-ness and quality of diamonds through your type choice. Diamonds are
    a girl's best friend. I don't see how diamonds are sweet. they make you think
    of sweets/candy etc. Hmm...try trendy type.
