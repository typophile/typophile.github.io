body: "This time it's for good, alas: <strong>Coliseum Books</strong>, which had recently
  relocated to just across the street from Bryant Park in New York City, will close
  its doors for good this Sunday, January 7. I happened to pass by last weekend, and
  they have some pretty big discounts on everything. Plenty of design and typography
  titles still left, folks (along with fiction, non-fiction, etc.). Get 'em while
  you can.\r\n\r\nMore info <a href=\"http://www.coliseumbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

  body: Yeah, it's sad. But I used to frequent their old Columbus Circle location,
    haven't even been there since they moved to 42nd street.
