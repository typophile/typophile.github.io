body: Hello, I am a print designer, but have a video/film project coming up that I
  have to design/produce. I am familiar and love typography for print, but would anyone
  be kind enough to recommend some fonts &#40;serif, slab and san&#41; for both titles
  and credits? I am very grateful. Thanks in advance. Tips would be welcome as well

  I suppose kerning is much harder in film to judge by resolution.
