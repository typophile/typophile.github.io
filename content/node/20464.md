    prominently - on the right instead of the left. On a small monitor they'd get

    resolution. 11 validation errors. No doctype.  Big ? for me. Subnavigation is
    lost completely on Studio Projects on most monitors. \r\n\r\nOh well.  I've never
    really been a big emigre fan so this really just adds to my perception of emigre
    as a place with half-functional products. "

    .)\r\n\r\nYeah, this is an improvement.\r\n\r\nAs for the criticism about 1024
    x 768. That may be the current web standard, but why limit it to a web standard
    when the audience (designers) very likely have much higher resolutions to work
    with. \r\n"

    I was always able to find anything I needed from the \"old\" homepage. I realize
    it will take getting used to, and after that I won't notice a thing, but it seems
    to me they've taken a few steps backward. \r\n\r\nThe Oracle homepage hierarchy
    (I assume you are talking about the right hand bar) isn't that different from
    what Emigre had before. \r\n\r\n(Don't shoot me, I'm just curious.)"

  body: "The new site may have introduced hierachy by reducing the # of links but
    god save you if the this new site was an airport. You have to lean a whole new
    unorthodox UI structure! And the new UI is really deemphasized. The old site would
    'get you to a plane on time' as it were. \r\n\r\nThat the old site was almost
    all UI was probably a flaw in the sense that it didn't keep you interested - not
    enough mystery/curiousity in the flat UI structure. That probably wasn't good
    for business.\r\n\r\nNeither solution strikes me as very user centered. But then
    being 'easy' hasn't really been their 'gig' has it?"

    my point. Besides the fact the site does not fit in my monitor (17\" Apple Display),
    the old one, like it or not, was a pioneering masterpiece in terms of design and
    usability. I was a little tired by it, but I enjoyed it immensely, as it was launched
    shortly after Emigre released my own Ottomat.\r\n\r\nI think they should have
    kept its efficiency, just with a new design.\r\nWho recalls the Now Serving BBS?

    big, proud displays of their typefaces is a good thing. having said that, anyone
    who does web design will cringe at the code and the lack of concern for usability
