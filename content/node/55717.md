  of fontlab), forgive if this has been covered. \r\n\r\nI am looking to add an opentype
  substitute feature into a font i have begun building. My intent is to have three
  versions of each character that will cycle as to appear randomly. That being said,
  my question is threefold.\r\n\r\n1- In fontlab's glyph window, where do i create
  the alternate characters, and what would be a typical naming convention?\r\n\r\n2-
  Would it be easier, code-wise, to randomize each character? or to create alt_set1,
  alt_set2, and alt_set3?\r\n\r\n3- what would be the best way to set up the glyph
  classes to achieve this result?\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense..\r\nThank you for
  any and all input!\r\nJohio"

    aalt, or other means? I have been attempting to find script examples with little
    luck. Any additional information on the subject would be amazing. Links, tutorials
    or the like.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n"

    calt {\r\nlookup rotate {\r\n  sub @default @default' by @alt1;\r\n  sub @alt1
    @default' by @alt2;\r\n} rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://silasdilworth.com/\">Silas
    Dilworth</a> and I recently released <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/font/blackmonday\">Black
    Monday, a font that cycles through three glyph sets.</a> It turned out that while
    CALT is nice, it is not widely implemented. Making matters worse, it\u2019s not
    always on by default. And it\u2019s flaky\u2014for example, in Indesign long strings
    of nonstop CALTs occasionally result in CALT turning off (although for display
    faces this won\u2019t usually be an issue). Silas dealt with this by writing a
    program that generates a massive list of LIGA ligatures to handle the cycling;
    it works very well. \r\n\r\nWould the mods please make a sticky out of one of
    the older, in-depth posts?"

  body: "great info James, thanks for the time!\r\n\r\nBlack Monday is a great example
    of the functionality i am looking for. Nice looking as well!\r\n\r\nOne of several
    remaining questions is a total novice one. When I define the glyph classes, i.e.
    @alt1. what form does this take in the code? \r\n\r\nwould it be something like:\r\n\r\n@alt1
    = [a.alt1 - z.alt2]\r\n\r\nwhich would be followed by something simple like the
    above calt feature??\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help.\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n"

    CALT, the contextual alternates feature would occasionally shut off and need to
    enabled by the user. I should probably put some examples together and submit a
    bug report. \r\n\r\nAnd the mods have stickied the old post that explains the
    CALT rotation stuff, it is at the top of the build forum."
