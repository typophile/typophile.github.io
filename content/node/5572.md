body: Mr. Porchez, it seems that something terrible has happend at Ensad, at least
  from what I could decipher from your website. I can&#39;t speak any French, and
  as you wrote, the Babelfish translation is not so good this time. Can we get a scoop
  over here at Typophile?

    target="_blank">www.porchez.com</a>, first post&#41;. At the very least, it sounds
    like he will no longer be teaching there, which sounds terrible enough! What I
    couldn&#39;t understand from the translation was whether type design or even typography
    will be discontinued from the curriculum as well.

    article in English</a> this time who explain more what happen. Dan, thanks for
    it. Hum, I discovered this thread via my referers. Its really nastly situation,
    who seems more related to politics and influences than the job done with the students
    who seems well received &#40;by the students and outside&#41;. Well, the life
    don&#39;t stop there, there is many things to do despite theses people at Ensad
    don&#39;t get the worldwide interest in typography who is now far behind the basic
    Swiss style that they seems to relay on. <BR> <BR>The best to do, is to put couple
    of words about your feelings on <a href="http://www.porchez.com/ensadtypo/145"
    target="_blank">that original page</a> English or French. <BR> <BR>thanks again.
