  'Mr Porter' logotype. I'm aware that the studio 'Saturday' had a lot to do with
  their re-brand, and know that the script font also used on the website was designed
  for them exclusively. Is the sans-serif in question the same, or is it an available
  typeface.\r\nIt would also be great to hear some suggestions of which other typefaces
  are similar...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mrporter.com/\r\n\r\nthanks in advance"

    makes it difficult to be sure,\r\nit looks like Eyechart Bold\r\n\r\nA similar
    one (not so strong) is: Eyeglass Bold\r\n\r\nI found it using \"Find my Font\"

  body: Eyechart Bold is very similar (rip-off?) to Engravers Gothic. Part of the
    thickess, MR PORTER woodmark is very close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/engravers-gothic/|Engravers
    Gothic]], something in between regular and bold weight (some kind of semibold).
    Could be Engravers Gothic (regular) artificially thickened with an outline stroke...
