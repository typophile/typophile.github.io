body: I exported as an eps from InDesign CS and  <BR>got this little surprise when
  I opened it up <BR>in Illustrator CS to check. The font is Minion <BR>Pro which
  seems to have gone completely <BR>out of whack! Notice that the small caps  <BR>have
  been replaced and figures changed. <BR>I exported with a postscript level 2 and
  data <BR>format as ASCII. Have I made a stupid or am <BR>I in the right?  <BR> <BR>
