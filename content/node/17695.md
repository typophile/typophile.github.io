body: I know Quark and Indesign are used for publication design. But are their any
  other programs used in newspaper design? I recently read in a blog (Newsdesigner.com)
  that if someone use InDesign to design an entire newspaper you would have the Sunday
  Times on Thursday evening. Are there other pagination programs out there?
