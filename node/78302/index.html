		<div class="commentbody">Ye Gods, this isn&rsquo;t Crowdspring surely? I am new to forum, Have read posts regarding &lsquo;logo for eCommerce platform&rsquo; with interest, wondering whether this the first time this sort of misuse of generosity and transgression of sensitive unwritten code has occurred?  To &lsquo;Canada Glulam&rsquo;: make a thoughtful choice and hire a designer, let them create a brief with you, pay them and treat them as professionals. Design is not blind, arbitrary twiddling type and so forth, no one knows a thing about your company and how to intelligently project that to say the VERY least. To me this is insulting. I am sure you do not mean to be though, and especially because of that, God help us.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Wayne,</p>
<p>Most of the people here are professionals and will find your post insulting, as we see from the previous poster. In my opinion, based on what you have written; you need to approach a local Educational Institution which offers design studies and put forward your brief to their students. In this way you will receive your free logo and the students more or less will be happy to work for you, because they are getting a chance to show off their skills to an outsider, plus they will have a work to put in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Good luck,
SB</p>
<p>P.s. sometimes education and books can come in handy whenever assistance is needed.</p>

<p>I also encourage &ldquo;Canada Glulam&rdquo; to spend some time considering how they might react to a proposal for a project with ZERO guarantee of ANY compensation. Is that how you run your manufacturing company? You research, design and produce a product, and do so while knowing your client has solicited thousands of other manufacturing companies to do the exact same project? You invest your time, resources, materials, and expertise to complete the project.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;your&rdquo; client picks only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> manufacturing company to pay, and the other thousands of companies get nothing - except stuck with a useless product. They can&rsquo;t even sell it themselves, because it&rsquo;s specifically designed for the client and it&rsquo;d be legal infringement to sell it. Sound like a good way to make a living?</p>
<p>And worse&mdash;what would happen to the manufacturing industry if they all had to survive in this system?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To me the most worrying issue isn&rsquo;t about the fee, it&rsquo;s about how the work of a designer is misunderstood and design trivialised. The fact that Canada Glulam could post such a request on this forum without embarrassment shows that we have a vast problem of how what we do is perceived and valued. Most of us would feel we are so well outside the realm of Crowdspring and similar sites we can ignore the phenomenon but they are having an insidious impact and are redefining and solidifying what we do as light weight and low status. As are those crass and laughable sites where &lsquo;off the peg&rsquo; logos can be chosen like Build-A-Bear. We might dismiss all this as beneath our concentration but I was at a branding conference recently where the presentation of one of those sites (and it&rsquo;s £10 price tag) was greeted with extraordinary excitement and rapturous applause by professionals who would be horrified to apply such standards to their own fields. Can&rsquo;t help feel it is our fault if design is held in such slight regard and it makes us very vulnerable now. There has always been hack, ignorant work of course but computer technology is giving it a spurious respectability and power to overwhelm and control and as anyone has the means of production, anyone is a designer and we are diluted into oblivion! The responsibility lies with us to change this and establish the high ground. Everything is in flux. Now or never I rather think.</div>

<p>I find the problem to be that our audience is ignorant (clients).</p>
<p>I recently printed a banner for a guy. He got to the framer and came back to ask us why his logo (which looked so nice on his business card) looked so bad at large sizes. I calmly explained that we were not at fault&ndash;some idiot decided to livetrace the most simple of compass designs and not even worry that it couldn&rsquo;t become any bigger without being noticeable.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that the compass can be found in Zapf Dingbats, outlined, and voila! Some guy managed to find a picture on the web, I&rsquo;m presuming, and livetrace it. Which is sooo much more work than it required.</p>
<p>I offered to give him a perfect logo for payment of 1 hour&ndash;but he&rsquo;s got his &ldquo;logo guy&rdquo; working on it.</p>
<p>Indeed, God help us help them.</p>

<p>I agree, but the misunderstandings typically come from people who&rsquo;ve never hired a professional designer before, so it&rsquo;s understandable that they don&rsquo;t understand the profession and have no idea what things cost. When working with them designers need to educate them. Corporate clients, on the other hand, typically have worked with designers before and understand what typical fees are.</p>
