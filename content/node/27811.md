  decision making process.\r\nI happen to need the text book italic k in a fairly
  large size, and noticed, that it seems to have a little problem with it. There seems
  to be a drawing mistake in the right leg of the k. All the other ks are ok, as you
  can see.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do about this? is this very common? I don't own FL, so
  I can't fix it permanently myself, only one-offs in Illustrator. "

  body: Have you contacted the designer, <a href="http://www.joshuadarden.com/">Joshua
    Darden</a>? That seems to me the obvious thing to do in this case. There is an
    apparent bug in the font, which he will surely want to know about and fix, and
    he will be able to provide you with an updated font file. He may, of course, want
    to confirm that you have a legitimate license, but it sounds like you do and it
    should be easy to confirm.

  body: "Hello:\r\n\r\nThis bug (incorrect artwork for 'k' in FreightText-BookItalic
    and FreightText-BoldItalic) was identified shortly after the release of Freight,
    and new versions were generated. Evidently, some distributors have implemented
    the update less swiftly than others.\r\n\r\nI've responded to Mili directly on
    this, but if anyone else should encounter the same problem, I would like to hear
    about it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.joshuadarden.com/contact/\r\n\r\n"

    in my files is now fixed and the font is working beautifully!\r\nIt's a shame
    that you have to be bothered about this even though you've already fixed the bug."

    \"nice font\".\r\nIt was FreightSans book, which I use for my company's correspondance
    and stationary, spiced up with FreightText. I've enjoyed the font very much."
