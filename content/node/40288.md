  body: "It obviously works better in some places than in others. In the 'hugs' and
    'UoW' examples it looks great, less so in the other two.\r\n\r\nBy the way Jos
    can I ask what your commercial model is? Not that I have any complaints about
    your giving out fonts free:) It's great, but I'm just curious how it works.  "

  body: "I agree Arun, but I think vi.sualize.us also looks nice.\r\n\r\nMy commercial
    model... till recently I had none. I worked full time as an art director and type
    was (just) a hobby and I was happy to be able to cover my expenses with the donation
    I got/get. \r\n\r\nBecause I've become well known as 'free quality font foundry'
    and because my site traffic has grown exponentially (nearly one million pageviews
    and half a million visitors this year) I've decided to make a change this year.
    I now work a day less per week so I've an extra day for doing type. The first
    (partial) commercial font I'll release will be [[http://exljbris.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/museo|MUSEO]].
    I'll sell the 100 and 900 weight for a small amount and the other three weights
    will be free. I've no idea how it will work out, but I'm counting on my numbers
    :-)"

    now that I look at it again, yes. It's the Arial next to it that spoils it a bit
    :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My commercial model...\"\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing that. I'm sure
    Museo would be a resounding success and enable you to keep working the way you
    currently are. "
