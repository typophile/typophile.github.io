  similar to bronzino.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/bronzino/\r\n\r\nbut bronzino
  was designed in 2010 and the statue is 50-60 years old, so i search for the \"real\"
  font... :D"

  body: "If it's on a statue and it's 50-60 years old, it's hand-cut and not a font.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, T.M. Cleland's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/della-robbia/|Della
    Robbia]] (1902) may have been the inspiration for the inscription you saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and Crafts movement, which predates your statue by forty or more years...
