  body: '&#40;Hastily&#41;    <BR>This is the Hellenic National [Language] Corpus,
    hosted by the Institute of Language and Speech Processing &#40;&#60;<a href="http://www.ilsp.gr"
    target="_blank">http://www.ilsp.gr</a>&#62; -- the site also in English&#41;.   <BR>Thr
    blurb says: &#39;Thr corpus of texts at the ILSP has been develope over a number
    of years and now encompasses more than 32 million words, which arebeing added
    to regularly. The user has the option of retrieving one of the sentences in the
    corpus using from one to three words, or lemmata or grammatical constructions.
    In addition the user can determine the maximum distance between required words,
    as well as the subset of texts to which the search is limited. Lastly, there are
    some statistical data available on the linguistic content of the corpus, as well
    as the potential to return tables with [paraemeters] for a word defined by the
    user.&#39;   <BR>I gave it a spin, and quickly selected:   <BR>Magazines/Information/Arts/Books&#43;Letters/   <BR>Was
    then faced with a selection from two of the major periodocal pubslishers, a list
    of authors, and a string of dates &#40;Feb 93 to Dec 99&#41;. Hit OK,  got a confirmation
    of my selections, and was then faced with a series of webforms for selecting up
    to three words, with grammatical qualifications. did that, but their database
    spits out non-Unicode text &#40;aaaaaarrggh!&#41; so got gibberish.    <BR>&#60;<a
    href="http://hnc.ilsp.gr/statistics.asp" target="_blank">http://hnc.ilsp.gr/statistics.asp</a>&#62;
    has some interesting stats: most frequent words and lemmata, plus the possibility
    to return a frequency for any string you provide &#40;within the corpus, of course&#41;.    <BR>I
    cannot tell you off the cuff how representative of a wider body of written work
    this corpus is, but the fact that the three most frequent words are the masculine
    article, the word &#39;me&#39; and the word &#39;mine&#39;, there might be some
    bias due to the sample &#40;newspapers, high circulation books, etc.&#41;.   <BR>There
    seems to be a lot of stuff there, but the non-Unicode output and the lack of an
    English version limits its functionality.    <BR>G/'

  body: This is a random question, possibly for the greek speakers out there &#40;hence
    this thread&#41;, I&#39;m doing a logo for a motorboat racing team and the name
    of the team/boat is Moneikos. I haven&#39;t found any web dictionay that will
    translate it. I have found other boats named moneikos though. <BR> <BR>a. Is it
    greek? <BR>b. What&#39;s it mean? <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR>Randy

    target="_blank">http://hnc.ilsp.gr/statistics.asp</a> <BR> <BR>Bingo. <BR>I guess
    the first section has the top 100 and 1000 lists of words, and allows for custom
    searching. And I guess the next set is for lemmas - but what&#39;s a lemma? And
    at the bottom, I guess it allows for the searching of phrases - but what&#39;s
    the difference between those two large fields? <BR> <BR>In case anybody&#39;s
    wondering, I need this stuff because I&#39;m about to design my first &#40;original&#41;
    Greek face, and I need to know what the language is doing first. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    the fact that the three most frequent words .... <BR> <BR>Good observation. It
    reminds me of the major difference I once found in English word frequencies between
    adult versus children&#39;s material. In the latter &#34;you&#34; is the 8th word,
    but it&#39;s 33rd in the former. Otherwise they&#39;re surprisingly close. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; the non-Unicode output and the lack of an English version limits its
    functionality.  <BR> <BR>Yes. <BR>BTW, are there any automated online Greek-to-English
    dictionaries? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; Moneikos <BR> <BR>Maybe it means &#34;Monaco&#34;?
    Yaght central, baby. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    thing that the &#39;language is doing&#39; that might not be evident from online
    sources is reverting to polytonic &#40;in orthography, not pronunciation&#41;.
    There is an increasing demand for polytonic Greek fonts within Greece, to the
    degree that major software developers are being told &#39;Don&#39;t bother shipping
    anything to Greece unless it supports polytonic&#39;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently
    developing a set of Greek kerning documents based on the Septuagint and NT. I&#39;ll
    make these available, as FontLab kerning lists, once they&#39;re ready.

    the last 20-25 years. Everybody &#40;take this literally&#41; can read polytonic
    perfectly well; spelling competence varies &#40;but then again so do polytonic
    orthography, depending on period of source, rogour of transcription, and editorial
    style&#41;. apart from any work from antiquity to 1982, all texts by self-respecting

    continued use. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll just put on record my view that both systems
