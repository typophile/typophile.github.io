  them to fontlab, I just asked myself: Is there a way to handle tangents of the curves
  in illustrator in a way similar to Fontlab?\r\nIn Fontlab, I can klick on a tangent
  handle, then moving it with the cursor keys, having very detailed control (sometimes
  I even count the steps I move a handle, to reach symmetry, similarity to other glyphs,
  etc.)\r\nIn Illustrator, it seems the only way is to drag the handle with the mouse,
  so there is no \"numeric control\" over the handle. There *is* control for points
  on the curve, you can select them and move them by mouse or keyboard.\r\n\r\nAs
  I use Illustrator as a ... well, illustration tool as well, I'd often wish that
  I could control the handles in a similar way to fontlab.\r\nSo how do those who
  draw their glyphs in Illustrator do the detailed systematic fiddle work on their
  curves? Intuition? A good eye? A secret Illustrator mode I do not know yet?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSebastian"

  body: "Their is a plug-in called 'Better Handles' http://www.nineblock.com/products.html
    that allows much more advanced control of handles and I believe will work similar
    to the precision allowed in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nI preferred Illustrator to draw characters
    until I realized the subtle distortion and extra time it created in drawing glyphs.
    \r\n\r\nThe other problem is that if you follow Fontlab's guide to drawing characters
    in Illustrator with the grid set to match Fontlab's whole point integer's, you
    end up working at such a scale in Illustrator that there isn't much room to work
    with more than a few characters without running off the pasteboard, requiring
    the use of layers or separate Illustrator files.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier and
    efficient to work in Fontlab and use Illustrator occasionally for select elements
    to assist in the process."
