  the name of the font used on this cover:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.writersdigestshop.com/catalog/product/gallery/id/73779/image/41167/\r\n\r\nIt's
  repeated in the inner material for chapter headings as well, only it's slightly
  different. The font is essentially the same, only the capital A doesn't have a serif
  on top, whereas there is clearly a serif on the capital A on the book's front title.
  Is that a different font, or simply a variation of the same font?\r\n\r\nIf you
  click on the \"Look Inside\" link on Amazon.com, you'll see what I mean.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Writing-21st-Century-Fiction-Storytelling/dp/1599634007\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteve"
