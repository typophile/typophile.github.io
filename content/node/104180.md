body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cangaceiro_5663.png]\r\n\r\nHello! Can
  you help me?\r\nDoes anyone know what font is this? It's used in the 1952 brazilian
  movie poster for O Cangaceiro. The film was awarded at Cannes, being very famous
  at that time. I have been looking for a while at some similar fonts, but none of
  them have an A or an E like those. I appreciate your attention.  May be silly but
  it's very important for my graduation research and I am not an expert in typography.
  Thank you very much!"
