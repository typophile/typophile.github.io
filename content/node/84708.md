body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nJust interested to know if anyone here has experience with licencing/legal
  knowledge of your artwork.\r\n\r\nTake for example a client comes to me and says
  they want their own name created from the ground up (the letters custom created
  etc).\r\n\r\nObviosuly I would charge a normal graphic design rate or agreed price
  or by the hour etc for that service and I supply them with a illustor file containing
  the graphic which they can use for their website or as stickers on there motorbike,
  business cards etc or something like I thought would be intended.\r\n\r\nBut say
  one day they become world famous and that custom lettering I created becomes a major
  part of their identity and then they start selling, tshirts, flags, cups / merchandise
  with the use of that custom lettering I made.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day does
  it come back to me and using my own business knowledge to be sure to set out in
  a Terms and Conditions document etc, that when first creating the artwork we agree
  in that document that they don't have full ownership of my design when I first create
  it??? And that I must be renumerated appropriatley if they are selling the creation
  as merchandise etc???\r\n\r\nI haven't run into this situation yet but was just
  thinking how some of the world famous athletes and there original designers come
  to an agreement. (for example there are some world famous motorsport people who
  have run the same original number and style their entire careers and have sold merchandise
  with that original design throughout their careers, be interested to know if the
  original designer gets a little slice on each item sold, or if in the first place
  the athlete/manager paid a lump sum fee for total ownership and control originally.)\r\n\r\nI
  have heard that Michael Bay gets a little slice of every Movie Transformer figure
  that is sold, and know about the Nike swoosh logo story. \r\n\r\nAny ideas, knowledge
  would be great"
