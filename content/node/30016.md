body: 'I want to import and side bearings from a base font, and apply those bearings
  to a variant version. I tried generating the font as PS1 and then used the file/import/metrics
  path to import an afm and apply it. But it doesn''t seem to change side bearings
  to those of the base font. What am I doing wrong?  '

    work for me. \r\n\r\nThe 'paste special' gave me a warning that it would strip
    open type features, but they still seem to be OK. "

  body: 'Yes, David, the ''paste special'' worked, as Alesandro and Chris wrote. But
    the ''import metrics'' didn''t work for me. So I don''t need it now, but something
    is amiss in either the operation or the way I used it.  '
