body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am wondering if anyone out there has experience using
  fonts from Parahcute's DIN series. I am unfamiliar with the foundry and would like
  to set my C.V. for a design professorship using DIN Display, mainly, but may jump
  over to their DIN Text if DIN Display doesn't work out at lower sizes as they claim
  it will. Before I lay down the Euros, I'd love to know how well these fonts behave.
  Are they well-spaced and well-kerned?"

  body: I do not own Din Display but have the specimen PDF which seems to work quite
    will over a variety of sizes. It is a nice Din with a very good feel.
