  need to create a design that fulfills several criteria. \r\n\r\nIt has to have a
  slightly 'British' feel - ie: no German Blackletter or Nazi overtones :) - and also
  a strong military feel.\r\n\r\nApart from the obvious choices of Gill (used in many,
  many WW2 British information leaflets), the various Gothic typefaces and Stencil
  (for that authentic 'MASH' look LOL), can anyone recommend any good alternatives?\r\n\r\nA
  headline / copy combination would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: You could try any packaging for WW2 shooters  ( video games ) a few of these
    seem to get the feel down right. Medal of Honor, Call of Duty etc... Just a thought.

  body: "One other thought - there are people who make exact replica model aircraft,
    boats and such out of matchboxes and lolly sticks. These chaps have fonts that
    accurately depict the lettering used by the RAF and Royal Navy - might be worth
    checking. \r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to find copies of British newspapers of
    the era and blag the typography from these.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si  "

    so I believe your advice is OK.   Me, I prefer nuking demons, evil aliens and
    bots (Doom III, Halo II, and now Darkwatch).\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I nuke in style!"

    - british / french and german 3D models for army, air and navy..   wwiionline.com
    - which is an online virtual battlefield players get to operate in a very realistic
    simulation..  and they strive to reproduce as authentic detail as possible for
    every portion of each military.\r\n \r\nI am looking for information regarding
    the typographic fonts used by the british army at the moment.. for printed material,
    or vehicle markings - email me anytime with any related info please."
