  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Everybody, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a logo I'm working on for a technology company which primary focus was the oil industry, hence the name Rockoil (petroleum). Now they don't want to be exclusively associated with the oil industry anymore, as the technological solutions they provide can serve to many other clients. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The company actually represents 2 other big international companies, which fields are satellite-positioning systems, and &quot;clean&quot; technologies for industrial cycles (water purifying systems, etc.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comments would be much appreciated! :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rafael Iskin<!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aloha Rafael! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If they want to downplay the oil association, I would decrease the size of the type in relation to the mark and reposition the mark to the left so it is the first read. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The mark has a fresh, clean look that goes well with &quot;clean&quot; technologies, and the blue/green color scheme seems to make an association for GPS. Well done. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I may catch some flack for this here, but I think a dark gray would go better with the mark than the black type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here goes the dark gray version, I really like it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And you are right about the card Scott, I posted an old (and wrong) version of it, despite the trimming problem the type on the bottom is disturbing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to the &quot;Oil&quot; problem Bernard, well, if they didn't want *any* association with it they would have to change the company's name.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't like the R. Maybe just because it reminds of the cheap Bitstream-Revue-typeface.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The circle in the logo also strikes me as odd, mimicking the O-form, not really a circle at all, and the O has nothing to do with their name or anything else, so that confuses me quite a bit. Also, the logo in itself looks a bit generic, I more or less associate it with a crosshair of a weapon system, and that, indeed, is not a good ind of visual metaphor for a company. And in some weird way it also reminds me of the (otherwise quite nice) newish BP-sun (maybe due to the green), which doesn't help establish an individual identiy at all. I don't see oil, I don't see water, I don't see information in all of this. And if you cannot see it&hellip; why opt for a ideographic trademark at all? I the  and &lt;&gt; 's don't make any sense and are just visual special effects, just leave them away and concentrate on the word rockoil itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the technical side, the logo probably won't work in black and white and even in colour, it will take three, probably even four colours to print/plot that artwork, which is not quite the most economic solution available.</div>

People have different tastes, and as you are not criticizing the construction or anything objective about the letter there is nothing I can say except &quot;I like it&quot;. I have found a Linotype-Revue, I don't like it too, but I don't see any resemblance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, the mark *is* a bit generic, and the main reason is because the company acts in many different fields (I don't want to say water, or oil) it is an abstract concept, and BTW I don't see *any* trouble in using purely abstract ideograms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you don't see any association in the mark, I think you are not even trying to put yourself in the position of the target public of the logo. The crosshairs are not exclusively used in weapon systems, but in *any* positioning system, as they denote direction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example:  in the controls that position oil platforms above the hole they want to drill. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, to me the mark have a positive association in the other field the company operates; as it can be read as a &quot;green&quot; focus over a industrial cycle. Have you ever noticed that the pictogram for &quot;cycle&quot; often is not a perfect circle, but a more squashed one? look at some washing machines for example) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to the technical side, it has been considered, and there is no problem in using 4 colors. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, when you design something is crucial to take in account the uses it will have, but that's exactly why it is nonsense to limit yourself to constraints that don't apply to you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any case I'm posting different versions of the logo, one for good quality 1 color printing, and the other to coarse low quality 1 color printing  (like old fax machines). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, that's it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lucky me you are not my client HD  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should disagree with HD - the font is pretty good for that type of logo. And I should agree with HD on another point - 4 colours are too much for a logo. And I doubt that you will be able to reproduce this via the standard CMYK process - you will surely need a Pantone solution.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Kris and Ivan, thanks for the feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm really surprised with this resemblance you guys see with the BP logo, the only connection I can see is the use of green and a certain &quot;concentric&quot; construction. Could you possibly elaborate a bit more about this? I would be really interested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frankly, there aren't so many different color schemes as there are companies (in any field), and I'm sure I can find a logo already using any (good) color combination. If I had used the colors of a competitor I would have committed a major flaw, but that's not really the case. (I will explain a bit more about the nature of the company at the end) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please have in mind that I've never heard of those companies before (BP or OMV) as we don't have them around here; but I'm actually glad to see they use a similar color scheme as mine; because I'm sure they have used (expensive) research to determine their colors, while I had to just trust my guts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About &quot;technological solution&quot;</div>
