  called \"Loupe\".  It's nearing completion so I've started playing with a few ideas
  for a logo.\r\n\r\nIt's based on the shape of a photographer's loupe and I'm aiming
  for a professional look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loupe 500px_6706.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nany
  feedback or ideas?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nPaul"

    between two parts of the mark looks strange; I'd rather keep the mark either fully
    3D or 2D. The text needs to be kerned, but I guess you are not at this stage yet.
    Also the choice of type is a \"Web 2.0\" cliche, though depending on your marketing
    strategy you may actually need that.\r\n\r\nThe overall impression of the logo
    is quite good though. It looks decent and it is memorable. Just needs few tweaks
    IMO."
