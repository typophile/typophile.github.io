  body: "#2 is the best of the second round \u2014 but overall it feels like it's
    trying too hard to be trendy and 'design' minded. They all look like they're cobbled
    together from free fonts which makes it look like a knockoff brand."

  body: "If you're lost I'd say go to a sketchbook (or AI file) and just start playing.
    Don't preoccupy yourself with what you think this <em>has</em> to be. Try to come
    up with a solid concept behind the logotype (or perhaps mark as well). Look at
    design blogs, look at other people's portfolios, look at the work of famous design
    firms and figure out what it is that makes their work successful; do whatever
    it takes for you to be inspired. \r\n\r\nOne thing I'm finding I constantly dislike
    about the logotypes you're showing is that they're all made with a typeface that
    has something gimmicky about it; something that will most likely date the work
    within a few months. "
