  body: Why is this labelled "fail"? This clearly is an intentional joke, an not a
    half-bad one either.

    not a half-bad one either.\r\n\r\nThis is true. However, the labelling of \"FAIL\"
    is an attempt to go along with the joke; it is expected not only of the viewer
    to recognize the sign as an intentional joke, but the labelling of the photograph
    as a joke as well.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"dead-pan\" (with \"pan\" being a slang
    term for the face or the expression) humor."
