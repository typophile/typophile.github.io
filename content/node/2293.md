    from a fellow Reading Grad! Did you just finish then? Are you going to ATypI?
    <BR> <BR>I disagree with Milan. I see more of a meta-esqueness in it. I also think
    the eversoslight stroke modulation is very nice. Will you make more weights? It
    made me smile to see an extrabold. Seems like most people put this off until they&#39;ve
    finished all the other weights. I&#39;m downloading the PDF so I&#39;ll have to
    read this before I can make more comments. <BR> <BR> <BR>Tiffany '

  body: I haven&#39;t looked at the PDF yet, but from the Flash views I&#39;d say
    it&#39;s a nice, solid humanist sans. The problem is we have so many of those
    now, it&#39;s hard to appreciate! :-/ The good news is that your flares &#40;although
    I don&#39;t see how they might promote &#34;clarity of reading from a distance&#34;&#41;
    do give the design some subtle originality. And the Heavy has a nice presence.
    <BR> <BR>For signage I presume this needs to be conservative, but for the retail
    market you might consider putting some funkiness in it, somehow. A good example
    of what I&#39;m talking about is FF Profile. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    at Reading. He&#39;s an excellent calligrapher, and his type really shows. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m afraid the text version of Arrival still won&#39;t be very funky.
    It will be a good serviceable humanist sans &#40;yet another, I know.&#41;. Quirkiness
    will come later with my DG Sans... even more calligraphic &#40;a sans version
    of Albertus?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll definitely try to go to TypeCon this year...

    is too wide. A bit narrower and it could be the perfect greek counterpart to the
    recent Skia. Do you know if Cadmus has a digital version or if Carter is intentioned
    to work again on Skia. Is Skia still a property of Apple? <BR> <BR>What do you
    mean by &#34;culturally degenerative designs&#34;? Something like bastard and
    dull roman fonts designed on the wave of advertising urge from the 1960s onwards
    we have for latin?

    the fact that yours works. I think this is one character that usually looks frumpy
    and out of place in other sans types that are trying to maintain constraint. The
    dot over the i and j, only looked big on my monitor and the remark was supposed
    to be tongue in cheek, but instead it came across more foot in mouth. Very <i>very</i>

  body: 'Re. Cadmus: I agree that it is generally better than the heavily Latinised
    old Helvetica Greek, Baskerville, etc., but I still wouldn&#39;t describe it as
    authentically Greek. It is really a kind of &#39;what if?&#39; historical fantasy,
    in which Matthew applies the fairly rigid geometry of early Attic inscriptions
    to a lowercase alphabet that did not exist at the time. It&#39;s interesting and
    in some respects successful &#40;it doesn&#39;t suffer from the deadness and lack
    of rhythm of the Helvetica&#41;, but it is no more authentically Greek than the
    other types of this period. The straight <i>lambda,</i> the symetrical <i>chi</i>
    and <i>gamma</i>; the lack of descenders on <i>beta</i>, <i>zeta</i> and <i>ksi</i>;
    the monodirectional ascender on the <i>delta</i>: none of these are any more authentic
    to Greek than the serifs on the Baskerville. Perhaps Cadmus just seems more Greek
    because it is less obviously Latin? <BR> <BR>Anyway, sorry for the digression.
