  a display gothic from an old Speedball lettering book. I may try to tighten it up
  without as close a regard for the reference someday, but it's on the back burner
  for now.\r\n\r\nI've recently posted some new samples for [[http://typophile.com/node/41105|Agamemnon]]
  as well. Go on, have a look!\r\n"

  body: "Your Finnish text for Posterony is incorrect: add an 'n' after 'h\xE4'. Overall
    feel of both texts is that they are very heavy, with a lot of contrast between
    thin and heavy strokes."

  body: Thanks for pointing it out, but I had never assumed any of my sample text
    was correct in any language. I use a program called [[http://www.fika.org/davew/judebear/MacLorem/|MacLorem]]
    to generate dummy text that is more varied than the usual Cicero passage. I had
    thought the Finnish option (and all the options, for that matter) only generated
    blocks with a pattern resembling typical letter frequencies rather than a specific
    text. I guess I should be more careful on how I use that thing.
