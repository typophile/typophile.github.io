body: I am beginning a web site project for a lady who sells realty. I have decided
  to use simply her name with a nice serif font for the logo. Any ideas on some fonts
  that might work well? Should I go with more of a san serif? Thank You!

    <BR>I don&#39;t know how about the font, Mr. Shaun Pansolli , <BR>Since we live
    in buildings and our ideas in the letters, <BR>I guess there are several ways
    to approach that business, <BR>as there are many foundries.

    has come through in my email app &#40;NS4.72&#41;, so I didn&#39;t have to go
