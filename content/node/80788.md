  you could recommend me a famous penmanship font which is strict and with the decorative
  little arrows.\r\nI would be very thankful.\r\n\r\n[[http://store.homeschoolfeast.com/merchant2/graphics/00000002/I12393.jpg]]\r\n\r\nBest

  body: "I am not sure what you are looking for. <a href=\"http://www.schoolhousefonts.com/Schoolhouse/samples.htm\">Schoolhouse
    Fonts</a> offers educational handwriting fonts in the American Cursive style (Zaner-Bloser
    and D\u2019Nealian). There are variants with guidelines and instructive (not decorative)
    arrows, indicating order and direction.\r\n\r\nA famous penmanship typeface, on
    the other hand, would be something like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-zaner/?refby=mfde\">P22
    Zaner Pro</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/compendium/\">Compendium</a>."
