body: "Hey Guys and Girls,\r\n\r\nI have an annoying problem. How do I import kerning
  from a text file into Fontlabs metric window?? I have tried various methods, but
  either I get only one line at a time, or I should up the arrow and select one line
  at a time!\r\nThere must be a way where I can see and test the full text?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!!\r\nMorten"

    of mouse clicking.

  body: As far as I know it will only display one line at a time in the text  area
    at top, though this often translates to several lines below. I think if you want
    to test paragraphs of text you will need to generate and print.
