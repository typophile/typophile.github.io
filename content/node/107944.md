  body: "Knowing Qantas, this is likely to be a custom font. It is a very close match
    for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/|Alternate Gothic
    No. 3]] in terms of character shapes, widths etc. \u2014 though Alternate Gothic
    is quite heavy and doesn't have the straight tail on the /Q/.\r\n\r\nQantas have
    rebranded recently. You may be interested in seeing their current corporate style
