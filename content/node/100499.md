    your 'red flag'? While you might be correct, posting unfounded/uncredited/unreinforced
    naked accusations reduces your credibility and that of this forum.

  body: "I'm sorry I don't usually take the time to elaborate - I hope people realize
    that these warnings are in good faith, and not elaborating doesn't make them unfounded,
    \"naked\" or anything like that. It's just about saving time. There's no reason
    to be so offensive - you're defending things that probably don't deserve it.\r\n\r\nBasically
    there are too many tell-tale signs. When I look at Castrique's fonts, some of
    them are strongly reminiscent of commercial fonts I've seen (I just don't know
    their names, I'm sorry to say). And the skill required to make certain aspects
    of his fonts don't come easily; you <em>hear</em> about people at that level*,
    plus they very rarely give their work away. Lastly, some of his fonts have glaringly
    horrible glyphs mixed in with highly accomplished ones - like the \"g\" in Qlassik.
    For people who make fonts (as opposed to just looking at them) it's really pretty
    obvious what's going on, sorry to say.\r\n\r\n* Or you can Google them.\r\n\r\nConsidering
    how good people like Ryuk, Dick and others are at IDing fonts, I'm sure the original*
    will turn up. If it doesn't, I hope that's not because of some unwritten rule
    that once a close-enough ID has been made, One Must Not Disclose A More Restrictive/Expensive
    Font...\r\n\r\n* Hopefully including the originals of Castrique's other designs,
    so we can establish a pattern, and exclude his fonts from future IDs.\r\n\r\nBTW
    what bothers me is that virtually nobody ever \"faces the music\" and admits that
    a given recommendation was a bad idea, no matter how clearly damning the evidence
    is. If this is some sort of battle against ethical behavior \"cramping the style\"
    of hedonistic IDing for its own sake, some people are only losing this battle
    against <em>themselves.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>That</strong> is what reduces the
    credibility of Typophile.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "We should confirm the proof before making the accusations. Just because one
    font looks like another is not sufficient to suggest fraud. \"Strongly reminiscent
    of commercial fonts\" is not enough proof.\r\n\r\nJust because one font is shown
    at Dafont and not at MyFonts should not be enough reason either. Many (Most) very
    competent designers freely give away their work such as \"demo\" fonts. \r\n\r\nIDers
    don't aim for free fonts. They look for fit.  Top priority for IDing fonts is
    Match not Price.  Second priority is to find valid source. The unwritten rule,
    which is heavily enforced, is not to link to underground font collections. We
    all won't identify a font if it's from known copyists or counterfeiters. We probably
    shouldn't give any names what with Google and all.\r\n\r\nWhether you like or
    don't like a character design is not enough reason to condemn a font. Somebody
    used it in a graphic design. It is somebody's child - albeit an ugly one.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there's an \"original font\" for every perturbation of a design, note
    the so-call \"glaringly horrible\" /g in Qlassk. It's easy to design something
    slightly different but we can't rightfully then say \"that's horrible\". \r\n\r\nOf
    course, font iding is not tasked with recommending fonts, it is to find the font
    being used. Whether a design is used commercially, or not, is never asked. We
    never say \"use this font for private purposes only\" and use this other one for
    commercial endeavors.  It is assumed that designers will use the answer honestly.\r\n\r\nReducing
    the credibility of Typophile is making accusations based on feelings not facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you derive so much pleasure IDing, and certainly not the people who struggle to
    make them. All you care about is getting credit for an ID, and quite often you
    end up closer to the problem than the solution.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We all won't

  body: "First, I have to agree on almost everything written by DPape above.\r\n\r\n@Hrant:
    I introduced to Typophile by a friend of mine which is a font designer. I know
    him for 25+ years and I fully understand and appreciate the effort required and
    the experience involved in the art of creating a good typeface. \r\nAlthough I'm
    with you on your overall spirit to protect this place from being \"just another
    ID site\" and protect also the rights of legitimate font designers, I don't agree
    with your ways of doing so and the intuitive way you define \"legitimacy\".\r\n\r\nYou
    can't just harass any people looking for an ID or ambush them by \"innocent looking
    questions\" and you can't also assume that any people providing an Id, value the
    joy of id-ing more than the work of legitimate font designers.\r\nYou have to
    admit (to yourself) that you seem to enjoy promoting your personal image as the
    \"Typophile Batman\".\r\n\r\n<strong>About Find my Font Online database</strong>:
    We are very careful on which fonts/sites we include and which are not, and this
    is under constant reconsideration on a font by font basis. We decided to <em>not</em>
    include any of well known copy/clone  foundries (Brendel, Arts & Letters, Softmaker)
    with the idea of \"err on the safe side\" although many of them officially sell
    their fonts e.g. on MyFonts.com. \r\nWe also decided to <em>not</em> include links
    to any site directly offering commercial font downloads but we do included free
    fonts from \"Dafont\" and \"Google Web Fonts\" considering that the ratio of (value
    offered) / (possible illegitimacy) is really big. Dafont.com contains at the moment
    about 20.000+ fonts and although many of them could be ugly, with wrong kerning,
    etc., I think only a small fraction are actual clones of commercial fonts and
    an even smaller percent involves actual outline theft.\r\n\r\nMore than that,
    if you go to any font page of findmyfont.com you can find a feedback tab which
    is designed with this sole purpose: To allow any visitor to report a font as illegitimate,
    plagiarized, etc and allows us to check and remove it from our online matching
    database. We have removed 10ths of fonts this way and put it on a \"black list\"
    to ensure that they will never go back to our database, but we need real evidence
    for this, not just \"I have a feeling that this font looks like a commercial font
    I saw somewhere\".\r\n\r\n<strong>About my Id's in Typophile and this specific
    font Id</strong>: \r\nWhen I first involved in Find my Font software development,
    I downloaded a lot of fonts from various internet sources and I combined them
    with our commercial font collections bought from Linotype, Adobe etc. in an effort
    to test the ability of the software to accurately handle a large number of fonts
    (this is a large private collection used only for testing purposes and it has
    nothing to do with our official online font database offered by Find my Font).\r\nEvery
    time I'm ready to post an answer here on a Typophile Id-request forum -especially
    if a matching font is not coming from a well known legitimate foundry- I run the
    font(s) found against this large private font collection. \r\nIf there are many
    matching fonts (under different names/foundries etc) I search the net for more
    info to investigate which one(s) could be a legitimate font match.\r\nIf I'm still
    not sure about the legitimacy of a font, I simply skip this font-id request and
    don't publish any answers - this is a (my) \"err on the safe side\" action. \r\n\r\nIn
    case of \"Raspoutine\", I can't find any close similar fonts (either commercial
    of free).\r\nIf anybody can spot such a font, I will gladly remove the font name
    from all my posts in this thread.\r\n"
