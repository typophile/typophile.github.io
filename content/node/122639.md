body: Hi - I bought TransType 4 and am very happy with its functions. It lists the
  fonts nicely, converts ttf into otf and lets you overlap the fonts over each other
  in colored transparencies for checking, etc. With the click of a button it creates
  all the files woff, eot, etc. needed for webfonts.  It also autohints the webfonts
  without being asked! I did not check the quality of the autohinting in the Latin
  characters, but I definitely do not want it in the Arabic glyphs. Is there a way
  to delete this function? Or to remove hinting from relevant file(s) in the finished
  webfont folder? Thanks.

  body: Apologies!!  The autohinting happens when converting TTF to OTF not for webfonts!  Perhaps
    a clearer head than mine can confirm that.  Anyway it would be great if TransType
    gives you a choice in its preferences about autohinting.  Now how to remove hinting
    from OT?  Thanks.

  body: "I'm sure there must be some way to automate that, but I don't know of a simple
    one without introducing scripting or other commercial tools.\r\n\r\nI am curious...
    so, you dislike the effect of the autohinting on the Arabic, and want it unhinted
    instead? In what rendering environments is it better?"

  body: "Thanks Thomas \r\nwish I had extensive experience in hinting / unhinting
    to justify my preference for unhinted Arabic. An experienced Arabic type designer
    and another well-versed in under-the hood programming advised against it. The
    latter did not like how it ironed out quirky details in his Latin font. For myself
    I experimented for a while with Fontlab's autohinting, looked at the hinting waterfall
    effect and saw drastic distortions as size diminishes. The dots, essential information
    carriers in half the Arabic  letters in particular suffer the most.\r\nSomething
    related I often wondered about - are there hybrid fonts whereby an outline font
    functions normall but then a pixel font kicks in and displays below a given small
    size?"

  body: "Currently, just about all rendering environments ignore the bitmaps in such
    hybrid fonts. So, functionally, no.\r\n\r\nI'd like it if you could send me an
    example of an autohinted font that's performing badly. I'd like to look at the
    hints. But broadly speaking, FontLab's autohinter for PostScript outlines is pretty
    darn good. It's only a tiny bit behind the Adobe PS autohinter, which is the gold
    standard.\r\n\r\nAlso, as an aside (and not meant to sidestep the issue): why
    are you creating OTF from TTF for webfonts? Is it because you can get smaller
    sizes out of them?"

  body: "Hi Thomas \r\nToo bad about hybrid fonts - it would seem an ideal solution
    for tiny texts.\r\nI apologise for the misleading topic headline. Perhaps I have
    waded in too deep and above my head into these technicalities!\r\n\r\n I guessed
    perhaps wrongly  that FL's autohinter is fine-tuned to Latin script with its well-defined
    Asc and Desc and x heights. Arabic outlines go all over the place. In Arabic my
    main concern was the dots - which are the only way to distinguish various letters
    in half the alphabet! A dots should reduce to a single well-defined pixels at
    minimum size. The autohinter however turned two dots, for example into two lines
    at an angle, or made three dots stick together into one square as in the example
    below.\r\n\r\nI like OT because it preserves the PS outlines with which I designed
    my fonts in the belief - again perhaps mistaken - that that will better preserve
    them on display. \r\n\r\nThe two images are of the same letter - a direct photo
    of the screen of the unhinted glyph displayed in  Text Edit at 10 points is more
    or less recognisable. The Fontlab screenshot of the TT hinting of the same letter
    the three dots  and three 'teeth' become unrecognisable. It would be wonderful
    if this can be improved. Thanks.\r\n\r\nVladimir\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FullSizeRender_5846.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: "Thomas - \r\n\r\nRight. I am learning bout hinting as I go along - it was
    the last step of designing my fonts.  \r\nI did not pay attention and in the example
    used a version with TT outlines from one of the fonts converted to TT en route
    to VOLT . I prefer PS for its economy of dots. Would FL autohinting treat PS outlines
    differently than those converted to  TT?\r\nI have not tried adding blue lines
    - there are just too many levels for the dots and other marks in my fonts.  Newfangled
    Arabic fonts and webfonts that have changed the Arabic letters to give them a
    level x-height. Those do have the dots on the same level - but they are all but
    unreadable for the design changes and tiny dot size.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    TT hinting are quite different things. PS and TT rendering are done by different
    rasterizers, as well."

    does make a difference - Type 1 autohinting of PS outlines keeps the dots in their
    proper places- up to a point. It works for this one glyph but I have to see what
    happens with the entire font. Thanks Thomas[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
