body: "Is it possible to execute the FontLab 5 \u201CUpdate [kern] feature\u201D command
  with Python using some of the FL/Python methods or a MenuCommand from Python?\r\n\r\nWhen
  generating class kerned instances from a MM design it is kind of boring to go into
  the Kerning Assistance dialog and push the \u201CUpdate [kern] feature\u201D button
  for all instances each time you build a new version of a family to be tested.\r\n\r\nAny
  other recommendations to optimize this workflow if there is no Python way?"

  body: "Yes you can. The font object has a method \r\n\r\n<code>.MakeKernFeature()</code>\r\n\r\nBut
    then, you may also consider using AFDKO's function for generating the kern feature.
    I think it is in a separate module which you could call from your script."

  body: "It seems that <em>.MakeKernFeature()</em> does not add a kern feature to
    the font directly. Rather, it returns a Feature object which needs to be added
    to the font's feature list in an additional step:\r\n\r\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f
    = fl.font\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kernFeature = f.MakeKernFeature()\r\n</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    delete existing kern feature:\r\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for feaIdx in range(len(f.features)-1,-1,-1):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
    features[feaIdx].tag == \"kern\":\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;del
    features[feaIdx]\r\n</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# append new kern
    feature to feature list:\r\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.features.append(kernFeature)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fl.UpdateFont(fl.ifont)\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Thanks, that's very helpful Karsten.\r\n\r\nIs there also a method for compiling
    the OpenType features in FontLab?\r\n\r\nOr is there documentation of all the
    Python objects in FontLab 5 somewhere online? Sadly the unofficial FontLab 4.5
    Python reference hasn't been updated for ages...\r\n\r\n-Paul\r\n\r\nwww.type-invaders.com"

  body: "Hello! Recently I found <em>OTCompile</em> in the <a href=\"http://dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/html/MenuCommands.xml.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">reference</a>, so you could try using this by way of <em>fl.CallCommand()</em>.
    But I have not tried it yet. (I remember problems when reading <em>fl.output</em>
    in FLS5/Mac, so could not check if there are compilation errors.)\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes, Karsten"

  body: "In case you don't care about updating the 'kern' feature in the VFB file,
    but still want to have the OTF fonts generated with an up-to-date 'kern' feature,
    an alternative approach is to play around with the FontLab's Preferences (a.k.a.
    Options) via Python scripting. Here's the code snippet,\r\n<code>\r\n# Start the
    script by checking if the option 'Generate \r\n# OpenType \"kern\" feature if
    it is undefined or outdated'\r\n# is turned on. Turn it on if it's currently off.\r\nrevertPreferences
    = False\r\nif (Options().TTEWriteKernFeature == 0):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options().TTEWriteKernFeature
    = 1\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revertPreferences = True\r\n\r\n# Here make the
    script do whatever it needs to do,\r\n# including generating the OT font(s)\r\n\r\n#
    Finalize the script by reverting the option,\r\n# in case it has been changed\r\nif
    (revertPreferences == True):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options().TTEWriteKernFeature
    = 0\r\n\r\n</code>"
