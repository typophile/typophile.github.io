That Part of the Script Guide I mentioned shows many freeware fonts included in with the commercial ones.

		<div class="commentbody">Just as a follow up I took my own suggestion and wrote to House Industries.  A person wrote back and told me that they think their fonts are properly priced and that less than $5 per font in that collection is a very reasonable price. She said that they do not, however, sell individual fonts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So when you see a House font you like, remember, it's the whole collection/family or nothing when you buy them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I gave them my opinon that was only a good deal for someone who wants to use all the fonts, but I suppose it is just another marketing strategy as you talked about in another thread today with the Lineto fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, don't forget the t-shirt that comes with the $250 set! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weren't the fonts in House's General Collection originally available individually, or at least in smaller sets? I do think $250 is way too much for the set &ndash; at best you're probably going to only use any five of the fonts, and probably not too often at that, so practically it's more like $50 a font, and that's not a very good deal. I just bought* Neutraface, and at $199 for one huge family I think I got a much better deal than I would have had I bought* the General Collection, even though I'd have gotten a t-shirt as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At least with the other sets, there's more of a theme to them (so you're likely to use a majority of the fonts in the set), as well as a more limited number of fonts per set so the price is more reasonable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other thing is that back when the fonts in the General Collection were new, House was one of the few small foundries that were becoming more widely known, so well-made quirky fonts like these were much more rare. Now that the market is more or less flooded with them, having them available only as an expensive set seems bad for business. With Rich Roat jokingly complaining over at Typographica that making their new book put them in the poorhouse, as it were, someone might impress upon him the good business sense of offering individual faces at $20-30 a pop. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just sayin'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Oh, and Seksay: don't do it, baby &ndash; it's the first step on the road to hell.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*bought an overly restrictive license to use, that is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

It was polite and brief.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry, we do sell individual fonts. A lot of work goes into the making of quality fonts so we believe our prices are fair. At $250 for the collection, and 51 fonts plus clip art, each font in the General Collection comes to less than $5. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lynn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it's funny, almost Freudian, that she omitted the word 'not' in the first sentence.
