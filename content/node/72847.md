    300 Baskerville variations on fonts.com, no luck on a match. \r\n\r\nBut apologies
    are in order. I've given all folks the wrong clue. The trailer doesn't seem to
    have the same typeface as in the titles and credits for the film. My blunder...\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone has the dvd of the film, it's worth a watch.  And if you have any thoughts
    on the typeface, let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts...  "

    Packard Antique. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions as to where I can download the complete
    font library for Packard Antique. A free or low cost site would be appreciated,
    as it's for a non-profit org.\r\n\r\nA related question for Akos: how were you
    able to get an image from the titles or credits of the film? Apparently you were
    able to capture and save individual frames from a dvd. What software was used?
    Is it available for the PC?\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts! "
