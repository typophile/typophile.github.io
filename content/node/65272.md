body: "for a display typeface with OT alternates i'm looking for a way to best make
  the following stroke patterns. this is of course a not so perfect example, exporting
  to illustrator and using pathfinder and re-exporting to fontlab obviously leads
  to points being moved to fit onto the 1000pt grid.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-14-1_5896.gif]\r\n\r\naction/gradient
  is the nearest effect i could find and i guess i would need a python script to really
  make this work, but have no idea where to start. is there anyone that by chance
  already has such a script and would like to share it, or something similar? :)\r\n\r\nthanks
  for any help!"
