body: I purchased the Casino Buffet Font Pack and the Doggie Bag Font Pack from Font
  Diner like 6 or 7 months ago. The hard drive that these fonts were on crapped out
  on me, and I didn&#39;t back anything up. I&#39;ve been trying to email Font Diner,
  but with no response. Im emailing every address I can find. I looked up my credit
  card statement from back when, so I could get Font Diner&#39;s number. I call the
  mumber and its some lady&#39;s apartment and she never heard of Font Diner before.
  I really need these fonts, and I don&#39;t want to fork out $50 for something I
  already own. Any help would be appreciated... <BR> <BR>Thanks

    for the hassles you&#39;ve been having, due to overwhelming spam that comes from

    has probably deleted your e-mail attempts to us before they ever landed in our
    inbox. <BR> <BR>Rest assured we&#39;re still tweaking them to work better, regardless
    please fill out and submit a comment card at our site with your e-mail address

    <BR>Thanks for your patience, <BR>Stuart :D
