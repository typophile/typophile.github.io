  body: "Probably a unique design; possibly based on [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/c/college.htm|College
    Contour, by Dieter Steffmann]] - It's the font with filename CollegeC in the downloadable
    zip file. Here's what it looks like:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SeaDevilsCollegeContour_4987.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
    are many other similar 'collegiate' style fonts, some identified as 'outline',
    some as 'contour' and so forth."

  body: "Thank you for your help, I have been looking up a san-serif typeface in \"old
    school\" and \"outline\" but I could not find anything to the exact details, -the
    octagon shape is right but this one is still san serif.\r\n\r\n -Is the typeface
    you have displayed the original of the download? I assume you altered it? Is that
    right? I downloaded this and it was a serif typeface. \r\n\r\nAlso the \"s\" and
    the \"AE\" are not the same\r\n\r\nI tried looking again, Machine, was the other
    typeface that was suggested to me.. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/50750/Machine_Bold\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know where you're seeing any serifs. The zip file that downloads
    from the  link I posted (click on \"Download T1\")  contains three versions of
    the font, each with .pfb, .pfm, and unnecessary .afm and .ifm files.\r\n\r\nThe
    image is from that font as I downloaded it.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"AE\" in your
    sample. There is an E and and A, which were tied together graphically as a custom
    creation done with the rest of the logo creation process (which might have included
    a customized proprietary font).\r\n\r\nMachine is one of many similar base fonts.
    There is no published version of Machine with an outline; Here is the text with
    such an outline artificially added.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SeaDevilsMachine_4346.jpg]\r\nIn
    fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Steffmann used Machine as a base from which to
    create his College fonts.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: Already having a font with the same name installed would result in your system's
    using the installed font.  As would a corrupted font-cache, etc. Can you post
    an image of what you're receiving (do a screen capture )
