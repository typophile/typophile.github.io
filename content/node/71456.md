    overwhelming, the website\u2026 didn't know it either, another bookmark. :)\r\n\r\nI
    thought it was going to be something more common, though. Hum. How do you even
    come up with this?! :P\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks a lot for your help, Jan. :)"

    TypeID have all been for friends of mine\u2026 :P You know how it goes: \u201CHey,
    Ruben, what typeface is this?\u201D And Ruben goes searching, fails miserably,
    and comes to Typophile for comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd if I do come to the TypeID forum
    for myself, I'm not trying to recreate what I show or in need of said typeface;
    I'm just looking to satisfy my curiosity. :P"

    TF Arrow is pretty common.\r\nAt least it pops up here quite frequently."

    typeface vendors, so I always find it a bit amazing that people would know it.
    :P Of course, I'm aware there's nothing really amazing about it, but still, it's
    nice to be amazed, so I let myself go with it. :P\r\n\r\nAnd I meant I was thinking
    it would be something I'd already know, at least with a name I'd recognize. I
    guess I shouldn't really use the word \u201Ccommon\u201D, it doesn't work that
    well as a qualifier, it's very subjective. :)"

    he might be familiar with the site and the product. I''m probably taking that

    one of the first things that popped up in my mind when I saw the logo, but I knew
    that wasn't it, so I started a search and then ended up here.\r\n\r\nSaw your
    blog, nice little characters!\r\n\r\nI have to stop doing this, I always take
    the threads were I participate too far away from the main subject. :P"
