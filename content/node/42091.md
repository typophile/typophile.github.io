  for a consortium of tradesmen providing a variety of services including plumbing,
  heating, solar power and gas fittings for the home.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if
  you would critique my attempts so far, and provide any insights to improvements.\r\n\r\nKind

  body: "I like the basic concept. Maybe a square so the elements don't look so just
    thrown together. The t fitting looks a little out of scale with the others. Maybe
    a drop of water or a wrench. And the bulb with the sun maybe reversed so the sun
    is dominant. Green, while nice and ecological may be a misleading color for solar.
    Maybe an orange or yellow. Please forgive my hasty rendering/scribbling.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heat_3486.jpg]"

    you should try another font which shows much less contrast and delicateness. And
    i do not connect this kind of delicat font with this branch also. '

  body: "Overall it looks nice! I prefer the horizontal composition on the top right.
    \r\n\r\nI agree with Michael's comments on the icons. However I quite like the
    existing colours. Since you've got fairly self explanatory pictograms, I wonder
    if it's okay even if a colour doesn't readily connote the respective idea. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure whether you need the vertical rule between the symbol and the type. Also
    do you realy need the period marks after the 'I' and the 'L'. I think not.\r\n\r\nI
    think you should adjust the alignment between the name and descriptor visually
    and not let the software do it. That way the 'P' of the Plumbing would not align
    to the left edge of the serif of the 'I', but rather to vertical stroke of the
    'I'. Similarly, the 'S' in Gas would align to the vertical stroke of the 'Y'.

  body: "I like the circles. The pipes is the odd-one-out, though. The other three
    focus on 'waves/elements' while the plumbing is literally some pipes.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest maybe incorporating water/waves into the plumbing icon to tie them all
    together ab it more. (and I now see that logosam pretty much said the same thing!)"

    a warning label. Otherwise, it looks great!

  body: "The type treatment feels disconnected from your icons. It\u2019s the sort
    of conservative serif style that one uses to make an attorney or banker seem older
    and established. \r\n\r\nThe icons themselves are great, but will work a lot better
    if they don\u2019t abut. Circles are very powerful visual elements, when they
    form those points inbetween themselves they get too be distracting."

  body: I like the circles but I also thought someone's suggestion of using squares
    so the icons would fit together is a good idea. Perhaps uniting the circles like
    the Olympics logo would be an interesting melding of both concepts. Since it is
    a consortium of trades, it would make sense to have them linked in some fashion.
    Then again it might take a simple idea and complicate it -still worth a try. Also
    play more with the typography, your icons need a more substantial font, what you
    currently have is too thin and delicate. Simplifying the pipe icon to a water
    drop or waves is also a good idea. terrific start - keep it going.

  body: "On the top left example in the link you provided: No, no, no! Plumbing is
    below the house and water always finds the lowest place, so the symbol for plumbing
    should be on the bottom, not the top. The sun is in the sky, solar panels on the
    roof, and lighting on the ceiling, so that symbol should always be on top.\r\nI
    recommend that you use an arrangement based upon a hexagonal tiling, with solar
    on the top, plumbing on the bottom, and heat and gas in the middle.\r\nBeyond
    a basis in hexagonal tiling, I feel you should follow the surface tension lead
    even further (hexagonal tiling is the most perimeter efficient arrangement, and
    so it the most surface-area efficient two dimensional arrangement), and base the
    shapes on how soap bubbles actually fit together (soap bubbles always for the
    most efficient arrangement), as seen on the left here:\r\n[[http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v5/n11/images/7400274-f2.jpg]]\r\nRotating
    it would form equally valid arrangements (especially by 90 degrees), and I'm only
    showing this orientation because it is what I could find."
