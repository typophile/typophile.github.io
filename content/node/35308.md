body: "I'm looking for information on how the apostrophe \"should\" be kerned in the
  case of contractions and possessives, like <em>don't</em>, <em>he'd</em>, <em>Pete's</em>
  and <em>James'</em>. In particular, I'm interested to hear what people think of
  the very tight kerning in Minion Pro.\r\n\r\nThe most extreme combination that I
  have found in Minion Pro is <em>e'd</em>, which is set almost exactly as <em>ed</em>
  with the apostrophe added afterwards, that is, no extra space whatsoever. To me,
  this doesn't look very good: for instance, it almost turns <em>he'd</em>/<em>she'd</em>
  into <em>hed</em>/<em>shed</em>. <em>I'd</em> looks similar.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  a small sample for reference (original font size is 10pt), keep in mind that I'm
  talking about running text here, not headings and so on. The sample shows metric
  and optical kerning in InDesign CS3. I've also included four lines set using LaTeX,
  showing how the different groupings look. (I couldn't do it in InDesign: it seems
  as if InDesign ignores zero-width spaces when it does metric kerning?) Please ignore
  that the InDesign text is grey and not black, a mistake on my part.\r\n\r\nTo me,
  InDesign's optical kerning looks better in the case of <em>he'd</em>, but not necessarily
  so in the case of quotation marks. An easy way to differentiate the two would be
  if different code points were used, for example U+02BC (<code>MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE</code>)
  in <em>he'd</em> and U+2019 (<code>RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</code>) in quotes.
  However, the Unicode Consortium thinks otherwise, stating that U+2019 should be
  used for <em>he'd</em> and so on, leaving U+02BC for glottal stops and such; see
  The Unicode Standard 5.0, section 6.2, \"Apostrophes\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but
  I don't think it is possible using OpenType and metric kerning to encode \"conditional\"
  kerning, where the apostrophe is kerned differently depending on whether or not
  it is a quote, as instructed by the software. Of course, it would be possible to
  add <em>a'd</em>, <em>b'd</em>, <em>c'd</em>, ..., to the kerning table, leaving
  the rest as kern-as-in-quote, but that would really bloat the kerning table (or
  the other way around, if all characters preceding a quote are known).\r\n\r\nObviously,
  this must have been a conscious design decision by Slimbach, so I really don't feel
  comfortable just changing it to something of my liking without a second opinion.
  Having said that, I'd be happy if you could tell me which of the four LaTeX samples
  (<code>He'd</code>, <code>He{'d}</code>, <code>H{e'}d</code>, <code>He{'}d</code>)
  you think looks best.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the tight kerning is great, and I just have
  to learn how to read it...\r\n\r\nTried searching the archives, but I didn't find
  anything."

  body: "I'm a great admirer of Slimbach, but I agree that his kerning of both apostrophes
    and quotes is much too tight. \r\n\r\nTo me, the kerning in the apostrophe ideally
    would be between your Slimbach and the 'Optical' examples. The second Latex example
    is in the middle of the space, which looks right, but personally I'd like a little
    more space. \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that the apostrophes should ideally be tighter
    than quotes. I'm going to have to deal with the soon in my font, but I don't know
    the best way to do it. I'd be interested in others' views. \r\n\r\nRight now I'm
    inclining to the view that one space around the right single quote should be able
    to serve both as a quote and an apostrophe, without a huge amount of kerning.
    After all, that's how they did it with metal type, and it worked well enough.
    \r\n\r\nIn 'Letters of Credit', Tracy recommends a little more space after the
    opening quotes than before closing quotes. This tightness would also serve to
    keep the apostrophe not too loose.  "

  body: "Spacing is something that is language dependent. If your text is to contain
    many languages, changing the spacing in the font itself is thus of no help. LaTeX
    provides a mechanism that solves that problem, namely the babel package; by specifiying
    in the input what language you are starting to use, LaTeX uses the appropriate
    spacing and hyphenation patterns for the input till the next language change.
    For your question, here is a very basic file <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/myspacing.ldf\">myspacing.ldf</a>
    that does the job. First, instead of kerning by 0.5pt, it kerns by 0.05em, so
    as to handle all font sizes. If you put the file <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/myspacing.ldf\">myspacing.ldf</a>
    in your working directory and have the following input\r\n<code>\r\n\\usepackage[myspacing]{babel}\r\n\\begin{document}\\noindent\r\n\\Myspacingtrue\r\n\\LARGE
    he's \\Large he's \\large he's \\normalsize he's\\\\[0.5ex]\r\n\\Myspacingfalse\r\n\\LARGE
    he's \\Large he's \\large he's \\normalsize he's\r\n\\end{document}\r\n</code>\r\nthen
    the output will be\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/output_5211.gif]\r\nYou
    can turn on and off at will your spacing convention and adjust the file myspacing.ldf
    so as to get exactly what you want. All you need to do is to fix in it the line\r\n<code>\r\n
    \   \\kern0.05em\\string'\\kern0.05em\r\n</code>\r\nso as to get the kerning you
    want.\r\n\r\nIf someone that knows more about babel is watching, I would be glad
    to learn how I could improve this little ldf file.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n[edit]
    There are problems with double quotes and for some reason, this file interferes
    with \"thebibliography\". It is thus far from being a \"product\". I think the

    with \\documentclass{article} and a command to select the font Minion Pro."

  body: "Thanks to everyone who responded, I very much appreciate the input.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    fonts in LaTeX, you should all try XeTeX. I've only used it on Mac OS X, but it
    gives you direct access to fonts installed in the system, making it extremely
    easy to try out new fonts. (\"Extremely easy\" if you're used to (La)TeX font
    installations, \"as easy as you'd expect\" if you're not.)\r\n\r\nThe main drawback
    with XeTeX, I think, is that it doesn't support the microtype package (protrusion,
    font expansion and such) and I found direct PDF generation a bit tricky, but it
    works once you find the right driver.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an easy way of
    getting Minion Pro in LaTeX, namely using the <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro/\">MinionPro</a>
    package (project home page is <a href=\"http://developer.berlios.de/projects/minionpro\">here</a>).
    The installation is pretty simple and really fast since they have already extracted
    the metrics (which in the case of Optical sizes take an eternity). The package
    also allows easy switching between different figures, see the <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro/MinionPro.pdf\">documentation</a>.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, there is a <code>loosequotes</code> option, which adds 0.03 em around every
    single and double quote. However, I'm a bit reluctant to use it since I'm quite
    happy with the spacing in for example <em>f's</em> (= <code>f's</code>), and I
    want to disturb the original font design as little as possible.\r\n\r\nIf you
    don't already have a working LaTeX installation, I'd recommend trying <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/texlive/\">TeX
    Live</a>. Using the live-DVD you only have to install a small number of files
    (all in one single directory), the rest is accessed from a mounted DVD image."

    with the version of the otf font I installed. If we apply vftovp for instance
    to the file MinionPro-Regular-lf-t1.vf, we can see that the virtual font kerns
    \ a \"d\" by -0.138  after a quoteright (coded as octal 47). Many other vf files
    contain that kerning pair, to take care of the various package options. That means
