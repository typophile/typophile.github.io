  font for me.\r\n\r\nThe type in red. Sorry is rather small.\r\nhttp://www.thisisthenewyear.com/_img/work/DrewHolcomb.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
  also here, in a slightly larger size.\r\nhttp://www.thisisthenewyear.com/_img/work/LuceroMNPLS.jpg\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated, I really like this font.\r\n\r\nThanks"
