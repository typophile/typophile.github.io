  body: I don't know if the Royal Academy of Arts (kabk.nl) has a particular visiting
    policy and I myself won't be around next week, but down the street from us is
    the always stunning Meermanno Westreenianum, the book museum.

    At my college it seemed prospective students could book individual tours all year
    round, as excessive as that sounds!\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip off\r\n\r\nAndrew"
