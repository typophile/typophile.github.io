  body: "The F looks like a dagger which is kinda neat.\r\n\r\nWhat is the logo for
    and what do you want to say with it? With a little more information about the
    background of the logo you are working on, I'd be able to give you a little more
    help.\r\n\r\nKeith"

    Ramsay.\r\n\r\nI'd like to create a vector of it, and am brutal at tracing."

  body: I have managed to vectorize it, but am still interested in whether this is
    a font, or a custom job.

  body: Almost certain they modified a "f" for the logo. You don't need to trace the
    whole letter. Start with a Helvetica "f"... remove the point in the lower right
    corner and change the point in the lower left. Give me a minute and I'll create
    it for you as a PDF which you can open to see how it was accomplished.

  body: "Not my best work but considering I spent less than 2 minutes it should do
    the trick. I ended up using DIN for the \"f\" and modified it slightly. \"THE
    WORD\" was set in Helvetica Bold and horizontally scaled to 110% with a bunch
    of tracking.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nrgsoft.com/rochon/The-F-Word.pdf\">The
