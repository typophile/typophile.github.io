body: I've noticed that the letter J is rarely used these days. Do you think I should
  bother including a J in my fonts or can I just leave it out?

    words here is ja, meaning and. Of course, we could always combine i and comma

    fall by the wayside again, like the long s did nearly two hundred years ago. And
    does anyone even know what to use a Wynn for?

    They are used very frequently so all of our text would become much shorter so
    we would need less paper and not have to cut down as many trees. See, there is
    a perfect example, \"trees\" would become simply \"rs\" and if we also left out

  body: "Seriously, the alphabet we use currently has evolved over time in a completely
    willy nilly fashion with a great many redundancies that don't really enrich language
    at all. As designers, we all know this, yet we it meekly accept it as a fact of
    life. But does it need to be like that? NO. It doesn't. We're designers, after
    all. I think that now would be as good a time as any for some rationalization
    and culling of unnecessary and wasteful letters, in much the same way that the
    dozens of different and idiocentric weights and measures systems used in France
    were culled and replaced by the infinitely more rational metric system at the
    end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nWe could probably whittle the number of letters
    in the standard alphabet down by 25% to 30%. \r\n\r\nTaking the letter \"J\" as
    an example: In many languages it is pronounced as a \"Y\" sound or even an \"h\".
    In French, it is pronounced \"zh\", so the assertion that these languages can't
    get by without a \"j\" is simply not true. The name, James is really Iago. Jack
    is really John which is really Ivan, and so on. Jorge is really George, and is
    pronound Horhay anyhow! If a \"J\" sound is really ever actually required, \"ge\"
    or \"zh\" work just fine.\r\n\r\n@ jazzhustler: My Norwegian Grandmother, didn't
    like any music that didn't have a polka beat, or sound like it was made up by
    Vikings in quiet moments between pillagings. Any other form of music, she would
    denounce fiercely with: \"Dat's yoost yass!\" You see. There's my point; no need
    for \"j\", \"th\" \"u\" or even \"z\". You'll always have yass. (or iass, since
    the \"y\" is really just a redundancy of the letter \"i\") Cutting the alphabet
    down by 30% is actually quite conservative, when you think about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    just Trade Gothic or some similar face with the explanation:\r\n\r\n\"Stalled
    on a problem, Ben did a statistical study of the standard Roman alphabet, and,
    finding that the letter q was the least used, eliminated it. It was a typographic
    apotheosis. The Cueless typeface was born, one of many that Ben was to create.\""
