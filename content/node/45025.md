  going to produce a magazine around clubbing and the creative environment that this
  culture creates in my home town.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a grotesque font with a
  big family that can work in a rather small size if used as body text, but also has
  other weights that works well in capitals if for example  used as headings. I would
  like it to be quite contemporary or a \"modern classic\", maybe with some special
  distinctions- but still the most important thing is that it's easy to read in a
  small size and that it will look good in text column (not too loose, not too thin
  or too black). I'd like a font that's is also not too round if you understand what
  I mean.\r\n\r\nI hope that some of you might give me some suggestions on fonts that
  would work well in my magazine, I would be really grateful for some help\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks"
