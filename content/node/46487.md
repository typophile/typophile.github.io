  photography and needs a logo/identity for a gallery he will be selling some photos
  in. I'm not working with any real concept because I want to shy away from using
  a camera symbol, etc... I'm just having fun with his initials\u2014\"M\" & \"W\"\u2014and
  going for some sort of monogram. This is one of the concepts I've been playing with,
  just something fun (I thought it was pretty trippy/interesting). Anyway, I would
  love to get some feedback on it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mw3_6241.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mw1_5612.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mw2_5141.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "Love the mark. The italic text looks a bit odd as the angle is not as steep
    as the mark.\r\nThe caps are best but the placement could be better thought out
    (maybe)."

    with - it has the same w/h ratio of a standard 6X4 photo.\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Nice logo, but I think its a bit confusing at the moment. People might not
    be able to read the letters M and W if its standing alone in the space like in
    your very first image. You need to add a visual break after the letter M somehow.\r\n\r\nSome
    similar logos I found while searching.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mw_6129.jpg]"

  body: No, I think you should stay with the first concept. Just play with it, you
    aren't so far.

    that a grocery store''s might. I liked the original mark and the direction of
    it. '

  body: I agree with Miss Tiffany. The italic looks odd because of the different angle
    thou. Experiment a little more with the type... the mark is looking good.

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nlove the initial mark. Don't worry about legibility, it's a
    mark and not spelling out your name.\r\n\r\nWhy not just try a simple line of
    text set in a sans serif (maybe Gotham) below? \r\n\r\nLooking forward to the
    final result.\r\n\r\nSeb"
