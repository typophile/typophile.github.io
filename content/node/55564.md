body: "Hi Typophilian Mates\r\n\r\nI just done a new fontface design.. called \"Serifada\"
  based on concept of Chilean Hitory.. following some aesthetics and synesthetic asociations.
  Although this can be clasified  like display that hard serif and broken shapes help
  to make a better readable text. I don't an expert but I done some test and run so
  well on small sizes.\r\n\r\nI hope get your opinions and critiques\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serifada_1st-WIP-show_3725.png]\r\n\r\nregards..!!\r\n=)\r\nPedro
  [PeGGO]\r\n\r\nNOTE: The old name \"Politica\" belong to Ale Paul font, an now my
  design name has been changed by \"Politic\""

    you post a effect-less PDF? \r\n\r\nOne thing that does stand out now is that
    the spacing needs quite a bit of work."
