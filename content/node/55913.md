body: "(I don't know if that name is available, but that's what I have it called for
  internal purposes) \r\n\r\nAnyway, here is my first \"constructed\" typeface. I
  realized I had never built a geometric typeface before, so I started on this. I
  like the look of bitmap types and of course, constructivist types, so that's what
  I was going for here. Oh, and it's monospaced.\r\n\r\nCritiques welcome :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/constructive_6226.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://dangayle.com/ftp/constructive.pdf|Version

  body: The W seems a little uptight. And the diff between k and l (ell) seems a little
    odd. I guess you'd need to see a paragraph or two before really knowing? And the
    p and q. Maybe I'm not the target audience. ;^)

  body: "Ascenders and descenders are certainly a problem, now that I look at it.
    The second I posted this I realized that the LC k was having issues. It looks
    bigger than the rest of the lower case. And I forgot the reason I made the LC
    l not ascender hight. I'll have to revisit that.\r\n\r\nThe W is going to feel
    cramped in any monospace, but I do see that there is some improvement I can make.
    The inside cuts should be lowered, that's what I notice right away. \r\n\r\nI'll
    set a paragraph in the font, but I assure you, it won't be pretty :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/constructive_4304.png]"

  body: "You\u2019re being too conservative in a few ways (I ran into the same problem
    with the constructivist types I\u2019ve worked on and never released). You stick
    to historical constructivist form in M and N, but then break to idealized serif
    form in E and F. And you\u2019re trying to force some creativity with f, l, and
    p in a way that\u2019s too academic. Loosen up some\u2014the constructivists did
    some crazy things with their letters, but to find it you have to stay away from
    the the experiments of the Dutch and German designers whose funky letters make
    a nice-looking alphabet but bad-looking words; IMHO only the Stenberg brothers
    did regimented lettering very well. Check out the early chapter\u2019s of Maria
    LaFont\u2019s <em>Soviet Posters</em> to see examples of the stuff that doesn\u2019t
    turn up in every history book\u2014there\u2019s a lot more possibility when stuff
    gets weird and less conceptual."

  body: "So I took your advise, and added a feature that I had previously contemplated.
    I cut wedges into the horizontal terminators in a way that I had seen, and surprisingly
    I think it helps the rendering of the fonts when at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I finished my UC numerals. Don't know how I'm going to do the small caps numerals
    though, since there is only so much space to work with at that size.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/constructive_5374.png]\r\n\r\nNew

    I think you\u2019ll get a more interesting design by closing things up and working
    on interactions between the counters. "

  body: "I did think of making the spacing normal, but I would also like to have full
    monospacing as well. I assume thats the kind of thing I can do with opentype.
    Duplicate all the glyphs, then create stylistic alternates.\r\n\r\nMy dual commission
    to myself is to create an interesting pixel-height font as well as an interesting
    display font.\r\n\r\nI will spend some time working on this more. Especially since
    I created the cuts on the left and the right, tightening things up will help everything
    flow better together."
