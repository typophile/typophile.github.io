  any portion of the questions below if you are so inclined. \r\n \r\n\r\nWhat ratio
  of good type usage vs. poor type usage do you encounter on a daily basis (outside
  of work)?\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the typefaces that you see and read everyday (outside of
  work), what percentage can you identify in a few seconds? For how long have you
  worked in your field?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were the first few typefaces you could identify
  instantly?\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any typography specific pet peeves?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
  you are a type designer, what do you think, how do you feel, when you see your work
  out in the world?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you could redesign traits of a specific character
  from a specific typeface which would it be?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often do you find yourself
  identifying the typefaces that you see used in everyday life situations. \r\n\r\nExamples;
  \r\n\r\nSigns \r\nAdverts\r\nBooks\r\nTelevision ads\r\nMovie titles\r\nManuals\r\nGovernment

  body: "I can identify maybe 70% of serif faces I encounter day to day and maybe
    30% of sans. I encounter rare examples of excellent typography and rare examples
    of terrible typography, and a whole lot of typography that has nothing wrong with
    it, per se, but isn't brilliant.\r\n\r\nAmong the first faces I could identify,
    as a budding typophile in eighth grade: Palatino, Minion, Optima. And much younger,
    I thought Comic Sans was awesome, though I don't think I knew what it was called.
    Oh, and Times, but that doesn't count. Actually, I think my learning to recognize
    faces was more about learning to discern between similar designs than anything
    else. All similar faces look alike until you learn their names. (I also do lighting
    for theatre and have had a similar experience there: all blues look alike until
    you can name them by number; e.g., R385 is my favorite.) Of course, once you know
    faces' names, you can't imagine not being able to see their uniqueness.\r\n\r\nLoads
    of typographic pet peeves. Number one: fake small caps, which ruin otherwise beautiful
    books. Also, dingbats and ornaments that I can identify (e.g., \"That's a glyph
    from Adobe Wood Type!\"). Also, handwriting fonts in situations where it would
    have been just as easy and much nicer to scan real handwriting.\r\n\r\nI am not
    a type designer, but I have often wondered what it must be like to see your creations
    out in the wild.\r\n\r\nIf I could change a specific character, I would make the
    horizontal stroke of the swash L in all of Slimbach's faces descend below the
    baseline, instead of annoyingly taking up space on the baseline and causing wide
    gaps. My plans to use Arno, Brioso, Minion, etc. in Swash form have frequently
    been foiled by this trait.\r\n\r\n\"Identifying\" a face is no more a controllable
    reflex than reading a piece of text I happen to be looking at. Try looking at
    a word without reading it. You can't. Same thing with identifying faces. If I
    know it, I will recognize it when I see it. I think this is really about the tendency
    of a designer to \"look at\" a text as well as \"read\" it, whereas the average
    person skips the first step (or it happens subconsciously) and simply reads it."
