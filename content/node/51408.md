body: "I am working on a font that has two complete alternate character sets with
  identical metrics to the default set. I want to find the best way to ensure that
  each set is kerned against the other two. It seems like the easiest way to handle
  this is to use kerning classes. Does that seem like the right way to handle this?
  \r\n\r\nThis also seems like a good case for automation; I might be able to work
  out the scripting in the same time it takes to create the classes and double-check
  them all. Does anyone agree or disagree, or are there any reasons to not do this
  with scripting?"

  body: "Class kerning is the answer. It does not matter so much about it being an
    alternate or not as it does the the forms of the glyphs being grouped in a class
    have enough similarity to require the same kerning. Individual kerning without
    classes is more likely to cause FLS to explode.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I should be more specific: Set up classes for non-alternate glyphs. Then
    add alternates by script.\r\n\r\nWe don't you well enough to tell you if you'll
    blow up FontLab or not!\r\n\r\nBtw, reading classes from a RoboFab font object:\r\n<code>classes
    = f.naked().classes</code>\r\n\r\nWhich is a list of class definitions as you
    find them in the bottom right field of the Classes Panel:\r\n<code>[\"_1ST_UC_A:
    A' Adieresis\", \"_2ND_UC_A: A' Adieresis\"]</code>\r\n\r\nAfter modifying this
    list, you write it back to the font:\r\n<code>f.naked().classes = classes</code>\r\n\r\nInbetween
    reading and writing it's just text operations."

  body: "If you're more adept with a mouse than with Python, you can also use this
    short cut:\r\n\r\n1. Set up a kerning class for the base glyph.\r\n2. Select all
    the other glyphs in the font window that you want to add to the class.\r\n3. Drag
    them to either the upper-right pane of the class panel, or onto the name of the
    class in the class list on the left.\r\n\r\nNote: For this operation, it's a good
    idea to have the class panel to the left of the font window. Otherwise, as you
    drag past the list of classes, you may unintentionally switch to a different class
    before you get to the upper-right pane. If the class panel is on the right, you
    have to be careful not to drag over the list when you don't mean to drop the glyphs
    there."

  body: "Or do some copy/paste with a text editor:\r\n\r\n(0) name glyphs consistently\r\n(1)
    set up a class with non-alternate glyphs only\r\n(2) copy glyph name list from
    Class Panel's bottom right field into a text editor, add a space at the end\r\n(3)
    for each alternate suffix, do search/replace (e.g. from \" \"[space] to \".alt2
    \"[with space at end!])\r\n(4) remove last space, copy the result back to Class
    Panel's bottom right field, hit apply/ok button\r\n(6) possibly use \"tidy up
    classes\" (or whatever it's called) from the Class Panel's menu\r\nThe last function
    allows you to add, by search/replace, alternate names even of glyphs that are
    not in the font, since the function will remove them.\r\n\r\nI use this method
    when setting up classes for features like c2sc or the numeral-related features."

  body: "I use a method similar to Karsten's. If you select a group of glyphs in FLS
    main windoe and copy, then paste them into a text editor, they arrive seperated
    by slashes. Search and replace the slashes with anything you want--dot alt space,
    .sc space, .superior space, etc..  You can then select the strings you want for
    classes--both kerning and opentype and paste them in the Feature or kerning window
    at the bottom.  I have made bunches of these and reuse them regularly in different
    fonts with minor editing.  You can also export your features file and your classes
    file from one of your previous font designs and import it into your new one giving
    you a complete setup of classes. As long as you always use the same naming scheme,
    this works fine. You will have a few changes to make in classes where the class
    members differ but not as many as you think. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    with classes, and I don\u2019t want to work around them, so it seems best to do
    it all and then just paste it in.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help, all."
