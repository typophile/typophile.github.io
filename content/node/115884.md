  body: "Probably a dot matrix style font resident in the printer.\r\nThe closest
    digital font I have been able to find is Pexico, which mimics a 10 by 14 grid
    for pixels [or dots] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urtd/pexico/ Your sample might
    use a grid of something like 12 by 14 or 14 by 14 to make the wider letters. The
    image is too small to say for certain.\r\nIf you want to simulate a transcript
    of marks, use the monospace version.\r\nDon"
