body: I&#39;m looking for some rounded fonts of the thin variety.  I&#39;ve found
  a few but none of them hit the spot.  The ones I have are Dicot, Isonorm, Fresh,
  FF Droids Sans and Neuropol.  Although, they&#39;re different from each other, the
  last two get quite near what I&#39;m looking for but I wonder if anyone has any
  other good alternatives.  Thanks in advance!!

  body: You should check Identikal fonts. Great Neuropol alternatives such as Curvature
    &amp; Phat.
