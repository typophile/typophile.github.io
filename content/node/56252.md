    Thank you.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, the typography book I have been working on
    for the last few years has been released by Perrousseaux (the french publisher
    of Blanchard and Frutiger books) march 19th in France, Switzerland, Belgium and
    Canada. Some of you typophiles are inside. I'm working on the english version
    right now. You can check the book there: http://www.davidrault.com/guidetypo.\r\n\r\ndr"

    I really hate to be a word snob, but in English, typographers set type. Type designers
    design typefaces. :-)\r\n\r\nAs Stefan says, looking forward to the English version
    of your book!"

    said that already. :-)\r\n\r\nThere might be magazine articles about him in design
    journals... It might be worth checking out a library's online records."

  body: "I found a listing for a book called <em>Letraset: A Lesson in Growth</em>,
    by John Chudley (1974). But, according to Dave Nalle, who discusses it <a href=\"https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0402&L=typo-l&P=958\">here</a>,
    the book is mostly about the business end of things.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Adding to Si's
    comment, Freda Sack or Colin Brignall would also know something about Newman."
