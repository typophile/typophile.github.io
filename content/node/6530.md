body: i&#39;ve been racking my brain forever trying to find a font that has what we
  call a &#39;tail&#39; in it &#40;see right image below&#41;...i have one font with
  it, but the font is also distorted; therefore, the tail will not work. <BR> <BR>does
  anyone know of any fonts that have tails built in? otherwise i&#39;m relegated to
  have someone do some pen drawing in illustrator &#40;i&#39;m a photoshop guy&#41;
  or to buying some athletic logo software. i&#39;d rather just have a font. <BR>
  <BR>any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48220.jpg"

  body: Excellent find, James. I often forget about Letterhead. They have <BR>released
    some great new stuff in the last few months.

  body: The other one I know besides Letterhead&#39;s Pilsner &amp; Ephemera is Leslie
    Cabarga&#39;s <a href="http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage.htm" target="_blank">&#39;Casey&#39;</a>
    family. <BR> <BR>However, the fact is that when you use &#39;tails&#39; you really
    need to be prepared to draw your own.  You can always use the pre-drawn ones from
    the Letterhead fonts, but even with those it helps to maneuver the swashes around
    to achieve the best underlining. They need to be stretched for word lengths, and
    positioned for good connection. You don&#39;t just type them on, like any other
    font character. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to be discouraging, but there are
    limits to what you can expect a font to do.

    Park</a> also has a similar &#39;tail&#39; supplied in one of the option shift
    character slots.
