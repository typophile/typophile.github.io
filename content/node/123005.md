    to tell if the semi-stencil effect in your tiny sample is real, or an artifact
    of the low-res image):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/constantia/\r\n\r\nTyponine
    Stencil is similar, but not a match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/ty-stencil/"

  body: Very small sample, one single letter... You have to admit it'd be hard to
    identify it... Anyway, this graphic with a /a on a grey background reminds me
    vaguely of some [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/DSType|DSType]] MF thumbnail
    previews but part of that, it's a desert... Could you provide more? Additional
    glyphs? Origin (website, magazine...)?
