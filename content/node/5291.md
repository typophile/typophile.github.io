    <BR> <BR>See if you can post a larger version of that, if thats what you want
    to critique, unless your starting from scratch?

  body: The paint splatter to me works much better when it is on the left. When it
    is on the right the web.multimedia.pri.... gets crowded into the descender on
    the p and dosnt look right. <BR> <BR>I would also experiment with other typefaces
    for the name too. To me it has a bit of that futuristic tech feeling to it and
    it kinda clashes with the nature of fine arts and the paint splatter in the logo.
    The k also isn&#39;t very legible in this font too, loks kind of like an x.

  body: do not change G to white. you will loose legibility. <BR> <BR>also make kerning
    between e and a &#40;in &#34;fine art&#34; tigther&#41; Other that that advice.
    I am not sure that there is much to critique as <BR>I do not know what you clients
    are like and/or your skill set.  <BR>question-are you mostly dealing with small
    busineses, non-profit org, corporate or? Clients are what age group, conservative/liberal.
    Location ? Amsterdam, NYC or New Orleans or New Delhi?  <BR> <BR>Aesthetics, design
    etc.. come after these questions are answered.   <BR> <BR>

  body: It is already loosing legibility by having the black g on a orange background.
    Try using the white G on the splatter as a logo. That way your name can be read
    separately and as clear as possible.

    designer. In Middle east &#40;Bahrain&#41;. I have an online art gallery &#40;<a
    href="http://www.gopan.org" target="_blank">www.gopan.org</a>&#41; , which promotes
    Indian contemporary artists. I need to create one logo to be used for all my personal
    as well as commercial activities. <BR> <BR>I am an Indian artist aged 32 completed
    five year National Diploma in Fine Arts &#40;Painting&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I would
    be grateful to you if you could provide some good idea to make out the new logo
    with new identity. <BR>

  body: Hi - <BR> <BR>You could try creating a separate icon with the pain splatter
    &#40;possibly incorporating a G&#41; with your name below or beside the new icon.  <BR>
    <BR>After reviewing your online art gallery &#40;impressive achievments in &#39;about
    artist&#39; section by the way&#41;, I have to say that the paint splatter &#40;and
    the logo in general&#41; is quite generic and not reflective of your artistic
    edge. I would explore some options of how to better express your uniqueness or
    rework the paint splatter to become more of an interesting icon. <BR> <BR>Hope
    that helps a bit! Creating your own identity is always the toughest.

    also type at &#34;web.multimedia.print...&#34; breaks balance at whole logo for

  body: get rid of .r it&#39;s really confusing. No one is going to think that it
    is the first letter of your name. Most people will try and type it into a web
    browser. I actally think that helvetica would be nice for everything. Including
    the g in the logo. However if you try that you might use a Capital G. A capital
    G will have more presence. Good luck.  <BR> <BR>

  body: Gopakumar -- <BR> <BR>I think this icon works much better in communicating
    what you do -- I prefer the lower case g in the icon, perhaps you should experiment
    a little more with the typeface used for your name . . . to me, nothing seems
    to quite work yet. In this example below I have used CG Omega, although I am not
    a font expert, so maybe someone else has some other suggestions for you  . . .
    <BR> <BR>Here is a possible solution to make the &#34;web.multimedia...&#34; make
    your logo feel more &#34;like a unit.&#34;
