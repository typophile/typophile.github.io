body: 'okay, so i&#39;m trying to put together a portfolio and i&#39;ve only tried
  my hand at a couple of logos. The first, Tessa B&#39;s, i rather like, but i think
  it needs a bit more polish. The second, ShoeBox, is really rough. I pretty much
  swiped the design idea from the Beatles. Is it even worth salvaging? showcasing?
  anyhow, i thought i&#39;d just see if i got any response here. thnx for any help
  you can give me. <BR><!--attachment: Tessa_B_logo-39169.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*4.3*Tessa4Flash*Tessa+B+logo%2eSWF

  body: Shoeboxtoo i see. What is the too for?  <BR> <BR>The S, O, and B you should
    weight thicker.  <BR> <BR>Fix the counters on the B.  <BR> <BR>Shoe has a lot
    of white space. I&#39;d open up Boxtoo <BR>which is pretty tight. <BR> <BR>Tracing
    over the logo always helps me to get rid of inconsistencies. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    put a &#34;polished&#34; shoebox in my &#39;folio. <BR>Good stuff.  <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: hey thanks, andrew. i was startin to think i was just gonna be overlooked.
    <BR>Shoeboxtoo - it&#39;s a second location and rather than be ShoeBox 2, they
    opted for Too. I don&#39;t know why they need the too in the name at all, but
    that&#39;s their thing. <BR>thnx again for yer help. anyone else have suggestions?

- body: The Tessa B is cute! <BR>Is the curl above the face meant to resemble hair?
    Seems like a good concept but do you think the style of the lines in the face
    matches the letter style enough? Something I think strong logos have is an overall
    sense of moving to the right or facing the right &#40;the same direction as if
    it were being read with text&#41; are strongest. Layouts, signs, etc. that face
    the right feel more natural to me. &#40;??&#41; <BR>Lastly, the bullet seems to
    large, and maybe it isn&#39;t necessary at all? <BR>I&#39;m not sure the e in
    Tessa and the h in hair have to line up. Does it put too much emphasis on essa?  Dunno.
    <BR> <BR>For shoebox, I like the funky-shaped counters in everything. The two
    o&#39;s do seem like they may need more space at the link for when the logo gets
    reduced to teeny tiny. <BR> <BR>An idea is to apply the logo to packaging, etc.
    to give it more of a context. But if you have lots of logos, you probably would
    be fine just showing it with others. <BR> <BR> <BR>

    face meant to resemble hair?</i> <BR>yeah it is. i guess i don&#39;t have it quite
    right if it&#39;s not obvious. <BR> <BR>i think the bullet and the lining up were
    input from my client, but i can do whatever i want for my own purposes. <BR> <BR><i>

    <BR> <BR>hmmm, i&#39;m not sure how i could fix that for Tessa '
