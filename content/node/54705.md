  body: "I did a lot of looking for this one, and I can't seem to find the right category
    for searching. The uneven strokes have a familiar look, but I couldn't find anything
    at MyFonts or Dafont, and in a couple of font books I had that sort looks by styles.
    About the best I can say is that I don't think it's from any of the major foundries.\r\n\r\n
