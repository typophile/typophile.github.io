  a 6x9 hardcover book, what size do you make the inside pages, which will obviously
  be smaller to allow them to fit within the hardcover?  \r\n\r\nOr do you design
  the pages at 6x9 and then make the hardcover bigger?\r\n\r\nIs there a standard
  size convention used?\r\n\r\nany help would be very much appreciated. Thanks so
  much!!!"

    printer who'll be able to tell you the right size of the cover, spine et cetera.
    The cover size (front + back + spine + inward folding) depends on thickness of
    the cardboard, the chosen style of spine (flat or rounded for instance) and more
    such parameters. Your printer should be able to help you out. \r\n\r\nPreferrably
    you'll contact the printer even before you start designing the pages. Together
    you'll be able to determine optimal sizes.\r\n\r\n"
