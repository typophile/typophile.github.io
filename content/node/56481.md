  Since 2005 the publication has used a bespoke Egyptian typeface called 'Guardian',
  designed by Christian Schwartz - http://www.christianschwartz.com/guardian.shtml.
  The entire family is made up of Guardian Egyptian, Guardian Sans, Guardian Text
  Egyptian, Guardian Text Sans and Guardian Agate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the font is
  not available for licensing yet (though it states on his site that it will be available
  in 2009)... I was wondering though, would anyone would be aware of a similar font
  family available already?... preferably that had a comparable family size - at least
  an Egyptian and Sans version anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    available via <a href=\"http://www.commercialtype.com/\">Commercial Type</a>.

  body: "The Stag Family is a beautiful font... Looking into buying it when I can
    spare the cash!... Out of interest... Would anyone have any other recommendations
    regarding Egyptian fonts? Possibly ones that work well in body copy? I haven't
    used them much in my design work... although they seem to be increasingly popular
    in current publications... GQ's use of Soho to name but one... so any advice/tips
    would be greatly welcomed (i.e font combinations) \r\nThanks v. much for the feedback
    so far.\r\n\r\nP.S Love your Whitman font Kent... Will be def keeping it in mind
    for future work. "

  body: "Hi, jarbinson,\r\n\r\nI think you might give a second thought to PF Centro
    (aka PF Agora). It has three families: <a href=\"http://www.parachute.gr/fonts.aspx?Sample=1&FontStyleID=&FontFamilyID=7&CharacterSetID=12\">Sans
    Pro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.parachute.gr/fonts.aspx?Sample=1&FontStyleID=&FontFamilyID=18&CharacterSetID=38\">Serif
    Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.parachute.gr/fonts.aspx?Sample=1&FontStyleID=&FontFamilyID=19&CharacterSetID=39\">Slab
    Pro</a>. But what doesn't make it an optimal choice is its price: the total price
    of the 3 families is 1615EURO=625 EURO(Sans Pro)+365 EURO(Serif Pro)+625EURO(Slab
    Pro)\r\n\r\nCompared to PF Centro, A complete Stag family is only priced at 750USD
    (at Village's online store)\r\n\r\nI hope PF Centro can be a good alternative
    for you, depsite its high price.:-)\r\n\r\nJZ"
