  could anyone shed some light on the typefaces used in this logo? I've drawn a blank.\r\n\r\nThe
  M seems to be from another typeface entirely, it reminded me of Peignot but it's
  not.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!"

    seems\r\nlike another case of massive font forgery,\r\nas there are many fonts
    very close to your logo design \r\nbut no one comes from a recognized legitimate
    source\r\n(i.e. most of the following \"copyright owners\" \r\nare well known
    for their font forgeries):\r\n\r\n<strong>New York Bold</strong>\r\n(c) => \"\xA9
    1995-2001 Arts & Letters\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Fox Trot</strong>\r\n(c) => \"From the
    WSI-Font Collection.  Copyright (c)1993 W.S.I.\"\r\n(c) => \"(c) 1991 by Tom C.
    Lai\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Orlando</strong>\r\n(c) => \"Freeware!\"\r\n\r\n<strong>CadizSCapsSSK
