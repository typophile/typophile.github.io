  body: Are you planning to use this font for hot metal or for digital. <BR> <BR>OK
    - just a joke. <BR> <BR>I like it. I am curious about some of the elements that
    form the &#39;flourishes&#39;. What was your reasoning behind how these elements?

  body: I like it &#40;though the name was intriguing at first--and not in a good
    way&#41;. <BR>Do you have a PDF specimen where we can see more details?

  body: Hello, Mike.   <BR>That type intends to use in some graphic materials, flyers,
    posters etc...   <BR>The decorations I was inspired by some dirty types of old
    plates that could research.   <BR>Actually I found many types similar to F&#42;CK
    YOU LAS VEGAS in graves of some cemeteries. Give all inspiration it appeared.   <BR>Thank
    you! <BR> <BR>Marcio

  body: Hello, Marius <BR>With relationship to the name went only to decide in using
    F&#42;CK YOU LAS VEGAS, because of some plates that I used as inspiration, full
    of ornaments, and writing the name F&#42;CK YOU LAS VEGAS found very interesting
    the drawing, I used the useful and the pleasant, hehehehehe.   <BR>I will provide
    PDF, the characters are not all complete ones, more I am going you to order.   <BR>Thankful.
