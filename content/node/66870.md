  body: "Well, I didn't find anything too close under the SciFi category, but on the
    Techno>Various category I found [[http://www.dafont.com/sony-sketch-ef.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ICARVE|Sony
    Sketch]]. If you combine part of the F with the R you can get this R and just
    flip the V for this A.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    A before somewhere - perhaps a rip-off though. I'll give your suggestion a try.\r\n\r\nTrudy"

  body: "That's understandable, because many techno fonts use an A like your sample,
    but I would not be surprised if many of them are just flipped V's. The reason
    I am not fond of \"Techno\" as a style is that there are so many fonts that look
    like one another. If most designers think 'techno' means reducing letterforms
    to simple lines and curves, it stands to reason that many of the alphabets they
    produce will be mind-numbingly similar, and they are. \r\n\r\nConsidering the
    number of fonts that could be called Techno, I think the percentage that show
    any real design artistry is quite small. Just my opinion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree with you 100%. \r\n\r\nI do find far too many fonts \"running into
    to each other\" and so many designers who want to \"hack a font\" just to make
    it look different. \r\n\r\nI was able to re-create the logo using your suggestions
    with the exception of the R, it required a bit more cutting. But I'm happy with
    what I came up with.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was my first experience here at typophile.com,
    and I am very impressed with the response.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help &
    insights.\r\n\r\nTrudy"
