  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My thirteen year old daughter is interested enough in fonts to be proud of having gone to the NY MoMA Helvetica exhibition, likes Gill Sans,  can spot Arial from Helvetica at ten paces and howls at the ubiquitous use of Comic Sans in schools.  I'm a computer security guy, but I pored over Letraset catalogues as a child thirty-plus years ago and have an amateur's interest in design, although I do all my own documents with LaTeX.

Since we cut all the household document work over onto Pages, my daughter's been using one of the templates that sets the body of her essays in Gill Sans.  Occasionally teachers say to the class ``and I want it in Arial'' but she reckons that means ``enough of the bloody Comic Sans already'' and keeps using Gill Sans, and no-one has complained yet.  If a teacher did complain, she'd switch to Helvetica Neue: if they spot the difference between that and Arial it'd be a miracle, but the extra beauty of the real thing is probably worth a few marks.

Today, however, she asked me if there was a font that would be acceptable for school use for running text, easy to read, but wasn't Helvetica or Gill Sans.  `Her' font, if you will.  And that doesn't look anything remotely like Times New Roman, which is apparently `geeky' --- I take that to rule out serifed fonts.  Apparently the art teacher is interested in type and my daughter wants to impress her.

So, if you wanted a sans-serif font that's easy on the eye, legible, works well at 10--12pt as body text on fairly long lines, what you would use?  I own copies of Frutiger and Univers 55, but the former doesn't seem to sit quite right for body text and the latter isn't really distinctive from Helvetica/Arial in small sizes.  Any thoughts?

		<div class="commentbody">It's not clear whether you're prepared to license a professional-grade font for your grade-school daughter (bravo! if you are), but if you're looking for something Gill-Sans-but-not-Gill-Sans, you and she might take a look at Jeremy Tankard's [[http://www.typography.net/type/font/bliss|Bliss]] or Greg Thompson's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda|Agenda]].

At the very least, downloading some PDF samples and exploring the differences together could be a fun educational activity.</div>

You could also consider buying [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesans/thesans/|The Sans]] from Mr Luc(as) de Groot. It has one of the prettiest lowercase g letters out there. Overall a very nice and accessible typeface. It is also a favourite of some non-designers I know. Basically everyone likes it.
