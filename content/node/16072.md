  body: "By \"vertical rectangle containing the entire font and with the install button
    below\" do you mean the Font Book preview window that opens when you double click
    on a font file? Fonts are installed in one of the Library directories, either
    the system-wide one at [startup volume name]/Library/Fonts/, the user one at ~/Library/Fonts/,
    or, if you want the fonts available in Classic applications, [startup volume name]/System
    Folder/Fonts/. Which one is used depends on a preference in Font Book.\r\n\r\nOlder
    Macintosh font files don't have any standard file extension (e.g., .ttf). Instead,
    they have four-character file type signatures (a.k.a. meta data) in the file itself.
    PostScript Type one fonts consist of two files, a \"suitcase\" file with the file
    type of FFIL and the PS outline file with the font type of LWFN. Macintosh TrueType
    fonts consist of a single \"suitcase\" file with the file type of SFNT. File extensions
    are sometimes added to suitcase files, such as .bmap or .suit, but these are simply
    a naming convention and mean nothing to the OS.\r\n\r\nSince the advent of OS
    X, with its UNIX underpinning, file extensions are used in some cases in addition
    or instead of the traditional Macintosh file types. Some newer kinds of font files
    have extensions such as .dfont (a special version of the old Mac TrueType format
    used only by low level UNIX stuff), .otf (crossplatform OpenType fonts), and .ttf
    (Windows TrueType fonts, which also work in OS X, and may also be OpenType fonts)."

  body: "Mark\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughtful and thorough reply.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    I am using OS 10.4.2 (I have no OS 9 anymore) on an iMac G5.  I am not talking
    about Font Book, as my external backup records only a blank from Font Book.  What
    I have on my Macintosh Hard Drive is 1) Library>Fonts>Font Book,  2) System>Library>Fonts>Font
    Book and User>>Library>Fonts>Blank.  I swear I used to have a folder containing
    the orignal separate installations for each font, and that I had that folder backed
    up.  Is this only an OS 9 memory?  \r\n\r\nNow after my old computer and old external
    backup drive, both, burned out, plus switching backup software three times, I
    find all I had backed up in a \"Fonts\" folder is blank space.  \r\n\r\nIn my
    attempt to find the possibly deleted original font installs on my present backup
    drive, I thought maybe I could identify them from their file type.  But, from
    what you have discribed to me, none of the files recovered contain font installs.\r\n\r\nI
    want very much at least to backup certain old Macintosh OS 9 fonts that are no
    longer available (plus some fonts I have purchased).  How can I effectively back
    them up from Font Book?\r\n\r\nReddaddy "

  body: "The smart thing to do (if it's not too late) would be to burn your font library
    to CD as a back-up.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to tell you in regards to recovering
    the fonts you have lost. In the case of fonts you bought, you may be able to ask
    the foundry or distributor for replacements, especially if you have some kind
    of record of the purchase. I have done this myself for customers, but not all
    foundries or distributors will do this, and some charge extra for the service.\r\n\r\nWith
    old Apple fonts, you may be able to find them online. I don't know of a source,
    off hand."
