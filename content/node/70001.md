  at the typefaces you find on the round ink postage stamps (do they have a different
  name to normal paper stamps?) - in particular these:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post_Card__Envelope_2_3504.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post_Card__Envelope_3_6220.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post_Card__Envelope_4_4700.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows what they are or knows of anything similar I would really appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJordan"

    cancellation stamps. These are too old to be 'fonts' in the sense of something
    you put on your computer. I couldn't find fonts made to look like this exactly,
    but <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-stamp-gothic/\">FF Stamp
    Gothic</a> might make a close substitute.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is also a good choice for the narrow text in the center of the postmark, though
    the numerals are perhaps not quite right.'
