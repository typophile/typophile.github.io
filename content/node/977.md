  I haven&#39;t been able to find anything better. We&#39;ve only got Quark right

  <BR> <BR>Thanks so much to everyone who gave advice on the last thread I started.

  body: <i>&#62;The wonderful Whitman is a book face; its x-height  <BR>is too small
    for news setting.</i> <BR> <BR>I have to agree. Whitman would not be well suited
    for  <BR>news. Given some of its roots in Scotch forms, however,  <BR>I have wondered
    if it couldn&#39;t be reconfigured for  <BR>newspaper work. I have sketches somewhere
    that I  <BR>started a while back to adapt the proportions to news --  <BR>much
    taller x-height and shorter extenders, narrower  <BR>overall, etc.  <BR> <BR>But
    that is on a back burner and may never come to  <BR>any fruition. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    personally a great admirer of both Charter and  <BR>Swift. Understatement and
    neutrality are generally  <BR>good qualities in a news face. These two might not  <BR>work
    in commercial newspaper circumstances, but I  <BR>think they might serve well
    in a school paper.  <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: '&#62; narrower overall <BR> <BR>Kent, I&#39;ve come to the -admittedly counterintuitive,
    and somewhat tentative- conclusion that narrowness is an illusional virtue in
    a news face. When you take into account the frequent linebreaks in news setting
    &#40;and possible a negative effect in apparent size&#41;, it turns out that it
    might in fact backfire&#42;. So the choice of width in a news face has more to
    do with the atmosphere you want to convey than economy. I&#39;m talking about
    body here, not headings, where horizontal economy is of obvious benefit. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Does this jive with what the FB experts have told you? <BR> <BR>Also,
    when you pull in the extenders you automatically create a perception of width.
    When I was deriving Patria from Harrier, I ended up with a much more squat and
    masculine design than I expected, or even originally wanted. I&#39;m lucky I ended
    up liking it like that!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>In the case of Whitman, it depends on
    the atmosphere you want to convey. If you want it wide/homey &#40;which to me
    fits well&#41; rather than narrow/elegant, chances are just pulling in the extenders
    is enough. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#62;the &#34;stateliness&#34; conveyed by its narrowness <BR> <BR>Actually,
    Worldwide might be a bit too condensed to work with Gotham, which is quite squat
    and wide looking. However, it could work with Gotham Condensed. But really, it&#39;s
    tough to know till you actually start playing around. There are so many typographic
    parameters that a designer can fiddle with these days in news design -- a huge
    difference from the rigid restrictions of the pre-digital era. <BR> <BR>A few
    years ago, North American web presses went narrower, causing all kinds of design
    problems for news designers, who generally responded by going to narrower faces.
    So there is definitely a &#34;semi-condensed&#34; look to the genre -- but of
    course we don&#39;t know where Zach is is heading in relation to the trend.'

  body: '&#62;Soft and populist, now we&#39;re getting somewhere.  <BR>&#62;Question:
    do you think something like the new  <BR>&#62;LA Times body face is too homey
    for you?  <BR> <BR>I must confess I haven&#39;t seen it... I haven&#39;t found
    a bookstore that carries more than the basic Boston/NY papers plus some international
    ones. And a few minutes searching the internet yielded no high-res images. <BR>
    <BR>Sorry, I had meant to answer you about the demographic and viewpoint of the
    paper earlier but forgot. Gordon is a private, religious, liberal-arts college
    -- officially &#34;evangelical&#34;, which is a kind of catch-all term for conservative
    Protestants. The student body however is more diverse than that, with both very
    liberal and very conservative Christians, and many non-Christians as well, &#40;though
    that&#39;s rarely talked about&#41;. <BR> <BR>So handling the demographic is tricky:
    wheras a national newspaper can carve out its niche in the political spectrum,
    we probably have a more complex range of readers to serve. The task would be easy
    if a garden variety, conservative evangelical Protestant had gotten the editorship:
    you just select and deliver the news from that point of view, and basically preserve
    the Gordon status quo. But I&#39;m more of a progressive pseudo-Christian &#40;a
    Quaker to be precise&#41;, so I have to think really hard about how to balance
    my views with what the Gordon community would prefer to hear. For example, we
    will probably publicize the nasty things done by some the companies Gordon is
    invested in, though it will probably make many people upset. <BR> <BR>And though
    we will be pretty leftist, I don&#39;t want us to be either shrill &#40;trying
    to find common ground whenever possible&#41; or alarmist &#40;talking about important
    social issues, sure, but not trying to put everyone in a perpetual state of moral
    outrage&#41;. So a simple and gentle typeface might reflect that well. '
