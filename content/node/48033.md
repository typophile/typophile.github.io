body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm starting work on a small annual report for a nonprofit
  focused on education in North America. For the past few years, I've used the fantastic
  [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html | Locator]] and
  Locator Display by Process. This year, I'd like to use the Display face again but
  invest in a nice serifed font for text. It would be great if the new font will belong
  to a larger family of typefaces, but it's not necessary. The primary goal is to
  have a text face that will be friendly and super legible but will also share some
  of the modern quirks of Locator in a very gentle way. It should not call overt attention
  to itself and it should be a bit of a workhorse.\r\n\r\nI've somewhat ruled out
  Meta Serif but I'm considering [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_complete_vp/
  | Mendoza ]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/mokka/ | Mokka]] as
  these are smartly crafted transitional faces. There's also [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032
  | Chronicle]], which is lovely.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be welcome! Thanks,
  in advance."

  body: "Bert,\r\n\r\nGreat suggestion. I'm a big fan of the KLIM typefaces and I
    saw Newzald when it came out. The only issue is that the x-height is a bit large
    relative to Locator, I think.  I do like how it reads at 12/15...\r\n\r\nAB"
