  a business card and logo to drum up new business. I have since tried to base my
  other materials on that card (well, other materials being my website and invoices)
  and I'm now considering revising and putting more thought into my needs -- I'm a
  one-man studio working in print, logo, and interactive design.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here
  are samples of my current business card and invoice, as well as <a href=\"http://addisonhalldesign.com\">my
  website</a>. I'd like other professional opinions as to whether or not I should
  proceed with changing or live with what I have. Any and all suggestions are welcome.
  Thanks."

    by the online presence. You've created a wonderful feeling of trust and professionalism,
    through the efficient use of type, image, and color. (And solid verbiage.)\r\n\r\nI
    really like your logowork, most of all the fenceworks logo. :)\r\n\r\nThe only
    thing that stood out was the picture of yourself, and the inclusion of your child.
    I have two kids so I understand the pride of being a father. But in my very humble
    opinion, I don't think that you need a kid picture. To me, it makes it seem like
    you are juggling design while changing diapers. And maybe you are. Some clients
    might like that, others may not. I'm sure others have a differing opinion on this.
    Anyway, that is my only quibble in what is an otherwise fantastic print/online
    combo. Congrats!"

    compliments!\r\n\r\nI agree about the photograph -- I had honestly forgotten about
    it (it was previously me and my dog...). The family photos should probably be
    restricted to my personal site."
