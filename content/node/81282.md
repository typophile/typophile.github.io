  body: " <cite>It could well be a military modelling font<cite>\r\n\r\nExcuse me,
    I don't understand this sentence. As far as I know, there are not ''military modelling
    fonts''.\r\nI asked if you knew about some font set resembling (even a little
    bit!) this one depicted.\r\nIf anybody knows, it is ok.\r\nThank you anyway.\r\n"
