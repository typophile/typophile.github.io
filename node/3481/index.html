<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>How big should the "-mark" symbols be in a font? <br> <br>Many fonts have the trademark and copyright mark at full cap height. Others have the Registered mark as a superior. <br> <br>But surely this is a mistake, because while it makes sense in the main text, if a typographer then has to set the character in an accompanying footnote, it becomes the size of a fly dropping, and too small to decipher without a magnifying glass. <br> <br>What's your experience? <br> <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think the copyright mark should match the numerals in vertical span, while the registered and trademark should be floating to the height of the caps (but not too small). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The contrary argument is that at display sizes, the registered and trademark need to be even smaller than the main text. <br> <br>In general, copyright is supposed to align with the body text, and registered and trademark symbols should be superiors; that is, about 1/3 of their size above the cap height, and 2/3 below, with the overall size being considerably smaller than the cap size. (How much smaller being dependent on both the weight of the font and the intended average point size of usage.) <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>>the intended average point size of usage <br> <br>But in practice that will vary: <br> <br>In my experience designing ads, flyers, and marketing newsletters, the Registered symbol is used in body text (size 8 - 14 pt) as a superscript to a brand name. <br> <br>Then it is repeated in a footnote (with the name of the owner of the brand) as small as possible, (4 - 6 pt). <br> <br>I always prefer it when fonts have a cap-height Registered symbol, because it is easy to "superscript" the symbol in the body copy, but very difficult to increase the size of a pre-shrunk symbol in the footnote and not have it look too bold and misaligned vertically. If you just set it straight, it's but a speck. <br> <br>That's why I make cap height Reg symbols in the fonts I design, unless they are outright display faces. <br> <br>However, I seem to be going against the flow here, so I would like to confirm with typographers: <br>Do you prefer a pre-shrunk Registered symbol in your text fonts? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Another thing to consider is the weight problem. I almost always go up one weight (if possible) when I use a super-shift version of the TM or R. Perhaps if you choose to go with the full-size method, you can increase the weight a bit? I don't know what other consequences you might run into if you choose that option. <br> <br>Here at Gigantacorp, we often redraw fonts for the circulars for superior numbers and special characters. By the time we get to the redrawing stage, we already know what size range we will be needing and therefore can make the "right" choice in adjusting "r-balls" and "tms" in size, weight and positioning. <br> <br>Digression: Does anyone else call them "r-balls"?

<div class=commentbody>That's a big problem, that the weight and optical size is all wrong if one simply scales the mark to the desired size. <br> <br>This is an area that screams for a sensitive optical size treatment, with *much* smaller registered and TM symbols at large display sizes, and pretty big ones for small print. <br> <br>If you don't have separate optical sizes of the typeface, one could also include different size versions of the R/TM as alternates.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody><i>How far should the mark match the style of the typeface -- in particular, why do most italic fonts have roman marks?</i> <br> <br>The answer, as always, is: it depends. <br> <br>I have strongly suspected that some sloppy font producers throw in a generic humanist "r-ball" or "tm" on any font they create. To me, it's an obvious error if the R in the registration mark doesn't bear a strong resemblance to the R in the typeface it "modifies." <br> <br>The "depends" part deals with condensing and/or obliqueing the circle along with the R inside the circle. That's just wrong! Keep the circle round. Then condense or oblique (if you have to, but you really should re-draw) the R within the circle. <br> <br>Of course, after I've gone through the process of doing all that, the effect can be so distracting that I throw the end product out and default to the roman registration mark. Italic Rs within a circle sometimes look silly. Italic TMs sometimes look silly. <b>Avoid silly.</b> <br> <br>Thomas, I agree with Gerald -- providing alternate versions is a great solution -- I'd be tempted to provide a version set at x-height as well. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>In the metal type days, fonts did not come with matching registered, trademark, or copyright symbols. These were purchased separately in a range of sizes and had generic designs. They came in only serif or sans serif if there was any choice--no condensed, bold or italics. Phototypesetting fonts were similarly limited. The idea of having these characters match the font is a recent development and one that seems not to have been completely worked out yet.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Haha. <br> <br>I was inspired by Shel Silverstein (I think it was (if it wasn't I can't pretend to know whom it might have been (someone will correct me if it's not))) who wrote an entire short story/poem with nested parenthesis (not brackets (I think he was going for a visual effect (or better yet, maybe he was going for a cognitive overload (for the reader, not for himself))) which would change the overall texture). It was great. (I'm sure he probably drove his proof readers mad. (Who wants a dagger now?)) <br> <br>(This makes for a great way to write a stream of conscience without having to stop to make it all grammatically nice.) <br> <br>(Isn't someone going to call "off topic" soon?) <br> <br>(Who was it that said you can skip anything written in parenthesis?)</div>
