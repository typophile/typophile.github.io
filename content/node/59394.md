    for and let applications throw in .notdef on the off chance someone tries to typeset
    equations with my fonts?"

  body: "Similar to the UnicodeRange fields, the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#cpr|OpenType
    spec]] is pretty vague on this:\r\n<cite>If the bit is set (1) then the code page
    is considered functional. If the bit is clear (0) then the code page is not considered
    functional. Each of the bits is treated as an independent flag and the bits can
    be set in any combination. The determination of \u201Cfunctional\u201D is left
    up to the font designer, although character set selection should attempt to be
    functional by code pages if at all possible. </cite>\r\n\r\nOur practice has been
    to only set a given bit if *all* characters from the code page are present, except
    in the case when no code pages have all characters: then the Latin-1 bit is set.
    I am not sure whether it is still the case but I think this practice goes back
    to a recommendation by Microsoft for correct functionality under Windows...must
    have at least one CP bit set."

  body: 'There is a bug or "feature" in some of the older versions of InDesign for
    Windows. If you don''t set Central European Latin 2 codepage for fonts containing
    CE characters, you won''t be available to type CE characters using your keyboard,
    although you will be able to apply the font on a text containing CE glyphs. I
    didn''t test this issue with CS4 yet. '
