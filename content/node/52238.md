  current brief I have been set out to find examples of where this typeface has been
  used.\r\n\r\nI have found the common Morrisons offers and Ups logo, and also the
  recent Don't Blink campain in this months Focus mag. But I was wondering if anyone
  knew of a higher level of design it has been put into. If it be the main face or
  a subordinate face.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks in advance, and I look forward to your replies.
  \r\n\r\nAsh"
