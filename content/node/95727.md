  body: Probably not a font at all. Like most newspaper nameplates, this is a custom
    design, loosely based (as are some other newspaper nameplates) on the general
    forms found in [[http://typoface.blogspot.com/2008/10/newspaper-titles-what-on-earth-is-this.html|Engravers
    Old English]].   It's possible that someone has created a font based on those
    few letters, much as Carter has created and used "Fraktur Six"  for internal use
    at the New York Times.
