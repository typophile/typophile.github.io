  believe the lettering on this truck is the same if you want a better look. It is
  part of the same company[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sky_5314.jpg]"

  body: "If the web page lettering is Myriad (and it's too hard to tell from those
    letters at that size), the truck lettering certainly isn't Myriad. I thought <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/roycole/colophon/\">Colophon</a> was close,
    but the i-dot would need modifying.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
