body: "Hi...\r\n\r\nI'm new to NYC from Boston. I'm looking for a print shop (not
  a broker) who can affordably and reliably print very simple 1 and 2 color jobs.\r\n\r\nThis
  shop shouldn't be a big printshop, but it should be capable of doing a great job
  on thick, uncoated paper-- I'm looking to have a few notebook covers and greeting
  cards I've designed printed up. No fancy stuff- no engraving or foil. Just great
  color on paper. I really don't want to go with a .com printer for this, considering
  I'd like to pick my own paper (100% PC recycled...) and PMS.\r\n\r\nI'll also look
  into 4/c digital as these are pretty short runs...max 2000 pcs.\r\n\r\nIf there
  are any designers out there who can offer advice, I would really be grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much! \r\n\r\nOh--if you want to see any samples of the type of work I'm trying
  to print up, you can see them on my flickr acct. here\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/10199499@N05/sets/72157600884535896/\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSusy\r\n"

  body: "Hey Ricardo...I will also check them out.\r\n\r\nthe lexicon people are more
    brokers than a print shop and I am looking to go direct if possible.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole collection is meant to be really eco friendly...so, that's a great tip.
    Thank you!\r\n\r\nsusy"

  body: "update...\r\n\r\ncalled up Rolling Press and was really pleased.\r\n\r\nNot
    only do they do small run jobs, but they buy into cartons of 100% PCW paper (even
    in heavy weights--- Mohawk Options is their house sheet and it goes up to 130#
    double thick cover). \r\n\r\nVery attentive and personable on the phone...got
    bids back and the price is right.\r\n\r\nlooks like I'll be going with them. Thanks!"
