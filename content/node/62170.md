  body: I don't recall seeing it in any specimen books. Don't see anything like it
    in Solo or P-L. Might have been custom.

    dunk to draw by hand, even in 1973. '

    this one is a typeface, I'd guess that the other one is as well (but anything's
    possible)."

  body: "I would say the same about that one. The zig-zag pattern is different in
    the two \"res\" sequences, but that is probably because it was added after the
    letters were assembled/set/drawn. It's possible this was a film font, but definitely
    not a wood typeface because of the top of the \"b\". It wouldn't have been designed
    like that.\r\n\r\nI remember listening to this album in college. Really good,
    as I recall. Better than their later stuff."
