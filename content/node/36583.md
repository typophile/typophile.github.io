body: "I just downloaded a font \u2013 FreightSans \u2013 and noticed to my horror
  that the following Danish characters \u2013 \xE6\xF8\xE5, \xC6\xD8\xC5 \u2013 aren't
  where they're supposed to be. I can see in the character setting, that they are
  there, but when I press the \xC6\xD8\xC5 characters on my keyboard I get something
  like \xCA_  \xC2. \r\n\r\nWhen I look in the detailed view in FontExplorer and press
  on one of the mentioned characters I can see that they not assigned to any keystroke,
  but only have glyph ID's, so that's a little weird.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mentioned
  characters come out fine when I set a sample on the Joshua Darden website, so what's
  going wrong?  I have the truetype version on a mac. Other truetype fonts work fine,
  so I don't thing it's related to the format.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I can
  do? I've also written to Joshua Dardens site, but I'm guessing you guys in here
  are faster."

  body: "I just managed to type the mentioned glyphs correctly in InDesign with Finnish
    keyboard (CS2/mac). Are all the other fonts behaving all right?\r\n\r\nDid you
    buy the font from the man himself or from a dealer? I had a little problem with
    one of the glyphs after purchasing from an online font shop. Mr Darden replaced
    the files promptly, the dealer had had an old buggy version of the font."

    time, but because it could be educational, whether it's a font glitch or user
    error.\r\n\r\n(If I were to hazard a guess, he's on a Mac, the font is OpenType
    CFF, and it's another case of the bizarre Apple-encoding-glyphs-by-name-instead-of-cmap-table
    issue. It's bitten us at Adobe, too.)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    My magazine is looking so much better today!\r\n\r\nFor the record all other fonts
    were \"behaving all right\" and the format was TrueType. The new version I received
    is also TrueType."
