  body: '"An Empire" is an old face called Rustikalis. Not sure if there is a digital
    version. "Forever" seems to be a modified version of Times Roman. Edit: Times
    Semibold, more precisely.'

  body: The Rustikalis you seek is the Bold. The only digital version of Rustikalis
    at all that I'm aware of is David Rakowski's <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/IN20111"
    target="_blank">Durango</a> - which only offers the regular weight.
