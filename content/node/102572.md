  together for the past 2 years and so far have been using this logo. We wanted some
  professional input and would really appreciate your constructive criticism. This
  logo came about when one of my friends younger cousin drew up a sketched logo and
  we inked it in photoshop. From looking at the other logo critiques on this forum
  I can tell your feedback can be very beneficial. \r\n\r\nBackground about the group:\r\nThree
  23 year old African American women who met at the University of Florida while majoring
  in Mass Communications. \r\n\r\nTypes of Videos we do:\r\nAdvertisements, Weddings,
  Short Films, Events, Documentaries. We love it all. Most of our videos so far have
  been targeted towards the African American Community. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you
  need anymore info!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Emarjaylogotransparent_6167.png]"

  body: "Hi Ash, welcome to Typophile. \r\n\r\nMy first thought is to wonder whether
    it's appropriate to have \"Films\" in the name and to show an image of film, since
    film is on the way out and you're shooting video. \r\n\r\nRegarding the logo itself,
    it's unconventional and amateurish (sorry), but there's something about it that
    makes me smile; a sense of joy and maybe whimsy. I'm not sure if that's good or
    not; a lot would depend on how you're marketing yourself. If you want to look
    a bit unconventional and different and are doing mostly smaller projects, maybe
    an unconventional logo would work fine. But if you're trying to get corporate
    work, you might want something more conventional and professional.\r\n\r\nIf you
    want to keep the same general look that you're showing, I'd try using solid areas
    of color (or color gradients) rather than doing everything in outline, and I'd
    have a graphic designer redraw it to clean it up. I'd probably try to make the
    woman in the center the focal point, by perhaps making her a tad larger and making
    the highest part of the film strip in the center rather than on the left. I'd
    also make the title larger; maybe one word above the image and one below. Regarding
    the font, I'll let others who are more expert in that area make suggestions. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way, there's nothing about it that makes me think \"African American\". I
    only mention that because you mentioned it in your post, and I'm not sure if you
    want your logo to communicate that."

  body: That is a thought. I think we just liked the way it sounded together. And
    no offense taken we are trying to take a step towards the professional world one
    thing at a time. We are looking to go corporate eventually and I can tell simple
    and to the point logos are the way to go. We don't have to keep the same look
    because I Feel like we are still working on our brand! =)

    working on our brand! \r\n\r\nOkay, and in fact most companies change or update
    their logos periodically.\r\n\r\nMaybe some folks here will have suggestions for
    new logo directions, but my suggestion would be to team up with a good graphic
    designer who can meet with you, learn about your business, your future goals,
    your competition, and then he/she can develop a new logo for you. If money is
    tight maybe you could do a trade and swap some video work for developing a new
    logo. \r\n\r\nI see you're in the Tampa area and I'm sure there are numerous good
    designers in that area. (You could also work with an out-of-town designer via
    phone and email, but I've always felt I could size up people better when I meet
    them in person.) Look at their portfolios (especially logos), talk to them, get
    names of some recent clients you can contact for references, get a written estimate,
    etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    got some good stuff to work with. You're African Americans, there's 3 of you and
    from what I can gather from the illustration Emarjay Films is a celebration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    a strong monogram of M.R.J. could work but I'd would explore all options. Just
    be sure that whatever you develop that it's strong ...and that there is a proper
    visual hierarchy.\r\n\r\n "
