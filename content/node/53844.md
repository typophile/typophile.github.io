  research? Basically I am looking at social implications of typography, type psychology
  and typographic associations, I would appreciate both design and non-design points
  of view if available. \r\n\r\nUltimately I would like to (after extensive research)
  create a typeface (hopefully more than one) based off of this research. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions as to where to begin? \r\n\r\nI can be reached via email:\r\n\r\ncolin.trechter@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nColin

  body: I've looked into graphology long ago, and that could be one place to get some
    inpiration from. Good luck.

  body: I don't remember where the link is, but there is a recent slide show somewhere
    on the web showing famous typefaces and their personality types. Maybe someone
    can chime in with that link. Its basic and comical, but does have some logic behind
    it.

  body: "Michael Brady (or was it John Langdon?) had an article in an issue of Baseline
    magazine about font \"personalities\", but -I presume like the slideshow Stephen
    mentions- it was largely subjective. Ovink and Javal* were scientists (among other
    things) who used empirical methods (which is not to say their results can be trusted
    blindly, especially since their work is ~50 and ~100 years old respectively, and
    font perceptions change).\r\n\r\n* And more recently possibly Kevin Larson.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>...it was largely subjective. Ovink and Javal* were scientists (among
    other things) who used empirical methods...</em>\r\n\r\nEmpirical methodology
    can be used to measure subjective responses, which is what has been done with
    'personality' responses to different typefaces. You get a bunch of people, show
    them a bunch of typefaces, record what 'personalities' they assign to each, and
    then look for significant response patterns, e.g. most of the people saying Comic
    Sans is 'playful'.\r\n\r\nThe trouble I have with this kind of study isn't that
    the responses are subjective, but that there is no effort to discover <em>why</em>
    a particular typeface is assigned a particular personality, which means that the
    study doesn't know what it is studying: is the personality in some way inherent
    in the typeface, or is it associated with the use of that typeface in e.g. advertising?"

  body: "Typefaces are like actors.\r\nSome can play many personalities, others only
    themselves.\r\nSome get typecast.\r\nAs far as choosing types goes, art directors
    are more like casting directors; working with type, more like movie directors.
    \r\n\r\nIn as much as a good man can play a bad man, it's pointless to speak of
    the \"psychology\" of a typeface in the abstract.\r\nWhat matters is the performance."
