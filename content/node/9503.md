    and <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/">Gotham</a>. Does that
    sound good?

  body: 'Yes, &#34;FameLab&#34; is Helvetica, as is your most recent sample. And Justin
    is right: the &#34;acta...theatre&#34; sample is Gotham. <BR> <BR>&#40;Raph, I
    had the same impression when I first saw the American edition of GQ using Gotham,
    before it went public -- I wondered where they&#39;d gotten a custom version of
    Avenir.&#41;'

  body: 'Marc: Gotham does rock. <BR> <BR>The &#39;a&#39; in &#39;Made&#39; doesn&#39;t
    quite match Helvetica, but the comma screams it. I&#39;m not sure exactly what
    we&#39;re looking at, but it&#39;s probably one of the many Helvetica clones/remakes.
    It&#39;s equally plausible they filed off the mini-tail to make it connect visually
    with the &#39;i&#39; on the next line. Either way, it&#39;s very &#39;70s looking.'
