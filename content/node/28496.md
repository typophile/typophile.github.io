    exaclty call them comprehensive, but good references nonetheless...\r\n\r\nAlso

  body: "\"The Zen of CSS Design\" is a must-read if you want to learn to use CSS.
    Shea and Holzshcag are about as good as it gets when it comes to CSS, and since
    most browsers still haven't finished CSS 2 support (and IE never will) the book
    hasn't gone out of date.\r\n\r\nThe best comprehensive CSS reference that I've
    found is O'Reilly's \"Web Design in Nutshell, 3rd Edition.\" It covers just about
    every bit of the HTML/XHTML/CSS standards, explaining how they work and how to
    integrate them. It's not the kind of book you read cover-to-cover and learn from,
    but when you need to know something in a hurry, there just is no better option.
    Combine this one with the \"Zen\" book and you're set.\r\n"

  body: "If you buy just one book, I'd recommend CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards
    Solutions by Andy Budd. It has a couple introductory chapters, then has several
    devoted to specific topics, such as styling menus and doing multi-column layout.
    (This makes it a useful reference, albeit not necessarily comprehensive.) Then
    the last two chapters are case studies by Cameron Moll and Simon Collison that
    put many of the best techniques into practice.\r\nhttp://www.cssmastery.com/\r\n\r\nI
    also recommend Eric Meyer (EM on CSS, More EM on CSS, and Definitive Guide) and
    Jeffrey Zeldman (Designing with Web Standards; make sure you get the new 2nd edition).
    The EM on CSS books are mostly tutorials. Zeldman is like CSS mastery but more
    introductory and, in my opinion, has too much web standards advocacy and not enough
    in-depth design."

      out the markup and CSS of a site you like and see how it works in practice.\r\n\r\nI
      did that with the blogs of Doug Bowman (www.stopdesign.com) and Khoi Vinh (www.subtraction.com).
      Guess I had good taste, as they are now the design leaders at Google and the
      New York Times.\r\n"

  body: "I recommend <a href=\"http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764588338.html\">Professional
    CSS</a>. It's written in such a way that geeks and novices can understand, and
    there are plenty of examples online that it references. (Some have moved, such
    as the 2005 PGA Tour site, but you can still find them.) There's a sense of humor
    throughout.\r\n\r\nLet me add this: if you're new to CSS, it should be a fairly
    easy concept to understand if you're already familiar with the idea of using style
    sheets in page layout software such as QuarkXPress or InDesign.  (Now I wish the
    page layout programs handled things other than just type in their style sheets!
    Why can't style sheets also affect images and placement?)\r\n\r\nI also recommend
    <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com\">A List Apart</a> as an excellent resource
    for anything CSS or interactive. It's also been a source of ideas for print as
    well, in terms of approaches to problem-solving."
