body: I am using Kaiti SC in InDesign. When I try to create a PDF or Package the finished
  product, I receive the error message saying the font could not be embedded due to
  licensing restrictions. The font is NOT restricted and can be embedded. I am using
  Mac with InDesign CS6.  Any thoughts on a work around will be greatly appreciated
  as I have 78 pages of copy using this ttc.  :(

    then you might want to contact Apple. If it is embeddable you probably want to
    check with Adobe. It's possible that there's something about the font that InDesign's
    PDF export doesn't like. Does it work with other TTCs?   \r\n"

  body: FYI, on a relatively new mac, the version of Kaiti SC (8.0d1e2; 2012-06-20)
    (8,079 characters) which is part of OS X install is DEFINITELY RESTRICTED. However,
    when Creative Suite 6 is installed, Adobe installs "5.016;ADBE;AdobeKaitiStd-Regular;ADOBE"
    (30,610 characters) which IS NOT RESTRICTED. The only downside (I think) of the
    Adobe Creative Suite version is that Bold and Black weights are not provided (I
    am not familiar with Chinese characters, so I'm not sure whether this is important
    or not).

    I think you are right in that Apple has messed up with this one somehow because
    Font Book definitely says it is embeddable.  It is very strange that you could
    create a PDF using TextEdit but InDesign refuses to embed it.  I presume Adobe
    are more wary of copyright infringement and hence check into the metadata more
    thoroughly?\r\n\r\nOobimichael, I have an early 2012 MacBook Air bought in Malaysia,
    so it does not seem to be an EU specific issue.  'Black' and 'Bold' are an important
    part of my document, which is why Adobe's Creative Suit version of the font is
    not suitable for this project.\r\n\r\nIn doing some research online, it seems
    there is an Apple Thai font (Thonburi) that has caused similar problems.\r\n\r\nThis
    thread http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2007/11/os-x-105-leopard-fixing-thai.html discusses
    the font and its problems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am in China and the Government

    Dov Isaacs, Nov 16, 2009 12:42 PM   in reply to wvperegrine Report\r\nJeff,\r\n
    \r\n(1)     There was absolutely no change in how InDesign (or any other Adobe
    application) embeds fonts between CS3 and CS4. In fact, InDesign has been very
    consistent in terms of what fonts it allows to be embedded in exported PDF files
    since InDesign 1.0!\r\n \r\n(2)     There is a signficant difference between having
    a \"licensed font\" and a font for which the license permits embedding of the
    font within an output file such as PDF. Furthermore, there are differences between
    what the physical font file indicates are embedding restrictions and what may
    actually be provided in writing in the font's EULA (End User License Agreement).
    Thus, you may be \"licensed\" for a font, but that doesn't necessarily mean that
    your license permits embedding of such a font in another file. Note that these
    are not as you put it Adobe licensing agreements (see 4 below).\r\n \r\n(3)     For
    TrueType and OpenType fonts, there are embedding privilege flags inside the font.
    These range from the most liberal embedding (allowing installation of such embedded
    fonts on a \"receiving\" system) to moderate restriction (editable - allows you
    to edit documents that have the embedded font) to further restrictive (preview
    and print - allows you only to display and print documents using the embedded
    font) to full restriction (no embedding of the font permitted). Adobe applications
    do honor those embedding privilege flags. Note that Type 1 fonts (in ancient times
    referred to as \"PostScript fonts\") do not have such embedding privilege flags
    and as such, we have no way of knowing the intent of the font supplier. Thus,
    such fonts are not restricted by Adobe applications in terms of embedding.\r\n
    \r\n(4)     Just so that you understand the context of why Adobe abides by the
    embedding restriction flags inside of TrueType and OpenType fonts, please understand
    that this wasn't Adobe's effort at protecting Adobe's or anyone else's turf. All
    fonts that you may license from Adobe have at least \"preview and print\" embedding
    privileges; those fonts from Adobe that are of our own design provide the more
    liberal \"editable embedding\" privileges. Adobe has been very consistent in urging
    other font foundries not to put unreasonable barriers to font embedding in PDF
    files, but we cannot control the business practices of these other foundries.
    In fact, it was in response to lawsuits against Adobe by some of these other font
    foundries that we started enforcing embedding restrictions!\r\n \r\n(5)     If
    all this isn't bad enough, even if a font does physically permit embedding, what
    really governs a font's legal status is the EULA. An OpenType or TrueType font
    may not physically indicate that a font may not be embedded, but if the EULA prohibits
    embedding, as the licensee you are legally bound to not embed such fonts in a
    PDF or any other type of file. Furthermore, some EULAs allow embedding, but the
    license provides that you must pay a royalty fee to the font foundry for each
    copy of the resultant PDF file that you distribute. Read your EULAs very carefully.\r\n
    \r\n(6)     As I and others indicated earlier in this thread, there are indeed
    fonts distributed with operating systems and other applications that do have licensing
    restrictions. Sorry, but Adobe can't do anything about that!\r\n \r\n          -

  body: Agreed.  Ideally all fonts provided with the OS should be embeddable, as users
    are not much interested in checking this out whenever they use one.  I think that
    has probably always been Apple's intention, but they have missed some.  They could
    either upgrade their license or leave the restricted fonts out or put them in
    an optional install with a warning.
