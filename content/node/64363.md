  the last line of the baseline does not sit on the bottom margin guide. Does anyone
  knows how to adjust this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nRC"

  body: You need to calculate it, setting the starting point and the increments. And
    the margins, too.

  body: "Just for example, I start the baseline at 0pt from the top margin, with a
    8pt/10pt type leading and 15mm margins. The last line of the baseline will only
    sit on the bottom margin if I adjust the bottom margin, but let\xB4s say that
    I don\xB4t want to change my margins values. Can you give me an example of a baseline
    grid with these measurements?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nRC"

  body: "I usually use millimeters to measure baselines.\r\nYou should adjust the
    starting point of the baseline in order to align it to the bottom margin. The
    exact measurements will depend on the paper height too."

  body: Correct me if I am wrong, but if the bottom grid on a design falls on the
    bottom margin, then text cannot sit on that line, because there will be no room
    for the descenders (or do I misread what you are asking).

  body: There's debate over wheter the alignment should be with ascenders/descenders
    or with x-height/baseline. In any case, InDesign let the descenders go under the
    bottom margin.
