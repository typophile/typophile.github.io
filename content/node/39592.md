  me what I was looking for, so if I just need to be redirected, go for it. :-)\r\n\r\nThe
  situation is this- I have a book I need to format for someone (my dad actually)
  and am already stuck- trying to decide what font to use! \r\n\r\nThe only info I'm
  beginning with is that I'd like to use serif, having heard more than once that sans
  serif is inadvisable for books.\r\n\r\nI would like to give a better idea of what
  I'm looking for, but my ignorance has got the best of me here. The book is non-fiction,
  essentially about ethics, society, agnosticism, serious schtuff like that. :-)\r\n\r\nSo
  if anyone has suggestions of fonts I can try, I'm all ears. I'm also open to suggestions
  regarding books about fonts for books, but that is more long term, as I need to
  begin formatting this book yesterday.\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice you can give,\r\nGertie"

    25 years. I guess that makes me an old fogy.\r\n\r\nHow to be with it (if that's
    still an acceptable hip term) is to go to a catalog of a juried book show, and
    see what fonts the designers who got the most books in the show used.\r\n\r\nThen
    increase the leading. If they set 10/15, you set 10/18.\r\n\r\nIgnore what the
    book is about. Ignore the audience (who's going to read it). After all, the biggest
    design problem is designer boredom. Solve that, and everything else falls into
    place.\r\n\r\nAnd since I seem to be filled with vitrol this morning, to Will
    Powers: Why in the world would you use boldface for subheads? I can see it in
    a travel book, where the reader is skipping around, trying to find only what interests
    him/her. But in a book to be read continuously, a subhead simply takes the place
    of a paragraph used to transit from one topic to another. You don't need to ruin
    the color of the page by using boldface.\r\n\r\nBut back to the original question:
    what's the book about? Who (aside from your dad) is going to read it? "

  body: "I was going to stay out of this, but now I can't help myself.\r\n\r\nI have
    to say that Cheltenham is one of the most unlikely and idiosyncratic choices I
    can think of for setting book text.\r\n\r\nBut that's speaking in generalities.
    I suppose I would have to consider which specific Cheltenham we're talking about
    (please tell me *not* ITC Cheltenham) and what the nature of the book is -- format,
    topic, audience. Even so, I have a hard time swallowing it.\r\n\r\nI, too, applaud
    Carl's list and his perspective -- even though I will confess that there are a
    handful of faces on his list that I would not likely employ for book work. But
    maybe that's just the books I work on.\r\n\r\nI do use Miller regularly; it's
    a standard for me. I've used Mercury with modest success (but I think that's just
    me getting used to it -- the face has the right qualities and attributes to recommend
    it, especially with the grades to play with). And of course, Whitman now and then
    (what can I say? ;-). \r\n\r\nI've worked with Chaparral and it can serve in certain
    contexts. (The page design wasn't mine, and I was skeptical at first, but came
    to terms with it.) I've seen Will use it to good effect.\r\n\r\nI've admired Merlo
    and Rongel, but haven't had a chance to get close enough to them to be certain.
    Kingfisher, too, holds great promise and has been recommended by designers whose
    judgment I value. Arnhem has been highly recommended, and I've been keeping my
    eye on it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have mixed feelings about Scala. I admired the design
    when it was released, but I just don't care for it in books. It's certainly been
    done often enough (I noticed there was a raft of Scala in last year's AAUP award
    winners), but it's too stiff and clunky for me in book text. (This was, in fact,
    part of the impetus to develop Whitman.)\r\n\r\nAnd much as I admire Farnham and
    Prensa as designs and for periodicals, I find they are too distracting in book
    text for my taste. I'm afraid the same might hold true for Feijoa (again, much
    as I admire it); but I'm willing to suspend final judgment until I've had occasion
    to put it through more paces.\r\n\r\nAll that said, Carl's is a pretty solid list.
    Even those I have dismissed, I might reconsider under the right circumstances,
    with the right manuscript.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI haven't used Cheltenham for running text in about 20 years. I'm a bit
    of an old fogy too but it reminds me of the 80s, as does Goudy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I haven't bought a new serif font in awhile because if I'm going to buy a font
    for text use I want the complete family and I just haven't had the money recently.
    I have my eye on Atma and Miller. \r\n\r\nBut I think for a book where the text
    is the thing, not the design, Janet would be wise to stick with a font that doesn't
    have too much personality, which is why some of Carl's fonts might not work for
    her. Chaparral for example, I keep trying to use it and it always seems to fall
    short. I can't articulate why."

    at the risk of seeming to nag, while you may feel confident estimating the performance
    of book types by viewing them onscreen, I think it's unrealistic to think that
    is enough information. I would have had a more harsh reaction to the idea of Cheltenham
    for books, except I took a look at the ITC Cheltenham specimen, and while I understand
    Kent's and others' revulsion, I can see how the Book weight could be used at small
    sizes. I think this is due to its large x-height, and would be possible only with
    generous tracking. It wasn't really possible for me to make an estimation of its
    capabilities without that real example. I encourage you to make more of an effort
    to research these new faces; If you get PDF specimens and print them out at 1200
    dpi, you might be surprised to discover that some of them are indeed valuable,
    appealing workhorses. "

  body: "\"While some may argue for personal preference, I agree with Colin Wheildon
    that setting a book in Sans Serif is not a good idea. Good for a STOP sign but
    not for a book.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with this and other iterations of
    the sentiment is that it pre-emptively collapses every example of \"sans\" into
    a single abstract idea, somehow made binarily opposed to the similarly generic
    and abstract idea of \"serif\". It's the most oversimplified, thoughtless, outdated
    trope that unfortunately still has currency with otherwise intelligent designers.
    Consider:\r\n\r\nIs digital Bauer Bodoni, at 9 points, set solid, printed in a
    weak gray ink on hard glossy paper, necessarily, categorically easier to read,
    safer, more advisable than Syntax, at 11/14, in a rich black ink on soft off-white
    paper? This is one possible interpretation of the \"axiom\" being repeated above.
    It isn't enough to simply say that this exception proves the rule, since every
    real-world example you can think of is an exception. \r\n\r\nThere are so many
    different typefaces under the heading of \"Sans\" and so many \"Serif\" that the
    very idea that \"serif is better than sans for books\" now sounds like something
    you say when you have no other information, or have no ability to discern the
    differences between typefaces. It's not a visual idea at all. It made a lot more
    sense in the early 20th century when the available range of types was so much
    more limited, but this is a very different world typographically, and readers
    have evolved as well. What constitutes a \"Sans\" typeface has expanded and grown
    considerably more complex since this kind of distinction was first made. The evolution
    of the Sans letter has been a very recent and very sudden one. \r\n\r\nIt may
    cause a number of readers here to become defensive and reach for their Updike
    and Morison for reinforcement, but I challenge you all to perform with your own
    eyes, the actual, literal act of reading text set in some of the newer sans designs
    (see Florian's list above) and compare them with our \"classics\" like Bodoni,
    Garamond 3, Cheltenham, Bookman, Palatino, Trump Mediaeval, or any other faces
    considered acceptable or safe for book text. \r\n\r\nMy contention is that this
    sentiment, this axiom, this truism of typography is an unexamined myth, waiting
    to be disproved by the simple act of direct engagement with the real typographic
    scene of today. It is an echo of earlier times, before the sans letter had undergone
    the enormous, rich and rapid evolution it has undergone during the last century.
    Right now, it's 2008, and Florian's list is a very useful bellwether of the changes
    the genre of \"Sans\" has undergone since Updike and Morison were even alive.
    \r\n\r\nI've done my part by designing a typeface for book text that has no serifs.
    Others have existed, and more are on the way. If you want a printed specimen of
    Beorcana, which is a real example of its actual performance, contact me. As always,
    judging typefaces online for book text is useless. \r\n\r\nRepeating a tired axiom
    from decades past only limits you, leaving you prejudiced, blind and unable to
    take advantage of recent advances. Join the 21st century. "

  body: "You know, a study on why sans have been cast as inferior in legibility would
    be very informative in the construction and usage of fonts in general.\r\nI can
    see several differences that could be looked at: the serifs themselves, line width
    variation (humanist sans seem to be a recent development), weight (sans are often
    heavier), spacing, and letter shape.\r\n\r\nA good idea would be to take a wide
    variety of serif fonts, and slice off the serifs and line endings, which would
    be saved separately as serif sets. Then, a variety of sans serif fonts and the
    castrated fonts from earlier would be taken, to each of which each serif set would
    be applied, as well as Optima, Albertus, and Candara-style flarings and finishing
    off the castrated serifs as sans (given that different sans use different cuts
    [this being one of the main differences between Helvetica and Arial], various
    endings from sans could also be added to the mix-and-match). This would, of course,
    require great skill, as tailoring would be necessary for each combination, and
    potentially tens of thousands of man-hours.\r\nAfter this, the various combinations
    could be tested for legibility. Due to the large number of combinations, this
    test would be much simpler than it would be for single fonts (though finding enough
    people would be tough). The scores could than be tied to each feature, so there
    would be an average of all scores of combinations with geometric builds and an
    average for old style serifs."

    looks vulgar in a book.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, my vote is for fat (Adobe Caslon or
    MT Plantin with OSF) over slightly condensed letter forms, like Minion. I disagree
    with one poster's aversion to Scala in books: I feel it looks great. Josh Darden's
    re-think of Fournier, Corundum, is just outstanding. Then there are all the options
    re periods and themes: mid-19th-century is effectively called up by ITC Bodoni
    12, and earlier 1800s by either Storm's version of Walbaum or Richard Beatty's
    of Kennerley. For evocations of late 18th century French typography, we're still
    needy: Sirenne and Acanthus are just too heavy to work properly in today's book
    designs.\r\n\r\nWe still have a horrible problem with foundries releasing text
    families that lack bold and/or bold italic. There are lots of manuscripts that

  body: "This is a pretty old thread. I imagine a number of us are finished with it
    -- I can't even say why I looked at this last post. With that in mind, you might
    do better starting a new one.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I don't think of
    Minion as <cite>wrong</cite> for science, but I don't think it is the best choice,
    either. I think Minion's Greek characters are drawn primarily for classical Greek
    -- note the Greek extended (aka polytonic) glyphs, used only with ancient Greek.
    You would know better than I whether or not Minion's Greek glyphs are appropriate
    for science. I remember having to change something -- either the theta or phi?
    -- for some technical figures supplied to us by a designer using Minion -- they
    used the wrong ones. The scientific ones are there, but not in the \"regular\"
    Unicode spot.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the font has none of the chemical bonding characters,
    and I believe it doesn't have alphabetic superiors/inferiors. The superior/inferior
    numbers aren't quite right for science either -- nor are they quite right for
    footnote calls.\r\n\r\nI imagine there are better fonts for your purpose, even
    though Minion is quite a nice font."

  body: "I'm not the best person to ask about scientific superscripts, but I do remember
    Arno well because it was just a couple weeks ago I went in and made the superscripts
    both smaller, and raised them up. Also put the superscripted numbers on a proportional
    body & kerned them. Also made sure the superscript alphas and numbers had a common
    \"baseline.\"\r\n\r\nActually, these were the \"number.super\" glyphs, switched
    by the superiors feature. Scientific notation should be called by the Unicode
    index for superiors (except as I remember, superscript alphas aren't encoded?
    See, I told you I wasn't the best person to ask). Adobe's superiors feature doesn't
    switch to these, and that gives improper syntax. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, scientific
    superiors should have a certain relationship with both cap & l.c. letters, and
    lining numbers. All of these should fit well with the tops of parens & brackets,
    too, which isn't the case with Arno. Arno is a lovely font, but again, IMO, not
    for scientific work.\r\n\r\nAdam doesn't post much on the design forum, but I'd
    trust his judgment, or any of the programmer types with an engineering background

    I probably fall into the 3 strikes catagory when it comes to scientific work.
    I did work for an engineering firm in 1969 and did several books for them. Those
    were the old days and we used phototype so I specd the type but did not set it.
    There were plenty of math formulas which I pasted up but left the proof reading

  body: "<cite>You think Venetian fonts aren\u2019t suitable for chemistry design-wise.
    What kind would you suggest?</cite>\r\n\r\nAh. Not sure. The last time I had to
    deal with equations as an \"author\" was when I took (& passed!) my math-logic
    prelim in 1970. As a compositor, I've set a bunch of equations since then, usually
    in economics.\r\n\r\nBook interior design is all about audience, and a little
    bit about the author. If I'm faced with designing a book where I don't know the
    subject matter, I look to see what typefaces other designers have used, over a
    period of time. That \"period of time\" is the best way to avoid getting caught
    using a current fashion that will soon fade.\r\n\r\nAs a WAG, I doubt most chemists
    would find, say,  Bembo a comfortable font for professional work. Something modern,
    but plain. In my grad student days that was Times Roman, but Times has become
    so much a design taboo that has probably changed.\r\n\r\nI still remember one
    of my professors saying \"Prelims are puberty rites,\" and my dissertation director
    saying \"just get it done.\" Since he had taken ten years to write his on the
    early psychology of Agostino  Nifo, I figured he was wrong. But it turned out
    he was right, & I never finished mine.\r\n\r\nMoral: Steal a design from something
    the audience will be comfortable with, & get on with your life.  "

    my <a href=\"http://www.costumegoddess.com/series.htm\"><strong>costume how-to

    <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1MX\"><strong>Book Antigua</strong></a>
    for body text, and I still use that for the book series, with Zapf Humanist for
    subtitles. \r\n\r\nI know it's the custom here to disapprove of Windows-installed
    fonts, but what do you think of that choice? To me it has always looked pleasantly
