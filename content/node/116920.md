  body: "Victor, I know the feeling! \r\nYou produced the same answer independently,
    which confirms your font detective skills.  \r\nThe US Social Security card has
    had various forms of lettering for the wordmark since the 1930s. The designer
    of this incarnation might have thought that this would look unique and nobody
    would connect it with Bernhard Bold Condensed. BTW, I don't know whether Lucien
    Bernhard was involved in making Bernhard Bold Condensed by Monotype Design Studio,
    aka Bernhard Antiqua Schmalfette, when published by Bauer Type Foundry. \r\nDon"
