body: "Hi,\r\nI'm struggling with pdf export to print. I have a document, where the
  cover page has a red background with a black graphic and a black title on it. The
  graphic is imported from Illustrator (.ai) and created originally in the same cmyk
  profile as the ID document. It, like the text is 0c0m0y100k, but in ID overprint
  view as well as in final pdf file (Acrobat's overprint) it shows the graphic as
  gray but the title as dark black.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened there? I know that cmyk
  100k black shows gray on screen, but I'm worried that these two black objects on
  the cover print differently, one gray, the other black.. I've checked that their
  (ID and Illustrator) color profiles are the same and without overprint preview in
  Acrobat both objects look gray. Only in overprint does the title turn out black.
  I also tried to import the graphic as Illustrator tif-file, but that looks gray,
  too.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated,\r\n\r\n--patrik\r\n\r\nedit: added an image (screen
  shot) showing the problem when viewed in Acrobat..\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_blacks_6212.jpg]"

    whether everything is as planned by printing separations from your PDF to another
    PDF by printing from Acrobat to the Adobe PDF printer: Print->Advanced->Color:
    Separations and then select what you want in the ink manager. Probably the preview
    will already show you if everything is as you wanted it.'

  body: "Hi, it looks like you have the overprint switched on for your type, select
    the type and turn the overprint off, if not that then check your black it could
    be the registration black (though with the red showing through the black it looks
    like you have overprint switch on for that type)\r\n\r\nAlso in preferences for
    Indesign, 'appearance of black' switch off 'overprinting black' and the options
    for RGB and grayscale 'printing/exporting' switch to 'output all blacks as rich
    black', (having it as 'output all blacks as accurately' can result with black
    not being 100% K when exporting a grayscale. \r\n\r\nWith Indesign you can view
    with overprint on, then you will see where you are going wrong and what has an
    overprint or..... is registration black or special black."

  body: "Hi,\r\nconcrete: The type wasn't overprint, but the setting for overprinting
    black was checked and unchecking it solved the problem! The 'output all blacks
    as rich black', however, was selected. Thanks for the advice! \r\n\r\nLars: I
    tried printing separations to Adobe PDF and the preview shows both the graphic
    and  type printing only on black plate, the same way in both the previous and
    this new pdf I exported.. So did the setting mentioned above make any real change?
    What actually happened with unchecking the box? Is it recommended to keep it unchecked
    when exporting pdfs? It says that it should be checked when printing separations...
    I'm still quite new to (and a bit confused with :)) all the color management stuff,
    so any clarification to these points is greatly appreciated. Again. :)\r\n\r\nthanks
    for your help!\r\n--patrik"

  body: "Overprinting black is used to prevent gaps by just printing black over all
    the other inks. When you look at the separation plates you can create for both
    versions, you should notice that the red background isn't knocked out by the black
    objects when overprint black is turned on. When it is turned off, there would
    be white areas where the black will go.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: You should verify
    with your print-shop and others here will also know a lot more about this than
    myself... My general understanding however is that you would usually  want to
    overprint black so you don't get gaps from misalaignment where the different colors
    meet. You could also use trapping to compensate that but as the black ink would
    be opaque anyway, overprinting would render more consistent results - given that
    it is suitable for your particular printing scenario."

  body: "your welcome...\r\nAlso, remember inks and especially black are translucent,
    so if you overprint a colour the based colour will show through when overprinting,
    \ if the job was half green and half red the black if overprinted (and being a
    large graphic) would look different.\r\n\r\nwhen to use overprinting when the
    point size is 5point or less?.. or if 9 point or less on newspaper print.\r\n\r\nit's
    all trial and error."

  body: "Thanks for the explanation! I guess I'd better just start practicing and
    experimenting with different options to get the hang of it. :) But first I'll
    turn my previous question around: when is it (if ever) recommended to not use
    overprint black in print jobs? If there is the risk of misalignment and unwanted
    white gaps..\r\n\r\n--patrik"

  body: do not use when the type is large, or the graphic if it is going over different
    coloured backgrounds, unless that is the effect you are going for. If in doubt
    read the Indesign help tips
