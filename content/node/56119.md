  if I got [[http://www.linotype.com/13501/bellgothicbold-font.html?PHPSESSID=206854cce463abebc6694f5d56787cc1#technical|Bell
  Gothic STD]] and wanted to use [[http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/|roundingUFO]]
  to change it, could I then use the resulting font commercially? could I sell it? '

    read the EULA <strong>before</strong> you buy it."

    and use Word to find/replace Holden Caulfield's name to Colton Hallfield, then
    you could publish that as \"Catcher in the Wry\".\r\n\r\nThe answer to your question
    is no. You don't own the intellectual property of Bell Gothic, so you don't own
    the results of screwing around with the outlines. The EULA may allow you to do
    said screwing around, but that doesn't make the underlying design or software
    code your property.\r\n\r\nIf I came to your house and painted it a different
    color, could I then put it up for sale?"

  body: "great idea about 'Catcher in the Rye' that's gonna get me through the recession!\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying that I was going to try to sell a round bell gothic or anything. I
    just want to know if I can change the outlines for the purposes of a project..
    for example, I might do a branding project where the text would have a black line
    right through the center.. would it be all that different if I were to make it
    rounded?\r\n\r\nI read the EULA on linotype and of course I couldn't redistribute
    it, but I didn't see anything saying that I can't modify it..\r\n\r\n- Scott"

  body: There is actually some variance in whether foundries allow making derivative
    fonts for internal use, which is why I recommend to read the EULA. My EULA allows
    it. I doubt any would allow modification and resale!

    or anything.</i>\r\n\r\nYes. Yes you did:\r\n<i>...if I got Bell Gothic STD and
    wanted to use roundingUFO to change it, could I then use the resulting font commercially?
    could I sell it?</i>\r\n\r\nAre you a Republican or something? Do you even pay
    attention to what you're writing or saying?\r\n\r\nAs Mr Shin suggests, you should
    read the EULA. Some of them allow you to screw with fonts for the purposes of
    making your work and others do not. Selling, on the other hand, is almost certainly
    completely fobidden by everyone.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, if you screw around with Bell
    Gothic, someone here is going to tell Matthew Carter, and he will come to your
    house - after I have painted it and put it up for sale - and he will kick your
    Republican ass."

    and using an altered typeface for my projects, I just threw the other one in as
    an afterthought. BOTH questions are absolutely rhetorical. the question was politely
    answered by Mr. Shinn.. and I get accused of being a Republican by of all people
    a fellow Ohioan! I really don't understand why you're getting so upset about these
    things. I have plenty of respect for type designers, EULAs, ethics.. etc. \r\n\r\n-

    for derivates. Or in other words, you can manipulate, but not re-sell.
