<div class=commentbody>I'm sure this has been discussed many time before. Perhaps we need an FAQ, or a database in which people can go and see which letters which designers start with. <br> <br>For the record, in a Latin typeface I usually start with <i>i</i>(<i>l</i>)<i>n</i>(<i>mh</i>)<i>p</i>(<i>bdq</i>)<i>aeg</i>. The letters in parentheses are usually roughed in as soon as I have enough related forms. My first test word is usually <i>nihilim</i>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>On the MATD at Reading I ask people to start with <br>a d h e s i o n <br>(the o is an o-acute). <br>This word provides a good introduction to elements that can be initially transferred but also need fiddling with (n-h-i); an equally good introduction to more individual letters (a) includes middle bars (the a and e) which are strong determinants of typographic colour; makes people think about diacritics from the start; and, courtesy of the s, can give rise to lots of discussions on bezier techniques. Avoiding the g is in my view important, as it is quite difficult for beginners, and with a wider acceptable design space within each style. <br>The letters in "adhesion" also allow decent texts to be composed, so that people can begin proofing the texture of the typeface pretty early in the process.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As reckless and naive as it is, I start with "a" - I'm not a real text face designer yet - plus I don't make numerically enough [Latin] fonts to have a solid method. After "a" I rough out certain letters that would be best at expressing the spirit fleshed out in the "a", and I guess this depends how much character the face is to have*. If it's supposed to be docile, I'll probably make the "n" and the other structural primitives; if it's flamboyant, I might do roughs of the "g" or the "f" or the "y" very early. The "o" I do very late, for some reason. After the roughs, I tend to go straight in and design the lc alphabet sequentially, always leaving things open for major revision. Maybe this way is slower but leaves things more open? <br> <br>* Which makes me point out: I think we need to distinguish between text and display font design. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I mean when we state what letter(s) we start with. <br>For example, I think starting with the "n" is less helpful in display design than it is in text design.

<div class=commentbody>As I see it: <br> <br>Type design is like chemistry, biology, math and physics. <br> <br>It is a chain reaction. It is an answer to the questions: What is space? How do you want to create this space? <br> <br>The method is a subjective issue, of course. <br> <br>I start with group relationships. I draw H O h o to establish capital and lowercase proportions. <br> <br>When I have the h I have the x (height). Then I have the e & a. Then I have the p or q........ <br> <br>Then I take a break. And try to build a word.... <br> <br> <br>That is, more or less, my method. A chain reaction. And subjective. As I said. <br> <br> <br> <br>David Hamuel </div>

<div class=commentbody>I have tried to find a logic in the order of letters Matthew chose: <br> <br>The design of the h in first place allows to set the proportions of the x height and the ascender/upper case, but also the basics of the modulation that will dtermine the shape. <br> <br>The o is the full expresion of the chosen modulation, p and d show the way the modulation will connect bowls with stems and set the descender line. <br> <br>Finally "a" is a letter on which experiment complex modulation and stilitic approaches. <br> <br>This lacks the diagonal letters: KVWXYZ</div>

<div class=commentbody>To me so-called "true" italics are nothing but fake (at least in a general text face), and a good italic is a modified slanted roman (although not the naive stuff Morison advocated), so it doesn't have its own fundamentally different "development". BTW, did you guys know that Morison took false credit for that idea? American foundries were doing slanted romans (although of the same naive kind) way before him. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> Could you show me an example of a "good" italic and a "bad" that you have in mind? <br> <br>My pleasure! :-) <br> <br>It's much easier to point out "bad" ones (although I want to clarify that I find them only ideologically bad - usually they're generally "usable" italics, whatever that means) because there's so many of them. Basically the italics that are fed an extra IV-shot of chirography (hand-based design) as a means of either pulling them away from the roman, or (worse) expressing some misplaced artistic preference, are "bad". Usually this means the italic is drawn from scratch, and this generally detracts from its function as a style subordinate to the [hopefully more typographic] roman. Of course, an italic also does indeed need to stand out sufficiently from a body of roman, but there's plenty of leeway to do that without resorting to Stone Age nostalgia. BTW, an alternative, secondary italic that's highly chirographic is functionally fine (although ideologicaly still a no-no). Heck, you can even make one of those now-fashionable "upright italics", but: don't pretend it works the way users need an italic to work; I think it would be better to call that a "cursive roman". <br> <br>As for "good" ones, they're very rare. I notice one once in a blue moon, but an italic that I've admired for a while is Octavian's*. Although it's still a bit too chirographic for my tastes, at least it matches its roman in that, so it doesn't use chirography as a drag queen outfit. Also, although I don't pretend it's the best thing since sliced bread, but I have tried to express my ideal-italic theories in my own work, specifically Patria**. It still needs some effort before it's ready (like optical slant correction, and length adjustment in some serifs and beaks) but I'm proud of the fact that the outlines are in fact mathematically derived from the same source as the roman (with some subsequent adjustment) but people still think it's usable (unlike the Morison stuff). <br> <br>* <a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml target=_blank>http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml</a> <br> <br>** <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>The o is the full expresion of the chosen modulation...</i> <br> <br>Except the o is often an exception to the modulation, i.e. the stress is often rotated (usually clockwise) in the o, even if only subtly.

<div class=commentbody>I think you should made a disctinction between counter forms and position of the thickest/bolder part on the letters. <br> <br>A counter form don't always follow the form, or try to be more clear the thickest/bolder part on the letter. <br> <br>So, its quite obvious that in an oblique axis typeface, the bdpq can't fit well with the o for the position of the boldest part of the letter but generally fit the o for the axis of the counter form. <br> <br>Its depending what you looking first, black or white part of the letters.

<div class=commentbody>I am amazed at Hrant's statement about good and bad italics. <br> <br>Is not a slanted roman really an oblique? And I thought a true italic was really a seperate design that in modern type compliments a roman in weight and color ...etc. <br> <br>I think of a slanted roman as a 'bad' italic, as it adds nothing to the family/face and is more a product of digital bastardization than actual design. <br> <br>As too renaming italics as cursive romans - well, that kinda ignores historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing, no? So, why not leave that alone? Why rename something that is aptly named and is correct in its lable? <br> <br>One could argue that romans should have no italic, as italics historicaly stood on their own. But to say that only slanted romans are useful and good seems a bit of a stretch to this amatuer type guy. <br> <br>Hrant, maybe I am misunderstanding your comments. Would you care to elaborate? <br> <br>Tanks! <br> <br>BTW, I am a terriable speller - do we have a spell check on the forum??? If not, thank you for your patience with my lack. <br> <br>;)</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I think you should made a disctinction between counter forms and position of the thickest/bolder part on the letters.</i> <br> <br>Yes, this is a very good point, and it is interesting to look over the illustration above while concentrating on the counter axis. There is less variation in the counter axis of the o and other letters than is apparent when one looks at the modulation of the whole letter. There are also, though, some surprises: the axis of the counter of the Calisto o is actually rotated slightly <i>anti</i>clockwise compared to the d. Never noticed that before.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mike, I agree that mechanically slanted romans suck. Morison's mistake was that he failed to temper his ideology with design sense (probably because he had none of the latter). What I'm advocating is non-chirographic italics, which isn't the same thing at all. It is counter to the essence of typography to use chirography to differentiate two styles, just like romans themselves can be more or less chirographic (and I think the latter are weaker). <br> <br>Such an italic can even be drawn seperately than the roman, as long as it harmonizes <i>in its subordinate role</i>. The primary contemporary function of an italic is to emphasize words in a body of roman - that's how users use the stuff. And all an italic really needs to perform this primary funciton is slant (although lighter color and other divergences can help too, especially if the slant is slight). Any other use of an italic (such as for an independent body of text) is strictly secondary. That at least isn't dogma, it's pragmatism. <br> <br>BTW, I think multiple italics are a great idea. <br> <br>> it adds nothing <br> <br>You could say it's not supposed to add anything, it's just supposed to not detract from functionality. An italic that's more chirographic than its roman diluted the focus of the overall design. <br> <br>> cursive romans <br> <br>I meant that only in reference to what's called "upright italics", like in Seria and Unibody. I have no problem calling slanted italics "italics" (as long as they're not merely obliques), not least because a new term would confuse things! But I think "cursive roman" is a better description for upright italics, simply because slant is the primary determinant for the <i>user</i>, who as a layman has no idea about chirographic versus typographic structures (certainly not consciously). <br> <br>> historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing <br> <br>1) What's more important, the past or the future? <br>2) Hey, romans came from there too! But now they've broken free (although still not enough, yet) - so let's do the same favor for italics. <br> <br>> to say that only slanted romans are useful and good <br> <br>I was careful to say that chirographic italics can be -and are- "useful" to many -probably most- people. <br>But there's a difference between what the masses casually choose versus how culture progresses. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant - thank you for making a distinction and clarifying your argument. I wondered if I had not quite understood the essence of what you were saying. <br> <br>I would also agree that usage should be a primary conscern when designing, so an italic should be valued for its ability to do its job. <br> <br>But, having said that, I would argue that something that has proven successful for hundreds of years is rooted in useability. Maybe not always, but a high percentage of successful design is based on historical evolutions. <br> <br>Thanks for taking the time to explain.</div>
