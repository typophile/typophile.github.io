  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In my typography class we were all given 3 typefaces from different time periods to research and create typographic specimens for. There will be 3 spreads; one for each typeface. We are supposed to connect our 3 typefaces through a theme to unify the spreads. I am having a tough time coming up with a concept to link them all together. We should have around 500 words in our copy for each spread. My typefaces are:</p>
<p>Fette Fraktur
DIN Neuzeit
Interstate</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas? I was thinking I could make some sort of &ldquo;labels&rdquo; for products of the time period they are from. Another idea was to relate the architecture styles of the time periods they were created in.</p>
<p>Fill me in with your thoughts or ideas! I could sure use some help with this one&hellip; 
*I forgot to mention that I do not need to use the things these three have in common, I can also play off of the contrast these 3 have between eachother.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The obvious thing would be to use a transportation theme, since DIN and Interstate are highway fonts; for the fraktur you could have a fictional scenario where Germany never started WWII and now uses fraktur for road signage - since the Nazis actually ended up banning blackletter eventually, and it can be argued that the German reliance on blackletter might have continued otherwise.</p>
<p>A more creative idea might be to have some kind of confrontation between the three: the fraktur could complain that the other two are frigid; the DIN might bitch about Interstate being a fat burger-gobbler, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As far as the transportation or roadsign theme, there are ways that it might work pretty well&hellip; Correct me if I am wrong, but one of the main reasons that DIN came to be, was to be used as for Germany alone? Is that still its purpose in Germany today? That makes a pretty good scenario for how I can relate Fraktur and DIN&hellip; But then what about Interstate?</div>

&ldquo;supposed to connect our 3 typefaces through a theme to unify the spreads&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m misreading the word &ldquo;specimens&rdquo; and what you mean is &ldquo;examples of good use&rdquo;, but, Normally, when making a series of &ldquo;typographic specimens&rdquo;, the typographer shows the fonts in a variety of sizes within the family, a mix of styles, an &ldquo;all-characters&rdquo; composition, and if space-paper permits, an example of use, like a box of Tide, a business card or, etc&hellip;and if even more space permits in good contrast with other families of type.</p>
<p>In most traditional specimens, the connecting theme is the layout itself, which is commonly simple, allowing each typeface family freedom to be composed as the &ldquo;voice of the face requests&rdquo;, avoiding the need to make up &ldquo;a history&rdquo; of Germany in order to get 3 pretty different fonts into the same connecting &ldquo;use&rdquo; ;)</p>
