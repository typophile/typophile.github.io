  body: Sorry Jared, can&#39;t nail this one. <BR> <BR>Doesn&#39;t seem to be Alias
    or Acme or Darren Scott <BR>from the pdfs that I have. <BR> <BR>Could be Identikal.
    Anyone?

    alt="smiley.jpg"> <BR> <BR> <BR>I check out that magazine regularly and always
    <BR>thought the type was from Alias. <BR> <BR>I wonder why he doesn&#39;t have
    that on his site? <BR> <BR>bj

  body: bj probably it was in the agreement when he sold them the typeface, that it
    was theirs and theirs only.

  body: Thanks...hmmm. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe that ESPN would prohibit him from
    <BR>putting the typeface in his online portfolio or publicizing it. <BR>If that
    were the case, <BR>then we wouldn&#39;t have seen &#42;any&#42; mention of it
    anywhere. <BR> <BR>But who knows and who cares, right? <BR> <BR>uh, well I guess
    we typophiles care. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>actually, my guess is that Hubert hasn&#39;t
    updated <BR>his site in a while. <BR> <BR>Thie site says that Adonis &#40;Details
    typeface&#41; is exclusive until  <BR>June 2002. <BR> <BR>Stephen&#39;s link is
    from January 2002. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
