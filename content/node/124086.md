  for a suggestion of a font that is similar to the example you see below in that
  I am looking for a sans serif font with the playfullness and curved legs of certain
  letters. \r\n\r\nI like this font but I really hate the texture and am worried about
  the time it will take to customize. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate any suggestions.
  \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nSarah"
