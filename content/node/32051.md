  really need some help! \r\nI'm almost there. I got it all done. But I still can't
  make Flash and Word recognize my font (on a Mac, not sure about windows yet). As
  I pointed in my earlier topic, my problem with word was a very different one, at
  least it recognized the font (and that is solved, or was at least). Now it just
  won't happen. TextEdit and all CS2 show it just fine. Does anyone have any idea
  why this is happening and hopefully how to fix it? It's OTF PS from FL5 on a OS
  X 10.4.8. I even exported a swf file from illustrator and imported it on flash.
  My font was replaced by a system default one, and the menu showed \"( MyFont ) System
  Default\".\r\nThanks!"
