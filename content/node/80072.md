  from dafont but I don't see it there. The closest was Carnevalee Freakshow but that's
  a big stretch. I don't see anything similar on myfont.com. The logo was made around
  5 years ago. \r\nThanks!\r\nSarah"

    this. It is difficult to tell whether it is custom lettering or some form of type
    without a few more characters to compare. '

  body: I'm embarrassed to say that I made this and stored it on a hard drive that's
    packed in a far-away storage unit. I could have sworn I used a font, but no, now
    that I think about it, you're right, I did do it by hand. Totally forgot. Yikes.
