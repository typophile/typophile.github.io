  body: "Pretty sure this was designed for the magazine, but look at some of the Bodoni
    or Didot fonts, and imagine slanting the Roman, because the italic 's' usually
    has ball terminals. I thought obliquing RR <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bodoni-rr-campanile/\">Bodoni
    Campanile</a>, for example, might be close. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
