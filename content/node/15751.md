  and handwriting. their properties and what happens if i mix them.\r\n\r\nbut before
  i can plant my pedigree i have to do some research about the basics of pixelfonts.\r\n\r\n-
  who inveted the first one? (i guess there where some bevore the computer)\r\n- which
  development they made over the years? (the fonts)\r\n\r\nits pretty hard to find
  something in the internet. maybe some of you have some information.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\njens"

    computers that used visual displays and hence bitmap fonts. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.old-computers.com/museum/default.asp\r\n\r\nAnother
    interesting area would be the bitmap fonts used in early coin-op arcade machines
    (many used multiple colors - something you don't see very often these days) and
    the custom mostly monospaced bitmap fonts created for games on 8bit home computers.
    You'll find plenty of screen grabs from both technologies on the Web."

  body: When I was working as a broadcast TV art director in the early 1980s, the
    then-state-of-the-art Chyron IV character generator used bitmap fonts. In fact,
    I created my first electronic typefaces using that system, using video capture
    and a VERY limited bitmap editing system.

  body: "Probably the oldest thing similar to bitmap fonts would be letters woven
    into fabric, as in a tapestry, or in rows of beads. There were also lighted signs
    composed of rows and columns of light bulbs before computers. I have also seen
    different colored bricks used to spell out a company name on old chimneys and
    buildings.\r\n\r\nEven though we associate this kind of letterform with computers,
    it was not a recent idea. I'm not sure exactly when bitmap letterforms began to
    be used with computers; probably the early 1970s. It was more common for early
    CRT displays to use vector-based letterforms because it used less memory. These
    would be simple connect-the-dot designs, not like modern outline fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think it would be possible to say who \"invented\" pixel fonts. The idea
    was known for a very long time before computers existed and I'm sure was simply
    used because of its natural affinity with the kind of displays used with computers."
