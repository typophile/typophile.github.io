  body: "Well I like the basis of the layout, there are typos and it could be tightened
    up. For hierarchy I would look at the subject of the dates, rather than the date,
    as most important, with the headline \"Call for Admissions\" \"Important Dates\"
    somehow separated by colour or space. Followed, in importance, by the diploma
    subjects section. I like the space created for the bottom third. Look forward
    to your next iteration.\r\nTim"
