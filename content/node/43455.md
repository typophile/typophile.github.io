  body: Posting multiples times is kinda discombobulating for those of us who travel
    all forums. I've moved all to the Type ID are, where they belong, but left ghosts
    for others to follow. In the past it hasn't really helped others to post multiple
    times.

  body: It's probably a very "normal" font that some has chopped up. You could get
    the same effect by using a bold font like Franklin Gothic or TheSans and putting
    a mask over it in Illustrator.

  body: "I repeat, you won't find a font that looks exactly like your sample. Someone
    took a fairly regular sans serif bold font and then worked with it in Illustrator
    to give it this effect - the curved corners, the cross in the middle. No, you
    won't find anything close to this right out of the box. But I think if you took
    almost any plain sans - I don't know offhand which one might have that angled
    tail on the g - and worked with it in Illustrator you could get very close.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a logo that someone has created out of a font, not a font per se."

    saying is that the creator has strated off with a font then pasted inside these
    squares. It must of been a font to start of with and I cant match the shapes to\r\n

  body: This isn't Aachen. The counter shapes are all wrong. The terminals on the
    stems aren't angled like this either. And, the backside interior stroke has a
    flat join with the arm.

    individual characters masked with squares and the whole assemblage masked with
    a large rounded corner rectangle.

  body: I think the key characteristics to look at here are the counters of the a
    and the g, and the terminal of the g. I can't figure it out myself, but maybe
    one of the more experienced typophiles here can figure it out from that diagonal
    terminal on the g and the distinctive terminal shapes.

    in the g and realized that the entire height of the character is the same as that
    of the lowercase a. That can't be correct. The counters in the g must have originally
    been taller along with the whole character."
