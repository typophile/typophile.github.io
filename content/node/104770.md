  The font in question is that of the attached text 'Servvizio Tecnico Assistenza
  Clienti' from an Olivetti ad.\r\n\r\nMy initial reaction was Universe Condensed,
  but on closer inspection it's not quite right and the poster is from 1953 and so
  would be too early for Univers.\r\n\r\nCan anyone else help? Is their any chance
  this would be hand-lettered?\r\n"

  body: Compacta SB Bold is close for STAC but the stem on the T does not taper like
    the one on the poster - could be hand lettered since is early even for phototype.
