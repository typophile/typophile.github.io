body: What is y'all's opinion on precomposed small caps?  Is it necessary to fill
  out the code pages with the accents are should mark positioning be enough? That
  is, if a program is smart enough to use OpenType small caps, can we presume it's
  smart enough to decompose U+00e0 to U+0061 and U+0300, and then use the small cap
  version of those?
