body: "Really just a question about how this works. I'll pose some hypotheticals.
  And I don't know enough about how x-heights measurements are specified, so I'll
  do my best and just hope my hypotheticals make sense.\r\n\r\nSay Type Designer A
  makes a typeface (let's call it SmallXTransitional (SmallXT)) with an x-height that
  is .7 of the point size. Type Designer B makes a very similar one (LargeXTransitional
  (LargeXT)) with an x-height of .8 the point size. Assume that SmallXT and LargeXT
  are quite similar, except for the x-height.\r\n\r\nYears later, along comes a layout
  project (say, a 16-page booklet), and the client wants two different comps from
  two different typesetters. Typesetter X uses SmallXT at 16pt with a line-height
  of 20pt. Typesetter Y uses LargeXT at 14pt, again with a line-height of 20pt.\r\n\r\nWhat
  will be the difference between the two? Am I wrong to suspect that the difference
  will only show up in the capitals? Or perhaps the ascenders/descenders? Will these
  two hypothetical settings be quite similar in character (all other things being
  equal), as I suspect?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    likely be drawn to the same weight when at the same relative point size. Essentially
    you''re still enlarging one more then the other. '

  body: "Traditionally, an x-height measurement is most often specified as a percentage
    of the ascender height (less frequently as a percentage of the cap height). However
    this assumes certain value ranges for descender depth and talus, so it's not a
    robust measure.\r\n\r\nIn terms of a percentage of the Em, the typical x-height
    is way less than 70% - it's closer to 40%.\r\n\r\nIf your SmallXT and LargeXT
    only vary in x-height*, you have to realize that that affects the relative sizes
    of the ascenders versus descenders, a relationship that would get thrown off,
    possibly to the point of the descenders ending up longer than the ascenders (generally
    a design flaw, at least in a text face).\r\n\r\n* BTW: http://typophile.com/node/81755\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    in your typesetting scenario, besides Mark's observation that the 16 point text
    will look darker, you will also see a difference in terms of the dimensions besides
    the x-height. Now, with 4-6 points of leading descenders being too long for example
    is rather moot; but the texture will indeed have a different feel (especially
    at those large sizes) partly due to the caps as well.\r\n\r\n> Does a small x-height

    you are; it doesn't torture letterforms, it just scales the type and re-labels
    the different sizes. Above is Centaur, Georgia-ized. The x-heights match, but
    the cap height at \"72\" is obviously too big in the Centaur.\r\n\r\nI overlayed
    normal Centaur with the one Font Squirrel x-height-matched with Georgia, and had
    to zoom normal Centaur 129.5% to approximate what Font Squirrel did.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/centaur-zoomed-129_6038.5.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    my x-height-matched Centaur, when I set it at 10px in my CSS, will \"really\"
    be 13px on the screen.\r\n\r\nI suppose I'd better make a test HTML page to see
    whether the baselines got all screwed up too. \r\n\r\nAnd when I'm done with all
    that, I'll be discarding my resized Centaur, since I'm doing this for testing
    purposes only and don't have a license agreement to use it on the web. Just, y'know,
    so I'm clear about that too."

  body: "I didn't have to do my own sample. A pretty comprehensive one comes with
    the @font-face kit. In one block of text, they have the line-height at 1.1, and
    the descenders of one line overlap the ascenders of the next. The same is true
    at 1.25. \r\n\r\nThere are example text blocks elsewhere with line heights of
    1.4444 - 1.5. The space between lines actually looks quite nice and balanced,
    but in places where descenders and ascenders line up between lines they *just*
    miss each other by an almost-acceptable amount. (Functionally, this is equivalent
    to \"using less leading for typefaces with a small x-height.\")\r\n\r\nThey line
    up the baselines and the \"x-height line\" (if that's the term for it).\r\n\r\nOf
    course there are other rendering problems, because Centaur has all those little
    details and graceful curves. And at \"12 pt\", the /o/ is comically way too large.
    I only picked Centaur because I knew it had a tiny x-height and would make a good
    contrast to Georgia; it's clearly not made for low-res screens.\r\n\r\nSo, via
    a circuitous route, I learned what I wanted to."

    Line) was probably the most common. Art Line was another. \r\n\r\nStandardization
    was desirable because mixing types on a single line was driven by the physical
    relationships of top/bottom, and they would only line up if there was a common
    placement of the baseline.\r\n\r\nNowadays, software takes the baseline as the

    rather than the other way around. If that makes sense; might need visuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    something happening in Illustrator that I don't get. \r\n\r\nI type a line of
    (say) Palatino Linotype at 80pt, and the distance from the descender line to the
    ascender line is 80px. When I select the object, a box outlines the area the text
    is in, a hair below the descender line and 10px-11px above the ascender line.
    The \"transform\" tool tells me that this box is about 92px tall.\r\n\r\nI type
    the same text in another font at 80pt, I get 74px from descender to ascender.
    The bounding box is maybe 5.5px below the descender and 8.5px above the ascender,
    and the transform tool says that the object is 89px tall.\r\n\r\nObviously these
    bounding boxes in Illustrator have little, if anything, to do with the Bottom
    Bearing Line and the Top Bearing Line. I presume that these lines originate from:
    they were the physical edges of the piece of metal that the letterforms were carved
    into.\r\n\r\nSurely I'm not alone in finding this perplexing? I'd think that some
    standard for the vertical positioning of the letters would have evolved organically
    in the industry. And I'd think that design tools would make the bounding boxes
    of objects have some relation to that standard. What am I failing to understand

    a small x-height allow you to get away with tighter leading?</cite>\r\n\r\nI see
    Hrant did already answer this one with a resounding yes, but I had to look carefully
    to find that answer.\r\n\r\nTypefaces with a small x-height, such as the more
    authentic old-style faces, are commonly used without any leading at all.\r\n\r\nFaces
    with large x-heights <em>can</em> be used without leading too - this happens when
    space is at a premium, and a cramped appearance is accepted. But if the intent
    is to get an appearance that is good by the standards of traditional book typography,
    leading will be used.\r\n\r\nSo the advantage of a large x-height is greater flexibility.
    A face like Times Roman can be used for book typography - the fact that there
    will be wasted space between the lines that could have been used by longer ascenders
    and descenders is relatively minor. But unlike Caslon Old Style or Cloister Oldstyle,
    Times Roman (or, for that matter, Century Expanded) could <em>also</em> be used
    without leading to achieve a high density of text.\r\n\r\nSo a printer that can
    afford only <em>one</em> text typeface probably is better off getting Century
    Expanded instead of Caslon or Garamond. (Of course, there is Caslon 540 which
    does have stubby descenders...)"
