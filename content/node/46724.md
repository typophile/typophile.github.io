body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am having an issue with TTF fonts in PCs being displayed
  too small in MS Word and Bistream's font manager . (see attach)\r\n\r\nIn the beginning
  I thought I've made a mistake in the TrueType Metrics, but after reading in the
  FL Forum \"Tips and Tricks: Setting Font Family Metrics in FontLab\" carefully I
  realized this was not the case.\r\n\r\nThe fonts has 1000 units UPM and only if
  I set it with 2048 they are displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nI thought 2048 units were
  not mandatory for TTF fonts but apparently this is the case here.\r\n\r\nOr am I
  doing something else wrong?\r\n\r\nHave anyone had the same problem with TTF set
  with 1000 units? And which was the solution?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Hey!\r\n\r\nI found the problem. I wasn't related to the metrics but to the
    lack of proper \"PANOSE font identification\" data.\r\n\r\nThat makes fonts to
    look to small in MS Offices menus.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n "

    filled up the PANOSE info, BUT THE REST OF THE FAMILY CONTINUE BEING BADLY DISPLAYED.
    Now I think the changes were due to cached data.\r\n\r\nI still have the same
    problem using 1000 units or 2048. I have no clue how can I fix it. \r\n\r\nDoes
    anybody know what Font info values Microsoft Word takes in consideration to render
    the Fonts Menu?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."
