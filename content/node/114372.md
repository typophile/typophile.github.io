  appreciate some help, been looking for this font and just cannot find it. Maybe
  some awesome perosn on here has any ideas of what it may be. I am specifically concerned
  about the Q, that is the letter for that is the most unique and not identifiable."

    and Univers Ultra Condensed is most like this. It looks like perhaps they tweaked
    the R to remove the small curve at the end of the leg, which I see in the font.\r\n\r\n-
