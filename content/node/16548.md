body: "Good evening all.\r\n\r\nSo I know henna is a medium, not a style, but I'm
  wondering if anyone can help recommend an ornamental font (not lettering, but that
  might be interesting too) that evokes the traditional style of arab and/or asian
  body art. It needn't necessarily be authentic, just evokative. \r\n\r\nSo far I've
  come up with Altemus Arabesques;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/altemus/arabesques/altemus-arabesques/charmap.html\r\n\r\nwhich
  I think is interesting. Anybody else had fun/been inspired by this kind of work?\r\n\r\nTa,\r\nAnthony"

    recently, reminds of henna body art style maybe it is just the density of the
    ink or the casual yet confident penmanship. <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000054\">Olduvai</a>
    also has some of that feel.\r\nTim"

    stuff can be - there really is no substitute."
