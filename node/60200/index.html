  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,
 I was directed to this forum by people at FontLab, when I had contacted them with a very specific help request. So, here goes my help request:

I am an member/office bearer of a non-profit organization. We print out newsletter in a particular script (devanagari). I have a few fonts which are free for use. But they cannot be embedded. I had contacted the creator of those fonts and he mentioned to me that he was no longer looking after them. He also had suggested if I could find out a way, then I should go ahead and inform him as well. That brings me to this question. I have tried fontlab trial version and I can see that I can change the embedding option. The only need I have is enabling the embedding option for these fonts. Buying an expensive software just for this purpose will not be accepted by the organization. I was wondering if you would help me out somehow.

As you can see my only need is to enable embedding on the font files I already have. If someone can help me out it would be great. Thanks again. 
Regards,

Amit</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Welcome. I think your best option is to engage the creator to cooperate with a local experienced FontLab user familiar with the generation of the fonts and scripts you need. Getting help from someone here is another good option if the creator is willing to consent via electronic communication. 

Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As mentioned, I have contacted the creator of these files and he mentioned that he is now a "bit removed" from this. I do not think he specifically intended to disable embedding, but that must have been the default option setup by whichever font program he must have used. Also, if someone here is willing to help, I can facilitate the process of getting the consent. I already have his consent (he has asked me to keep him updated). I am pretty sure he will be fine with it. So, if there is anyone.. willing to enable the option for me/us... let me know. Thanks again.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestion. I did not know about this program. I tried that, but it does not allow me to change the embedding option. There is a drop down menu with just one item in it.. which is the current embedding option that does not allow embedding.
