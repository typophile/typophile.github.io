body: "Dear Typophiliacs,\r\n\r\nI am tasked with designing new logotype for a University
  Library Digital Center.\r\n\r\nThey have chosen Trajan as the preferred typeface.\r\n\r\nSome
  issues i'm trying to improve:\r\n\r\nthey often use an initialism: \"CDRS\" which
  \ (to me at least)  looks really horrible in Trajan, it looks like the 'S' at the
  end is going to tip over. I've tried to improve this by making outlines in illustrator
  and trying to stretch out the leg of the \"R\" --- how am i doing?\r\n\r\nalso in
  the fully spelled out words, there is another RS combination, which i tried to apply
  the same \"trick\" , but i wonder if it looks weird if that is the only R which
  is 'fancy'\r\n\r\nin the jpeg it has a few variations of size and some with the
  'fake' R leg, some regular, and the initialism in trajan pro and trajan pro bold.\r\n\r\nany
  feedback or critique is appreciated."

  body: "The swash R is interrupting the flow, in all versions. I wouldn't use it.\r\n\r\nOn
    the spelled-out versions, increase the size of \"for\" and \"and\" by 50% and
    drop them to the baseline of the rest of the type (I don't mind a size differential,
    but right now it creates too much of a hole and interrupts the linear flow).\r\n\r\nOn
    the stacked, spelled-out versions, try everything flush right (after you fix the
    size and position of the articles)--that is, move \"Center for\" right to align
    with the other two lines on the right margin.\r\n\r\nOn the initials-only version,
    the S looks off balance because you have too little spacing between the letters
    in general. Use optical, not metric, kerning and increase the letter spacing until
    it looks more balanced. And I wouldn't use the bold version of Trajan on anything."

  body: "Trajan is very poor choice here; it's about as undigital as you can get.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're stuck with it, for the acronym: either tame the leg of the \"R\" or make
    it descend to allow the \"S\" to get closer; try flipping the \"S\" so the top
    is bigger than the bottom and thus fits better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: If they want Trajan you should show concepts using it, but you could also
    show alternatives. Sometimes clients change their mind when they see other options.
    (Trajan was inspired by ancient roman writing and seems like an odd choice for
    a digital center.)

  body: Whatever alignment you chose for the three-line version (pity it doesn't have
    another word so you can divide it evenly), try to make sure the elements line
    up nicely above and below each other, from line to line.
