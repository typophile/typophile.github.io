  \u201Cwronged\u201D and it is a normal and healthy emotion, you have to handle it
  appropriately.  What we need to emphasized on is what we do with this anger.  It
  is time to seek help when you feel like your anger is not doing any good with your
  day to day life such as work, relationship, ability to achieve your goal and many
  more.  Anger management\u2019s goal is to learn methods and new ways to control
  your anger.  Many people who suffer from this condition come to seek help to deal
  with their problem but most of the time, fear, resentment, and unmet expectations
  that are the root causes for their anger.  Trough counseling the problem is addressed
  and the anger soon dissipates.  After, the client is able to be aware that they
  do not have to be controlled by their anger.  One more thing is that they are not
  being the \u201Cvictim\u201D of others or society but rather they are responsible
  for their own actions and behaviors.\r\n \r\nSome people just wouldn\u2019t want
  to show their real self so they stick with the reputation of an angry person or
  sometimes it is their way to resent from other people from getting too close to
  them.  This may result to people afraid of you or if not disrespectful of you.  Communicating
  your needs and frustrations in an productive and respectful way people will tend
  to listen more just to learn about your needs and frustrations.\r\n \r\nAs stated
  earlier, anger is a normal emotion.  The objective is to deal with the underlying
  issues and feelings indentified with anger.  And the next goal is to learn healthy
  ways to deal with this emotion.  Some may think that letting the anger out is healthy
  until they realize that the have secluded themselves from the people around them
  like relationships to partners, children, co-workers and etc.  Added the fact that
  this can have a very negative impact on the way others see and treat you.\r\n \r\nFor
  some instances, this type of behavior might be modeled from past experiences from
  family members seen while growing up.  You can do something to cut the cycle before
  your children might end up having the same problem and before you isolate yourself
  from others.\r\n \r\nIs it uneasy for you to compromise and acknowledge you\u2019re
  wrong at times? \r\n \r\nAccepting that you are wrong and compromising can be hard
  at first but consider that you cannot for all time get your way by being the loudest
  and most demanding. It does nothing but pushes people away.\r\n \r\nAre you afraid
  to let your guard down and allow people to truly see you for who you are? \r\nOther
  people are saying that if you wanted to achieve anything you must be aggressive,
  tough and in control.  Anger can have a repealing effect and sends you spiraling
  out of control.\r\n \r\nDo you believe that no matter what, you always have to be
  right and opinions and viewpoints of others are a direct threat or challenge to
  you?  Oftentimes we get mad because we observe behavior in someone else that we
  see in ourselves.  This brings up sentiments that we do not desire to appear at
  or deal with.  Underneath the anger may be hurt, disappointment, trauma and resentments.
  \ It\u2019s vital to become aware of how your body is reacting to feelings of anger.\r\n
  \r\nIf you sense your self get tense, \u201Csee red\u201D, find yourself clenching
  your fist and jaw, have trouble concentrating, find your breathing to be rapid and
  fast then maybe it is really time for you to seek help.  There are numerous other
  physical ciphers but these are a little you may notice.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.luuux.com/community/anger-management-how-deal-anger[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images
