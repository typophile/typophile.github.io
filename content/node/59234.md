  body: "I think there is something about the serifs that is a result of wear and
    not part of the font. Finding squarish narrow serif fonts with a serif on the
    middle arm of the E was not too easy, but maybe [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/pall-mall-rr/|Pall
    Mall]] Bold would work. You could use some sort of blurring effect and/or added
    stroke to further simulate the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
