body: "\r\nHi everybody,\r\n\r\nI should find out some more infos regarding the typeface
  I'm posting here. Whether a digital version exists already or if some of you has
  more images. From the quick research I did it should refer to Big Biba magazine
  of the seventies...\r\n\r\nany tip is greatly appreciated. Thank you\r\n\r\nAB"

  body: "Good find Fivos. Definitely a variation of the same idea.\r\nAs for the lettering
    designer for _BETTER AND BETTER_this may be Antony Little, who designed the logo
    for Biba circa 1968. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba The logo has the wavy
    lines of Picante and Marcel. \r\nDon"

    and seemed to be located in Carlsbad, CA, where Gail Conwell edited their Bright
    Ideas Magazine at that time. No legitimate way that I know of to acquire their
