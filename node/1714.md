body: Any ideas? It&#39;s for a packaging class. Identifont was way off, particularly
  on the &#34;G&#34;, which it thought was a &#34;Q&#34;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s usually
  not spaced this poorly &#40;I thought this would be easier to read&#41;, although
  it&#39;s definitely not going to win any beauty contests even in its regular form.

  body: Univers? Wow. Of all the faces to fiddle with. <BR> <BR>Thanks Yves. Now I
    have to figure out how to make it look nice. I wonder why they&#39;d go and do
    that when there are perfectly workable oblique versions. I mean it&#39;s not like
    they couldn&#39;t afford the whole family...

  body: Oh. 75 is the oblique version. Huh.
