body: I'm looking for a serif font to combine with Christian Schwartz' Graphik. I
  will need it for magazine layouts, and I will use it for shorter, and longer texts,
  as well as for headlines. I like Plantin, but feel the difference between Graphik
  and Plantin in x-height might be a problem. Minion Pro is much closer, but I'm thinking
  that a serif with a slightly(!) greater x-height might do well. And if it looked
  a little sturdier than Minion Pro does (like the feel I get from Plantin) I would
  probably like it. I especially like the lower case 'a' of Plantin better than the
  lowercase 'a' of Minion. I would also like it to be a font that works well over
  a wide variety of printing techniques and paper qualities. Am I asking too much?
  Or does any of you have any suggestions?

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. Those are great! The Iowan Old Style seems to
    me, unless I have understood the concept of x-height wrongly, to be taller than
    what I'm looking for --it seems to be about the same x-height as Plantin.\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment I lean towards Rawlinson."

    Magazine combines Helvetica and Plantin. Plantin is a Transitional (rather than
    a Modern). For me those two combine pretty well in Monocle. My reasoning was that
    I wanted to switch Graphik for their Helvetica, and then figured I would try to
    switch their Plantin for another Transitional with a lower x-height, to see if
    I could get a decent result. However, from what I read on Wikipedia, Helvetica
    is classified as a Neo-grotesque or Transitional or Realist, and I suppose Graphik
    is more of a Geometric ... Am I tweaking this in two different directions, here,
    getting a weird result? "

  body: "OK Martin, since you asked\u2026\r\n\r\nPlantin was something of a novelty
    in Monocle at the time.\r\nI suspect that it is a particular favorite of the designer's:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CWe
    knew we wanted a bookish, crisp white uncoated paper, and that a serif would be
    core to the look of the project. So Plantin was first choice, it has more character
    than most serifs, more charm, and holds ink very well and is hence extremely legible.
    The old style numerals and italics are really beautiful too, lowercase \u2018v\u2019
    is a particular favourite. Plantin also possesses, to my mind at least, that rare
    quality that it seems to elevate a simple typed word into a logotype. Something
    that Helvetica has achieved for a long time.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you should approach your project with the same depth of design thinking, driven
    by the criteria of the project in hand and personal taste, rather than merely
    tweaking someone else's design from several years ago.\r\n\r\nLead, don't follow,
    and trust your instincts.\r\n\r\nOK, so you like Graphik, that's a personal preference.
    So why not just pair it with a contemporary serifed face you'd like to work with?
    Perhaps they won't mesh immediately when you first drop them into the layout,
    but then you have to work to make it work.\r\n\r\nI recall when I first got hold
    of the digital fonts for Shinn Sans, which I had designed prior to DTP, and which
    were digitized by Steve Jackaman; I started using the fonts, and it looked like
    crap, and I felt gutted that my type design was too. But then I worked with it
    a bit, and it wasn't too bad after all. Best of all was the way that Andy Cowles
    used it in <em>Woman</em> magazine.\r\n\r\nSo what I'm saying is what I always
    say, that a font is a tool, and that its inherent qualities will only take you
    so far, because it's the typographer who adds the magic by experimenting with
    all the variables of layout.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Nick ... but ouch! When you contrast my pre-production backyard research,
    half-digested philosophizing and naive inquiries with the post-fact slick rationalization
    of Monocle's Creative Director, I feel like quite the dilettante. I guess I had
    it coming. :)\r\n\r\nWhat attracted me to Monocle's design on this occasion was
    the crisp legibility of the text. The text in the magazine I will be working on
    tend to be very academic and heavy (one could at times even argue that some of
    it is indecipherable). So, in order to make the material as available as possible,
    I wanted to pull the layout in the extreme opposite direction: while I might not
    manage to make it <em>easy</em> to read, I can at least create as few speed bumps
    as possible. What is more, I dare even hope that I can make it look good and attractive.
    Concern number two was that I have very little control over paper and printing
    quality of the final product, even less so because the magazine will also be available
    for download online, and thus some pages might be printed with all sorts of crappy
    printers on all sorts of crappy paper. That's why I need a type that \"scales\"
    well, by which I mean that it needs to work for low budget print jobs, while it
    simultaneously has a certain seductive finesse, some sort of low key glamorous
    mojo. This legibility was one of the reasons I chose <strong>Graphik.</strong>
    And <strong>Rawlinson</strong> appears to me to have the same quality."
