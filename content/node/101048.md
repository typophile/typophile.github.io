  body: "I believe it is a version of DIN. however, seems like the naming is a bit
    odd, so providing you with a specific name might be misleading. Perhaps another
    poster can assist, or you can check myfonts.com and locate it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/din/fonts/\r\n"

  body: Agree with Jodie. Also thought it could be DIN Condensed (mainly because of
    this /S) but as the sample is very small, I decided not to speak. Now I know she
    could think the same, I believe it could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engschrift|Engschrift]]
    (aka [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-1451|DIN 1451 Engschrift]]),
    a condensed version of DIN but different from the "regular" FontFont one. The
    big difference for this sample is the /O which looks to match Engschrift.

    tool shows this: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snap_5125.png]\r\nbut
    locating the right link and verifying is not my forte, especially when it comes
    to this font. \r\n\r\n:)"
