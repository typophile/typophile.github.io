body: "I have just made my first font, woo hoo I have exported it as a otf. Works
  great on Macs but on Windows it looks terrible. I am using Fontlab Studio and I
  have tried so many things to get it working correctly, but nothing works.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see it looks 'clumpy'\r\n\r\nI am thinking this is a common problem but
  i have not seen anything about it... so maybe it is not common. Please help :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture_6740.jpg]"

  body: "(David, I think Yixt is just showing Arial for comparison to the font on
    the first two lines.)\r\n\r\nLooks like a hinting problem. Or, it could be that
    some of the outlines are going the wrong direction. They should all be going clockwise
    for TrueType, counter-clockwise for PostScript. (The outer-most paths, I mean.)"

  body: Arial is a ttf, with TrueType outlines and True Type instructions, your font
    is a otf with postscript outlines and postscript hints. The Windows rasterizer
    with its Clear Type technology renders them differently.
