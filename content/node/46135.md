  body: "Holy crap Hrant, that table is the most awesome thing in the history of awesomeness.
    I can't afford it, but maybe a California job case endtable would fit me better.\r\n\r\nSorry
    for no input on the on the ID."

  body: "Andrew, glad you like it. For a smaller table you would use a smaller case,
    which would be harder to find than a California but still not really hard at all.
    I would recommend a caps-only case. Here's a web page showing a decent (but overpriced)
    collection:\r\nhttp://www.theoldprintingshop.com/typecase/\r\n\r\nIn terms of
    pricing, I'd estimate it to be about 2/3-rds of the full-size table, so less than
    $375 (but don't quote me just yet). But then there's the shipping (which can actually
    be tamed by shipping it in parts for you to assemble, which is in fact what Mark
    went for). Let me know if you're interested.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Regarding #1: If it started from some other font, I've never seen it. I don't
    think so. The design probably goes back to the 1920s, by the look of it.\r\n\r\nGiven
    that it's a precision tool company, I'm not surprised that it's the table guy
    who wants to know."
