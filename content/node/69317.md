  body: "It is quite nice, I like it very much.\r\nThe second delta does look better
    and balances beautifully on top. The right hand side of mu and pi would look better
    if done like the lower part of iota. Lowercase nu could look like the upper part
    of gamma. The lowercase lambda doesn't actually need these curls on top and bottom
    as it should be harmonious to nu, chi and gamma. There is more if you want but
    I hesitate just in case that overdo it."
