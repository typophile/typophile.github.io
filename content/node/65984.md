  Here's my issue.\r\n\r\nI took a clip art image and opened it in Illustrator-did
  the live trace and converted to live paint. This gave me a vector image. Then I
  copied this vector image and pasted it into my InDesign document and all of a sudden
  my swatch palette had all of these shades of CMYK in it. \r\n\r\nMy client discovered
  this upon preflighting my file and was not pleased as this is going to the printer
  today. Can anyone tell me how this happens and how I can avoid this in the future?\r\n\r\nThank
  you, Janet"

    > Place, and place your AI file in the frame. If you Package your InD file, the
    AI file will be in the Links folder.

  body: "Paul,\r\nI'm going to try what you've suggested, although the export colors
    to swatches was never on (I think the the default is to be unchecked).\r\n\r\nmatteson,\r\nI
    used to place, but have been encouraged to copy and paste as I've been told by
    several people that hire (boss types), there is no need to have a separate file
    if you are going back and forth from Illust. to Indd with just vectors. \r\n\r\nLet
    me try a couple of experiments and I'll let you know. Thank you so much for helping
    me. It's very frustrating!\r\n\r\nJanet"

  body: "So true! Thanks James. \r\n\r\nUPDATE! I was wrong in the conditions.\r\n\r\nIt
    wasn't a live trace thing. I'm sorry, I'm playing detective here.\r\nIt was a
    font (it happened in a few cases) that I converted to outlines.\r\n\r\nThen I
    added a default white pencil stroke and then did one of those subtract from behind
    things to give it a 3-D effect. \r\n\r\nWhen did the swatches come in? I'm baffled."

  body: "UPDATE AGAIN- I figured it out. \r\n\r\nSo-I'm a Photoshop queen, new to
    Illustrator. I was moving the \"K\" slider on the on the color palette, hence
    the cmyk swatches. Duh. \r\n\r\nHere's my final question for all of you experts...\r\n\r\nIf
    you change the swatches palette to grayscale in that pull-down menu, do you need
    to keep doing it or is the one time change like photoshop?"

  body: "Hmm - if all you were doing is moving the K slider around it shouldn't create
    swatches. Mysterious.\r\n\r\nSo if I understand you correctly you are trying to
    output grayscale?\r\n\r\nIf so Select All and then Edit-Edit Colors-Convert to
    Grayscale.\r\n\r\nAnother way to check on what swatches you are using is from
    the Swatch palette flyout menu. Choose Select All Unused and then Delete Swatch.\r\n\r\nThere
    should only be a few left, like Registration, Black, White, and perhaps a few
    other stock ones but all those swatches you listed in the original post should
    be gone.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Hi Paul, \r\n\r\nYes, I moved the K slider-then copied and pasted into INDD.
    Try it, it will produce a swatch. But yes, I am trying to output to grayscale.\r\nI
    didn't know about the convert to grayscale feature. Thanks so much. The most basic
    things are so elusive when you're not practiced in a program. \r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\nJanet "
