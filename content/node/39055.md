body: "How necessary is it to always have nodes at extremes of all glyphs?\r\n\r\nI
  have always put nodes at extremes and made the right extreme node the startpoint.\r\n\r\nBut
  when I try to put a node at the extreme of this shape (right leg of \"V\" & \"W\"),
  I end up with a really short curved segment. When I paste it into FontLab from Illustrator,
  it looses its fidelity and the curve gets wobbly.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to fix the
  tiny bcp even at FontLab's highest magnification.\r\n\r\nSo what happens if I get
  rid of that extreme node and make a node close to the extreme the startpoint instead?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/extremes_3971.gif]"

  body: If the line segment from which the curve is coming from is straight, doubleclicking
    the node should turn it into a tangentpoint and set the bcp straight again.

  body: 'If you use Illustrator to design your glyphs you should force Illustrator
    to use a grid which corresponds to the UPM settings in FontLab. Otherwise your
    curves will always look different when you paste them into FontLab. '

  body: "According to the specifications for Type One fonts, and I believe for CFF
    fonts, you do not need to have extrema on such things as the tip of a rounded
    e and c. This looks like a similar thing. I think you can do with only a node
    at the top with horizontal handles and a node lower down, not at an x extremum,
    with handles not vertical. The need for points at the extrema is because of hinting,
    as I understand it, and you are not going to have hints here anyway, I believe.
    But those with more knowledge of Type One hinting will hopefully chime in. \r\n\r\nI
    believe that most type designers (not all) draw directly in Font Lab or Fontographer
    for the reasons Ralf mentions. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Select the bottom node (in your screenshot), right-click (or shift-click),
    then select CONNECTION - SMOOTH. That should fix the problem...
