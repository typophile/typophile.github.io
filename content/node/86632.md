body: "I\u2019m looking into a good font family for clear numerals to display on screen.\r\n(project
  is an engineering instrument - will need to display words & numerals on screen ranging
  from 9-20px height @ ~150ppi - embedded fonts ok, not web/browser specific).\r\n
  \r\nI see a lot of discussion on the web about readability of crappy web browser
  fonts, readability of body text in print, Clearview for road signs - but haven\u2019t
  found any great resources for numbers and scientific data. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of any good typography resources where folks have rated/discussed readability of
  numbers? Any personal preferences or recommendations?  \r\n\r\nCurrently using Frutiger
  based on variety/weights, and it\u2019s doing well, just thought I\u2019d try to
  find out more before moving too much further along in the process. \r\n\r\nThanks
  all for any help or advice!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unfortunately, as far as I know, there haven't been any truly scientific
    studies on the readability or legibility of numbers. Studies on typefaces designed
    for optimal readability / legibility, like Clearview or the ClearType typefaces
    would probably work well enough. Frutiger too probably is well enough. \r\n\r\nThough
    it doesn't really answer your query, you might take a look at \"The Relative Legibility
    of Modern and Old Style Numbers\" by Miles A Tinker. It was a scientific study
    in the 1930s comparing Lining and Text figures. Might be of interest."

    info is more in-depth than things I was finding, so looks like an interesting
    read regardless of specific font-choice at hand. \r\n\r\nThanks! "
