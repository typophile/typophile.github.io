body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nsometimes in vintage style show bills or packaging, you see
  these self-contained words, generally \"and\", \"with\", \"to\", etc.\r\n\r\nI have
  attached an example, which is circled within the poster.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of a modern font specialising in this type of thing? I found one once, but can't
  remember the name. Plus, I don't know what the correct term for these \"self-contained
  words\" is, which makes searching difficult.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Intern_Poster_4175.jpg]"

  body: This came up once before but I can't find the node. One such typeface is <a
    href="http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PBroW.html">Brothers Word Logos</a> from
    Emigre. I want to say House has another but the old brain is just grinding when
    I turn the key.

    previously might have been more extensive... so if anyone knows of anything else?
