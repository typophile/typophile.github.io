		<div class="commentbody">I don't think we're going anyone a favour discussing whether a 'g' without an ear works while studiously ignoring the fundamental problems of weight, proportion, stress and consistency. It seems obligatory on the Typophile critique to find something nice to say about every typeface, and to limit criticism to details, but the fact is that this is a typeface with a hell of a lot of very basic problems. <BR> <BR>Graham, you need to go back and look at a lot more type much more closely. Begin with the uppercase letters* and concentrate on proportion and stress (pattern of thick and thin strokes). Letters in your design with extreme problems are A, J, M, N, P, R, U, and V. When you've figured out better proportions and have the stress falling in logical places (see especilly M and N), than start looking at details. Check the consistency of your serifs (B, P and R all have problems). The uppercase R probably has more problems than any other letter. <BR> <BR>From looking at some features of your design, especially the E and L, I see that Goudy has been a inspiration. Fred Goudy was occasionally a genius, but he has very little to teach anyone else: his work is idiosyncratic, and when it succeeds its a happy surprise. As a beginner, you would learn more from a more systematic designer like W.A. Dwiggins, Matthew Carter or Walter Tracy, in whose work one can see the logic behind the design decisions. Goudy was a kind of freak of nature. <BR> <BR>I recommend that you pick up a copy of Gerrit Noordzij's <i>Letterletter</i>. Don't treat it as a text book, and don't accept everything that it has to say as gospel, but it will provide you with the mental tools to understand what is happening structurally in a typeface. <BR> <BR>*I wouldn't nomally recommend to a designer working on a 'text' face to start with the uppercase, but I think it is a good way for a beginner to cut his teeth because the number of issues to deal with is smaller than in the lowercase. I think everyone's first typeface design should be caps only.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It isn't that this kind of design doesn't appeal to me: there are a few Goudy faces in a similar style that I really think are brilliant. I'll admit that I wouldn't be inclined to work in this style myself, but I don't think that's clouding my judgement. Note that I didn't make any comments about the style of the type, only about proportions, weights, etc. As far as I'm concerned, only the users of type really need to fuss about style: for me as a type designer, everything is in the details, and I think it is possible to examine any style of typeface from the inside out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Saying that the writing of left-handers writing in a particular direction (left-to-right) with a particular writing implement is not readable is very different from saying that left-handers are illiterate. Illiterate typically means unable to read, not unable to write readably. <BR> <BR>You ignore GN's statement that 'I encourage left-handed students to write with their left hand [as opposed to some teachers who still force lefties to try to write with the right hand], because they too should work under optimal conditions.' This seems to me a very long way from saying that left handers are 'uncivilised'. <BR> <BR>He goes on to to say that the broad nib is 'essential for <i>discussing</i> left-handed writing' [my italics]; he is not saying that everyone must use broad nibs, as you seem to be suggesting, but that the broad nib reveals the difference between left and right hand writing <i>in the same direction</i>. His point about writing downwards is that this is the only way for left handed people to obtain the same stress pattern that <i>readers</i> expect and are used to recognising in, ahem, boumas. He does not say anywhere that the result of writing downward is unreadable to themselves or to anyone else: he says completely the opposite, that it is only by writing downwards that they can produce something generally readable. Rather than being contra-reader (user) as you seem to be suggesting, he is saying the opposite: that in order to satisfy the reader a lefty with a broad nib needs to write downward rather than left-to-right. <BR> <BR>Basically, I think you have completely and utterly misread every sentence of this short piece, perhaps because you have convinced yourself that it is 'cryptic'. It is not: it is straightforward. <BR> <BR> <BR>I have not read Bilak's interview with Majoor, but I'm not sure that you are correct to identify the latter as a 'GN-er'.</div>

But at least it doesn't take me long to admit it and revert to rationality. <BR> <BR>Anyway, GN can butter things up as much as he wants, the fact remains that: <BR>1) When you can't read <i>your own</i> writing (because you're writing vertically) that's pretty bad&hellip; <BR>2) GN sees the invention of printing as a fall. This is not my idea - I got it from Kinross. <BR>3) GN never addresses <i>reading</i> to any usable depth. <BR>4) GN thinks that civilization depends on writing. Like your Eskimo friends are animals. <BR> <BR>John, don't be such an Ari Fleischer. <BR> <BR>&gt; I have not read Bilak's interview with Majoor <BR> <BR>Please do - it's very revealing. <BR><a href="http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html">http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html</a></a> <BR>And tell us honestly what you think/feel. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; The weight goes from upper left to lower right. <BR> <BR>But what about the &quot;Z&quot; for example&hellip; <BR>The exceptions to chirography even in type from chirography worshipers are so fundamental, that it's best to just make a clean break.

GN doesn't say that lefties can't read their own writing when they right vertically. He says it is *only* by writing vertically that lefties, if using a broad nib, can produce readable writing. Not just readable to them, but readable to anyone, because if they write from left-to-right the stress in their letters falls in an unfamiliar pattern that makes it difficult to read because readers, including lefties, are used to recognising bouma-shapes based on a particular set of stress patterns that developed from the writing of right-handed people. Writing vertically is not the problem: writing vertically is the solution.</div>

In effect lefties would have to learn <i>two</i> ways to read to get through the day. And for what? Because supposedly the only &quot;readable writing&quot; is that built according to the GN dogma? Ideological hogwash. Who today friggin' reads handwriting anyway?! <BR> <BR>The bottom line is that GN is telling lefties they should write vertically if they want it to be &quot;readable&quot;. It reminds of something he himself has said about Updike: How could somebody so intelligent say something so stupid? Simple: vested emotional/psychological interest. <BR> <BR>&gt; unfamiliar pattern <BR> <BR>At no time and nowhere has GN ever seriously discussed &quot;familiarity&quot;. And it's extremely funny that that same lame excuse is the foundation of both the GN school and the Emigre school, its nemesis! Of course, they're both wrong - because they've never taken the time to actually <i>analyze</i>. Artists. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

My interest is in understanding what Noordzij has to say, which so far has turned out to be different enough from what Papazian thinks Noordzij is saying for me to reject your interpretation. But now the conversation has become silly: you quote Noordzij without context and pronounce an outrageous conclusion that cannot possibly be supported from the text that you quote; I point out that what you quote doesn't support your conclusion, and suggest an interpretation that is better supported by Noordzij's words; you ignore me and begin again by changing the focus to the Perpetua d or the weights of Ruse or some other thing <i> that is completely without reference to the original ideas under discussion.</i> I'm sorry but I can't discuss this any more with you, since you repeatedly refuse to stick to what interests me, which is to understand. You say that I 'consistently side-step' most of your points; this is because I believe most of your points are red-herrings and empty provocations thrown up to distract me from the one thread of the conversation that I'm doggedly trying to follow.   <BR>   <BR>You wrote earlier that you argue because you enjoy it, not because you're right. I engage in conversations because I'm interested in understanding the subject of discussion, and know that other people, even people I disagree with, can contribute to that understanding.
