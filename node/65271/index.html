  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Typophiles,

This is my first post on here but I've been reading the forums a bit for the past year or so. 

Anywho, I plan on creating a typeface for use on the web and I haven't ever done that...sooo I was wondering if anyone had some advice from experience and examples if possible.

I've been examining Verdana's development and other current web standard typeface features, but I'm just looking for some things to keep in mind when designing this typeface. 

This typeface will be used as body copy and that will be its primary use. I might extend it later but right now the plan is just to develop a nice typeface for use on a website I'm creating.</div>

Does anyone have any pointers as to how to match a known pixel height to a UPM for very accurate alignment of line to pixles?

		<div class="commentbody">There isn't a lot of pixelfont action these days, but when they were "in" the accepted way to make them render out predictably was to shoot for 8 point (at 72 dpi) no matter how many pixels high the font actually was. For example my three sizes of Mana* all need to be set at 8 to come out right (you just need to determine the leading accordingly). Yes, it's a hack, but it makes -or at least made- things as controllable as possible.

Of course if your font is very large (which rarely makes sense though) you get in trouble, so you might use 20. Nothing in between works well* because Windows uses a nominal dpi of 96, so you want 75% (72/96) of the number to result in an integer. The problem with anything besides 8 is that the user needs to be aware of what size to use for it to click.

* Remember, it has to divide 1000 evenly.

Has anyone got 72 anymore? I think, the only clicking you might hear would be the sound of nothing happening. 1000? 125? 8?

I do admit I've been out of the screenfont scene for that long.

BTW, when I say 72dpi (or 96dpi for Windows OS) of course I mean
nominal resolution, not physical (which can be upto 250 these days).

		<div class="commentbody">Eh? The first line said; designing a web text font to work best at 8ths of an em, (assuming you're not also designing a style for each of the other sizes) is really small. Verdana! which was designed some 15 years ago is based on 13ths of an em, (though strictly speaking it's more attuned to 26ths of an em). This is, I think, a 96 dpi 11 pt?

Eh?2 The second line says how does it help an 8 ppm "web text face" to be scaled down to a 125ths of itself? 
i,e, if you're only concerned with the font's appearance at 8ppm, then 64 or 128 units per em is enough even for a script face, (assuming it's only intended for use at 8 ppm).

		<div class="commentbody">Just looked at Verdana which is 2046 UPM - so I would guess it divides down more evenly into unit 16units/ pixles (x80 to make the UPM). Though I might be understanding this wrong.

Yes, by setting 'Grid step' to 16 hits all the horizontals bars spot on, then there is a certain amount of movement elsewhere.
Everything seems to be a little bit off the grid (even straight verticals)- I guess consistently so. Perhaps after roughing in the glyph outlines onto the 16 unit grid then the process is to actually make the outlines look good aesthetically, (using your inert optical typographic principles) then control the lines - moving them back to where is required to viewing on screen with the hinting. This way getting the best of both world, however printing gives you a good looking font - though a bit round and square (like Johnstone's Underground), well you can't have everything?

Can anyone comment on the process?

T- has no sidebearings! - Verdana is an enigma...
