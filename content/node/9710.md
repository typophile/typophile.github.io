  body: The Alts live! <BR> <BR>Judging from all of the ID requests, they&#39;ll be
    popular. <BR>It&#39;ll be interesting to see how they&#39;re used and abused.

  body: Those ole&#39; Letraset transfer sheets must be somewhere in storage... Better
    find &#39;m and start turning out really awesome ligatured artwork! As long as
    the copy doesn&#39;t have e&#39;s and a&#39;s in it, I&#39;ll be fine.

  body: I usually modify N to create an A if I want that ligatured look for avant
    garde. Not the ideal solution, but it works in a pinch. <BR> <BR> - Lex
