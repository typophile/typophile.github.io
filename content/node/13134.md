  body: "I agree that it looks like it is a font, but it is one of our infamous 'hand-printed'
    font styles, and I do not recognize it offhand. In the FAQ, it has been pointed
    out that there are many, many such fonts, and that they are so easy and cheap
    to make, that custom lettering is always a real possibility.\r\n\r\nI will add
    that if you want to look for something similar, or if you want to take the chance
    to stumble upon it, I would look at the font samples collected in Part 11 and
    Part 6 of the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\" target=\"new\">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>. Use the Reference List to see who supplies the font, if you
    pick one out.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Quite close, if you tilt some of the letters and leave the others upright,
    is Forest King's <a href="http://www.will-harris.com/store-h/architect_fonts.htm"

    will give you a clearer look.

  body: "I think you picked it Mike. To me only the 's' doesn't seem to match up.
    Possibly from one of his other fonts, or a different version of this one? Looks
    like some new fonts to collect for the Guide. Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "No, it's not a match, Mike. This set was one of my earliest font purchases,
    so I own a copy of Scribble and there are lots of little differences. Still, I
    thought I'd mention it as a close alternate since, as you've noted several times,
    these handwritten fonts are a dime a dozen and finding the exact font can be a
    search for the needle in the haystack (which nobody really cares to hunt for).\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you'd like samples for the Guide that adhere to your format."

  body: "Mike, I'll accept your judgment, but they appear SO close it seems beyond
    coincidence. Can not having them side by side make them seem so much closer than
    they are?\r\n\r\nSince we don't seem to have e-mail anymore here at Typophile
    (why does this 'upgrade' feel so often like a 'downgrade'?), I thank you for your
    offer and say 'Yes please!' for Guide samples. You can e-mail through any of my
    web site addresses.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Will do. Don't think I've forgotten, though, if I can't get to it for two
    or three days.
