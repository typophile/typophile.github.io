<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was identifying a typeface, which I did, as Bickham Script. However though, as I went to MyFonts to testdrive it, I could notice that the one letter "l" there didn't correspond to that found at Identifont (and which is also the one to match my sample); i.e. <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=bickham+script&q=Go">Identifont's</a> "l" has a loop, whereas <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bickham-script/regular/>MyFonts' (Linotype's)</a> doesn't.
At first thought, I wondered whether that might eventually come from the fact that Identifont's Bickham Script was Pro, while MyFonts' wasn't said to be (thus I wondered whether those might eventually be two different "versions"). But as I could check at the other font vendors referenced at Identifont, everywhere Bickham Script Pro does actually have the loopless "l" (including at Adobe).
Then again, however, at both <a href=http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/408351/Bickham+Script+MM/detail>ITC</a> and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=408351">fonts.com</a> is found this other "version" of Bickham Script, Bickham Script MM (Multiple Master), and which in turn does indeed have the "l" with the loop.
(Checking back at <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/>MyFonts for Bickham Script MM</a>, though, which is referenced there to be the original font which the actual Bickham Script is based on, the displayed "l" is again loopless. I take it, though, that this is possibly because the "sample font set" they have at MyFonts for testdriving Adobe's Bickham Script MM is probably the same as they have for Linotype's Bickham Script, no?...)
So, after all the puzzling info found, I thought I'd ask for further enlightenment here, please?... :-) (Just hope it's alright to ask this here, in this section of the forum?... Since this is not exactly a type ID request... :-S) I wonder then, the "l" with the loop, in which "version(s)" of Bickham Script is that supposed to be found, in the end? MM only? And what then does this "Multiple Master" stand for, I also wonder?... (Would that be in some form a previous/preliminary version of Bickham Script, then, and from which today's version derives, to which the "l" has been changed to become loopless, would that be something like it?...)
Thank you once more. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know about the MM version, but Bickham Script Pro, the latest incarnation of Bickham Script has 20+ alternates of the lowercase 'l'. The default form is indeed the one without the loop. The variant forms are either contextually inserted (if the OpenType "Contextual Alternates" feature is active), or can be manually inserted through the Glyph palette (which is available in a few applications). A sample of 'l's follows:

<div class=commentbody>Alright, since you really want to know, I dug the archives and this is how it goes: the default 'l' form in Bickham Script MM (1997) is the one on the left, and the one on the right is the default form in Bickham Script Std (1999) and Bickham Script Pro (2004).

<div class=commentbody>Thank you for all replies.
Strangely, that other thread referred by antiuser didn't come up, as running a preliminary search for Bickham Script... (Still doesn't either... Hmm...) Would I have guessed that the Bickham Script lower case "l" "issue" had just been brought up just a handful of days ago... :-P
Then again, yes, I had also been through Adobe's Glyph Complement PDF for Bickham Script Pro. And yes, so I could see that it does have various alternates, not only of the "l", as well as of most of the other characters too (amazing in fact, the extensive variety). (And so that was in the end my "answer" all along: "simply" alternates. :-P To be honest, though, my thought then was that each of those alternate sets were part of their own individual font files, i.e. the alternates set, the beginnings set, the endings set, etc, each would come in their own individual font file in separate...) I got indeed only wondering whether eventually there was any particular/previous version of Bickham Script, in which the "l" with the loop was the default, for which why I wondered also about that MM "version" of it...
Thank you, still, to everyone, for all additional explanations; most appreciated, thank you indeed! :-)
<em>P.S. Ooops, I made a short edit to this post of mine from yesterday, and now notice it was moved up to "front in line". I'm so sorry for that, I wasn't aware that editing a post would cause its order to be altered in the posts sequence. :-S This does end up making the thread a bit confusing, now, I'm sorry again. :-S (This post of mine was originally in between Miguel Sousa's second and third posts, respectively from Aug. 16 and 18, i.e. previous to the one in which he displays the default "l" in Bickham Script MM and that in Bickham Scripts Std and Pro; please consider so, when reading this thread. And thank you for your best comprehension.)</em></div>

<div class=commentbody>I reported on this post-moving 'bug' yesterday, when I found that the same thing happened when I went in and tried to edit an unintentional double post. It moves the edited post to the end of the thread, but doesn't consider it a 'new' post, so if you intend the edit to be a new comment it won't bump the thread up in the list. You need to actually enter a new comment for the thread to be bumped up.
