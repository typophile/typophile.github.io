body: "What's up with Lcaron? \u013D It's used in the Slovak writing which means in
  certain tight fonts the accent is in danger of colliding with \u010D, \u0148 and
  \u0161. But when I look through Slovak text, it seems to show up at the end of a
  word of before a non accented vowel. Has anyone encountered issues with poorly designed
  Lcarons colliding or doing other naughty things to other letters?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother
  Lcaron question: is it important to try to match the style of the quotation marks?
  Example: if I have a font with modestly weighted accents and comically large quotation
  marks, would it make more sense to have the Lcaron's accent match the quotes or
  to match the rest of the accents?\r\n\r\nYet another: is it important for Lcaron's
  accent to vertically align to the quotes. Is it better if it doesn't?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lcaron_3658.jpg]"
