    \ (which I only know becuase it was in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16160\">another
    recent ID post</a>). \r\n\r\nThe other scripty part (\"marguerite duras, john
    hersey\") seems to be a different typeface though."

  body: "Oh, wait -- I guess you're right, Dav, now that I look at it again closer.
    (Sorry for the misinformation, Sebastian/absynthe). \r\n\r\nWeird... it's very
    similar though.\r\n\r\nWell then all the names are probably in the same typeface
    and would explain why the uppercase didn't match in 'Goodnight'."

    (on the right side, grey background)\r\nWell, I looked to the fonts and didn't
    find one that matched.\r\nFish and Nuke were the closest ones, at least for the
    few we can see.\r\nThe first font in my text sample make me feel of Mata Hari
    by Holland Fonts but it isn't. "
