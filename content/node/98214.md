  body: "All text looks like <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/bindlestiff-nf/|Bindlestiff
    NF]]</strong> by Nick Curtis (Nick's Fonts, 2011) a revival of <strong>[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/myfonts/7316615096/|Binder
    Style]]</strong> designed by Joseph Binder and released by D. Stempel AG in 1959.
    The |C| looks a bit modified.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. \r\nThat one is really close. It looks like the outer curves have
    a bigger radius on the original but seems to definitely come from the Binder-Style
    family. "

  body: Another similar alternative would be Raleigh Gothic. For something more modern
    you might want to check out H&FJ's Tungsten.

  body: OPTI fonts also had a BinderStyle that would work. Tungsten is not compressed
    enough to be close.
