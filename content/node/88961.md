  embedded according to the document information:<br>\r\nTimes<br>\r\nTimes-Bold<br>\r\nTimes-NormalItalic\r\n<p>\r\nI
  have been able to locate the appropriate font which allows me to edit the \"Times-Bold\"
  text, but I cannot find fonts which embed as \u201CTimes\u201D (aside from the Linotype
  version) or \"Times-NormalItalic,\" so I cannot edit that text. Any help would be
  greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n<p>\r\nThe 5 along with other characters are consistent
  with the Monotype versions of Times. Here's an example of the nonitalic form of
  the font (click for the pdf):<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://freepdfhosting.com/f09467203e.pdf\"><img

  body: I don't believe it's a Linotype version of Times since the number 5 in the
    document doesn't have the serif on the top-right tip. The number 5 is consistent
    with Monotype versions of Times New Roman. Also, Times LT Std (which I have) embeds
    as "TimesLTStd-Roman," not "Times."
