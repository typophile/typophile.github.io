body: I just learned of the concept of kerning. Now I am curious about whether one
  can change kerning in a typical word processor, like Word or MS Works. I do not
  see a kerning function in my MS Works. What is the nature of this adjustment? Must
  it be built into the font itself? Are there any programs that allow one to change
  kerning in a given font? Any general insight would be appreciated.Now that I know
  of this variable, I would love to be able to change it.

  body: You need a real typography program, like InDesign or QuarkXPress, to change
    the kerning of a font. As far as I know, Word does not even respect the kerning
    built into the font itself, let alone allow you to alter it. Unless this has changed....

    in any way neither for the font to provide it nor for the app to use it. Typesetting
    apps usually use font\u2019s kerning data by default if available, but can of
    course also impose any user tweaks or even run its own kerning algorithms. But
    that\u2019s for the typesetting apps, text processors are entirely different story\u2026"

  body: "Kerning has been supported in the Windows version of Word (and probably the
    Mac version too), since like forever, select \"Fonts\", \"Advanced\", and select
    the size at which kerning turns on. Kerning has been \"on\" by default in PowerPoint
    for at least the last two releases. \r\n\r\nChanging the kerning values built
    into a font is a different story. If there's a letter combination that you don't
    like you can turn off kerning and use tracking (called spacing in the same Word
    menu) to adjust the space between a pair or group of characters."
