  body: I don't know whether anyone has explored the site. Forgive me if this is common
    knowledge---I found on Google that there is another old mill, Gomez House, that
    is located on the same creek on which Deepdene was located. Dard Hunter lived
    at Gomez House from 1912 until sometime around 1919 or 1920.  The house is now
    owned and operated by a non-profit foundation.  I'm wondering whether the folks
    at the Gomez House know anything.  Their website is http://gomez.org/.

  body: "Marie\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip. I'll ask around.\r\n\r\nThere is already
    quite a good number of pieces of Goudy's work that had in the first weeks after
    the fire geen rescued by FWG's opthamologist. The man was also a hobby printer
    and was given permission by Goudy to go thrugh the burned-out building to collect
    whatever he wished from the ashes. He found a number of the cardboard working
    patterns and some sketches etc, which were scorched, but mostly intact. This collection
    he later willed to the University of Washington Special Collections. I looked
    through the work a number of years ago, and was thrilled to see what fine things
    had been saved.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
