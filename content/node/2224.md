  body: Or maybe <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madrone/madrone/testdrive.html?s=7&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Madrone</a>, although it has more contrast.

  body: You could probably approximate the font by beefing up a standard <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/clarendon-2/clarendon-bold-expanded/?s=7%20Lemons%20">Clarendon
    Bold Expanded</a> or stretching and tweaking a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/clarendon-2/clarendon-extra-bold/?s=7%20Lemons%20">Clarendon
    Extra Bold</a>. It has the same basic letterform.
