  \ However, the price is...daunting, shall we say, for someone who is interested
  in learning the craft as an avocation (I'm an engineer, and I see typography as
  an opportunity to apply math in a nearly-pure form).  Where and how might I obtain
  a used copy that I can purchase for a relatively modest price to try out (not interested
  in the demo version since I want to experience full functionality)?  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI've
  posted on eBay, with no results, by the way.  And I balk at downloading from any
  of the repositories like RapidShare: too high a probability of a virus/trojan, never
  mind that it's unethical/illegal.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    could also try to give Glyphs [[http://schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html]]
    a spin, as it's free (for now)."

    looks like a conventional Windows installer when the file is unzipped.  That leaves
    me rather puzzled as to how to install it, open it, and use it.

    Almost every glyph must be modified from simple geometry to look good, or even
    to look geometrical. There may be formulas underlying what looks \"right\", but
    we are very, very far from finding them. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Andrew (1985), have you drawn type? \r\n\r\nCircles can't be circular to
    look circular, nor squares square, nor rounds the same dimensions as squares.
    Dividing in half vertically visually is not equal in measure, horizontals and
    vertical strokes that are equal in width don't look so, and on and on. And this
    is the simplest stuff. \r\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing things to me I have
    learned in drawing type is that what we see is not what is on the page. Our brain's
    interpretation of data is a *huge* contributor to what we see, and that is not
    well understood yet.  "

    soon corrected by experience.\r\n\r\nWilliam, maybe the original poster is thinking
    of a different way of applying maths than you are?\r\n\r\nMaths and fonts can
    have many relations:\r\n\r\nIt can be <cite>prescriptive</cite> like in the constructions
    of the renaissance \u2013 this does not work, as we know, and I guess this is
    what you were thinking of. This is what mathematicians call a <cite>sufficient
    condition</cite> for what looks right.\r\n\r\nIt can be used to describe a <cite>necessary
    condition</cite>, like in the [[http://remix-tools.com/|RMX Harmonizer]], and
    I personally belive this is relevant and useful.\r\n\r\nIt can be used to <cite>process
    shapes</cite>, like the other RMX tools or MM or Superpolator do, and again, I
    think it does so successfully.\r\n\r\nFinally, maths can be used as a <cite>medium</cite>
    in which to describe or store shapes (i.e. B\xE9zier curves), and since we are
    working on the computer, this kind of maths application is not only sensible but
    inevitable."

    Donald Knuth's epos on TEX and METAFONT. He came at it from the very same angle
    you did. Reading these books will inform you and save you a great deal of time.
    The collected tomes come i a handy box-set: 'Computers & Typesetting, Vol. A-E,

    haven't used it yet.\r\n\r\nI took the original poster to be saying that type
    design itself is \"pure\" mathematics. And as of yet, not that much of mathematics

    know how I'll wind up using math and font design together!  I suspect a lot of
    it will be applications of analytic geometry, but that remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n@
    berkson: I suspect strongly that you're on target.  That is, (let's say) analytic
    geometry will get the basic forms delineated, but there will likely be the aesthetic
    aspect of \"that doesn't quite look right somehow\" that will yield modifications.
    \ So it'll be a blend (not sure what proportions) of math, engineering and art.
    \ Sue me...:-)\r\n\r\nAnd all of that, sports fans, is why I'd like to see if
    I could find a discounted or older used version of FontLab to give it a whirl
    and check out some ill-formed, hazy theories."
