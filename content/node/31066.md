  logo at the time was in Helvetica Black, below, but the building sign??? Maybe just
  a botched signmaking job? Those e's are way off.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metlife2_4088.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    supports of the building, and a lot of being able to discern the counters on the
    \"e\"s at a distance.  Not an effective sign if you can't read it at a distance,
    like from an airplane or a high-rise downtown....\r\n\r\n(I always prefered the
    PanAm logo anyway!)"
