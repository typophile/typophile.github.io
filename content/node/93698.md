  I've attached a small piece of reference of a sort of style I'm looking for but
  any suggestions of a simplified arabic script would be very welcome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref_4353.jpg]"

    could search for (square or geometric) kufi or kufic.\r\nYou could also post on
    http://typophile.com/forum/366 to see if someone can point you to the right direction."
