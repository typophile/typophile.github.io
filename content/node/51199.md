  cover, and originally I thought it was hand-drawn, but after looking carefully at
  other places in the magazine where it is used some glyphs seem to be repeated. Thanks\r\n\r\nhttp://thebosh.com/upload/2008/09/22/_zooey_deschanel_nylon_-_october_2008/Zooey%20Deschanel%20%20%20Nylon%20-%20October%202008-thumb.jpg"

    post samples from inside the magazine, especially of the glyphs you think match."

  body: "Thanks for all of your input, I think it may be a combo of hand-drawn and
    modified Mommie. The lower case \"o\" is very very similar while the uppercase
    Z is not at all like Mommie.\r\n\r\nI don't have the other instances of it, because
    I saw while waiting outside of a dressing room in urban outfitters ... i didn't
    buy it.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone else has suggestions hat would be awesome, but I think
    I have to just let obsessing on this one go.\r\n\r\nThanks"
