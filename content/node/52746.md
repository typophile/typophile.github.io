body: "Good Morning! \r\n\r\nHere is a barmy project of mine. I have undertaken it
  to research the compatibility (or lack thereof) of two styles of fonts I really
  like. So basically, I worked on drawing Didot upper-case letters with the rhythm
  of the Trajan font. I have made things more complex by adding a lower-case which
  works on the idea of the Trajan. Don't look too much at the figures, they have not
  really been worked on properly.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing your reaction and
  comments (so far, type-creators hate it and graphic designers are intrigued by it,
  because I made bold and non-fashionable choices, some of which I almost regret)."

  body: "I love the upper case. As far as the \"lower case\" goes, I guess I'm more
    a type creator than a graphic designer. It strikes me as in the same range as
    Peignot. There was a time when Peignot was used right and left for book cover,
    so perhaps your type would find a life there as well. \r\n\r\nBut the upper case
    as a titling font... That's what I'd use it for."

    (originally only the upper case, and then the upper case for 'subtitling') and
    you are right about the Peignot idea too. I just realised I wrote Trajan twice
    instead of:\r\n\"I have made things more complex by adding a lower-case which
    works on the idea of the Peignot.\"\r\n\r\nI may blacken the D slightly and round
    the leg of the R a bit, following some advice I received, then make the font available
    to whoever wants to use it (just mail me)."

    think I'd tweak right now is to pull the top of the S over to the left just a
    bit. (Since my name begins with S, I had to try it out!) The current version feels

  body: "Glad to hear you received the font. It is funny you should say that: I always
    thought that the S of the Trajan looked like a difficult exercise in balance,
    the very steep diagonal being corrected by the fact the loops seem to be falling
    the other way round. I have made two other versions of the S, but I think they
    don't work very well either: the lower loop seems to fall to the right and the
    upper loop to the left. I'll send them to you by mail so you have more choices.
    \r\n\r\nRe the long-tailed Q: it is not really complete, methink (hence the three
    parts are only next to each other and not linked) & works only with the Upper
    Case U. "

    where this type shines. \r\n\r\nAnd S is always difficult. I love the story of
    when Donald Knuth was first working on Computer Modern. He made several Ss and
    showed them to his wife Jill, whereupon she asked, \"Why don't you make it S-shaped?\"
    Only g causes me as much grief."

  body: "I think this is one of the more interesting faces to be presented here for
    a long while. A few things that I would consider adjusting would include making
    the A a little larger over all in both versions as it appears to me to be a tad
    small and light, the top of the A needs to cut through the cap height a wee gnat
    hair more as well. I would make the V a little wider and increase the size [but
    not the weight] of the O, Q, C & G in both versions. The serifs on the C are little
    too heavy for my taste and look at odds with the rest of the characters [I am
    not used to calling characters glyphs]. The tail of the Q is nice but I would
    also give it a tad more weight just to see how it looks with the other letters,
    this one is really just a personal thing and not a criticism. \r\n\r\nThe Z looks
    a tad heavy to me as well and the top curve of the upper bowl of the B could tapper
    further up the curve like the bottom bowl just a wee bit and although I also like
    narrow B, P & R I think the bowls need a little more air in them as they close
    up too much and look a little weak in the 'lowercase'- although this again is
    a personal thing. The bowl of the D also needs to be adjusted to match that of
    the O as it appears to me to tapper too quickly to the thin unlike the O, G &
    C which tappers a little more gradually.\r\nAt first look the S seemed to be a
    little out of whack with the top a tad too small, but I am in too minds on this
    although I have the urge to make it a little more graceful by increasing the size
    of top half, again to add a little more air in the curve as it closes just a little
    too much in the lower case and at a smaller size.\r\n\r\nVery nice work with a
    lot going for it."

    need to go back to my drawing board and see how I can use your advice to improve
    my font. I understand many of your comments but I am not sure I have the technical
    know-how to solve some of the problems: say I have failed to improve the D, which
    I agree is too light, mostly as a result of the horizontal thin line being too
    long. If you have a look at the first pdf, you'll see the upper loop was bigger
    but I did not manage to get an S which does not fall to the right as speter pointed
    to me. \r\n\r\nInteresting about the C serifs: do they shock you as much in both

    that blur the distinction between upper-case and lower case. What I like about
    the Peignot, as opposed to a font which only has small capitals like the Trajan,
    is that it preserves ascenders and descenders, which means the text still has
    a shape which is easy to recognise. In that respect it is quite the opposite of
    the way a font like Filosofia unicase works: in that case shapes are largely different
    but height is the same and ascenders + descenders have disappeared.\r\nI also
    like the way Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez's Anisette STD works. I want to work on
    a font with very similarly sized upper and lower case, with upper cases being
    far bolder. Not sure it will work!"

    Do they shock you more than the upper G serif?\r\n\r\nShock is not the word I
    would use, but they do stand out too much in both versions. No need to try to
    be different, just be yourself and go with your gut feelings. The upper G serif
    is lighter than those of the C and looks fine.\r\n\r\nWhen you say increase the
    size of O, Q, C and G - do you mean width only or height & width?\r\n\r\nHeight
    is the issue. These curved letters need to the extended above the cap height and
    below the base line to appear to be the same size as the other letters. The U
    also needs to 'cut' through the base line rather sit on it as it looks as if its
    floating above the imaginary base line. At the moment they look a fraction smaller
    than the other letters.\r\n\r\nSome doubt it is possible to produce a balanced
    font which is very vertical and has very differing letter widths. Not sure what
    people think on here.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what people think here either :) But
    as for different width letters in a font, I say go for it because that is what
    I do as par for course. I believe its the only way to get a visually interesting
    design otherwise you end up with something as ugly as Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI am surprised
    the leg of the R does not look too thick to anyone. Sometimes it seems to me that
    it works, sometimes it seems too dark... Erm. Not sure why!\r\n\r\nIt does look
    a little heavy depending on which way the wind is blowing. Usually diagonals need
    to be a little wider than verticals to look optically the same. Its a fine balancing
    act. If it looks a bit dark to your eyes, then it probably is, so adjust it and
    see what happens.\r\n\r\nAlso - what B & E do you prefer?\r\n\r\nI prefer the
