  body: I&#39;m a little confused about the 3 colored dots. The face mark looks like
    an abstract &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; mask. I like the logo type. Personally
    I don&#39;t like when websites include the url with the logo, but with the .net
    I can see why; maybe just add a smaller .net to the right of the &#34;q&#34; descender.
    Do you have to stick with the simplified face mark? I&#39;d try to avoid the cult,
    circle motif they current have on their site. <BR> <BR>-q

  body: 'I like the overall appeal of the logo &#40;I see that you have used the same
    font, which appears on the original logo and added some variation on the symbol&#41;.
    <BR>   As Michael said, the 3 colored dots are unnecessary decoration. The repetition
    of the company name below Chasque is a redundancy. Michael&#39;s advice to use
    just &#34;.net&#34; might be a good solution. <BR> <BR>If I compare the two logos.
    The conclusion will be that : You haven&#39;t made much alteration &#40;I see
    that you have changed the right eye with a circle and added something that looks
    like a brow to the left&#41;. <BR>The best thing about your re-design is that
    you got rid of the 4 face and tried to stick with one. <BR> <BR>Salute'
