  \"Armored Core.\" I had no luck when looking it up on my own, so a friend suggested
  posting here!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58866549/loading.png\">Loading
  screen</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58866549/system.png\">Menu
  titles</a> (possibly same as loading screen?)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58866549/income.png\">Income
  and Expense Report screen</a>\r\n\r\nIf anyone could tell me the typefaces, or even
  just suggest ones that are especially similar, I'd highly appreciate it! Similar
  open source/free typefaces would be preferred.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, could anyone identify
  <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58866549/nge.png\">either of these</a> as well?
  I thought I'd have more luck with them since they're from such a popular series,
  but I only ever found results for the main title's typeface.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be appreciated! Sorry if this is really obvious stuff to someone who knows more
  about it than me, but I'm really no good at identifying serif typefaces apart from
  the most obvious ones!"

      much, but honestly it's close enough for me!

  body: "I don't know how flexible is the forum software regarding user-rights, but
    a possible solution is to:\r\n\r\na) Allow all users to create new topics in \"Type
    ID Board\" \r\n\r\nb) Allow only admins to create new topics in the following
    sections:\r\n=> \"Type ID FAQ and Posting Guidelines\"\r\n=> \"Solved IDs\"\r\n(if
    possible allow normal users to reply in existing topics)\r\n\r\nThe most usual
    error I noticed on new users is to post an ID request in \"Type ID FAQ and Posting
    Guidelines\" section which will be totally avoided if the above rights scheme
    is possible.\r\nThis will also save a big deal of Riccard0's time for sure, which
    so patiently inform all new users to move their topics to the correct section
