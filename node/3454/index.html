		<div class="commentbody">Frank <BR> <BR>There are various methods of rendering finshed lettering. <BR>Calligraphy is of course written spontaneously in a controlled manner, and the more innate talent and  control a person has, the more beautiful the effect. <BR> <BR>Lettering for things like type and logos etc. are done with the use of drafting tools, although some very talented people can completely freehand the work with  pen and brush. Frederic Goudy notes in his writings that his work was all lettered freehand; even in his sparing use of straight lines. And keep in mind, that white paint is also  for the little glitches. <BR> <BR>Since almost everything I do now is drawn for digital fonts, I need do only a pencil outline for hand digitizing. <BR> <BR>When I did all of my work on board, my method was to draw as perfect as possible a pencil drawing of the work, and then I inked it in with India. <BR> <BR>I have always needed to use drafting tools to get good work. For this I have a wide selection of plastic circle and oval templates from small to very large. Along with that I have a very old set of twenty or so gentle curves. I am told these are tailor's curves, and my set is made of about 1/16&quot; hardwood. I recall that I found them in their handsome wood box in &quot;Tiger Ted's Junk Store&quot; in  a little town near my home. I have found these curves to be very useful in the rendering of long, slight curves, like the flair of stems in letters. This type of tool is still available in aluminum. I do have two or three sizes of French curve tools, but use them rarely. Small curves like serif brackets I have always freehanded. <BR> <BR>This is just a bit of personal info from one who has done it for more than 40 years. But you are wise to get hold of all the books you can on the subject, and to get the advice of others who have done inked work. <BR> <BR>I agree that a calligraphy course is of great value to a type designer, even if you do not intend to do strictly calligraphic work. The practice of writing forms is a fine way of getting your head around how letters come about. <BR> <BR>The tools I use are: technical pens, croquill pen, Winsor Newton Series 6 brushes (expensive, and are damaged by India ink, but you need to have good brushes) good quality India Ink, Opaque white designer's colour white or good white-out paint. <BR> <BR>Some prefer a perfectly smooth hot press board for a super clean line. I have always preferred a very slightly toothed board, because it gives me a little more control, and I like the feel of it.  <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Addison <BR> <BR>I use IKARUS from URW. The system consists of a tablet, and a hand-piece, with which you hand digitize your outlines.  <BR> <BR>I don't know how widespread is the popularity or use of this program, but I am hearing that other systems are much more in favour. <BR> <BR>Whatever program you intend to use, I believe that you can start at the drawing board rather than the computer and then scan and/or paste in your outlines. <BR> <BR>I am ignorant of the workings of other than IK, and have only a passing knowledge of Fontographer, and none at all of the other ones available. <BR> <BR>I would seek more info before you commit. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I must put in a recommendation for &quot;Creative Lettering Today.&quot; Michael Harvey's book addresses lettering by hand, carved lettering, and digital type design. <BR> <BR>For digitizing your letters, I would recommend the ScanFont + FontLab combination. It's not cheap, however. For a lesser investment, TypeTool is a good choice. Of course, given the hundreds of hours you have to put in to make a decent typeface, the cost of tools may seem less extreme. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can control quite a few variables of the ScanFont autotrace parameters, so you can make those decisions yourself to some degree. <BR> <BR>Whether or not you even use the autotracing, the main thing I always liked about it is that it has great features for taking in all the scans, slicing and dicing them and populating them in the glyph backgrounds for FontLab. <BR> <BR>I have not used the latest version of ScanFont, so I am not completely up to date. I haven't really needed it in a long time, so I don't have an excuse to buy it (or get Adobe to buy it for me). For previous versions, I found the autotracing a little frustrating for high-res scans, but I expect a lot depends on the quality of the original sketch or sample. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>
