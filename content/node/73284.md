  body: I've accessed OpenType features in Word 2010 Beta on XP without problems.
    I haven't tested all of them, mind.

  body: Word 2010 needs a DSIG table to make OT features work in TrueType-based fonts.
    An empty one is sufficient, though. (http://typophile.com/node/29770#comment-266702)

  body: I'm using the release version of Word 2010 on XP sp3 (in Parallels). The opentype
    feature menus are disabled in every font I've tried (including the MS system fonts)

    XP) don't have any features. I would expect Calibri and Gabriola (supplied with
    Office) to expose the features. I'll point the Office folks over here.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    numeral styles and ligs do, too."

  body: "OK, it took me 14 months to figure this out: \r\n\r\nIf the top of your Word
    2010 document window says \"Compatibility Mode\" \u2014 as it will if you open
    a document created in an earlier version of Word \u2014 Word 2010 will disable
    the OpenType features (to preserve layout compatibility with previous versions).
    \r\n\r\nTo fix this, go to File > Info > Convert and upgrade the document to Word
    2010 format. Then the OpenType features will activate."
