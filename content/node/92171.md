  looking for a font that is easy for the eyes, interesting to look, won''t bore the
  reader and also has modern look. I will use it for setting long as well as short
  texts. '

  body: "Not to pick nits, but Times New Roman was first released in 1932, which places
    it squarely within the era of Modern Poetry, Literature and Art. If you're looking
    for type with a more \u201Cwith-it\u201D vibe, \u201Ccontemporary\u201D would
    be a better and mores descriptive term."
