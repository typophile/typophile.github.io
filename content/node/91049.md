body: "What are useful available resources for learning how to script within the type-design
  process? I'm well aware that I'm missing out on automation opportunities as I go
  through a font glyph by glyph expanding each stem by three units in each direction.
  :-( I'm comfortable in the abstract with the idea of programming, but I have never
  done any work in Python. \r\nIs there a beginners' guide somewhere? Or simple example
  scripts?\r\n"

  body: "This is a good place to start:\r\n\r\nhttp://robofab.org/talks09/index.html\r\n\r\nMost
    of not all of the examples can be run in the macro window in FontLab. You just
    type or paste-in the script, and hit the \">\" button. The results appear in a
    separate output window. \r\n\r\nFWIW, there are better apps for trying out Python
    stuff. I like TextMate. Terminal works, too. Just type \"python\" at the prompt,
    and away you go. OTOH, it makes more sense to be in FontLab, Glyphs, or RoboFont
    to do stuff with fonts (at least when starting out)."

  body: "Python's capabilities go far beyond what you need to make use of it in font
    production. Several books I've bought on the subject seem to assume I'm going
    to use it to program web apps or scientific apps or shell scripts or something.
    They oftentimes spend a big portion of the book going over platform-specific IDE
    issues and working with different add-on packages and tools. This is overkill
    for font development use. Most font editors let you run Python in them directly,
    so you probably don't need to set anything up (except for maybe Robofab and FontTools)
    in order to start working with it. \r\n\r\nI would recommend either of these books:\r\n\r\nLearning
    Python (O'Reilly), by Mark Lutz & David Ascher\r\nPython for Software Design:
    How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, by Allen B. Downey\r\n\r\nThe second one
    doesn't assume you know any other programming languages.\r\n\r\nThere is also
    a decent tutorial at python.org: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/ \r\n\r\nThere
    is also DrawBot, which is used to teach Python at the TypeMedia department of
    the Royal Academy in The Hague: http://drawbot.com/index.html"

  body: Craig, if you learn to script, can I put a request in for [[http://typophile.com/node/89340|this]]
    as a fontlab plugin (for windows - sorry, I was brought up with PCs and find Macs
    very difficult to use). Or anyone else for that matter. Don't know how lucrative
    scripting for font designers is but I for one would license it.

  body: "If this is your first foray into Python on FontLab, don't try to install
    and learn RoboFab immediately. If you don't have experience, installing it (particularly
    on a WinBox) can be problematic and will just deter you from proceeding further.
    Just try a few lines directly in the FontLab Macro Panel and start to understand
    the syntax and FontLab classes.\r\nStart with something simple like\r\nf = fl.font\r\nfor
    g in f.glyphs:\r\n print g.unicode\r\nand experiment with things on http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/\r\nLearning
    Python (O'Reilly), by Mark Lutz & David Ascher is an excellent resource for learning
    the basics of Python.\r\nOnce you discover the limitations of FontLabs own classes,
    you may then want to dive into RoboFab if you feel the need.\r\n"
