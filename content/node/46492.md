body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nJust got a job redoing pretty much every visual aspect of a
  5 person architecture firm based in New Zealand. They specialise in sports centres,
  education facilities and houses using a modern style; lots of use of corrugated
  sheet metal and glass.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for a font that might
  fit in with the kind of stuff they do? Added bonus if it's produced locally here
  in NZ. It'd be used for everything - website (doesn't have to be web-safe, was using
  flash for the website anyway), printed material, drawing annotations, and also their
  logo\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nRafe"
