  years I have mainly concentrated on making Flash-based creations. Only this year
  I wanted to practice Indesign CS3 (learned working with Quark 4) by typesetting
  our yearly news-flash (family stories about 2007). Now I only happen to have some
  questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Now I have set the paragraph first line indent
  property to 1p5. Only how can I cancel out this setting for the first paragraphs
  on the pages?</li>\r\n<li>Are there any rules regarding punctation in (sub)headers?
  Do these punctuations have to be aligned with the body text somehow?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\np.s.
  I am not convinced it's in the correct category, if not. Please let me know!\r\n\r\n(The

    properties based on your regular one, except the indent).\r\nThere you can also
    specify which paragraph style is next. \r\nThen, you can select all of your text,
    right-click on your \u2018first paragraph style\u2019 and select \u2018apply this
    paragraph style and then the next one(s)\u2019 [sorry, I don\u2019t know how they
    named it in English or Dutch].\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the CS2 way; I don\u2019t know
    if there\u2019s something new in 3 \u2026\r\nF"

  body: "Hi Florian,\r\n\r\nNo worries, about the Dutch naming. I only used Quark
    and Indesign in the English version... I would become clueless if we starting
    to use the Dutch terms. Anyway, you are totally right, though. First I tried to
    get it working with nested styles, only that didn't work well. Because this feature
    doesn't support Paragraphs and the accompanying paragraph styles.\r\n\r\nBeside
    of I have a question about the usages of em dashes. In the text there are a few
    sentences which use them, only one causes so bad flow. Anyway how to solve this
    (see pictures below) ? How could this problem be avoided or solved (easily) ?
    \r\n\r\nThe problem is clearly visible in the first screenshot where the dash
    is at the end of the line, which doesn't make it look better. Only the break is
    mandatory because it's the end of the column.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/streepjes_1_3882.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/streepjes_21_4258.png]\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "If the break is mandatory, there isn't much you can do about it, is there?
    I have never understood why a dash falling at the end or beginning of a line is
    considered so bad. There are a lot of \"rules\" that have come about because someone
    thought a particular situation would confuse a reader, or just looked bad. The
    usual argument against dashes at the end/beginning of a line, from an aesthetic
    point of view, is they weaken the text block. But so do ends of paragraphs, and
    we put up with that. Moreover, in the ragged setting you have shown, the text
    block has no clear right edge.\r\n\r\nHowever, in your screen shot, the emdash
    appears to be spaced with a word space. If you are going to use such a long dash
    (em), space it with a hair or thin space. If you are going to use a word space
    around the dash, use an en-dash. Better still, a few fonts have a dash 3/4 of
    an em long, and that, thin-spaced, ties the line together rather better.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    some people claim a dash can be mistaken for a hyphen (when at the end of a line
    and being too short \u2013 not in your case) or a listing dash (when at the beginning
    of a line; like a bullet point, especially when there are several cases in succession).\r\n\r\nI
    second what Charles said: your breaks take up <em>lots</em> of space. Emdashs
    <em>can</em> be quite elegant, but take care that they don\u2019t tear holes in
    your text. The spaces before & after should be small and, moreover, even! (Look
    at the 2nd line: \u2018Theorine \u2014\u2019 vs \u2018Han&nbsp; &nbsp;\u2014\u2019\r\nF"

    or alternatively an ndash with word spaces. I\u2019ve been told former was the
    traditional Anglo-American way, latter was more common in Europe \u2026 In the
    end, it depends on your taste <strong>and</strong> the typeface in question: some
    fonts have a ridiculously short ndash that makes it unusable for parentheses,
    others show a very long mdash that looks odd in running text.\r\nTrust your eyes,
    not the old watch list! ;\xB0)"

    former was the traditional Anglo-American way . . .</cite>\r\n\r\nActually, it
    was the Anglo way, not Anglo/American. Richard Eckersley (of British origin) use
    to have \"discussions\" with the editors at Nebraska Press, where he was senior
    designer, about quotes & dashes. Initially, he preferred the style common in the
    UK, where dashes were set as word-spaced en-dashes, and a single quote was used
    in places where those in the States use a double quote. We finally convinced him
    (honestly!) that a 3/4-em long dash centered in an em space (i.e., 125 unit l&r
    sidebearings) looked best of all. Never got him to change his mind about the quotes,
    though.\r\n\r\nAs you say, trust your eye."

  body: "I'm talking book work here.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the 'Anglo' way is that
    it produces a more even colour on the page. An em dash, irregardless of the spacing,
    leaves a bullet hole through the page, and if there are more than two or three
    per page, can impact the even colour that we try to achieve with small capitals,
    old style numerals, and titling fonts for headings. "
