body: "For a journal i have to design for september, i have choosen Storm's Lexon
  for body text. I wanted a solid face with a lot of personnality, and i think it
  works well. But Lexon is tricky to marry ; its bold being a sans (and headline)
  doesn't make choices easy. I want to use the headline version for the main titling,
  but i would need some others* \u2014 one for alternate titling, and some for specific
  titles, etc. And the more tricky thing is to find a good little texts sans, which
  would have ideally to be part of the alternate titling familly. I have quite the
  desire to find another serif as a compagnion, but matching two text serif looks
  hard to me. I have also thought about scripts which would have suitable versions
  for short texts, and i'm virtually open to any idea, all the more as i haven't to
  make that choice now.\r\n\r\n*ideally, if i had had some money, i would have loved
  to make Mr Storm expand the family to cover all i want, but\u2026"

  body: "It could match, i just have tested the possibility as i own a version of
    it, but i find it too pretty, too delicate, for this issue. The journal is the
    satirical one i speak about here : http://typophile.com/node/19122\r\nI d'like
    something more expressive, (Dyna is, but not the way i want).\r\nThanks."

  body: "MMm, i didn't know Maple, it's very nice. But i don't know if it's not too
    wide for journal titling.\r\nSophisto, i 've been thinking very seriously about
    it. I have tryed to use the pdf to make simulations on a specimen layout, but
    it not very easy. Stefan, i d'love to have french specimen in all styles, with
    dispay and text for testing it. [i looked at oxtail too]"
