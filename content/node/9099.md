  TrueType, Macintosh PostScript or Open Type?  &#40;Each is a separate purchase.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>The font is to be used with an iMac 700 in OS 10.3.6; printing on either
  an HP 1200se monochrome laser or HP 5650 inkjet color; and using applications InDesignCE
  or Word 2004. <BR> <BR>Reddaddy'

  body: Any of those formats, or Windows TrueType, should work fine in that environment.
    <BR> <BR>In the really long run, I believe OpenType or TrueType is likely to be
    better supported &#40;like 10 years from now&#41;. <BR> <BR>Other considerations
    might include what language support and additional typographic functionality might
    be available in the different formats. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: It isn&#39;t an echo. You know that though, don&#39;t you? It is just a result
    of hitting the &#34;Preview/Post Message&#34; too many times. If you get an error
    always remember to reload the page before hitting the button again. Chances are
    it will be posted.
