  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a natural antidepressant designed for effectiveness rather than minimal side-effects, to be sold in shops. I&rsquo;m looking for a sans for packaging and a serif for an unusually full and friendly guide to usage, accompanying a titling sans that would ideally be the same as that for packaging, so the two need to pair well. The guide will include a course of boiled down cognitive/behavioural therapy and be more of a little book than an ordinary medication insert.</p>
<p>The packaging sans must be readable and recognisable from a distance, and of suitable character - whatever you think that should be: I&rsquo;m interested in what you would want if you needed such a product. The serif should be inviting but authoritatively non-contemporary - certainly not in the least po-mo or cute - and surprisingly beautiful. Though it shouldn&rsquo;t be as rootedly and obviously historical as a Caslon, actual great age isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be really grateful for ideas; I haven&rsquo;t, after much searching, found a good solution yet.</p>

<p>For the documentation, I presume it is something more user friendly than the usual tightly folded pamphlet in microscopic print that typically comes with prescription drugs (a serif font would not be suitable there). Give Leawood a shot.</p>
<p>*(Of course, naming drugs has to be done very carefully, such that one can&rsquo;t be mistaken for another even when written in a doctor&rsquo;s handwriting. There have been too many tragedies with people getting Prozac instead of Prilosec and even worse substitutions.)</p>

Unfortunately there are too many drugs with soundalike names, and at least in the U.S. the drug makers don&rsquo;t try very hard to choose names that don&rsquo;t sound like anything else. One reason I got out of medical transcription is that I was expected to be able to read the doctor&rsquo;s mind &amp; tell whether s/he meant Avelox, which is moxifloxacin HCl, a quinolone antibiotic, OR Aveloz, an unproven cancer drug. Or Murelax, a tranquilizer, OR MiraLax, a laxative.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the actual purpose of this thing is more important than the fact it&rsquo;s a medication. Imagine you&rsquo;re a genuinely depressed non-designer: for weeks or months things your chest has ached with psychosomatic misery; you can no longer remember or imagine feeling pleasure, but can still feel relief; you&rsquo;d rather not see your doctor to get a prescription antidepressant, and you drag yourself to the chemist perhaps to get some of that St John&rsquo;s Wort you&rsquo;ve heard about, but quite likely for some other reason. What would you go for: a box labelled Zibexoline set in Daxline, or another called Soul Healer set in, at an extreme, Storm Sebastian? It&rsquo;s a genuine question, and the answer might lie between the two.</p>
<p>Gerard Unger is interested in people&rsquo;s attitudes to medication, and they&rsquo;re usually terrified of them, finding their inserts - set in Times, Helvetica or Frutiger - particularly inhuman (too authoritarian, too distant, too ignoble?). This must go double for any psychiatric medication, which is one reason for the popularity of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; treatments.</p>
<p>I reckon inserts also fail to answer most of the questions people want to ask: what exactly is this doing to me, and why? What might I feel like, in all respects, at first, and for how long? Does this fade out gradually or suddenly, and does it coincide with a similar transition to wellness? How will I feel in the long term? What&rsquo;s the likelihood of each side-effect? What&rsquo;s the likelihood of the medication&rsquo;s working, wholly or partially, and when will I know? What should I do if it doesn&rsquo;t work at all or in part, or if it feels too strong, or if I do suffer from common or rare side-effects?</p>
<p>So the guide will be detailed, authoritative but not authoritarian, kindly and concerned but not presumptively and joshingly intimate, and noble-spirited; it will be immaculately set in some suitable and, as I&rsquo;ve said and in particular, <em>surprisingly</em> beautiful serif with sans titling. But which? To give an indicator, even Deepdene might not be too much for the serif.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks both of you. I think this is a project for which the obvious is less good than the (obvious) avoidance of the obvious. No product has as much emotionally invested in it by its user, and needs to be more inspiring of hope, than an antidepressant. For one thing, there&rsquo;s the placebo effect to consider.</p>
<p>The best bet for the serif I&rsquo;ve seen so far is LTC Kaatskill - what a good-looking type, by the way - rather than Deepdene or Goudy Old Style. I&rsquo;ve never been much of a Goudy Old Style fan, though the LTC version is certainly eye-openingly superior to whatever version(s) I&rsquo;ve seen in print. Bliss certainly has the right name&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that perkiness, which is common in the work of the last fifteen years, is no good for this. Kaatskill is perkier than is ideal, but I haven&rsquo;t found anything better yet. Bembo book, my default choice - just because it&rsquo;s so much better (I do believe in better and worse) than all but three or four text faces - is too distant; perhaps JY Aetna could work? With Haarlemmer Sans? For the name, &ldquo;Soul Healer&rdquo; is probably a bit much, too: &ldquo;Mood Healer&rdquo; is perhaps better: it at least cuts straight to the point. Other ideas are very welcome.</p>
<p>Actually this is my own product: I&rsquo;m aiming to start a little company to produce it, having come to learn far too much about the psychopharmacology and biological psychiatry of mood disorders following my own rather in-depth experience of one of them. Trying many medications without success may have biased me; perhaps the suffering is less, and the expectation of reasonable but not total efficacy greater, for most people considering a non-prescription antidepressant. In reality, it&rsquo;s more common for antidepressants to work brilliantly or not at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yup, Palatino Sans is really impressive: creamy and expressive, and thanks for the idea.</p>
<p>Mind reading is rarely infallible, even for computer <em>geniuses</em>. I&rsquo;ve been advised to market the antidepressant to professional, web-forum depressives first, over the internet - so anywhere. Based on studies of a combination with the same mechanism of action as two of my components have, it should be effective for at least 60-70% of even clomipramine- or phenelzine-resistant people, and it&rsquo;s getting that mechanism from a herbal extract plus an amino acid that&rsquo;s my hopefully patentable big idea. With good reports from the chronically ill, I&rsquo;ll aim for UK shops. Selling things to the big chains of chemists is a nightmare in the UK, and I imagine in the US too, but to do a substantial amount of good for both humanity and my finances it&rsquo;ll have to be done.</p>

Haarlemmer sans is friendlier than you&rsquo;d expect for a JvK derivative - I think friendlier than the fabulous Romulus Sans (now there&rsquo;s something worth viving).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi George,</p>
<p>I made comment in the &ldquo;type for a chocolate company&rdquo; thread that I think is relevant in any &ldquo;type for a _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; thread:</p>
<p>In essence my point was this:</p>
<p>There is so much that contributes to successful graphic design. Type choices are an integral component to be sure (and much beloved by us all). However, I think it is a mistake to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m designing for a children&rsquo;s clothing line&hellip; let&rsquo;s start by selecting a font.&rdquo; I realize you&rsquo;re giving us additional info here, but what would be most helpful is to see your design direction. We need to know what your idea is. Show us your bottle, is it tall and skinny, is it short and stubby. Tell us about the illustration you&rsquo;re going to use. Is the emphasis NATURAL anti-depressant or is it natural ANIT DEPRESSANT? These will decide what the type choice should be.</p>
<p>For example: You can sell tea using Priori ala Tazo, or you can sell tea using Helvetica ala Stash, or Windsor Bold ala Celestial Seasonings. These packaging solution accomplish a design goal and carve out a niche on the shelf. I doubt Sandstrom design started with Priori. Maybe, but more likely they started with a direction: the language of alchemy applied to brewing tea. And the results are much stronger for it I think.</p>
<p>In other words:
Bembo could work.
Sauna could work.
Beorcana could work.
Or they could all flop.</p>
<p>The more you give us, the more we can help.</p>
<p>Good luck!
Randy</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Randy, you&rsquo;re absolutely right, and can probably tell I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer.</p>
<p>In truth this will be a natural ANTIDEPRESSANT, but would a large proportion of people, given the fear of side-effects or mind-distorting euphoria, and especially among those going &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;, prefer something that didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;THIS IS HARDCORE&rdquo;? The commonest requests among patients coming to a doctor about their depression for the first time is for a &ldquo;potent&rdquo; or &ldquo;mild&rdquo; antidepressant - which it more often I don&rsquo;t know - even though there&rsquo;s no such distinction among first-line antidepressants (and no possibility, unless they&rsquo;re bipolar, of euphoria). 
It seems that it&rsquo;s products about which customers have no fear of side-effects or overkill, like (ridiculous) branded ibuprofen, that are most likely to be packaged as hardcore.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a pic of the kind of thing the image could be like.![](/images/old-images/Wheat 5 small edited_4985.jpg)</p>
<p>Text will be in the sky, of which there should be more, covering the top half and a bit of a large 3x2x2 card pack about the width and height of a small paperback. The whole package should look high-end, aptly expensive, since the product will have to be more expensive than competitors. Inside will be smaller card packs, labelled just MH for discretion&rsquo;s sake, to fit in a handbag, each containing a week&rsquo;s supply of tablets. Tablets will be dark, shiny, rounded, not the gel-caps usual for natural stuff.</p>
<p>Here is a potted history of antidepressant branding. It&rsquo;s pretty funny in the early stages. The progress is obviously from illustrating depression to illustration happy-happy joy-joy.</p>
<p>Nardil, the original (1950s) and still the best:
![](/images/old-images/Nardil 1_4412.jpg)</p>
<p>Tofranil, just after:
<img src="/images/old-images/tofranil_5820.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Anafranil, a 70s (?) competitor to Tofranil:
<img src="/images/old-images/Anafranil_4393.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>The modern rubbish: the latest SSRI and the best branded natural antidepressant, Amoryn. Stylised suns or actual sunlight are the commonest images for natural antidepressant branding.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>(Somewhat tangential)</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in the USA, and it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;herbal&rdquo; product, it is not regulated by the FDA, nor is any sort of testing required, for either safety or efficacy. If people taking them have negative reactions or health problems due to the product, the makers aren&rsquo;t even required to report it to the FDA.</p>
<p>About the only time that regulatory agencies come into it is if the claims being made are so blatantly false that they amount to false advertising. Sometimes the FTC will step in and halt ads in these cases. There&rsquo;s actually been a <em>lot</em> of this with weight loss products making blatantly false claims and getting fined for it. (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CortiSlim)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CortiSlim)</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to &ldquo;natural remedies.&rdquo; I just wish they were tested for safety (and preferably efficacy as well) to the same degree as &ldquo;drugs.&rdquo;</p>

I used Bell Centennial Address for a good quantity of tiny text, too: it&rsquo;s seriously well-made, and is magically efficient and legible at 7.6 pt. I tried out lots of small-text types, and though Bell Centennial demolished the competition, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/158369/sansno1-font.html">Sans No 1</a> is a nice bit of old-school work too. The front panel, which is now the only image, looks like this so far: it&rsquo;ll need tweaking, and the colours of the floriation might change.<img src="/images/old-images/mh_5757.png" alt="">Any ideas for what changes might be made? Once again, I&rsquo;m no graphic designer, so I shan&rsquo;t be offended by anything.</div>

<p>I had been trying to figure out what doesn&rsquo;t quite work about the difference case between the two words. On reflection I think the problem is that there is no difference in importance between your two words, but there is a difference in case, so the difference in case raises a subliminal question in the mind of the reader that there isn&rsquo;t any answer to.</p>
<p>Also the old style numerals here look too big, giving the number of capsules too much importance, as if the fact that there are 168 rather than 150 is a big deal.</p>
<p>It may also be that some kind of further treatment of the Bliss&ndash;a fine outline stroke?&ndash;might help. It is lovely, but not quite &lsquo;there&rsquo; is my feeling.</p>
<p>Still, if you don&rsquo;t find a better solution, this is good enough to go with.</p>

<p>I just got an idea on how to preserve that and create symmetry in &lsquo;healer&rsquo;. You could have the final R as well as the H in healer as a cap, the rest small caps, so &lsquo;mood&rsquo; and &lsquo;healer&rsquo; align. Then you could try putting a stroke across the leg of the R indicating the &lsquo;Rx&rsquo; symbol. Maybe it will be too corny, but it might be worth a try.</p>

I would also look at removing or reducing the weight of stroke on the circle. What kind of bottle or package does this appear on? I wonder if a circle is the best shape rather than, say, a horizontal ellipse, I see a circle working better on a package with an overall squarish appearance while an ellipse might work better on a taller package.</p>

Neither is one allowed to use the word &ldquo;antidepressant&rdquo; (though one major competitor does so illegally), and it&rsquo;d be sensible to use the word &ldquo;depression&rdquo; only with an addition to the disclaimer pointing out that it can refer to a mood state as well as to a depressive disorder. &ldquo;Mood&rdquo; is not off-limits though, and &ldquo;depressed mood&rdquo; is exactly what one can claim to heal/remedy/soothe/any other word without formal medical significance. The medical definition of major depression, for instance, requires more than depressed mood alone: one can have &ldquo;depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful)&rdquo;, <em>and</em> &ldquo;markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day&rdquo;, and yet not qualify for DSM-IV major depression, because that diagnosis requires at least two further symptoms. Only 54% of those reporting both depressed mood and anhedonia actually qualify for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. In casuistic theory, it&rsquo;s the 46% who miss out who ought to be taking Mood Healer. In reality, it will treat major depression, and, according to the research behind it, it should have no difficulty in matching or exceeding the 19% superiority of current first-line antidepressants to placebo.</p>
<p>The real problem with the name is that it&rsquo;s rubbish. Any suggestions for a better one that says as clearly what the tin does?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben, I agree. This product of mine is, sadly, quite safe. There are about a dozen naturals with extremely promising results in rats, making them potentially much more efficacious than St John&rsquo;s Wort, say, but with no safety record in humans. I&rsquo;ve not considered using them.</p>
<p>Thomas, the UK is slightly stricter than the US, and bans nutraceuticals common there which are known to be potentially unsafe, like Kava Kava. More efficacy and safety studies would be lovely, but the cost for naturals is exorbitant. No little company can afford the literally hundreds of millions of dollars spent on trials that the FDA requires for new prescription antidepressants, no pharmaceutical company is going to do the work, and, in the UK, NHS research on naturals accounts for only 0.1% of their total medication research budget. Nonetheless, there are small trials in the West and trials from Russia, substantial data from real-life use, investigation in hospitals of the sources of any med-induced problems, and impressively thorough academic investigation in China where &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; medicine is of course mainstream. We know, for instance, exactly how many cases of liver toxicity have been attributed to Baikal Skullcap there over the last thirty years (4, out of hundreds of millions of patients), and whether there is any inherently liver-toxic compound in the herb (no; problems are due to exceptionally rare genetic abnormalities).</p>
<p>On the other hand, almost all nutraceutical formulae for the treatment of specific medical conditions are either fraudulent (especially with standardization claims), incompetent (bunging in everything with any far-Eastern reputation, randomly dosed) or only minimally effective (if only through inadequate dosing).</p>
