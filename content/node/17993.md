body: While doing other legal research, I came across the case "Masson, Seeley & Co.,
  Ltd. v. Embosotype Manufacturing Co.", (1924) 41 R.P.C. 160 [1923-28] Macg.Cop.Cas.
  99, mentioned in "Copinger and Skone James on Copyright". According to this case
  based on the 1911 Copyright Act and dealing with a catalog of type, it would be
  illegal to depict fonts as it is done in books on typography and at various typographic
  websites. In my opinion, this old decision was a misjudgement, inasmuch as the court
  held that an alphabet of type, though it has no meaning in language, is a "literary
  work". If this were so, then any font depicted at Typophile, e.g. as attachment
  to postings, would constitute a copyright infringement of a "literary work".
