  so I wasn't all that concerned when a hip hop client requested that I create a cover
  design for his next LP/CD ... called ashes to ashes. \r\n\r\nHere's the line work,
  which dollar symbol do you think works best??\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/ashes2ashes_5a.jpg\">\r\n<img

  body: "Thanks riccard0, I think so too. It flows better, but I had to try the full
    vertical dollar symbol stroke tho. The tension it creates is nice but that's exactly
    what gets in the way of the flow.\r\n\r\nBonus for trying the full dollar symbol
    stroke was that I found the word: \r\n\r\n$he \r\n\r\n...and all the off-spring
    words coming from it, lol!\r\n\r\n\r\nn."

    me.

  body: "Four dollar signs seems to make it too predictable. What about a progression?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ashes2_3908.gif]\r\n\r\nBTW,
    is that a fist? If so, what about varying the knuckle heights to make it clearer?\r\n\r\nAlso
    check out this, from one of my most favorite foundries:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/progress/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hrant, thanks for the inspirational comments bro. Ya, I wanted to say /fist/
    without pushing the 2/thumb vibe either way ... this or that ...and the knuckles
    too for that matter.  \r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the linkage, Alias Collection Klute
    is great, diggin' Pop also!\r\n\r\nI'll try strengthening the grip of the fist
    by graduating the dollar signs from center outwards. and for that matter the letter
    shapes and knuckles too.\r\n\r\nPredictable is a good word... stable, is another
    as in not dynamic enough. But the last thing I want to do is get comical about
    it. \r\n\r\nn. "

  body: "Hip hop is a lot about the $, so I would go all the way and use it.\r\n\r\nI
    feel like the progression idea is getting in the way of symmetry, and people like
    symmetry.\r\n\r\nAs said before I think the type should be more bad ass. Maybe
    it's a cool idea to give it some perspective? Along with your 'wings'.\r\n\r\nYour
    fist indeed should look a little bit more like a fist."

  body: "I like the first one best too. Not sure about the progression tho, I thing
    symmetry is cool here. \r\nAnd about getting all bling bling and rapper with it,
    well it depends. I 'd say if they want to go all gangsta you probably need more
    richness to the details but if they're more ol'skool you can make it simpler.
    \r\nDon't think you need to go fo' the graffitti thang -you made me laugh wit
    ya style Christopher Dean!!! :D\r\n..Sorry, I had to. \r\n\r\nKeep it legible,
    simple. Make it stand out amongst a bunch of cluttered stereotypes. This Mos Def
    cover was just that, not flattering but to the point. Tru that ;)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/412682-mos-def-black-on-both-sides_4209.jpeg]\r\n\r\n"
