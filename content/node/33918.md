  body: Almost certainly custom or pre-digital. Have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=bauhaus&sample_text=POWELL%20PERALTA&sample_size=36">ITC
    Bauhaus</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process/bryant_2_pro/&sample_text=POWELL%20PERALTA&sample_size=36">Bryant</a>.

  body: Found a much closer match. David Buck must have used the photo typeface in
    question as inspiration for <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/ruby/?refby=typographica">Ruby</a>.
