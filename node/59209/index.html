"If you want to import directly from a Windows installation, you'll find the fonts in the C:\windows\fonts directory. Copy all the .ttf files to a USB stick, create a new folder in your/home directory called .fonts (note the period before the word fonts!), and place them there. And that's it. The fonts will now be available in all your applications." 

It's sad to see such ignorance around font licensing. If this chap had suggested skipping the middle man and downloading a pirate copy of Windows and the applications I'm sure the article would never have been published.

these young kids think that, just because they can copy a file,
they own it, and just because there's a lawn, they can play on it.

c. 1998 versions of some fonts are available in a package hosted on sourceforge. Pointing people to that package is  a lot different from advising your readers to copy "all the fonts" from a friend's Windows machine (which will likely contain 3rd party fonts along with Microsoft fonts not part of the package) onto your Linux box.   </div>

_thousands_ of _thieves_ for every one honest person
who knows how to stand within the bounds of the law.

and that's a _fact_...

how can we succeed against such overwhelming odds?

no wonder our society is in such bad shape...

their face-spaces they don't even realize the scale
of the huge problem their lawlessness has created.

look, one of those thieves appears to have

more minimization of their flagrant abuse of the law.

whichever word someone might decide to describe it,
these kids are using something that they do not have
a legal right to use, in disobedience to the true owner.

and if you tried to "educate" them, sii, why i do believe
they'd just chuckle at you -- if not laugh in your face --
and run off and make fun of the old legal fuddy-duddy.

"hey old man, i suppose you drive the speed-limit too!"
i can just hear them taunting you.  and it's not pretty...

heck, look at the very evidence you have mustered here:
bald piracy instructions listed right in an article that was
printed in a glossy magazine with a large print-run and
also in a big prestigious newspaper in the nation's capital.

		<div class="commentbody">You can split hairs with EULAs, and be technically correct, but if we're talking about ethics, I don't get it. I see little rationale in getting upset about this. 

I feel no guilt whatsoever in downloading a given album (let's say the Clash's London Calling) that I've bought on so many formats over the years (vinyl, CD, cassette). I would have to try really hard to feel guilt over using a Windows licensed fonts on a Linux install when there was zero effort on the creator/designers' part in making that possible. (Assuming there are no added support costs, etc.)

So, I know I'm letting ethics trump the law in my choice to re-download music that I justify by feeling that I'm entitled. But, maybe you can help me see it from your perspective.

Assuming someone has properly licensed the original fonts, what do font designers lose from this behavior in the article? What does Microsoft lose?

		<div class="commentbody">Joe, if you interpret the article as someone transferring fonts from a licensed machine <STRONG>they own</STRONG> onto a unlicensed machine <STRONG>they own</STRONG>, then I see your point. It's kind of like a studio licensing one copy of Photoshop and installing it on 20 Macs - at least they licensed one copy. Adobe got paid.    

However, the article doesn't talk about this. It is advice for someone who is running Linux, and who has not paid for Windows or Mac OS (both OS's include these fonts). People who legitimately licensed these OS's have paid for the fonts.

The author could have suggested using fonts from an unused copy of Windows, ebay, or given the sourceforge URL. But he didn't. 

Does that make sense?  

And back to the point of my post. All I said was that it's "sad" that the chap didn't have a better grasp on font licensing, and that his ideas were published in a mainstream newspaper. Ethics discussions aside, I just can't see how that it's good for the font community.   

EK> Simon, if you’re going to quote someone, quote fairly.

Well don't make inflamatory stuff up then. Saying that people who use Open Source OS's are less likely to pirate applications software is like saying the Pope wears a funny hat. Most Linux apps are Open Source making piracy impossible.

First, Sii, when you say "the article was about running Windows apps on Linux - which would imply a different box," you seem to not quite understand what WINE does; WINE is precisely about running Windows apps that are sat on a local hard disk of a computer that booted GNU/Linux. WINE stands for "Wine Is Not an Emulator," and so it does indeed require moving the fonts, because it allows running Windows apps without Windows. 

Moreover, the article also says "Fonts that are not supplied as part of [the core fonts] package, but which some applications might need, include Tahoma and MS Sans. <b>You can find these around the web if you search.</b>" 

(And, it does include the sourceforge URL, btw.)

I see the point as quite obvious. The article is open to two interpretations, one benign, and the other encouraging infringement. Given the preferences of the overwhelming majority of open source users, I prefer the benign interpretation.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree the article author is blissfully unaware about software licensing. 

"why the talk of downloading fonts from the Web and USB sticks then? Surely Linux can read the Windows partition?"

GNU/Linux can read and write VFAT and NTFS, yes, but WINE isn't designed to search the filesystem for Windows' own files, it is designed to run without the presence of Windows at all. Thus the need to copy Windows fonts (other I think sometimes other files, like some hardware drivers) into places where WINE can make use of them.

"And to be clear you think the advice provided in the article is completely kosher from an open source perspective?"

I'm not an advocate for open source, I'm an advocate for software freedom, so I find the whole WINE project to be an own-goal - it promotes proprietary software. I'd rather than articles like this weren't written and instead articles were written explaining what the free alternatives to proprietary applications are, or proposing the initiation of projects to develop them. 

So I'll join you in criticising the article for popping off into the web to find unlicensed copies of proprietary fonts, although I guess we part ways when I say that I'd rather the article said "we don't have libre fonts that can replace Windows' fonts, so please consider starting a project to develop them" :-)

Developing a roman and an italic is the course requirement, but that isn't a family IMO.

		<div class="commentbody">You are again quoting unfairly. What you are citing is not my first response, and it's not even the relevant part of the argument.

The gist of it, again, is that the article might fairly be interpreted not to encourage willy-nilly copying of fonts, but as a way to run fully licensed applications (including the fonts they require) from an open source platform. I think it's a fair interpretation (a more reasonable one in context) since few users who are pirates flock to open source: they stay with their illegal copies of windows and windows applications. Open source users tend to be people who want to be legit, but can't or don't want to pay for software, or strongly prefer free software. If a user is reluctant to switch to Linux because there's a Windows application that they must run, the article tells them how to do it.

I may be wrong about any of these matters, but it's certainly no reason for you to get upset.</div>

oh, so you were serious, and not just kvetching.  good for you.

in related news, the r.i.a.a. wants to charge a.t.&.t. whenever
