  makes fireplaces.\r\nIt is translated to: \"Fireplaces - Our house\".(this order

  body: "I am not over keen on the mix of type widths or the spacing changing from
    very spaced to very tight. The R in NOASTR\xC3 is a bit awkward at the join of
    leg and counter. The colour pallette, while \u201Chousey\u201D in a brick-like
    way is not very warming. Technically you might want to check out how it works
    at small sizes, for example a business card, and how you resolve a black and white
    version.\r\n\r\nTim"

    and White. \r\n\r\nThe gap between \"Casa\" and \"Noastra\" is huge. \r\n\r\nThis
    also appears as 2 separate logo types, like Seminueri is a co-brand/sub-brand
    of Casa Noastra.\r\n\r\nFinally, Where is the logo being used? Is it on the actually
    fireplaces construction, or just on the packaging? If it's on the fireplaces,
    how will it be applied? Is it going to be etched in the metal? Is it going to
    be a separate placard attached to the metal? "

  body: "Thank you very much for all the replies.\r\n\r\nI have made some changes.
    I have changed that \"R\" and some adjustation to the spacing where made.\r\n@Asvetic:
    the logo won't appear at all on the fireplaces, it will be used only for promotion,
    so to speak. The company insisted that the word fireplaces to be emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"weird\" gradients where included for a \"3d-ish\" look. \r\n\r\nI have attached
    the 3 versions of the logo: with gradients, without them and black&white.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoFinal3_4105.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So, Fireplaces <i>is</i> a sub-brand of Casa Noastra? \r\n\r\nIf so, you
    might want to consider trying to persuade the company to invert the names, Semineuri
    on the bottom and Casa Noastra on top. Hierachy rules. Also you might want to
    consider making Semineuri a smidge smaller, it's currently contending size wise
    with Casa Noastra.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't an option, you might consider doing a
    version where Semineuri doesn't look identical to Casa Noastra (maybe using a
    serified font, and keeping the point size reduced to signify that Casa Noastra
    is still more important than Fireplaces.)\r\n\r\nI'm curious what you mean by
    promotion only."

    It won't appear on the products. This is what i meant when i said \"promotion\".\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to do my best to try and convince my clients to move \"Semineuri\" back under
    \"Casa Noastra\", where it was before.\r\n\r\nThank you a lot for the suggestions."

    letter of the second line, do the same with the S-cedilla and the \"C\" at the
    beginning.\r\n2) Make the cedilla vertical.\r\n3) Increase the word-spacing on
    the second line.\r\n4) Fix the spacing of \"NOA\".\r\n5) Tighten the \"EU\".\r\n6)
    Bring the accent on the last \"A\" inside it, and if it's a tilde make it wavy.\r\n7)

  body: I prefer it without the gradients, actually like the charcoal-grey colour
    you used in your last but one. Also, I'm not sure about moving the accent on the
    A down so it looks like a crossbar. It looks like a mistake because all the other
    A's don't have these - and it doesn't look like an accent because it's too far
    down the character. Other than that, I quite like it!

  body: "I agree with duckworth. The accent in the middle does look like a cross bar
    instead of an accent. I would put the accent back on top. Separator line is now
    shorter so it may not interfere with the accent so much.\r\n\r\nRegarding the
    colour. I prefer the non gradient one. Gradient doesn't really give the dimension
    to it. It washes it out. You could maybe try with non blurred pass from lighter
    to darker. It will look more glassy and therefore classy and definitely not washed
    out.\r\n\r\n...Robert"

    attached the final version. I put the cap on top of A, because, even if when put
    inside the letter, it looked better, but on another hand, users aren't used to
    the fact that the cap isn't on top. \r\n\r\nAnd of course that I have removed
    the gradients.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoFinal5_all_4595.jpg]\r\n\r\nHave
