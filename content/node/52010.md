body: "Oh hai! For my last semester getting my BFA in Graphic Design, I am signing
  up for an independent study to design a series of four display faces and one text
  face based on the four quadrants of Knoxville, TN (I'm not going to get into the
  particulars of the project anymore on here... it's not really relevant to my question,
  I suppose) and I have to write a proposal/time-line/statement type document outlining
  the project, goals, research etc... I was wondering if anyone out here would know
  of any other well done projects (not that I want to steal anyone's ideas about the
  DESIGN, more or less I am just looking for good organization, tone of voice with
  copy, reasonable time frames, etc...), books, articles, websites, ANYTHING really
  as sort of a jumping off point for me to scan through whilst writing my own... Comments/opinions/questions,
  etc... would totally be appreciated as well. \r\n\r\nI suppose the things that I
  am thinking about are ::\r\n* Should the proposal be a thesis where I am PROVING
  something in my design efforts (that the travel of monied areas in Knoxville throughout
  the last century\u2013from east to north, from north to west, etc... can be traced
  by the different visual aspects of the signage in said areas)?\r\n* With these typefaces
  I hope to create a system wherein the text face complements all four of the display
  faces, but in talking about my proposal, should I emphasize more the historical
  significance and research or should I put the emphasis on the usability and legibility
  of the typefaces themselves? I really don't want to make a Sufjan Stevens \"this
  is a project about a particular place\" typeface\u2013I really want these to ultimately
  be very usable fonts that are important outside of the context of Knoxville.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure that I will have about a million more questions, but the coffee has set in
  and I have to get back to work. If anyone has anything to add, just want to say
  thank you so much in advance.\r\ns.e."

  body: You might find the <a href=http://www.typefacedesign.org/2008/>specimens</a>
    from the typography MA program in Reading useful. Though their focus is on displaying
    the fruits of their labor, what they write about might help you see how much to
    focus on the theoretical/research side and how much on the desired result.
