  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Typos,

What are people's thoughts about having a business card which is landscape on one side and portrait on the other? Does anyone have examples of this? I'd like to hear pros and cons of such a layout.

I did a little quick research into how people hold/handle and flip cards, and was quite surprised that there are actually a number of different ways people do this.

Honestly, I don't think mixing them is bad at all, as long as you aren't ingnoring any usage issues specific to the project. People tend to get conservative out of fear, rather than actual needs, with their business cards. If it fits the project, I say go for it.</div>

I used to agree with that until work with a very talented salesperson/account manager a few jobs back.

He pointed out how truly functional business cards can become and that they really need to fit the proper use. His main point, which I've found is fairly true, is that many, many folks still use rolodexes and, as such, it's only a good thing to have a landscape card with all the pertinent info on one side.

A flash b-card is still a great ice-breaker/memory-sticker, of course, so I now tend to make one side of the card practical, the other side flashy.

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting topic to come along as i am addressing this issue currently.

I have a graphic treatment along with the identity in front in landscape. Then i have two versions of the back, one an appointment card and the other a business card, but both have the name and contact material on both. I tried to make it landscape, but it came off looking odd since I didn't want to use a light background. So i kept the format horizontal. This by the way is for a salon.

I understand the practical reasons for perhaps not rotating type, but maybe we all are thinking too much when there suddenly has to be a conceptual purpose to designing a vertical business card. I have a card from MetaDesign and i really don't think there was a conceptual purpose behind it other than differentiation. Is that conceptual enough?

		<div class="commentbody">I'm developing some stuff right now where 'being able to write info on the back' was desire voiced for the design. This pretty much eliminates dark/lush colors on the back, which is common for two-siders. It'll be conservative, but that's not a bad thing by any stretch. It's what's called for. I agree with blackbirdsign that concept and practicality really are married for business cards and sometimes the concept is catching the eye and mind of the recipient, even if they are inconvenienced at the rolodex.

If any of you have Punchcut's business card (it happens to by laying on my desktop as I write this), they've got a portrait info side, landscape fluff side, type in different directions, and a slightly slimmer format. But all of these moves work with the very restrained type to show personality and interest without looking like a novelty or a little circus. Plus, the design allows them to be distinct but still have their name in big red caps for the rolodex users. Sacrifice a bit of convenience for a bit of distinction.

If there's no reason not to make a business card stand out, why wouldn't you?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone for your responses.

I guess what it comes down to is what is appropriate for the specific project/task.

In the case of a current corporate identity on which I'm working, the "fluff" side worked better in potrait considering the type layout and messaging -- whereas the "info" side was obviously best done in landscape.

I've just posted the card, letterhead, and envelope over here:

http://typophile.com/node/14500

I'd appreciate your fedback before I take it to the client (SOON).

Thanks again.

		<div class="commentbody">I've had several cases where the front of a b-card was landscape and the back was portrait. My opinion is the left side of the front needs to be the top of the back. This works well for right-handed people. Also, there is a real world example of this that has been in use for many years. Your paycheck – all checks for that matter. Top of one side with the left of the other. That's my take.

Strangely, I had an argument with a printer who kept ignoring my instructions on how I wanted this type of card setup. He insisted, as a matter of standards, that they always oriented the two sides right side to top. 

I've handed this type of card setup to unsuspecting people and watched how they flip it over. They get it right about half the time. </div>

What are the views of 'non-traditional' card sizes?

We normally don't work with a size that is larger than the standard convention (3.5" x 2").</div>
