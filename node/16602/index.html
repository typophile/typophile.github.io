This would be only about 25-30 years ago. The version I liked seemed to resemble Michelangleo a little bit, but of course had a lowercase version.</p>
<p>Some of its features as I remember&hellip;</p>
<p>• the lowercase e had a much more pronounced diagonal cutoff at its corner
• the gooseneck on the numeral 1 was much more pronounced
• the thin parts of the zero were roughly diagonal from each other; the zero in the present Palatino™ has its thin parts almost vertical from each other</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were more differences, but&hellip; am I imagining things here? Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>
<p>By the way&hellip; I love this site. I thought I was the only one around that obsessed about this stuff!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal are two families that complement Palatino nova perfectly, and which I hope will cause quite a stir. But they are not finished yet, and they will be released later.</p>
<p>I think that this is because Hermann Zapf sees Palatino nova as a family in and of itself… it is his definitive reworking of the entire Palatino family. D. Stempel AG advertised all of the Palatino products (Palatino, Aldus, Michelangelo, Sistina) as a complete, interrelated family, but subsequent conversions were never treated that way (i.e., Palatino Linotype is great, but there is no Aldus whose metrics match Palatino Linotype&rsquo;s exactly, nor a Sistina, Michelangelo, etc.). All of the faces within Palatino nova are interchangeable… that hasn&rsquo;t been easy to get in print since the days of handset type.</p>
<p>Palatino Sans &amp; Palatino Sans Informal will be just as mixable and interchangeable, but aren&rsquo;t part of the Palatino nova family in the simplest sense. Sorry to disappoint ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike,</p>
<p>More to your question: Since Palatino was designed for metal setting in the 40&rsquo;s, it was manufactured in several sizes. Larger cuts, intended for display sizes, would probably have had the features you remember. The digital version available for years was based on drawings for a smaller size, hence the apparent coarseness. Even the original metal type at small sizes differs greatly from the first digital version (I&rsquo;m looking at one of the first metal settings, Pen and Graver). I don&rsquo;t think Linotype is including any different size variants in the new release. I must disagree with Adam, I think some of the &lsquo;flair&rsquo; of Palatino&rsquo;s display cuts has been lost. Proportions, shapes, details, and color are all different, but some of this may be format conversion issues.</p>
<p>Dan, any idea if other sizes of Palatino (besides Michelangelo and Sistina) might be revived?</p>

<p>No, Carl, I don&rsquo;t think so. Michelangelo and Sistina were uniquely-designed members of the overarching Palatino family… they weren&rsquo;t optical revisions for display printing… some of the letters differ radically in ways that don&rsquo;t seem to bear a direct relation to size and legibility… they are meant to harmonize perfectly with Palatino text settings, but not be Palatino text (only larger).</p>
<p>But even taking this into account, I disgaree that Palatino nova doesn&rsquo;t cover size well. It doesn&rsquo;t have the dizzying array of variants found in Warnock, but it covers the bases that most designers will probably need. Aldus nova is particularly suited to book text (about 8–10 points). Palatino nova Regular is a great all-around Roman, which does quite well in 10–12 points. Palatino nova Medium can also be set small too, depending on printing conditions and needs. Palatino nova Light is good for display purposes, as is Palatino nova Titling (which should be used big), and Palatino nova Imperial, which can be used big as well, but works great in smaller display sizes where Titling might come out too light.</p>
<p>Hermann Zapf is certainly not a stranger to legibility techniques used in metal composition sizing… I&rsquo;m sure that he and Akira took optimal size performance into account in this version. The old &ldquo;flair&rdquo; of Palatino is certainly present in Palatino nova, it goes back to the original idea of Palatino, which was compromised in conversions to hot-metal and photo-typesetting machines.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The differences I remember, and see checking the luc site and comparing are the right-leaning A and the S and s that are unique&ndash;obviously influenced by black letter S. Also pointed out at the luc site are the lack of serif on p and q. also the jpq are shorter than the g. In the original digital version, and also the Optima Nova, the A and Ss are made more &lsquo;normal.&rsquo; serifs given to the pq and EF; and the g also seems somewhat redrawn. Altogether the original has more &lsquo;moxie&rsquo;, though the revised version may well work better in text. It is a pity that the new version doesn&rsquo;t at least have the original characters as alternates, for display purposes.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t know if the original Michaelangelo and Sistina had the right leaning A and the quasi black letter S, but I am curious.</p>
<p>How much was this Zapf? I ask because I can&rsquo;t believe that he wanted the condensed version of Optima that is part of Optima Nova. It really is disappointing, and I am surprised that he approved it.</p>
<p>I am interested to see the sans, especially because of my pet theory that the best sans and the best serifs never come from the same hand.  I&rsquo;d be very happy to be refuted. In any case, coming from Zapf&ndash;if it really is from him!&ndash;it is bound to be very interesting, however successful.</p>

Optima nova&rsquo;s Italics and Small Caps are quite radical departures, but that is while I like them, personally (it is also why I like Frutiger Next&rsquo;s Italic… but that wasn&rsquo;t really drawn by Frutiger the way that Zapf&rsquo;s new revisions are from Zapf… but that&rsquo;s another matter!).

<p>That being said, I agree with the comments that it does not seem to capture the &ldquo;moxie&rdquo; or flavorfulness of the original metal type, even the 10-12 point versions. There are a number of specific details that spring to mind, but the shape of the serif on the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo; is one of the things that bothers me the most, in comparison to the metal version.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, forgot to mention that. It&rsquo;s really wonderful that Zapf has been able to put one of the great typefaces designed in the 20th century into the digital form he wanted. I want it too!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sergej, a team of inhouse designers at Linotype several years ago developed Frutiger Next. Adrian Frutiger drew a few new characters for them (like the new ß, quite different from the ß in Frutiger), but the true italic glyphs (a,e,g, etc.) came from the other designers' hands/heads. As you must know, almost every typeface Adrian Frutiger has designed makes use of obliques instead of italics, so Frutiger Next is an interesting exercise in that regard. Frutiger Next also includes condensed styles, which had been asked for by designers for about a decade.</p>
<p>Hermann Zapf is much more hands-on and active. Even at 87, he comes into the office regularly to work with Akira on the whatever projects they happen to be working on at the moment. He seems to be in excellent health.</p>
