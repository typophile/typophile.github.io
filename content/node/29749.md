    like <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19833\" target=\"_blank\">Poesie Noire</a>
    though. Marcio's site seems to be down, but you can Google for it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Yep, that is some beautiful calligraphy done by hand. I would look for a lettering
    artist to do your logo. I think there is a local calligraphy organization in SF
    that can help you.
