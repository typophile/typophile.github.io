  body: "Retro isn\u2019t crazy and non-conformist, it\u2019s safe and unimaginative.\r\nThat
    applies to type design, poster design, and copywriting.\r\nThis kind of wordy
    inspirational poster is a fashionable trope.\r\nI have nothing against careful
    and precise typography, and retro can occasionally push the envelope, but in this
    case the message and the medium contradict one another."

  body: "Forbes magazine has an interesting article by Rob Siltanen. He was the creative
    director at TBWA/Chiat/Day and was deeply involved in the \"think different\"
    ad, and he was says that much of the folklore about the ad is wrong.\r\n\r\nSteve
    Jobs didn't come up with the concept. and in fact he initially rejected it. He
    told the agency \"\u201CThis is great \u2026 but I can\u2019t do this. People
    already think I\u2019m an egotist, and putting the Apple logo up there with all
    these geniuses will get me skewered by the press.\u201D \r\n\r\nHowever Steve
    changed his mind about the ad and become involved in the fine-tuning of the concept.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/12/14/the-real-story-behind-apples-think-different-campaign/\r\n\r\nAnd
    Ken Segal has a short article about the voiceover in the commercial. The agency
    auditioned a number of actors and Richard Dryfuss was eventually chosen, but believe
    it or not Steve Jobs asked them to audition comedian Phyllis Diller. She seemed
    an unlikely choice, but Steve knew her because she'd done voiceover work for Pixar.

  body: Well, yes, the Forbes link James posted actually tells the whole story. Sounds
    like Rob Siltanen is probably the best source of the quote, with involvement of
    Jobs and others. I guess I was trying to say, "Don't just tell us so-and-so isn't
    the source; tell us the real source!"
