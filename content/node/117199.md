body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ikaho2SM_5077.jpg]\r\nI found a Japanese
  font called Ikaho2 that includes these big top Latin letters and numbers. \r\nI
  don't know whether they are an original design or based on an existing font. I looked
  at Big Top Acrobat, Comedy, Dreamland, Showcard Gothic, Laff Riot NF,   Startling
  and a couple of other Fun Fonts, but they are different. Any ideas?\r\nDon"

    But you do have a clearer pic of the letters, which I appreciate.\r\nDon"

    it seems the font is included only in a book, <em>Design Font Mania</em>. You
    need to buy the book to use the font and can\u2019t download it anywhere.\r\nhttp://mksd.jp/ikaho2.html"

    alphabet in the original design category and credit Masayuki Sata and Mami Kobatyashi.
    Now for my probably presumptuous comment of the day: This font seems completely
    unknown outside Japan and will continue to be so as long as its sales are limited
    to purchasers of a book where most of the fonts are for Japanese use. If the designers
    want to make some sales to rest of the world they should consider releasing a
    the Latin letters version of IkahoAL as a stand alone font sold through one or
    more of the big resellers. In my opinion the design is very competitive with the
    other big top fun fonts mentioned in my ID request and could be a solid seller.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don - Years ago I used to monitor many websites for new releases of free
    fonts - including several favororite Japanese websites like Maniackers and <a
    href='http://www.iai-jp.com/' target='_blank'>iAi</a> (check out Kivart's font
    Punition - as well as the wallpapers and artwork).\r\n\r\nOccasionally, on a site
    like Maniackers, I'd come across a font that I really liked but that was <em>not</em>
    free. Despite my willingness to pay and try as I might, I could never find any
    way to pay Western money for these fonts.\r\n\r\nA decade later nothing seems
    to have changed. In this day and age that seems crazy. Do you know why this is,
    Akira? Why does Japan seem to be isolated from international sales of fonts?"

    more extreme than the problems with the Solo fonts bundled with the Dover alphabet
    books. \r\nBTW many thanks for the Punition  link. Unique design, Germanic blackletter
    as if it were reinterpreted by an Arabic calligrapher!\r\nDon"

  body: "The reason might be that a lot of Japanese don\u2019t speak English well.
    But, I\u2019m not sure.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don\u2019t recommend Latin fonts Japanese
    designers designed. Most of them are low-quality.\r\nAkira Kobayashi who is a
    Monotype Type Director, Kunihiko Okano who graduated from KABK, and Toshi Omagari
    who graduated from Reading and works for Monotype UK are, of course, brilliant
    exceptions. They are great designers.\r\nAnd some of the younger designers create
    high-quality Latin typefaces. (Two Japanese are studying at Reading MA Typeface
    Design now.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say Morisawa and Fontworks, two largest type foundries
    in Japan, don\u2019t sell their fonts to overseas people. I don\u2019t know why.\r\nSeveral
    Japanese foundries, e.g. Jiyu Kobo, Iwata, TypeProject and Motoya, sell thier
    fonts at Fonts.com."
