  body: "They look custom to me: Look at the different middle bar length of \"E\"
    vs \"EE\" or \"F\" vs \"FF\".\r\nThat said, I think the <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Lastwaerk%20black%20-%20Regular&fid=8c33214e72492c66d8c8b9f2ea43dbd5&fsize=60&text=CDEFS&fit=1|Lastwaerk

  body: Thanks for your keen observations and suggestions.  I hadn't looked at either

    and Mandatory and maybe, Gratis.
