  any input from the pro\u2019s. \r\nIt\u2019s got more or less two weights right
  now, and you can test it in this typetester here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.doubletwo.net/MiloTest/Index.html]]\r\n\r\nI
  would be very pleased if you got some feedback for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nlec\r\n\r\nAnd
  please ignore the name \"Milo\", I know there is a typeface out there with that
  name. This was the first came into my mind so it\u2019s a kind of workingtitle."

  body: It's good. The Black b,d,p,q seem condensed and would be more in character
    if you let the bowl out some.

  body: It feels a bit wide to me because it seems as if it was stretched horizontally.
    But otherwise looks very nice.

  body: "Yes right, the Black b,d,p,q can take a little, did not see that. It is a
    very rough first cut, I just followed what came up... I'm trying to fix this.
    \r\n\r\nAnd yes litera, you are right, it seems a little too wide. Maybe I try
    to narrow some characters to get closer to the b,d,p,q. Or does the Thin seem
    wide to you too?\r\n\r\nI am planning some condensed and maybe ultra-condensed
    weights too. I want to try out the whole range of multiple master functionality.
    \r\n\r\nAnd i am not sure with the dot above the i and j and rounded punctuation.
    Maybe squarish would be better for that?"

  body: "Good-looking stuff generally. I would definitely have a look again at the
    /g/ in the black version - considering your carefully-crafted colour correction
    (maybe on the verge of being too thinned) on the /N/, that ear is way too heavy,
    and the link feels a bit weak. \r\n\r\nI'd also have another look at the various
    white sections, again problematic in /g/ but also feeling a bit weird in many
    other bowled letters in the black. In the /e/, for instance, it looks optically
    futher left than the tail. In the /b/ and /d/ it feels diagonally leaned.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing you seriously need to go through, in both weights, is the baseline appearance
    - some letters (notably thin /t/) have too much overhang, while others, like thin
    /O/, have too little."

  body: "Thanks, all good points.\r\nYes, i corrected the /N/ because it was way too
    heavy, maybe little too strong. :)\r\nAnd you are right with the bowls... i'll
    check that.\r\n\r\nIn deed I did not looked closer at the baseline, very good
    tip.\r\n"

  body: Yes both weights. /o/ in either weight seems to have perfect width. Most of
    the others are just too wide.

  body: "lecter what is the technology behind the site, if you don't mind me asking?\r\nAnd
    are you making changes to the active/linked font file?\r\n\r\nI've not seen anyone
    put their fonts up for critique in this way :-)\r\n\r\nMy modest input: The counters
    in the black version seem very small. Letters such as the /c/ are quite different
    between weights, the light is much rounder. Some characters are necessarily different
    (/f/) but I think the /c/ could share some more DNA with it's light counterpart.
    Feel free to disagree."

    it's just an image of few letters. :)\r\n\r\n@lecter: Very nice app. I'm interested
    in knowing as well.\r\n\r\nBTW: Black seems a bit like a faux black with invalid
    shape contrast. I don't like it too much."

  body: "oh, i thought the layout would explain the functionality for itself. \r\ni'm
    a little into flash-actionscripting, so i thought it would be cool to create a
    simple display tool for showing my fonts. it would be cooler if i only had to
    put the fonts into a seperate folder or somthing but i have to embed them. but
    then its really nice i think. but there is a little bug its kind of limited to
    a maximum fontsize. i dont know what that comes from. gotta check that. (maybe
    ;))\r\n\r\nbtw: i have uploaded a newer version, have a look at that maybe its
    a bit better.\r\n-> http://www.doubletwo.net/MiloTest2/Index.html"

    of your home, go nuts. But you shouldn't be putting a font out in public with
    the same name as a published font. Even if it's just a working title. Even if
    your font is still in development. Leaving aside the legal & trademark issues\_\u2014
    this is basic good sportsmanship."

    i found on my (maybe too quick) research was this here and i thought its forms

    can i change the threattitle somewhere?"

    in the bold  looks clumsy compared with the nicely worked inktraps in W and V\r\nand
    the black does look to have counters that will close up in small sizes.\r\nMaybe
    interpolate and make it a bit lighter.  \r\n"
