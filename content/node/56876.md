  were going through my mothers old books and this is one of the things I found. It

    are interesting, especially mu and rho. \r\nAny more samples of italic?\r\n"

  body: "There were very little italics. That is why I posted that page. You can see
    the line at the top is letterspaced in the more typical way of that era.  There
    was a tiny bit of bold as well. I will keep looking through it but the book is
    in pretty bad shape and is crumbling :-(\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Yes! The newer book was an anthology with both religious and historic material.
    The older book was published shortly after the Greeks had finally reclamed their
    independence from the Ottomans. My Greek is pretty lousy so I am not that good
    of a translator.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
