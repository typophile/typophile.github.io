body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>can anyone help me with a text document with a fake text that
  contains all the possible combinations of characters that need to be checked creating
  a typeface? I&#39;m thinking about the ligatures, the kerning- and other spacingproblems,
  etc. And all of this for the European language. Cyrillic and Chinese is out of my
  reach &#40;for now&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren
