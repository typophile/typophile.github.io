		<div class="commentbody">1) A face that doesn't have enough room for smallcaps between the x-height and the fullcap-height isn't a text font, so naturally Regularity becomes/can_become more important - you can freely sacrifice readability. <BR>2) There's virtually zero harm in confusing smallcaps with fullcaps (I mean in their usual usage of acronyms in running text, as opposed to fancy titling), while there is in confusing them with lc. <BR> <BR>So you could conclude that a font with a huge x-height doesn't need smallcaps that much. <BR> <BR>And I personally would go further: a good text face has very short caps (much shorter than current -or past- convention) - it doesn't need smallcaps, at least not that much - there are [generally] more important things to worry about. Not least because virtually nobody uses smallcaps, even if the font has it right under their noses&hellip; <BR> <BR>&gt; +0.2pt <BR> <BR>I don't know how much larger they need to be - it simply has to be a visible difference, in fact some distance into the parafovea. BTW, it's interesting that the smaller the point size the larger the absolute difference necessary. The problem here is that at very smaller point sizes the x-height needs to be larger too - I guess one could conclude that smallcaps have little place in tiny typography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good catch. I was sloppy. <BR> <BR>The first part assumes conventional proportions - caps slightly smaller than ascenders. Which is why when x-height/cap-height is too large, so is x-height/ascenders (a key factor in readability). In fact my proposal (making caps notably smaller than ascenders) goes hand-in-hand with reducing the necessity of smallcaps. Is that clearer? <BR> <BR>BTW, I think necessity is simply relative. An ideal face will have smallcaps (even if the x-height is large), but to me it's much more important to have sized masters, for example - which very few people do. Too many people are making smallcaps (not to mention the dreaded Unicase) instead of spending the time on more important things. And it seems to be a peer-pressure situation. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
