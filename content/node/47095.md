    it?</em>\r\n\r\nI wonder the same thing about half the \"new\" font releases currently
    on offer. So many \"foundries\" are fake, turning out fake font products, old
    dead thing knock-offs and plagiarised works. They get away with charging for it
    and licensing it with sheer gall, by telling lies and denying any impropriety.\r\n\r\nThey
    even call themselves \"foundries\".\r\n\r\nMany other design and manufacturing
    industries re-invent the wheel on a daily basis, but at least they have the veracity
    to admit it. Only the type industry is sufficiently self-deluded to pretend otherwise.
    The French and Americans are especially adept at doing this. Meanwhile almost
    nothing of merit in the way of type design has come out of Australia unless you
    count one or two of my own efforts. A few operators from South America have managed
    to tarnish that continent's otherwize excellent reputation for original faces
    with guts.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
