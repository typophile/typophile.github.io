  body: 21.006 Is a nice concept. That thang is bigger&#39;n Texas though! Also, I&#39;d
    reverse front and back. <BR> <BR>21.008 Hmmm... I smell ironicism. <BR> <BR> -

  body: '21.011 is a nice little idea. Simple but effective. <BR>21.006 could have
    been a bit more restrained: I think  <BR>for example the original Univers grid
    is graphically  <BR>more interesting than this full uninterrupted square.'

  body: -about 006 &#40;whose concept is great&#41; I think  <BR>faces a very important
    problem which has been  <BR>mentioned from the begining of the contest... <BR>those
    designs will be weared by people.  <BR> <BR>So, even that i admire the idea i
    think  <BR>if i&#39;d wear it i would look like a Roman  <BR>soldier in his suit
    of armour.  <BR> <BR>As for 011 which is also a nice concept  <BR>&#40;less strong
    than 006&#41; i think the execution  <BR>is less intersting than this idea would
    deserve. <BR> <BR>christos
