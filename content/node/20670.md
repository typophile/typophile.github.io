body: "Heya typophile,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a playful but legible face to use for
  headlines (and possibly something from the same family for body text) for a 6pp
  brocure for an Australian publisher promoting a series of science text books for
  high school students.\r\n\r\nSo far i've come up with these:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11671.0.10&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SCIENCE+for+vels&sampleSize=48\">FF
  Profile Black Italic</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11680.0.24&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SCIENCE+for+vels&sampleSize=48\">FF
  Sanuk Black Italic</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11670.0.21&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SCIENCE+for+vels&sampleSize=48\">FF
  Milo Black Italic</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11491.6.28&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SCIENCE+for+vels&sampleSize=48\">FF
  Daxline Extra Bold</a>\r\n\r\nOf these, i think FF Profile has the most personality,
  and would probably work fairly well.  Maybe something a bit wackier?\r\n\r\nThanks.
  JonnySchneider\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have to admit, none of the possibilities you are considering strike me
    as playful. Maybe the publication is too serious for these, but consider Absara
    Sans, Megano Sans, or Vista Sans, also by Xavier Dupre. Even his Jambono, while
    informal, has a bunch of weights to choose from.\r\n\r\nThis brings up a topic:
    How the hell does Xavier release 4 different sans families in the span of 2 years?
    And they are all good. I'm scared of him. "

    have been finsihed for several years but happened to be released at once. But
    still.\r\n\r\nMore playful: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=MVB.118646.0.0\">MVB

  body: "Thanks all for your suggestions.\r\n\r\nCrossgrove: spot on!  Megano will
    be just right for this job i think.  \r\n\r\nI'm familiar with Vista, but have
    always considered it a little bit feline for my tastes.  \r\n\r\nJambono is also
    really nice and would probably work (its a fairly informal brocure) but i'm never
    that comfortable using such informal faces.  I always think they look a little
    bit out of place with a sans body faces like Gill-sans.  I've never been able
    to figure out a good complimentary face, probably an indication of my lack of
    experience...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think i'll work with Megano.  Thanks again!\r\n\r\nJonnySchneider
