  body: From LinoType. <BR> <BR>About DIN 1451 Font Family <BR> <BR> <BR>DIN stands
    for Deutsche Industrienorm, German Industrial Standard. In 1936 the German Standard
    Committee settled upon DIN 1451 as the standard font for the areas of technology,
    traffic, administration and business. The Committee chose a sans serif font because
    of its legibility and because its forms are also easy to write. This font was
    not foreseen for advertisements and other &#39;artistically oriented uses&#39;
    and there were disagreements about its aesthetic qualities. Nevertheless, DIN
    font was seen everywhere in Germany, on signs for towns and traffic, and hence
    made its way into advertisements because of its ease of recognition.

    when Albert was here student in the 80th, under the management of one additional
    legend of Gerrit Of nordiya &#40;Gerrit Noordzij&#41; of department Type&amp;.Media
    yet there did not exist, but academy already became slowly incubator for the type
    designers. The group of talented young shriftovikov organized then the creative
    group Letters, into composition of which entered the future celebrities: Frank
    Blokland &#40;Dutch Type Library&#41;, Petr Van Blokland, Jelle Bosma, Lucas de
    Groot, Bart de Haas, Henk Van Leyden, Peter-Matthias Noordzij &#40;The Enschede
    Font Foundry&#41;, Marie-Cecile Noordzij-Pulles, Just Van Rossum and Peter Verheul.
    Children were gathered, by their &#34;powerful heap&#34;, discussed types, they
    shared experience - that still it is possible to make in the student companies...
    <BR> <BR> <BR>1986 <BR> <BR>But our hero after studies leaves for Germany, for
    Hamburg, where he begins to work first in company Scangraphic, <BR>and then also
    in URW&#43;&#43;. For the latter it develops types URW Imperial, URW Linear, URW
    Mauritius. <BR>Then Albert- Jan organizes in Hamburg his own design the studio,

    Albert- Jan floor obtains proposal from corporation FontFont &#40;using the case,
    I congratulate it with the fifteen-year period!&#41; on the development of new
    type on basis the set of first half of the century &#40;of past&#41; German commercial
    standard Deutsche Industrie Norm - DIN. <BR>Albert- Jan with happiness agrees,
    after solving that work is not so complex, as it is interesting. However, after
    studying serious studies it reveals more than thousand different it is type developed
    by DIN- institute during the period from the beginning on the middle of century...
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>including the
    early... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>including by the way, and the cyrillic alphabet,
    developed in 1943... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>besides, into these standards entered
    not only types, but also logotypes... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>But
    also reveals a large quantity of inscriptions, which were preserved on the old
    buildings, those sometimes written multilayer, by different types, and on the
    tables... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>even children&#39;s stencils
    for study and drawing of letters were described once in DIN... <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>After processing all this sea of type information, Albert- Jan floor produces
    to light FF DIN - perfect German type, created, first of all, on base DIN-Mittelschrift
    of 1451: <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Now this type
    became the integral part of Germany and is used for guide sign... <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#40;here, by the way, last development in the region of &#34;road&#34; it
    is type from James montal&#39;ban by the name ClearView&#41; <BR> <BR>for the
    advertisement and the periodicals... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thus,
    Albert- Jan was one of the first researchers, who turned upside-down the storages
    of the old DINovskix it was type. And theme proved to be such interesting that
    many type offices already solved &#40;but how much still they will solve!&#41;

  body: Most educational, thank you david for the translation. It&#39;s also a great
    story, I look forward to more of this kind of thing. <BR> <BR>If I may, I have
    some questions about the design of DIN, Mr. Pool, if you would be so kind. Can
    we assume that the decisions made in the design, very unique things like the comma
    and the at symbol, come from your research? Are the alternate characters, such
    as the circular period and single story &#39;a&#39; also from varieties of the
    original?  Or are these things that you brought to the face to make it more versatile?  <BR>
    <BR>Just curious, thought I&#39;d take the chance to ask, thanks for your time,
    <BR>Aaron
