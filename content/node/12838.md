body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI would like to know a name for this font, I have no pictures of
  it though.\r\n\r\nIt is basically looking like American Typewriter, but has really
  big, round serifs (like serif \"balls\"). Overall, it's a very american, very 70s
  sort of font. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in anticipation!!\r\n\r\nHerb"

    Clarendon</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Clarendon lowercase \"y\" that's the
    serif balls I am talking about, but they need to be A LOT bigger, like really
    exaggerated ly big.\r\n\r\n"

    of their display faces.
