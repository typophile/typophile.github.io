  My scanner has packed up so I can't even post a visual. So here's the challenge:
  - I will try and describe the font and see if anyone can hopefully help.\r\n\r\n1.
  It is a sans serif font\r\n2. The main characters that stand out are the V and the
  M. On the V, the left hand stroke is vertical, whilst the right hand slopes. On
  the M, the Left hand upright slopes, the second is vertical, the third slopes and
  the right hand is vertical.\r\n3. The O is a circle\r\n4. The centre of the M is
  on the baseline\r\n5. The P and R are closed\r\n\r\nSorry to be so vague, but if
  anyone can help I would appreciate it."

    the font?

  body: Ok just looked at the avant garde Alternative, it is very similar, but the
    R's are closed, are there other alternative fonts?

  body: "I\u2019ve seen a few different custom variations over the Avant Garde Alternates
    applied to other typefaces. A Norwegian magazine called Carl*s Cars used to set
    their headings in a DIN like face that worked quite well. (Check their website
    www.carls-cars.com for examples). I don\u2019t remember the other examples. My
    point is though: these emulations of AG\u2019s style are rather easily done by
    amateurs (and often look crap)."
