  body: I think that is Castor by Albert Auspurg, 1924 for Haas. I'm not aware of
    any digital versions. I'm looking for an image to show.

  body: "This inline/openface style is sometimes called \"handtooled\" or \"highlight.\"\r\nIn
    addition to Dominus, suggested by Riccardo, here are a few more fonts similar
    to Albert Auspurg's Castor: \r\nGoudy Handtooled http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Goudy+Handtooled&q=Go\r\nITC
    Garamond Handtooled http://www.identifont.com/find?font=ITC+Garamond+Handtooled&q=Go\r\nITC
    Century Handtooled http://www.identifont.com/find?font=ITC+Century+Handtooled&q=Go\r\nITC
    Cheltenham Handtooled http://www.identifont.com/find?font=ITC+Cheltenham+Handtooled&q=Go\r\nRichler
    Highlight http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Richler+Highlight&q=Go\r\nImprint
    Shadow http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Imprint+Shadow&q=Go\r\nNarcissus http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Narcissus&q=Go\r\nThere
    is also Spotlight http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Spotlight&q=Go This is a
    heavier font, but is similar to Castor in that it has large angled serifs on _E_,
    _F_, _S_ etc.\r\nFinally another font by the designer of Castor, Albert Auspurg,
    which like Castor has large angled serifs on _E_, _F_, _S_ etc. and some overhanging
    diagonal strokes,  but a double inline instead of a highlight. This is his Kolibri
    of 1915, digitized by Nick Curtis as Trochilida NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/trochilida-nf/
    Could be modified by deleting one of the two inline panels and compressing the
    width to produce a result quite similar to Castor.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you, Michel, for the Auspurg PDF.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Solotype
    Catalog shows a Kolibree 2 which was, like Castor, a highlight style typeface
    and Kolibree 3 which was totally filled in. Those may have been photolettering
    constructs."

  body: "Thanks for the help! What an impressive wealth of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe feature
    I particularly liked in Castor was the shape of the Capital S. Although it is
    quite a bit broader than Castor, I think Spotlight is a pretty good substitute.\r\n\r\nCheers
