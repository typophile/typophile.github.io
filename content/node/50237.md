body: "I am continuing my Ambigram project. I want fresh eyes to overlook it. \r\n\r\nHow
  to look at it:\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know about ambigrams. An ambigrams can
  be a word read one way and be rotated 180 degrees to be read as the same word or
  a different word. Therefore,\r\n\r\nRead this word (or type out the letters you
  see in order you see them) then look at the 180 degree rotation of the word and
  read it (or type out the letters seen in order seen)\r\n\r\nIt is a fun little puzzle
  if you will for those who take the time to look at it. So have fun and give good
  feed back if you want. It would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nHint: it is a first and last
  name\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambipic_3445.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambipic2_3719.jpg]"

  body: "reads to me as:\r\n\r\nRynn Guss\r\n\r\nknowing that it's your 1st and last
    name, the 'T' in Tauss is too ambiguous to be recognized as a part of it. the
    'a' in Ryan looks just like an 'n'"

  body: "You might want to try a two-story a, open on the right side, for the a in
    Tauss. I think that could be made into a curvy cap N or lowercase n with a tail.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambigram_3427.jpg]"
