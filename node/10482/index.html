  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I hope this is fitting for this forum. It&#39;s more logo-related than logo-type-related, but seeing the great critiques here compelled me to post. Plus, I&#39;m the only graphic designer in the building, so it helps to get other&#39;s input. <BR> <BR>This is a logo for our branch of government here in MN. I&#39;ve come up with 3 variations that I &#40;and a few others&#41; seem to think are the strongest. I now need your harsh, honest critiques! <BR> <BR>There&#39;s one disclaimer, and one I&#39;ll probably take some heat for saying...but I an limited to only free fonts and whatevers on my machine &#40;gasp!&#41;. As our state is in the hole a few billion, getting darrel a few licensed fonts isn&#39;t really on the priority list. <BR> <BR>So, here they are. <BR> <BR>Logo one &#40;uses Tanek, from CSA&#41; represents the state &#40;duh&#41; and the 10 court districts rendered in a stained-glass-like way. This also hints at the stained glass ceiling installation in the supreme court. PROS: nice double-meaning, simple CONS: not as nice in one-color. <BR> <BR>Logo two &#40;uses Futura, from Apple, and Covington, from apostrophiclab&#41; is the more &#39;elegant&#39; of the bunch &#40;if not just a bit hokey&#41;. It&#39;s the state bird perched upon a roman column. &#40;bird = MN, column = courhouse&#41; PROS: most &#39;regal&#39; of the bunch CONS: is it hokey? &#40;Most have said &#39;no&#39; but I still wonder...&#41; <BR> <BR>Logo three &#40;uses Futura, from Apple&#41; is a simple rendering of common iconography...the state and the scales of justice. PROS: recognizable iconography CONS: cliche? Too trendy? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7047.gif" alt="Logos &#40;GIF&#41;"> <BR> <BR>now, let me have it!</div>

The pillar is a better &#40;less obvious&#41; way to say  <BR>&#39;law&#39; than the scales of justice. That said, the pillar is still  <BR>obvious. Is there a classy way to render the loon, so it&#39;s  <BR>not so cartoony? <BR> <BR>#3 is way too trendy. The color, the illustration stlye,  <BR>even the subject matter is ultra-obvious &#40;which is why  <BR>you&#39;ve rendered it this way, I&#39;m guessing&#41;.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey guys...thanks for all of the critiques! This is helping. <BR> <BR>To respond to some of the comments... <BR> <BR>&#62; you have some kerning to do <BR> <BR>Yea, I really need to work on all of the type on these...I just set them as-is for now. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;d be concerned in the third option about <BR>&#62; misinterpretation: &#39;In Minnesota, the road  <BR>&#62; to justice is a crooked one&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Do you think people would read that much into it? It&#39;s an interesting observation. <BR> <BR>&#62; The loon is just looney. <BR>and <BR>&#62; is the only one that seems appropriate  <BR>&#62; for a judicial branch.  <BR> <BR>&#42;sigh&#42;...that&#39;s been my dilema. I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll let the client decide on this one ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; 1 has a good concept, but the  <BR>&#62; execution is too... Well, too CSA <BR> <BR>Ha! There&#39;s a reason for that. I had a buddy over at CSA critique it and suggest a lot of what you see there...not to mention that &#40;coincidently&#41; the face I was using was from CSA as well. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>I have some other variations of that that I&#39;ll work on...the fine-etched engraving idea is a good one. <BR> <BR>&#62; Is there a classy way to render the loon,  <BR>&#62; so it&#39;s not so cartoony? <BR> <BR>Do you think it&#39;s the illustration style, or the fact that it&#39;s just a loon? I&#39;ll work on that some more. <BR> <BR>&#62; #3 is way too trendy...even though, we could all guess that the client asked for it. <BR> <BR>It kind of goes without saying that one of the options needs to be a state/scales of justice. Yea, it&#39;s incredibly cliche, so I tried to at least have fun with it. I do have several other style variations that I&#39;ll post when I get the chance for comparison. <BR> <BR>&#62; I think the logo has to say strength and durability. <BR> <BR>Could you say a bit more about that Brennan? I assume you were referring to the column logo. Were you referring to the style? Line weight? <BR> <BR>Again, thanks everyone. I&#39;ll try and post some more this afternoon &#40;if not new stuff, some of the sketches up to this point...&#41; <BR> <BR>-Darrel <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Well, the way I see it is that the Judicial system  <BR>&#62; is about strength against criminality. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s just one part of it. Criminal court is just a segment of the court system. There&#39;s juveniles, divorces, bankruptcies, child support, etc. So it&#39;s more about &#39;fairness for all&#39; than the courts being &#39;against&#39; anything in particular. <BR> <BR>That doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be a &#39;strong&#39; mark, though. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;But if it works with the attitude of  <BR>&#62;Minnesota and the state&#39;s other identity <BR>&#62;schemes, go for it. <BR> <BR>Well, in some ways I am fortunate in that I&#39;m starting from scratch. There really aren&#39;t any departments with an identity &#40;except for maybe the tourism board&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Well, I was hoping to have new stuff to post, but the project has been side tracked this week. I did promise something, so here are some of the logo variations prior to the ones above... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7179.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>No need to comment on them &#40;unless you want to&#41;.

I did try and simplify it a bit so it wasn&#39;t quite as trendy and hopefully the lock-up in a color block will be used consistently. We&#39;ll see. ;o&#41; I still need to tweak the kerning and such. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all of the advice everyone! <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
