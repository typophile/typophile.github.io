body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need some advice about setting fractions in InDesign and Illustrator.
  This research is taking me in a couple directions.\r\n\r\nOur packaging team needs
  to be able to easily create fractions in Illustrator. Their goal is to have the
  fractions easily accessible for themselves and their vendors in the type styles
  they've chosen for packaging projects. Because our packaging is created by our vendors
  and not our internal teams, we are dealing with various unkown skill levels for
  the creative process!\r\n\r\n1. I tried to find plug-ins or scripts that can be
  used in Illustrator to create fractions. We could purchase this product and encourage
  our vendors to purchase it as well so we have consistency in usage and creation
  of fractions. I have not found anything for this as yet. We are still stuck in Illustrator
  CS2 because the corporation moves at a glacial pace when updating, so that may be
  part of the problem.\r\n\r\n2. I did find a plug in for InDesign that looks quite
  good from http://www.danrodney.com/. I e-mailed Dan and learned that his plug in
  does not work in Illustrator and that he does not have the time nor the skills to
  script an equivalent product in Illustrator. So one option is to hire someone who
  can script a similar package in Illustrator. Any leads would be appreciated. We
  are likely to purchase this product for our InDesign users.\r\n\r\n3. I know that
  OpenType fonts CAN have fractions included in their glyphs, but I'm finding very
  few fonts that have fractions included, even in the OpenType format. I'm wondering
  if there are standards in the industry in regards to when to make fractions a part
  of the OpenType fonts and what we users can do to encourage that fractions be included.\r\n\r\n4.
  It has been suggested that I contact font manufacturers and ask for custom-made
  fraction fonts or fractions glyphs to be included in typefaces that we currently
  license. This seems bulky and expensive, but is also a possibility.\r\n\r\nSo ...
  if my goal is to be able to create beautiful fractions consistently in Illustrator,
  what kind of solutions do you suggest?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n\r\n"

    included in their glyphs</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, that\u2019s the easiest way; the way
    it should be: type the \u2018plain\u2019 fraction, select figures and separator
    and choose the OpenType option \u2018Fractions\u2019. That, of course, is only
    possible if the font features numerator and denominator forms for all figures.\r\n\r\n<cite>We
    are still stuck in Illustrator CS2 [\u2026] so that may be part of the problem.</cite>\r\n\r\nNo,
    this is available in Illustrator (and InDesign) CS2, too.\r\n\r\n<cite>but I\u2019m
    finding very few fonts that have fractions included </cite>\r\n\r\nYou can check:
    <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/\">Adobe</a> has icons that indicate if a
    certain OpenType feature (like fractions) is available in the font in question:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adobe_5198.png]\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/\">FontShop</a> offers a customizable view
    of the character set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fs_6128.png]\r\n\r\nOther
    foundries/distributors have different approaches; but most of them mention the
    (un)availability of OpenType features in some way on their website. All will be
    happy to let you know if you ask them.\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m wondering if there
    are standards in the industry in regards to when to make fractions a part of the
    OpenType fonts and what we users can do to encourage that fractions be included.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot
    really. Check out FontFont\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/download.php?docid=0\">OpenType
    User Guide</a> [PDF, page 8]:\r\n<cite>The number of fractions in a font may vary.
    OpenType Standard FontFonts include at least fractions for \xBC, \xBD and \xBE.</cite>\r\nF"

    fifths, eighths, and thirds.\r\n\r\nMy present practice is to include these as
    pre-composed characters in all my fonts, and I suspect that other foundries are
    doing the same with their OpenType faces. It's a step beyond the basic three of
    the original digital font formats.\r\n\r\nSo look for the latest OpenType fonts,
    check out their pdf samples, and I think you will find enough pre-composed fractions.\r\n\r\nBut
    do you need sixths or sixteenths? Hardly any fonts have those as pre-composed,
    but if an OpenType font has the \"Fraction\" feature, it will be able to make
    those properly, and all you have to do is type \"number slash number\" and apply
    the \r\n\"Fraction\" feature in the OpenType palette, as Florian explained.\r\n\r\nDo
    you like nuts, Kristin?"

    and [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/|TEFF Renard]] will convert any sequence
    of xx/xx into a fraction when the Fraction feature is applied. Florian's examples
    above can be made effortlessly. :)

  body: "There are plenty of font sets that include expert collections which let you
    compose your own fractions, such as the FF Meta family or the Thesis fonts. These
    fonts contain complete sets of numerators and denominators, as Florian mentioned.
    I think it may be easier to switch fonts than to ask your vendors to customize
    their fonts for you. \r\n\r\nThere is no industry standard, unfortunately. I come
    across this problem a lot.\r\n\r\nAlternately, in InDesign, you can create character
    style sheets for numerators (I usually make them 3 points smaller than the regular
    size shift them up 2 1/2 or 3 points. Sometimes I go up a weight if the family
    has enough subtlety) and denominators (also 3 points smaller but no baseline shift).
    Just remember to use the opt+shift+1 character for the slash."

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. We currently license very few OpenType fonts
    and the ones I've tried do not have full number sets for denominators and numerators.
    Darn it.\r\n\r\nLots of these suggestions make sense, including choosing a different
    font. However, I work in a huge corporation. Things don't work that way. \r\n\r\nFirst,
    the fonts have been decided by some committee I haven't been invited to and can.not.change.
    \r\n\r\nSecond, the production work is not done in-house, but by vendors around
    the world. \r\n\r\nThird, fractions are used very frequently.\r\n\r\nFourth, we
    are limited to the Illustrator application.\r\n\r\nGiven these conditions, we're
    working to improve the quality of the work we purchase. We have had some general
    success in reaching this goal by doing the following:\r\n\r\nWe produce extensive
    style guides\r\nWe provide color specifications\r\nWe provide templates\r\nWe
    demand our vendors license the same fonts we license.\r\nWe provide clean, print-ready
    digital art files for patterns, logos, illustrations, etc.\r\nWe provide direction
    for copy tone, photography and illustration styles.\r\nWe provide sample documents.\r\n\r\nSo
    now we are trying to find a solution for the extreme lack of quality in the fractions
    that appear in these documents. \r\n\r\nThis is beginning to sound like a challenge
    for \"Project Runway\". Welcome to my job!\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n\r\n"

    to having their sacred approved type modified (even though it would be cheaper
    yet to just buy fonts that already have the {frac} feature)?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    find which foundries permit you, or a third party, to add the necessary glyphs
    and feature coding.\r\n\r\nHowever, that will severely restrict your choice of
    fonts, as it is really only in the past three years that Mac-based type designers
    have been making OpenType fonts, and the Fraction feature is not a standard, so
    you really have no way of knowing whether any particular typeface has the feature
    unless you check.\r\n\r\nMyFonts.com and FontShop.com are probably the best places
    to examine which OpenType features fonts have. "

    to add specific characters when we need them. Most recently we worked with FontShop
    to get some special characters from Type-O-Tones for the Club Wedd campaign. I
    do get a nice glow when I know I can send some extra corporate money to folks
    who make fonts!\r\n\r\nBut somehow I thought that would be asking too much: not
    in terms of cost, but in terms of time spent tracking down the right people at
    the foundry, getting the various versions of fractions we need, etc. OTOH, if
    our demands could help get foundries to create OpenType fonts with the faction
    function that's been mentioned here, that would be awesome and would definitely
    solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping me think this through everyone! I'll
