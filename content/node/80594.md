  find on the internet and I cannot identify this font.  Some tools will identify
  fonts where maybe one letter may come very close to matching but the other letters
  are way off.\r\n\r\nI'd greatly appreciate the guidance of the Typophile masses.\r\n\r\nI
  got the font in a vector for so I've uploaded the text portion of the logo as is
  and also a version where each letter is spaced out.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ct-logo_6361.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ct-logo-split_5516.png]"
