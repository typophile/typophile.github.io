<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, I've been designing a logo for sort a union of culture & research... I really don't know how to explain it, as it's fuzzy already in Swedish. <br> <br>Oh well, I went the swash way (don't kill me, they're supposed to symbolize the northern lights), and now I'm stuck with the type... <br>It's Gill sans bold for the "Nordkalottens" part and Adobe caslon semibold for the "Kultur & Forskningscentrum". I don't like the type... please help me <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1240.gif alt=logo> <br> <br>Thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody> Hej Richard, <br> <br>for being a logo for that kind of institution, I think it's perfect. <br>It's seldom Gill feels original these days, but here it does. <br> <br>"Kultur & forskningscentrum" should maybe be a in little smaller point size. And not so close to the logo symbol. <br> <br>Skitfin! <br> <br>/peter </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hej, you crazy svenskas. <br> <br>I like it too, Richard. Very comforting. <br>Maybe try all the text aligned left or <br>almost aligned left with "Nordkalottens" <br>a bit to the right so the symbol fits in <br>nice and snug. <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> Yeah, I had it aligned left before, but it looked sort of weird when there was a huge gap between the symbol and the lower text. I'll try to move it a bit though. (resizing it might do the trick as well though). <br> <br>Thanks for the comment. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> </div>

<div class=commentbody> I think it's pretty nice - the type seems to work well, especially if it's a "sober" operation. BTW, swooshes aren't so bad for non-internet stuff! <br> <br>But I see two potentially serious problems: <br>1. It's really wide - so it's less versatile. <br>2. With the green, those look like leaves, and not at all atmospheric effects. So it immediately makes me think of an environmantal conservation organization or something. I know blue is cold, but... <br> <br>There's also this: Because your logo relies on tight spaces (in this case the gap between the "leaves"), you should make a different version for smaller sizes. <br> <br>BTW, if they're serious about the aurora stuff, you might consider making a wide, shimmering, irregular curtain spanning the width of the lettering. Technically much more work for sure (you'd have to do some magic with negative spaces), and you'd have to make sure it's not too "literal", but it might turn out really nice. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hmmm... <br>Yeah, I was going for sober. As for leafs... yeah, I've heard more than one say it. This wasn't a commissioned design in the usual manner though, and the aurora theme wasn't in the brief. <br> <br>The spacing between them gets wider for smaller logos, as I've been down that road before. It's quite a simple shape though, and it stands up well in a fax. <br> <br>thanx anyway, looks like I've got an ok for the type, feels nice. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Not only do the swooshes look like leaves, they somehow remind me of Svenskt n&auml;ringsliv's logotype as well. Might be the gradient. So I'd skip the gradient, change green for purple and follow Hrant's advice on making it look more like norhtern lights. <br> <br>Adobe Caslon works real nice though! Great setting of it! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm... I don't see the the likeness. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1241.gif alt=svensktnaringsliv> <br>On the other hand, the green has worried more than one person... Leafs stands for growth though, and this institution (I guess, the brief was fuzzy) stands for cultural growth and research... <br> <br>Btw, I've never recall seeing purple northern lights... seriously, I might be wrong, but most of the time it's green. <br> <br>As for the Caslon, I'm quite satisfied, I shrunk it a bit and now it looks great.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh well, doesn't really matter anymore. <br>They have choosen another logo... <br>This on the other hand looks alot like svenskt n&auml;ringliv's logo... not to mention it will break apart in a xerox machine or a fax (strange, as a good representation in B&W was in the brief) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1242.gif alt=logo> <br> <br>I think I did better, what do you think?</div>

<div class=commentbody> Richard, your design must have been too "classic" for their tastes - which makes me think they didn't know what they really wanted at first, or maybe simply didn't communicate it. <br> <br>That swirly logo thing is pretty lousy. And I think Trebuchet looks horrible at large sizes (even though it has a surprising readability in text, for a sans). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> ohh, it was trebuchet! I was actually wondering what typeface it was <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br>I think it is quite a friendly font... although I haven't used it for anything but webpages (it looks surprisingly good as shorter body copy). <br> <br>Anyway, their brief was very fuzzy and I tried to make the best of it.. Basically what the above logo is (if you look closely), almost the same swoosh I've used, but rotated with a gradient. <br> <br>I'm ok though, as I find my piece better, it's still going in my portfolio. (as a suggested design or something...) </div>
