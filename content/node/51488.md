body: "hello everyone, I'd like to show you the sans I'm working on. I still have
  fix some details to fix like the width of the bold \"u\", but i think it's getting
  close to finish and maybe there is something escaping my eye. Could you please comment
  it?\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded a pdf if you want to look at it more closely.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gesta_6442.jpg]"

    w are nice (might be a touch dark).\r\n\r\nI like the i/j dots.\r\n\r\nThe fi
    ligature looks like a crash to me.\r\n\r\nI might widen the u."
