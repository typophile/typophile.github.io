  just south of Atlanta, and though it might be fun to have some sort of \"Typemeet\"
  with people who share this same affliction. :)\r\n\r\nI have a small collection
  of type related books, mostly mainstays like /Fontbook/, /The Elements of Typographic
  Style/, /TDC/ /Designing Type/, and issue 1 of /Codex/, but there's others. My collection
  of type specimens are in storage out-of-state so can't share that."
