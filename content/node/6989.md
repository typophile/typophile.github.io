body: What if one were to commence designing a face that relied strongly on the color
  of the original--and I mean color in the sense as used by the rest of the world,
  not the &#34;blackness&#34; of forms that we, here, refer to as color.  What if
  the face was gold, for example, and the designer felt this to be as important as
  the letterforms themselves--is there a way to &#34;imbed&#34; color codes &#40;from
  the HTML pallette seems most logical&#41; in the font so that, whether used in Word
  or AI or whatever, the user sees the intended gold? <BR> <BR>Some might say that
  it&#39;s just easiest to suggest that the end user manually change to this color
  on their own, but I think a certain aesthetic is lost when instructions are doled
  out. <BR> <BR>So what&#39;s the consensus?  Some kind of macro in FontLab?  Not
  possible yet &#40;or ever&#41;?

  body: The only outline format I know that allowed you to specify color was Type
    3, but it&#39;s pretty much dead. Other than that, you need a bitmap format AFAIK.
