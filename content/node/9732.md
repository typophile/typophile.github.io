  body: I agree these were done by hand, but as far as &#34;inspiration&#34;... they
    seem to be all over the map. The R in the lower sample owes something to DIN but
    the C, A and G are way off. Top sample - slight resemblance to Trump Medieaval
    in the serifs but not the shapes. <BR> <BR>Ya got me.
