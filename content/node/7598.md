  my entire hard  drive and look in all of my MS-Word, WordPerfect, CorelDraw, Crystal
  Report, and other such files and give me a list of all of the fonts which have been
  used. <BR> <BR>Then I can use the list as a guide to remove a LOT of unused fonts

  body: That sounds kind of dangerous. That said, I use Suitcase X1 to manage my system
    fonts on OS X so perhaps Suitcase can manage your system fonts on your PC ...
    I&#39;m assuming you are on a PC ..

  body: Such a utility would be useful, but I believe to successfully create such
    a tool you need access to the specs for each type of file and many of these are
    unpublished. If you find something let us know.

    you just Search &#40;your C drive&#41; for &#42;.ttf ?

  body: I think he actually wants to read the font tags in all of his files, then
    create a list of those fonts that are on his machine that aren&#39;t used in any
    of his files. He wants font references, not the fonts themselves.

  body: 'Hello, There: <BR>As the original author, I believe that Chris and Simon
    seem to have the right idea, even though I do NOT understand specifically the
    meaning of the term &#34;font tag&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for searching for &#42;.TTF
    - the fonts in use are indicated in their respective documents by font names and
    NOT by their file names; also, they are frequently stored in double-byte mode
    with interspersed x&#39;00&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>Ideas appreciated..'

  body: When I say &#34;font tag,&#34; I&#39;m referring to the font reference made
    in the underlying code that determines formatting for a span of characters in
    the document. I am &#40;perhaps incorrectly&#41; referring to these code references
    as &#39;tags&#39; because of my HTML-centric coding experience.

  body: Speaking from a standpoint of a font tech-ignorance, I would guess that this
    problem is probably not unsolvable, but is way more complicated than any solution
    would be worth. Ultimately, a good font manager should keep your machine running
    cleaner and is much more practical. <BR> <BR>It just seems overly-complicated
    to approach the problem in this manner. Also, you could just remove all of the
    unused, non-system fonts and re-add/activate them as you open documents &#40;even
    easier with a font manager&#41;. It&#39;s a small bother when you&#39;re working,
    but it&#39;ll save you the trouble of creating/buying an automated solution. <BR>
    <BR>How many fonts do you have on your machine, out of curiosity?

  body: 'Hm, possible, but time-consuming: produce a pdf-file of each document, then
    combine several small pdfs to one big pdf. Looking at the document properties
    in Acrobat, e.g., will reveal all the document&#39;s fonts by their font names.
    <BR> <BR>Next step would be finding the matching file names &#40;on a PC I&#39;d
    choose &#34;typograf&#34; because in ATM it&#39;ll take some more clicks to get
    to the font-properties&#41; and their location on the hard drive.'

  body: Wow.  <BR> <BR>And I was just thinking about how long it would take for a
    program to search each and every document on my computer for font tags. <BR> <BR>I
    think Suitcase, Font Reserve, ATM Deluxe, or some like program is probably a better
    choice. You can de-activate fonts and then have them auto-activate whenever you
    open a document where it&#39;s required. <BR> <BR>Plus, you get a better way to
    organize and scroll through your typefaces. Just because you&#39;re not using
    a font now doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t ever use it. <BR> <BR>It also saves
    you from moving typefaces out of your Fonts folder and then having to put them
    back whenever their service is once again required. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure
    which font organizer is best. Perhaps others in this forum will be able to inform
    you better about the pros and cons of your choices. <BR> <BR> <BR>Laura- <BR>It&#39;s
    nice to see I&#39;m not the only one who does things the hard way.
