  body: The kgreenlandic (kra) has a lowercase form only. Good question as to what
    to use in a small caps setting (or in an all caps setting, for that matter). We'll
    need an expert to weigh in, but other than avoiding such a setting, my inclination
    would be to design a usual kra glyph that matched the height of the small caps
    (typically slightly higher than x-height) and another to match cap height. But
    that might be seen as incorrect by native users. Just looking at Minion Pro, I
    don't see anything other than the normal x-height kra. The kra is now replaced
    by "q".

    if you add them to your font, people should at least be able to use it correctly.
    And when they switch to small caps and these letters would stay lower case, that
    would not be quite elegant ..."

    have a uppercase mapping in Unicode. \r\nWhat should happen when the [smcp] feature
    is applied? Are they 'small capsed' and if - do they keep or lose their accents?\r\nWhat

    making a special small cap shouldn't be too hard ... But the design issue & the
    technical one are seperate. John, you are saying that Indesign should be doing
    something. What do you think of putting code in to point to the correct Special
    glyph. Isn't that what happens All caps & Small Caps anyway?\r\n\r\nI have been
    increasingly convinced that a seperate Small cap font rather than a single font
    containg Roman Caps & Small Caps is a good idea anyway since Indesign & other
    apps don't have a very elegant way of handling the issue yet - and may or may
    not evolve one. Do you agree?"

    actually disagree here; the one claims upper-case Kra is K\u2019 (K + U+02BC modifier
    letter apostrophe), the other, K\u02BB (K + U+02B<em>B</em> modifier letter turned
    comma&mdash;which is supposed to look like K\u2018 <em>i.e.</em> K + left single

    Greenlandic orthography (and the one responsible for the kra, if I understand

    1851 Greenlandic grammar</a>, doesn't seem to have cared about capitalization.
    I've skimmed the contents at Google Books, and nowhere does he seem to use capitals
    for any Greenlandic words. His German is far more sparse on capitals than I am
    used, for that matter.\r\n\r\nI tried to find examples of Greenlandic books in
    the pre-1973 orthography at Google Books, and found <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=fiETAAAAYAAJ&q=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&dq=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&lr=&pgis=1\">this
    example</a> which has the form K\u2019\xE2n\xE2\u0138 (Qaanaaq in today's orthography)
    with what looks like a modifier letter apostrophe. So score one for SIL. This
    is just one example, though, and it's a rather small sample size. I would like
    to see more, but it's difficult to find a fully browsable book written in pre-1973-orthography
    Greenlandic at Google Books for copyright reasons.\r\n\r\nI did find <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=VkYaAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject%3A%22Greenland%22&q=diary&pgis=1#search\">this
    snippet</a> of part of a map with \"K\u2019\xE2n\xE2\u0138\" written by hand,
    but it's too small to see what's really going on in there with the diacritical
    marks."

    book. So this issue is likely something that conforms to its own set of conventions,
    and Everson and SIL are not arbitrarily inventing anything. They are merely describing
    what seems to have been standard practice.\r\n\r\nNick: <cite>This is so obscure
    you could probably set your own standard.</cite>\r\nThis is a whole language and
    a literary tradition you are talking about. Do you think type designers should
    disregard the accepted practices just to have fun in designing a new glyph, which
    would only serve to cause confusion in the representation of historic spellings?
    At least the German eszett is still in use so the possibility is there for a gradual
    acceptance of a capital form.\r\n\r\nThe archaic Greek letters pre-dating the
    bicameral divergence of the Greek alphabet are a fun challenge for type designers,
    because there is a need for them, as you said. That's where we can exercise creativity
    and work toward building up some kind of consensus. The Kra doesn't need our help."

    from, say, C) would provide consistency with the lower case treatment. I mean,
    the lower case character isn't just a \"k\" with a diacritic, is it?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kras_6601.png]\r\nBut
    this is hypothetical, there are other more useful characters to put in fonts!\r\nThomas
    Phinney made a good point in his blog, when discussing which Cyrillic characters
    to add to a font, that using the number of speakers of a language is a good criterion.
    So if there are a lot of speakers, it's useful to support a language. And perhaps
    also if it's endangered. But really, what possible use is there in retconning

    the same event into a single historical reality.\r\n\r\nSo this is more like anti-retconning,
    suggesting an alternative universe/history that has continuity with the present
    day--referring to historical continuity, not continuity between the cases as mandated
    by Unicode. \r\n\r\nReally it's just historical fiction, although I do like the
    Marxist overtones of \"revisionism\".\r\n\r\nIn type design, a comparison might
    be the Renaissance style of Petrine Cyrillics, or Storm's 18th century sans serif,

    solid/absolute. You could take either position legitimately as long as you acknowledge

    precedent - and then step out from there if at all. But doing that is only my
    prerogative - not the only right way. \r\n\r\nIt is important to consider that
    a language with not a ton of readers & not a a ton of books was probably given
    less thought & consideration typographically speaking than other languages. It
    seems likely to me that the glyph design solutions they evolved might be a bit
    too slapped together and could stand being reconsidered especially if it was done
    in a manner that was culturally historically sympathetic. Acknowledgment that
    a given solution is <cite>completely legitimate</cite> doesn't preclude new ideas.
    How do you know that the Kra couldn't be helped? I don't! The world can't be split
