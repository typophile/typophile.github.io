  I'm trying to set the pronunciation of a word in Century Schoolbook, but lacks the
  schwa, as well other pronunciation characters.\r\n\r\nSo, I suppose a broader question
  this brings up is: why are symbols like the long vowels (vowels with a macron) and
  schwa not in the standard character sets for fonts? Most of them are simple modifications
  of other letters, no?"

    sense for the specialists who need these characters to pay the cost of developing
    them.\r\n\r\n<cite>Most of them are simple modifications of other letters, no?</cite>\r\n\r\nThere
    are no simple modifications of letters. A letter can\u2019t just be flipped or
    warped a little and still look good; thought has to go into it. And then it has
    to be proofed and edited. And kerning must be taken into account; characters with
    funky shapes and stuff above or below can\u2019t just be thrown into regular kerning
    classes. In a family, this has to be done for every master and checked again in
    every interpolation. So, depending on the design of the font, you\u2019re probably
    looking at at least five minutes of work, and possibly much more, per character,
    for every single font within a family. And now that everything is global this
    stuff can\u2019t just be limited to what Western Europe and North America uses;
    it has to work and be checked with dozens of languages. And none of that accounts
    for all of the research that goes into figuring out how all these characters are
    used so that they can be produced and tested. That is why characters like schwa,
    symbols for typesetting complex equations, and letters/accents for dead languages
    aren\u2019t going to start turning up in most fonts any time soon."

  body: "James, let me disagree partially with you. <strong>Some</strong> characters
    are really simple variations from another ones, even about kerning and spacing.
    But others just <strong>seems</strong> to be simple.\r\n\r\nAnd about characters
    support, I also think we're still highly determined by Western European culture.
    Some largely used non-European languages, with write tradition and using Latin
    alphabet, are fairly marginal to our type standards, while some almost extinct
    languages from Europe deserves a lot of attention both in Unicode and in type
    tradition.\r\n\r\nI believe this would slowly improve with time, with more and
    more fonts with a wide language support."

  body: "Hello all, thanks for the comments. I hope that anyone here who's met me
    knows that I understand the work that goes into a single weight, let alone a full
    family, so I realize that every little bit inflates this large time commitment
    further. Your answers make sense, and I anticipated it would be basically a matter
    of spending time on the most needed glyphs. I was curious if there are technical
    limitations, but clearly there are not (or no longer are).\r\n\r\nI also realized,
    after I posted, that this is another case of \"if you start with one, you have
    to finish with dozens\", so it makes sense that pronunciation characters would
    be pretty uncommon.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to a question: any pointers for creating
    one's own schwa? I'm setting a dictionary-style definition that'll be set in roughly
    50pt type, so I'd like it to look good when shown at full size. So far, the only
    typeface in my library that I've come across which actually contains a unique
    schwa (rather than a simple rotation) is Garamond Premier Pro (thank you, Adobe).
    It looks like the primary structural differences between the e and the schwa are:\r\n\r\n1)
    A larger counter, which raises the horizontal stroke in the schwa\r\n2) The aperture
    of the schwa is a hair more open, as the lower stroke doesn't curl back in as
    much before terminating\r\n3) The thin of the lefthand stroke of the schwa is
    thicker, but this is also likely a function of this particular typeface's stroke
    axis\r\n\r\nAny other things to be mindful of?\r\n\r\nCheers."

    taste and understanding of typographic logic.\r\n\r\nIn Oneleigh, it seemed to
    me that a simple rotation of \"e\" was out of character with an irregular old
    style face.\r\nSo I made the top left terminal more like that of \"a\" (for micro-detail
    following letters such as \"r\" and \"t\"), and enlarged the bowl, to make it
    less like the \"a\" when viewing text en masse.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schwas_4673.png]\r\n<em>e

  body: I usually adjust the relative counter space in the schwa, as Nick has done,
    and optically adjust the weight transition and curvature going from the top into
    the right side, but I generally avoid a terminal on the upper left.
