		<div class="commentbody">How exactly are your clients making these PDFs? I think that will help identify what may be going wrong. PDF is now an ISO standard and the only reason why a PDF would not work correctly is if it is created incorrectly to begin with (meaning the PDF creator is not following the standard correctly) or if the reader application doesn&rsquo;t interpret the PDF correctly (which usually means the reader is out of date).</div>

<p>If the fonts are properly embedded into the PDF, you don&rsquo;t have to load them on your system. That&rsquo;s the whole idea behind PDF basically. Everything needed for a piece of work (images, fonts, color profiles, etc.) is embedded into the file.</p>
<p>If the fonts are listed in the properties, it should be fine. So I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the problem could be&hellip;</p>

<p>I actually just did a test. 2 newsletter pages 8.5 x 11 pdfs straight from the client and placed both pages in quark and indesign and printed the 2 pages from each program. The indesign pdf printed fine. The quark one couldn&rsquo;t even place the pdf because &ldquo;It was an unrecognized version of a pdf&rdquo; or something. Then I tryed bringing the pdf into preview on my mac and resaving it and bringing it into quark . it worked! BUT the fonts printed out all screwy. I have a postscript printer (hp laserjet 5100m) so there is no issue there. So it&rsquo;s quark and the client&rsquo;s fault. Who the heck uses publisher for print anymore? Well I have been told it&rsquo;s out of date and a no no.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What layout app is that - QuarkXPress?</p>
<p>It is possible for a PDF to have a hyperlink to completely external content (say, a web page), but that&rsquo;s truly external content, and validating such links would seem to be outside the scope of a page layout program. InDesign does not validate hyperlinks in a placed PDF at placement time, any more than it validates native hyperlinks in InDesign. (Leastways, that&rsquo;s my understanding - maybe this is a feature that got added in CS4, when I wasn&rsquo;t looking.)</p>
<p>Fonts are usually embedded. All other content which is part of the PDF is embedded in the PDF.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Is a pdf is a EPS? You say Mr. Phinney it is not. Well, thats true, it is not, but it behaves like one. All elements within the file, fonts, vector, bitmaps are embed in it or not, in the case of fonts. I did work with pdf work flows that run only on pdfs, due to files coming from Macs or PCs and, in a couple of situations when I had pdfs made by others and sent to me that not just had no embed fonts and incredidible it may sound, my rip, a level II Scitex PS/M was asking me for the links! Checking the pdf using Enfocus Pitstop I removed the OPI info, External Links, Annotaions, Invisible Data, Meta info, etc. on the file and tried again: same result.
To finish that job I opened the file in Photoshop, reworked the images, converted the text to 1-bit tiff and assembled the file again using Quark and finally I got the file to rip.</p>
<p>You mention Quark. Yes, there is trouble sometimes placing pdfs in Quark (6.5 and up). I would say that if one has trouble with pdfs, the best way out is using Adobe software to fix or import to. Quark is very good at producing files and they work anywhere, and like everything else, and that includes Adobe, there are trouble sometimes (mostly by operator error).</p>
<p>Indesign (Illustrator-PageMaker) is the best thing out there to place or produce pdfs, you know that, and I agree. No matter what, if one has a .ps file produced from any app (could be Freehand 2.0) and distill it, then you have got yourself a file that works anywhere.</p>
<p>My comment on a pdf being a EPS is general, because in the end, it behaves just like one when imported or placed.</p>
<p>A tip: If you export a pdf from Indesign and try to open it with Preview the pdf fails to open. The same file after being “saved as” with Acrobat will be opened by any pdf reader from Adobe or others.</p>
<p>Another tip: If you have a eps made in Mac OS X or Classic mode you can produce a pdf as good as it could have been using Acrobat, only that sometimes doesn&rsquo;t embed fonts if the font doesn&rsquo;t allow embedding. In that case, convert font to curves and that is the end of the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do, but in my case, I am dealing with single page artwork. If you are dealing with multi-page docs, then, you need the real thing: Acrobat &amp; Distiller.</p>
<p>So, my understanding is, a pdf behaves like a eps; PDF os EPS, one has to know what is gonna happen with that file when you send it to the print shop. Basically.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll agree that as commonly used, EPS and PDF often behave similarly. But EPS is a much more free-form and less structured format. It can handle anything the PostScript language can do. From a technical perspective, an EPS file can be software, not just a document; it is not necessarily static. A PDF is completely deterministic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>“ You never did address my question about what layout apps you’re using that check links in PDF files or ask about missing linked material. ”</p>
<p>The app that was asking for the links is (was) Creo PS/M 7.1. It is a OS 9 app, a very good rip. I could rip the file with a option to let go and rip with error, it would message missing links. Then, looking at the CT file it was a low jagged image. Removing OPI on Acrobat/Pitstop should fix the problem, but again that file wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>“ I’ll agree that as commonly used, EPS and PDF often behave similarly. ”</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s is what I said, just that I said it IS - should have said it is alike when you are importing it to a graphics app.</p>
<p>” I design alot of books, so multi-page work, and again: I never had any problems with the PDF’s that InDesign creates. ”</p>
<p>As for Preview not opening a pdf exported from Indesign, it happened to me every time I tried.</p>
<p>Yes, Indesign makes the best pdfs. Just that Preview on Mac OS X 10.4 seem not to like them, on the occasions I tried opening them after they were created. The same pdf would open in Acrobat and, after ”saved as” the file could be opened in Preview.</p>
<p>Now, Preview isn&rsquo;t a app when preflighting pdfs, for that you can use the real thing: Acrobat. I use Preview cause I don&rsquo;t have the real app. It works for me, as I convert eps&rsquo;s out of old FH55 and Qrk 3.32 (&hellip;).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Mac Preview (and the entire OS/Quicktime renderer) has issues with <em>some</em> PDFs, mostly due to their being CMYK, or having CMYK images (like JPEGs) dropped into them. Not always, but often displays as &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; colors.</div>
