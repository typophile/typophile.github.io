body: "I'm looking for advice on how to handle dropcaps in an instance where a single-line
  paragraph kicks off a chapter.  InDesign gives the new paragraph an extra indent
  on the dropcap's baseline, which I actually thought was a pretty fair fix, but the
  folks I'm doing it for aren't entirely sure about it.  One suggestion was to basically
  make the dropcap a raised one in this instance, but I really don't like that shift
  in continuity.  Was wondering if there's any preferred rule on this or any precedent
  from pre-desktop publishing days anyone knows off hand?\r\n\r\nThanks and best,\r\nAaron"

    as seems to be happening here. If there are enough instances of this in your text
    then you are going down the wrong design road. Hell, if I had to design a book
    with even one such instance I'd ditch the drop cap and come up with a better idea.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "There are different ways of designing dropcaps or initials, one of them possibly
    suit your situation. Though these ways will hardly come as InDesign defaults,
    I suppose.\r\nHowever, don\u2019t rely on the application\u2019s functionality.
