body: "A longstanding feature, the auction was dropped from TypeCon last year.\r\nIt
  involved serious logistics to organize, and despite the efforts of volunteers, the
  large overheads involved meant that it didn't always pay its way. To be a success,
  it was dependent on getting good donations, and spirited bidders.\r\n\r\nTypeCon
  attendees -- did you miss it?\r\nAre your bookshelves overflowing with typographic
  exotica you'd like to donate?\r\nWould you rather acquire such stuff from the antiquarian
  bookseller at the conference, or does an auction's excitement, serendipity, and
  the prospect of an amazing bargain hold more allure?\r\n\r\nShould we have an auction
  at Boston?\r\n\r\n--Nick Shinn, Board Member, SOTA (TypeCon organizing body)"

    activity, but it does not seem a good match with the more...hardscrabble, blue
    collar, if you will, ideals of Typecon. \r\n\r\nCan we have flea market, or Bazaar
    instead? Nothing over $40, mostly used...something more...quarrelsome."

    added them to the inventory and the proceeds went to SoTA, only problem with this
    approach is what to do with things that don''t sell. Really need someone to take
    them home and ebay them after the event. '

  body: "My two cents...\r\n\r\nMinnesota was my first TypeCon, and I thought the
    auction, hosted by Dave Farey and Chank, was great fun. San Francisco's auction
    didn't seem to pack as much punch, true, but I missed having it in New York. I
    would only have two or three items to donate if it was done in Boston.\r\n\r\nMy
    vote is YAY, bring it back this year!\r\n\r\nSuggestion: maybe it could be done
    every other year, to let people miss it a bit, and to allow for several items
    to be collected."

  body: "<em>flea market, or Bazaar</em>\r\n\r\nThat would perhaps be too similar
    in format to the vendor's area.\r\nThe \"bluecollar\" items at SF were the things
    which dragged it down, many donations of, for instance, small specimen leaflets,
    ending up bundled together and bought sight-unseen.\r\n\r\nBut I hear what you're
    saying about the clientelle: I was bidding for an item at TypeCon Minneapolis
    and dropped out at a couple hundred $ (spousal limit imposed) -- the item went
    to the other guy for a steal. I later discovered that an acquaintance would have
    liked it for his university library, and would have paid thousands for it. So
    the trick is to get \"the right product for the market\". A donation of fifty
    1923 ATF specimen books would work."

    of the fun things about the auction... \"If Nick is bidding on it, it must be
    worth having\" or \"That fuse collection will be broken up and on ebay by Monday\"
    - few people have any idea of what things are worth, some stuff goes for a song,
    and other stuff is vastly over-bid, and most people have no idea."
