body: I&#39;m working on a college catalog, and want the same font that is used in
  Communication Arts, but nothing looks exactly like it. It&#39;s the font that&#39;s
  used in light green at the top of most of the pages. Anyone know?

    a scan of the lettering you would like us to identify?

  body: Ack! I had a post written, but I guess it didn&#39;t go through. That was
    one of them, here&#39;s one from the inside pages. Do you think it&#39;s the same
    font, just a different weight? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67436.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>It was a custom chancery, if I remember well. <BR> <BR>&#40;?&#41;

    same as Univers.

  body: 'Univers has two different ampersands, a conventional one and an alternate
    one that looks like an Et ligature. Not all digitizations of the font have the
    alternate one. You can see it <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ltunivers/430-basic-reg/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>.  <BR> <BR>Historical footnote: The alternate ampersand
    was the original. The conventional one was added later.'

  body: Aside from those two Linotype fonts, Bitstream&#39;s Univers clone <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/zurich/light/testdrive.html?s=%26&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Zurich</a> seems to be the only version with the original ampersand.  <BR>
    <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t understand why they still call it Zurich. They made a licensing
    arrangement with Linotype to use the Linotype names about a year ago.&#41;
