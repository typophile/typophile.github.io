<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello! <br> <br>I have a small business I do on the side which is graphic design and websites. I am in the process of creating a business card for myself. I would like to do it on clear plastic like Mike Haska did in a previous post. <br> <br>The blue area is going to be clear. This will allow the white border/stroke around the 'eh' to stand out and the white stripe at the bottom to also stand out. <br> <br>I am going to print the white stripe at the bottom on the back of the card to give it some depth. I would like to do the same the same for the white around 'eh' but am unsure if that would look ok since it would be on the back. <br> <br>I would be greatly appreciative any comments on my design - layout, design, fonts, etc. Say anything and it will be taken in consideration... <br> <br>Thanks for the help in advance - Troy <br> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/62922.jpg alt="Business Card"></div>

<div class=commentbody>The maple leaf seems small for the size of the white outline. It chomps into the leaf like an insect would. That poor little stem is almost cut off. <br> <br>Reducing the "eh" or enlarging the leaf (maybe rotating and only showing a portion of it) would eliminate the eaten leaf effect. <br> <br>The list at the bottom shouldn't start with a hyphen, and I'm not sure hyphens are a good choice for separators. If you do use them, they should only be between items and evenly spaced.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think your text is a tad large. Hang the punctuaion (on Ave.). Loose the bullet points at the bottom, IMHO. It makes it look like a yellow pages ad. Lumping Graphic design with Computer sales seems quite odd. <br> <br>If you want to offer these services, I'd suggest making multiple cards. (eh Design, eh Computer Sales, eh Web Hosting) etc. <br> <br>As for the logo...it's a clever canuck reference, but, at the same time, somewhat negative, isn't it? "How's my work? eh. so-so."</div>

<div class=commentbody>Troy, everything is to big. Reduce the size of everything allow some white space. Don't tell the whole story of your business, allow a potential a chance to ask questions. Your copy at the bottom makes you seem like a Kmart (you do everything). I would change it to read: Website Hosting </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all the tips and thoughts. I am going to play with it a bit tonight and when I get changed I will post it again. <br> <br>As for the Computer sales I am getting into that on the side with a frind of mine I think I will remove that since that is not a major part of the business. <br> <br>As for the eh chomping into the leaf I am going to make the white border around it a bit smaller but I have been using this logo as it is for awhile now. <br> <br>Good thought about the hyphens and the . after Ave. <br> <br>Thanks again for the suggestions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Troy, <br> <br>Just a note on material type. Even though I started off with the intent of going with a plastic card, I eventually decided to go with a translucent paper. My main reasons for the switch were to facilitate a faster printing time, to reduce costs, and because I wasn't 100% comfortable with completely clear cards. <br> <br>My concern was that in a business card folder or a stack of cards, my card might 'disappear' when the the card behind it shows through. I was a little worried that my card would be too much like a chameleon, blending in with the background... <br> <br>Since your card has a large, colourful logo with a white border, this effect might be mitigated, but I can tell you that I've had tonnes of compliments with my translucent cards (I don't think I've suffered because of the switch, in any case.) <br> <br>Also, on the design of your card, I would agree with the comments suggesting sizing down the elements to increase the amount of white space. Also, you might try swapping the position of your name/title and your address. I think a more central location on the card would give your name more precidence over the other elements... <br> <br>Can't wait to see the redesign! <br> <br>-Mike</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Darrel and Daniel's suggestions, but would also like to see you revise your typeface choices. Your logo face is between a print and a script, in that limbo with Comic Sans. Maybe try using your own handwriting or creating a few custom letters in Illustrator. On the other extreme, the body copy on the right just looks transcribed. Try exaggerating the sizes; you can read down to 7 or 8pt comfortably with quality printing. <br> <br>I'd like to see some iterations with more playful placement of the card's elements.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would have to say, increase the type size, especially on the bottom line, <br> <br>Nothing would emphasize LOWER PRICING than just making the leap straight into Comic Sans. <br> <br>Eh?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure I agree with all of the thoughtful comments posted here but I do concur that the maple leaf is a bit dwarfed by the "eh." <br> <br>I am also interested in purchasing a business card that is transparent with two color ink used for the text. Does anyone know of a good printer in Canada that makes them? <br> <br>Thank you, <br> <br>Ken Bleyer</div>
