    already :o)\r\n\r\nThere's a book on colors called \"Colors: What They Mean and
    How to Make Them\" ISBN: 0810992922, it tells you how to make your own dyes. Very
    cool! The entire book is set Filosofia. You might like it. Then you can make me
    sweater or mittens or some other @#$%.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \"natural\" and \"chemical\") -- it's a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nCheck out some of my
    recent work at http://flickr.com/photos/lasquetipress/531715021/in/set-72157600981297396/
    and http://flickr.com/photos/lasquetipress/1105982906/in/set-72157600981297396/\r\n\r\nAnd
    for the little silk tapestry <a href=\"http://bp3.blogger.com/_2vzdfysYew8/RemxLNa8WiI/AAAAAAAAABA/VbaJGuYuneo/s1600-h/LMC2B.jpg\">here</a>,
    the two outer stripes were dyed with commercial grade food colouring!  ;-)\r\n\r\n(I
    charge a lot for custom work, Mike: email me for details!)"
