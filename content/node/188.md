    the magazine courses, but the guy who does seems to think that it&#39;s a great
    book. Maybe it&#39;s worth a shot...

  body: there is magazine about magazines called Masthead. <a href="http://www.mastheadonline.com"
    target="_blank">www.mastheadonline.com</a> There was also a publication that came
    outa few months ago about the best 25 in 25 years? something like that - has an
    orange and red cover with a big 25 on it - you could probably get it at any magazine
    store. <BR>

  body: Thanks a lot <BR> <BR>Maybe i need to explain a bit more now, i&#39;m not
    really interested in books like &#39;the more fun magazines in the world&#39;
    or things like that. I mean i&#39;m not searching infos about magazines that don&#39;t
    look like magazines. I need infos on how to organise and design a serious magazine,
    and about the grids used. As as i said many of the books are only about book design,
    and its pretty different. There are some materials on how to make a newspaper,
    its bit more close i think, but not enough. But maybe there is a real lack in
    this area. <BR> <BR>Anyway thanks for the all the info provided, i didn&#39;t
    bought any books for now on the subject because i was not really impressed of
    what i seen online, but maybe i&#39;m gonna try it now and spend some books &#40;

  body: 'Surprise Me and Praxishandbuch Gestaltungsraster, both from Hermann Schmidt
    Verlag, are pretty good. Alas, they&#39;re of course written in German.  <BR>
    <BR>Brodovitch was a master -- and the Fleckhaus book is marvelous, I agree...
    Gotta check out that Lois book. It&#39;s a shame that there is nothing about the
    work of Khan, which precludes Brodovitch. '

  body: Masthead &#40;the mag about mags&#41; isin&#39;t about what mags are hot...&#40;well
    there is a back section about the upcomings&#41; But really its an excellent resource
    for following and understanding trends, content, organization - lots of crits.
    For instance there was a big uproar in the magazine world about a certain issue
    of Flare that had a pinch of product placement on the cover &#40;a big no no!&#41;
    and that was discussed at lenght in Masthead. the 25/25 isin&#39;t the 25 prettiest
    either, its about what was truely innovative abotu certain spreads, articles,
    illios, editting stuff like that.  <BR> <BR>anywho - maybe its not as technical
    as you would like, but I don&#39;t think anyone should design by a how-to-book
    in any case.
