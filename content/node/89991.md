body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI've looked over the great posts that are here for this and
  I think I've settled on the code below, which I grabbed from the Adobe Caslon Pro
  font. It's nice and compact and should suit out needs just right.\r\n\r\nIt all
  seems to be working fine but I'm not completely clear as to how the single quote
  works and I don't want to end up in a \"A little knowedge is a dangerous thing\"
  situation. An Adobe page states that the single quote \"Marks a glyph or glyph class
  for contextual substitution or positioning\" but I'm still lost.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any help you can offer my feeble mind.\r\n\r\nAll Best,\r\nKen\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>@frac1regfigs=zero

  body: "I don't think you should put single quote at all. Single quote identifies
    the glyph in the contextual chain, that needs to be substituted in that context.
    The other glyphs without single quote in that context remain intact. If you don't
    put anything, the substitution will apply to all glyphs in the context.\r\nIn
    this case, since all two or three or four or whatever number of glyphs in the
    contextual chain will be removed and replaced by a single glyph, you don't need
    to use the single quote. I'm actually surprised that it did work for you. But
    it should be more work for CPU I guess.\r\nI'm interested to know more from experts
    on this too."

    @frac4fracsdnom @frac2numr' by @frac3dnom;</code>\r\n\r\nIf he removes the other
    single quotes the code will likely not compile since then you will have a single
    lookup containing two different types of rules. He would need to split <code>
    frac02 </code> into two separate lookups.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Ah-ha! I thought that was how it worked. The glyphs (or classes) that have
    the single quote will be substituted. Right?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Adnre is right, that
    line needs to leave the @frac4fracsdnom  alone. The other lines all have it to
    remain within the same lookup. I assumed for efficency?\r\n\r\nAny other info
    will be more than welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch guys!\r\n\r\nKen"

  body: "Yes, when you have something <code> sub @A @B' @C by @D </code>, the apostrophe
    is needed to distinguish the substitution target from the substitution context.\r\n\r\nIn
    the example you give, I can see no reason why it would have to be a single lookup.
    You could break it up into\r\n\r\n<code>lookup frac1A { </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub
    zero.numr slash zero.numr zero.numr by perthousand; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub zero.numr
    slash zero.numr by percent; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub one.numr slash two.numr by
    onehalf; </code>\r\n<code>\_\_# etc. </code>\r\n<code>} frac1A; </code>\r\n\r\n<code>lookup
    frac1B { </code>\r\n<code>\_\_sub @frac4fracsdnom @frac2numr' by @frac3dnom; </code>\r\n<code>}
    frac1B; </code>\r\n\r\nIn this case, the apostrophes can be omitted in the first
    lookup. They are only needed when the final line is included since you can't include
    both ligature and contextual substitutions in the same lookup. The apostrphes
    force the ligature rules to be interpreted as contextual substitutions which happen
    to have the same effect as ligature substitutions.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Andr\xE9, while I have your \"ear.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the line sub @frac4fracsdnom
    @frac2numr' by @frac3dnom;: The first line of the feature changes everything to
    numerators, it then does the fractions that are built as glyphs. However, there
    is nothing in the line I mentioned above to indicate which side of the slash the
    numerators (class @frac2numr) are being \"searched.\" I was assuming that because
    there is a dnom feature (as describded here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm)
    the frac feature is matching the glyphs in the @frac3dnom to the denom feature
    and knows to substitute only to the right of the slash. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nFont
    work like this isn't my main function here, so commenting this code with what
    is happening will be immensly helpful when I come back into it later. Not sure
    where I'd be without this forum!\r\n\r\nThanks very much again for your time,\r\nKen"

  body: "Ken,\r\n\r\nThe line <code> sub @frac4fracsdnom @frac2numr' by @frac3dnom;
    </code> specifies that your fraction numerators will be replaced by denominators
    *only* when they follow elements in the class @frac4fracsdnom. Since this class
    includes the slash along with 'slash-containing' glyphs, that's what determines
    that numerators will only be changed to a denominator following the slash. The
    dnom feature, whether implemented or not, doesn't play a role in this.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
