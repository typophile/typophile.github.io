  content is \"Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nI need a free font that goes well with it, for the
  headlines/subheads. What do you recommend?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm also using
  Calibri. For context: My book is primarily made of verses, and those are in Georgia.
  Anything that *I* wrote is in Calibri. \r\nIf you want to suggest an alternative
  to this also, it is welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: And Calibri isn't really recommended here, is it? Actually I'm not convinced
    Carter's sans typefaces are good choices for book typography either.

  body: "Trebuchet and Corbel are not free, but you probably have them if you have
    Calibri. I once used Trebuchet and Georgia in manual and liked the results. One
    advantage of Corbel is that its default figures are old style and would therefore
    match the default old style figures in Georgia.\r\n\r\nA number of free sans serif
    fonts (listed below alphabetically) are readily available for you to download
    and consider:\r\n\r\nClear Sans from Intel\r\nFira Sans from Firefox\r\nLato from
    Google Web Fonts\r\nNoto Sans from Google Web Fonts\r\nOpen Sans from Google Web
    Fonts\r\nSource Sans Pro from Adobe\r\n\r\nFira Sans and Source Sans include small
    caps, if that matters.\r\n"

  body: "For a long time, and in more recent years off and on, it was considered the
    height of interior design skill to use one typeface for  both text and display.\r\n\r\nPlaying
    on that notion, I'd at least take a look at Charter, free in the versions released
    & distributed by one of the TeX groups. Charter will be quite similar to Georgia
    -- a familial resemblance -- but lighter in weight, so more in keeping with the
    larger sizes in heads. If in fact you want significantly larger sizes in heads.
    Space can be used for emphasis, often more effectively than type size.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/charter/\r\n\r\nFor
    a sans, Lato might work, if you absolutely must have a free font. TheSans will
    work if you don't mind paying a bit. With sans, pay attention to the lower case
    g's and y's when pairing with serif text fonts."

    heard of this rule. It's logical to me, but I also know that many sans typefaces
    simply don't have a double-storey /g, and I'm assuming that's what you would want
    to match it with the serif /g."
