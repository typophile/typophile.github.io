  body: "Thank you, Eben, I love these samples. - Is this the actual colour of the
    paper? And if it is, do you this the paper has darkened over the centuries?\r\n\r\nAnd
    another question: Did I see right that the pages are not - in German it is called
    \"registerhaltig\" - the lines on the front and the back of the page do not correspond?"

  body: "The paper color is far from exact. Sorry! I think the paper is of high quality
    so it may have darkened a bit but overall I would say they are holding up remarkably
    well.\r\n\r\nI did not look for registerhaltig being present or not. But it's
    a good question. I will see if I can tell and if not I will look again the next
    time I am near one of these."

  body: "1499? Fantastic! That's old! \r\n\r\nSorry, but my knowledge of books doesn't
    extend much beyond my Architecture and Art library.\r\n\r\nAfter some further
    reading about Hypnerotomachia, seems that monks had a clever way of getting their
    name out... \r\n\r\n\"While the authorship of this book remains a mystery, it
    is generally believed to be the work of Francesco Colonna, a Dominican monk who
    lived in Venice. Colonna's name is revealed in the book by taking the first letter
    of each of the 38 chapters to spell out 'Poliam frater Franciscus Columna peramavit',
    meaning 'Brother Francesco Colonna loved Polia tremendously'.\"\r\n\r\n...now
    I'm wondering if monks had their own code?\r\n\r\n  "

    time.
