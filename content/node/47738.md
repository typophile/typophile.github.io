  to publish local editions of UK magazines along with reprinting one-shots. We own
  licensed copies of all the fonts to be used on the local editions but not the titles
  which we intend to reprint from PDF's, though creating new covers, and some additional
  pages.\r\n\r\nLegally are we supposed to own the fonts used in the PDF's? It seems
  to be a grey area. If I needed to amend pages, I could theoretically extract from
  the PDF's the areas I don't need to affect/can't as we wouldn't have fonts. The
  question is, would this technically be illegal or could I argue that we are reprinting
  material with small changes??\r\n\r\nLook forward to your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\np.s.
  I should point out we are not trying to dodge the bullet on cost, just trying to
  understand the legalities."

    - ie for workstations at one location. Obviously outmoded in today\u2019s world
    of laptops but none-the-less that's what the licenses say.\r\n\r\nMost licenses
    allow PDFs to be passed around organizations, so you're probably okay sending
    PDFs to the overseas office. \r\n\r\nBut the editing of covers etc., seems to
    be tricky part. You don't open PDF's, right? You send InDesign of XPress files
    plus a bundle of fonts? If so I don't think the overseas office can avoid licensing
    these fonts for use locally. If they want to stay legal.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    their licensing agreement (that comes with your purchase of the right to use their
    fonts) also the right to embed their fonta in a PDF (although some manufacturers
    of Arabic fonts do not include this common right).\r\n\r\nThere is however another
    difficult legal problem when you use some US font manufacturers' font designs
    or even public domain Unicode data in Europe. This is because in Europe, there
    are different laws pertaining to font designs and public domain Unicode data that
    are not applicable in the United States.\r\n\r\nSo, if your magazine PDF uses
    legally licensed fonts obtained in the US, the PDF file may contain embedded illegal
    fonts in Europe.\r\n\r\nI am unaware of a legal court decision or precedent regarding
    this. Hence, there will be a an unwillingness to enforce action because the issue
    is so unclear."

    *digital* vector outlines of letters were indeed subject to copyright, based on
    point placement. \r\n\r\nI would have to clarify for SII, disagree with Dezcom,
    and agree with Thomas.\r\n\r\nWe are discussing two issues here:\r\n\r\n1) the
    software instructions, which are subject to US copyright like any verbal expressions
    are subject to US copyright, to describe \"intellectually\" the shapes of letter
    forms.\r\n\r\nIn years prior to the the advent by Adobe of PostScript fonts, the
    prevalent font format was bit maps. The US Copyright Office ruled that the software
    instructions which made up bit map font technology were not \"intellectual\" or
    verbal instructions, and not subject to registration for US Copyright. Instead,
    bit map fonts were \"mere digital data depicting letter forms.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    when Adobe introduce outline typeface software, fonts took on a totally new meaning.
    Outline typeface software was not \"mere digital data depicting letter forms\".
    Rather, they were \"intellectual\" verbal instructions, like any verbal expressions
    are subject to US Copyright, and in deed subject to full US Copyright without
    any disclaimers.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I worked at Font World, Inc. of Rochester,
    NY. I was engaged in a fascinating correspondance with the head of the US Copyright
    Office about my registration of various sets of typeface software programs. That
    head person of the US Copyright Office wanted me to add a disclaimer to my registration
    application that I was only registering the software programs, but not the instructions
    which rendered the shape of the letter form. She insisted that such descriptions
    were not \"intellectual\" verbal instructions, but \"mere digital data depicting
    letter forms\", and hence not subject to US Copyright.\r\n\r\nI refused. I argued
    that this is comparable to retelling a story. One person's account os different
    than another person's account. One storyteller embellishes the story by choosing
    certain words, and another person tells the story differently. Similarly, two
    type designers describe exactly the same type design, in two different ways. Although
    the typeface software programs are the same in a sense that they describe the
    very same design, nevertheless the typeface software programs are very different,
    as Thomas points out that \"Judge Whyte seemed to say that the *digital* vector
    outlines of letters were indeed subject to copyright, based on point placement.\"
    The key  words are choice \"point placement.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, the refusal
    to add a disclaimer was accepted, the typeface software programs were accepted
    for registration, and the US Federasl Court ruled in Adobe's favor to protect
    their intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n2) the actual design of the letters
    - there is no law protecting one's ownership to a design of a letter form, according
    to US Copyright law. On Europe, however, there are laws which protect one's ownership
    to a design of a letter form. At Linotype, in Haupage, Long Island, NY, I saw
    fascinating technical drawings of letter forms of popular Linotype designs for
    submitting to the US Trademark Office. This is a novel and costly approach, but
    in the US Trademark Office a design can be registered and protected. This may
    be a way to solve the whole issue."

  body: "Just to clarify, the US protection of the actual design of letters is \"design
    patent\"; it's the \"US Patent & Trademark Office.\" Unlike copyright, you have
    to actually register the design to get design patent protection. Or at least that's
    my understanding, I'm not a lawyer, etcetera.\r\n\r\nT"

    of each character and letter form to meet the requirements of the US Patent &
    Trademark Office, this was done so their actual design of characters and letter
    forms are admissible \u201Cdesign patents\u201D.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a lengthy,
    time-consuming, and costly, approach to protecting ones design patents. A company
    as large as Linotype, or Monotype, or Agfa, maybe even Adobe, could do this. But
    smaller type foundries certainly can not.\r\n\r\nIn Eurupe, I don't know what
    are their requirements to secure a design patent. Perhaps, it is the same, or
    perhaps it is rather less lengthy, less time-consuming, and less costly.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    in Europe a letter form's design is recognized as intellectual property, like
    Unicode data from a public domain text. In the United States, it is not.\r\n\r\nWhy?"

    money, though. I find the fee schedule a bit hard to decipher, but I gather the
    total cost will be several hundred dollars. Luckily design patents don't have
    the major maintenance fees which apply to utility patents.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants
    to see what a recent Adobe patent application looks like, go to the USPTO Web
    site, and do a search for patents with the title \"Type Font\" (we use the generic
    title for all of them), or for inventor \"Slimbach; Robert\". Unfortunately, it
    costs money to actually acquire a copy of the patent filing.\r\n\r\n(Usual disclaimer:

    of Linotype manufacture in the mid 20th century. It would not surprise me to learn
    that copies of these may have been submitted for the purpose of design patent
    application.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've never before heard the contention that these
    drawings were done expressly or primarily for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMechanical
    drawings were created for every character of every size of every typeface design
    as a critical part of Mergenthaler Linotype's manufacturing process. And it was
    just that, a manufacturing process. Creating fonts of Linotype matrices was a
    complex machining process, with very minute and precise tolerances, and required
    complete and thorough blueprints for every piece. \r\n\r\nI doubt that MLCo would
    have maintained an extensive drawing office -- with two levels of management and
    scores of workers, not to mention an extensive q.c. process -- just for the sake
    of preparing patent applications.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."
