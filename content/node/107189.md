  body: "If I recall correctly Jean Luc Godard's movies used lettering rather than
    fonts as such.\r\nA fan has made a Jean Luc Godard font based on the lettering
    in some of his movies: http://www.carvalho-bernau.com/jlg/\r\nIt's heavier and
    less rounded than the letters in your image, but has an interesting discussion
    of the lettering used in the movies.\r\nThere are several fonts that resemble
    the one in your image such as Intertype Vogue, not digitized. I trust that one
    or more of my colleagues will give you a list of digital fonts similar to your
    image.\r\nDon\r\n"

    Neutraface 2]] Display which looks pretty close in this case.\r\n\r\nEDIT: the
    more I look at it the more I'm questioning about the sample origin because Neutraface
    2 looks so close that I could almost state it's a match..."

  body: "If the image is from something modern about Godard, then I agree with Ryuk
    that Neutraface is most likely the match. \r\nChristian Schwartz designed the
    font  for House Industries in 2002. According to a wiki on Richard Neutra\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neutra\r\nChristian
    Schwartz based the font on Richard Neutra's  architecture and design principles.
    \r\nDoes this mean that the letters were originally designed by Richard Neutra
    and came to the attention of Jean Luc Godard? \r\nI don't know. \r\nAnyway this
    is all speculation without knowing the approximate date of the sample.\r\nIf the
    objective is simply to reproduce something like the letters rather than to identify
    anything specific, then Neutraface works for me.\r\nDon"

  body: I tend to think this sample is recent, simply using a screen capture of one
    JLG's movie and setting text with Neutraface 2.
