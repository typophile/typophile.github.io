  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Can anyone put me in touch with someone who has the current knowledge of converting an existing book design layout (done in in-design CS6) into an e-book for use on a Kindle reader?
I have just started reading up on it and realise that I might have to change the font/s I have used for the main body of the book and probably a whole lot of things. Luckily the book contains no images, but I do want to retain page ends so that Chapters start on fresh pages. There is also a bit of text styling (custom page numbers, chapter headers etc that may just not be possible on an e-reader.
I have been reading about exporting using fixed page layouts (something it seems you can only do with Creative Cloud though).</p>
<p>I am hoping to use the export E-pub function (within in-design) in order to create the right file.
I assume this leads to a layout which changes size and thus page count, which is fine. But I do want to keep the page ends in at the end of chapters.</p>
<p>Any help would be amazing as I am having to fast-track learn this new way of working.</p>

Having some knowledge of HTML and CSS goes a long way. Here is some [[http://epubsecrets.com/indesign-best-practices-epub-exports.php|general]] [[http://epubsecrets.com/indesign-epub-basics-general-settings.php|info]] on the InDesign side of things, but you should also find an exporting tutorial.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to come to peace with the fact that Kindle supports only the most basic formatting (even less than EPUB, which itself is a far cry from print typography) and a few built-in fonts. So your only option is to simplify the layout as much as possible.</p>
<p>Keep chapters as separate files and they will start on new pages. You won&rsquo;t have page numbers because the text is reflowable; styling chapter headings is fine, though.</p>
<p>Fixed page layouts are almost always a bad idea, especially for simple, text-based books.</p>
