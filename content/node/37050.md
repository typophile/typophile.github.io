  Saul Bass uses for the Movie credits on the Vertigo poster.\r\nIt's a rough, kind
  of hand drawn, ultra light, condensed font. A movie has used something similar lately,
  but I can't remember which one (and it's driving me crazy!!!)\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated. Thanks [img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontid_4786.jpg]"

  body: "Cheers guys, I'm guessing this might've been hand drawn by the great Mr Bass,
    but I'm sure a very similar font has been used recently for some movie (and therefore
    probably replicated for some free font website somewhere)\r\n\r\nBuzzin Fly records
    also use a similar font. http://www.buzzinfly.com/buzzed.html\r\n\r\nIt's pretty
    much all about the roughened look (which rules out Interstate unfortunately)\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help so far. "

    used for \"Stop Making Sense\" by Talking Heads (one of my favorite bands!!)\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    The Pablo Ferro tip was a cracker... I've found a font called Major Kong which
    is pretty close (if only there was a condensed version it would be perfect)\r\n\r\nEDIT2:
    Brilliant, just found this http://type.fargoboy.com/ which is close enough\r\n\r\nThanks
    guys."
