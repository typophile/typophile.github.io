  automated online tools (which previously helped with other fonts)... they only found
  similar but not quite the same fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Wasn't able to spot a match, only (a ton of) similars. It feels also "freebie"
    to me. As always for this kind of font, I'd say it is deeply rooted in "[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/|Bauhaus]]"
    (. Many freebies (an endless list actually) share the same backbone ([[http://www.dafont.com/vomzom.font|Vomzom]]
    is one of them). Having a look to [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic
    > Sans serif]] sections at DaFont could be helpful to spot either an alternative
    or a match. Good luck!
