  came across one of their earlier ones (more of at est video) that was about Helvetica.

  the page, pretty obvious even for the non-Spanish speakers on the board.  The video
  itself just uses the words Helvetica and in one or two places Arial and the style
  names in English.  Awesome video though, definitely worth the look."
