  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working off and on for months on a new identity for my company. I&rsquo;m a web designer/developer, and I also do branding and usability work. Not much print work. Maybe 10% of my clients request logo work.</p>
<p>The work below was inspired a bit by some logos from the fashion industry. I want something more &lsquo;iconic&rsquo;&ndash;that&rsquo;s based on my name&ndash;that isn&rsquo;t just a standard font treatment.</p>
<p>I want to up the sophistication level of my image and not go the standard &ldquo;web 2.0 route&rdquo; that seems so popular these days amongst my web design colleagues. In other words, I want a long lasting mark that can carry over to other companies I might start that also will have my name on them.</p>
<p>I took the font named Dinamo Regular and used it to create the icon you see below.  I&rsquo;ve also included what the standard letters from Dinamo look like that I used. It&rsquo;s However, my sense is that my finesse and execution is off. I&rsquo;m unsure at this point as to how to make it better. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking for help with:</p>
<ol>
<li>insight or opinions on how I might make the icon itself better</li>
<li>Thoughts about using Granby Light (the display font you see) along with it.</li>
<li>Thoughts about the layout of the logo OVER the company name, as opposed to another position, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I greatly appreciate any help in advance. I&rsquo;m definitely more big picture designer than I am strong in typography and icons, but I&rsquo;m trying to improve.</p>

<p>Patty &ndash; I tried that a bit, specifically the second E into the s, and the s into the third e. the transition between the two es, as well as between the r and the e, seemed awkward&hellip;though maybe there&rsquo;s a graceful way to accomplish it that I missed.</p>
<p>Chuck&ndash;I like where you&rsquo;re going w/ the straightforward approach. I suppose I worry about that being a little less memorable. What are the pros that you see in using that kind of approach? That lowercase r does make for a nice mark :)</p>

i would say this: close your eyes for a moment. (really) 
think about the first few logos that come to mind. they are the most immediately memorable to you.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll bet they were very simple marks. the nike swoosh. the macintosh apple. ibm. 3m&hellip;
it&rsquo;s my opinion that the most memorable marks are the most succinct marks. not to say simple, but succinct &ndash; saying what they need to directly, cleanly and clearly. like the gettysburg address. 286 words. wow.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>LOL. Thanks, Chuck. I particularly liked the last one ;)</p>
<p>Thank you also for your idea&ndash;you make a strong point about memorable marks being quite succinct. I always found the Nike swoosh story endearing. And I need to remember that the logo is not the be all and end all. Nike&rsquo;s brand is strong today not because of the swoosh, but because of everything else. The swoosh is just an immediate way to identify it.</p>
<p>Thank you again. Most appreciated.</p>

<p>My husband is my business partner. His name is Jason. Check out that r. Flip it, and you&rsquo;ve got a j. I&rsquo;ve tried, for a LONG time, to find a mark that could somehow represent us both. He disliked what I would do, and I dislike the ones he created.</p>
<p>Yet..now we have a J and and R. I could keep it just that simple r, or I could try to play around to represent the J, too&hellip;though really it accomplishes both. Astute clients may realize this, but it doesn&rsquo;t require them to realize it to be a strong mark.</p>
<p>I got that font for its &ldquo;s&rdquo;, actually. But now&hellip;the r may very well have saved me. Thank you again. truly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello,
I am impressed with your willingness to embrace suggestions made by other readers so I hope I&rsquo;m not out of line offering my thoughts on your latest logotype ideas.</p>
<p>I think the dot under the r/j makes it look like an up-turned j, it no longer reads as an r.</p>
<p>The third idea works best for me because the lowercase thing seems a bit played out; I like the shapes of the lowercase letters but there is a risk of it looking too Web 2.0 (something you&rsquo;re trying to avoid).</p>
<p>The combination of the lowercase, the rounded type, the rounded corner (the &lsquo;r&rsquo;), and the colours are all Web 2.0 staples, so it might be worth dropping <em>one</em> of those elements if you want to keep away from that style.
<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/the-logos-of-web-20/">A list of Web 2.0 logos</a></p>
<p>Are there small caps in the font you&rsquo;re using? this might make nicer shapes and a more classic, timeless logotype (just an idea).</p>
<p>The simple r shape would be very flexible across a range of media and would work without any accompanying text.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you both,
Kristina, thanks for bringing that up. It&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t see/know about, but there&rsquo;s no need to apologize. The majority of my target market is going to be American&hellip;but I&rsquo;m going to look into the campaign you reference as well as run this by a few Canadian friends of mine to see if they have similar reactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An accident.&rdquo; Really good points about the web 2.0 aspect. Last night, I tried one out with the font &ldquo;Priori (San)&rdquo; (LOVE that one) for the title part. I&rsquo;ve included it below in a couple of variations, as well as two versions with &ldquo;Mrs. Eaves.&rdquo; I think I like the 4th one down best, because the lowercase &ldquo;d&rdquo; in it has some similarities to how the &ldquo;r&rdquo; is handled. Priori or Mrs. Eaves might help give it a bit more of a classical feel versus all bubbly/high techy.</p>
<p>Although I like the centering of the bottom one, centering like that can be tough to work with at times.</p>
<p>I appreciate your insights. I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where I don&rsquo;t take criticism personally much&ndash;the only way my work will improve is if others help me see the weaknesses or potential problems in it as well as bring up potential &ldquo;associations&rdquo; like Kristina did. Thank you!

<p>I like the r/j idea. Why don&rsquo;t you play with both in separate shapes, instead of combining them in one symbol? For starters, you can use them to frame something else. Just an example, I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with something better :)</p>

Thanks also for that link. What a great write up&ndash;it will help a lot with my &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that font&rdquo; questions for clients ;)</p>
<p>Nell, thanks. One of the things I&rsquo;ve enjoyed about posting this here is the brainstorming it&rsquo;s helped me do. I have a hard time with sketching/coming up with concepts. Sometimes other&rsquo;s ideas help trigger new ideas in my brain. I wish I had a few outsourcers or employees who I could brainstorm with all the time! :)</p>
