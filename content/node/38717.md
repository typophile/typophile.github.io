  body: Back when personal computers had only one font and not much that passed for
    graphics per se, they had this. You used them to make borders and primitive diagrams
    on your 80-characters-wide, 25-lines-high text screen.

  body: The box characters are also used to produce documents like tax forms. These
    characters are standard in a variety of HP PCL symbol set encodings in HP printers.
    The shade and many of the block characters are also encoded in some HP PCL symbol
    sets.

  body: "Thanks you guys! \r\n\r\nIn case anybody finds it useful I should also mention
    that I found a programmer who has written a terminal emulator who explained that
    his interest in these glyphs comes from the fact that terminal emulators can often
    look much worse when the font used has badly spaced box drawing glyphs - which
    is apparently nearly always now. This goes for the shade & Block glyphs as well.\r\n\r\nSo
    if you do make these legacy glyphs - test em. I plan to do just that this week.\r\n\r\nEric,
    That is wonderful stuff albeit in a slightly different vein. "

    - line draw characters are a must for 'console based' apps. But in general once
    you've drawn one set you should be able to re-use them when customers ask for
    them.\r\n\r\n>So if you do make these legacy glyphs - test em.\r\n\r\nOn a related
    note, same goes for teletext characters - but as many of these are not in Unicode
    it makes life somewhat harder. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    how would you test them at MS?"

  body: "Wow! What amazing & dubious uses these things can be put to! ;-)\r\n\r\nBut
    actually I started testing - and I was using this text file and I found that despite
    all my glyphs having a standard width; when I use a UTF-8 test file I get inconsistent
    spacing! Very odd. But maybe there is a missing glyph. Or... I have no idea. Do
    you?\r\n\r\nHere are some clues from screen capture.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4035.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5155.gif]\r\n\r\nThe

    glyphs that I don't have yet - & Braille. So I suspect a glyph that I don't have
    yet...
