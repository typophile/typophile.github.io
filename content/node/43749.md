  of me remember. This sample is from Martin Gothic - Thin by URW, but it's a pretty
  cruddy old Postscript version. I know that it's a knockoff of a \"real\" face, but
  I can't get my addled brain to pick it. Any help for a momentary Alzheimer's sufferer?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/martin_4176.jpg]"

  body: "No, I thought of Kabel too (it's similar... at least, to the old style of
    Kabel).\r\n\r\nWhat you can't really see in this grab is the sight flare to the
    stems -- it looks and fits like a sans, but it's really a serif with teeny-tiny
    bumps.\r\n\r\nThis sample makes that clearer... it also shows the ratty connection
    of the crossbar of the \"e\" to its round.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ve_3871.jpg]"
