body: Either my Google-fu is failing me or I just don't know the proper search terms.
  I'm looking for a guide to opentype. Figuring out ligatures, old style figures etc
  is easy enough, just open a font that has them. But what about more complex substitutions?
  And how do stylistic alternatives work? For instance, say there is a font with regular
  caps and lowercase as well as small caps and "petit" or x-hight small caps. What
  if I want to create a hierarchy so that selecting one option gives regular and small
  caps while a second option gives small caps and x-height caps? What about contextual
  alternatives within these sets? How would one go about describing it in Fontlab
  in a way ID understands? Thanks.

  body: i've been meaning to put together an [[OT_How-To]] in the [[TypoWiki]]. I'll
    try to answer all your questions there as soon as i get a chance. But first things
    first... do you have a copy of [[Leslie Cabarga]]'s [[Learn FontLab Fast]]?

  body: well in the meantime... you can start by reading the <a href="http://www.font.to/downloads/FL46WinDoc.pdf">FontLab
    manual</a> chapter on OpenType. It's actually very helpful and should answer most
    of your questions.

  body: "This is a good reference for opentype features.\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/ttoreg.htm\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the hierarchy of the features comes from the order that you put them in. For instance,
    if you put your standard ligatures before your small caps, you could end up with
    lowercase ligatures sticking out of small caps words. It took me a few minutes
    to figure out the best way to order things the first few times I tried it. "

  body: "<em>But what about more complex substitutions?</em>\r\nThe FontLab manual
    references this. And you can take a look at Bickham Script Pro's feature file,
    I referenced it in my [[OT_How-To]]. Let me know if what i've written so far is
    helpful, Noah.\r\n\r\n<em>how do stylistic alternatives work?</em>\r\nif you have
    one alternate, do a simple one to one substitution:\r\n<code>sub x by x.salt;</code>\r\nif
    you have many alternates, do something like this:\r\n<code>sub x from [x.salt1
    x.salt2 x.salt3];</code>\r\nIn Adobe CS products stylistic alternates can be implemented
    in a few ways: contextually (automatically) with the \"calt\" feature or they
    may be accessed via the glyph pallete when you set up a \"salt\" feature. Adobe
    CS2 products have the added support of stylistic sets, which will allow the font
    users to select from pre-defined sets of alternate characters to be applied. Using
    a stylistic set might be the best/easiest way to go for accomplishing your smallcaps/petitcaps
    setting scenario, depending on how you want these to be applied.\r\n\r\n<em>What
    about contextual alternatives within these sets?</em>\r\ncontextual alternates
    should be defined in the \"calt,\" \"clig,\" or \"cswh\" features. If you have
    contextual alternates for small caps and petit caps, you would want to put your
    calt feature after these features so that smcp is applied first and then your
    alternates come in to play.\r\n"
