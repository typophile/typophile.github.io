  body: "Kevin, good find, some features of Ritts Cursive could be adapted to duplicating
    this style of letters. What we also need is something with a lower case where
    the side stokes are rounded rather than the parallel strokes in in Ritts Cursive,
    Thirsty Script etc. Some scripts with rounded lowercase bowls similar to the image
    include Mayfair http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/mayfair/ and Duktus  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/duktus/\r\nAnyway,
    no close match to the lettering, but some possibles for letter forms to duplicate
    it.\r\nDon"
