body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI found one or two months ago some scans of a book called <em>Alphabetum
  Gr\xE6cum</em> (Robert (III ?) Estienne, Paris, 1580). The pdf file of these scans
  is available free on the Desguine Library website. On this, there is the famous
  characters 'Grecs du Roi' from Claude Garamont, in the three optical sizes: Gros
  Parangon (titles and others), Gros Romain (text) and Cicero (footnotes). There is
  a complete set of all the characters with a full bunch of ligatures and abbreviations,
  and so I tried to do some fonts with all these characters.\r\n\r\nThis is my first
  'serious' font, so I'm not very sure of the result; that's why I show an extract
  here to get your comments.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will help me :)\r\n\r\nHere is
  a small example of the font (I took sample text from the Sergei Egorov's <em>Bucentoro
  Greek</em> topic)\r\n\r\nEdit : I finished the Cicero too. Here two samples of text
  of the two optical sizes. Reviews are welcome :)"

    pause in my greek works, I decided to scan the 1583 Granjon's cyrillics in Gros
    Texte/Great Primer (that I added to the Garamont's Romans and Granjon's italics
    of the same size); with that granulous, ancient aspect. Here is a scan from the
    Vervliet's <em>Palaeotypography of the French Renaissance</em> (vol.2):\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/845043Cyrill1a.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nThese cyrillic
    types are very close to the greek uncial. For example, the \u0418 and the \u041D
    (I and N) are respectively identical to the greek H and N (pronouced /i/ and /n/).
    The evolution is :\r\n<ul> <li>H \u2192 \u0418</li> <li>N \u2192 H</li> </ul>\r\n\r\nIt
    also seems that the izhitsa (\u0475) had only a y form, like in the Uk digraph
    (\u0479). The izhitsa with kendema (\u0477) appears as a y with a double grave
    accent (as you can see at the end of the main text 3d line), as an equivalent
    of the greek \u03BF\u03CB. The accentuation seems to be more hazardous than in
    greek, with psilis and varias in the middle of some words."

  body: "Dear Mr Vauthier,\r\n\r\nNice work!\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of the glyph\u2019s
    outlines does not seem to be a problem when printed in text sizes, as you clearly
    intend. On the contrary, it adds to the warmth of the text and the typographic
    colour of the page.\r\n\r\nThe italics seem a bit heavy, while the Greeks are
    too light, comparing to the roman. This is perhaps an oddity of your example page
    by Rigaud/Granjon, which you choose to keep?\r\n\r\nYou may have a look at the
    Greek \u201CText Fonts\u201D on http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/, especially Alexander
    (which has Alexander Wilson\u2019s mid-eighteenth century Greeks in a revival
    by Matthew Carter) and Anaktoria (with the Grecs du Roi, in a revival by Mindaugas
    Strockis). Both have quite some Greek ligatures. However, only Anaktoria seems
    to have their automatic substitutions implemented in OpenType.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    still looking for an extended inventory of Greek ligatures, contractions and breviatures,
    I could help you out with scans from Carl Faulmann\u2019s <em>Buch der Schrift</em>
    (Vienna, 1880), pages 172\u2013176 (Minuskel. Ligaturen und Abbreviaturen), especially
    \u2014 although their source is unclear and very likely not taken from the Grecs
    du Roi exclusively.\r\n\r\nI would definitely advise you to to at least consider
    OpenType scripting for your fonts: the myriad of ligatures make them an ideal
    candidate for a full-blown OpenType font. You could start by opening the above
    mentioned Anaktoria font in a type design application which supports OpenType,
    and have a look at the substitution rules for the Greek. The example shows that
    this is a quite straightforward process:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature hlig { # Historical

  body: "The Greek script is \u2014 like any other current script \u2014 indeed very
    spaghetti-like. This has nothing to do with the letters themselves \u2014 after
    all, the Latin alphabet shares most of its (originating, capital) letters with
    the Greek. It is the way they are written, though, with the running hand, that
    turn letters into spaghetti. Unfortunately Greek printed type kept the cheirographic
    clutter, connecting and upstrokes, precisely due to (amongst others, like Aldus)
    Garamond\u2019s Grecs du Roi. You cannot change that, unless you would romanise
    the Greek and ask for a lot of trouble with typophiles here. (<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/29711\">See
    here.</a>) But the colour you do can change and adjust to go with that of the
    Roman better (like the italics), and without altering the skeletal shapes of the
    letters. If you would prefer so, and thus going astray from your historical example.\r\n\r\nIf
    one talks about OpenType, people usually refer to the features, and to the fact
    that an OpenType font is 16bit Unicode and thus can hold all the characters you
    want. They do not refer to the underlying b\xE9ziers, which may be either in PostScript,
    or in TrueType. It doesn\u2019t matter if you did your fonts in TrueType outlines.
    Anyhow, with FontLab you can generate your fonts either way.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    OpenType features, you may want to read this gentle introduction, which will very
    likely clear some things:\r\n\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html\r\n\r\nIf
    you would like to outfit your Grecs with OpenType substitutions for ligatures,
    historical alternates, contextual alternates, breviatures, &c., we might do some
    work together, share composition rules and code. The big thing is that we \u2014
    or any one that would like to share OpenType feature code \u2014 would have to
    agree on a standardised naming convention for the glyphs; the glyphs one needs
    are alas not in Adobe\u2019s de facto standard \u201CGlyph List\u201D (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Glyph_List\">AGL</a>).

    :\r\n<ol> <li>Granjon's <em>Bastarde</em> (Great Primer);</li> <li>Granjon's <em>Courante</em>
    (Great Primer) in French and Dutch variants;</li> <li>Granjon's <em>Saint-Augustin</em>
    (English) in the French (used by various french printers like Jean de Tournes)
    and Dutch (used by Willem Silvius). You can note that the De Tournes' one is very
    similar to the Plantin's one, that was adapted by Hoefler & Frere-Jones, but there
    are actually a few differences (a, g, r, v, y, long final e, final t, final y,
    initial m, n and v) and there are some extra ligatures too (like \"in\", \"ni\",
    short final \"nt\", \"ho\", final \"in\"), there are a few extra abbreviations
    too;</li> <li>Granjon's <em>Cicero</em> (Pica), adapted from the \"Facecies, &
    Motz Subtilz\", with a few differences from the original \"Dialogue de la Vie
    & de la Mort\" version (thinner f and long s).</li>  </ol>\r\n\r\nI included some
    initials for the 3 sizes (Great Primer, English and Pica)."

  body: "Thanks for your sample setting of the Civilit\xE9. Very nice!\r\n\r\nAs for
    coding eventual OpenType features for automatic substitution of single glyph sequences
    into ligatures, breviatures and contractions, either for Greek, or for Latin (such
    as the examples you give), thorough research is desirable, with regards to implicit
    composition rules that might have been observed \u2014 if any at all.\r\n\r\nThe
    case of the <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+017f\">long s</a> <\u017F>
    (U+017F) shows alone that this is no sinecure, as one can conclude from these
    elaborate discussions by Andrew West: <a href=\"http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/06/rules-for-long-s.html\">here</a>,
    <a href=\"http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/07/long-and-short-of-letter-s.html\">here</a>,
    and \u2014 less relevant for this case, but with some interesting remarks on the
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_rotunda\">round r</a> <\uA75B> (U+A75A
    and U+A75B) \u2014 <a href=\"http://babelstone.blogspot.com/search/label/Orthography\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nOftentimes,
    randomness seems to have been obvious, and, very likely, rules might have been
    different from office to office, even more so between different periods in time.
    One would thus have to decide which composition style or \u201Cgrammar\u201D exactly
    one would choose to imitate through an OT implementation \u2014 there is but one
    <code>hist</code> and one <code>hlig</code> registered feature in the OT specs,
    notwithstanding that history is broad and diverse\u2026 To make things worse,
    or at least more complex, composition rules appear evidently to involve semantics
    too, a level to which OpenType alas has no means or access ."
