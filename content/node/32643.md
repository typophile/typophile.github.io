body: "I have just begun work on this. As you can see, there are a lot of issues.
  Some of the character widths are incorrect, stem widths are inconsistant, and there
  are notches in strange areas. \r\n\r\nI am looking for just general comments. Does
  the face have potential? Any thoughts on the notches? I think I will use them throughout
  the face, but I will have to see how they work out.\r\n\r\nAlthough this face is
  inspired by Clarendon, I frequently deviate quite a bit from my intentions. I am
  aware this concept has been done before(http://www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/index.html),
  but I think I can bring something new to it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clarendon-sans_6309.gif]\r\n\r\nMore
  to come tommorrow.\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nhttp://www.insignedesign.com"

  body: "It's clean, simple, obviously the glitches need sorting out. yes I think
    it does have potential. You could even have 2 versions, one wide, the other narrow.
    I think the notch in the stem of the lowercase b works, but I'm not a fan of the
    rest.\r\n\r\nNice start."

  body: "Thanks for the encouragement Weeman.\r\n\r\nI've made a few changes. It's
    starting to take on some character. I like whats going on with the K, R, etc.
    I need to incorporate that in the rest of the uppercase, and generally make it
    more organic. The lower is somewhat reminiscent of Frutiger, surprisingly. I've
    tenatively entitled it Kinshasa.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Khartoumn_4403.gif]"

    pick ;-)\r\n\r\nThe lowercase g is too heavy, and the both the UC and lc x are
    too wide.\r\n\r\nThe tail on the R is something for an alternate. You should make
    a \"standard\" R. Maybe a J, too."

  body: "Dan,\r\n\r\nThanks for the input. Balanced the upper and lowercase. I agree
    with you on the R K Q and J, so I revised them. I would have liked to have done
    something with them, but they weren't working with the rest of the glyphs. I did
    keep them as alternates, however.\r\n\r\nI've attached a .pdf, in addition to
    the image below, if anyone wants to take a closer look at the letterforms. Ignore
    the temporary spacing for now. http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/kinshasa1.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks
    to all for the comments so far. I greatly appreciate your assistance. I'm looking

  body: "Your 's' and 'S' look like they have been turned upside down. Also, the thickest
    part of the s should be the spine.\r\nUsually, the crossbar of the 'F' is a little
    bit lower then that of the 'E', to fill up the lower gap (but not necessarily
    so).\r\nThe 'g' doesn't work yet, for the most part it lacks the contrast between
    thick/thins. Maybe you can look into 'bdpq', and design some of them individually,
    instead of flipping b and d. :) I think your 'L' arm should be shortened a bit.\r\nAside
    from that, there are the general bezier-inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nKeep working on
    it! \r\nOn a sidenote; I just read 'Designing Type', by Karen Cheng, a while ago,
    which is a very good book that discusses every character of an alphabet in detail.
    Maybe you can use it for designing this typeface. :) I know it helped me design
    mine."

  body: "Quincunx,\r\n\r\nI think I have your issues resolved. I revised the s and
    S (may need some more work). I kept the F as is. The g was redesigned, and I modified
    the pbdq. I may need to go back to these characters again. There may be an issue
    with these characters falling over. I shortened the L slightly.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned
    \"general bezier-inconsisencies.\" Can you be more specific?\r\n\r\nI actually
    own 'Designing Type' and agree that it is a very fine resource. Thank you very
    much for your input.\r\n\r\nI am still not really happy with the k right now,
    and I need to do a few more rounds of revisions.\r\n\r\nCurrent status:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kishasatypo_4449.jpg]\r\n\r\nPDF

  body: "With 'general bezier-inconsistencies' I mean little bumps in the beziers,
    being not smooth. :)\r\n\r\nLike these:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bumps_5413.gif]\r\n\r\nNow
    I have the 's' in the bezier-image, I see it is still imbalanced, it rolls to
    the left. A longer lower-left terminal might help.\r\n\r\nThe 'g' is better, with
    the contrast, but I find the connection between of the tail a bit abrupt. Now
    it is more a tail with a circle attached, but I think it would be nicer if it
    would flow, so to speak, into the lower shape, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g-glyph_6672.gif]\r\n\r\nBut
    then again, that is just my opinion. :)"

  body: The lowercase k is not Clarendon-enough. The strong diagonals on the k are
    so iconic! If you want to make a Clarendon-sans, it should fit in the Clarendon
    genre, just be a new sans serif member of the family, no?

  body: "Quincunux,\r\n\r\nI touched up the s, a and g, among other things. I took
    your advice for the g, but I left the old one in as an alternate. Thank you for
    pointing out the issues with s and a.\r\n\r\nDan,\r\n\r\nI have also updated the
    k. This works quite a bit better.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am using the Clarendon as
    inspiration, I don't feel I need to stay with it exactly. I like to use the <i>use</i>
    of a face as an inspiration, rather than the actual face itself. I would say,
    however, that this has come closer to \"Clarendon Sans\" that I would have imagined.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it's just me, but it has a very \"British\" feel to it. It reminded me of walking
    through Gatwick airport, for some reason. Because of this, I have renamed the
    typeface to \"Stratham.\"\r\n\r\nLatest PDF: http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/stratham.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks
