  body: "Jan,\r\n\r\nI would conclude the same way if it weren't for the hooks of
    <em>\xE7</em> and <em>\u015F</em>, not to mention the hat of <em>\u011F</em>.
    I haven't been able to find any versions where the hooks and hats are like the
    ones in the sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\nCan\r\n\r\n "

  body: "The g breve is definitely a g dash (overstrike). Maybe the cedilla letters
    are something different too, the sample is too small to make it out clearly. \r\nJust
    coming back from Istanbul (Saturday) I have noticed that in Turkish typography
    the special characters are often not of the same quality as the font itself. In
    particular, the cedillas and breves are often too delicate. \r\nHere is a particularly
    unlucky example from a huge poster on Galata Bridge with a problem that is familiar
    to all Fontographer users :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ccedilla_4185.jpg]"

    more clearly:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_3955.JPG]\r\nI would be
    tempted to think these were the results of an ad-hoc variation, yet this form
    is so common that it must be available as an off the shelf family. \r\n\r\n___\r\nCan"

  body: "I\u2019m pretty sure this is a home-brewed customization. They had some DIN,
    but a version without the Turkish characters they needed, and have quickly added
    the missing bits themselves."

  body: "NTV, A Turkish TV station, employs this typeface to set the text in their
    news slider (located at the bottom). Weirdly enough, in order to set the descriptions
    at the bottom of news pieces, they employ the proper version of DIN, i.e. one
    with a curved hat above <em>\u011F</em>, and a disjoint/angled hook below <em>\xE7</em>
    and <em>\u015F</em>. This has either gone unnoticed or is being done on some purpose,
    maybe out of a size consideration. \r\n\r\nAll told, I am led to believe there
    is an off-the-shelf package that features straight breves and joint/perpendicular
    hooks.\r\n\r\n___\r\nCan"

title: (x) Somewhat similar to DIN, but what?
