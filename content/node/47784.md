  body: "Why Dez Boulder is well-suited to food packaging: the counterspaces are round
    and organic, like tomatoes, oranges, apples, grapes, berries, that kind of thing;
    the letter outlines combine curves with straight lines and angular shapes analogous
    to the boxes, jars and tins we buy food in. The whole thing could work very well
    as an analogy for packaged food.\r\n\r\nSo I think Dez Boulder will be ideal for
    food branding & package design :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
