body: A friend has a new boat, and he wants to call it &#34;Aiki&#34; which is the
  first two characters in &#34;Aikido&#34; and means something like &#34;in balance
  with the energy of the universe.&#34; <BR> <BR>I promised him a logo for the boat
  &#40;back when he wanted to call it &#34;Phoenix&#34;&#41; so I have to figure out
  what, exactly, the characters &#34;Ai&#34; and &#34;Ki&#34; look like. I have  a
  bunch of caligraphed samples, but they vary quite a bit and I don&#39;t have a good
  feeling for what is essential and what is ornament. I tried a search the UniHan
  database, and go 1816 hits for &#34;Ai&#34;... none of which looked like the samples
  I have. &#40;There was one character that was close, but the definition listed was
  &#34;bushy black hair&#34;, which my friend has, but I doubt he wants that put on
  his boat.&#41; <BR> <BR>Can any of you help me out of this mess? I&#39;m in way
  over my head. Thx.

  body: A few things to consider. The Unicode UniHan databse is, as the name implies,
    a unified Han database, which means that you need to be aware that the reference
    glyphs in the Unicode Standard may not be appropriate as a model for specifically
    Japanese use. What you need to do is get your hands on a Japanese dictionary.
    I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770028555">this
    one</a>, which has the benefit of including a Unicode reference for every character.

  body: Also, if you&#39;re using a Mac, there&#39;s <a href="http://jedict.com/">JEDict</a>,
    which is mostly a program for the decipherment of kanji, but which can also be
    set up to be a pretty good Japanese-English dictionary &#40;I use it a lot when
    surfing Japanese sites&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are two spellings in Japanese for
    aikido, according to JEDict, and they use different characters for &#34;ki&#34;.
    I&#39;ve appended a GIF of both spellings set in Hiragino Kaku &#40;a sans serif
    equivalent&#41; and Hiragino Mincho &#40;the &#34;serif&#34;, or semi-calligraphic
    equivalent&#41;; if you want some of the calligraphic equivalents &#40;as in true
    Japanese / Chinese calligraphy, as seen in classical Asian art&#41;, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0844284343">this
    book</a> has them. You could browse it in a store, but figuring out how to use
    kanji dictionaries takes time, even ones as well-designed &#40;for Westerners&#41;
    as the dictionaries John and I mention. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s worth pointing out that
    &#34;aiki&#34; on its own isn&#39;t a word in Japanese, at least not in the dictionaries
    I have. I&#39;ve highlighted the characters for &#34;ai&#34; and &#34;ki&#34;
    in vermillion, and left the &#34;dou&#34; black. The top spelling is probably
    the one you want to use; the bottom is antiquated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/67282.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>The ideogram for &#34;ai&#34; has a Unicode number of 5408, and
    the first alternate for &#34;ki&#34; has a Unicode number of 6C17. The second
    alternate is 6C23. Good luck!

  body: Forrest, is it possible that the first &#34;ki&#34; is just a simplified version
    of the second &#40;as in simplified versus traditional chinese characters&#41;?

  body: It&#39;s almost certainly the product of Japanese language reform, yes. The
    Japanese government looooves language reform. I think they just finished another
    round, in fact.  <BR> <BR>But both spellings are in the dictionary, so I thought
    I&#39;d include them both. My character dictionary merely says the alternate form
    is &#34;nonstandard for [standard form for &#34;ki&#34;:spirit, which discus won&#39;t
    let me insert]&#34; without any further etymology. I don&#39;t have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0804820368">New
    Nelson</a> or an actual Japanese kanji dictionary, so I don&#39;t know any more
    about its provenance.

  body: Also, searching Google using the old spelling yields 22,800 hits, both on
    Japanese and Chinese web sites &#40;mostly dojos and aikido associations, which
    makes sense&#41;, so that spelling&#39;s not uncommon in use.

  body: Besides the actual characters that will end up as/in the logo, do think about
    the nautical angle in terms of the stroke structures - and maybe work in a &#34;reference&#34;
    to anything unusual the boat &#40;or maybe its owner&#39;s mane!&#41; might have.
    Like in Forrest&#39;s black glyph, the bottom horizontal stroke could extend in
    a wavy action? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks to one and all. I should have come here 2 weeks ago, instead of googling
    my head against a wall. <BR> <BR>It was actually a fun experiment, looking at
    hundreds of glyphs, and trying to decipher what was important and what was not.
    I can see similarities, duplications and variations in the stokes that compose
    the characters, but I have no idea whether the variations are artistic license
    or meaningful. One of my first guesses for &#34;ai&#34; actually means &#34;thick
    black hair&#34;... which is pretty funny, &#39;cause that&#39;s what my friend
    has. <BR> <BR>W/ the help of John&#39;s suggestion I came up w/ a graphic similar
    to Forrest&#39;s ... except that I didn&#39;t figure out the archaic version,
    which would have helped a lot because the caligraphy samples I was using as a
    guide all used the old version. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I&#39;m thinking about abusing
    the characters to create a logo, but I had to find out where the starting point
    is ... plus I need to make sure I don&#39;t morph the characters into a different
    meaning. <BR> <BR>Kinda fun, now that I&#39;m making progress. Thanks again.

  body: 'According to Japanese teachers, there are 200-something &#34;radicals&#34;
    that can be composed to create kanji. In fact, unless you&#39;re looking at very
    simple characters, just about every kanji can be broken down into constituent
    components. These parts sometimes are themselves characters, which can provide
    clues to the meaning of the kanji in which they&#39;re included, but there&#39;s
    no necessary correlation between a set of radicals and a character&#39;s meaning.
    Kanji are the end product of 2,600 years&#39; worth of random evolution, gradual
    refinement, and premeditated simplification, so it&#39;s safe to say that all
    of the strokes in a character, and the spatial relationship between those strokes,
    are all important. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s why I included the kaku / gothic version
    of each word: that&#39;s pretty much the barest letterform you can have and still
    get the essential meaning across, unless you&#39;re an actual Japanese typographer
    and know which rules you can break &#40;translation: I myself have absolutely
    no idea, and my grasp of Japanese is rudimentary at best&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;When
    studying Japanese writing and type, all kinds of blarney gets shoveled your way
    about the importance of stroke order, direction, and formation in Japanese handwriting.
    Some or all of that might have been true back when people wrote primarily with
    brushes, but these days, everyone uses ballpoints, and Japanese handwriting is
    just as rapid and sketchy as most laptop-using Europeans&#39;. Quite frankly I
    have no idea how most Japanese people read each others&#39; handwriting at all.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Anyway, good luck with your logo project, which sounds fun, but be careful!
    Remember all those Japanese T-shirts saying &#34;Let&#39;s lucky alligator!&#34;
    and the like: hapless mistranslation is charming on a 17-year-old girl in Harajuku,
    not so cute on a big, expensive boat.'

  body: According to the <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html">wwwjdic</a>,
    &#34;aiki&#34; means &#34;belch&#34;. But &#34;aiki&#34; is also used as part
    of &#34;aikikai&#34;, which is the Aikido World Association, and also <a href="http://www.aikinews.com/">aikinews</a>,
    so I think you&#39;re actually OK. The wwwjdic is the ideal tool for this kind
    of search, because you can click on &#34;Examine the kanji in a selected compound&#34;
    and get further details. The two versions of &#34;ki&#34; are indeed the result
    of simplification.

  body: '&#34;aiki&#34; also means &#34;favorite plane, camera, or other machine&#34;,
    and is the name of a city in China near the Russian border, but all three &#40;the
    two aforementioned and &#34;belch&#34;&#41; are all spelled differently than the
    aiki in aikido. I&#39;m not really such a pedant most of the time, but Japanese
    is full of homophones, and I thought I ought to clarify when I said &#34;aiki&#34;
    isn&#39;t a word, I meant, aiki spelled as it is above. Sorry, should have said
    so in the first place.'
