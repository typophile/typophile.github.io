  body: "A well-designed card. \r\n\r\nJust one suggestion: I\u2019d like to see more
    contrast between \u201Csoftware\u201D and \u201Cnerd.\u201D \r\n\r\nTry to find
    a typeface with a light weight (for software) or a heavy/black weight (for nerd)
    as opposed to just roman and bold, and I think you\u2019ll be golden (the red
    you use for nerd on your website helps, but even there you could benefit with
    some weight contrast between the two words).\r\n"
