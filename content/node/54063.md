  yet I cannot access the Element\\Build\\Build Composite Glyph menu (both Build and
  Build Composite Glyph are greyed out). \r\n\r\nI am not in Bitmap view.\r\n\r\nCould
  you please tell me how I can access this menu?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCaleD"

  body: "You have to have a glyph space selected, either in the font or glyph view,
    that FontForge thinks is eligible for compositing (i.e., most ligatures and digraphs,
    and most but not all accented characters; e.g., fi, fl, oe, OE, ij, IJ, i, j,
    \xE9, among many others, but not ae and AE for some reason). Furthermore, the
    source parts for the combined glyphs must already exist.\r\nThen you can select
    options from the Build submenu. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder File> Preferences... there is
    an option to set the accent compositing height. I've been meaning to write to
    George about that bit. I think it should be in font info rather than the overall
    prefs, since that may change from one font to another, and it would be useful
    to have that carried with the particular font."

  body: "Ah, I see.\r\n\r\nSo encoding the font as Latin 1 doesn't seem to give me
    the option of adding ligatures, but if I encode it as Unicode BMP I do have this
    option in some spaces.\r\n\r\nI loaded Myriad Pro into FontForge just to see where
    these ligatures were hiding, but I couldn't seem to track them down in the table
    (I'm sure there's a better name). However, if I load the lookup subtable, FontForge
    gives me a preview of the ligature. \r\n\r\nWhere are the ligatures (fi, ffi,
    ffl, ff, fl, ct, st etc) hiding, and what encoding is generally recommended?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again"

  body: "Unicode BMP is the encoding I'd recommend if you're going to output an OpenType
    font. Naturally you aren't going to fill every one of those slots. As for which
    glyphs you <em>need,</em> I suggest a union of Latin-1, Latin-0, Macintosh Latin,
    Windows Latin, and Adobe Standard. Then set it back to Unicode BMP once you're
    done.\r\n\r\nStill, that's kind of a clumsy way to deal with it. This article
    might prove more useful: [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html#more]].\r\n\r\nYou
    will find some of those ligatures in amongst those encoding tables. Some you will
    have to add in yourself. Some ligatures have no assignment in Unicode. Both those
    that do and don't should be addressed with OT features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFontForge
    has the View>Goto feature that can help you find those difficult to locate glyphs
    and unicode ranges."

  body: "Apologies, I have a couple more questions (for now!)\r\n\r\nWhen I install
    the font and use it in Illustrator (CS1), it seems to make the first character
    'invisible'. That is, the first character that appears when I type is the second
    character that I typed. This problem doesn't occur in MS Word.\r\n\r\nAlso, I
    can't seem to get the space character to work properly in either programme (in
    MS Word, a space becomes Times New Roman and in Illustrator it doesn't appear
    at all). In FontForge's Metrics window, however, the space displays as it should.
    \r\n\r\nSorry for so many questions, but you have been very helpful!"

    the kerning.
