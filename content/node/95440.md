body: I'm guessing that this may be a hand-lettered cover, but I'm wondering if someone
  could request something similar. I'm interested in both the "Dangling Man" typeface
  and the "A Novel by". Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1962_6380.jpg]

  body: "\"A Novel by\": don't know anything, even loosely similar\r\n\"SAUL BELLOW\":
    can't find a match. /S is very \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/scotch+roman/fonts/|Scotch
    Roman]]\", serifs are \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/BODONI/|Bodoni]]\" (flat,
    thin, straight and horizontal or may be because of scan quality/blurry effect/perspective
    distortion). A [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bauer+bodoni|Bauer Bodoni]] would
    have been fine but /B, /E and W are off. /L, /E right finals and /W, /E are close
    to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/baskerville|Baskerville]] but all (flat) serifs
    are off... Definitely not an answer..."

  body: "Thanks, Ryuk. \r\n\r\nI'm most concerned with finding a condensed Bodoni
    or Didot typeface that would be good at display sizes. I really love the \"Dangling
    Man\" one. I especially like the curved serifs on the n and a. Does anyone know
    of any others like that? All the similar ones I'm seeing have curved serifs only
    on the italics.\r\n\r\n(Note: I meant to say \"recommend\" not \"request\" in
    the original post)"
