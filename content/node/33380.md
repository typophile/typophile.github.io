    accepted!\r\n\r\nBTW last year I took my students on a short walking tour of Old
    Town Pasadena - basic stuff, from a basic teacher - but they did start seeing
    the \"parallel reality\" of letters, so engrained but so hidden in everything
    we see. It's like The Matrix.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Last fall I attended the TDC Type walk Paul Shaw led in lower Manhattan,
    and found his commentary very interesting.  \r\n\r\nTwo interesting more general
    points were: \r\n\r\n1. A lot of the carved letters on buildings are influenced
    by models from architectural manuals. So, for example, the reason for many  similar
    signs and letters in New York City that served as the model for Gotham is that
    the model was in fact in a book that the sign creators used. These architectural
    books are a source of letters to an extent independent of type. \r\n\r\n2. What
    works in type doesn't necessary work as signage or carved letters. In particular
    he mentioned that Garamond, a great printing type, is generally speaking quite
    poor for signage...\r\n\r\nHis book on this promises to be a delight. "
