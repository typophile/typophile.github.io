body: Hi There, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m finishing off some design boards and can&#39;t decide
  upon a face to sit with the &#39;House Script&#39; face from House Ind. <BR> <BR>I
  have used the Script sparingly &#40;on some boards just as a logo, whilst others
  I have also used the &#39;House Brush&#39; to compliment comic strips&#41;.   <BR>
  <BR>I am looking for a face for the body copy of the boards. <BR> <BR>So far I have
  been experimenting mainly with sans based faces, Any suggestions would be great.
  <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>Dom <BR> <BR>
