body: Anyone know of, or have had any experience with a really good large format printer?
  &#40;not the giant print stations for 10k aprox. :P&#41; I&#39;m in the market for
  one at the moment, and i don&#39;t realy care for the price i just dont want any
  f&#42;&#42;k ups if you know what I mean. Ive read some reviews and i just stray
  away from anything with major mechanical problems in the long run. So now im kinda
  stranded. Currently I&#39;m reviewing the Canon i9900 or i9100, but that&#39;s all
  I&#39;ve seen so far, and i have&#39;nt found any decent practical reviews on them
  realy. &#40; maybe its a good thing because theres nothing bad about them :D &#41;
  <BR>Suggestions ?
