  body: I dont know what to say, that is really beautiful and artistic but at the
    same time very thought to identify caps letter.

  body: I see a "P" inside the "O" and the "Q", I think the idea is great and the
    shapes are very sexy, but it needs cleaning, capitals are indeed hard to identify.

  body: Something like this would be quite beautiful translated into motion. With
    shapes melting into one another, twirling and growing. (Not to say it isn't interesting.)

    advice would you give on the clarity of the characters?\r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany \r\n\r\nIt's
    a real shame I have no grounding in animation or moving image, but it's a nice
    idea."

  body: "My first post :)  Weeman, I think this is just a fantastic looking typeface.
    \ It kind of reminds me of sheet music with the curls and the straight lines.
    \ It is unusual which makes it very unique.  I know you probably still have a
    lot of work to do on it, but so far, I like it a lot.\r\n\r\nJen\r\n"

  body: "The designs are gorgeous, but there's a problem with the the integral forms
    and the flourish blending too much in the capitals. Consider your <strong>P</strong>,
    where the narrow verticals separate the body from the loop, or the <strong>J</strong>,
    whose lower curve sits up very high and looks very similar to a purely ornamental
    flourish used in other letters. \r\n\r\nAlso, be careful with the ornaments that
    you're putting into the counters of <strong>O</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>.
    As they're designed now, either one could be seen as a very ornamental <strong>P</strong>.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were you, I would print out a lot of foreign words using these and ask some
    non-designers to look at it and tell you which letters they have trouble recognizing.
    That would assist you in determining where the ornamentation is too over the top."

  body: "This looks pretty cool - and uncommon.\r\nBesides the legibility issue in
    some letters, I would caution that it will be hard to make this work for more
    than one letter at a time... Not impossible, just a good amount of work. Could
    we see some short text in it?\r\n\r\nBTW, was this derived from an existing font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    mess I'm afarid. It still only a vector design at the minute and waiting to go
    into production.\r\n\r\nI'll post some text shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would loose the swishy bits until you have your core forms worked out. Not
    because the the are not essential but instead because you may have too much on
    your hands trying to keep them intact while you modifying the forms to make them
    work better. Then afterwards you can make the swishes work to uniformly promote
    the usefulness of the font rather than sometimes helping & sometimes hurting it
    as they do now.

  body: "Nice job Werman! You forms, as Hrant sad, are a little uncommon what is preaty
    good. \r\n\r\nAlthough some characters like your \u201CX\u201D and \u201CP\u201D
    had a little different \"mood\" when compared with the other ones. Too much white
    into the counters spaces. Especially you X seems to be larger then other characters.
    May be you\u2019ll need to define some width\u2019s metrics and proportions to
    apply for all. Not to make characters identical, but to give some similar logic
    on the process. \r\n\r\nI think that you have a little different proposes between
    your lowercases and uppercases. The majuscules seems to be more geometrical and
    modular but you lowercases have a strong organic forms, have you already tried
    to equalize them? \r\n\r\nWhatever, I liked! It's a good start; make us up to
    date about it ok?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\ne.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for that elias. I'll do my best to update you but I'm currently working
    on two more fonts, so it may be a while. But I will post a.s.a.p\r\n\r\nAnyway
    thanks for taking th time to review it, it's most appreciated.\r\n\r\nI wanted
    something slightly different for the lowercase, away from the geometry of the
    uppercase.\r\n\r\nYeah all the widths will be ssorted when it finallt gets into
    Fontlab. The X was a tricky one, particaularly when trying to incorporate the
    swirl that features throughout. I was in two minds about whether or not to use
    the swirl for the bowl of the P or not, but I kind of like it.\r\n\r\nAgain thanks."

    has one problem with the design and that is the two thin bars merge when printed
    at 10pt\r\nSo it still needs a bit of work.\r\n"
