  and they have sent me their standard EULA. They have been very helpful but I just
  thought I would have a quick check as I don't know much about the subject and also
  feel a little snowed under by the amount of information out there!\r\n\r\nShould
  I use the font suppliers EULA?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nShould I try to create my own EULA?"

  body: "Hi Joe,\r\n\r\nI think this is a long discussion. By using the serch engine
    above you can find many topics about EULAs here in Typophile Forums. \r\n\r\nI
    particulary use the MyFont's standard EULA and I never had any problem.\r\n\r\nI
    think this is a matter of 'how do you want people using your fonts'. If you find
    anything that you do not agree or that you think it could be a little different
    in any standard EULA, I encourage you to modify that points before licensing your
    fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRicardo Esteves Gomes\r\nhttp://www.outrasfontes.com\r\n"

  body: Every EULA is a little different. It really depends upon what you want to
    do with your fonts and how you want (don't want) them used. I don't think I've
    read their EULA. A direct link to their EULA would be good so we can read it and
    comment specifically about it.

  body: "Ricardo\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback, its good to know you use Myfonts,
    as thats who I was planning to go with. They are very helpful whenever you contact
    them. I have had a look through their license and it does seem reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany\r\n\r\nI don't have any particular use for my font in mind, it is my first
    font to be released and is a bit of an experiment into commercial font design.
    Hopefully it will sell and therefore be worthwhile! Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
