body: If I'm making a large poster that has a few paragraphs of text that are meant
  to be readable from about three feet, how do I choose the point size and the leading
  such that it is legible and readable? It obviously depends on the typeface, but
  I just want a general guideline or a reference to an article or book about this.

    noticed that there's a lot of interesting stuff about typography in ergonomics
    textbooks.
