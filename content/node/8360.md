body: I&#39;m new to this forum and could use some help finding discussions on font
  management softwares for OS X. I found one Typophile discussion via Google, and
  then looked for more using the Search on this site, but got no results &#40;the
  IE windows logo/world kept spinning&#41;. My design group of 5 people currently
  uses Font Agent Pro 2.1 &#40;designing in the Adobe CS suite&#41; but am wondering
  if anything else is better. &#40;Suitcase X1? Master Juggler? Others?&#41; Thanks
  for any personal experience or advice you can provide.  <BR>Mary

    <BR> <BR>There have been several other threads discussing this question, with
    partisans from each of the programs claiming superiority for their chosen application.
    I think the only thing we&#39;ve agreed on is that Apple&#39;s Font Book isn&#39;t
    the answer. ;&#41;
