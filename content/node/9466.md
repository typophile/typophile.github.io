body: I can&#39;t find ANY on the web!  All of the outline fonts are transparent in
  the middle.  I really need it to be solid white with a black border - preferably
  something similar to arial. <BR> <BR>However, when I look up subtitling fonts, it
  only shows downloads for things like DVD creation programs and games. <BR> <BR>All
  I want to do is be able to add text quickly to my powerpoint presentations and have
  beautiful photos as the background. <BR> <BR>Is there any way I can download a font
  for my computer that is solid white with black outline?  Thanks! <BR> <BR>Also,
  I don&#39;t have Adobe.  I do have paintshop pro 7 - if I could create my own font
  with that limited program, I&#39;d do it.  TIA

  body: Fonts in their basic form are only one color. You simply need to take a regular
    font and give it a white fill with a black outline. See your Powerpoint or Paintshop
    documentation for more details.
