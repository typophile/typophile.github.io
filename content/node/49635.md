body: "[[http://forums.lakersground.net/|LakersGround]] is the premier online community
  for fans of the Los Angeles Lakers.  The current logo is getting long in the tooth
  so I've decided to whip up something new.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n-Purple & Gold as the
  primary color palette\r\n-Work equally well on dark and light backgrounds\r\n-A
  wide version (for the website header) and a stacked version for shirts, etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SEX2_4660.png]\r\n\r\nI
  like them all but only one of them can make the coveted website spot. Still I'd
  like to offer at least two as T-Shirt options (one of the versions with purple \"Lakers\"
  and one of the versions with gold \"Lakers\".)\r\n\r\nAny comments or critiques
  would be very appreciated. (Even from Celtics fans ;)"

  body: "I like the long horizontal designs the best. The first one I suppose. But
    it may not work on a white background.\r\n\r\nHave you tried making the stroke
    on the letters bigger?"

  body: The two font choices are too similar to contrast but different enough to feel
    wonky next to each other. I would stay with one or choose a second that provides
    true contrast. Otherwise, I like the oblique, lining versions for their suggested
    movement and ability to fill the top of a web page layout. But the stacked versions
    perhaps will offer a bit more versatility. Go Raptors!

    still need to decide which of the first two (Purple Lakers) and which one of the
    next three (Gold Lakers) I should go with. Black is probably the most important
    BG for them to look good on, white next, with gold and purple last."
