body: "Hello:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to help my client get her logo printed for a glass
  door. I've attached the logo here, and as you can see there are some very fine lines.\r\n\r\nShe
  wants the logo on the door, fairly small (about 5 inches wide), as it appears (no
  background, just the logo on the glass).\r\n\r\nI've approached one sign printer,
  who told me there's no way to print this unless it's on a solid background due to
  the fine lines. The only other option would be to significantly increase the thickness
  of the lines, is what I was told.\r\n\r\nMy instinct tells me this is true, but
  I just wanted to see if maybe someone knows of another solution. Maybe in the end,
  it has to be hand painted, or hand etched on the glass?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your help!"

  body: You could do this with cut vinyl. Find a company that does large format printing.
    They usually also work with vinyl. They can cut the letters and mount it direct
    to glass. The think linke and thin typeface might be a bit of a challenge.

  body: "The fine lines certainly would be a problem in both screen print and cut
    vinyl.\r\n\r\nI would have thought digital print would be OK, onto clear self
    adhesive vinyl, mirrored (particularly if you can find someone with a thermal
    printer).\r\n\r\nThe problem with cut vinyl is that however good the adhesive,
    there just isn't enough of it to stop lines that thin being moved around on the
    glass, assuming that you can plot and weed them sucessfuly in the first place.\r\n\r\nWith
    screen print (whether or not the lines are reversed out of a solid colour) you
    have the probability of rather unsightly \"saw-edging\" where the image in the
    stencil collides with the pattern of the mesh. You can't run the image parallel
    with the mesh because the mesh filaments close up the aperture in the stencil.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck\r\n\r\nRichard"
