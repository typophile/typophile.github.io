  body: "Hey, Christopher.\r\n\r\n1. Click on the entry's title.\r\n\r\n2. Just beneath
    the entry's title, in the black bar, click on \"Edit\".\r\n\r\n3. At the bottom
    of your entry, you will now see three buttons: the one on the far right is \"Delete\".\r\n\r\n4.
    Once you hit the \"Delete\" button, that should be it, but I've never used this
    feature before. :-)"
