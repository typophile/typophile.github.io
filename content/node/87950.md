  body: do the squint test. do any rivers run through?  if you pour water on the top,
    does it come through anywhere faster? In this case, not so much. One could try
    and cloe the s/y or the r/g a hair if they chose, but it's fine.

  body: 'forrest: Yes, I mean tighten, but pay attention. If you look at the letters
    as groups of three, you will see that every group sits quite well except the last
    one. Tighten the g/o but keep an eye out so that the group of "rgo" still sits
    well. If it doesn''t you might wan''t to tighten it a little bit less and add
    a little space between o/s.'

  body: "The rest you can play with to get more even, but my feeling is that the y
    is messing things up. The yn link now is distracting while the gap between the
    y and n is still too big compared to the other spaces. \r\n\r\nI think there is
    a problem with the drawing in the font. On the y, the top \"v\" should be more
    open, with the left diagonal moved to the left, and joining lower down on the
    thin stroke. Then I think it would space better with the other letters. \r\n\r\nIf
    this is a logo, then usually the best thing is to redraw letters to make them
    work better together, as Doyald Young shows in his Fonts and Logos. "
