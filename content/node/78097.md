    custom lettering.\r\nThe official term for this abstract blackletter style is
    \xABSchlichte Gotisch\xBB or \xABGebrochene Grotesk\xBB. \r\nThe other Schlichte
    Gotisch looks like Tannenberg (\xABFolge 34 / 26. August 1939\xBB)."

    normal width. The body text might be Neue Fraktur (which you can pick up on [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm|typOasis]]'

    know already that Tannenberg et al are, one might say, blackletter sans, like
    one can call News Gothic an antiqua sans -- a plain, simplified typeface.\r\n\r\nOur
    brains, I once read, are pattern-matching/-seeking devices. A look at the thick
    lines of Tannenberg Fett, specifically the T's stem, yields a match with a cavalry
    boot. Or the bottom end of a gutter drainpipe. Or a broken mallet."
