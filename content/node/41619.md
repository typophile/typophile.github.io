body: "Just wanted to ask the general opinion on the suitability of Avenir Next for
  body text. The text in question has lots of images with captions, footnotes and
  italics. The topic is design and the desire is to keep the appearance clean (images
  already have lots of text using various fonts in them), contemporary and \u201Cconstructivist\u201D.
  I thought I\u2019d also use Avenir for all titles. The primary worries are readability
  (I am happy with lots of leading and short lines) and the appearance of Italics
  which are not very contrasty. The results on a high-end digital printing machine,
  in colour (if that matters).\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. Also, if you can
  point to examples using Avenir in books or other long documents, I\u2019d be happy
  to see them.\r\n\r\nIf you can suggest better Sans alternatives for body text in
  books, please let me know too. Again, preferably with examples.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Avenir (and the Next-update of that) runs fairly wide, eg you don\u2019t
    get enough characters in a regular line. To do that you have to go to smaller
    sizes. \r\nThe strong horizontal bias of Avenir asks for more linespacing than
    regular.\r\nAlso to consider: it\u2019s a typeface with very little contrast.\r\n\r\nAltogether
    not a very efficient text face.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go the sans\u2019 route
    and want to stick to a Frutiger typeface, his namesake typeface Frutiger may be
    a better choice. That also has more variants, esp. a very good condensed. (BTW
    Frutiger Next has better italics than the original Frutiger.)\r\n\r\nIf you want
    that really old fashioned geometric look, try Akzidenz Grotesk. Or my latest favorite
    (and a very up-to-date take on that tradition): Kris Sowersby\u2019s National.\r\n\r\n.

  body: "bert_vanderveen\r\n\r\nThanks. My page size is A4 and the font size should
    be 11pt or thereabout. Am not sure I understand what you mean by \u201Cefficient\u201D
    and \u201Ccontrast\u201D here, sorry that I lack the lingo. I can decide on the
    line length and other parameters to make things look OK.\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    alternatives. I am not wedded to a Frutiger typeface. In fact, I am not sure I
    like his preference for oblique-like Italics, even in the better \u201Cnext\u201D
    generation. Kris Sowersby\u2019s National is a nice and fully-featured option
    it seems \u2013 I shall keep it in mind. I shall need old-style figures + sub-
    and superscript in the very least whatever I choose.\r\n\r\nI thought of Avenir
    because its look seemed to me compatible and unifying when set against the versatile
    architecture and design appearing in the images. If there are better sans alternatives
    out there, I\u2019d be glad to hear of them too. I tried some serifs also but
    their shapes always seem to clash with what the images do. The images are quite
    eclectic and in my mind, the body text should not side with any of the styles
    appearing there. Hence, it seemed that the geometric, minimalist approach would
    be the best. Maybe people with experience can suggest something else. I am very
    interested\u2026\r\n\r\nSihep\r\n\r\nThanks, I knew about Amsterdam and now had
    a look at the documents. Very helpful. But I see that they use Documenta for longer
    documents, perhaps confirming that Avenir is a bit too much on masse\u2026 I really
    was hoping to see it in a book somewhere."

  body: "Yes, the wisdom is that most geometric sans are quite inappropriate for extensive
    body text, such as in a book. I'd say the same for pretty much any flavor of sans
    other than humanist (and even that wouldn't be appropriate for, say, a novel,
    IMO).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks all. Well, this is not a novel. This is a design book but with lots
    of text. It needs to look serious but also visually balanced. Designs in the images
    are contemporary avant-garde - so the classic/historic-looking fonts are out,
    especially serifs (e.g., Garamond). I am not so sure about humanist sans. Or maybe
    I am yet to see the one that is simple and nice and seems suitable. Maybe DIN...?
    E.g., Kievit seems somewhat loosely drawn, of course only onscreen and in great
    magnification (I do not have it to experiment with).\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a
    more techy look though. What do you think of PFIsotext? Is that possible in your
    opinion or too hard to read? Or PFHandbook (this seems nice but rather dense and
    with  wonkish g's).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, what about some minimalist slab
    serif in humanist proportions? Would that be OK?\r\n\r\nAs you all are disapproving
    of my original intention, I\u2019d like to hear of possible alternatives."

    this may be hard to do and somewhat timeconsuming, but it\u2019s the way to go

  body: "It is true about sans and (esp. architectural and related) design books -
    they are all in sans. If they are not - they are likely historic or are about
    phenomenology and argue for the fundamental rightness of medieval-peasant life.
    Is the use of sans going to spread? I do not know. Nor am I in a position to judge.
    Where design is not supported by aggressive marketing, e.g., in architecture,
    non-designers prefer to like things of long ago. So, I am not surprised that people
    also prefer fonts of long ago. In this project, while it is necessary to make
    things readable, it is also important to make a statement on the value of the
    contemporary (or even technical)\u2026\r\n\r\nThe idea that book texts need to
    be perceptually transparent to give unobstructed access to underlying content
    seems to belong to an age of unchallenged rationalism now long-gone. If the act
    of reading is creative, challenging the reader to do work is OK. E.g, cf. Russian
    \u201Cfuturist\u201D designs.\r\n\r\nThis all is diverging from the title of the
