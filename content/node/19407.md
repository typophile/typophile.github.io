  'Shameless Self Promotion', but maybe worth a visit. 'The TypeDesign.eu Directory'
  is a project I recently started, collecting links to European type related sites.

  / find a site that should be in there, please let me know. Site submissions are
  more than welcome. :)</em><!--break-->"

    of the European Union. Isn't that what the .eu domain extension stands for, Hrant?"
