  font.  I found a freeware typeface that is very similar called Teacher&#39;s Pet,
  but it doesn&#39;t connect nicely the way this does.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/4861.gif"

    best small pixel script.  <BR>But that&#39;s not it either.

  body: Didn&#39;t find that font, but in searching for it I stumbled upon a <a href="http://bitmapmania.m78.com/">really
    nice collection</a> of diverse pixel fonts. Now I can actually see myself trying
    pixel fonts in a web design, whereas before I thought it was just a trend I was
    hoping would go away.

  body: You know what I just realized? Making an automatic bitmap font ID system should
    be possible, and not too hard. I mean once you&#39;ve compiled a database of bitmap
    fonts, or at least their distinctive glyphs. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Nice work, kemie. Yes, I can&#39;t help but suspect that Pixelyn <BR>was &#34;inspired&#34;
    by your work &#40;assuming Lilany was designed  <BR>after Lilabit.&#41;

    Can you post a link? Thanks.

  body: lilabit is not yet finished, sadly. I <BR> wouldnt assume any inspiration,
    stephen, as strong similarities are inevitable in bitmap/pixel fonts...
