body: I have chosen to redesign the Chrome Hearts logotype &#40;shown below&#41; for
  my logotype class. They are a very high end retail boutique &#40;only a few stores
  located througout the world&#41;, that specialize in leather and jewelry. I will
  be hand lettering the logotype, but I am looking for some modern gothic/blackletter
  typefaces for inspiration. Can anybody recommend some faces that I should look at
  before I take a stab at it? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/64596.gif"

    <BR>Mind you if you want to improve on it don&#39;t do it all uppercase.

    <BR>Sorry I didn&#39;t notice the modern requirement. This is a duoline &#40;I
    made that up&#41; take on Old English style blackletter.

  body: Oh yeah! Jeez, how could I forget to mention Joe Treacy&#39;s TF Greyletter,
    after going to so much effort to figure out what it was? If Wexford Oakley is
    a duoline, then TF Greyletter is a monoline. It&#39;s available in ten weights,
    and is my favorite recent take on blackletters. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/oneliner09.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.treacyfaces.com/oneliner09.html</a> <BR> <BR>If you
    prefer a fraktur to a textura, there&#39;s also Ingrimayne&#39;s PhrackSle, also
    a beautiful monoline blackletter. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/phracksle/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/phracksle/</a> <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    also Linotype&#39;s Auferstehung, which is still sort of monoline, albeit with
    a much, much chubbier stroke. It feels more like a traditional blackletter, but
    for whatever reason I don&#39;t like it as much. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/968/linotypeauferstehung-family.html"

    <BR> <BR>I like &#40;and own&#41; Gothic Gothic, but it&#39;s a very wide typeface,
    and would be challenging to set into the banner space you have available &#40;making
    it curve gracefully would be a challenge all its own&#41;. Of the more traditional
    blackletter faces, Brauhaus and American Text are probably your best bets for
    giving a more &#34;modern&#34; feel, although all-caps American Text is probably
    only good if Chrome Hearts&#39;s goal is to market bling to the urban hood set
    &#40;not that I have a problem with that&#41;. If CH&#39;s market is primarily
    Japanese &#40;as some Googling seems to indicate&#41;, then the wilder and less
    legible the logotype is, the more the kids in Harajuku will get into it. <BR>
    <BR>This looks like a fun project!
