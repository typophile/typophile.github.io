body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThe typeface i want to ID is used by Segafredo Zanetti Caf\xE9
  Portugal (on pub, posters and recently on sugar bags).\r\n\r\nAlthough my first
  thought was a mix of G-type's Precious Sans Thin + Houschka Thin, some glyphs seem
  rather unbalanced when compared to these 2 (specially the wide opened \"C\" the
  base of the \"e\" and the top of the \"a\". Other than that the \"f\" is a perfect
  match of Precious Sans Thin.\r\n\r\nAnyone knows this custom font/adaptation?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nadriano\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/segafredo_5059.jpg]"
