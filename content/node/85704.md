  copy of Windows on ebay, so that I can test my first font on it.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if any of you guys think it's necessary to test on both versions of the latest Windows
  systems. Half the people out there use 7, and half are using XP. Is there a difference
  in how they handle fonts, or what? I'm thinking about buying both and testing on
  both if I have to, but only if necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who
  knows."

  body: Sorry, I misread your post. Win 7 is fine. Turning off Cleartype, as gargoyle
    said, will give you the same rendering as default Win XP settings.

  body: Thanks guys, but I'm not concerned about how the font displays as long as
    it works okay. I just want to test it in various basic apps and see if there are
    any errors.
