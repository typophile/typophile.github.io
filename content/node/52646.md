    taking pot shots at you for posting a font ID request here. You may however get
    a better response if you post this in on the Type ID board.\r\n\r\nThe moderator
    who wrote General Posting Guidelines has left numerous errors in the text which
    are way overdue for correction. For example, images should be 595 pixels in width,
    not 600 pixels, to avoid scrollbars appearing. He should have corrected \"anything
    goes\" for General Discussions a long  time ago too. Evidently he and the other
    moderators and Typophile's site owners and operators don't care enuff about small
    but significant details like these that screw everybody else up.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    they are lazy, or maybe it's just apathy. Know only one thing---users are forced
    to complain and complain &nbsp;L O U D L Y&nbsp; before Punchcut or any of the
    moderators address these issues, let alone fix all the basic things users are
    tired of complaining about.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
