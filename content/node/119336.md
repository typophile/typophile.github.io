  Chianti as this is quite similar however to make our jobs look better I'm trying
  to find an exact match. this is used by 2/3 memorial masons in our area I seem to
  be the only one who does not know what this font is. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSteve."

    asking some of the other masons what it is?  \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
