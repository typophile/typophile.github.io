  magazines.  One has a cover that will have 50% UV spot varnish.  I'm not sure how
  to set this is in InDesign though.  Is there a swatch for a 5th color?  When I export
  the document to .pdf, will it be read separately?  \r\n\r\nI appreciate any help
  you guys can give.  \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Yeah, just add any spot color to the ID document where you want the varnish,
    and make sure when you're exporting the PDF that the spot color is there as a
    separate plate (it should be by default). Tell the printer that the spot color
    is where you want the varnish, and be sure to print b&w images of each of the
    5 plates (and write on the the spot plate that it's the varnish) so that there's
    no chance of confusion or miscommunication as the job goes through the hands of
    several folks at the printer.

  body: I tend to send it as a seperate file to make sure there's no confusion ..
    but if you're in close contact with the printer there shouldn't be a problem either
    way.

  body: "I usually make either a seperate page in the document (if it's a 1 page document,
    like a cover or something) with the spots where the varnish is supposed to go,
    and color those black. Or I make a seperate file for it. In both cases I specify
    clearly that that document or page is the varnish plate.\r\n"

  body: Maybe a bit old-fashioned, but if I am designing a UV I do two things. One
    is to have a separate spot color and name it Spot UV, but I also print the separations
    out so as to give the press a sample of the plates so they know that I know that
    they should know that there is indeed a spot UV color.
