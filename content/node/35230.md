body: "Does anybody know of a decent tool to edit how fonts are labeled (and consequently
  displayed in a program like Illustrator)?\r\n\r\nI am interested in reclassifying
  some fonts, so that (a) they show up under one family in a piece of software and
  (b) don't conflict with each other thus preventing a font manager like Suitcase
  Fusion from activating several weights at once.\r\n\r\nTo be very specific: I have
  a version of Scala Sans, where I can't activate the bold and roman at the same time.
  Upon closer inspection each of these fonts have the same \"Screen Font\" tag ...
  so Suitecase only keeps one open at a time. [sidenote: this might have happened
  when I converted my version of Scala into OpenType and programmed some ligatures
  in]\r\n\r\nDoes this require a full-blown editor like FontLab? I used it once to
  change some font attributes and found it's menu for that overblown and antiquated
  ... there seemed to be a dozen ways to do the same thing?\r\n\r\nIs anybody really
  good at this stuff? I can post screen grabs if that helps at all."
