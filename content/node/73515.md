body: "Cheers,\r\nI'm currently working on my first font family, using FontLab 5.
  Now I've got three weights so far (regular, italic, bold). However there is something
  that concerns me: I'm using MainType 2.1 for Windows for font management, and in
  the preview my Italic is shown at a much smaller font size than my other weights
  (about 1/3 to 1/4). It behaves normally in InDesign though. When I check other font
  families they are previewed more uniformly.\r\n\r\nI checked the key measurements
  but they are all the same. Is it probably connected with the Font BBox as these
  values are different? But I don't know how to change that. Or some rulers that are
  above the en square? Does anyone faced a similar problem before?"

  body: "The Font BBox or Bounding Box is the maximum dimension box for all glyphs
    in the font. When designing it is a good idea to decide on a maximum overall ascent/descent
    that none of the fonts in the family will exceed. That then can be the basis of
    your max Ascent/Descent for the whole family.\r\n\r\nIf you are using TrueType
    then the Vertical Device Metrics can also have an effect on how fonts are displayed
    by some applications, particularly in Windows.\r\n"

title: Different weights previewed at different heights even though Key Measurements
  are the same?
