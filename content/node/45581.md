  It has no real meaning...yet. I won't say much more, because I'd love to hear the
  communities thoughts based on the name alone.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    facie</em> ;-)\r\n- Foreignness of first word makes me question how to pronounce
    second: like English \"creative,\" or is it something like \"cray-ah-TEEV\"?\r\n\r\n"

  body: You also have the issue of, if someone reads it in a very literal American
    english style rather than fake Latin, it is "Stud Iam Creative". Unless you're
    focusing on design for  porn or animal husbandry, it's probably a bad idea to
    name your company with "stud" as the first syllable.

  body: "I wouldn't make a too big issue of that.\r\nMore and more people claim to
    be offended by perfectly normal terms such as \"assessment\" or \"analysis\".
    Now we should add \"studio\" to the list of banned words?\r\n\r\n.. Well, perhaps
    only in the US."

  body: "No, not studio, but a fake word like \"studeum\" that has no real English
    pronunciation (only a fake Latin one) is pretty easy to be read the wrong way.\r\n\r\nA
    \"studeum\" sounds like an arena with all-nude oil wrestling. No naming company
    in a million years would let you get away with it, for good reason.\r\n\r\nDon't
    forget the lesson we learned in the past decade about how a very clear name can
    get pronounced in unfortunate and unprofessional ways when it goes beyond the
    controlled environment of a business card and letterhead.\r\n\r\nA consulting
    company called \"the Experts Exchange\" sounds reliable, but if you go to www.expertsexchange.com,
    you might expect to be sold hormone supplements and saline implants, not advice
    on tax shelters. A few spaces can mean the difference between professional respect
    and being the butt of dirty jokes. Nobody is going to hire the Expert Sex Change
    people to revamp their accounting system, regardless of their qualifications or
    references.\r\n\r\nAs people who often work with identities, this is the sort
    of worst-case scenario we're supposed to be looking for and trying to avoid as
    part of our responsibility to clients. Even putting a harmless name into foreign
    dictionaries just to make sure it doesn't mean something horrible in Turkish or
    Swahili is standard procedure. I mean, I don't want to be the marketing guy in
    Finland who has to explain to my boss what Jussipussi means in English and why
    it was a bad brand name for our bread."

  body: "my thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nLatin is an old, dead language.  when used, to
    me at least, it invokes an association with the roman empire and simpler times.
    \ I think some of the most beautiful poetry was written in latin, and I'm reminded
    of conquerors and poets.\r\n\r\nGraphic design is a relatively new thing.  Not
    too long ago it was called 'graphic arts' and has been called 'corporate arts'
    before that.  To me, taking a modern job and concept and applying it to an antiquated
    language is an anachronism.  Out of place in time.\r\n\r\nIt's like painting the
    mona lisa with an iPod and trying to pass it off as valid.  I mean yeah, everyb'dy's
    got an iPod, and yes, the Mona Lisa was a woman, so by that logic she must have
    had one right?\r\n\r\nI think the first time guilds of artists (sculptors, painters
    and the like) appeared on the scene would be likely in italy.  Check out Florentian
    and Venetian art history (which you should know anyway) and you'll see how the
    guild system worked.\r\n\r\nMaybe, it's a stretch for sure, but maybe the language
    that would best suit this would be italian, but because there are still italians
    running around today, all of the non-italians will likely assume you're italian
    and operate your business in that language as well.  Or else italians will incessantly
    talk to you in italian because you have an italian name.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe other
    languages as fun as they are sometimes, don't suit our industry as well as they
    would other fields.\r\n\r\nFor advice on a creative name, I'd start with this:
    \ how many people are in your studio?  If it's just you, use your name, make it
    a beautiful, classy, elegant design and use your name.  If you're John Anderson,
    you could use Anderson design, and even if you hire 50 people, the name still
    works, where 'John Anderson design' begins to break down."
