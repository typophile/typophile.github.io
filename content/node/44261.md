body: "Hi there Typophiles!\r\n\r\nThis is a type I've been working on lately. It's
  a somewhat \"mechanic\" approach to a very analogue technique used mostly on sales
  posters in shop windows. Im looking for critique/suggestions on the basic design.
  I know there are many flaws and some bad spacing, but this is only the first draft.
  I'll post the whole alphabet in one or two weights later if wanted.\r\nWhat do you
  think? Is there a place for a type like this? \r\nAll suggestions are welcome.\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/rea_pres.pdf|sample.pdf]]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4462.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian\r\n"

    the design of characters for a 'handwritten' set, but just to let you know I really
    bloody like it, especially the 'Ultra' weight. Have you created the characters
    on calligraphic foundations?\r\n\r\nProper nice imo.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nRez\r\n"

  body: I sort of miss the feeling of some kind of hand movements in the typeface.
    But if you work more on that, it could be a nice one.
