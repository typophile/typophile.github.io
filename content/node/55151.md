body: "This was from a thread about a serifed match for Avant Garde, but I think it's
  a relevant question on its own:\r\n\r\nIs there a such thing as a geometric oldstyle?
  \r\n\r\nOf course, we have examples like Albers, etc., but oldstyles are typically
  associated with their humanist touch. What about a geometric oldstyle with less
  of the humanism and more of the geometry, but without the increases in contrast
  associated with the move away from humanism and into rationalism and the engraving
  tool?\r\n\r\nDon't think of it as Futura with serifs (shudder), but think of it
  as an oldstyle typeface with the same skeletal structure as Futura or Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nIf
  this typeface existed, what would it look like? I have a picture in my head, but
  not enough time to rough up an idea."

    is pretty much a slab serif version of Avant Garde. I wouldn''t call it old style
    though.'

    Antiqua? An interesting typeface, but definitely not the idea. I do like Kabel
    though.\r\n\r\nThink Mendoza, but more geometric."

    what I want. It's maybe not as geometric as I was thinking, but the softness and
    contrast are just right.\r\n\r\nThink of that, with the skeletal structure of
    Futura, and I think that would be the ticket."
