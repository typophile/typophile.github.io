  be all text so I want to use an interesting font . . . professional, science-y,
  but not boring and will still look good with the web fonts used througout the rest
  of the site.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the theme I will use for the new website:\r\nhttp://organicthemes.com/demo/portfolio-gray/\r\n "

    will look like with the them I am using.\r\n\r\nWith this theme, I will be using
    the selected font in the header and down below in the small pictures.  For the
    rest of the headings and body text, I will need to select a complimentary websafe
    font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geogrotesque_6055.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/klavika_6142.jpg]"

  body: In that case, don't forget about <a href="http://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/">Titillium</a>.
    At least give it a try, it's free after all.

  body: "Hmmm - Titillium is nice but I am almost leaning towards a typewriter type
    font.  \r\nSomething as simple as [[http://www.jabroo.com/index/search/q/american+typewriteramerican

    As I understand it, they are gratis/free for non-commercial use.
