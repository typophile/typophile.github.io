  caused much more of a stir than I intended it to and in fairness to the original
  designers, I have now removed the entries until the final winner is picked. Initial
  post is below...\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWe have run a competition for a logo design recently,
  and although we kind of like the logos attached, we are not certain how well they
  will scale for other parts of our design. Many of the entrants have utilised popular
  design fonts, which I can integrate into the current design (navigation etc.) to
  see how it feels overall. This particular font though, I cannot pin point, even
  though a few contestants have utilised it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is the main
  logo font, which is a sans-serif. I have narrowed it down to Pacific Sans and Normandy
  Isle JNL via the 'what the font' website, but I could be missing a more popular/standard
  typeface.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Sorry, have edited initial post to clear it up. We can't ask contestants
    during the competition as it is not fair to them all - could get their hopes up
    for nothing and they would probably not want to divulge the information because
    they then think you could make your own.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 or 5 utilised the main
    font identified above, they just all created their own spin on the badge/stamp.
    Again for the scripts, we are not sure if these would look right/be readable for
    smaller sub headings, so we would still like to identify the fonts if possible."

    asking the person who designed it what font he used is so that you don't owe them
    anything. Except you do. And the thing is, this discussion here is all public...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Brush]]</strong>\r\nbut I'm not convinced too by your reasoning on why you don't
    ask the original designers.\r\nIf asking them directly would have raised suspicions
    that you could make your own,\r\nasking to id the fonts in a public site like
    typophile without their knowledge is even worst.\r\n"

  body: "Ok I take your points seriously that this is a public discussion and so will
    remove the images above until we pick the winner. The competition is closed for
    entries (and has been before I posted first), we just have to pick a final winner
    - we aren't allowed to pick more than one and we are not allowed to contact designers
    direct whilst the competition doesn't have a winner. Yes, I tried yesterday after
    your comments above.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind we needed to find a logo and typeface
    that would fit in with the overall aesthetic of the website, future branding (such
    as business cards etc) and how it would look utilised in certain accent sections
    of the site. \r\n\r\nI was trying to ID certain fonts because I like them and
    wanted to see how they would look in this context. Other who have utilised standard
    fonts I can already do this with - and if I wanted to copy their logos I could
    quite easily do that. As I have pointed out though, we have guaranteed a winner
    and we would never rip someone else's design off. I just want to make sure I pick
    the correct one - and not just because I don't know the font they used.\r\n\r\nThe
    worst thing is, these designs aren't even in our top 3 at the moment, there are
    many others who have utilised the same font with different takes on the badge/stamp
    that were much better. I really did just like the fonts and wanted to try them.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    many thanks for helping out for those that did."

  body: "Thank you for the find of the main font DPape.\r\n\r\n@hrant - The competition
    is closed and we have guaranteed a winner. I did not mention this in the initial
    post due to this very reason - I didn't want it to come across as though we would
    try and replicate it on our own. \r\n\r\nThe main reason we are trying to locate
    the font is because we like it but are not quite sure it would work scaled larger/smaller
    for navigation use,  etc.  Most of the other entries utilise common typefaces
    (trajan pro, century, gills sans, itc franklin gothic pro), of which I can already
    test how they would work in the new design, but I had no idea what this was as
    I had never seen it before.\r\n\r\nWe are just making sure we do everything possible
    beforehand to pick the right one for use across the site. It would probably be
    worse if we picked one of these as the winner and then didn't use it! \r\n\r\nWe
    would never try and re-create or claim work as our own, it would be stupid of
    us to do so since we promoted the initial competition on our very own site and
    have showcased a gallery of submissions to our audience already for their vote
    on what they like best.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has ideas on the script fonts then please
    let me know."
