  book last year for our type specimen book\r\nthis book is HILARIOUS! the letters
  are awesome and i am so glad i bought it!\r\nthe title says it all....Other People's
  Love Letters: 150 Letters You Were Never Meant to See!\r\ni think the hand-written
  look works really well for the cover, since all the letters in the book were scanned
  in. it ties in the overall theme really well. and i really dig the papers pouring
  our to the closed suitcase...makes me wanna open it! and you do when you flip it
  open!\r\nit really is a fun flip-thru-and-read kind of book...i love it! makes me
  feel happy when i am sad!"
