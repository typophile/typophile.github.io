  body: "Do any of you old-timers remember a page from <em>u&lc</em> from perhaps
    the mid-70s that showed an entire alphabet made from identical pretzels bitten
    off in particular ways? \r\n\r\nAs I recall the story, an art director was watching
    the telly with his family, bit off a couple of pretzels and remarked on how well
    they seemed to work as letters. After that the whole family pitched in on the
    project. The alphabet was even accompanied with a full complement of numerals
    and punctuation. (no old style figs, though!)\r\n\r\nI have a copy slide of that
    page because I used to include in my lectures for a bit of levity. If I can hunt
    it up I'll post it."
