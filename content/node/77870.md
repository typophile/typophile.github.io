  body: "It's nice. From what I recall it's better than any of the options you posted
    in the previous thread some time ago.\r\n\r\nFor the 'EST. 1991' line I would
    loosen the tracking a bit and perhaps switch to small caps / old style numbers.
    Also, since there's such a large wordspace between 'EST. 1991', the space between
    'F.D.' and 'STIL' looks rather small."

- body: 'I agree with penn, and I''d add that the text is optically off-center. It
    might me mechanically correct, but because of the L being so open, it needs to
    shift to the right to look correct. '

  body: I like the suggestion of the monogram/ chandelier in the top left image. Maybe
    put the Est. 1991 in sans serif small caps?

  body: It's a great look overall - especially the top right one without the oversharpened
    corners. Besides the mentioned kerning/optical center issues my one question would
    be as to the necessity of the "est. 1991" line at all - it just gives off a cheap
    impression on what otherwise would be a very classy logo.
