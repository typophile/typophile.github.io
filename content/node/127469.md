  Cymbria and Blanch? We need to purchase a commercial license for these fonts, but
  they don't seem to be available. It appears that Blanch might have a license available
  through LostType, but I am not certain at this point that the EULA is sufficient
  for our needs.\r\n\r\nCymbria:\r\nhttps://www.fontforestry.com/cymbria\r\n\r\nBlanch:\r\nhttps://www.losttype.com/font/?name=blanch\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any assistance you can provide.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "Josh, Lost Type's commercial license is rather broad:\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/images/samples/License_Commercial_Sample.pdf\r\nhttps://www.losttype.com/contact/\r\n\r\nAs
    for Cymbria, it is posted as a free font for both personal and commercial use
    (see the header text on the Font Forestry's Freebies page):\r\nhttps://www.fontforestry.com/freebies-1/\r\n\r\nIf
    you go to Font Forestry's commercial fonts page and click through the purchase
    links (to Creative Market), the license states that those fonts are may be used
    for \"Commercial Use; Unlimited Number of Projects; Unlimited End Products For
    Sale\". I suspect their freebie fonts share the same permissions. Contact them
    if you are unsure about how you intend to use them:\r\nhttps://www.fontforestry.com/contact-1/"
