    the account for Hyundai's former AOR/Digital). \r\n\r\nCouldn't find a match to
    this anywhere. Pluto Sans seems to be the best match for the proportions of the

  body: "Good digging Kevin. I found no matches for the odd combination of an asymmetrical
    round top _A_ and squared _U_ with box interior. I knew the curve on the Hyundai
    _A_ was too boxy, but since I missed the matching _A_ in Rusty, I used Hyundai's
    _A_ to poke the discussion forward.\r\nI was hoping someone would find some options
    for the the capital letters beyond ALUMA. Your collection is indeed helpful for
    making the decisions that needed to produce these \"squaring the circle\" letters.
    One possibility is to use Purista Bold as the default for letter proportions and
    adjust with ideas from other fonts: including widening the _M_ so that it would
    be somewhere between the width in Purista and Pluto; using the _A_ in Rusty; and
    perhaps the S from Pluto.\r\nPerhaps ALUMA would be less conflicted and have more
    impact if the _U_ was a flipped _A_ without the crossbar. Which raises the possibility
    of making _N_ using a mirrored _A_ without the crossbar. And so forth.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "As for the last part about flipping and mirroring _A_ to make other letters,
    I know that they would end up looking somewhat similar to several letters in the
    lowercase of Handel Gothic. It's probably not a good idea to flood this alphabet
    with various other letterforms from Handel Gothic. The Hyundai logo reads well,
    in my opinion because the Handel Gothic style  _A_, _U_ and _N_ are contrasted
    with a standard _Y_.\r\nMight be interesting to make a modified ALUMA into a font.\r\nDon"
