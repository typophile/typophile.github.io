  It's for an organization who collects toiletries for less fortunate folks who can't
  afford them. The homeless more likely. I'm pretty close to finalizing but can't
  decide on the following font weights. Your feedback is much appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/7331_Soap4Hope_logo4_6027.jpg]"

  body: Swiss cheese? Bullet holes? The logo says "soap"! Good enough for me, conceptually.
    I think you could work on the letterspacing to make everything more compact and
    tighter. Also, look at this thing small so you get an idea how the bubble highlights
    will reproduce. I also think you're missing an opportunity to make one of the
    letter counters a bubble.

    I wouldn't want the letterspacing to be perfect or symmetric--the bubbles aren't,

  body: "These particular words offer a very tight lockup. Soap sitting on Hope leaves
    a nice little rectangle of space between to insert \"FOR\". Against that solid
    backdrop, the bubbles ought to read nicely. Bolder typeface is better, but feels
    tired. I agree, something round, but maybe with overstuffed curves - something
    like Cadena Black (http://latinotype.com/espanol/fonts/CadenaBlack/). \r\n\r\nAnother
    idea would be to minimize the number of soap bubbles to the bottom mask, and inside
    the counters of o's and maybe p. Using a geometric sans, the bubbles could be
    slightly off center in the counter.\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, good name for a good cause.
    Nice project!"

  body: What made the bubbles look like bulletholes for me in the first post was probably
    not really the lack of shading (though it is an improvement), but their small
    size. Ofcourse I realise that it could disturb legibility, but I'd try making
    them a little bigger.

    like small arcs with constant width. '
