  IN FONTLAB STUDIO 5.0.\r\nI HAVE ADDED A GLYPH TO A FONT OF ARABIC  . IT IS A NEW
  CHARACTER AND UNICODE HAS INCLUDED IT IN ARABIC SCRIPT IN 2012.IT IS A DUAL- JOINING
  GLYPH . I HAVE ENCODED IT AND GIVEN IT PROPER NAME . BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO SET
  ITS JOINING TYPE.IT IS EXPECTED TO  JOIN WITH OTHER CHARACTERS IN A   WORD AND SUBSTITUTE
  ITS MEDIAL FORM IN MEDIAL POSITION.BUT IT DOES NOT JOIN WITH OTHER CHARACTERS AND
  REMAINS IN AN ISOLATED FORM.THAT MEANS ITS CURRENT JOINING TYPE IS U (NON -JOINING)."
