body: OK, I&#39;m convinced that exclusivity would be a good idea. For one, it avoids
  having to discuss the side issue of why we want a separate grouping. &#34;Because
  we do&#34; is as good an answer as I&#39;m willing to give a lot of folks. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m thinking we need to have T-shirts with our individual names on the back,
  except replacing the occasional vowel with a strategic &#34;y&#34; -- right, Dyana?
  <BR> <BR>I find it interesting that in that nearly 30 years I got my first job as
  a &#40;cold&#41; typesetter, the majority of my colleagues have been female. I suspect
  the opposite was true when hot metal was the standard. I&#39;m thinking the gender
  issue in our field is quite an interesting topic.

    of the reason why dyane, tiff &#43; i were considering this idea is because we
    wanted a place for just us to talk - and not discussions focused on disssing you

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it has to be about anyone else learning, Hrant. I think
    &#40;and y&#39;all can correct me if I&#39;m wrong&#41; it&#39;s about having
    their own place to discuss what they want to discuss. Tiff, Dyana, Kristin, Shelley,
    you gals should do whatever the hell you want -- open or not open -- without caring
    a whit what Hrant or I or anyone else thinks. &#40;I guess this includes that
    remark, too -- whatever.&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, in the course of my research I was
    impressed to find, among the unsung heros of the MLCo. drawing office whose names
    appear in the title blocks of the working drawings, a Ms. Dorothy Arbogast working
    on the Caledonia Italic drawings in 1937. If memory serves, that&#39;s well before
    the widespread migration of women into the American workforce that occurred later
    during the war years. I thought that was cool. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Although I think this can be largely counteracted through good promotion,
    you&#39;ve made me realize something related: it&#39;s not enough to declare existence
    - some people join a list based on the quality of its content, sometimes even
    to reply to a specific post they simply <i>can&#39;t</i> let slide. These people
    won&#39;t join if they don&#39;t see what&#39;s inside first &#40;especially if
    they have to <i>pay</i>&#41;. <BR> <BR>For example, from what I understand ATypI
    gained members as a result of opening up the list to non-members. Actually, this
    has currently been suspended, but only because of a legal situation. And for the
    month of August the list will be opened up again - but possibly only to discuss
    a specific issue, the Code Morale. More on this soon. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thought #1: It is free. The registration to which I referred was mostly teasing
    Shelley, as she is still unregistered. <BR> <BR>Thought #2: Typophile is mostly
    a boys club. Not out of the doing from Joe or Jared. It is open to the girls,
    that is true, but I think for the most part girls don&#39;t want to deal with
    the confrontational nature of some of the members here. I&#39;m attempting to
    bring them to typophile through the back door. <BR> <BR>Thought #3. If it were
    to be read by the boys, what would stop you from criticizing our discussion in
    the main hall? As Jon and Kent have mentioned, if anything starts in Alphabetty
    that I think needs public discussion, I&#39;ll do that. <BR> <BR>Thought #4. This
    was offered to myself by Jared and Joe. If they felt is was using resources they
    wouldn&#39;t have offered. <BR> <BR>Thought #5. I&#39;m not the one launching
    an atmosphere of antagonism. <BR> <BR>Thought #6. I think you, Hrant, are the
    only one threatened by the idea of us girls having our own little room. <BR> <BR>Thought
    #7. At TypeCon there was great interest in the idea of the Alphabetty. Yes I will
    have to do some promotion. But in between the few that do want to participate,
    I&#39;m sure we can drum up enough interest. However, should it fall on deaf ears
    so be it. But we won&#39;t know without trying. So please don&#39;t yank the bud
    until it&#39;s bloomed. <BR> <BR>Thought #8. Just because I am starting the Alphabetty
    forum, don&#39;t think you&#39;ll see me disappear. <BR> <BR>So. How many of you
    boys are against this idea? And what about the girls? Just post FOR or AGAINST.

  body: I can understand having different interest groups based on some sort of relationship
    to the typographic community, such as a student group, an independent foundry
    group, a group mainly interested in revivals, or blackletter, or whatever.  <BR>
    <BR>I can also understand why people may want to have geographic-based groupings
    too - that certainly makes sense from a social, cultural and typographic standpoint
    too. <BR> <BR>However, I do not see why there would be a particular need for a
    form of <i>membership</i> that is based on gender, or sexuality, or race, or religion,
    or any other grouping that does not in any significant or meaningful way relate
    to the subject matter at hand - that of typography. <BR> <BR>I certainly do not
    wish to cause offense &#40;indeed the post was meant to be tongue in cheek, referring
    to my own particular little minority that is faaarrr smaller I suspect&#41;, neither
    would I want to stop it happening, but this is an open forum, and do I wish to
    remain silent on issues and events within the community merely for fear of contradicting
    others.  <BR> <BR>That said, if anyone found the ghetto reference offensive, please

  body: '&#62; girls don&#39;t want to deal with the confrontational nature of some
    of the members here. <BR> <BR>Yes, this is a classic phenomenon - not restricted
    to Typophile. I think Kent referred to this early on. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s
    a huge difference between limiting participation to foster a certain class of
    discussion versus limiting exposure to... what? The type of discussion that&#39;s
    confrontational &#40;!&#41; enough to be a <i>social</i> problem is unlikely to
    be typographically relevant. And again, there&#39;s always private email. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; what would stop you from criticizing our discussion in the main hall?
    <BR> <BR>Proper decorum. In my 5&#43; years on-line I&#39;ve rarely seen such
    a thing happen, and when it does people generally strike it down. Or you could
    ask the listmoms to remove offending posts - I&#39;m a big fan of judicious censorship.
    <BR> <BR>Or: <BR> <BR>&#62; Trust <BR> <BR>But obviously not enough of it to let
    non-females simply listen in... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t feel threatened - people
    use private email to bag on men &#40;and me&#41; all the time - it&#39;s natural,
    and I wouldn&#39;t want to stop it, or even read it. I just feel sad that you
    want to hide, instead of letting the world benefit from your insight. And I can&#39;t

  body: FOR or AGAINST. <BR> <BR>I think David has a valid point. I don&#39;t like
    the idea of breaking up into groups that focus on our differences. <BR> <BR>If
    one group feels isolated, then a focused group may be an acceptable means of integration;
    so long as there were plans to actually <i>integrate</i>, instead of just permanent
    plans to segregate. <BR> <BR>Perhaps a solution would be including in the plans
    a phase out of the seperate group once female participation has reached a predetermined
    level. And a caveat to dissolve the group if it doesn&#39;t achieve it&#39;s designed
    purpose - to make women feel welcome here - so that the group just doesn&#39;t
    perpetuate in segregation indefinitely.  <BR> <BR>So, if you decide to pursue
    this vein, just make sure that women do become an actual part of the community
    through this and not just an annex to it.
