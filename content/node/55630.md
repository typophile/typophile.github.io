body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nI'm an English Canadian designer working with a French Canadian
  designer on a project that involves both English and French typography. I've read
  a number of Forums that touch on the issue of \"air\" around punctuation in French
  typesetting. As my French is poor, I'm wondering what refinements are encouraged
  in French typography with specific regard to superscripts for footnotes, as well
  as punctuation in general. Should the Superscripts be set before, on top of or after
  punctuation? I've attached some samples that point to a specific style, but are
  these styles correct? And if so, which one is best suited to book typography?  I
  am a proponent of TEOTS, and yet Bringhurst hardly touches on the subject. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Different countries speaking French may have different rules, but in France
    it's generally the Imprimerie Nationale's rules which are followed. In the <em>Lexique
    des r\xE8gles typographiques</em> (1990) p. 25, the rules given are that footnote
    calls are preceded by a thin, unbreakable space and that the footnote calls always
    precede punctuation, including guillemets when citing material.\r\n\r\nThe examples
    given are :\r\n\r\nVeuillez agr\xE9er \xB9... (thin space before the footnote
    call)\r\n\r\n.. le nom attribut\xE9 \xE0 une rue, \xE0 un \xE9tablissement, etc.\xB9.
    (no space after or before)\r\n\r\nChateaubriand l'appelle \xAB le grand expiateur
    \xB9 \xBB (thin space before and after the footnote call)"

  body: "Thanks Philippe, I really appreciate the clarification. (I'm going to search
    out the text that you've mentioned.) \r\n\r\nHere's a link to the Province of
    Quebec's official online style guide: http://66.46.185.79/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?id=3253;
    they seem to support your recommendations. \r\n\r\nHere's an excerpt from Bringhurst's
    The Elements of Typographic Style, one where he discusses a number of approaches
    to the handling of guillemets, some of which conflict with the above.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an excerpt from the Chicago Manual of Style, one in which they suggest a slightly
    different approach. \r\n\r\nWhat to make of all this? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrenchSuperscripts_Bringhurst_5563.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrenchSuperscripts_ChicagoManual_1_5435.jpg]"

  body: "What's troubling you exactly with what Bringhurst says?\r\n\r\nThe Chicago
    example is interesting. By putting the footnote call after the guillemets, it
    shows that the reference concerns the whole \"A vrai dire, ...\" and not only
    the last citation \xAB Vois combien ... \xBB within it.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention
    it last time, but an interesting online resource about french (ortho)typography
    is Jean-Pierre Lacroux, <em>Orthotypo</em>, available at http://listetypo.free.fr/JPL/Orthotypo-Lacroux.pdf"
