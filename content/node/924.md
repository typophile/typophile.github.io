body: When I save a FOG-file &#40;by simply hitting save&#41;, my stoopid PC saves
  the information in a brand new temp-file. And when I hit save again, it creates
  a new temp-file again. And before you know it, you sit there with ten different
  temp-files and you have to delete them yourself. It doesn&#39;t save into the actual
  &#34;TheFont.fog&#34;-file. <BR>Does anyone know why this happen?

    <BR> <BR>Try saving the file to something with a short &#40;8.3&#41; name like
    C:\fonts\myfont1.fog '

  body: I think Fog can handle long file names OK, but it can&#39;t handle long <i>paths</i>.
    <BR>BTW, I don&#39;t have much experience with Fog in XP, but apparently, it doesn&#39;t
    seem to work properly, 100%. Maybe you should keep a Win98 machine for it, like
    some Mac people that run an OS9 machine just for Fog.

  body: OK, I will try to use 8.3 DOS standard &#34;KNALLERT.FOG&#34;. what if that
    doesn&#39;t do the trick? Switch to Win98?! I don&#39;t want to...
