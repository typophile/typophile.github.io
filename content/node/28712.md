  body: "The firm of Laurent & Deberny derives from the foundry of Gill\xE9. Alexandre
    de Berny bought out the foundry of his partner Laurent in 1840, and ran a business
    as Laurent & Deberny, or Deberny & Cie. In 1923 the foundry was merged with that
    of Georges Peignot and his son Charles, forming Deberny & Peignot. <cite>Specimen
    des Divers Types de la Fonderie Laurent et Deberny</cite> is a hard to get type
    specimen from that time. You could check out Fonthaus.com for fonts that might
    be similar to what you are looking for.."

  body: "Yes, I know that, of course ;-) My question was just whether or not this
    Deberny was the Deberny that later became the Deberny in Deberny et Peignot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
    are very few Deberny et Peignot typefaces available in digital format. Auriol,
    Cochin/Nicolas Cochin, Peignot, and BiFur come to minda, as well as almost all
    of the typefaces that Adrian Frutiger drew for them (especially Univers!). Otherwise,
    it can be tricky."

    Peignot). On his death, his son Georges Peignot took it over. Georges\u2019 son
    Charles took it over when Georges and his three brothers were all killed in the
    First World War. It became Deberny & Peignot in 1923 when the Laurent & Deberny
    foundry was purchased. From then until c1960 Charles Peignot directed the creation
    of a series of truly original designs. Starting in the late fifties, the company
    prepared the fonts for Lumitype, European Photon. In the sixties, Charles Peignot
    invested heavily in Lumitype, which used up some of the money to buy control of
    Deberny & Peignot, and let Charles go. It was closed in 1979, at which time the
    designs passed to Haas.\"\r\n\r\nFurther Details\r\nDeberny & Peignot\r\n18 rue

    with the liquidation of D. Stempel AG, Stempel's shares in the Haas\u2019sche
    foundry were acquired by Linotype (see http://www.linotype.com/49-14026/1973-1989.html).\r\n\r\nThere
    is an article about the history of Deberny et Peignot in the most recent version
    of the Linotype Matrix, which was written by John D. Berry (http://www.linotype.com/2720/linotypematrixvol4no2.html).\r\n\r\nMost
    of what typefaces from Deberny et Peignot there are to be found in digital format
    are in the Linotype Library (http://www.linotype.com).\r\n\r\nThe biggest exception
    that comes to mind is BiFur, of which P22 has a version (http://www.p22.com/ihof/bifurset.html)."

    that they are more than likely copperplate engravings (or woodcut, I've seen some

    produced in a way that could be reproduced. I'd be interested in more history

    stationary, notes, bonds, certificates, etc.  While in the back room, I notices
    stacks of old litho stones in the corner. On the stones were the most beautifully
    done scripts and ornaments.  Each stone was a blank for a particular bank note.
    \ They used to be inked and pulled in the traditional art printmaker style for
    years! I was young and stupid and did not have a camera (or a huge truck to carry
    the hundred pound stones) or I would have asked to keep some of them. Someone
    must have labored hours by hand crafting each letter.  They sure looked better
    than todays, \"Grab some clip-art and throw some Arial at it\" kind of stuff.
