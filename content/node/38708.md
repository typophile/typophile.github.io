  in late November and I was wondering if somebody could help me with site propositions
  (typography related of course), anything from bookstores to cemeteries. All suggestions
  will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKTKM\r\n"

    at Staalstraat 13a. You can also go and visit Ewald Spieker (just around the corner
    from the bookshop) at his Typogallery (if he is in). A very kind man who always
    has time for a chat.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMark\r\n"
