    I must say I was overwhelmed when I got it. It&#39;s loaded with practical information
    and advice.  <BR> <BR>The closest thing I&#39;ve seen was the book on electronic
    typography and type that Verbum published in the early &#39;90s. I don&#39;t have
    it handy for the actual title &#40;I&#39;m away from my office this week&#41;.
    But Leslie&#39;s book is much better in terms of content &#40;and more up-to-date,
    of course&#41;.

    probably happen this weekend. So I&#39;ll put a link to it here.  <BR> <BR>So
    far I have to say it is very informative, specially for beginner/intermediate
    level designers &#40;no offense!&#41;. It has a lot of great tips, shows by example
    which is a big plus and is quite humorous. The best part of it is the type tricks
    for Illustrator, lots of handy, verging-on-the-kitschy-if-applied-wrong type effects.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d say it is a very good addition to any type fiend&#39;s library.

    a real change of pace from the much drier books that tend to populate related
    spaces &#40;though I think there are no books that cover this exact space&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>That being said, some of the same qualities that make it great fun seem
    to make it more of a browse and read-chunks-of book rather than a reference work,
    for me. <BR> <BR>My only very small complaint is that Leslie does readers a bit
    of a disservice by saying that &#34;glyph&#34; is just the trendy new term for
    &#34;character.&#34; The difference is critical in understanding font-building
    and text processing for complex languages &#40;e.g. Arabic&#41; and for advanced
    typography in general &#40;e.g. OpenType, AAT, Graphite, whatever&#41;. But that&#39;s
    just one little thing in a generally outstanding book. Guess we&#39;ll just have
    to look ahead to the FontLab book to see glyph vs. character covered better, or
    I&#39;ll have to write my own.... <BR> <BR>Speaking of the many cool tidbits,

    <BR> <BR>Leslie, please do not alternate glyph and character, they are <i>not</i>
    synonymous terms in digital typography. The distinction of character &#40;semantic
    encoded text entity&#41; and glyph &#40;conventional representation of character&#41;
    is extremely important in making sense of the relationship between text processing
    &#40;input, editing, storage, exchange&#41; and text display &#40;rendering, typographic
    layout, etc.&#41;. If you confuse these two terms, you leave yourself without
    a meaningful vocabulary for discussing this relationship. The fact that the relationship
    of character to glyph is not one-to-one makes it particularly important that the
    distinction is maintained. <BR> <BR>You may find my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/opentype/default.htm">article</a>
    on OpenType Layout useful in understanding the distinction between and relationship
    of characters and glyphs.

  body: 'To put it really simply &#40;and not perfectly accurately&#41;, A glyph is
    a letter drawing, and a character is a specific encoding slot. In a font, a given
    character &#40;slot&#41; has a default glyph &#40;outline&#41; associated with
    it. <BR> <BR>So, all three of those example uses are valid. However, to make the
    contrast more clear, one might say for #3, &#34;I accidentally pasted the glyph
    for the character A into the window for the character B.&#34; <BR> <BR>John&#39;s
    definition is the most correct. But if you want us to simplify &#40;at the risk
    of losing some accuracy&#41;, I&#39;d say: A character is the abstract idea of
    a letter, like the letter &#34;A.&#34; A glyph is a particular version of a letter.
    So the character &#34;A&#34; in Warnock Pro Italic has a default glyph, but also
    has at least a couple of alternate glyphs, including a swash form and a small
    cap. So there&#39;s one character, but three glyphs. <BR> <BR>Of course, characters
    actually go beyond letters. Things like numbers or even musical notes or certain
    symbols can be characters, as long as they have defined encoding slots, and are
    not simply alternate forms of something else. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also worth noting
    that the relationship between glyphs and characters is <i>n</i>-to-<i>m</i>, where
    n and m are integers zero or greater. In plain English, that suggests that several
    characters may combine to form one glyph &#40;as in a fraction or ligature&#41;,
    and several glyphs may combine to form a single character &#40;as with an accented
    letter, created on the fly from a letter glyph and an accent glyph&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>It gets even more complicated with some other languages. English is the &#34;easy&#34;
    case. And there&#39;s a whole realm of debate on when to encode glyphs as their
    own characters, but I&#39;ve spent too much time on that in email with John lately,
    so I think I won&#39;t go there tonight....  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Leslie, I think the most elegant simplification of &#34;glyph&#34; would be
    to say that it&#39;s &#34;an instance of a character&#34;, meaning that it&#39;s
    a given rendering of a letter, numeral, or really any symbol, even stuff that&#39;s
    not encoded. The other terms, like &#34;character&#34;, &#34;letter&#34;, &#34;symbol&#34;
    are really abstract concepts, with no inherent physical presence, maybe not even
    a structural definition&#42;. That&#39;s why really unorthodox glyphs can often
    be identified as being a certain letter with great certainty. <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;ve
    come to realize for example that you can never really <i>show</i> the essence

    this right?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, because a font is just a big collection of glyphs.
    Even within a font, and within FontLab, the relationship of a glyph cell to character&#40;s&#41;
    is not one-to-one: a single glyph can be mapped to multiple characters &#40;this
    is very common in TrueType font, e.g. the /space/ glyph will be mapped to both
    the regular space character and the non-breaking space character&#41;. <BR> <BR>I
    believe the easiest way to think about the distinction is to accept that &#39;character&#39;
    is no longer a typographic term. Glyph is a typographic term that refers to the
    little images and to their storage in a font. Character is a text encoding term
    that refers to the abstract identity of, e.g. an uppercase A, that is stored as
    a number on a computer. The two concepts only come together during display of
    text, when the characters in the text are mapped to glyphs in a given font.'

    It is full of useful information, a significant amount of which is new to me,
    and it is done with charm and a light touch.  <BR> <BR>I particularly appreciate
    the creative and excellent typography.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;d think that good typography
    would be a given in a book about type, but it seems that is often not so. For
    example, am I the only one who thinks that &#39;Type &amp; typography&#39; by
    Baines and Haslam is a typographic disaster? <BR> <BR>A typographic comparison
    - appropriate as both are full of type and lettering illustrations, presenting
    a similar design challenge.  <BR> <BR>Both are on bright white coated paper, which
    of course helps with the illustrations, especially  color. Baines &amp; Haslam
    put all their type on the bright white pages, with a resulting dazzle that detracts
    from readability. Carbarga softly shades most pages, or uses colored type against
    white, squelching the dazzle, enhancing readability and adding a pleasant variety.
    <BR> <BR>For text Bains and Haslam use a small size &#40;9 or 10 point&#41; of
    Swift in a long measure - I count 80 characters - and try to counteract the wide
    line with large leading - something like 10/14 point. Swift was designed for newspapers,
    which have narrow columns closely set, and hence is a condensed face with large
    x-height. Using it totally differently I think flops. The long line with the short
    extenders is just plain unpleasant to read, especially with the dazzle. <BR> <BR>By
    contrast Cabarga uses the ridiculously easy-to-read Century Schoolbook &#40;I
    think&#41;, whose wide letters match the sometimes wide measure, with an effortly
    readable result. <BR> <BR>The captions and side bars in Bains and Haslam are in
    Meta, negatively tracked so tight that it is hard to read, for me at least.  <BR>
    <BR>The captions and side bars in Carbarga are in narrow columns in a compressed
    sans &#40;what is it?&#41; which is very readable. It adds fuel to my belief that
    only narrow sans work well in text. In any case the typeface and the measure and
    leading are beautifully matched.  <BR> <BR>Finally, Bains and Haslam have quotations
    on typography from various luminaries. They are set in a huge, 42 point Meta,
    with no leading, running across two-page spreads. The text runs continuously,
    but the two-page spreads are separated by 32 pages. This puts the spreads at the
    middle of signatures, so the text can align perfectly across the two pages. Clever,
    but reading the stuff is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Also the credits
    for the quotations jump back to the 10 point Swift, a totally different scale
    - a violation of Cabarga&#39;s rule 20 of the &#34;Immutable laws of Lettering
    - and the myriad of exceptions thereto.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Overall, the effect in
    Bains and Haslem is of clever innovation whose result is off-puttingly difficult
    to read, and visually ungainly.  <BR> <BR>In Cabarga, I think more consistency
    from page spread to page spread would make the design stronger, as he uses many
    different principles to organize his page spreads. This threatens toward the visual
    chaos, but he manages to keep it undercontrol, perhaps by control of scale from
    page to page. The bottom line is that every page spread is inviting, readable,
    and effectively gets across what he wants to explain. To convey such a large amount
    of technical information in such an agreeable way - both visually and literarily
    - is an impressive achievement.    '
