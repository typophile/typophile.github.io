  body: Dear Marconi, <BR> <BR>This is a nice project. Even with so many other typefaces
    with this same principles, It has somenthing that sparks from the rest. <BR> <BR>Here
    are some comments/suggestions wich I guess you should consider... <BR> <BR>1.
    The uppercase S seems to be falling to the right. <BR>2. The lowercase r has a
    spacing problem on the right margin. <BR>3. There are some weight problens on
    your figures. Clearly the 3 is much heavier than 1 or 2, and so are 4, 5, 6 and
    8. <BR>4. You uppercase M seems too wide, comparing to the entire font <BR>5.
    I guess your descender must go down a little bit more... thinking in a text oriented
    typeface. <BR> <BR>Just think about it. <BR>Keep up this good work! It would be
    a nice family. <BR>Go on!! <BR> <BR>Fabio Luiz Haag <BR>

  body: 'Although your vertical proportions are well balanced, the huge x-height means
    that: <BR>- The font will work best for small sizes &#40;I&#39;d say ~8pt in this
    case&#41;. <BR>- You need to pull some tricks to make more room for the descenders,
    specifically by making the bowls of the &#34;g&#34;, &#34;p&#34; and &#34;q&#34;
    rise [slightly] above the baseline. <BR> <BR>And a question: Could you explain
    the vertical distribution of the numerals? <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s best to use
    GIF &#40;not JPEG&#41; for type samples. <BR>You can see all the artefacts especially
    around the white-on-orange text. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Nice work, Marconi, it&#39;s getting much better. <BR>Good points, Fabio.
    <BR>I&#39;d add that your caps are too dark, and: U and S are wide, P is narrow
    and Y is too light. <BR>There are some little weight inconsistencies over the
    alphabet, and finally, I think your non-alphabetical glyphs need some work. <BR>Keep
    it up! <BR>Abra'

  body: Beleza Marconi, <BR> <BR>Your Petala Sans is a very good work,  <BR>i like
    to see the &#34;mini-descenders&#34; <BR>but i&#39;m not convinced this works
    fine <BR>in the long texts! <BR> <BR>- Your Ampersand is cool ;D <BR>- The terminal
    in the lw r is <BR>  a bit long <BR> <BR>...Good trip to the extra light <BR>to
    ultra black! <BR> <BR>E bem vindo a m

  body: 'Hello Marconi, finnaly you put your font to critic and like you see you have
    good sujestions to you continue your work. I don&#39;t want to repeat some sujestions
    but I leave you some comments. <BR>-Your lowercase &#40;k&#41; is strange, probably
    you must work this letter.  <BR>- Your figure &#40;7&#41; have a wrong position,
    alighn this figure like &#40;5&#41;, exemple. <BR>-Your '
