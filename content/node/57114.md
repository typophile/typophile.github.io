  medium]]:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/effra_5468.png]\r\n\r\nTop
  line is a preview from their website (14pt). Bottom line is the output from the
  Inkscape. I have never seen anything as ugly come out of Inkscape rasterizer and
  frankly I have no idea what to do about it. \r\n\r\nRasterizing using Windows' native
  rasterizer (i.e. with Windows Paint) yields slightly thinner appearance, but produces
  very heavy pixelation.\r\n\r\nI sent Dalton-Maag an email, but just wanted to ask
  here as well for any guidance.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or comments ?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nPS.
  By the way, this is just another argument in favor of try-then-buy licensing model.
  No online preview tool could've caught this issue. I bought into their rasterization
  of the font and now I am forced to deal with the consequences. Needless to say it's
  not what I had in mind."

    another application.

    also got a reply from D-M pointing out that it's a anti-aliasing gamma issue.
    Which in retrospect makes total sense, except there's no way to adjust the gamma
    in the software I'm using at the moment."

  body: "I had to look up Inkscape - it's apparently a vector image editing package.
    Traditionally (eg. Corel and Illustrator)  deal with text of all types with various
    effects, angles and nasties like text on a curve. Because of this they basically
    treat text like other vector graphics, slap it down, scan convert it and let the
    pixels fall where they may. Only in recent years, and only in vector formats like
    Flash has text quality been seen as important. \r\n\r\nSo what would explain this
    font being rendered worse than others? Perhaps, it\u2019s a TrueType vs PostScript
    issue? I wonder if the results would be better if the font were first converted
    to PostScript or OT CFF?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My guess is that it has to do with the shape of the letters rather than anything
    else. I.e. there could be a lot of curve segments that generate 60-70% coverage
    of individual pixels when rasterized to a small size, and this somehow amplifies
    the effect of inappropriate gamma value in anti-aliasing module. Check this out:
    same image as in the first post above, but the second line is now gamma corrected:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/effra-2_5139.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't have much in the way that can help with this question, but I thought
    I'd add that recently (version 0.46 on Linux) Inkscape pleasantly surprised me
    by clearly and seamlessly doing ligature substitutions while I typed. I was using
    Fontin Sans. It doesn't do them for all typefaces (even typefaces that I've verified
    _have_ the ligatures), but it does it for some. I'll have to do some checking
    now about the formats for which this feature is supported.\r\n\r\nWhen I've used
    Inkscape to produce bitmap output, I've sometimes made very large bitmaps and
    shrunk them in a program like GIMP or Photoshop.  I'm sure you've probably thought
    of that, but I thought I'd mention it, just to have something constructive to
    add.\r\n\r\nst"
