  is Matthew Crowe so decided to play of my last name and the phrase, 'to crow about
  it' adapted to 'Crowe About It' and 'Something To Crowe About'. To show people croweing
  about my work I used a speech bubble with a creative, designed font inside. I have
  chosen five colours to differentiate each promotional material, for example each
  letter head a client received could have a different coloured logo on, accompanied
  by a different colour business etc. You get the idea. I did this to spice up the
  design a bit.\r\n\r\nMy current logo design will be adapted to suit certain needs,
  ie, CD cover would say 'Something to Crowe About Inside'.\r\n\r\nFor business cards
  I decided to take the entire shape of the speech bubble. Although it would cost
  more, the initial cost of the die cut will only be a one off payment.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts and criticisms will be very much appreciated, I do not want to commit to
  a design and then realise I have made mistakes or could improve it.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: Sorry I have probably got that mixed up. It is more promotional advertisement.
    No set logo but adaptations of the idea which is the speech bubble etc. As for
    the font there is no specific reason as I chose it apart from it being bold and
    more creative, may have to take a look at that. Thank you.

    message you'd like to send across?\r\n\r\n2. Logo doesn't really seem like a logo
    but an application of some sort of design. It doesn't work as a logo. And your
    business card doesn't have the logo at all if all the words should be on the logo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Unless
    you use this as your promotional/advertising material this is not a working logo.
    But as promotional/advertising it is very well executed and quite appropriate.</strong>"

  body: "Promotion then? Ok, you're on the right track. And having 5 different colours
    makes sense and would be very nice.\r\n\r\nBut a nice simple logo along with it
    could be welcome as well. The only logo I can see with this (and would play along
    very well is one without a symbol. Pure type. Same as you used on the back of
    your business card. Maybe play with letter positions, weight, colour or anything
    else. But pure type logo would work very well."

  body: Thank you.  I will have to play about with that. Going back to the business
    card, on the back do you think the writing is all ok, layout wise. Should the
    contact details, M,E and W be left aligned or do you think it looks ok staggered
    how it is?

    sure that the grunge font on one side and the corporate look on the other quite
    go together.\r\n\r\nYou might consider putting your name in bold and giving \"designer\"
    a cap D. And the M E W abbreviations probably aren't needed; everyone knows what
    those lines are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I will change my name to bold.\r\n\r\nIt is not allowing me to upload any more
    images for some reason. Is there a technical issue? I have uploaded it to an image
    hosing site for the time being, hope there are no rules against this. I chose
    the grungy font because it was different and gained viewers attention and kept
    the back simple to not distract from the front as the front is very bold and in
    your face.\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/f/222/screenshot20110512at213.png/"

  body: "I think those changes have helped.\r\n\r\n> I have chosen five colours\r\n\r\nNot
    sure if you mean the cards will be printed in 5 different color variations, too,
    or just the other materials. If you mean the cards, I'd suggest asking your printer
    how it would affect the price to print it as 5 separate flat colors, rather than
    using CMYK. It will cost more, but the colors will be better and the type will
    reverse out more cleanly. \r\n\r\n(One way to reduce the cost of flat colors is
    to ask which ink colors the printer already has in stock, as those may be cheaper
    than custom-mixed colors.)\r\n"

  body: "Thank you. I have contacted a printer, he suggested that it would need to
    be done using a four colour process rather than spot colour unless I wanted to
    pay \xA325+ for each colour change. To get the die cut made would cost between
    \xA350 and \xA3100(one off charge), to get 100-10000(price does not vary) punched
    would cost \xA360 and to get 500 printed would be \xA360. He said using the four
    colour process would keep the price the same, so could split the 500 into 5x100cards."

  body: "I think the layout of the info is nice, but I don't get the m, e, w.  Are
    you concerned that people will not know which is which?  I would skip right to
    the info, which speaks for itself.  If you had a cell and an office phone, and
    a fax phone, then I can see making the distinction, but here it is not ambiguous
    at all.  And why M for telephone?\r\n\r\nI like the idea of \"crow about it\"
    and it really ties in nicely with your URL.  I would stick with that phrase throughout
    the branding.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat subjective, but to me the grunge font does
    not seem \"creative\" or \"different and gained viewers attention\".  To me it
    says \"trend follower\" in a bit outdated style.  Unfortunately every teenager
    10+ years ago discovered these grunge fonts, and subsequently they became very
    trendy and were largely used in amateur designs.  I would strongly suggest you
    consider other options unless that particular style is a strong component of your
    overall portfolio.  That may be the best strategy to determining the style - play
    to what your work is all about.  I hope my perspective is helpful."

    mobile telephone. \r\n\r\nI agree that the font has been overused however I have
    tried some other more clear yet still bold fonts but am not sure if they are working
    for my liking.\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/27/screenshot20110513at201.png/\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "@Matt: Well isn't it obvious? You should use some more contemporary styled
    faces instead of Arial and Futura. Your grunge looking font has modern shapes
    while the other couple don't. They also seem to be very crowded with not enough
    white space around them.\r\n\r\nUrbana Bold/Black seem much more appropriate\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cepuertas/urbana/\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure you can find more yourself."

  body: "That is a huge improvement in my opinion.  Some other strategies to try:\r\n\r\n-
    Have the text bleed off the edges so it suggests a shout so loud that it didn't
    even fit in the speech bubble.  \r\n\r\n- Play around with the length and size
    of each line.  Try a bit more tracking.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."
