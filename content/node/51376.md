  whose works we\u2019ve been acquiring actively in the last couple of years is influential
  arts and crafts era illustrator, author and designer Walter Crane. Crane\u2019s
  childrens books, illustrated classics and collections of Shakespearean woodcuts
  are outstanding examples of the best of work of the artist as craftsman and are
  characterized by both technical skill and a unique retrospective vision which typefies
  the best of the late 19th century Arts and Crafts movement.\r\n\r\nAlthough not
  as recognized today or as great a critical success, in many ways Crane outshines
  even the great William Morris. While his written works are not as highly regarded
  as Morris\u2019 poems and novels and he never made the same kind of mark in interior
  design (though his wallpaper designs are arguably much more inventive than any of
  Morris\u2019 work), Crane\u2019s artistic and literary output was enormous, and
  his success in taking the arts and crafts style into the commericial mass market
  was remarkable. Crane had the attention to detail which is the mark of the true
  craftsman. He wrote, designed, illustrated and often hand lettered his books and
  even had a hand in the printing, binding and publishing in many cases. Crane made
  it his goal to produce remarkable illustrated works for children at a price which
  the common man could afford. He was also active as an art teacher throughout his
  career, mentored many students and left behind a number of very informative texts
  on art and design.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been working on fonts from small samples of
  his lettering to include in the Walter Crane package we have in development and
  it\u2019s been a challenge because most of the samples we\u2019ve had to work from
  are limited and require a lot of extrapolation. Then, much to our surprise, a parallel
  project of acquiring books by noted paleographer Lewis Day turned up a Day book
  with a couple of full sample alphabets hand lettered by Crane. It was a real breakthrough
  for the project, giving us a nucleus of the font collection which will eventually
  be in the package.\r\n\r\nThe first of our Walter Crane fonts is Crane Gothic, based
  on lettering which offers a unique and original interpretation of late gothic inscribed
  lettering characteristic of 16th century monumental brasses and stone carvings.
  It has a full character set with capitals and small caps, plus numbers and punctuation. "
