    generally have a more feminine design, so you might want to search my fonts for
    'humanist sans'\r\n"

  body: "Some people think that a feminine sans serif has one or more of the following
    characteristics: lighter weight, rounded ends, less mechanical/geometric construction,
    i.e. more of a handwritten feel etc. Easy to find these. Whether they are actually
    more feminine is a matter of opinion.\r\nDon"
