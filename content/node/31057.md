  body: Thanks, Bob. I don't want to sidetrack the main subject of this thread, but
    where did you get this info from? When Mark Batty has a book that is out of print,
    they list it as out of print. Same goes for Amazon. But neither of them list it
    at all. I think something else is going on here. Maybe the book died a quiet death
    before it ever got finished, and the project was scrapped.

    how does your teacher pronounce Mr. Benguiat's name?\r\nBen-GAT (rhymes with 'hat')
    or BEN-geeyaht (both using hard 'G')?\r\n\r\nActually, I've seen Ed accept both
    pronunciations... but greatly depends on which country and circumstance.\r\n\r\n>
