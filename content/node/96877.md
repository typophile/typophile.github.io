    and V, for instance, are cut at the top/bottom, and I bears no blossom; in any
    case thanks a lot\r\n\r\nd"

    you list are easy customisations by whoever made the logo."

  body: "Beppe: That\u2019s why I said cutted. The (lowercase) font was just cut at
    the top of the A and at the bottom of V. Use the lowercase I and cut it at the
    top: So it has no blossom. Easy as that \u2026 "

  body: "Beppe: At closer inspection I see, that the blossoms of Flores are a little
    bit different to your sample. So maybe the logo creator was just inspired by Flores
    and made one for himself \u2026 "

    original typeface, which exists, as the samples gathered show, but apparently
    not as a digital font."

  body: "well, i don't know..\r\nmaybe it's just a simple customisation of flores,
    maybe not;\r\nthe logo is something that comes from seventies with its own design,
    and doesn't seem a blossomy variation of a thirties font like flores appears to
    be: to me recalls other, more recent decorative designs such as the typefaces
    once published by letraset or mecanorma; anyway, here is the original picture
    of the shop sign, which may not add anything to the whole history, but it's a
    fact\r\nciao\r\n\r\nbeppe[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Photo-03-10-12-09-21-42_3808.jpg]"

  body: To me the similarities are enough to say that your sample is related to the
    ones that inspired Flores. If you would like to see another example (this time
    horizontally compressed) you could look at the sign of "Libreria della Natura"
    in Corso Magenta.

  body: "ok, thanks riccardo\r\ni'll pass there to see it;\r\ni also found in an interesting
    book on shop signs, industrial/vernacular signs, architectural letterings and
    so on (http://www.eyemagazine.com/review/article/signs-of-life-under-an-iron-fist,
    http://www.graphicfront.ro/en/graphicfront-books/hand-drawn-emboss-volumetric/)
    that i recently bought, an example in use of this \"flores\" font, for a shop
    (i guess in the seventies) somewhere in romania;\r\nthe book is really interesting
    and full of old-times odd materials: it's worth its price, and i suggest it\r\n\r\nb"
