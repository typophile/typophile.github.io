  body: "Thank you!\r\n\r\nThe bottle apparently came from my mother-in-law's childhood
    village, judging by the address on the lable. She's over 70 now, perhaps she took
    the old bottle with her when she got married?\r\n\r\nFunny thing about the Spring
    Gardens Lane is, that as far as I know, that route doesn't work anymore. The house
    the sign is on is ancient, one of the oldest in the area."
