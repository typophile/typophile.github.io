  In my mind, I can see that it is somewhat reminiscent of Uncial lettering, and clearly
  has a monastery or \"churchy\" feel to it, yet cannot seem to pinpoint a reference
  that would be a much better example of what this is trying to accomplish...\r\n\r\nThe
  key element is the \"A\" as it matches the roof line of the venue, which is an old
  chapel.\r\n\r\nThanks for any insights or direction!\r\n"
