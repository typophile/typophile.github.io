body: "Hello,\r\n\r\ni\xB4m looking for an alternative of old Akzidenz Grotesk. I`ve
  desigend an fashion identity with it and i miss thin and ultralight cuts now. After
  that the capitals are bigger than rest letters, that isn`t beautiful. Of course,
  i can use Helvetica, but \"s,c,e\" of extended Akzidenz Grotesk give main charakter
  to my creation and Helvetica Extended isn`t so wide than extended AG. Question:
  does it exist \"New Akzizend Grotesk\" or somethink similar, even with my specifications?
  (thin, ultralight, wide extended, clean). Thanks a lot."

  body: "hmm many typefaces were inspired by Akzidenz Grotesk most notably Morris
    Fuller Benton's 1903 Alternate Gothic is a condensed design directly inspired
    by Akzidenz. Lightline Gothic, News Gothic and Franklin Gothic were also ATF's
    grotesk typefaces inspired by Akz. (ITC Franklin Gothic is the bastard child of
    this ATF family).\r\n\r\n"

      \ Temporary www: http://www.christinefuchs.com \r\n\r\nThe point is LL Akkurat
      by Linetto for example is fine draw, clean typeface. You can see that AG Wide
      unclean face even at bigger sizes. And for fashion purposes it needs to be ultralight
      to affect as \"normal\" at big sizes on banner, poster or website. Light cut
      isn`t enough. I`m surprised that nobody tryed \"contemporary clean up\" of this
      typeface till this day. "

    has neither thin nor ultralight weight. Otherwise, it is very close in style to
    Akzidenz-Grotesk.

    to give ultimate strandout to the <em>Christ\xEDne Fuchs</em> 'label' which is
    exquisite (especially the 'f') and should not be competed against, but rather
    complemented to the full. There's a real danger of trying to give the same look
    all over which may not help with the recognition of a logotype."

  body: Some inconstancy things in that typeface. The trapping of the M compare to
    the A and the opposite slant arm in the E seems out of the style. However thoses
    slant are less visible in the light weight and to me works well with the lower
    case t.
