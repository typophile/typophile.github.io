  body: Thanks, I've always wondered (I walk by the storefront often) and I had no

  body: "Jan, I guess your remark refers to the (non-existent) image?\r\nThere is
    no sample, neither RGB nor CMYK \u2013 but a link! In case you haven\u2019t spotted
    it (I guess so. Hint: it\u2019s the word \u2018here\u2019), then <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/contact\">please
    support my request </a> for a little more distinctive styling of inline links
