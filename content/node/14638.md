  pay money. Anybody interested in bartering his/her copy (new or lightly used) please
  contact me (via this thread, or my Typophile profile, or the Typophile IM, or carrier
  pigeon). I have a lot of stuff, and can get almost anything (photocopied, photographed
  or scanned) from UCLA. So, what's your pleasure? Typographic requests only please.
