body: I have a school assigment to create a logo for a printing company called &#34;STRONG
  IMAGE&#34; I really would like to go with type only, and avoid an image, but I keep
  using a fist or a lion to symbolize strength. Anyone have ideas. If anyone should
  have websites that can help, I would be grateful.

    shadow. I&#39;d also tend towards a sans serif face and probably all caps. At
    least thats where I&#39;d start. Dan

    As if the words made a building. I&#39;d also stay sans serif and all caps. Thats
    where I&#39;d start, Dan
