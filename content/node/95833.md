body: Saw this beautifully utilitarian sticker the other day, and each of the typefaces
  looks familiar, but a little off. The first style feels like a Futura Condensed
  Bold, and the second style feels like a Futura Demi or similar, but look at the
  lowercase 'g's - they seem to have a vernacular humanism that can't handle the geometric
  demands of a true Futura. Do these letterforms have a digital corollary? I can't
  help but imagine that they only exist in a forgotten sub-basement machine shop of
  a County building somewhere in downtown LA. The apparent News Gothic at bottom seems
  appropriate for Joe Friday types, and the apparent Futura numerals at lower left
  feel like Arnold Schoenberg at a Pacific Palisades pool party. Can someone point
  me to digital versions of these, and if not, then directions to the LA County print
  shop?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_LACounty_3679.JPG]
