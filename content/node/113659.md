  body: "Giles, \r\nThanks for your suggestions. Rotis Semi Serif might be a good
    substitute, although it has some differences. Ninfa has a more similar R, but
    the lower case letters aren't exactly what i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAlso, i did
    find a lower case word, written (probably) with the same font, if it helps:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/print2_3824.jpg]"
