  body: I would love to know myself. This reminds me of a typeface I saw in an old
    typesetting catalog, that hadn't been digitized, but the name escapes me. It's
    definitely not in the univers, helvetica, raleigh gothic, or alternate gothic
    families.

  body: "Yeah, it looks like there will only be approximations. I thought that there
    might be an \"official\" version out there that all the others imitated.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like Cst Berlin and Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed are the closest.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the replies. If anybody knows the original font, feel free to post. FYI, the
    sample was taken from a Chip Kidd cover design in the early 90's...so it's possible
    that it was pre-digital."
