body: I'm a student at the Ontario College of Art & Design, creating a travel magazine
  called When in Roam. It's about blending and participating in current and contemporary
  local culture when abroad. This is an interactive magazine encouraging people to
  be active observers and participants in their travel experience. In my photo essay
  I'm showing postcards (front & back) from the destination each issue is themed around.
  The first publication is featuring Buenos Aires. So, I'm asking for anyone in BA
  or South American countries to send me postcards to feature in the magazine. I will
  pass on my address to all those lovely participants interested! Thanks so much for
  the help.
