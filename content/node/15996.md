  list recently. I hope I'm not\r\nthe only one who feels this way..\r\n\r\n\"\r\n>
  Neither process is easy, nor was the challenge faced by Peter\r\n> the Great in
  his efforts to open Russia's 'window to the West'.\r\n\r\nNot only difficult, but
  both also have a \"dark side\",\r\nespecially in this age of globalization. I don't
  mean to\r\nbe a troublemaker, but I hope there are enough signs now\r\n(such as
  my essay in Spatium #4) that something like Peter\r\nthe Great's reform isn't automatically
  good in every way,\r\nespecially as times and politics change. I think we can\r\nagree
  that at a minimum it's worth discussing potential\r\n\"complications\".\r\n\r\nI
  hope that somewhere in the celebrations there can be some\r\nsmall room for sobering
  dissent as to the true effects of this\r\nmost notable case of Latinization on today's
  world, both within\r\ntypography and on a broader scale. I hope that's not too much\r\nto
  expect of an *international* organization.\r\n\r\nAs with anything that a group
  of people are proud of, this can\r\nbe a touchy subject. But I think open discourse
  is still valuable,\r\nand I very much hope to hear expressions of fruitful ambivalence\r\nconcerning
  this anniversary from other members as well.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIt was Chris Lozos I think
  who recently made a small critique\r\nof the Cyrillic structures, and although I
  think formalism is\r\nalways limited in relevance, I believe Chris does have a valid\r\npoint,
  somewhere; and in fact to me any script has features\r\nand attributes that need
  objective attention in order to\r\nimprove, or at the very least to be really understood.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for thread titles) so I didn't bother to try to track it down. It was something
    about Cyrillic \"always looking like smallcaps\", and I remember Maxim Zhukov
    didn't like that sentiment. Who was it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "That was me. It was in relation to Greek matching the look of the latin text.
    I think it was a thread Nick started when he was starting a design of Greek to
    be part of an existing font. My point was that it is hard to mix scripts and be
    true to the script yet be true to the type design all while keeping it look even
    in color. My mention of Cyrillic was just an aside example to show how a reader
    might misconstrue the Cyrillic as small caps latin if it were on the same line
    as the latin. I probably didn't word it very well and Maxim misunderstood me.
    \ It was really not a big deal and Maxim was apologetic afterwards. I wouldn't
    make too much of that.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15819\r\n\r\nChrisL"
