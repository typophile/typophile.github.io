  I created in HighLogic Font Creator. Recently a user who downloaded one of my fonts
  emailed me saying that the top and bottom of the font are being cut off when she
  uses it in a program. It's just an issue with line spacing, which I know how to
  adjust quickly in  Font Creator using the Metrics options. However since making
  the fonts I've switched to a Mac which doesn't support Font Creator, and I've been
  using FontLab. I can't seem to make any sense of the metrics options in it. \r\nIs
  there an easy way to adjust line height in FontLab?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: I have version 5.0.2, and it doesn't seem to have any of the options discussed
    in the guide. My menus look completely different. Is there that big of a difference
    between mine and 5.0.4? And is this possible in 5.0.2?
