  image, or something that comes close.\r\nThe image shows a digital copy of a 60's
  effect from japan, which uses the same font style. I posted the digital image because
  it is a little more clearer. Especially the letter o is \"typical\" maybe.\r\nI'm
  positive that the \"E\" in the word Echo at the top left is custom.\r\nI don't have
  any more info about it, sorry.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the images shows but here's
  a link to make sure.\r\nhttp://www.uaudio.com/store/delay-modulation/roland-re201.html\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roland_re201_hq[1]2_4798.jpg]"

  body: "If you go through the many Sci-Fi & Techno fonts at Dafont and elsewhere,
    I expect that you could find an almost exact match to the lettering. In the interim
    here is a very close and well made font by Ryoichi Tsunekawa based on Japanese
    robot animations, sold as Geom Graphic by Flat-it http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/geom-graphic/
    I agree that the second E is custom.\r\nDon"
