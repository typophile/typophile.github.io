body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt seems like a lot of designers are now using sans that aren't
  exactly 'geometrical' like Gotham, Helvetica etc. I recently purchased [[http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php|Freight
  Sans]], but are curious to what else it out there. [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026|Whitney]]
  is in the same style I guess and Stag Sans is great too. What is the official name
  of this style of sans font?\r\n\r\nThe font I'm looking for would be similar to
  Freight sans (with or without two story g), but I would like something a bit cleaner
  if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nI've included some images of various fonts. The
  new sans font from Wired magazine has already been discussed in here somewhere,
  but I'd still like to know more about it.\r\n\r\nFont from Wired Magazine\r\n\r\nFont
  from The Independent Magazine\r\n\r\nFont from Outside Magazine\r\n\r\nI know that
  the fonts in Wired and Outside are most likely custom fonts, so suggestions for
  similar fonts are very welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wired_4130.jpg]<br><br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/independent_4889.jpg]<br><br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outside_3573.jpg]"

  body: The font from Independent 'Lovely Rita' could actually be Whitney, but it
    seems like it's neither the bold nor the black weight.

  body: "I would describe Freight, Stag, and Whitney as somewhere between [[humanist]]
    and [[gothic]] or [[grotesque]]. Whitney, for example, is based on the structure
    of a gothic (Trade Gothic) but its finish gives it a more humanist air.\r\n\r\nHelvetica
    is commonly categorized as a \"neo-grotesque\".\r\n\r\nThe \"Outside\" font is
    not Gotham, though the caps are very similar. It's most likely something custom
    from [[Font Bureau]], who often works with publishers like these. As for their
    retail fonts, you might dig their Antenna or Amplitude.\r\n\r\nIn the vein of
    Whitney are [[Lucas de Groot]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/taz_iii/\">Taz</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/spiegel/\">Spiegel</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Corpid\">Corpid</a>.\r\n\r\nNew
    faces in the neo-grotesque realm include <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/\">Maquette</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_complete_ot/\">Proxima
    Nova</a>, <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/\">Akkurat</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Paralucent\">Paralucent</a> (though
    this last one could be called a \"neo-neo-grotesque\" or \"pseudo-neo-grot\".\r\n\r\nIf
    you're interested in typeface classifications I highly recommend getting a copy
    of [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]]'s \"Elements of Typographic Style\"."
