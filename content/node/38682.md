    and all the functions that go with them. <strong>Astronomical symbols</strong>
    include the planets, sub-planets (or whatever they're calling Pluto <em>et al</em>
    these days), comets, etc., and the symbols for their motions. There is some overlap,
    because planets are used in both, but there are also alternate glyphs for certain
    celestial objects that are preferred by practitioners of one or the other."

    me because they feel right with his font but contrary to my original urge are
    actually more simplified and actually more like illustrations than type or writing.
    Which makes me thing similar weights but a genetly different style is actually
    what's called for. Do you agree? Or what do you see in the example?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: These are nice. What is also interesting is the variation. Look at Uranus
    ( the 3rd from the right at the bottom ) It's a totally different symbol. Take
    a look at Jupiter ( lower left corner ) It's the same glyph but these are very
    different.  Knowing what the symbol is of seems to be helping me as I am designing
    mine. Some of them are a bit hard to connect though. Like Capricorn, which looks
    a bit like a vs in this example ( 4th over 2nd row ). Capricorn is another one
    with more than one symbol.

  body: "The symbols are more used in tables than anything else, simply to save space.
    Astrological and astronomical tables are called <strong>ephemerides</strong> (singular,
    <strong>ephemeris</strong>). There are some examples [[http://www.khaldea.com/kldaephem/2000/jan2007gmt.shtml|here]]
    and [[http://www.astro.com/swisseph/ae/2000/d5ge1_2007.pdf|here]].\r\n\r\nThey
    can also be used to describe planetary and orbital elements in equations and comparisons.
    For example, the eccentricity of Saturn's orbit could be symbolized thus: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/eccsaturn_5078.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nSatellites
    of planets (moons) are designated by Roman numeral subscripts of the planetary
    symbols, typically (but not always) in order of discovery. Therefore, Jupiter's
    moon Thebes, the 14th discovered, would be:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thebes_6557.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    guess then the following would be accurate, but I've never seen it quite expressed
    like this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moonearth_6237.gif]\r\n\r\nStars
    are usually listed in tables by what is known as their [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_designation|Bayer
    designation]]. That includes a Greek letter (usually in order of magnitude or
    brightness, but there are exceptions) followed by the three-letter symbol for
    the constellation. So the second-brightest star in Orion (also called Rigel) is
    listed as <strong>\u03B2 Ori</strong>.\r\n\r\nThose are just some examples. There
    are lots of uses for them, mostly in tabular matter and scientific listings.\r\n\r\n(If
    you end up with a good font that has symbols like these, I'd like to get a copy
    somehow, thank you.)"

    It is a monospace so it is a trifle inelegant for astronomy - but on the other
    hand it is a also sans ( mostly - a mono cannot be untterly sans) and so it is
    appropriately very tech. When I have the symbols done I will post them in another
    thread ( or maybe here ) so you and any of your astronomically inclined pals can
    have at them. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind I would love to know what font you favor
    at the moment and why. \r\n\r\nAre there any books that I might get from my library
    that would be considered standards for proper Astronomical table making?\r\n\r\nI
    just noticed the 'aspects' as well. It looks like they should be a bit less heavy
    than the main glyphs. And a bit less tall. Almost like a Upper Case & Lower Case
    but with weight thrown into the mix as well. Or, is that always so?"

    symbols, whiskers, falling water and nipples e.g. don't scale as well as letters.

    and small design for these or you get blobs of none-to-attractive ink at small

  body: "OK, if you are making a monospace font, you have to remember that certain
    glyphs, such as for Sun (\u2609) and Earth (\u2295) for example, need to be as
    circular as possible, so they may be taller than x-height, but not quite as tall
    as cap height. You can probably sit them on the baseline, but you might want to
    experiment and see if floating them somewhere between the baseline and the top
    of the caps works better.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're going to do this right, you need
    the proper symbols for degrees, minutes and seconds of angles, called <em>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_%28symbol%29|prime
    symbols]]</em>. (In non-technical material, some people try to get away with using
    either straight or smart quotes. It works, but it isn't quite accurate.)\r\n\r\nProper
    symbols are: <strong>&deg; &prime; &Prime;</strong>\r\n\r\nUsing straight quotes
    would look like this: <strong>&deg; &apos; &quot;</strong> -- not totally unacceptable,
    but not perfect, either.\r\n\r\nUsing regular quotes would be like this: <strong>&deg;

    distinctive enough from your alphanumerics, both Latin and Greek, because typesetters

    symbol <strong>\u2643</strong> can't be confused with a <strong>4</strong>. Or

    height and then the symbols like the  My plan right now is to make the Earth &
    sun symbols center in with the taller Symbols. Glyphs like Ascending node \u260A

    will let you be the judge of this schemes success or failure when the glyphs are

    care anything about individual stars, but I suppose if it did, you could mix the
