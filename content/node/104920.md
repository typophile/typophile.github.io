  was given a piece of printed material with the word \u201CTime\u201D in the title.\r\nIt
  is set in Minion Pro typeface, and the capital T and small i seem to be a ligature
  because the dot of the i is not present, and the bottom serif of the i sits within
  the width of the T hat. (please refer to the attached jpeg)\r\n\r\nI have looked
  over the entire glyphs of the typeface several times, tried selecting both Ligature
  and Discretionary Ligature. \r\nNone of them seem to give me the result.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is definite is that the word is only within Minion Pro family (glyphs included),
  in one text frame only, the letters are not kerned, are evenly tracked, and the
  i is not rendered in any way to have the dot removed.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have also
  tried using the number 1 and Latin small dotless i; however, none of the number
  1 resembles the i on the page, and latin dotless i would need to be either kerned
  or tracked close to the T, but I was told that these two actions are not involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.\r\n*Please see the attached jpeg of what
  the word supposedly looks like; I created it using Latin small dotless i, reduce
  the tracking between T and i."

  body: Not a ligature, unless someone has made a custom version of the font containing
    one. I'd say that's just T followed by dotless i, and if the latter needs kerning
    to look like this, then kerning has been applied and what you were told it incorrect.

    and the combination \u201CT\u0131\u201D is indeed kerned within the font, as John
    assumed."

  body: "The kerning given by the font is -80 (as in the first line below). To get
    the T\u0131 as close as the jpg above, I have to fix it to about -115 in InDesign
    (as shown in the little box for kerning)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/kerning_6653.png\">\r\n\r\nIf
    the kerning was not done in InDesign, then I suspect a special kerning pair was
    added to the font.\r\n\r\nIt may also be possible with luaTeX to add that kerning
    pair without touching the font. That would satisfy, in some way, all the given
    requirements.\r\n"

  body: "The sample appears to be a display version of Minion Pro Bold (notice the
    thin joins of the <em>m</em>), not the normal version from which Michel extracted
    the -80 value. The display could be kerned tighter, perhaps.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps
    Optical Metrics is applied and the set size is very large. Not sure if the algorithm
    would kern it so tightly, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past it."

  body: "I have the bold display of Minion version 1.011 and the kerning is tighter,
    -88. If I put the optical kerning with InDesign CS3, I get -69. That does not
    change if I choose 72 points or 96 points.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/bold-display_6086.png\">\r\n\r\nMaybe
    some other combination of font version+application. Or maybe that is it.\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n\r\nHere
    is a scaled link (with width=100%) to the original picture of magic2101 for rapid
    comparison.\r\n <img src=\"/files/Ti%20ligature_0.jpg\" width=100%>\r\n\r\nThe
    font is different, but there is no way to compare with the original (that picture
    was a reconstruction). It looks like bold subhead, and the kerning I get is -83\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"/files/bold-subhead_4655.png\">\r\n\r\nNot tight enough."

  body: Is it the foundry font, or modified? I could get this without any kerning
    by making a modified font, having an extra dotless i with negative left sidebearing,
    and a {calt} feature...

  body: "Without modifying the font, and without using an explicit <code>\\kern</code>
    command, it can be done with luaLaTeX using a little file, say <code>Ti.fea</code>
    with the lines\r\n<PRE>\r\nlanguagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn dflt;\r\nfeature
    kern {\r\n      pos \\T \\dotlessi -115;\r\n} kern;\r\n</PRE>\r\nand then loading
    the font with the option <code>[FeatureFile=Ti.fea]</code>. That does not seem
    to interfere with the rest of the kerning.\r\n"

  body: "Well, here is something for Quark to beat. I did not find a way to make a
    <code>calt</code> table for lualatex, nor to simulate adding a table that does
    not exist in a font. There is at least a <code>salt</code> table in Minion Pro
    so here is another experiment. This time, I used a little file I called <code>salt.fea</code>
    with the following lines\r\n<PRE>\r\nlanguagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\n\r\nfeature salt {\r\n  script latn ;\r\n    language dflt ;\r\n
    \      sub \\i by \\dotlessi ;\r\n} salt ;\r\nfeature kern {\r\n script latn;\r\n
    \  language dflt ;\r\n      pos \\T \\dotlessi -115;\r\n} kern ;\r\n</PRE>\r\nI
    used it to define the fontface <code>\\head</code> in the following luaLaTeX file\r\n<PRE>\r\n\\documentclass{article}\r\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\r\n\r\n\\setromanfont{Minion
    Pro Bold Subh}\r\n\\newfontface\\head[FeatureFile=salt.fea,\r\n                  Style=Alternate]{Minion
    Pro Bold Subh}\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n{\\head Time} in Toronto\r\n\\end{document}
    \r\n</PRE>\r\nwhich gave the following output:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/timeintoronto_5104.png\">\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the \"font face\" <code>\\head</code> used to write \"Time\" is of little
    use but at least the word \"Time\" is properly coded, without cheating with an
    dotlessi in the input. The worst that can happen if <code>salt.fea</code> is used
    with a font that misses a <code>salt</code> table is that the output simply shows
    \"Ti\" instead of \"T\u0131\" which is exactly as should be.\r\n\r\n"
