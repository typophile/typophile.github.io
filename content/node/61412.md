  body: That's pretty close, but I don't think that's it. The serifs seem to be much
    more rounded in the Basterds-variant. This is a crappy cam screenshot, and one
    could assume the poor quality makes it seem rounded, but I also noticed the rounded
    serifs when I saw it at the cinema.

  body: 'that is most definitly the Friz no doubt. what they did was add a stroke
    with rounded edges and then added a copy layer which was then blurred to make
    it glow like that. then they stetched it vertically a bit and dropped the capitals
    below the baseline. try it yourself and find out. it will look exactly the same. '

    I am betting on Friz Quadrata."
