    Yes. Exactly. Hamburgerking even.\r\n\r\nAnd... What else would a frustrated production
    artist know better? \r\n\r\nPart of me is is thrilled at the mere possibility
    that something that ultra derivative could be a serious logo for them. I mean
    no more death star for one. And I think it is worth noticing - which logo do you
    read the most readily? There are real problems with the idea to be sure - it isn't
    nearly distinctive enough -  but on that level at least - it works better than
    the others."

    the death star.... very funny observation. And yes, this McAT&T logo does catch
    your eye right away even though it is ultimately flawed ... yet kinda fabulous.
    TMobile is the one I have serious problems with --- super boring! Perhaps the
    next frustrated production artist who is not resourceful enough to contact TMobile's
    branding department can invent his own take on their staid logo. And since TMobile
    is really Deutsche Telekom, why not a talking german bratwurst mobile phone? "

    out. You will end up unwittingly starting a school of logo design which says 'good
    logo design = sandwich shape'.  ;-)\r\n\r\nStill, there is clearly something to
    that...."
