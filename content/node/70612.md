  for a script font that might match this quick sketch of F:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f_from_falcons_6285.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  never attempted anything like this before, so drawing the letters myself is not
  a good option.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your help. Thanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The feather-like
  endings are easy to customize, of course. I'm more interested in the general shape
  of the rest."

    looking for.

    be possible to take a sporty script and featherize its \"brushes\" (those are
    ostensibly the foxy parts, but with suitable detailing they could perhaps be made
    to suggest feathers/wings, if that's what your intent is).\r\n"

  body: Nick, I'm not quite sure but I don't think he's necessarily looking for an
    outline/drop shadow... I inferred this was merely the shape of the "F" he was
    looking for, not necessarily with that kind of stylization already applied. Then
    again, I could be wrong. :)

  body: "Wow. Sorry I couldn't get back to this earlier. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, I'm not
    looking for an outline font or one that has the feather motif (mentioned that
    at the top). I probably should have mentioned \"Falcons\" refers to the athletic
    program at a school. They play soccer, basketball, and volleyball. \r\n\r\nSteven,
    I looked at Tangier before I posted, but it's shapes are too \"stylish\" for what
    I need, as if written with a pen, which is too formal for an athletic program.\r\n\r\nRiccardo,
    I'm not too fond of Sloe Gin Rickey...\r\n\r\nFrode, Bello is indeed an interesting
    option, but lacks \"sharpness,\" which would require quite a bit of customization.
    (Don't get me wrong, I'd love to do it, I just haven't attempted anything this
    extensive yet.)\r\n\r\nKent, Casey is the closest of the suggestions to what I
    had in mind. Love the capitals, but the lowercase again lacks sharpness. (That
    F is phenomenal, though!) I'll keep this one on the list. "

    at least more often than not)."

    nowadays (and hopefully that someone might be me). \r\n\r\nI think you should
    give it a try yourself, perhaps starting with a font that\u2019s close to what
    you want. Feel free to post a thread here, if you need advice! If you\u2019re
    completely new to type, my best advice is trying to understand how your shape
    would look drawn with the same tool as the other letters (thicks/thins/angles/terminals)
    and keeping your bezier points at extremes and handles at 90 degrees."
