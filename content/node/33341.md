  unit I could click the tracking arrow while holding the option key. I have tried
  every key combination with no luck. Surely Adobe doesn't want me to do it manually.
  Any ideas?\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHank"

  body: Actually, option (alt in Windows) goes by 20. This increment can be adjusted
    to any number in Preferences. I prefer to keep mine at 5.

  body: "Well here is what I have found that sort of works:\r\n\r\nIn Preferences/Units
    & Increments/Keyboard Increments you can adjust the amount of keyboard KERNING
    by 1/1000 of an em. \r\n\r\nBut in reality this preference increment works for
    for BOTH Kerning and Tracking using the Option and Arrow Keys.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    why they choose not to implement the option-mouse click to do the same thing."
