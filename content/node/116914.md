  can\u2019t use it for the body text, as my Wordpress template only allows me to
  have custom headers.\r\nFor the body text I can use the google fonts plus a basic
  set including Verdana, Arian, Lucida Sans and so on.\r\nI would prefer a sans serif
  for the body text. \r\nLet me know if there is one you can recommend.\r\nThanks,\r\nAntonie\r\n"

    has a calligraphic feel to it similar to Beorcana. \r\n\r\nI really can't think
    of a perfect sans-serif match available on Google Fonts. Open Sans and Source
    Sans Pro are always good choices and could really pair decently with anything.
    You can see some other choices here for nice Google fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typewolf.com/top-10-open-source-web-fonts\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps.\r\n\r\nJeremiah"

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\n@Jeremiah, I like Alegreya but actually find
    it a bit too caligraphic, thinking I'd like something with a simpler shape to
    go with Beorcana. And I had a look at the suggestions on typewolf, but I don't
    know enough about typography to make an informed choice as to which font would
    be a good match, especially since I'm waiting to buy Beorcana until I have a suitable
    matching body font.\r\n\r\n@hhp, my wordpress template (Avada) will in the future
    allow for custom body text, so in a way it would also be nice to hear suggestions
    for a matching body type that are not in Google fonts. I'm a writer who is building
    \ a website. I've just started learning about typography, and I read and write
    a lot, so I do have a sense of the importance of typography and its potential
    beauty - just not enough expertise to make an informed choice. That's why I'm
    asking here for advice. \r\n\r\nSo can people help out with suggestions - either
    Google fonts or another font I'll be able to use once Avada allows for custom
    body text?\r\n  \r\n"

    surprise that you have your eye on one day enjoying real choice in a body font.
    If/when that happens you might consider a face mentioned here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/116847\r\n\r\nBut
    in the meantime (and since I totally agree that Beorcana's strong flavor should
    be matched up with something more staid) what do you think of PT Sans?\r\nhttps://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thanks again hhp.\r\nPT Sans sounds like a good suggestion for while I'm
      stuck with Google fonts. I'm going to play around with the different font sized
      on the typecast website, to see which ones fit. It does strike me that PT Sans
      has a much higher x-height than Beorcana - does that matter when they are used
      as body and header respectively?\r\n\r\nI had already looked at the thread about
      alternatives to Optima, but my understanding is that Beorcana is mentioned as
      one of the alternatives to Optima, which I take to mean that the other alternatives
      mentioned may or may not go with Beorcana, depending... I'll have another look."

  body: "Although a comparable x-height is one way fonts can harmonize, I don't find
    that to be critical; in fact to me it's not even a particularly strong factor
    (although relative apparent size does have to be considered).\r\n\r\nI think Beorcana
    being an alternative to Optima actually means other such alternatives have a good
    chance of harmonizing with it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    now on Typecast and they go together beautifully. \r\nAnd I'll look at the Optima
