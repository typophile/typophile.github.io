  body: Boat lettering is notoriously difficult to id, as it&#39;s frequently handpainted.
    However, I think you&#39;ll get really close with <a href="http://www.signdna.com/v2/cart/product.php?cat_id=&amp;gp=&amp;prod_id=63">Big
    Medicine</a>. Props as usual to Mike Yanega for his very helpful <a href="http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg8.html">Script
    ID Guide</a>.
