body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/magazine_layout_5938.jpg]\r\nI love how
  this literary magazine utilizes image as a layout. The whole spread is given an
  antique-like feel. It's hard to tell in the scan, but the image used is scanned
  (or seems to be scanned it) in and used as a background texture for the layout.
  There is more than one spread like this in the book, and I found it very fitting
  that this particular type of image (texture) be in a literary magazine.."
