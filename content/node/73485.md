body: "Hey guys!\r\n\r\nWondering if you could ID what font is in this YouTube song.
  Note that the lyrics are a little profane, being as the song features the F-word.
  So I guess not for the faint of heart?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAV0XrbEwNc&has_verified=1\r\n\r\nThat's
  the video!\r\n\r\nAnd I was also wondering about the rules of the Type ID board.
  I always try to look on here to help someone out, but I feel like I post so much
  on the ID board without really helping anyone because I'm still honing my typography
  skills and can't ID most things. Is this okay? Will I go to Typophile hell for this?"
