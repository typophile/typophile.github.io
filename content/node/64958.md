body: "Can anyone identify this typeface? it's used in the masthead on the Book Cover
  Archive's website [[http://www.bookcoverarchive.com]]\r\n\r\nIn addition to that,
  could you suggest anything with similar characteristics (squared, squatty, thick,
  vintage-esque)?\r\n\r\nI've seen other letter forms like this but i can never rank
  them in terms of style or family so i don't know where to begin when researching
  other options/looks.\r\n\r\nThanks! :)\r\n\r\nPS\u2014 This is the only other specimen
  i've seen (maybe it's the same one?) that hits close to what i'm after:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.draplin.com/pics/identity01_04_redwing.gif]]\r\n(the
  black logo on the right with the centered type)."
