  thread]]: a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)|<em>Firefly</em>]]-related
  book.\u2002The two genres for the book are science fiction and Western, and I\u2019m
  wondering if there are fonts with a \u2018feel\u2019 in both directions.\r\n\u2003Don\u2019t
  need old-style figures, but I do need book and titling weights, an italic suitable
  for long runs of text, and a complementary alternate form\u2014a matching sans-serif,
  perhaps, or at least with a similar x-height and color, but readily distinguishable
  from the main text.\u2002I can fake small capitals if need be.\u2002The Gentium
  Book/Fontin combo I've tried [[http://typophile.com/files/Hanging Chinese.pdf|here]]
  doesn't work too well.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\u2003Also, is the Chinese font I\u2019ve
  used (MS MingLiU) the best choice, or can someone recommend a better Chinese titling
  font/weight?\u2002(I.e., a more calligraphic font, still in Song style.)\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "&emsp;Of those you've mentioned, only [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/|Dispatch]]
    is much of a text font, and it doesn't have an italic form.\r\n&emsp;I'll probably
    try for something \"standard\" like Jenson along with some suitable sans-serif.&ensp;But
    the new semester is well underway, and I'm behind on thesis work, so the book
    project is on the back burner for the nonce.\r\n\u2014Joel"
