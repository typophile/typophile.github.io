    your announcements.\r\n\r\nThe inaccuracies in your English are cute and amusing,
    and I find them quite attractive.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may want to consider the
    impression this is creating. "

  body: "So it is true that some people are smarter when they are silent, then when
    they speak :)\r\n\r\nThanks Nick, I'm not native English speaker nor I actually
    speak so often English daily. But I'm trying to use it in writing form.\r\n\r\nIt
    may sound funny cause thoughts are firstly \"made\" in Serbian and then (in many
    cases) literary translated to English (not from A to z, but the 90% of it).\r\n\r\nI'm
    aware what impression that might make to somebody and that in most cases it doesn't
    sound professional or business oriented or that people may find you not so serious
    as you're trying to be... \r\n\r\nI'll pay more attention in future on this, it
    is not so trite thing after all.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
