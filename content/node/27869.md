body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nRighty, I need suggestions. Looking for something clean, simple,
  yet in a way stylish and influencing. Possibly serif, but not ruling anything out
  yet. FL and ligatures will be used and I'm also thinking of knocking the i dots
  out. Do let me know if that isn't good practice.\r\n\r\nWill be using in a masthead
  on a blog which is like a magazine/issue type sort of blog so it has to look legible
  and decent on screen only.\r\n\r\nJust to let you know, I can use system fonts and
  fonts from the Adobe Font Folio only. Kinda skint right now. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    fonts now come standard with fl ligatures.\r\n\r\nWhat about Warnock?"
