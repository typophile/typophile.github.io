body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nSomeone sent me this sample this morning, and this seems to
  ring a bell from a past ID, which I can't find in the archives. The font looks like
  Bauhaus with some edited characters, but it also has rounded strokes. I seem to
  recall that Mike F. or Dav ID'd it as a freebie font, but I can't pin it down anywhere.
  Anyone know this one? Thanks, \r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "OK, never mind. I just found it in my notes for the Bauhaus Guide. It's called
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/alba.font\">Alba</a> from Font-a-Licious.\r\n\r\nI
    know it was ID'd here, and that's when I wrote down the note to add this to the
    Guide. (Which I still haven't done).\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    times, and at least several times by Mike F. I'm pretty sure one of those times
    was what I recalled.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
