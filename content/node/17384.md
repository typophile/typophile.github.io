  this one) that would remain at the top of the posting area in the General Discussion
  Board mainly to inform newcomers to the boards on how to get the most out of the
  typophile experience. I'm wondering:\r\n\r\n1) Is this a good idea?\r\n\r\n2)What
  are some standards you think should be recommended. Here are a couple i think there
  should be:\r\n\r\nA) Search before you post: many topic have been discussed before.
  Please use the search function before posting a new thread to see if the subject
  you're interested in has already been covered.\r\n\r\nB) Image guidelines: Images
  MUST be in RGB format and should not exceed certain dimensions (what dimensions
  should those be? you tell me!)\r\n\r\nSo, post here with what you think our community
  guidelines should be. (Or if there are already some in place, please point me to
  them!) Thnx for looking.\r\n\r\n***Update: the guidelines can be found at http://typophile.com/readme"

    the place where people do their posts. Here is the one from Typographica:\r\n\r\n\"Please
    refrain from off-topic banter and personal attacks. Your comment may be edited
    or removed at the discretion of Typographica editors. Our goal is not to stifle
    debate but to keep it relevant.\"\r\n\r\nI would not want the stuff about refraining
    from off-topic banter, though. In good Talmudic style, some of the best stuff
    on Typophile happens when people go off on a tangent and people join in the discussion
    of it. A little irrelevant humor is welcome also. \r\n\r\nAnd the policing warning
    is not a necessity. Typophile is so active that it is probably unreasonable to
    ask volunteers to police it. But if the notice is there, then a firm warning from
    a moderator, and a very rare after-the-fact removal with an explanation might
    be healthy also.  "

    without scrolling. 600 (the size for Type Battle) seems a reasonable suggestion

    Typophile -although inescapably leaning towards certain cultures- is more like
    a zoo than a cocktail party, and the animals are from all over the planet. Ergo,
    don't assume, and certainly don't insist, that others take offense from the same
    things. That's just provincial. William's Talmudism or my Agnoticism should not
    impede candor. We pay politicians for that.\r\n\r\nWithout adding that to your

    would be preferable to \"illegal\", because in some countries there is no \"legal\"
    basis to the act of \"font theft\" or \"unauthorized sharing of software\", no
    actual state laws or legislation relating directly to it.\r\n\r\nThe only real
    standard for this kind of thing is the commercial nature of font vending and the
    moral outrage of type makers and vendors whose commercial rights are violated.
    For example, a user who breaches the terms and conditions of a font product's
    EULA makes illicit use of the product, but there may be no legal redress to their
    behaviour, depending on which country we're talking about.\r\n\r\nIt may be wise
    to put in a statement dealing with the \"unauthorized distribution or sharing\",
    breach of EULA and the <strong>commercial rights</strong> of authorized vendors.\r\n\r\nj

    I'd recommend that it say \"that\" instead of \"which.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, remember
    that non-commercial fonts are still copyrighted. We could look at what Wikipedia

    sites or resources offering unauthorized downloads of fonts, either free or commercial.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    may seem trivial to some people, but Thomas has good point about \"that\" v.s
    \"which\". It's a very fine point in English grammar.\r\n\r\nI've avoided it altogether
    with \"offering\".\r\n\r\nGlad you guys care.\r\n\r\nYep, some basic google tips
    on searching would be invaluable.\r\n\r\nWhile I think of it, the max image width
    of 600px still causes scrollbars to appear in Internet Explorer, so I've adopted
    590px for max width. I'm not allowed to look at Typophile on Macs at work. so
    can Safari users please post some feedback on max image width? What's the maximum
    width image you can post before scrollbars show up?\r\n\r\nThanks :^)\r\n\r\nj

    had a campaign to distinguish between \"that\" and \"which\". The idea is that
    you should use \"that\" when the clause defines or identifies that which comes
    before: \"The assassination that triggered the First World War.\" But when you
    are expanding on the previous, then you use \"which\": \"Romney's speech on religion,
    which was highly controversial.\"\r\n\r\nThere is some debate about how valid
    this rule is, but I think it's helpful.  "

    teachers in the United States but has never been widely adopted in Britain. It''s
    a bit artificial, in my opinion, since it''s sort of an arbitrary creation - as
    if I were to say "people should only use the word ''desktop'' to refer to computer
    interface spaces and never use it to refer to a piece of furniture", and then
    expect everyone to obey me - but people complain about violations anyway. '

  body: "<p>This has been a long time coming. It\u2019s old, but much of it still
    applies, and I am truly amazed at how people are still making the same mistakes
    we made a decade ago. Taken from <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html\">Jakob
    Nielsen\u2019s Alertbox, October 3, 2005: Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a>.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n2.
    Non-Standard Links  Following are the five main guidelines for links:\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Make obvious what\u2019s clickable: for text links, use colored, underlined text
    (and don't underline non-link text).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Differentiate visited and
    unvisited links.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Explain what users will find at the other end of
    the link, and include some of the key information-carrying terms in the anchor
    text itself to enhance scannability and search engine optimization (SEO). <strong>Don\u2019t
    use \u201Cclick here\u201D or other non-descriptive link text</strong>.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques
    for dealing with links.\r\n\r\nIn particular, don\u2019t open pages in new windows
    (except for PDF files and such).</p> <p>Links are the Web's number one interaction
    element. Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse
    and delay users, and might prevent them from being able to use your site.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nFor
    example, instead of linking \u201CI just came across an interesting Kickstarter
    project. For more information, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">click
    here</a>\u201D (which provides the user with no information as to where they are
    going to end up without additionally reading the words around the ambiguous word
    \u201Chere,\u201D try:\r\n\r\nI was doing a bit of reading, and I came across
    <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">an
    interesting Kickstarter project: Gremolata & Cancellaresca Milanese</a>. A graphic
    design project in new York, NY, by Russell Maret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>Those who

    a Typophile thread \u201CPLEASE READ: Typophile Forum Posting Guidelines\u201D</a>
