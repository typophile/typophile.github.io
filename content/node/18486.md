  one understands me, perhaps you could provide me some sort of moral backup... Recently
  I designed a hardcover book for a major Polish publishing house; the design was
  rather ascetic. Its crucial feature was the size of white margins around a photo
  used on the cover: the margins are narrow (4 mm) and should be as equal as possible.
  You can see the idea in first attachment. Second attachment shows the result - I
  have just received the printed and binded book: margins are anything but equal,
  whole balance of the design is lost. Gosh, I haven't been that disappointed in ages.\r\n\r\nDo
  you have similar problems in your countries? Can you design with confidence that
  your ideas that require extreme precision won't be spoiled? Or maybe I expect too
  much?\r\n\r\nI would welcome any comments.\r\n\r\nPrzemek Debowski"

    things, you get good results from good craftsman but you must be sure they know
    your intentions.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I suspect this kind of thing happens all the time, everywhere.\r\nThe following
    advice is based on my experience as a freelance, designing book covers for  publishers
    in Canada.\r\nTo guard against cock-ups, you have to embed yourself into the workflow
    at key points.\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\n1. Signing off on proofs. The publisher's
    in-house art department has the ability to mess around with your artwork, so you
    have to state up-front that you want to OK the final proofs, before they go to
    the printer. Put it in your contract that this is included in services rendered.
    Otherwise a publisher will not bother asking you to check small changes, because
    your time is valuable, and they think so highly of you.\r\nIdeally, the final
    proof should be a mocked-up cover, on a dummy (provided to the publisher from
    the bindery, via the printer), so that if the finished piece is wrong, the publisher
    (who is paying the bills) will be able to wave it at the printer and say \"but
    this is what I signed off on, please do it again and get it right.\"\r\n\r\n2.
    Press Approval. This will of course be scheduled for 4 a.m. to discourage you
    from showing up and creating a nuisance. At the approval, don't give a hasty approval.
    Think about it, make them wait. \r\n"

    blame the artwork. \r\nI always send a full mock-up to the printers and have them
    approve the artwork before they run anything.\r\nNot much consolation but you
    have gained an experience.\r\nTim"
