  Anyone with better ideas?"

  body: Well, this is a pre-digital typeface, so chances are likely that this exact
    rendition of the typeface never made it to a digital font. Do you need the closest
    digital alternative, or do you just want a name?

  body: Not exactly; the tops of the curves are rounder and heavier. The numerals
    are definitively Compacta.

    digital alternative\u2019 part.\r\nCompacta? Indeed! I always forget about that
    one. Should use <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts/\">your
    lists</a> more often \u2026"

  body: I agree with Compacta  for the numerals, and Helvetica Extra Compressed (although
    it could have been slightly more compressed) seems indeed a close match for the
    name, Helvetica being, I presume, the original to Swiss. Thanks a lot for your
    help!
