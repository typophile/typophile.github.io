body: "-- edit --\r\nI've added a better sample, per Paul's comment.\r\n--\r\n\r\nI've
  done a lot of typographic design, logotype lettering, and all that, but this is
  my first commissioned font. that said, you would hope I gave it plenty of incubation
  time -- not so. hopefully you'll be kind enough to give me some direction for beta
  release two.\r\n\r\nthe type is for a consumer catalog, that averages around six
  products per page, and favors filling the space as much as possible with image.
  it was to replace a very good titling script that had become the scape goat for
  other issues. the brief was to create something that was more readable and economical
  than a script, and it was suggested that it not be anything too \"wierd\". the biggest
  hurdle was that I had about two weeks of \"free-time\" to complete one weight and
  style that would be put to immediate use. to assist in my expediency, I started
  with series of drawings I had been working on for educational purposes -- something
  quite traditional, fortunately.\r\n\r\nI completed the font on time, and to great
  acceptance by the decision-makers on the project. the trouble is, the quality is
  not what I would like it to be (especially in terms of spacing), so I've been doing
  a lot of hand-work in it's use.\r\n\r\nI have some time now to re-address the type,
  but I'd like some solid feedback before I start messing around. any opinions would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i don't think we can give a truly effective critique without seeing some text
    set in the typeface. can we get another sample showing some words set using the
    font?

    I think it needs more its own identity. \r\n\r\nThe one thing strikes me as out
    of place is that the right stem of the U is thick when the rest of the face follows
    the usual thick/thin rules. "

  body: "<cite>this looks to me an awful like you modified Perpetua</cite>\r\n\r\nthat's
    exactly where my earlier study began. oddly enough, it's also one of the reference
    faces the approval commitee liked. Perpetua had many of the features they were
    looking for, but it didn't fit with the overall needs in many ways.\r\n\r\none
    of the things that troubles me is though it works better for the client, I still
    much perfer Perpetua. I suppose trumping Gill is a foolish goal for any of us,
    lest of all an amateur!\r\n\r\n<cite>one thing strikes me as out of place is that
    the right stem of the U</cite>\r\n\r\nabsolutely! I actually hadn't looked at
    it much---it's one of the characters I spent next to zero time with, since it
    doesn't occur much in our use."

  body: "<cite>I think it needs more its own identity</cite>\r\n\r\nhow do you mean?
    does it just retain too much of the Perpetua/Gill influence, or is my hand conflicting
    with Gill's and creating an disunified type?"

  body: 'Yes, retains too much of Perpetua. If it were me I would want a different
    enough concept to justify the work that will be needed to complete it--as well
    as a reason for others to use it rather than Perpetua. If you started with Perpetua''s
    outlines, there may also be legal problems, as Monotype Imaging''s EULA doesn''t
    allow modification. '

    fontplayer! you're absolutely right about the customer. besides, I figure they'll
    be looking for something new within the year anyway. I was just concerned about
    developing my own skills.\r\n\r\n<cite>If it were me I would want a different
    enough concept to justify the work</cite>\r\n\r\nquite true. I'd like to get it
    back to paper (where I'm more comfortable) for some more analysis. is there any
    pervasive quality you can put into words that screams Perpetua to you?\r\n\r\n<cite>If
    you started with Perpetua\u2019s outlines</cite>\r\n\r\nactually I started with
    it on paper. I was trying to think through Gill's reasoning by drawing the characters
    exactly as he had first. I then went back and attacked it with Perpetua nowhere
    in sight. once I had a good selection of characters down, I went into FLS5 to
    get a feel for the digitization process.\r\n\r\nthat was all mostly just an excercise,
    but it happened to fit the bill on this project.\r\n\r\nfor this version, I picked-up
    my drawings and matched Gill's stem width (I liked their weight on the page).
    I then proceded to touch up my outlines and spacing for use around 40 points."
