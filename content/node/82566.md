  body: "After hunting at MyFonts and in my Script Font ID Guide, my feeling is that
    these are 'home made' fonts, done my an average person, or at least made convincingly
    average-looking. I made a list of nine fonts that could be used for the lower
    case font, and three of them come from the old ClickArt Handwritten Fonts CD still
    sold with Broderbund collections: Beatty, Lebanon and Mook. Others that are commercial
    fonts are: Mohawcs Note, Printhouse (from House General Collection), ITC Zemke
    Hand, Casino Hand, Sweet Pea and <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/gapstown-ah.font\">Gapstown
    AH</a> (a freebie from Fontgrube, who sometimes appears here).\r\n\r\nFor the
    all caps letters, there is a sort of forced control here, as if someone who is
    not a professional is trying hard to make their neatest letters, but couldn't
    go to the trouble of using guidelines (hence the varied heights). I thought Langer
    or Layout might be similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
