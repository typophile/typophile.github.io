  be great if you could type in the text form of it so I could copy and paste it for
  something I am making. I currently only have this image of it so I can not re type
  it.\r\n\r\n<img>http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/387790_10150513826898162_604438161_10276104_1016450666_n.jpg</img>\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    forgot to say, the language is Mandarin Chinese. It appears to be a title of a

  body: "Yes, I recognize that as a four-character idiom*.\r\n\r\nI'm a little rusty,
    but I'll give it a shot.\r\n\r\nLiteral: The warm spring weather brings forth
    flower blossoms.\r\nAlso used to convey something like... \"A good opportunity
    presents itself\", often used in the context of work.\r\n\r\n*Four-character idioms,
    or ch\xE9ngy\u01D4 (Traditional Chinese: \u6210\u8A9E; Simplified Chinese: \u6210\u8BED,
    literally \"to become (part of) the language\") are widely used in Classical Chinese,
    a literary form used in the Chinese written language from antiquity until 1919,
    and are still commonly used in Vernacular writing today.  ([[http://www.chinese-tools.com/chinese/chengyu|Source]])"
