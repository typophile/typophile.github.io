    Strange attractors did great with \"little yellow writing hood\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat

  body: I thought the Typophile Film Fest was great! There were some interesting films,
    and Little Yellow Riding Hood was probably the highlight. Of course, Ed Benguiat's
    video clip from Brazil tonight was hilarious as well! Good fun!
