  body: In Photoshop, you can adjust the rasterization mode of type (Crisp, Sharp,
    Smooth, etc.), which comes in handy when optimizing the appearance of bitmap images.

  body: If it's going to be an attachment (as opposed to being viewed in the body
    of the email) put it together in InDesign and then export as a pdf. Generally
    speaking doing the whole thing as a bitmap will make the file unnecessarily large,
    and the text would look ropey when viewed at anything other than 100% zoom.
