body: 'I&#39;m trying to create a kind of ornament font that uses reverse upper/lower
  letters in a rounded rectangle. This is for two-letter language codes for our labeling.
  I&#39;ve created a bunch of custom fonts before, which contained my own drawings
  as characters. However now I need to create this font to look like our existing
  Myriad Pro text. <BR> <BR>I only need Upper/lower A-Z for this, plus [] and &#40;&#41;.
  These will look like this: <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/36178.jpg"
  alt="How it should look"> <BR> <BR>This corresponds to: <BR>English language/Great
  Britain <BR>French/France <BR>Hellenica &#40;Greek&#41;/Greece <BR>Japanese/Japan
  <BR>etc... <BR> <BR>Are there open-source/free font designs that I can use that
  are somewhat similar to the Myriad Pro Bold Condensed font I used for these? I don&#39;t
  want to use Adobe&#39;s outlines &#40;like I did for this illustration&#41; so that
  we don&#39;t have to worry about this font for internal company work. <BR> <BR>Is
  the best solution to just draw the entire font myself? I am just using the alphabet
  as a basis for the font I&#39;ll be creating, but I don&#39;t want to step on other
  people&#39;s design for my base glyphs, I only want to base the font on glyphs that
  I have the proper permission to derive my font from. <BR> <BR>Clear as mud?'

    target="_blank">This</a> could work. <BR>Whatever you decide, consider decreasing
    the ascender/descender heights in the lower case. It will allow you to center
    the cap combinations in the boxes better while still leaving room for fr and ja
    to be nicely centered. <BR> <BR>Randy
