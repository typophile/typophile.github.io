  Best Picture nominees. It's a self initiated project I did just for fun (and, of
  course, practice) and would like to hear some comments & critique if you find the
  time! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/All_index_6182.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "I really like these. They'd be really great on a voting website, as some
    Oscar party-throwers have.\r\n\r\nI'd stick to the script type for the titles
    and stick to red-black-gray; it's very classy (the green kind of sticks out).\r\n\r\nThe
    help and extremely loud could use more work; they don't have the elegance of the
    other treatments.\r\n\r\nBut, hey, doing logo sets is one of the rougher tasks
    in graphics."
