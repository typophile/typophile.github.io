    before. The g &#40;assuming it&#39;s not a percentage sign&#41; isn&#39;t getting
    me any closer, though. <BR> <BR>How about a clue?

    <BR> <BR>Nah I was just being silly, joking with the &#34;Big Caslon&#34;  <BR>name.
    If you&#39;re considering purchasing a license  <BR>for Big Caslon, keep in mind
    that it&#39;s a display face  <BR>intended to be used at large sizes &#40;hence
    the name  <BR>&#34;Big Caslon&#34;&#41;. If printed at text sizes the serifs will  <BR>become
    too thin and disappear.
