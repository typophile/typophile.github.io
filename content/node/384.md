  Gothic has the potential to be a very useful system. While simple, it&#39;s a modular
  face that can be modified to no end. I use these faces, especially the top one,
  for basic chores. <BR> <BR>This particular system calls out a width and height and
  a stem width. Grid Gothic 991 is made on a 9X9 grid with a stem of 1. It&#39;s black
  value is 81 &#40;9X9/1&#41;. &#40;The higher the number, the lighter the face.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>GG662 has a value of 18 &#40;6X6/2&#41;, GG 733 has a value of 7. You can
  get darker than 7, but you have to fudge a bit. <BR> <BR>What I was proposing was
  that Grid Gothic become a tester or a guinea pig for the Typophile Team Dynamics
  idea. <BR> <BR>Everybody, newbies and veterans, can make these faces if they have
  access to Illustrator. <BR> <BR>The faces can be brought together into a family.
  <BR> <BR>Once you get a basic grid down, you can elaborate. Example No. 4. <BR>
  <BR>First, maybe within a week, anyone interested would let the Team Leader know
  with a post or email and what weights they&#39;d like to attempt. Then the Leader
  could make the dummy files to work from. &#40;If the grid isn&#39;t done right,
  when it is United, it will leave gaps&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would think that Jared or
  Joe should Team Leader. I would not want to do it, but I&#39;ll contribute these
  three as a start. <BR> <BR>I think that Jared or Joe might have some good ideas
  on what to do with the family once it&#39;s finished. &#40;bandwith$&#41; <BR> <BR>There
  are some other points to talk about &#40;spacing, etc.&#41; and some things I&#39;m
  leaving out. <BR> <BR> If anyone&#39;s online now, feel free to discuss. <BR> <BR>If
  there&#39;s not enough interest, I will keep the concept, though it&#39;s on the
  back burner. <BR> <BR>bj '
