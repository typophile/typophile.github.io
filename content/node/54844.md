  question I\xB4m asking it\xB4s not typography related, but here it goes anyway.\r\n\r\nI\xB4ve
  designed a small book (it was my graduation course thesis) about typeface legibility
  and readability, and I would like to know if anyone knows about any company that
  offers services on very short runs of book printing and binding? \r\n\r\nI live
  in Portugal, so the company must have a shipment service to Portugal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much. "

    [[http://www.acmebook.com/|Acme Bookbinding]] near Boston will give more personalized
    service. \r\nBoth can ship internationally, but to a book printer, anything under
    1000 copies is a very short run. If you plan to print several hundred copies,
    you may prefer to print them in Europe to avoid a very slow and/or expensive delivery.
    [[http://www.integratedbook.com/index1.html|IBT Global]] has a facility in London."

    with english, order from a US on demand provider. They do a pretty good job and
    shipping is a wonder of the 21st century. You can foofle all the info out the
    internet.\r\n\r\nSalud! (y fuerza al canut)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
