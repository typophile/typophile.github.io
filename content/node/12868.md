  body: it looks to me like you have it set up right. the name of the group is not
    important (the "A1" portion). I don't know why it's not working in FLab, but if
    you export the font does it work?

    have to see the same width on each composited accented characters? Actually, on

    it's not right. That's why I do not export my font. \r\n\r\nTerminal design: Yes
    I use Tools>Kerning Assistance and select the right and left kern classes to generate

  body: maybe this is only a feature in FLab 5? I tried to set up some kerning classes
    in FL 4.6 and it didn't work for me either. but maybe we're just missing a step?
    can anyone help?

  body: "Classes can be tricky. I'll tell you how I do it, then I'll add what doesn't
    seem to work.\r\n\r\nFor your A class, I will set up a class called <strong>_KERN_A_CAP</strong>,
    and in the classes panel it will look like this: <strong>_KERN_A_CAP: A' Aacute
    Acircumflex Adieresis Agrave Aring Atilde Abreve Amacron Aogonek</strong>. \r\n\r\nThen
    in the opentype panel you have to also add a string so that the OT features know
    about that class. (Apparently this can be done automatically, but I do it by hand.)
    There you write the class like this: <strong>@_KERN_A_CAP = [A Aacute Acircumflex
    Adieresis Agrave Aring Atilde Abreve Amacron Aogonek];</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are
    a few things to keep in mind. One is that you cannot have a space after the semicolon.
    Another is don't forget to remove the mark after you add the key glyph in the
    OT panel. The third is not to put the same glyph in more than one class of the
    right or left groups. I.e., don't reuse glyphs in different classes from FL. You
    can probably do this if you're using Adobe FDK to generate fonts, but I have no
    idea how to do this. From FL, it just seems to mess things up.\r\n\r\nAnother
    note about the left versus right classes. It's important to remember that Right
    classes are the ones that go on the right, not that kern on the right. So if you
    want to kern everything like Ta, To, Tq, etc, then the class containing a o and
    q will be a right class. As I'm sure you know, you make a class a right class
    by checking it off in the Kerning Assistance dialogue box. (Don't forget to check
    on \"Apply and Save\" every time you change the kerning, or the changes will not
    be made in the OT features.)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
