    we're dealing with two different fonts?"

  body: "Your second sample looks like <strong>[[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Rodeo.htm|Rodeo
    Light]]</strong> by A.Kustov [TypeMarket, 1993] now available from ParaType, which
    is actually very close to <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Monotype&ffam=Rockwell%20Light%20-%20Regular&fid=a5c8e98451732210d1c6e10cc708c1e3&fsize=60&text=SUBWAY%20ART%20An%20Owl%20Book%20Company&wrap=2|Rockwell

  body: "Memphis is my guess for the Henry Holt imprint--given the book is from the
    80s.\r\n\r\nRockwell Light predates the age of digital type, so it's your best
    bet for the other sample--again, given when the book was published, the font needs
    to date from the phototypesetting era."
