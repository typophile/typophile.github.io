  body: "It's a little too small in your JPG to tell for sure. \r\n\r\nAre the letterforms
    smooth? You could try [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/typewriter-serial/|Typewriter
    Serial]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/|Bulletin
    Typewriter]], or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/matthias-luh/typewriter-revo/|Typewriter
    Revo]].\r\n\r\nIs it distressed/corroded? I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/john-doe/|John
