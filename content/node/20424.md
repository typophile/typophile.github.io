  musical Wicked? It was the same font that was used on the cover of the novel. I
  can't seem to find anything that's very close.\r\n\r\nHere's the musical poster:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wicked3_4575.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "\"WICKED\" looks custom, probably modified from a pre-existing font. It's
    just too messy; the serifs aren't consistent, odd widths, the letters don't lie
    straight on the baseline, and the C looks like a modified O.\r\n\r\n\"A New Musical\"
    and \"The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz\" is set in [[squooshed]] <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.106993.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=74&sampleText=A+NEW+MUSICAL&sampleSize=32\">Amigo</a>

  body: Judging from a larger image sample on the <a href="http://www.wickedthemusical.com/">official
    website</a>, I'd say it's definitely custom. I can't be sure whether they started
    with a font or drew from scratch but if I had to guess, I'd say the former.

  body: The iconic "Wicked"  lettering is a typeface released in 1889 called "Nero".  Similar
    styles of fonts came on the scene through the late 1890's like Rubens, Makart,
    Othellow, Mexican, and a few others.
