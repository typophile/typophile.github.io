  know how \"muscle car\" fans get with their vehicles, he wants to personalize it
  with a cutted vinyl phrase on the windshield, I'm a Typo Freak, so if I'm doing
  this, I'm gonna do it the right way, and that means with the right typeface...\r\n\r\nHere's
  the logo:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DodgeCharger_3695.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  hope that this font even exist, or some similar font will do the job...\r\n\r\n"

    from the chrome lettering \"badge\" off the side of the car.\r\n\r\nThe windshield
    graphics look like they are set in Freeline Cruiser from T-26."
