What a kind of challenge is this one supposed to be? Weak, weak, weak. Too boring even for pretend consideration. Also try: spam fritters, war stories, teling people "Eh gah, it were all different in my day lad."

lol - a 'Withnail & I' fan James? One of my all time faves.

Definitely Papyrus. I have seen some decent food packaging with Papyrus recently - much to my sheer astonishment. I will try and find it but I can't even remember what it was.

Here's another five...

You’re in the basement of the Linotype office when a fire breaks out (don't look at me). You can only rescue two sets of original drawings, what do you save?

You’re in a bar when a fight breaks out between Meta and Avenir. Which one do you clock with a half empty vodka bottle?

The US font foundries are about to go out of business (due to some font embedding scheme that went awry) – if you were the US government which one would you bail out?

You have a fox, a chicken, a row boat, a copy of InDesign CS 4, and a 1200dpi laser printer. How do get them all across the river?

A train leaves Chicago at 8am, and another leaves St Louis at 10am – which font gets to Los Angeles first.

Blow up the bitch with the firecracker smile. Sorry I can't take that one seriously.

None of them. They are all corrupt and not worth saving. If anything, I would buy up shares or assets in each foundry at the fire sale, take control of all companies, and sink them into oblivion.

Oh don't be so ridiculous. Tolerate it and resist the urge to retaliate or at least suppress what he is saying. Then you and others won't be goaded into incivility and the hijacking is prevented by stopping the escalation of childish ad hominem personal remarks.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I'm complaining about David Berlow's ego, which takes the form of intolerant humour. David is being his usual egotistical self, and he has on many other occasions made ad hominem personal attacks on perfectly innocent people who become victims of his vitriol.

<em>I believe Randy was just being curious and not attacking David.</em>

Exactly! I thought the same thing about Randy, but it seems David must make something of it and retaliate with his silly egotistical personal attack.

Try and see my use of the word "intolerance" in color, or at least shades of gray, rather than black & white. I'm not using the word in a cut 'n dried sense.

I made a joke about your absurd egotism, which itself (the ego) is not very funny. Did you catch that one?

		<div class="commentbody">David, if you and others here could quote each other with typographic clarity it would avoid many errors of judgement and save me from having to make stupid ill-concieved jokes about them.

This utter debacle is partly a reflection of my reading skills when in a hurry, and partly a reflection of your skills as a text typographer. That's criticism and an explanation of what <em>really happened</em>, and not really intended as an ad hominem personal attack on you.

Interpret that however you like. I apologize for my screwing up and making stupid jokes about you and your ego.

The praise I recently voiced for Sii was for Sii as a person, and has nothing to do with wanting to work for Microsoft. Taking up such a position with Microsoft is now impossible for me since my post-aneurysm memory dropouts have made me virtually unemployable.

Tiffany&#8212;now would be a good time to cut the cards. Stop it from escalating further. Don't let me or David hijack this thread.

I'd go for the Comic Sans. It's more practical. I'd type low level encrypted messages, put them in bottles and toss the into the sea. That would be the most fun available to me on that deserted island.
