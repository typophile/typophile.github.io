  body: "looks cool. here's my two cents:\r\n\r\nthe S looks like it needs to be heavier
    and wider at the bottom. your E seems upside-down and the inside stroke is a little
    thin. The B is looking a little small (could be a bit wider). to make it more
    balanced, you might want to match the counters of the B to the those of the O,D,N,
    and G.\r\n\r\na good resource (that someone recently told me about) is:\r\n\r\n<a

    happen if you made the middle stroke as long as or longer than the top and bottom
    strokes?"

  body: Its boring. Mark Simonson has an article in general forums about "a cleaver
    use of a g" You might look at that article and see if it stimulates you to try
    something creative.

  body: "You might try making your N less wide. It distracts me.\r\n\r\nDan - That's
    pretyy heavy eh?  I would agree that it isn't Sooooo distictive as yet. A nifty
    G might be a good way to fix that."

  body: Flip that B! And while the miniscule "N" is unique and all, it doesn't make
    a ton of sense. It's not a "traditional" unicase with that majuscule "E".

    don't worry, the logo as a whole isn't finished yet. The obnoxious parts are in
    the works."

  body: Here's a revised version. i made the the middle stroke of the 'e' and the
    n's stems a bit fatter. i also made the b wider and its counters a bit bigger.
    what do you think? (I put the attachments in the first post in this discussion,
    as i couldn't figure out how to put it in this one)

    version of flash (8?) installed. It works. See?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flipdot.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    think it's getting better. The N does not distrart as much now. BTW Why Bison?
    Your letter shapes remind me of Jeremy tankard's stuff. Intentional? But his n
    is set in a more modern feeling face. Your B E and N seem to be pulling in differfent
    directions. What are you getting at with this combination? It seems hodge-podgy.
    But maybe I don't get it. Can you explain? "
