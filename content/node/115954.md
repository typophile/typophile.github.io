  oddly familiar. Actually, though, what with Times Roman being derived from Plantin,
  and Caslon being based upon the Dutch types that were popular before it, a modernized
  Caslon, such as Recut Caslon and New Caslon from ATF, is bound to resemble Times
  Roman at least a little."

    a bunch of paper with ink stains? Furthermore, you've already let an 80-year-old
    man beat you to the punch, so to speak, and you ain't ever started to draw. ;p

  body: "I'm not saying that people shouldn't <em>use</em> Starling; I would have
    thought the idiomatic meaning of the title of my post was clear: here is something
    that even further predates Times Roman and yet looks like it.\r\n\r\nExcept, of
    course, 1904 came before 1911... so this mistake on my part obscures what I was
    thinking. However, whatever sources Morison may have had, this face is presumably
    an independent development from Caslon, in no way influenced by the submission
    from W. B. Starling to Lanston Monotype."

    this face,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ant_rom_5980.jpg]\r\n\r\nAntique
    Roman, looks a lot more like Bookman than the face generally credited as its inspiration,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/osa_tw_6234.jpg]\r\n\r\nOld
    Style Antique.\r\n\r\nEDIT: But on the very next page, there's a different Antique
    Old Style which looks more like Bookman, although I still think less so than Antique
    Roman:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aos_hwc_4502.jpg]\r\n\r\nOh,
    and here's a more extended sample of Stephenson Blake's Old Style No. 5, where
    in continuous text the resemblance thereof, or lack of same, to the Times' New
    Roman may be better judged:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/os5_sb_5423.jpg]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I tried that face in What The Font, and the result I got was a face I had never
    heard of, Casad. And there was definitely a resemblance, at least in the lowercase
    j.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Casad is much more condensed than this."

    Caslon worked so long before anyone in this story, I'm not sure how he could *not*
    have had an effect on Morrison, Burgess, Wyse, S&B, Monotype, Times, and Starling.

  body: 'To me, the design DNA of Times New Roman is a quite pronounced backward leaning
    stress (old style stress) in the lower case, especially on the c and e, combined
    with high contrast and lapidary serifs. Those are the very sharp serifs one sees
    in stone carving. I don''t think any of the examples you give really have that
    DNA. '

  body: "<cite>I'm only privy to what you've written, not what you're thinking.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    of course. However, writing is a tool used to express thought. And thoughts are
    sometimes expressed in writing in a fashion that, although indirect, is still
    transparent.\r\n\r\nSometimes, of course, attempts at subtlety fall flat.\r\n\r\n<cite>Caslon
    worked so long before anyone in this story, I'm not sure how he could *not* have
    had an effect on Morrison, Burgess, Wyse, S&B, Monotype, Times, and Starling.</cite>\r\n\r\nOh,
    indeed. And, of course, Times New Roman, Caslon, and even Bembo and Eusebius all
    express the same twenty-six letters.\r\n\r\nAs we do remember, though, William
    Burgess Starling is said to have designed a typeface in 1904 that eerily anticipates
    Times Roman. Some unfortunate problems involving asbestos have interfered with
    examining some of the evidence for that claim.\r\n\r\nSince Times Roman is basically
    a sharpened-up Plantin, and Plantin was a revival, as its name indicates, of course
    it did not spring without precedent from the brow of Zeus. Even Venus had Franklin
    Gothic before it...\r\n\r\nEven so, because Caslon, very much like Times Roman,
    was a typeface that enjoyed great popularity because it was sharp, and it was
    an English typeface designed in a milieu of widespread usage of the Dutch types
    which included the prototype for Plantin, the various modifications and imitations
    of Caslon are a naturally likely spot to look in to see if someone, before Starling,
    anticipated Times Roman just as closely. And more publicly.\r\n\r\nThis might,
    or might not, free Stanley Morison from the charge of plagiarism. But it would
    have at least some impact on the question of whether Starling was the \"real\"
    inventor of Times Roman.\r\n\r\n<cite>I don't think any of the examples you give
    really have that DNA.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs a point of clarification, just in case:
    Antique Roman, Antique Old Style and Old Style Antique were presented for comparison
    with <em>Bookman</em>. Only Lining Old Style No. 5, presented in two of the examples,
    was intended for comparison with Times Roman.\r\n\r\nThe letters b, c, d, p and
    q have some slight reverse stress, now that you mention it, but that might be
    nothing new; and o, for example, certainly doesn't have any."
