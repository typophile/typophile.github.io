  \r\n\r\nClass project. Logo is for a new (made up) hybrid car company. The name
  unity shows the mingling of the gas and electric power of the cars. The type is
  something i drew and then scanned and cleaned up in illustrator. This is my first
  logo/identity that ive done!\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/coments/critique/ripping me
  a new one/ are welcome! I want to learn and get better! Thanks for your time!"

  body: There's something off in the transitions from staight to curve in the actual
    logo, and in the logotype the I and T are too dark. The TY connection is also
    a bit awkward, and the bowl of the Y feels a bit odd as well. I'm not completely
    sold on the type, but the logo itself is a strong start. However, at a small size
    the logo (on its own) may begin to look like an @ glyph. For a first shot at an
    identity design this is strong work.

  body: You might also make the N taller. The curved N looks shorter that the other
    characters although mechanially correct. This is a case where you have to compensate
    optically.

    that. But other than that, nice start. One thing- I''m bugged by the hole between
    the I and the T. '

  body: Like the above statements I feel that you need to refine the logotype before
    you start trying to present it with a mark as a brand. Good start though, heed
    the suggestions you get here. :)

  body: "Nice work nebrow I really like the way you conceptualized the overall theme
    of the brand, however I wanted to share two quick opinions I have from a purely
    psychological point of view.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I am not completely sold on the idea
    of using an oblique typeface for the branding of a car manufacturer. Aside from
    Range Rover I can't think of many automotive brands that make use of oblique typefaces.
    You really need to consider the characteristics of the cars the company would
    be selling. Perhaps if the cars were really fast you could use a heavily italicized
    typeface to insinuate speed but the typeface you're using is neither here nor
    there. Personally I think the type would be stronger if it wasn't oblique.\r\n\r\nSecondly
    the colours you're using are too bright and cheerful. I do understand that the
    manufacturer is supposed to produce hybrid cars but right now it feels more like
    you're creating something for a candy company rather than a car manufacturer.
    While green, orange and blue are great colours for the theme you could try picking
    chromatic grays of those hues.\r\n\r\nAs Jason said as a first attempt the logo
    is quite impressive, and shows loads of potential. Keep working on it and you
    should have quite a strong identity by the end.\r\n\r\n-mmilo\r\n"

  body: "Agreed with above as well. I'm also getting a Hurricane feeling from the
    icon. I'm certain the cyclical nature of the icon is to show renewal, just getting
    'tropical storm warning' from it. \r\n\r\nIf there were a way to break up the
    symmetry just a bit? \r\n\r\n-Jac\r\n\r\nPronounced by saying 'Jake' without conjuring
    imagery of lumberjacks or mans best friend."
