  LIMFJORDS\xB7PORTER on the attached picture? The beer is my absolute favorite. The
  kerning on the label looks a bit odd, but the taste (of the beer, not the label)
  is top-notch.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LFP_4617.jpg]\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nEmil Hedevang"

    of the Alternate 'S' used that's part of the font.  Here's the link;  I've tried
    it with my copy of HouseGothic and it matches perfectly as long as you use the
    alternate S.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=15&subpage=viewfonts\r\n\r\nJH"

    look more like House Gothic 23 Condensed Black?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nEmil Hedevang"

    I know House Gothic 23 quite well and it doesn't really look like it."

  body: "Yes, Bald Condensed, I now agree with you after having compared with Compacta
    from MyFonts.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the sample from MyFonts, it appears to me
    that the poor kerning is partly due to the font itself.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/95a9f8c692c7f0d02dfcc4a19fc7e4_3892.png]"
