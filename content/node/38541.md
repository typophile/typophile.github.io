  why can't I embed images in my post? I have the most recent Flash player. Quite

  body: This doesn't strike me as a typeface that should have the uppercase set really
    tight. I'd letterspace it out enough that any pairs that need to be individually
    kerned can be done so without collisions.

    I''m limited by my horizontal space. Any suggestions for a similar font with a
    condensed version? I have Bauer Bodoni, but not condensed. '
