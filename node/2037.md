  body: 'You could try Matha Standun: Irish and living in Paris. I suspect he&#39;d
    be happy to talk to you about Irish type design, and the role of language and
    typography in nationalist politics.'

  body: yeah, i need, if not necessary an American, not a french. Any person who isn&#39;t
    french, live &#40;or is right now or before december&#41; in Paris, and has something
    interesting for me is good. <BR>I thought of M. Standun and still, as i often
    enjoy his posts; but my first idea is to get a font creator, if possible.

    <BR> <BR>2&#41; From S Carter&#39;s &#34;20th Century Type designers&#34;: <BR>
    <BR>&#34; <BR>Two of the designers of the generation after Roger Excoffon who
    have contributed most to French type design have been to some extent outsiders.
    Adrian Frutiger ... is Swiss, while the slightly older Jose Mendoza y Almeida,
    while born in France, is fiercely proud of his Spanish descent. <BR>&#34; <BR>
    <BR>If you could nab Mendoza, that would rock. <BR>Let me know if you need contact
    info &#40;although I&#39;d have to ask permission from a third party&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>3&#41; Try asking here: <a href="http://typo.textbox.org/" target="_blank">http://typo.textbox.org/</a>
    <BR> <BR>As for Matha, type design or no, hook up with him - you won&#39;t regret
    it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
