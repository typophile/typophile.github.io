  body: Not sure, but I like the look of it. I've never seen this edition of "The
    Crow" by Ted Hughes before, but I've found that it is a recent (2006) design by
    Build for Faber. Some info [[http://www.wearebuild.com/projects/the-crow|here]]
    so you might be able to ask them directly. Please let me know if you find it.
