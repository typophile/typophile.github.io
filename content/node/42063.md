  go with one of my own fonts, but I keep running into this error:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_4302.gif]\r\n\r\nIf
  I run <code>makeotf</code> on the Myriad sample provided by Adobe, things work perfect.
  I get the expected .otf file that works without a hitch.\r\n\r\nHere is the directory
  structure of the file I'm creating:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic-2_5286.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?"

    feature files, as Adobe has it in their Myriad sample, would do it. Like so:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic-1_3806.gif]\r\n\r\nStill
    no go."

  body: "<code>DanGayles-PowerBook:~/Fonts/build/fonts/parallelhistories/Roman/Regular
    Dan$ makeotf -r</code> was the basic command. \r\n\r\nI <code>cd</code> to the
    directory that contains the files to be converted, then run the command. It works
    for the Minion sample, but not mine. I created all of the documents using the
    Myriad files as templates, so I don't know if they are the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm
    reading Miguel Sousa's \"Font production at Adobe\" .pdf for some clues. I re-exported
    the .pfa using standard encoding, and that's getting me further along the line.\r\n\r\nNow
    I'm having an issue with the glyph names db. Will it never end? What's the best
    way to create or output that db from Fontlab 5 on a Mac?"

  body: I'm going to guess that you're not giving makeOTF info on what font outline
    file (OTF, PS, PFA) to make the font from, so it is using the default of font.ps,
    which isn't in your directory. Use 'makeOTF -f Parallel Histories.otf' and it
    should work, though I would take out the space in 'Parallel Histories', as you
    may have to escape the space on the command line. Taking out the space would mean
    that your makeOTF command would be 'makeOTF -f ParallelHistories.otf'.
