  body: Yes, I agree. The article deserves a font that honors the content. The sculptures
    aren't beaten-up ruins, the type shouldn't be either. If you look at authentic
    medieval manuscripts, or even the first printed books, you'll see that the lettering
    & type isn't jaggy at all, but clean and sharp.

  body: "Thanks, Andreas and Dan. \r\n\r\nI agree with your comments about the need
    for a cleaner digitization. The ideal from my point of view, based on looking
    at some contemporary manuscripts, was a radically cleaned up version of the type
    in the layout that retains just a very slight roughness. (I also disliked the
    numerals. I tried some smoothing before posting, but it became clear everything
    would need to be redrawn from scratch.)\r\n \r\nMany available options, especially
    those classified as Old English, feel too generic to me.\r\n\r\nI might try the
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/fleischmann-gotisch-pt/gallery.html\">Fleischmann

  body: "Not really an answer to the message above but an open question: \r\n\r\nI
    understand the poor relation between the design of Fraktur letters and arabic
    numerals - these numerals don't match the alphabetic glyph's shape, at least in
    most fonts, they just seem to have been roughly imported from other fonts (non-fraktur).
    \r\n\r\nDo you think they should be redesigned to blend in the font or should
    they stand out, for historical reason?"

  body: "I think that, when one is making new fonts, one should make the numbers match
    the letters. Many historical blackletter types did try to do this. Many others
    simply took figures from other designs that did not match.\r\n\r\nToday, designers
    never know what customers will use their fonts for. I say, give them the best
    tools possible. A \"literal\" blackletter revival is not an adequate tool: new
    characters will have to be designed and inserted into the font (i.e., accented
    characters for languages other than German, the Euro symbol, mathematical symbols,
    etc.). Why not numbers, too?\r\n\r\nIf you are a designer working with a font
    whose numbers do not \"match\", maybe you could try to pull numbers from an other
    font that are a little better? Or, maybe you don't really need so many numbers
    (in which case, it isn't a big issue). Or you could just use what the font delivers,
    and make a note to yourself to keep these questions in mind for future projects
    and/or licensing decisions?"

    in blackletter is that they were still in competition with Roman Numerals, so
    the historical references are fewer and in any case, the shapes were not standardized,
    however you would have thought that it was within the capabilities of type designers/recreators
    to produce something more in line with the other glyphs.\r\nTim"
