body: 'Hello typophiles, <BR> <BR>maybe i am on the wrong forum here, <BR>because
  the sample i send is not from  <BR>an existing font, but from something  <BR>i started.  <BR>
  <BR>I would like your input though, to know  <BR>if there is a similar font. So,
  do those  <BR>forms remind you any font?  <BR> <BR>I would happily accept advices  <BR>on
  how to start &#40;combinations i should  <BR>first check, optical corrections..etc.&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12923.gif"

  body: Hi Christos, post your sample at the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29.html?1058257973"
    target="_blank"> Critiques</a> Forum. <BR>That&#39;s where the real pros are.
    ;&#41; <BR> <BR>On first sight, your design doesn&#39;t look too similar  <BR>to
    anything I know of, so I guess you&#39;re good to go.  <BR>Looks promising!

    Jonathan Barnbrook</a> and Neville Brody comes to my mind...

  body: This does need to go into crit. I can see Barnbrook, for sure, but i think
    this would be interesting if you added more of the &#34;celtic&#34; characters
    as well. Kinda blackletter mixed or something.  For instance, mixing in these
    characters would allow the user a quasi-unicase or all-caps approach. hmm. just
    thoughts. <BR> <BR>Hooey! I shouldn&#39;t write until I wake up!
