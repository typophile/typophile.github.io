  also see it in my [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Fnix-(FREE-Typeface)/6901203|Behance]]\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is that you can provide feedback so I can make it better. This year (after
  I finish another typeface) I'll continue to develop it... creating ext. Latin-1,
  more OTF,  other weights and an interesting black-letter variant that matches.\r\n\r\n<img

    of Google team, who made it possible. But the rest will have a commercial licence,
    that's the only way I can dedicate the necessary time to design the font."

  body: "From my view, for a text font, first order of business: fix the vertical
    proportions. Because of how Latin-using languages use the vertical space, the
    ascenders should normally be longer than the descenders. Design is about balancing
    compromises, and to me the best benchmark is the \"g\": it has to look slightly
    vertically cramped (and slightly too small overall) for other more important things
    not to go wrong. And your \"g\" is too happy.  :-)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>that's the
    only way I can dedicate the necessary time</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI wish all open-source/free
    font advocates could so clearly admit the inevitable connection between time/effort/money
    and quality.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I should have said this in the same breath:\r\nWhether you decide to shorten
    and descenders versus lengthen the ascenders depends mostly on what point size
    range you're shooting for. Practically speaking (I mean in terms of saving effort)
    unless you have a size range firmly in mind, the way the spacing and color are
    already playing along* will determine which way to go: the bigger the x-height,
    the looser the spacing and the darker the color, because you're shooting for a
    smaller size (and vice versa). And before you get into specifics you need to decide
    if this is intended more for screen or print; check out Merriweather** for a nice
    design that's really screen-centric however.\r\n\r\n* With your (existing) cap
    height also playing a role.\r\n\r\n** http://typophile.com/node/102523\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
