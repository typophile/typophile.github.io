  body: "It's Bastarda style, judging from the shape of the 'o', and the closest style
    in general form (not details) that I could find was Washington Text (see http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script03Pg5.html).
    The 'a' is also not a very typical blackletter shape.\r\n\r\nIt would be my guess
    that this is custom lettering or a custom font, and not something commercially
    available. It looks very professional, whatever it is.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
