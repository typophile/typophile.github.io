  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've designed this logo for a small company that gives music, art, and sports lessons—aptly called MASA:music, arts, and sports academy.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Billboard-02_3843.png]
<!--break-->
I'm having some issues with the logo type below the actual stylized logotype. I've put MASA in stylized block forms, this having it's own rationale, but

1) I can't decide on a good enough face (i tried DIN) to set "music, arts, and sports academy" below the block forms. I want something that the company can also use as their brand typeface to use in their documents.

 and;

2) whether to put:

“music arts + sports academy”
“music, arts and sports academy”
“music + arts + sports academy”

is there some typographic rule when setting words strung like that? I feel like the comma takes away from the logo's possible timelessness or whatever, and disrupts its rhythm.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is my first post as a new member on typophile.

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the minimalist approach of the logo, but I would never know it said MASA unless you told me. And it'll get worse when you reduce the logo small, like on a business card or small web ad, as the differences between letters will become very tiny. 

But I like the general approach if you could just make the shapes a little more obvious.

As for question #2 I'd go with “music + arts + sports academy”. Bullets would also work -- "music • arts • sports academy".</div>

http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/morgan-sans

I imagine that Morgan would work well with it, and there’s a Slab version, too (e. g. for correspondence).

My 2 cents on your logo:
I didn’t read MASA right away. The /M/ is particularly giving me a hard time, I read it as a /U/. I’m sure there’s a way to keep the 4-blocks-idea but to improve readability. You might find some inspiration here:

It's a logo.

How about a light weight of a contemporary slab serif?
The monoline would be "flat" to match the graphic quality of the logo.
The light weight suitably arty, and the slab robust enough for sport.</div>

As much as I believe that there are more important parameters than legibility in a logo, as much I think one should avoid (undirected) confusion.</div>

How about just writing MUSIC / ARTS / SPORTS underneath the logo? I just have the problem that in my opinion music and arts are too separated in comparison to sports academy. Maybe you could try to write the 3 disciplines in one line and academy in the second to emphasize the connection of academy to all three.</div>

I like the idea of using + / or | between the words, but if you're going to use bars you may want to extend them above the cap-height/below the baseline.

Have you tried Proxima Nova for your accompanying type? Its circular geometric forms (I think) would compliment your square-ish designs nicely and provide some interesting contrast, especially in all caps and maybe tracked out a bit.
