  going to be a flash website so no problem with using any font. Design critiques
  welcome, but primarily wanted some help choosing a font for the logo which will
  compliemnt the background design(not totally finished also, but conveys the direction
  I hope) and also suggestions for the body type appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks Luke"
