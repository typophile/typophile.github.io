    is not spot-on, but reasonably close to your sample.

  body: I think it's potentially closer to another one of the Linotype Legibility
    Group typefaces, Ionic No. 5, digitised by Bitstream as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-701/|News
    701]]. But that's not quite it either...

  body: "First of all, I think calling this a slab serif is not correct. Both previous
    suggestions are close, and I want to add [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-century-schoolbook/?refby=bowfin|Century
    Schoolbook]] as another that I think is close.\r\n\r\nApparently there are untold
    versions of Century/Scotch Roman faces that were created in metal type, and what
    we can do is suggest similar digitized fonts, but the choices are relatively narrow
    compared to what probably existed in metal type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thing is, based on the layout style, the subject matter (a guide to exotic
    fruits), the oxidization colour of the paper and the presence of a section in
    Univers at the far right, I'd say this is from the mid-eighties at the very earliest,
    probably a decade later. Don't think any Swedish newspapers were still using hot-metal
    processes at that point, let alone letterpress, and most had already switched
    over to digital.

  body: "(Also, the headline's negative leading \u2013 not sure about phototypesetting,
    but it seems to me to be a feature distinctly of the digital age. And IIRC four-colour
    printing of photographs would not feature in most newspapers before the 90s.)"
