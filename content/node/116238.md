  like engravers, but better proportions, plus it's cute and rounded.  Lil' Help? "

  body: 'Part of the fact it looks rounded (artificially?), I confirm exactly what
    Fivos said. Proportions, balance and design look to match Sackers: /S, /E, /B
    and /M look spot on to me. As far as I know, I''m not aware of any rounded version
    so it could simply be custom job, a manually rounded Sackers. I could also be
    totally wrong so may be, giving more details like for instance the sample origin
    could help to solve the case.'
