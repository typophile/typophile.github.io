<p>With so many fonts out there is really difficult to know them all, but the first thing is doing a little research to check if something similar has been made already. There are a lot of things yet to be done but you need to find them. But if happens that something mine is very similar to others, I’d try to find something new to offer.</p>

<p>Related question. I try to see a hole to fill (oldstyle numerals, small caps, more weights, etc.). But first of all, I only start a project if I see that I can say something new. At least new to me, because other people may see no difference.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The question you want to ask is how useful will your font be. Answering this question is a function of your design skills and your knowledge of fonts.</p>
<p>Is Christian Schwartz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guardian&rdquo; font original? That depends on whom you ask. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that original. Yet it is a very distinguished font, with a contemporary feel. Stag is a little more original, but not as useful. Sometimes originality means it will be less useful.</p>
<p>Script fonts&hellip; lots of potential for originality there. And a big market too.</p>
<p>Logo work calls for original fonts. Although most good logo designers either tweak existing fonts or make their own.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think I&rsquo;m learning that the concept behind a font can be more important than how similar it might seem to other fonts. If approached from a new angle, fonts generally end up with their own voice even if there are similarities with other fonts. I think a font needs to address a purpose and without that there&rsquo;s going to be no incentive for people to get excited about it. (One I started last week was just an aimless experiment and looked very nothingy.)</p>
<p>Equally, modifying a font just so it look less like something else sounds like a bad idea. It needs to look like itself and if it shared characteristics with another one, perhaps that&rsquo;s a plus. Especially if the other font is successful. Of course I don&rsquo;t think one should intentionally based a design on someone else&rsquo;s but if it happens that way I think it&rsquo;s more truly expressing your intent. As people we can look at others for inspiration but we should aim to be most of all ourselves, no matter whether others are similar or dissimilar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes originality means it will be less useful
Yes. I have the luxury of type design as a hobby. If I had to rely on it for my income I&rsquo;d want to focus on usefulness, which might preclude originality, though I&rsquo;d hope not. I was looking at Spiekermann&rsquo;s Axel today, which looks pretty useful, though very similar to Unit, Meta or Info, at least to my eye. Originality has to be very sure of itself to overcome the but-it&rsquo;s-less-useful threshhold.</p>

<p>Perhaps some people will just prefer your approach. Lots of different winemakers make similar style wines, but none of them are exactly the same. Same with typefaces.</p>
<p>As a fan of sicilian wine I can tell you there are lots of producers making wine from nero d&rsquo;avola but only a few are my favorites.</p>
<p>Of course I suppose the entry point is making something of quality.</p>
