  body: Thank you Steve. <BR> <BR>I sent an e-mail to them requesting this, but never
    got a reply back. <BR> <BR>Now that it&#39;s available for download, I don&#39;t
    have to wait. All I have to do is download it. And then all I&#39;ve got to do
    is learn how to read.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/plain.gif"
