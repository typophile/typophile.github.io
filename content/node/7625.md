    target="_blank"> this</a> it&#39;s Didot. I&#39;m not 100% sure if it&#39;s the

  body: The graphics for the show on the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/city/" target="_blank">web
    site</a> are Trajan - but my recollection is that the <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00004RFCM.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"
    target="_blank">original graphics</a> &#40;and credits&#41; are in Bodoni or Didot.
    <BR> <BR>It would be helpful to know which you&#39;re looking for.

    target="_blank">Didot</a> when I read Yves post.

    the font used. <BR>It&#39;s Bodoni-like, but not quite that. It&#39;s between
    Bold and Black and maybe somewhat stretched. <BR> <BR>&#40;Don&#39;t mind the
    pictograms in the corner -- here in the Netherlands they&#39;re required. These
    signify: PG a2 or older, images of a sexual nature, and abusive language. LOL!&#41;<img

    of the usual suspects, so that would require some  <BR>investigation.

    the c and e. It may have been modified a bit for the show logo.

  body: Thanks guys, appreciate it. I don&#39;t need to know exactly which one it
    is, bodoni will do fine although the slope on the &#39;c&#39; and &#39;e&#39;
    isn&#39;t straight as i found it was on bodoni no. 2. I think that&#39;s the one
    they&#39;ve been using on the screenshot picture... Yves, Bert, Patricia. Thanks
    a million.

    known logos with Didone faces for school, didn&#39;t think of Sex And The City!

    <BR> <BR>And I only have five so far, what a shame.. I bet Yves and the other
    guys could name at least 10 from the top of their knowledgeable heads.
