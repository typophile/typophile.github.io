  body: I love the name - where did it come from? The font feels anti-Frutiger in
    a way, so an Avenir + Univers origin for the name seems unlikely?

    word and loved it also."

  body: "Thanks Bert.\r\n\r\niKern is (still) a service. It can't be purchased or
    licensed. The font files are reworked by Igino and then send back. It's not just
    a push on a button, because many variables are possible. We did some test runs
    to determin spacing (family wide) and the level (tight <-> loose) of kerning.
    In the process of the test runs I adjusted character shapes that needed a better
    fit. In the final release I adjusted a (very few) things manually. iKern makes
    it own classes for kerning and is extremely flexible. All still (fortunately)
    has to be judged by the human eye, but when decisions are made, all that is handled
    by iKern is in optical consistency truly great. For me it was a real time saver.
    It nearly felt that I only had to draw the glyphs ;-)"

    don't understand. In a comix perspective, Avenir is a anti Univers, which makes

    As a freefont it was my second most popular font with about 10,000 downloads a
    month and I've seen it used in quite a variety of designs. I hope that with the
    extension of the family this will continue. I have plans to update the family
    with a (free) bold italic and maybe with small caps for all weights/styles.\r\n"
