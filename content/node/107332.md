  body: "Annie Up is interesting. A blend of the old design for Concave Tuscan, e.g.
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/concave-tuscan/ with the mini serifs of
    a font such as Memo: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/memo/pro-medium/\r\nHope
    someone finds a match for you.\r\nIt would be a real challenge to make a font
    that could look like Pistol Annies. This would require special ligatures for most
    of the letter combinations. So it's probably lettering.\r\nDon\r\n"
