  with random contextual alternates and trying to 'un-random' them at very specific
  times.\r\n\r\nI posted a comment on a previous thread earlier tonight (http://typophile.com/node/19625),
  but realized it might be best to create a new one (someone slap me if I need to
  go back to the old one)\r\n\r\nMy question is: given that mentioned randomization
  approaches with the calt feature, what happens if I want to ignore certain letter
  combinations in lieu of something more specific to the typeface in order to avoid
  pairing a one and two story 'a' together or a standard or binocular 'g' together
  for instance? \r\n\r\nI only want to 'control' this pairing if the letters are next
  to each other?\r\n\r\nhow can I correctly ignore a pairing but keep the rest of
  the randomization intact?"
