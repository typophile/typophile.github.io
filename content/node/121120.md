body: "Former Typophile moderator Zara Vasquez-Evens has written an interesting article
  on Medium (https://medium.com/@CommandZed/thoughts-on-an-improved-opentype-ui-c6748f2eef3a),
  prompted by the recent petition for a better user interface for accessing OpenType
  features in design software (http://ilovetypography.com/2014/10/22/better-ui-for-better-typography-adobe-petition/).\r\n\r\nA
  few selected quotes:\r\n<blockquote><p>What the sh*t is a Stylistic Set? Most of
  the discussions and UI mock-ups floating around of proposed UI solutions that I
  have seen, seem to be created by type designers, for expert users, i.e., people
  who know a thing or two about font technology. While every idea is valuable, there
  is a fundamental UI component that seems to be overlooked and that is nomenclature.
  There are differences in the language that type designers speak and the language
  that the broader design community speaks.</p></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><p>How
  are we planning to educate people on the complexities of font technologies and the
  features available to them? How can type designers and advocates for great typography
  better inform the general population on how to take advantage of a font\u2019s potential?</p></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><p>We
  need tools that are dynamic, context-sensitive, and smart.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\nI,
  for one, would welcome a completely visual solution."

    too. As far as the Stylistic Sets are concerned one would always need the typeface\u2019s
    description or manual at hand to know what SS01 is able to do with a font."

  body: "Yes, stylistic sets are one of the more opaque features available: you can\u2019t
    figure them out even if you know the terminology.\r\nEven though, there could
    be some problem with a purely visual interface:\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"
    lang=\"en\"><p>Perhaps we shouldn&#39;t be so quick to encourage accessible OpenType
    features. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hashtag/AdobeTypeUI?src=hash\">#AdobeTypeUI</a>

    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n;-)\r\nSurely bad taste will not be stopped by
    a better user interface, but some OpenType features aren\u2019t just visual, they
    also carry semantic meanings, which should be addressed."

    be placed before the visual: \u203AFeature Final Forms \u2013 image\u2039"
