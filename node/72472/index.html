  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone,

I'm designing a two-pocket folder for a Hotel whose architecture is based on the designs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright.</a> I'm looking for a typeface that can appropriately harmonize or allude to his work and organic architecture in general.

For better or worse, this design is to highlight the wedding and reception services that the hotel (and adjacent mansion) facilitate. So a straight up typeface emblematic of Wright's work may or may not fit the bill. That said,

I'm curious of:
• if anything comes to mind immediately, and
• if you can think of a script typeface that still embodies Wright.

That last one is a tall order but maybe there's hope.

Thanks all!</div>

What if instead, one looked for the kind of font Wright might use... I meant.
So if you look at something he designed for print,

(lots of nice extras too)

And then drew from there.

		<div class="commentbody">Bert — To be fair, we can’t be sure whether the type for <em>The House Beautiful</em> was spec’ed by FLW or by his partner in this venture, William Herman Winslow, who owned the private press. FLW designed the page schemes and ornamentation, obviously. But he may not have been directly involved in the composition of the text. And the all-caps was not out of keeping with the small, private, vanity press style of the day (ca. 1896–7).

Nick — I don’t know that we [I did some of the research on this for DB, including those photos] ever positively nailed the type. Without any lowercase, it’s a little tricky. But my conclusion was either Custer from Western Type Foundry (out of Chicago, near to where this was printed) or Cushing No. 2 from ATF (which also had a Chicago office). 

MacGrew states that Custer was a copy of Cushing No. 2 (not to be confused with Cushing Oldstyle or Cushing Antique). Both were precursors to some of the later Bookman series.</div>

My 1912 ATF specimen catalog shows Cushing No. 2--at least in cuts smaller than 18 pt.--to be quite similar to Salisbury and the samples provided; however, the W in Cushing doesn't quite match the sample. I haven't unpacked my BB&amp;S (successor to Western Type Foundry) specimen books yet, so I can't check Custer...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I assume this is primarily a matter of display, in which case being more "typographic" is not necessarily the thing. 

If you want it too look like Wright's lettering on architectural drawings, then I suppose all caps of Eagle Feather will work. 

If you want hand writing, then the eccentric and period Midway may work in giving it a unique flavor. 

The low contrast all caps may be authentic, but they don't say "Frank Lloyd Wright" to me.

Incidentally, I don't think Wright's decoration and writing were his strong suit in any case. In general it's his awesome interior spaces. For decoration, I much prefer his teacher, Louis Sullivan. </div>

I've slept in both, (it's a Wisconsin thing to do), and I can tell you that the teacher was, as you say, into awesome interior space, while the student was more concerned about how the awesome interior spaces related to the awesome exterior spaces. I think that marks their major difference though I'm hardly an architectural critic.

		<div class="commentbody">If your library has a copy of the FLW-designed Auvergne edition, I’m going to bet it’s a facsimile, since there were only 90 copies printed and only a dozen whose whereabouts are known (and I don’t think Yale has one — that’s where you are, right?).

There’s a 1963 facsimile that’s supposed to be quite good. And a 1996 one that’s supposedly fair. Probably plenty good enough for your purposes. 

Make sure that your library’s copy is not the original <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=a6gCAAAAYAAJ&dq=House+Beautiful+Frank+Lloyd+Wright+Auvergne&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=AQRYTIq2KoPUngeJ2MnOCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false">James H. West Co. edition</a> (not designed by FLW). You’ll be disappointed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha kent it tickles me pink that you think I have any affiliation with Yale. But alas, New Haven is just my hometown.

Ideally, though, having access to their library would be nice at this point. The copy at my current college's library is not Lloyd's House Beautiful—it's a book of the same name revolving around a famous English novelist (Wilder I think? I searched for it awhile ago.)

I'm going to see what the Interlibrary Loan can produce. The librarians usually jump on opportunities to grab something unique so we'll see how it goes. I will take your notes into consideration, thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. Sorry, must’ve gotten confused. There’s someone around here who is (was?) at Yale. I saw the New Haven and just jumped to a conclusion.

Here’s <a href="http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Books/h1996-12.htm">a web page</a> with information about various editions of FLW’s <em>House Beautiful</em>.

No. 39 on that list, in the Chapin Library collection, is the one from which DB’s image, above, was taken.

Good luck in your search.</div>
