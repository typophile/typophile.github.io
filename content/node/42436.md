    as the 'original'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_mpi_3594.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    second typeface is Helvetica Condensed and Helvetica Condensed Bold.\r\nBut what
    is the serif typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help again :)"

    Helvetica Condensed Bold? To me they seem like they could be condensed weights
    of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/\">Univers</a>.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have a larger image?"
