body: This is not a real typeface, per say, but something I drew in Photoshop.  It&#39;s
  an experiment to see if you can create anything legible in a really small scale.  So
  if people can read my name, I guess it was somewhat successful.  I&#39;m not sure
  if I could create a whole uppercase alphabet, many of the letters would be indistinguishable.  Let
  me know if you&#39;re able to read what it says.  Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53211.gif"

    kudos on the willingness to share yours with the rest of us. i think it&#39;s
    pretty cool. <BR> <BR>as for readability: it&#39;s tough. in situations like this,
    word recognition is the fall back for a reader, but unfortunately &#40;at least
    in my case&#41;, not enough of the individual characters are recognizable to make
    assumptions on what each word is supposed to be. <BR> <BR>in your example, my
    first guess was &#34;launi johansen&#34;. <BR> <BR>you might be able to make something
    of the 200%  mag version though. the 400 and 800 too for that matter. each character
    looks like a puzzle piece to me, and could turn out to be a pretty cool stylistic
    or decorative font for titling if you were to put in the time to work out the
    kinks.'

  body: 'This is great stuff. <BR>Using grays to convey a higher resolution of shape
    is both useful and entirely possible - although it seems to me you&#39;ll have
    to go to 3 pixels. In fact something like that has already been done: there&#39;s
    a font, an outline font, called &#34;Alien:Gray3&#34; by Joshua Distler of Shiftype
    &#40;featured in the book Face2Face&#42;, I believe&#41; which uses a 3x3 grid,
    where each &#34;pixel&#34; is a circle of one of three different sizes. It works.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; A tall-format silvery book which came out around 1999 I think.
    And it was overpriced. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    version as decorative font.  Not sure if it&#39;s possible to do the grayscales
    in an actual typeface at such a large scale though.'

  body: 'Hrant: Thanks!  I was just going to reply to your previous comment.  I&#39;m
    doing some cathing up on the forum.  How would that work to have a big gray area?  Would
    you have the create some halftone pattern, or some other kind of pattern to make
    a program render it gray? <BR> <BR>That 3x3 circle font is brilliant!  It could
    probably be done with other shapes as well, maybe squares or diamonds, or maybe
    some sort of pattern.  I haven&#39;t tried this pattern idea in practice, so I&#39;m
    not sure it would work in reality. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s only one use I can really
    think of for an illegible 2-pixel font, thumbnails or small previews of page layouts,
    where you might want to see what text looks like instead of having grey boxes.  But
    since the original document wouldn&#39;t use this font, it wouldn&#39;t really
    work...'

  body: 'Hrant, <BR> <BR>Please have a look at the attached pdf.  Is this what you
    had in mind for the pattern? <BR> <BR>At smaller sizes vector-based programs render
    the patterns as pure black.  And at larger sizes you will see the pattern they
    consist of.  &#40;I can&#39;t get a nice smooth grey at all.&#41;  When viewing
    the PDF at 75% you can see the pixel pattern clearly since one unit of the letter
    will correspond to one pixel.  The &#34;A&#34; is 1000 units tall. <BR> <BR>To
    get a nice even grey color I need to take the vector shape &#40;the &#34;A&#34;&#41;
    to Photoshop and render it at a height of 250 pixels with anti-alias on. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe there&#39;s a different method that solves this better that I don&#39;t
    know off.  To be honest I haven&#39;t done any research on this because I wanted
    to see how I would solve this first. <BR> <BR>This is an interesting problem indeed.  <IMG

  body: Lauri, sorry it took so long for me to get back to this. <BR> <BR>So I guess
    you&#39;re saying that you can&#39;t get any pattern to come out as any gray at
    any size in PDF? My guess is that it&#39;s due to the different way vectors and
    fonts are rendered; this is basically due to different rendering engines for each
    task. Like I know that when I put Mana in a PDF, and it&#39;s viewed at 100%,
    I do get what I want. So try making a font &#40;a TT one - PS is probably different,
    and less predictable&#41; and embed <i>that</i> in a PDF. <BR> <BR>As for the
    patterns you&#39;re using, I&#39;m actually not an expert on that &#40;Chris at
    Ultrafonts is&#41;, although it seems to me what you have should work. Don&#39;t
    know about those thick borders though. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>The amount of postings and research you do I&#39;m surprised
    that you have time to get back at all.  So thank you!  =&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    try making a truetype font instead of just using vector shapes.  The reason I
    used the heavy black border was to show that the font actually has two different
    &#34;colors&#34;, if I wanted the whole thing grey I could have adjusted the opacity
    or typed in grey. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR>Lauri
