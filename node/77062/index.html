  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello fellow typophilians,</p>
<p>As some of you already know Expletus Sans Basic will soon be released in the Google font directory. I am also working on Expletus Serif, but I just need to work on something new and exciting. So I started off closing the gaps in Expletus Sans. Nick Shinn already pointed out to me I should do that, but I was stubborn. Yes Nick, you were right. Anyhow, &lsquo;just closing some gaps&rsquo; (it&rsquo;s not that easy off coarse) wasn&rsquo;t satisfying enough. First off all I want it to become very readable. Secondly, I want it to be very readable ON Screen, for web use on small sizes. Since @font-face I am disappointed with the number of rivals for Verdana (readable at small sizes). So, naive as I am, I decided to give it a go myself. I&rsquo;ll upload a picture of how it performs in a few weeks in the critique section. To get to the point, I would like to know if any of you have some good information or links on what makes a typeface perform well on screen.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jasper de Waard</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dave Berlow and Roger Black preach what they call the Verdana principle: if you want it to work as screen type it needs to be as wide as Verdana, the x-height needs to be as high as Verdana, and the apertures need to be as big as Verdana. And, of course, have it hinted by experts.</p>
<p>But a little advice: don’t get hung up on technical stuff this early in your font design career. I feel like I made a mistake by getting wrapped up in stuff like language support, big families, legibility, OpenType, scripting, etc.. Doing that stuff is really tough without a solid foundation in creating good looking fonts without bells and whistles. Right now I have several type families in development that took far too long because of this. I’m going to get them done and just focus on simple stuff for a year or two. Do yourself a favor and don’t get into this position —just work on the basics for a few years.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point James.
(I&rsquo;ve got some single-style faces in the works.)
Nonetheless, I still say that it makes practical sense to conceive of a sans typeface from Thin to Black from the outset.
Because fleshing out missing weights later, especially at the extremes, is a horrible hassle.</div>

<p>I very much agree with you there. But I also think it’s probably best to learn to design them independently before worrying about them as extremes in a family.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t do this because I think I have to learn it, or because I think it will be great succes. I do this because it&rsquo;s fun. And to be honest with you. Expletus Sans Text only has auto otf hinting, but IMO reads almost as comfortable as verdanana. When I opened up verdana (pre-instaled on my mac) in fontlab, I was surprised to see it didn&rsquo;t have any hints. Does that mean hints aren&rsquo;t necessary at all? If my font works well [[http://somadesign.ca/projects/fontfriend|here]] does that mean it will work likewise in most other browsers and operating systems? It almost seems as if Fontfriend does the spacing and hinting automatically, but that seems rather impossible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why one should learn to draw the weights independantly. If you can make a black, you can make a bold, I would say.</p>
<p>Thanks for some good points guys!</p>

<p>You are a Mac user, aren&rsquo;t you? Unfortunately, what you are seeing may be representative for what designers will see on OSX, but not for what the majority of internet users will see on Windows. Rasterization of OTFs, and unhinted OTFs in particular, is far from ideal on Windows, especially Windows XP which is still the most popular version: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" target="_blank">statistics 1</a> and <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200911-201011" target="_blank">statistics 2</a> (with thanks to Stephen Coles for this link). Also see Stephen Coles' article at <a href="http://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/the-webfont-revolution-is-over-let-the-evolution-begin/" target="_blank">Typographica</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my wishlist for the new year, I hope that users of Windows XP will update to Windows 7 which offers much improved font rasterization &hellip;</p>

Why windows needs or ever needed any hinting is rapidly spinning up to a fontnado, a typocane, or a typhoont, I can never remember which.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jasper, if you follow your own work, whatever problems it leads you to, those are the problems you should learn to understand and design solutions for. In this case, I think you are going in a good direction, looking at Verdana to learn about good screen font design. While you are looking, closely study the relationship of Verdana to Verdana bold, in addition to what DT said I preach already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly looking forward to seeing your design on Google and would be glad to help you get it hinted when that time comes, if you have questions.</p>

Right now, I can&rsquo;t see myself doing any other profession by typedesign.</p>
<p>@Karsten: Yes I&rsquo;m a mac user.Thanks for the links. The fact that xp doesn&rsquo;t rasterize fonts so well really changes the matter. I guess autohinting won&rsquo;t work in that case -.- Perhaps I can develop this typeface very slowly, so that it&rsquo;s finished when most people have upgraded to Windows 7. Although windows 7 doesn&rsquo;t bring many improvements, microsoft will probably find a way of forcing their customers to upgrade, or the customers will shift to Mac or Linux.</p>
<p>@David: 200,000,000? Damn. <em> I&rsquo;m certainly looking forward to seeing your design on Google </em> :-D <em> and would be glad to help you get it hinted when that time comes, if you have questions. </em> Thanks, I&rsquo;ll surely have questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>After some quick googling I discovered that many xp users have upgraded to IE7 which uses cleartype. 30% uses IE 8, 12% uses IE 7, 8% is a mac user (I assume they don&rsquo;t use IE), and 29% has Windows 7 (out of that 29%, I assume around 14% doesn&rsquo;t use IE, so we can add 15% to the total.)</p>
<p>This makes: 30+12+8+15=65% of the world internet users has properly rasterized fonts. This number gets bigger every month, as Mac gets more popular and many Xp users will upgrade Windows 7.</p>
<p>This all might not make a lot of sense to some of you, but if I&rsquo;m right, only 35% (getting less by the month) has problems with .otf fonts on the web at small sizes.</p>
<p>Just trying to look at the bright side of things ;-)</p>

<p>You should probably play around with Raph&rsquo;s little GASP table script (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/source/browse/tools/gasp/">http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/source/browse/tools/gasp/</a>) – it may or may not improve anything.</p>
<p>To answer your question about Linux rasterization, look up FreeType. It uses an autohinter which is awesome (I&rsquo;m using it right now).</p>
<p>(In the end, pixels are too big. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for everyone to get iPhone4-style displays for their desktops. Maybe 10 years from now <em>we</em> will, but there are still many sitting in front of crappy internet café PCs in less developed places right now; and they won&rsquo;t. So Verdana and/or shitty-looking websites will be around for quite some time, and I would agree that you shouldn&rsquo;t spend too much of your time worrying about that.)</p>
<p>P.S. Be careful with such statistics. IE7/8, on XP or Vista, <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/crimson#browse-browser-samples">doesn&rsquo;t</a> imply good-looking fonts per se. Also, the statistics may come from a website visited by, to put it bluntly, rich people. I&rsquo;m sure people in, say, Northern China or the Peruvian hinterland don&rsquo;t have a 29% Windows 7 share.</p>
