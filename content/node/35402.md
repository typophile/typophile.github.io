body: Hey, all.  I'm looking for a logo critique from some of the smartest type nerds
  on the planet, so if you could indulge me, I'd really appreciate it.  The themes
  I'm trying to convey are stability, dependability, precision, and harmony.  I've
  reached that point where everything looks the same to me, and I don't really have
  anyone else to bounce this off of right now.  Thanks!

  body: "Lex - I'm very analytical and rational.  I love grids, I love simple geometric
    shapes, and I love the 1:4:9 proportions of the Clarke monolith, so combining
    that with print's most interesting (to me) and second most important (to me) color
    was a no-brainer.\r\n\r\nI chose DIN because of its visual similarity to the 4:9
    ratio and modified the letterforms slightly to emphasize that.  That the word
    \"MONOLITH\" fits perfectly inside the shape while retaining the 1:4:9 proportions
    is, I confess, a happy coincidence."

    of the shop, very cool. but with the logo, it seems very \"see and say\". the
    name is red monolith, so show me a red monolith. i think there are some other
    ideas and metaphors out there that may be more pleasing. how can you say HUGE
    without showing me two things? maybe you cannot. how about a looming shadow. an
    ant's eye view. 3-dimensional going WAY up. maybe more exaggerated so we can get
    the idea of monolith. monolith is HUGE, not just big.\r\n\r\nok, i am done rambling.
    i hope this helps?"

  body: Thanks to everyone for their critiques.  It's pretty funny how often I tell
    people to not be quite so literal in their design work but when it comes to my
    own identity I go and do just that!  Thanks, Andy - it is certainly worth considering
    and I will do some more sketches tonight.  Thankfully there's no rush on this,
    so I can take the time to do it right.  I'm still interested in what everyone
    else has to say, of course.

  body: "Lex, that approach is sometimes used by large companies and corporations
    with a marketing budget large enough to establish their name and identity with
    mult-media, typically supplementing a non-descript image with the use of sound,
    for example, by speaking the company's name aloud in radio and television ads.
    Even so most examples still include an acronym with the visual element.\r\n\r\nFor
    a small design shop a graphic logo with no text at all, not even an acronym, might
    be too obscure. Keeping it simple generally produces good design, but given how
    minimal this one is, getting rid of the text altogether would make it reductive,
    and for clients, incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    B illustrates the huge scale with the big rectangle vs. small type perfectly,

    do the simple strong shape you're always begging everyone else to try.\"  And
    then I chickened out at the last minute, just like everyone else does.  :)  But
    I have to say that while it's nice to have a one color logo, the text inside the
    monolith cheapens it a little bit, gives it a weak footing.  I really wanted to
    go with the one-color and stick with it, but after taking a few days off I have
    to say that I'm not so fond of the text inside and that Koppa's arguments are
    very persuasive.\r\n\r\nSim - I had done a lot of sketches where the object was
    built using the type, with \"RED\" as the front face and \"MONOLITH\" as the side,
    all put together at an extreme angle, but I just couldn't make it work.  \r\n\r\nRobert

  body: "Red, cheers I'm glad you like Rhodaelian. Koppa's rationale about the large
    rectangle next to the small type illustrating huge scale is true in a general
    sense. Some observers, however, may reason that if the type is only a few inches
    high the rectangle, while much taller, must be only a few feet tall and hardly
    giant-scale. Depends on reproduction size and how philosophical you want to be
    about this. Adding an element of readily-recognized size, such as a human figure,
    would make the scale of things indisputable, but that's an intellectual conceit
    and there's a lot to be said for keeping things simple. It was just a passing
    thought.\r\n\r\nRobert, do you have the Flash 9 plugin installed? It's essential

    second side with the name only.  With the new treatments there would obviously
    be some changes to accommodate the figure in small-scale reproduction.  I'm a
    prepress/production guy from the start so I have thought about the absolute minimum
    sizes I can get away with, but it's always good to be reminded.

    film and Clark's book. It was a teaching machine that supercharged the apes and
    made them evolve.\r\n\r\nYou're right Red, it does make an interesting visual.

    you have to work out just how much this little person fits into your brand. Will
    he work on business cards, on your site and in your marketing materials? I'm often
    frustrated when brands or a logo changes through different collateral. That being
    said, the little guy gives a whole different feeling to the logo in each representation.
    Go with your gut.\r\n\r\n I find many design shops and even large ad firms take
    a far too simplistic approach to their own brand (think DRAFTFCB). You're showing
