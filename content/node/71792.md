  to modernize  Typophile's front page? I like having popular and recent posts on
  view but at the same time, I hate the loading delay, the size and how it doesn't
  show up at all on iProducts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd really like to be able to turn off
  the swear filters as I am not under 10 years old.\r\n\r\nI hope I don't come across
  as snarky, I'm just wondering if there are plans to change it or is the status quo
  what Typophile will be in 2011, 2012."

    up on Apple products doesn't mean it's not modern. It could use a refresh, though,
    I guess.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize there was a swear filter. Fuck. Apparently there
    is. I'm not a big fan of them :)"

  body: +1 for a flash free front page, putting aside the slow loading time, I hate
    the inability to open any of the topics listed on the front page in a new tab,
    I have to open a topic, read it, then go back to the front page to select another
    one, which is very painful rendering it near useless to me.

    be shielded from disapproved words if they like. I''d like the option to toggle
    swear filters on principle: censorship blows goats . . . and is often ineffective,
    for example on the topic of blowing goats.'

    No reason the functionality of the front page can't be re-envisioned with jQuery-style
    (or choose your JS flavor) paradigm...

  body: I also would like to be able to open various threads in tabs, instead of one
    at the time. And the time it takes for the flash to load is too long, and in my
    opinion unneccesary.

  body: "A bit more about the inconsistency of being able to open links in new tabs.
    I do realize that I can ctrl-click some links to open them in new tabs. Or right,
    click/open in new tab. The inconsistency is frustrating because clicking on links
    is something that's done unconsciously. I pretty much spend all day with a browser
    open and I usually nail the control key when I click on links. Even though I visit
    Typophile often, I still try to ctrl click the links on the front page . . . just
    because that's the way the rest of the web works. If I'm writing a message and
    I want to open a new instance of Typophile to check my facts, I often absent mindedly
    try to right click the logo. A few years ago, yeah, there were a lot of sites
    that were Flash heavy and you weren't surprised if ctrl-clicking failed. I guess
    maybe I notice it more because Flash sites are getting rare.  I know this has
    been discussed before but here we are in the middle of 2010 with the same deal
    going down, wondering if anyone's taking notice.\r\n\r\nAnd the censorship has
    got to go. Really. Why can't that just be turned off? Is it hard coded in the
    Typophile mainframe or something? Am I on the Disney Channel? C'mon."

  body: "As you can imagine, Flash has been the key way we attract sponsors who want
    to show their releases to the type community. \r\n\r\nI'm pleased to tell you
    we've engaged a Drupal developer to build a non-Flash home page that we expect
    will render much more quickly. (If you care about the technical details, it's
    that extra step of pulling the aggregated content out of Drupal, writing an XML
    file on the fly and loading that XML into the Flash that means longer load times
    for the home page).\r\n\r\nWe're also investigating non-Flash (non SIFR) ways
    to render the type that meet our sponsors' requirements for the use of their fonts.
    This update will affect all pages in the site, not just the home page.\r\n\r\nSteven:
    Regarding design for Apple's iOS. It's not just to support Apple devices - though
    our traffic logs show a significant amount of iOS traffic. There are more modern
    ways to display custom type on a page. SIFR has always been a workaround, and
    finally the web is moving beyond this workaround. (Viva HTML5!)\r\n\r\nRegarding
    swearing: If you want to add color to a conversation you'll have more impact if
    you smoked a pipe, or used words like penultimate."
