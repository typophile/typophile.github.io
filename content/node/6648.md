  body: It&#39;s a circus style that Intecsas sold under the name of Buffalo Bill
    &#40;often available as freeware from the David Rakowski collection, before Intecsas
    marketed them&#41;. These fonts used to be sold by Precision Type, but they recently
    ceased selling fonts.  <BR> <BR>Adobe also sold it as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/"
    target="_blank">&#39;Rosewood&#39;</a>.  <BR> <BR>The Solotype Catalog &#40;p.36&#41;
    calls it &#39;Coffee Can Initials&#39;. <BR> <BR>More than you ever wanted to
    know.

    target="_blank">here</a> or you could try other keywords like circus or wildwest
    &#40;neither of which quite yielded your font&#41;. <BR> <BR>You could also look
    at <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=circus" target="_blank">circus</a>
    which is free.'

  body: Coffee Can Initials is by no means the same as your sample, <BR>but is likely
    as close as you&#39;re going to get in a font. <BR> <BR>I thought I&#39;d mention
    that <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/mueller/a_f.htm" target="_blank">
    Rick Mueller</a>, like Rakowski, digitized <BR>this typeface years ago and <a
    href="http://www.faces.co.uk/products/fonts/view.cfm?productsku=IN20117" target="_blank">
    Buffalo Bill</a> may still be had via Faces.

  body: Mike, You&#39;re right that Coffee Can Initials is different than the posted
    sample. It is however just like Rick Mueller&#39;s Coffee Tin, and Buffalo Bill.
    It is Adobe Rosewood which is like the posted sample.  <BR> <BR>My Bad. I thought
    they were all the same.

  body: I&#39;m REALLY not trying to be contentious Mike, but to my inexpert eye they
    <BR>ARE all the same and all, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/regular/testdrive.html?s=EXTRAVGNZ&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> including Rosewood</a>, have the same basic <BR>letterform differences.
    What am I missing ... ? <BR> <BR>To me, it looks like someone took a set of those
    spear point decorations <BR>and plopped them onto a different font, with little
    concern for getting them <BR>on straight, no adjustments for size with different
    letters and no curving in <BR>the G or R. <BR><br>

  body: Coffee Tin and Rosewood are slightly different from one another &#40;see the
    &#39;R&#39;&#41;, but both are more divergent from the posted sample than they
    are from each other. The patterning is basically the same, but the letterforms
    are almost <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/regular/testdrive.html?s=EXTRAVAGANZA&amp;p=72">completely
    different</a>. <BR> <BR>So what is the sample? Looks to me like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy-heavyface/heavyface-d/testdrive.html?s=EXTRAVAGANZA&amp;p=60">Goudy
    Heavyface</a>, squoooshed to about 65% and decorated to look like Rosewood/Coffee
    Tin. I think it&#39;s squooshed

  body: Rosewood is almost nothing like the posted sample. The only similarities are
    the interior diamonds. The letterforms are different in many ways, however. Mike
    F is right, in my opinion.

  body: OK, I give up. I can see that there are differences, and I agree that Rosewood
    doesn&#39;t match the sample either. I apologize for my  lack of precision.  <BR>
    <BR>However, Rosewood is NOT the same as all the others, at least in the way the
    diamonds are on the A.  <BR> <BR>Mike F.  and Metadox have probably nailed it,
    as an attempt to approximate one of those  fonts.  <BR> <BR>I need to stop &#39;impressionistic&#39;
    IDing.
