body: "Hi there,\r\nThis isn't a question related to typography as such, but I figured
  that this would be a suitable place to ask it given the prevalence of graphic designers
  floating around here!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it was possible to get text in InDesign
  to 'flow' into another text box once the first text box is full. \r\n\r\nFor instance,
  I have two textboxes, A and B. I fill A with text. When A becomes full, I want the
  text to spill over into B.\r\n\r\nIs this possible, and if so, how? Or is there
  an easier way to get the functionality that I am describing?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nCale"

    sign (+) appears in the lower right corner of that box (see #1 below).\r\n\r\n2)
    \ Click on the \"+\" with your cursor. Your cursor will change appearance to indicate
    that the overflow text is loaded into it (see #2). \r\n\r\n3) Click on an empty
    text box. The two boxes will become linked (#3). \r\n\r\nFor more info on linking
    and unlinking text boxes, go to InDesign's Help menu and select \"InDesign Help\",
    and on the help pages look in the \"Text\" section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indesign_example_5882.jpg]"
