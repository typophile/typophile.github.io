  body: the Reebok logo is the main one I&#39;m looking for - it&#39;s a more angular
    variation on Bauhaus - any ideas?

  body: found out that reebok is a custom made font as you said - found a couple of
    similar ones but none that good - I&#39;m going to edit bauhaus 93 in illustrator
    - that&#39;ll do!
