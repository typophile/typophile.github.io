  If you inspect the UC O it is not perfectly circular. All other weights are. <BR>

  body: ' Soren, <BR> <BR>Did you buy the Adobe version? Comparing the Adobe cut to
    the Bitstream cut, there seems to be a clear difference, at least in the UC O.
    <BR> <BR>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say the Bitstream cut is slightly extended,
    if not perfectly circular... but I didn&#39;t compare the O to an actual circle.

  body: 'Soren, <BR> <BR>Let me commend you on your abstinence from Futura. It&#39;s
    a &#42;parody&#42; of a typeface, and I don&#39;t care how many graphic designers
    would blacklist me for saying that. You can make all the lines &amp; circles you
    want, just don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s an adequate way of making letters, and least
    of all &#42;words&#42;. Try setting &#34;tobacco&#34; in Futura and see what you
    get... <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a variant of Futura called &#34;Steile&#34; &#40;you
    know, the one everybody and their mother is reviving now&#41;, and here&#39;s

  body: ' Hrant, <BR> <BR>I partially agree with you. You would be right if you said
    that Futura is unsuitable for making &#42;sentences&#42;. As for &#42;words&#42;,
    I haven&#39;t tried to set &#34;tobacco&#34; but I know some very nice typographic
    arrangements of Futura &#40;eps light weights&#41;. One example of that could
    be &#40;Denmark&#39;s only world-wide recognized graphic designer&#41; poster
    artist Per Arnoldi.  <BR> <BR>Arnoldi uses one trick: Primary colours, simple
    geometric shapes, Futura light, and creativity. All Bauhaus, of course - but it
    still works. And Futura works. And he is able to pay the rent, just making posters!
    Take a look: www3.famille.ne.jp/~poster-m/perarn.html <BR> <BR>I may be indisposed
    on this matter, as I graduated in 86, when the mere sight of Futura Light sent
    me into drool mode ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Soren '

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>Besides, Herb Lubalin used AvantGarde Gothic cleverly in the
    60s and 70s ... it may look 60ish and 70ish, but noone will say, I guess, that
    AvantGarde &#40;or Futura&#41; was an &#42;inadequate&#42; way of making letters.

    <BR> <BR>:P <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t help but chime in and say that Futura definately
    has had a dated flavor. But I&#39;ve seen some pretty striking uses of it that
    elevate it above the realm of trendy. <BR> <BR>While futura has a certain sterile
    quality, that trait can be just as much a design element as anything else. <BR>
