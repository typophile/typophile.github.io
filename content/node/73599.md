body: "Hey guys,\r\nI feel like I'm starting to get a fairly decent handle on font
  pairings, but I'm really kinda stuck on working with Letter Gothic. I'm trying to
  find a sans that will contrast the computer stone age look of Letter Gothic (like
  Futura vs courier), or give a little bit of the terry jones/ID magazine look. Is
  it also possible to use a serif against the slabby monospaced LG? Any ideas or suggestions
  are appreciated. Cheers,\r\nm"

    that sets well similarly open, for instance letterspaced, and most faces don't
    (after the old Goudy adage).\r\n\r\nI've used <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html\">Panoptica</a>,
    another monospaced face.\r\nIt was the other way round, I was looking for a text
    face to work with Panoptica, and discovered that Letter Gothic was OK.\r\n\r\n"
