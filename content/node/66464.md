body: "There is an old style of [[Cyrillic]], e.g. in the typeface Academy, in which
  the characters tse and shcha don't have the usual short descending mark (below left),
  but have swash tails (below right). I considered this for Scotch Modern (the face
  shown in the examples here), but abandoned the idea as inappropriate.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tails3_5225.png]\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I am presently designing a more swashy typeface, and will include swash tails on
  tse and shcha. Would such tails also be appropriate for other Cyrillic characters
  which have descenders? Specifically, the tailed versions of zhe, ka, en, ha, and
  che:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tails1_6616.png]\r\n\r\nAnd finally,
  if there is a swash descender on tse and shcha, why not on De? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tails2_6521.png]"

  body: "Interesting question. I doubt these non-Slavic Cyrillic letters ever used
    swash descenders, but I don't know much about them at all. I'd appreciate any
    information as well.\r\n\r\nAs for the De, even though the descending strokes
    end up looking similar to those of Tse or Shcha, I think of the underlying strokes
    as being fundamentally different. Taking away the descending strokes on De altogether
    would be extreme, but it will still be read as a De. But the strokes in Tse and
    Shcha are essential, and in the latter case it is the only element that distinguishes
    it from a Sha. It's like the tail of Q, which may be the only flamboyantly swashy
    detail in an otherwise sober Latin text design.\r\n\r\nIn swashy calligraphy,
    the De may acquire spectacular tails: [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/7333287@N07/4062666519/]]
    Of course, the handwritten form of lowercase de has a large tail, being superficially
    similar to a handwritten \"g\". But they feel out of place in designs for text."

    for example, is Cyrillic version of ITC Anna, De and Tse has identical descenders.
    In text font, of course, it's better to go traditional way."
