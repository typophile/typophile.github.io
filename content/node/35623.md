  body: The uppercase of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/durham-abbey-nf/"
    target="_blank">this font</a> is quite similar, but the lowercase is quite dissimilar...but

  body: The 'P' is <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/s/sentinel.htm"
    target="_blank">Sentinel</a> (the uppercase P - not the one shown in the sample
    image at the link I'm providing. You'll have to download and open the font to
    see what i mean). I'm still looking for the familiar lowercase.
