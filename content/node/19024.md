  as such but I am designing some pages for the following decades 2000, 90's, 80's,
  70's, 60's and 50's and would like to use a typeface that is commonly associated
  with each decade. \r\n\r\nA font/s that is recognised within advertising or design
  trends or some pointers as to what would work for each decade would be very much
  appreciated. As mentioned I realise that it is impossible to say this is the 50's
  but if a common theme exisits that would make that visual link for each that would
  be great.\r\n\r\nTIA"

  body: "Part of the problem is to use faces that were indicative of the decade but
    have fallen out of style, thereby invoking an era.\r\n\r\nGeoff's suggestions
    are good for the seventies.\r\nThough <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.aspx?PID=358709\"
    target=\"new\">Bottleneck</a> was released in 1972, it is strictly sixties in
    style.\r\n\r\nFor the fifties you can use anyone of several <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?advanced=1&params%5Bsearchtype%5D=normal&search%5Btext%5D=frisky&params%5Bboolean%5D=and\"
    target=\"new\">Frisky Style</a> typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut then again, you are talking
    about American styles aren't you?"

    \ both UK and USA, I appreciate what you are saying re falling out of fashion
    but I think that is part of the beauty (sort of retro feel).\r\n\r\nAnd thanks
    for the suggestions - again a couple of good ones there exactly what I was after.

    in the 80s. But for nostalgia, you want Pac-Man fonts like Shotgun and Bauhaus.

    I know I wasn't around then, but when it comes to relating what I know of the

    Applebeas adopted it for their new menus. well, at least new down here in the
