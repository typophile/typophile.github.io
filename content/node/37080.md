body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nFairly new to Typofile... Hello. The image attached is of a
  semi serif (ish) font that was an Beijing Olympics treatment that didn't make the
  grade. But does anyone know what it is?\r\n\r\nIt could have been altered, we've
  thought it's nearly Albertus, nearly Trajan... We're in the middle of a job and
  would love find out what this could be!?\r\n\r\nThanks (fingers crossed)\r\nChris
