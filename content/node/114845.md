body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book using Maiola as the main typeface.
  The book is an essay on the nature & purpose of art and an analysis of a few key
  pieces from different traditions: a Lohan, an ancient Egyptian sculpture, a Vermeer,
  a Rembrandt, etc. I feel the Czech references in Maiola suit the author and his
  conversational style. I also think it's a fine typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm using Maiola
  throughout, but for captions, space is limited. I'd like to use a condensed sans,
  but I'm struggling to find something that really complements Maiola.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    best way to go in your case though. Axia seems a very good choice. Nice typeface.
