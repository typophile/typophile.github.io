  wondering if I could get some advice for fonts and mark ideas for an online learning
  company. Just a bunch of ideas that I can use as a kick-off for trying things out
  as I'm not artistically creative at all. I'm just a software architect - not much
  of a designer - so that's pretty much on the completely other side of the spectrum
  for me."

  body: "Sadly, it is not up to me about hiring a designer. LOL. I am totally with
    you there.\r\n\r\nThe company's approach online learning is very innovative and
    different from all the other companies. Also, their solutions drastically save
    costs over traditional training, but even drastically reduce costs of current
    online training/learning solutions out there. The software they provide that lets
    organizations create learning programs or courses is ridiculously easy to use
    and is very interactive (web 2.0, lots of ajax). There's also lots of social components
    and an emphasis on mobile learning.\r\n\r\nAlso, the company name, which I'm not
    sure if I am allowed to say, is a short-snappy word of 5 letters. So I guess the
    font has to be good for that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIs that enough info? :/"

  body: Mystic, it's a really bad business decision to create your company's logo
    and visual identity that way. You need to hire a professional designer.

  body: I'm sure you're right and I agree with you... and I don't have much choice
    in the matter. I don't personally have the money so I have to do this myself.
    The actual implementation of my design skills are actually not terrible if I have
    an idea of what to do. They can actually be quite good. I'm just not artistically
    creative and all of that.

    the font has to be good for that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nI understand your hesitation
    to mention the company name, but it's unlikely that we could offer any suggestions
    that are very creative or specific to your company without knowing it. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    if you listed some of the company's qualities  that you're trying to communicate
    (a list of several adjectives, for instance), we might be able to suggest some
    fonts that have those qualities. (For example, hypothetically if someone said
    \"I'm looking for a font that's feminine, traditional, and energetic\", then that's
    a starting point for font selection.)"

  body: "Well, I can give you a sense of the benefits the product provides and who
    it's for.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a web 2.0 project, it's target audience isn't really
    20-year olds who is using facebook. On the contrary, it's established businesses
    who, believe it or not, are hiring or at least training their current employees.\r\n\r\nThe
    niche market for this product is people that want to drastically save money for
    doing customized training that is online/offsite. There's a lot of systems out
    there that offer pre-packaged learning programs all over the net, but that doesn't
    work for companies who need to create their own content for internal training/learning.
    That's basically where this software really excels. It can do the other stuff
    too, but that's not really that important from a brand point of view.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the big drawbacks with online software is that they basically suck currently.
    This service is actually quite good. For example, a non-techie can design a completely
    custom course/learning program for their organization, or for others, in literally
    fractions of the time it would take with inferior software. \r\n\r\nActually,
    a lot of the stuff you can do with this service is not even possible with current
    web learning software. It's basically crazy ajax pushing the current browsers
    to the max in terms of interactivity. \r\n\r\nBasically, it's the most innovative
    and feature rich product out there. I wish I could explain just how \"custom\"
    I'm talking about because it doesn't constrain you to build your learning material
    in any way at all. You can invent the structure, how it looks, everything, which
    is has not been done by anyone else.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, it's the smartest
    system out there. I wrote it so that it gives hints based on context and if you
    write human sentences in it (when that applies), the system does a pretty damn
    good job understanding what you told it. That's not the start feature or anything,
    but it's there for companies who want to analyze the semantics of their answers
    and go beyond drag/drop or simple fill-in-the-blanks, multiple choice, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's
    also fully socialized, unlike a lot of software. It's got tons of things to help
    everyone in the organization collaborate and integrate their training/learning.
    A lot of this kind of software that's out there right now is very isolating, where
    you interact with the computer, or at best, a live trainer. The furthest any system
    goes for actual learning is maybe chat rooms, but this thing goes a million times
    further and better.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the mobile aspect. Anyone can do all
    of this stuff from their cell phone if they want to.\r\n\r\nOh, and I guess the
    people using this software have a far likelier chance of actually learning stuff
    and retaining it. That's not really that important though because of lot of companies
    surprisingly don't care. Really, it comes to down reducing training costs drastically.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that tells you something useful :p"

  body: "Mystic, I appreciate your effort to explain further, but as far as font suggestions
    are concerned, what you've given is background info that would be useful to a
    designer who's going to spend several weeks developing your logo & identity system,
    but it's not very useful when it comes to making a few offhand font suggestions.
    \r\n\r\nIt's not like there are a bunch of fonts that communicate concepts like
    \"innovative and feature rich\" and \"fully-socialized software\".  Those are
    concepts that would be communicated mainly via your marketing plan. \r\n\r\nFont
    selection communicates more general concepts -- masculine/feminine, modern/traditional,
    static/active, simple/ornate, formal/casual, etc. Thus my suggestion previously
    that you come up with a short list of simple adjectives which tell the qualities
    you're trying to communicate via the font selection."
