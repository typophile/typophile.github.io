    Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch was printed in Rome about 1470, only 14 years

    from Italy to Spain and Constantinople with the press of Gerson and Joshua Solomon
    at Soncin near Cremona being the most active.\r\n\r\nHere are a few landmark dates

    of England as a gift\r\n1533 - Hayim ben David Schwartz moves his press from Prague
    to Augsburg Germany\r\n1542 - Beginning of censorship of Hebrew books by the Roman
    Curia\r\n1550 - Giustiniani and Bragadini enter into competition with Bomberg
    in Venice\r\n1554 - The burning of the Talmud at Ferrara and closing of the Venice
    printers\r\n1556 - First edition of Zohar is saved in Mantua but Zioni commentary

    Talmud begins to appear in Basel\r\n1627 - Gutel the daughter of Leb Setzer prints

    what I discovered recently- Muslims forbid any form of \"visualization\" of any
    living creatures and human being, since that can be associated with idolatry.
    As the result, the Muslim artists and craftmen over the century have learned to
    express their creativity mainly through calligraphy and typography. As the result
    thay become so good in this area. I assume Jews are probably in the same situation,
    since the Torah also forbids the \"idolization\" of living creatures. Ezer's work
    is the classic example of this theory. His works is so Typographical driven and
    they are so \"pure\"..."
