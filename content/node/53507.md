    as a free resource for thousands of corporate logos in vector format. \r\n\r\nWorking
    for a non-profit, we'll get a sponsor and their secretary only sends a 72ppi logo
    lifted from their website only to be tossed into a word document. \r\n\r\nNo prob.
    I'll probably find it at Brands of the World. \r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Oh man, Brands of the World is a godsend. I too work for non-profits and
    have to do the Great Logo Hunt every so often.\r\n\r\nAnother trick is to search
    for the company name along with \".pdf\" or \".eps\" in the query. You can often
    find unsecured PDFs with vector logos floating around on the web, often with PMS
    values intact. If you're lucky, you can find hard-to-find online company PR resources
    like their logos with the .eps search."
