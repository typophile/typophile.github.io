    <BR> <BR>Maybe a different cut &#40;or someone else&#39;s revival&#41; of the
    same face?'

  body: The lower case g looks out of place everywhere else the serifs are sharp,
    but the decender on the g is round. This might be customized. As Marc suggested
    the a also doesn&#39;t belong notice its slightly larger or taller than the m
    and r

  body: It looks more like the Bembo Schoolbook &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39; were the
    only letters of &#39;The Markings&#39; that came from that font. That would explain
    Dan&#39;s observation too.

    - Maybe.  <BR> <BR>BTW, this typeface is used by a publisher house. Here more
    samples.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48585.jpg" alt="4sam">

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure someone decided they wanted a &#34;dressier&#34; version
    of Stone Informal &#40;which also uses a monocameral a and single-bowl g&#41;.
    So they used Stone Serif, and borrowed the a and g from Bembo Schoolbook.

  body: MYSTERY SOLVED! <BR> <BR>It is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-stone-serif/"
    target="_blank">Stone Serif</a> with use of  special characters from Stone Serif
    Phonetic &#40;scroll down the page&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in publishing and would
    be very surprised if a book designer would actually borrow text characters from
    another font. Kind of a no-no.

  body: Nice work, Patricia. I checked the character set of Stone Serif to see if
    there were alternate characters for the a and g. Forgot all about Stone Phonetic!

    remenber the phonetic fonts. You&#39;ve been really clever. <BR> <BR>jmc _=&#43;
