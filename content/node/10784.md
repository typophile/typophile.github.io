  time</a> around, join us for another round of <b>Six Degrees of Stephen Coles!</b>
  <BR> <BR>Ok, up for the challenge?  <BR> <BR>Starting at a site in which Stephen
  Coles is a guest editor, can you connect our beloved type deity Mr. Coles with a
  &#34;patriotically attired Chihuahua&#34; in exactly 5 clicks? <BR> <BR>Whoever
  posts the answer first gets to post the next challenge. <BR> <BR><i>And of course,
  thanks to Stephen for letting us have some fun affirming his position at the center
  of the type universe.</i>
