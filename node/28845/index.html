		<div class="commentbody">The font shown and known as "Helvetica" was designed by Max Miedinger in 1937. The first production of the types was done 1957 by Haas'sche Giesserei in Switzerland and they called it "Haas-Grotesk".
They offered Haas-Grotesk mager (regular), halbfett (bold) and kursiv (italic). The link in the first posting does not show these informations.

4 years later, in 1961, D.Stempel, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, bought Haas'sche Giesserei.

And 1961, D.Stempel called this font "Helvetica".
And Stempel was it, who designed lots of other versions of Helvetica.
This font was the No. 1 of Grotesk fonts in Germany (West Germany) for more than 20 years. Much more successful as e.g. Folio-Grotesk from Bauersche Giesserei or Akzidenz-Grotesk from H. Berthold. Every german printer who wanted to have a good position in his local market, used Helvetica. Because it is very easy to combine Helvetica with other fonts, which are no Grotesk.

If you are interested to see more of original Helvetica from Stempel, please visit:
http://www.bleisetzer.de/index.php?target=shop/shop&b=0004

May be that pre-press professionals from today think Helvetica is boring. But Helvetica did a very good job in the past.

The problem I think many of us, myself included, have is that over its life, it has been  (a) overused and (b) frequently set poorly by people who don't know any better.  Even the best filet mignon tastes like shoe leather if you cook it improperly.

I understand what you mean.
And I for myself think the same about Folio-Grotesk and/or Lithographia. Because I used it too much for years. But this is my personal problem and it cannot mean that both fonts are overused.
A fact is: The Helvetica is a very harmonic font.

And what I wanted to say is: The informations on this website about Helvetica are wrong or, better, not correct.

<em>I kind of like the straight lined Helvetica</em>

This image reminds me of the old issue with Berthold's proprietary postscript fonts; back in the 80s, Berthold optimised their postscript library so their typefaces would only image smoothly on Berthold imagesetters – if you ran it out on a Linotronic it would look all 'crunchy' and straight-sided round the curves. 

I once saw this effect on a theatre poster and couldn't tell if it had been done intentionally or not... it did make the type look more interesting, in a postmodernist 'oh no! the technology's s**ffed it up again' kind of a way.

		<div class="commentbody">This time, i have to correct more than one mistake:

As Bleisetzer has already written. Miedinger is spelled thus, not Meidinger as on the website. And Helvetica is not the Latin name of the country, but Helvetia is. In fact, their car plates say CH, for Confederatio Helvetia. 

The name was, indeed, coined by Stempel in Frankfurt – by one of their salesmen, Herr Eul (i attach his original letter with the proposal). He suggested Helvetia (sic), but that name was deemed unusable. The new Haas Grotesk was designed in 1957, not 1937. After the war, Swiss designers favoured Akzidenz Grotesk from Berthold in Germany, so Haas needed to fight back. The foundry commissioned Max Miedinger, also a salesman, to design a new Akzidenz Grotesk, but more neutral. Bingo. 

20 years later, Günter Gerhard Lange at Berthold undertook the same job: he redesigned AG and called the result Akzidenz Grotesk Buch, which looks like Helvetica with some AG features like oblique terminals.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica_letter_3838.jpg]</div>

Helvetica is famous because it is interesting. (It's naive to belive that anything get famous if vacuous, ask any marketeer.)

It is interesting thanks to it's flexibility and legibility. It is also the result of a daring marketing strategy which however made it pretty much synonym with swiss design and also gained the status of being Swizerlands house type.

Helvetia is the Latin word for Switzerland, Helvetius -a -um and Helveticus -a -um are the corresponding adjectives (both versions of the adjective are found in Caesar).

		<div class="commentbody">In the letter, Eric posted, Mr. Eul, Marketing Manager of D.Stempel, told the general management about the current situation of Grotesk fonts in Germany. He says there was a kind of very famous fashion wave(?) of "Swiss Typography" (Schweizer Typographie). This does not mean only the fonts but the "modern" designs, realized by Grotesk fonts.

So he, Mr. Eul, wanted to find a name which the customers, the printers, associate with Switzerland, Swiss design. The general management thought "Helvetia" was is already used by Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Railway) for a special train. This "Helvetica" was the first one which connected Hamburg in the very north of Germany with Zurich (Switzerland) with only a few stops in between. 

So they decided to call the font "Helvetica". And got no trouble with the german government (railway).

I think you’re confusing Swiss design with design in the country (or more accurately confederation) known as Switzerland. Helv may be associated with “Swiss design”, but I think Frutiger’s types (Univers and Frutiger) are Switzerland’s signature types.

Was Helvetica modelled only on Akzidenz Grotesk, or did Miedinger use also the 'Breite Grotesk' by Schelter & Giesecke as a model? Are there any proofs for this claim, or are these only based on similarity?

Here's the first appearance of the Breite Grotesk by Schelter & Giesecke 
(the 'Magere' weight only) in
Typographische Mitteilungen, 3. Band 4. Heft 1890, p 673

(In 'Handbuch der Schriftarten' you can read that the Breite Magere Grotesk dates from 1870, but this is clearly wrong)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schelter_4528.jpg]</div>

Actually the spud-faced nipper is Wayne Rooney, and although I don't have much good to say about him in the way he conducts himself both on and off the pitch, he is well-known, in the UK at least, because he is a sportsman, he is not famous for being famous, I'm sure we can all imagine a better example of that level of vacuousness.

Breite Grotesk looks too characterful to have been the source for Helvetica, but I suppose if one was trying to iron out any "humanity" it could be an inspiration.

People buy letterpress fonts in my online shop.
Mostly they are printers. All of them love the old letterpress stuff.
They spend their money buying fonts from Group VII - Antiqua Varianten and Group VIII - Schreibschriften (DIN 16 518). But very often they forget to buy fonts like Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Folio-Grotesk. After a year or so they start to ask for e.g. Helvetica. Because they learned that they need it.

You need fonts for the standard text. To make special fonts more important. If you only use special fonts, its confusing and does not look nice.

Helvetica was a very good solution for all these standards.
This was a well working font. The glamour was given to others. But Helvetica did the job.

My point was that <em>glamour</em> was removed for Helvetica, and it does the job in its place (although given a choice I would use Univers) however its place is limited and <strong>that</strong> is not always appreciated by designers.

I didn't say that, I was offering a possible explanation for Nick's posting of the ad (Sorry Wayne and David for the mix-up). Personally I'm completely neutral on Helveti(c)a.

		<div class="commentbody">My point about the vacuousness of brand advertising has been made by the discussion of Rooney, not Nike. The actual merit of the product, or even what it is, is irrelevant, and that is the case with Helvetica's fame. People who are barely familiar with typoography and couldn't tell Helvetica from Comic Sans, and who are unaware that the sample has rendered in straight lines, have an awareness of "Helvetica".

Yesterday I heard the results of a focus group for a newspaper redesign, for which I am providing all-new fonts. Of the focus group, only one fellow mentioned the text type (so I must be doing ok!) -- "Yes, it's Courier," he said, "No," (quite categorically) "It's Times." I suspect he would have identified any sans serif as Helvetica.</div>

Given that the product might actually have contributed to an injury that almost (oh, why didn't it?) kept Rooney out of the World Cup they would prefer that their logo was ignored. More to the point though it was more a "c'mon Inger-land"-type advertisement than a "buy Nike, they will improve your footballing skills" advertisement, so the emphasis was not on any product.

That is the story of consumer advertising for at least a hundred years.
The myth is more important than the reality.
Similarly, Helvetica's "neutrality" for typographers is no longer a purely formal quality (if it ever was), but operates at the level of myth, as explained here:


Why do you use Helvetica ?
There are many reasons why we use Helvetica. Each is very different and sometimes seemingly contradictory, and they slowly but constantly change. Some of these reasons may be hard to follow, but we like to believe that it is exactly the complicated nature of our reasoning that, paradoxically, makes our designs so practical and clear.
One of these reasons involves Helvetica’s neutrality. Of course, we fully realize that no typeface is neutral, and that Helvetica’s objectivity is a myth. But it is exactly this myth that turned Helvetica into one of the most widely used typefaces in the first place. So it is fair to speak of a myth that created its own reality. In that sense, Helvetica’s neutrality resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. This neutrality, real or imagined, enables us and the user to fully focus on the design as a whole, neutralizing the typographic layer as a way to keep the concept as clear and pure as possible. There are cases, however, where for specific reasons, the concept demands a less neutral typographic layer. In those cases we never hesitate to use other typefaces. But those cases are rare.

You're right, of course. I can distinguish a noun from an adjective in Latin (did 9 years at school), but this was an oversight. Which proves that one shouldn’t write such important documents at some unearthly time in the middle of the night. 

The fact remains that Helvetica is <em>not</em> the name of the country.</div>
