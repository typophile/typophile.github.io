body: 'First time posting on this list but I have been lurking for months. I am also
  mostly a typography novice, hence my questions. <BR> <BR>I am a cartographer working
  on a re-design of a large scale topographic map &#40;1:50k&#41;. This is a large
  sheet 28&#34; x 40&#34; with a 4 color CMYK tiff with type and line work printing
  over that in black and two spot colors: a blue and a greyish brown. Large quantities
  of single line small type blocks in the 5 or 6pt range and usually 4 to 6 letters
  long need to be placed. But some may be longer and two to three lines long. Some
  text may also be 8pt to 10pt in size. In the past this was set in Arial. I am looking
  to change this. I want to use a sans serif family for most of it, with a well matched
  serif or semi-sans for some place names and water bodies. I realise this may be
  a bit off-topic for this list but I really enjoy the tone of the discussion here
  and though I would solicit your informed opinions.  <BR> <BR>Legibility is very
  important, and there is a good chance text will need to be converted to paths at
  some point in the printing process.  <BR> <BR>BTW I am loathe to use Bell Centennial.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been recommended Frutiger and Amasis. Anyone else with some suggestions?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks'

    replacement using <i>dice</i> and you&#39;d still do better!  :-/ <BR> <BR>You
    should look for a font that&#39;s been designed for small sizes - and it doesn&#39;t
    have to be something bland. Look at the work of Chris Burke: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/"

    if you want something more extreme maybe Tracy&#39;s Adsans: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adsans/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adsans/</a> <BR> <BR>As
    for a companion semi/serif design, that would depend on the &#40;more pivotal&#41;
    small-text choice. Although Amasis -which I&#39;d never heard about- could actually
    work out. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
