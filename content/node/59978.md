  I have. \r\n\r\nCan someone please ID this font for me? I thought it was FF Meta,
  but it seems that is not the case as the Q is different and the font is less condensed.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for any help you can give me!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nHuggy"

  body: "Hi Renko,\r\n\r\nToday Sans looks like a match to me. The \"R\" is straight.\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface is definitely based on the P22 Underground (or Johnston) i.e. the \"London
    Tube Typeface\", which EF Today Sans is, and also the i - dot is not just a circle
    like Agenda for instance.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
