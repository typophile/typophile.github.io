  body: I can help with background and dates.It was a quote developed during the time
    of using the typositor for phototypesetting headlines. Herb Lubalin, Aaron Burns
    and ITC were clients of ours who often required the careful and considered placement
    of one letter next to the other. We had to take into account the positive and
    negative space between letters. This was being done in a red light safe darkroom,
    exposing each letter one at a time and watching it develop under a "glass" which
    held liquid photo developer. Being a flirtatious man, my father came up with that
    quote during that period which was around 1985-1986. A couple of years later he
    became a consultant for a few companies including Adobe in their earliest years.
    That quote can be found in one of Adobe's first specimen books "Adobe Type Guide,
    Volume 1"
