body: Hello there. <BR> <BR>Small job here. It&#39;s an outdoor signage &#40;2,4x0,40m&#41;
  on acrilic &#43; steel. This beautiful logo will be printed on vinyl and applied
  on the back side of the acrilic revealing a grey steel back as filling color &#40;white
  space&#41;. I&#39;ve choosen NEUTRAFACE as the type due to the... her... strange
  geometric concepts of the PAC logo. Any sugestion? I just can&#39;t ignore the logo

    It can be a crude method but sometimes seeing what something looks like in context
    will show you that an otherwise wonderful design doesn&#39;t work in a specific
    space or place. I&#39;d like to see the materials simulated too. That will tell
    you a great deal too. <BR> <BR>Regarding the design itself - I like what you have
    done. It&#39;s seems very restrained &amp; helpful rather than being showy. It&#39;s
    a good contrast with the logo. Having nice geometric Os does tie into the existing
    logo nicely. It seems responsible &amp; I mean that with respect.
