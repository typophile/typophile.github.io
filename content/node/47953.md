    is a XML template-driven way to produce customized PDF font books :-) <a href="http://www.fontmatrix.net">FontMatrix</a>
    is a cross platform font manager - written with Qt and licensed as free & open
    source software under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU GPL</a>. It recently
    had a big release with a <a href="http://www.fontmatrix.net/archives/mac/>packaged
    Mac OS X version</a> and also a <a href="http://www.fontmatrix.net/archives/win/">packaged
    windows version</a> :-)

    Type Book Creator</a> today. Looks like it has some good presets and a few customization
    options. Give it a go and let us know how it works.
