  of tests with Werner Lemberg's work-in-progress 'ttfautohint' tool.\r\n\r\nThe aim
  of my tests is to compare Windows GDI and DirectWrite output of ttfautohint hinted
  fonts against the original hinted fonts.\r\n\r\nIn general the tool is working well,
  but naturally some glitches to still iron out. Lazy person auto-instructing for
  truetype fonts, comparable to manual instructing, could be in reach.\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "I think that most of the autohinter outputted fonts produces slightly more
    compact text horizontally, i.e. slightly shorter lines.\r\n\r\nAt some small ppem
    the autohinted output creates taller x height, or is it the manual hinting creating
    a shorter x-height?\r\n\r\nThe first test version of ttfautohint was tending to
    flatten curves somewhat at certain ppem sizes - a good example is the shot you
    linked to above. That issue has now been reduced and is still being improved upon.
    \ As i understand the problem, GDI has more agressive vertical filtering compared
    to OSX Quartz or Freetype. GDI agressively switches stray pixels outside snap
    zones to white and inside zones to black, to give that typical ClearType sharpness
    at baseline etc. The key will be to tweak the autohinter to output instructions
    to give a tiny bit less harsh rendering."

    in this case makes things shorter, but it could also make it larger. The point
    is, the x-height is a decision that a human made. I think that having control
    over the height zones would be an important option with the autohinter. \r\n\r\nJason"

    \ Likely to be many many lesser tweaks rather than one miraculous tweak.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the goal is not about the emulation of manual hinting. GDI was perfectly suited
    to needing labour intensive human intervention to give satisfactory font rendering.
    DirectWrite seems not hungry for it, which makes sense looking at the way the
    OS is going."
