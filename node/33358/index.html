  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have looked everywhere. The closest I have gotten is ITC Tiffany, but on close look the serifs are off and the e has an extra serif on the top right edge. The main difference from Tiffany is that the serifs in Tiffany are rounded on the tips and they are squared in the logo. The serifs are a little different in length and angle as well.

I have researched Tiffany's heritage (Ronaldson and Caxton) with no clues.

Please if anyone has any ideas what it may be, I would be very greatful.

Thank you!

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure of its age, but the company goes back to the 1800's. The company claims the logo is very old.

I agree that it really looks like Tiffany, but the thing that is odd is that it didn't LOOSE detail in digitizing, it GAINED detail. An example is the additional serif on the upper lip of the e in Tiffany. It is not there on the older logo font.

There is no vector version of their logo anywhere. I have tried in vain to locate one. Everyone just keeps saying it's very old...

I had hoped I could simply trace the horse C and lay in Tiffany to get an honest vector version of the logo. Now I have to think about digital hand tracing the entire logo or trying to rework Tiffany to match.  AARGH!

I appreciate your efforts one and all.

		<div class="commentbody">It's probably based on Ronaldson Oldstyle, which is one of the models used for Tiffany. I can't quickly find a modern digitization, but there's probably one out there somewhere.

In any case, the specific image you posted shows pretty clear signs of being digitally traced. My guess is that the logo started life as Ronaldson and was then cleaned up.

Incidentally, the original Ronaldson has a straight 'e'. I'm not sure where Tiffany's slanted one came from - perhaps the same source as this logo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your logo looks like it was created from a vector file, which is what I meant when I said some details were lost. If the person doing the digitization didn't know the logo was based on Tiffany, or didn't have a digital copy to use, they could have overlooked some details such as the 'e' serif, especially if they were digitizing from a reproduction of a reproduction.

		<div class="commentbody">UPDATE:

Just spoke with my wife, who represents this company in the US. Apparently the le Crin company (which makes textiles from horse hair tail) dates back to the end of Napoleon's time (1814). My wife was in the archives in France not long ago and found a document from well before the turn of the century. She just told me it had nearly the same logo on it. In fact most I speak with in France believe this is the original logo.

Obviously I can stop looking for the font, but what's interesting to me is that the logo is so very similar to Tiffany, yet the logo with the tilted e (almost identical in every way save the lip serif) pre-dates Tiffany by about 150 years. The le Crin company was founded in 1814. Tiffany was designed by Edward Benguiat in 1974.

If I am not mistaken the top of the influence design tree (Ronaldson) dates from around the same time as the founding of le Crin. Yet, Ronaldson or Claxton do not have a tilted e. It makes me wonder about the history of tilting the e? Is it part of a movement or maybe a signature foundry style?

Anyway, thank you to all who contributed.

		<div class="commentbody">The logo may have evolved over the years, changing subtly while still retaining the feel of the original. The Napoleonic version of the logo would probably look the same to most casual observers, but I would bet it uses a different typeface, and most likely a slightly different version of the horse.

Take a look at the Coca-Cola logo or the Ford motors logo. These have stayed essentially the same since they were designed way back when, but if you compare a version from today with the original, you'll find many differences.
