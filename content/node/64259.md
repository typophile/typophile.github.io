  starting up her own small local record label. Only problem is that out of the sketches
  that I showed her, this was the one that she happened to like. Three weeks later
  I notice that it looks phallic. Anyone have any ideas? The name of the record label
  is Black Catalyst Records. Long text to work with. Yet another design challenge.

    agree with Michael about the 'b' being \"off\". I think you should either chop
    up a real 'b' instead of using a flipped 'c', or else rotate the 'c' 180 degrees
    instead of flipping it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    with the changes. I do like reducing the ascender of the d which will make it
    a lot easier for me to work with placing it with text. The curves added with the
    original letter b give more motion as well. "

    wouldn't worry too much about it being phallic: if you look for enough time at
    any given symbol, at the end you can always find out some sexual innuendo! ;-)"

  body: "It's a decent enough idea, and I don't see a problem. Revisit Lex's comments.
    Mirroring the c is causing the b to look bad, the additional little rotation is
    not helping -- just falling over. Start by rotating 180 only, and redrawing as
    needed, but keeping the same angle of modulation (thick/thin flow).\r\n\r\nThe
    *ahem* head serif on the b could be given more emphasis to the left and jac's
    suggestion of hard edges would completely remove any anatomical reference.\r\n\r\ndb
    thanks for the laugh."

    name: cpaluch04
  body: She's starting out with more of a alternative rock clientele and trying to
    stem out from that. She wants a versatile group of local bands so she wants to
    not be niche specific.

  body: If the core of the label is alternative bands, this logo maybe doesn't fit
    the target. It feels very much about connectivity, parts fitting together, positive
    and negative space, which are all great things, but something that I would expect
    more for a non-profit or a corporate client. Of course alternative can mean a
    million things (and you could debate if it ever meant anything in the 90s). I'm
    not suggesting you should do market research on alternative labels -- I love the
    K shield (http://www.kpunk.com/), but doing something similar would be cheap and
    lazy. Naive hand-drawn stuff has been done to death, particularly in the indie/alternative
    world, but in the 80s I'd imagine their logo seemed pretty innovative and subversive.
    So with this logo, maybe you make it look extremely corporate, contrasting with
    the fact that it's a tiny record label. I would just go back and ask her what
    kind of things she wants the label to represent, and go from there.
