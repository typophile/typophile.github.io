  body: Most of their typography is derived from modifying existing typefaces. If
    you give a specific example I'm sure someone here could sort it out.

    It depends on the typeface. Sometimes we work quite quickly and they\u2019re exactly
    what we want for the job. Others need more work.\r\n<strong>KE</strong>: Some
    won\u2019t be the whole alphabet either, just the letters that you need. Then
    later you might go back to them.\r\n<strong>JF</strong>: It might look great for
    the letters you need but might not for the rest of the alphabet. We had that with
    the Wire \u2013 we hoped and prayed that they wouldn\u2019t write a headline with
    a Z in it! We didn\u2019t have one.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/dear-non-format/\"><strong>CR
