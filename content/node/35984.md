  body: "This is an old Image Club font called 'Hairpin' that has been obliqued. I
    do not think this font is still sold, but I can post a sample of it, if you want
    to see it (have to restart first though). Grant Hutchinson could vouch for this
    one, as an old Image Club guy.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
