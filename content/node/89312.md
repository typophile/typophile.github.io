body: "SVG was once touted as an alternative to Postscript as an interchange format
  for vector graphics. While SVG support continues to grow slowly in web browsers,
  page-oriented projects like Adobe's PDFXML (Mars) and W3C's SVG Print seem to be
  all dead.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find good discussions of SVG's failure to
  penetrate the print market. Programmers' forums mix zealotry for anything \"free\"
  with total ignorance of graphic arts practice. Forums for graphic design tools have
  almost no mention of SVG.\r\n\r\nAny one here know much about the merits of SVG?
  I assume there are marketing reasons for the non-takeup of SVG, but I'm really just
  concerned with the technical aspect. Even just pointers to discussions elsewhere
  would be good.\r\n\r\nI want to programmatically generate graphics for inclusion
  in print documents. These figures would include significant amounts of text and
  equations. As far as I can see, the only serious options for a target format are
  EPS and SVG. I think SVG would be a lot easier to handle, but it seems that graphic
  designers only use EPS. So I'm wondering if I would eventually regret orienting
  my toolset around SVG."
