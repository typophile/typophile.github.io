body: Hello folks, <BR>This is an interesting one so hope there&#39;s some Blackletter/Lombardic
  guru&#39;s out there. The closest I could get was Cloister Black or Monotype&#39;s
  Old English but there are some unusual characteristics like the dot of the &#39;i&#39;.
  It comes from a certificate done in the UK but I&#39;m fairly sure it was not hand
  drawn. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19427.gif" alt="icsa">

  body: It looks like David is right. Check the inconsistencies  <BR>in the e&#39;s
    of &#34;Secretaries&#34; for example. And notice  <BR>the big difference with
    the e in &#34;The&#34;. Anyone up for  <BR>a game of near-matches?
