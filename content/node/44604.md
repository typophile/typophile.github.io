  Below is a representation of where I've arrived with my client after several alternative
  directions being pursued and rejected. I have identified (framed) the design that
  my client has selected from our elliptical choices. Aside from the obvious need
  to smooth some curves, please help me identify any other problem areas and offer
  up any color suggestions. The top two options are colors that I presented, while
  the bottom two are client requested variatinos. Thank you in advance for your assistance
  ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HH_Logo_3674.jpg]\r\n\r\nFYI: The
  business provides a service aimed at helping a husband by digitally delivering romantic
  ideas to strengthen their relationship with their wife. The mark must cross gender
  lines, but may be more heavily weighted toward the masculine side.\r\n\r\nMahalo,\r\nScott"

    sportscenter or on a can of beer; it's very masculine.  Additionally, I don't
    get a sense of romance in it at all.  It kind of has a blade-like quality to it,
    which isn't very sexy or romantic.  I would come up with some more ideas to pitch
    to the client.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I was hesitant to post much
    more info, due to NDA, but I have clearance from my client to be a little more
    forthcoming. Perhaps some of this info will pacify some of this critique (or maybe
    not).\r\n\r\nThe business is titled *[Business name removed by request] and has
    very much of an \"average Joe with hero inside\" approach. HH will provide monthly
    emails of pre-planned romantic ideas and reminders that enable husbands to easily
    sweep their wives off their feet ... and, yes, it's sad but true that \"such a
    service is actually required\" for some of us. Really, it's more of a helpful
    resource than a requirement.\r\n\r\nEarly in our process, we pushed the super
    hero direction pretty far, and later in the process we explored a series of these
    chest emblem type of designs. That is why this may look a bit sporty, and I may
    have understated the appeal to our masculine audience. At this point, we won't
    be heading in a different conceptual direction, but my client (though satisfied
    with the logo, as is) is open to some minor tweaking. Also, I presented several
    color choices that included reds (for romance), but so far, none have been accepted.
    Most of my original color options offered a male/female two-tone color combo.
    My client really likes blues and blue/gray combos. (I'm presenting to a very masculine
    Harvard grad ... but we've come a long way from this project's inception)\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your comments ... I'd love to hear more.\r\n\r\nAloha,\r\nScott"

    you for not spewing out ALL of this info from the beginning ... I could've written
    an epic novel on this particular project), the mark has been presented both with
    and without the gray strokes and the disappearing outer ellipses. The client likes
    the gray stroke, feeling that it helps to separate the \"H's\" and he likes the
    disappearing outer ellipses which he feels represent an outer force-field or protective
    ring. Right or wrong, I have to appreciate a client who critiques art with valid
    reason vs. preferential opinion.\r\n\r\nKeep the comments coming. So far, they
    validate some of the arguments I have presented to my client previously; and,
    if I am convinced it is necessary, I may revisit some of them with him ... with
    a stronger appeal the second time.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "I don't mind the gray strokes, but the warmth/coolness of them needs to be
    taken into consideration. As they are now, I like how they look with on the right-most,
    but the others they smudge and are muddy. The swashy lines are not defined enough
    at this point and I feel like they are almost an afterthought. Maybe unnecessary?\r\n\r\nThe
    top right is working the best for me only because the blue and green are they
    same tone so there is an evenness. But I think the gray outline needs to be darker
    on that one. \r\n\r\nNice to see you back, Scott. "

    If you had warmer colors with a warmer grey (darker too) of equal tone it would

    addition to trying to smooth out a couple of curves, below is a response to Tiffany's
    comments. I've tried to add some weight to the outer \"swashy lines\" on the first.
    These lines remain thin on the second, as the grey relates to the stroke. The
    third shows the mark without the outer ellipse. I think the question of whether,
    or not, to include these outer lines will be answered as I experiment with the
    interaction of the mark with the title, \"*[Business name removed by request]\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HH_Logo_Ellipses_3875.jpg]\r\n\r\nI

    often read poorly in written form.  You ought not take me so seriously, particularly
    on the \"client who has no taste\" part.  Tongue was firmly inserted in cheek
    when I typed that.\r\n\r\nOn the count of the outside ellipse representing the
    protection of marriage, while the association may exist in the mind of your client,
    I doubt very much that the average viewer would wind up with that idea unless
    it were explained to him or her.  I don't have anything against \"protecting marriage,\"
    (as a married guy, it is not a completely alien concern to me), I just don't buy
    that those ellipses are so essential to the logo that if they were missing that
    concept would be lost completely.\r\n\r\nAs concerns these latest treatments:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
    top one doesn't work as well as the bottom two.</li>\r\n<li>The color of outside
    curves in the middle one lends more of a superhero feel to it.  They're no longer
    as blade-like.  I like it.</li>\r\n<li>The middle one is a good compromise if
    your client won't budge on the outside ellipse element.</li>\r\n<li>The bottom
    one loses the sense of motion that the top two have, although I think Chris's
    suggestion may address that.  Still, I like the bottom one better than the top
    one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    good suggestion ... I was fixated on using the brand colors on the type because
    I know the logotype will appear independent of the mark at times; however, instead
    of always using the spectrum, I can just do that when it is independent of the
    mark; and, even then, the application layouts may easily lend to accomplishing
    the branding vs. multi-colored logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all of your comments.
