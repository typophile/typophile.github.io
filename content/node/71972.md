  be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML.
  As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use
  of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that
  is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML
  is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex
  queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times
  but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used
  by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML
  is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions.
  Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt
  to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins,
  and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls
  into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and
  ritual infanticide. The &lt;center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex
  and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much
  watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous
  ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed
  in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n\u200Berves
  of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.
  Rege\u033F\u0314\u0309x-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow
  <em>it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved</em> the trangession of a chi\u0361ld
  ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as
  previously prophesied) <em>dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge</em>
  using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and

    certainly use them, but I think James has been making display faces so far. They
    are mostly needed in text faces. When used in titling, they mostly occur in situations
    where a text face (including text-suitable sans) would be used for the titles."
