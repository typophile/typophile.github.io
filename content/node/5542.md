    target="_blank"> not it</a>. <BR> <BR>Looking at how badly this masthead was designed,
    I guess  <BR>somebody simply took a ruler and had a go at it. The widths  <BR>of
    the characters all are identical, the curves join the straight  <BR>lines in a
    mathematically clumsy way, there&#39;s no optical  <BR>correction whatsoever...
    Definitely not a font.
