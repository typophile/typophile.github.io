    <BR> <BR>This raises the interesting question: what is the difference between
    unicase and uncial? Disturbance, while not in the style of any traditional Latin
    uncial script, follows the same pattern of ascending and descending letters. Is
    uncial a sub-class of unicase, or something different?'

  body: Stephen Coles, <BR> <BR>I appreciate the your link to my Bodoni 26. <a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaWonders.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/GiampaWonders.html</a> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html</a> <BR> <BR>Just for the
    record. I do not agree with Bradbury&#39;s concept of one alphabet. I designed
    Bodoni 26 for commercial purposes. In that regard it has served the Lanston Type
    Company very well. Personally I find the Finnish transitional type designs of
    far more interest than &#34;grinding Bradbury&#39;s axe&#34;. <BR> <BR>I predict
    Finnish transitional types would be commercially doomed. <BR> <BR>Although Bodoni
    26 is a great success it my speculation that it&#39;s popularity is because of
    its&#39; utility and novelty, not for a profound sympathy towards the politics.
    As Nick would say, &#34;it is a happy accident&#34;.

  body: Do you mean didn&#39;t uncial precede unicase? As terms, yes, but since uncial
    lettering has a single case that includes forms that relate to both preceding
    majuscule and later miniscule forms, I&#39;m wondering if it would be considered
    a subset of a more general classification of unicase alphabets, which also includes
    other single-case, non-uncial designs. Or is there some significant difference
    between uncial and unicase. For example, would anyone consider deliberate intent,
    i.e. rejection of bicameral norms, as a fundamental criterion for unicase? If
    so, that would limit the unicase category to designs that historically follow
    the establishment of the bicameral alphabet as the normal way of writing the Latin
    script.
