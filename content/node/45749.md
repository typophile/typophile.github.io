  best spot for getting names of fonts seen around town.  I'm hoping someone can help
  a brother out on this one.  I want to know what the name of the main font used on
  this month's Saveur cover as well as the accompanying fonts.  Also, where is the
  best place to get buy them.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nIan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crab_6197.jpg]"

    web project, never looked so closely at the two together.  If I liked it once,
    I guess that is why it caught my eye again.  LOL\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\n\r\nIan"
