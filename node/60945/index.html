  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a graphic design student, and we&rsquo;ve currently been given a project to design a restaurant identity. Now, I&rsquo;ve chosen quite a complex theme - it&rsquo;s hard to describe - just think &ldquo;grandma&rdquo; &ldquo;cozy cafe&rdquo; &ldquo;arts&rsquo;n&rsquo;crafts&rdquo; &ldquo;vintage/retro&rdquo;. So my idea is focusing somewhat on pretty decorative features but not heavily so. I don&rsquo;t like the tacky flowery crockery idea if you get me!</p>
<p>Anyway, so after a few concepts, I&rsquo;ve come up with this (semi final) logo design, and I want to know what you think. I have had some positive feedback from peers, but I&rsquo;d like some more harsh and detailed criticm, you know? I&rsquo;ve added the full poster image too, so you get more of a taste of the look I&rsquo;m trying to get.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only at a rough draft stage, so not much attention to detail has been paid. I want to know if the typeface design is okay, if I should vertically align the text (I have it aligned so that the slopes of the two beginning and end initials align on an angle) or keep it the way I have it, and whether or not the bird even looks ok.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time :)</p>
<p>Samantha</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it has a ton of potential and you&rsquo;re surely on the right track. The font matches both the mark and the concept rather well. I like the way the thorns relate to the font, but they&rsquo;re not quite unified yet. Perhaps three refined thorns would be enough?</p>
<p>There are some technical problems. I suggest you mock up a business card and center the logo in it, then print it at actual size. You expose so much that way! IMO, printing different sizes is a very important exercise in logo development. Logos need to be readable at two inches (or even less) and if the mark becomes a blob when it&rsquo;s small, it&rsquo;s no longer doing it&rsquo;s job. If it needs to be big to show off it&rsquo;s true character, it&rsquo;s just not working, either.</p>
<p>Lastly, the bird illustration is cute, but it feels kinda clip-arty. See what you can do to make sure it feels unique and stands out from the &hellip; ahh, flock. There are a million ways to draw birds, so look around. A website with tons of unique bird art is: <a href="http://www.weebirdy.com/birdies/">http://www.weebirdy.com/birdies/</a></p>
<p>Good luck, and keep us updated with your revisions!</p>

<p>I would simplify the bird and the branch though because many details are going to get lost when smaller.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with the thorn comment. Maybe a few tight thorns would be better. Less barbed wiry? I&rsquo;m also not usually a fan of tracked out lowercase letters either. I don&rsquo;t mind them so much here, but did you try playing around with small caps to acheive the same spaced out and light effect?</p>
<p>In the case of the bird, I agree with the above as well. At small sizes he&rsquo;ll become a blob of indiscernible black. maybe try opening up the tail white a bit and the other whites throughout as well. But yes, this mark is definitely headed down a nice path.</p>
<p>For your poster, maybe try a dar gray mixed with a touch of color to soften up that harsh black on those soft pink colors. I think it will mesh better and feel truer with your layout</p>
