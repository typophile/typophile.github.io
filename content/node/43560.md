    (sorry, I hate it when Spanish-speakers call fonts \"fuentes\" which actually
    means either fountain or source :)  )\r\n\r\n1. You may install it on one printer
    or other print/reproduction device as well as one computer.\r\n2. For use on more
    than one machine or other device where the font is copied into a storage device
    you must by subsequent licenses.\r\n3. You may not make any copies except for
    one backup copy, and you may not transfer or sell the license to anyone else.\r\n4.
    No returns unless it's defective, and only then with receipt and within 1 week
    of purchase.\r\n5. Any works using Latinotype fonts must be used under the respective
    licenses, therefore vector products must travel with a license.  Embedding is
    not allowed, if necessary the user must request an embedding license.\r\n6. Users
    must give credit to LatinoType\u2122 as a registered trademark and the holder
    of copyright for the font.\r\n7. Any violation terminates the license and you
    must return the font as well as a letter in writing that no other copy exists.\r\n8.
    LatinoType takes no responsibility for damages resulting from the use of the software.\r\nThe
    contract is under international and Chilean intellectual property laws and by
    either installing or downloading the fonts you agree that you have read understand

    as a registered trademark and the holder of copyright for the font\r\n\r\n\r\nEULA
    point No. 6 can be read in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. (the strict interpretation): In
    every use, let's say on a business card, you must credit Latinotype\u2122 (printing
    the foundry name on the card) and indicate Latinotype\u2122 as the copyright holder.
    Obviously this as impractical as it is illogical. I'd be genuinely surprised if
    this is the correct interpretation of the EULA. Nobody is going to put a foundry
    name on a poster, packaging, or title sequences. :|\r\n\r\n2. (the logical interpretation)
    When Latinotype is mentioned in print, in a colophon, in some liner notes, please
    indicate the \u2122 and \xA9 whenever appropriate.\r\n\r\nLatinotype\u2122  does
    not appear to have been registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office, but
    maybe it has been registered with the Chilean PTO maybe? \r\n\r\nIn the U.S.,
    \u2122 can be used at any time, even without federal registration, to put others
    on notice that you are claiming rights in the mark.\r\n\xAE is used when a Trademark
    has been officially registered after going through the required steps with the

    you can do this or can't do that.  Although I think the intent of #6 is to say
    when crediting, please credit it like exactly as shown with the TM symbol as opposed
    to crediting the individual designer (like Janus indicated), it's not the most
    clear thing.  (Aside for Janus: \xABsus referentes\xBB in this case means more
    or less references, or perhaps \"points/places of reference\".  I would take this
    to mean the web-design credits, for instance)\r\n\r\nKegler makes a good point
    about having EULAs in multiple languages, but in this case it really needs to
    be rewritten for both English and Spanish users' sakes.\r\n\r\nThe problem is
    that the \"y\" (and) is not really well defined as to what it's joining, it could
    be creating a second object of the verb \xABgive credits\xBB or it could be adding
    a second object under the preposition \xABcomo\xBB (as) or it could be a second
    obligation creating a sentence fragment.  Unfortunately all three areas sound
    odd given that the second \xABcomo\xBB (<em>as</em> the only distributor) doesn't
    really seem to be well attached. Janus assumed an additional \xABy\xBB (and) with
    his comma placement but it's not there or something else to indicate it's position
    in the hierarchy.  And in any case, it sounds weird to need to identify Latinotype
    the only distributor of the <em>names</em> of the fonts...  It seems to me like
    a lot of words and phrases got mixed up.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who is interested,
