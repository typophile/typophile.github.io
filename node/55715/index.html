		<div class="commentbody">Ask your librarian if the school has access to the <em>Design and Applied Arts Index</em>, a database that covers many art and design magazines that are not covered in most library databases. The DAAI made my research much easier in school and it is growing at very rapid pace. If your school doesn’t offer it, find a library that does and request (through the head of the design department) that the school get access to this database ASAP. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was just saying it because students these days tend to quickly jump to the internet and only the internet. I'm a student myself, and I use the internet mainly as a means to start a search for information, and after that extend this search into books and magazines (and newspapers). We are actually <em>required</em> to use books, and we usually have to quote parts from the books we use so the teacher verify it if he wants.

Although, of course, the internet can be really good to find information about things that are happening at this very moment.</div>

You will get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1236901498/ref=sr_pg_1?ie=UTF8&rs=1000&keywords=Erik%20Nitsche&rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3AErik%20Nitsche&page=1">a list of books</a> in which he is either mentioned or listed as author/contributor.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you folks. I had no luck with the library at school. Mun has a library on campus and I've heard it has quite a few more books then my school... 
Alrhough, I read that Nitsche really didn't talk about his work, so maybe that has something to do with the lack of information on the net. But the essay is done and done well. 
James, I'm going to check that out first thing in the morning. I would love access to that. Thanks again b'y's. :D</div>
