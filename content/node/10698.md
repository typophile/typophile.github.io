body: I recently produced a PDF of a type design I am working on  from Quark.  <BR>My
  prints are good, the file looks good in Quark and metrics look fine in FOG. <BR>
  <BR>But my kerning and spacing are awful in the PDF. <BR> <BR>What is happening?

  body: Yes, Distiller. <BR> <BR>It is frustrating. I tried using a different printer
    description, recalculating bitmaps, regenerating the type. I can&#39;t figure
    it out.  <BR> <BR>In fact, the pdf is kerning letters on it&#39;s own. Like two
    &#34;T&#34;s next to each other are suddenly touching when the FOG file and everything
    else shows them with plenty of spacing. <BR> <BR>urrr. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR>

  body: Have you tried saving the file as postscript and then plopping that onto distiller?
    Or exporting it out of distiller as an EPS and then re-distilling it? Which version
    of export to PDF are you using? <BR> <BR>So. Just to understand. The PDF &#34;visually&#34;
    looks crap, but the PDF &#34;prints&#34; well?

    I have found at &#34;Page Width&#34; the kerning looks bad but zoom in and you&#39;re
    golden . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    <BR> <BR>No. The Quark file does. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;...try zooming in at different

    means when you generate PDFs using other fonts you have no problem? <BR>

  body: sean, <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve never had this problem, so i&#39;m not sure i can
    help you. i think the first thing you should try now is to generate a .ps file
    and then distill it, as tiffany said before. this can be too much work, but it
    may be worth after all. <BR> <BR>did you try to change font&#39;s embedding settings?
    in pages 3 and 4, your gill sans was replaced by adobe sans here. set acrobat
    to &#34;embed all fonts&#34;. <BR>

  body: Eduardo, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help. I finally started to trouble shoot
    the file really seriously today and found the issue was in one single line of
    text. If I deleted the box the PDF was good.  <BR> <BR>So I just replaced the
    type and what do you know it worked. <BR> <BR>I was wrong. I blame Quark after
    all. <BR> <BR>I am going to try what Tiffany said just for fun. The only reason
    I have not done it yet was that if a client had actually purchased this type I
    would not expect them to have to do this to make a PDF. They should be able to
    just do it. But now that everything seems cool, I&#39;ll give it a try. I will
    still carefully examine the bit of type I deleted. Maybe there was a bad character.
    <BR> <BR> And embed all fonts is a really good idea. <BR> <BR>Thanks again. I
    think this case is closed. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    going to ask you that. in page 2, there are 2 occurencies of pair &#34;nd&#34;:
    one is in the word &#34;standard&#34; you showed us and the other is in the word
    &#34;tandem&#34;. they have different spacings, but now it seems &#34;tandem&#34;
    is right. <BR> <BR>good luck! ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>ps:
