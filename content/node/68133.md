body: "After looking over the Bowfin print website , I stumbled across a font that
  I'm curious about. The name is Limited View.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lv_bpw_4277.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  remember this font from years ago as it was used on both the ColecoVision & NES
  packaging. Does anyone know if it's been digitized and if so , does it still carry
  the same title?\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appeciated. Thanks in advance. "

    to Opti fonts for several years. Castcraft had a dated, dysfunctional website
    with overpriced fonts (when they would even respond) and that website disappeared
    within the last few months.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of another digitization."

  body: "Unfortunately, offhand, I cannot remember where I got that image, except
    that I think it was a scan. I was given a large collection of Opti fonts, but
    I cannot find that one among them. I don't think my collection was complete, so
    that isn't proof it wasn't Opti. I am thinking I scanned it from one of the Dover
    books I have, but I am having trouble finding the right book.\r\n\r\nSome of the
    FontBank (a.k.a. Expresiv Classic), or other \"Expresiv\" brand fonts were the
    same as some of the Opti fonts (none of them were original designs), but I don't
    see this one in those either. \r\n\r\nIf I come across the source, I will post
    to this thread.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found the book I scanned it from: \"Sans Serif Display Alphabets\" by Dan
    X. Solo, Published in 1979 by Dover Books. This means it was probably a film type.
    I don't think I have ever seen a digital version, and it sounds Mike, as if you
    aren't sure about whether Opti had a digital version. Is that right?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thank you both for your reply and research. That's a shame it hasn't been
    digitized , I'd really love to get a hold of that one. \r\n\r\nOn my description
    above , it looks as though I may be off a bit on one of the items. Just for grins
    & giggles of course. Perhaps not too far , as it's easily based off the same design
    , or so it appears. Minus the 'A' and 'R'. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nes_box_4356.jpg]"

    Anyway, it's a very popular Techno look. Close to Armchair Modern from Psy/Ops,
    also.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It doesn't matter now, but just to clarify, Mike, I'm looking at a Castcraft
    catalog of Opti Postscript fonts that includes Opti Limited View.

  body: "So then it's safe to assume , Mike F. , that the <em>Opti Limited View</em>
    font is not available for download online , anywhere?\r\n\r\nI'm still new to
    this , so I'm not quite sure how the catalogs relate to online sites like MyFonts
    or Linotype just yet.\r\n\r\nSo again , I thank you both for your replies , and
    since I'm adding a new question to the mix , thank you for your patience also. "

  body: "As Mike said Castcraft seems to have disappeared from the web. My suggestion
    would be to look closely at Psy/Ops [[http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_armchair.html|Armchair
    Modern]], because it comes in several weights and has 2 or 3 variant of most letters,
    resulting in something very similar to Limited View. This sample is from my Bauhaus
    Guide.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Armchair-Modern_4099.gif]\r\n\r\n- Mike
