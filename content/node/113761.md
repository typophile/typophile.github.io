  Font';\r\n  src: url(ftp://www.mysite.com/forum/fonts/20THBOLD.TTF);\r\n}</code>\r\n\r\nHave
  tried calling it with all different names, but it refuses to show. How do I find
  the name I need to call in CSS. NexusFont tells me the postscriptname is 20thCenturyFontBold,
  but that doesn't work. I've tried many combinations... \r\n\r\nDo I need to add
  something to the header as well to force the remote computer to download it?"

    might not show the font. \r\nAlso, the internal font name is irrelevant. What
    you put after \"font-family:\" is totally up to you. It's just a reference to
    the linked file. "
