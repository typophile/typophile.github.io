  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,

Sensato Serif can be viewed here: http://www.typophile.com/node/78292

This is Sensato. Derived from 'Sensational'. It's purpose is to create a highly legible sans-serif with a diagonal stress and work just as well for display purposes. Although this is not included in the pdf yet, the jpg picture below shows the different grades I designed for optical adaption to different sizes. As soon as the Caps are also done in both grades (the two extremes) the pdf will be updated. All comments are much appreciated. 

Cheers,
Jasper de Waard

update 2.0: 4 Different grades. Only lowercase for now.
update Sensato A: Lower contrast, more organic features, better stem treatment, smaller terminals, new sample text.

Enjoy!

I agree the tittles are slightly (!) too prominent in text, but I wouldn’t change them too much.
The periods look fine to me but there’s something that buggers me about your comma –
maybe its curved shape or the optical period-to-comma ratio.

I think the /g/ as a whole could use slightly more contrast, check the word «recognizable» in your sample text.

About the W/w: To me, it’s rather the thickness/flatness of the apex than the fact that it’s lowered that makes it stick out.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys! Don't be easy on my design, just because it's not so long in development.

@Frode: Yes I have tried a similar tail like the J in the Q, but decided the original Q looked better. It was a bit late when I did so though, so I'll try some other options.
The slightly slanted version doesn't ad that much. True, for the simple reason anybody could slant the font themselves. I'm afraid though, that if I don't do it for them, they'll simply forget about it. If this ever goes to the market, I won't let people pay extra for the slanted version.

@Joerg: Yes, the comma was quite quickly and never revised since. I'll include an improved comma in the next update. Your right about the g. Working on that right now. The W is a tough one, but I'll see what I can do about it.

@Caled: The tail of the y might be a bit thick, but I don't see any problem with the tail in J. I will start working on the black as soon as soon as I'm fully confident with the regular =D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper, this has a great deal of potential but then I suppose Garamond is reliably good model.

>>>The slightly slanted version doesn't add that much, IMO.

I am also not sure if the difference between the two fonts Sensa and Senso is different enough to warrant pursuing two fonts in the end, although it may be an interesting exercise in production. I would decide and concentrate on just one version and get it right - others may disagree.

Here's some feedback on the glyphs themselves:

A lot of talk about period and comma. I would construct a colon and a semicolon and stick all four punctuation marks alongside each other. The point on the top of the comma will help you get the right size for the period and more especially the comma. You probably cannot design the comma and period in isolation from the semicolon and colon. I like the size of the tittle on the i and j. I'm not sure if those who say it should be different distance from the top of the stem of i and j aren't a little deluded. 

The comma is normally cut at the top from 8 o'clock to 2 o'clock. This reflects the angle of the pen, though you might want to contradict the pen convention, although from the look of the /O/ for example, I would doubt it.

General comment: I think the diagonal arms taper outwards a little too much on /A/, /K/, /R/, /V/, /W/, /X/, /Y/ and this also applies to many of the lower case counterparts.

Upper case:

/A/ looks shorter than the rest, maybe because it's next to /B/ which overshoots too much in my world.
/B/ a bit too bouncy, curved on top and bottom?
/D/ looks taller top and bottom than /C/
/E/, /F/ lovely, though some may want /F/ crossbar even lower still.
/G/ I would be thickening the right hand vertical a little and maybe even a touch taller, could it be misread at speed as a /C/?
/L/ needs to be narrower than bottom of /E/. It may already be narrower but still looks wide. You're trying to avoid a massive white gap in words like 'Liverpool' which kerning will not address.
/M/ is quite wide but you may not have a lot of choice if apex is coming right down to baseline.
/N/ may need a thicker diagonal, especially telling next to /O/.
/Q/ I would make the angle of the angle of cut across the tail more horizontal, certainly the horizontal side of 45 degrees.
/R/ leg looks a little light.
/S/ top looks heavier than bottom.
/T/ and /U/ marginally narrow? /T/ crossbar too heavy (also applies to crossbars of /Z/).
/X/ slightly light.
/Z/ too tall, I realise this applies to /T/ too.

The tops of those caps look a little bit like a roller coaster. Part of achieving more evenness may be to flatten some of the /B/, /D/, /P/ and /R/ tops and bottoms.

Lower case:

/a/ bowl goes down too low compared with the tail. 
/d/ looks wide next to /e/.
/g/ tail is pointy on right.
/i/ and /j/ need to share the same x-height?
/p/ would make a nice /d/ if you rotated it. The stem is a little too narrow (applies also to /b/ and /q/).
/s/ looks bottom-heavy (reverse of /S/).
/z/ crossbars too thick.

Hope this helps, the length of feedback is proportional to the promise of the typeface. I would forget about Expletus and throw yourself into this! It's reading very nicely and that is a good starting place, you can keep refining glyph shapes later, it's much harder to get it to read well.

Merry Christmas,
Nick.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Wow! I don't know if it's just me, but I read your whole comment with the voice of a wiseman in my mind. I believe such a long comment deserves an (almost) equally long answer, so I'll do my best to be as clear as possible. Some of the things you say, I have already noticed. Some of the things I haven't, and some I disagree to. 

I must admit that, although slanting it a little still adds a value to the look IMO, there is no need to include this in the typeface. Anybody could do this in most applications themselves after all, without having to use a seperate font. So Senso no longer is. Just Sensa and perhaps, later, Sensa Serif.

The tittles look fine to you, because I have already changed them. What you have been looking at was an update with changed tittles. The fact that it looks right to you probably shows that I scaled them down to the right size. =D At a second look they appear to flat, so I'll make them a little more round.

I have already redesigned the comma and other punctuation which I will include in my next update (perhaps tomorow already). I made the angle on the top of the a a bit more flat than you suggested. Those are some helpful tips you got there!

Uppercase:

The diagonal arms taper out more than is usual, but IMO this is the only way of making them look like they belong with the other strokes in the typeface. I will try to prove myself wrong by changing a few diagonals, but I doubt it.

I can't say anything sensible about your opinion on the individual glyphs, before having tried some changes. Unlike you might think, my minds capability to picture shapes is not so good, but I don't believe this has much influence on my designs.

The top of the caps from Myriad Pro (In my opinion the best designed/best balanced typeface I know of) also look a bit like a roller coaster (I wouldn't call it that way, but I get the idea) and it doesn't bother me, Nor does it bother me in Sensa. However, I will try to see if it looks better with more flat tops and bottoms.

Lowercase:

Same thing as with the caps. I can't say anything sensible about most of the things you say. Just some remarks: the d is a turned around p (the reverse actually), so it probably shouldn't be. i and j share the same x height (optical illusion perhaps. I'm unable to see it though.)

At display size, many stems look to thin indeed, but (perhaps it's technical problem) at text size they appear fine. They used to appear too thick at text size (also on high quality prints) so I changed them. <strong>Do they appear to thin also at text size to any of you guys?</strong> If not I have already failed one of my goals, which was to create a typeface equally useful for text and display use. I might have to make different optical weights now, which improves excellence, but is not so practical. <strong>Any opinions?</strong>

Thanks for a long, helpful and positive comment! This is of great help. Expletus will soon be released and I still have to do the Italics, so I can't intirely forget about it, but I won't make a pro version like I intended to do earlier.

One thing I don't understand. "you can keep refining glyph shapes later, it's much harder to get it to read well." Shouldn't I refine glyphs in order to make it read better?

A very happy Christmas to everyone and thanks again,

Jasper

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper, I love the fact that you are prepared to stand by your guns on some of this stuff; good for you! Your gut instincts may serve you well.

However I would consider that some of the curviness of Myriad (top and bottom of some caps) was merely to move it away from Frutiger and serves no useful purpose except to give it a softer appearance.

I had a look at Nota and think you've got your work cut out. That is fine work indeed fine work as you commented in your previous thread 'Garamond Sans'. 

I think that some of the tricks that typographers use to give optical correction are massively overplayed (e.g. amount of overshoot on curved forms, the flaring of slanted arms, the tipping forward of the top of a /t/ etc.) But the point is that you shouldn't be noticing these effects, they are there to make stuff look right, otherwise the effect has failed. If you can pull off an optical correction without it being noticed, that is success.

Now, I'm looking again at the /i/ and /j/ and the x-height is markedly different on the pdf. What's going on with that? Brilliant on the rotated /p/ and /d/! :) However the /p/ and the /d/ are definitely not the same on the pdf that I'm looking at. I would love to be able to do a capture of what I'm seeing but I'm not on my normal machine.

>>>One thing I don't understand. "you can keep refining glyph shapes later, it's much harder to get it to read well." Shouldn't I refine glyphs in order to make it read better?

Yes and no. Now you've got it to read so well, it doesn't need major work, merely cosmetic refinements to make the individual glyphs look nicer...however, there is no use in getting beautiful individual glyphs which just don't work together or are poorly spaced but you're a million miles from that here and that is very commendable.

I wouldn't busy yourself with optical weights yet, it will make your head hurt and you should be enjoying life, not living with a headache. Not unless you think this is the font which you're going to be remembered for. Think about a pro font having 1,000+ glyphs and how much work that is already going to involve.

Wonder what Mr Shinn makes of your new name Sensa/Senso in view of his recent releases :)?

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, While working on your comments I noticed that some of the things you noticed are simply the result of bad rendering. If you print the pdf, some of the problems you stated will probably disappear. Z and T also looked to high on my screen at 135%, but when I made it 100% they aligned nicely, just like in the printed version. This doesn't mean everything you stated is useless. In fact I have already made quite a lot welcome changes, but it explains some weird things you noticed. Maybe when you print it you will also notice that the p really is a turned around d ;-d 
I'll get back to typophile today with a new update including all the changes I made after reading your comments.

		<div class="commentbody">Sensa was the right one to ditch because it makes more sense to slant a straight font in an application (e.g. inDesign) than to straighten a slanted font. The name Sensa comes from 'sensational' and has nothing to do with Sense and Sensibility if that's what you meant. Your probably right about the optical weights, so I'll just have to find some sort of compromise between display and text, I guess. I'll start a new topic on this in the 'Design' section. See if anybody else experienced the same problem.

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper, Sorry but I wonder now if I preferred the slightly curved /B/,/D/, etc. I just think it was too curved in the earlier versions.

However, still looking good in text even having made changes.

I definitely preferred the flatter periods. The heavier you get the flatter they will need to be. I also much prefer the new comma. Questionmark /?/ looks a little Hebraic and doesn't fit with rest of typeface to my mind.

/f/ and /t/ verticals look thin.

/t/ angle at the top troubles me. I probably want it to be horizontal but I can't say why.

/C/ and /c/ may need more advance width on right (set 'chin/chick' next to 'thin/thick') (/B/ may need less advance width.)

/W/ looks a little thick at central apex, the two middle strokes may need to be a little less tapered.
/Y/ Vertical stem lookslight compared with left arm. It's a vertical so shouldn't it logically be optically as thick as /T/ stem.
/Z/I find it interesting that you have given /Z/ and ink-trap but have not given /W/ when the angle in the /W/ is even tighter. Same applies to /M/ vs /N/ (if /N/ ink-trapped, why not /M/?)
(I like the shape of the ink-trap though and I am definitely not saying don't have ink-traps.)

If you're saying /T/ and /Z/ have same height as /U/ then this is rendering appallingly which makes feedback on shapes potentially pointless. Are you applying any hinting? Might be worth switching off before providing a new pdf...

Lastly, if you're going to genuinely test readability, you're going to need to set some words in a language that some people actually still speak ;)

I would also be inclined to leave old versions up there for comparison.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow Nick. You reall keep going on this one :-)

On the B, D tec it's probably gonna be the golden midway. Same for the tittles (I guess you meant tittles when you said periods? the period remains unchanged.)
Many changes are made to give it a more even colour in text, so in fact it should look better in text. The question mark is not usual no, but like it's shape. It's comparable to Calluna's question mark. I think the Haebraic thing will get less if I make the top a little thinner.

f and t verticals are thin, bit yet again, they look fine to me. What I really need is a good laser printer. To judge a typeface at text size, inkjet just won't work. I have already asked a printer whom I have good relationship with if he has a not-too-expensive solution. 

Your definitely right about the top of t, I'll change that.

With 'advance width' I assume you mean spacing. All the spacing so far is inDesign's optical function. Works quite well doesn't it?

Yes. I had the same thought about W, but somehow didn't get to it yet. Your right on spot with Y too.

The lack of inktraps on some spots is just sloppyness. I'll include inktraps everywhere they're needed in next update.

I'm not applying any hinting. I'll apply autohinting in next update. That might solve the problem. But the thing is: a screen is made out of pixels.

I remove old versions becasue I have seen people commenting regarding old pdf files in other topics in the critique section. Furthermore: When I've made a change and it looks right to me, I might choose something between the original and new version in the end, but I don't want to get stuck in older versions. If something looks 'wrong', I should be able to see this without knowing hwo it used to look.

Thanks again for some great feedback!

Pixels or not, I cannot understand why, if the points at the top of the T and Z are at the same height as U, V, H etc, they are rendering so far north of where they should be, at all viewing sizes. I'll post something in the next couple of days.

On /t/ and /f/ stems are noticeably thinner than the others to me. Again, I would say if the adjustment is obvious/apparent, you've probably overcooked it.

Look forward to next posting. Keep going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This update includes PS hinting Nick. If your working on OSX the alignment and thickness problems should be solved. I checked it on my Mac and everything aligns nicely now. That is, on my screen. It's still best to print it, but I understand this might get a bit expensive. t and f are still mathematically thinner than the rest, but perhaps they used to look thinner than they are on your screen and will look fine now due to the hinting. 

I made some testprints from a copyshop today. The quality still wasn't what I'm really looking for, but better than my inkjet. These prints showed that the f and t looked thicker than the rest so I made them a tad thinner (1 unit) compared to last time. I've found a copyshop with a printer that's probaly good enough for my needs, but they haven't responded to my email yet. I think I'll start working on the numerals and leave the stems for what they are untill I have some real quality testprints.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jasper, this version is looking very nice indeed. I'm still on Windows XP but looks fine.

I'd prefer the tittles to be rounder, I guess what you're going for should be a smaller version of the period for consistency? As far as the positioning of the tittles over the /i/ and /j/ is concerned, won't your Dutch /ij/ look weird if the tittles are at noticeably different heights? I've had a look at a whole lot of sans serifs (e.g. Gill, Stone) to see what they do and they all seem to put the tittle at exactly the same heights for both /i/ and /j/. I wonder if the change of height thing in Garamond is to do with counterbalancing serifs?

After everything else I said, I wonder if the /B/, /D/, /P/ and /R/ could withstand a touch more curvature top AND bottom. I think the angle at the bottom of inner stroke on bowls of /B/ and /D/ either needs softening or you curve them in as per original. I'm sorry, I feel like I sent you on a wild goose chase with the flat stroke approach.

/C/ looks like it is tipping backwards, less so on /c/ but still a bit notceable to me in text. Same could be said for /G/, although that's a fine letter you've drawn.

/E/ angle of terminal on middle bar looks different from top and bottom to me, same with /F/?

/K/ angle too far away from stem. Since width of the whole character looks good, maybe make the arms less inclined so apex is nearer the stem? Apex could also go down a bit so the optical centre is closer to crossbar of /H/, same for /k/ but you may disagree.

/L/ you may even get away with a touch more off the foot.

/M/ is very nice indeed, you're looking for similar central strokes in /W/ (i.e. less tapered still). /M/ could maybe go a fraction narrower, as could /W/ maybe?

/R/ still light on leg/foot and at the junction. Look at same stroke in /X/ - much thicker.

/T/ optical thing - does the whole crossbar need to move slightly to the right? (BTW, /T/ and /Z/ horizontals looking much better and correct height too!

/quotesingle/ and /quotedbl/ really like the angel you have cut those off at, can it be the same for /comma/ and all quotes?

/t/ could withstand slight leaning to right at top. You could also extend the arm out a little further. Or else, for consistency, you could make it more like the /f/ and cut it at an angle higher up as shown below:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jasper2_4081.png]

/y/ I preferred a gentler curve on the tail as per earlier versions? Looks like it's got a kink in it to me.

/b/, /d/, /p/ and /q/ There is still some inconsistency with the widths of these. In previous posts you've said the /p/ and /d/ are the same glyph but rotated. I assume you would do the same thing with /b/ and /q/. Have a look at the capture below:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jasper_3534.png]

My feeling is that the /d/ and /q/ are a good deal wider than they need to be (even if you are following the Garamond model). Those red rectangles are all identical. To my mind, the /b/ and /p/ are the right width but the /d/ and /q/ are just too wide. Remember, I'm sure you do, the white counters play just as imporant a role as the black strokes. You don't want big white holes which I think you are getting a little with /d/ in text.

Well done on the ink-traps! 

Keep going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nick. The tittles look quite round to me and the tittle on i and j really are on the same height, I'm afraid. Seems like hinting doesn't fix everything. Although I want to avoid getting into the technical things to early, It's good to know how much Windows xp influences the way the type looks. Could you show me some more screenshots of what it looks like on your pc, also on smaller sizes? That would be really helpful.

Some other weird things you noticed must be the effect of the poor rendering on Windows xp. The b and d are actually the same width, so it seems like the poor rendering still occurs at larger sizes (Are you working with Adobe Reader? If not, maybe you should try it). If your working on xp, you actually need Truetype hinted fonts, which I won't make during the design process. The t does lean to the right a little on the top, which is visible on my screen, but I think Windows Xp sticks to the hinting, which makes it appear straight. I like the t as it is, so I'll stick to it.

Your definitely right about the C c G E F W R T y and the quotes.

The q is different from the b for a reason. The same thing can be seen in Nick Shinn's 'Sense'. The q has to be flatter at the top because otherwise the u will look as if it's too high in words like quality. The q is very often followed by a u so that's quite an important pair. If you look at Plantin for example, you'll see they added a small piece to the q to make it work when followed by u. In some typefaces they use the q (with a 'flat' top) to make the b. I've tried this with Sensa, but it just doesn't look right that way.

Although your comments are still very welcome and useful I don't see why you don't make a print of the pdf. I understand it would be a waste of paper and ink to do this with every new update, but it should help you see how your screen influences what you see. I have just finished a version with slightly thicker stems, so if you plan on making a print perhaps you should wait for the next update.

I've had a look at your website and although I'm not so much of a logo expert at least the typography in all of them looks really nice. Especially Matterhorn Capital, which looks like a custom job, right. You obviously have an eye for typedesign but I can't find any fonts of you on the internet. Why not?

A cheeky question, just out of curiousity. Do you think Sensa has the potential of being accepted by one of the better foundries? (e.g. FontFont, Font Bureau, Monotype, etc.)

Thanks again for some great feedback Nick!</div>

>>>...I can't find any fonts of you on the internet. Why not?

Because type design appears to take a lot longer than I thought it would. Not long now though, I hope.

Viability depends on a range of weights, plus italics. When you've got the regular sorted out, it'll be time to start on the bold. When you've got the bold sorted out, it'll be time to make a multiple master and extrapolate to light and heavy. Once you've engineered the light and heavy, you'll need to make another multiple master to revisit the regular and bold, to make sure you're still happy. (So the regular you are currently slaving over is unlikely to be the one you end up going with in the end! Frustrating, huh?) When you have got a multiple master with a weight axis that you're happy with, that's probably the time to start thinking about different optical sizes, if that's still on your radar. (I haven't even mentioned the italics yet!)

Now some designers use more than one multiple master to establish all their weights, since at the heavy end, you may have to make serious adjustments for it still to work, depending on the design itself.

I guess, above all, what a foundry is looking for more than anything is a robust concept because they want great-looking typefaces that are going to make some cash. So if you're asking whether a foundry would be interested, keep going!!</div>

Extrapolating doesn't always work the way it should, so I think I'll make a black and light and interpolate to make the other weights. If done properly, there shouldn't be a need for editing the generated weights by hand this way. This is a different topic though. I first want to make sure I got all the uc and lc in the regular right, before I start thinking about other weights.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>>>Extrapolating doesn't always work the way it should

You're absolutely right, it doesn't, but if you start with your regular and bold (the most used weights, I'm guessing), you'll have to extrapolate to get a rough light and heavy.

Assuming you're making 5 weights, you are currently working on Wt2 (regular), and soon to be working on Wt4 (bold). You're going to have to extrapolate to get at least basis for Wt1 (light) and Wt5 (Heavy). I'm not pretending Wt1 and Wt5 are going to look right from extrapolating but how else are you going to establish Wt1 and Wt5? Once you have got Wt1 and Wt5 looking right, then you need to work out if your Wt2 and Wt4 (and of course Wt3 (medium, if you're having medium, that is) also look right (and are faithful to the original concept).

I'm now working on my second viable font and this time I haven't started with a regular but a hairline and an extrablack. Some may call me naive but I quite like the way it's going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"I'm now working on my second viable font and this time I haven't started with a regular but a hairline and an extrablack. Some may call me naive but I quite like the way it's going." That's exactly what I plan to do, only I also make the regular in between to get a better idea of what it's supposed to look like. Hairline and extrablack is much harder to balance out IMO than a regular, so if I started out with only hairline and extrablack, the regular probably wouldn't turn out the way I want it to. Your simply a more advanced typedesignerthan , so for you only Hairline and ExtraBlack seems like a logical solution. Why don't you post your work on typophile?

What, and bare my soul to the entire world? I think you're very brave!

I did once post something, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/37598">Energy</a> back in the day. That's the face I've gone back to now, albeit it look a whole lot different now (seven weights versus original eight) plus it has morphed through several changes. I didn't get much feedback so didn't want to flog a dead horse, even though it's looking a whole lot nicer these days. I might post something soon, who knows...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It never ceases to amaze me how many times I've looked through the critique section and stumbled across something that looks very much like something I'm right in the middle of doing, which invariably has me saying "@$@%^ it!" to myself. While my current project differs slightly in a handful of ways from this work (i.e., the slightly curved lines to the immediate left of the shoulders in the m, n, r and p; also above the crossbar of the lowercase 't'), it's still way too close for me to feel enough difference. It's definitely a beautiful typeface, though, and one of which you should be proud.

Just one question, though, keeping in mind I haven't read all the entries on the above thread: If you are not going to enclose what I guess would be called the "bowls" in the P, 6, and 9, is there something preventing you from adopting the same concept to the R and the B? Obviously you could turn them both upside-down and make them sing "Unforgettable" if you wanted to; I'm simply wondering what the philosophy there was, if any at all.

Nicely done.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bold looks like a good starting place. Wonder of it's a bit too heavy but the acid test is putting some bold in amongst some regular in a block of copy and see if it's black enough.

By my reckoning, sans bolds generally tend to be between 1.4 and 1.8 times thicker and I would guess that your stem widths are down the 1.8 end. I would also suggest that Myriad's Bold is very dark (maybe too dark) but then Myriad Regular is by no means slim!

In Italian, “sensato” has the same meaning as in Portuguese and Spanish. It’s an adjective which could be applied either to people or to ideas or actions.</div>

To me type design (as well as graphic design btw) could use some more «pride of origin» nowadays. After all, that’s a great USP for your typeface.
And I think there are far too few typefaces with Dutch names out there, measured against the vast amount of talented Dutch type designers!</div>

I'm surprised to know that. In South America your country has a very reputable image. Nederland is known as an organized, liberal and highly developed country, with an outstanding living quality and education. Your long tradition in graphic design is also widely referred – a Dutch landmark besides tulipes, bicycles, art and the dikes. Not to mention WIC and the magic '74 soccer team.

For many Brazilians, the Dutch defeat in Pernambuco, in 1654, was a pitty. They claim that to be a Dutch colony would have resulted in a much better Brazil. Although this is just a historic speculation, there is no doubt Nassau's administration was a golden age in colonial Pernambuco, with many valuable heritge. BTW, the first type tools in South America were brought by the Dutchmen circa 1637.

Well, after this off-topic comment, let me add there is a number of recent releases named with words from the designer mother tongue (Tisa, Alegria and Despeinada are samples). So, except if you adopt something dificult like verantwoordelijk, a Dutch name would work. Anyway, Sensato is also good. Due to its Latin origin, it's easily recognizable as something related to sense in many languages.</div>

The Brazilian link Freiberger mentions is one example of the extensive influence of the Low Countries during the period that was our ‘Golden Age’, a period when the Dutch ruled the world of commerce, applied science, seafaring and warfaring (Prince Maurits reintroduced classic concepts of drilling and coordinated movements on the battlefield). 

And on a somewhat more type-related stance: in the same period the Dutch were the publishers of the free-thinking world: a place where the most advanced thinkers of that time could evade the all-pervading censorship in countries like France, Great-Britain etcetera by having their works published in Leiden, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Utrecht. 

Required reading matter: Simon Schama's ‘The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age’ (1987) and Jonathan Israel’s ‘The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall, 1477-1806’ (1995).</div>

Have you tried adding a descending serif to the top of the lowercase 'a' in the serif version of your font? I'd also be interested to see what it looks like with serifs on the 's' and the 'c'. Perhaps it's just my screen but it also looks like the legs of the 'n' and the 'm' grow thicker as they descend to the serifs (as opposed to the 'n' and the 'm' in the sans version, which appear to have the same width all the way through). But as I say, maybe it's my screen.

In regard to naming, I'm quite a fan of the idea of naming fonts after towns that have had a particular impact on me or the font. Somehow I don't think it looks like a 'Rotterdam', but maybe there's another town that has had an impact on you personally? Even though those who don't know Dutch may struggle (toss a 'G' or an 'IJ' in there for good measure, or perhaps a double-vowel), it may form part of the charm!</div>

Thanks Caled. I have already made quite a few changes including serifs on a and s (c terminal is still the same). You're right about the legs, they do grow thicker as they go downward, but I don't see the porblem with this. The serifs are, again, loosely based on Garamond.

I will upload Sensato Serif in the serif critique section today or tomorrow.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, Jasper. Don't over-engineer this. I'm not a fan of the micro-curves (corner softening) that you have introduced into the lower case. I think your shapes may have peaked already before the addition of these tiny curves. You may feel the characters are not interesting enough without this softening but I feel you may have gone a bit gimmicky for no good reason. If, on the other hand, you are resorting to micro detailing to give differentiation from other fonts, your basic concept may be at fault. However, I happen to believe the concept is strong, as you know. I'd love to see some more characters; diacritics, lining numerals, that kind of thing. Cheers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you say higher contrast, have you thinned the horizontals? The whole thing is a little bit lighter all over, right? If you build a multiple master you won't have to redraw everything, you'll just have to select an 'instance' that suits you relative to the serif version. Question, do you want the same blackness to each corresponding weight in sans and serif?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is a bit lighter al over, yes, I thinned all verticals. I know it's not the most efficient way, but I prefer to redraw everything, because I always catch a few issues on the way. I do want the weights to have the same blackness. However, I won't be able to go as far with the serif as I can with the Sans. So the darkest in the Serif will propably be extrabold, while the sans goes up to Black.

I uploaded an update above, without the soft edges, with adjusted Caps (contrast same as lowercase now). The B is completely redrawn.

Furthermore I just updated the serif. I also removed the soft edges there, making it a more centro/calluna like font. I think it's a huge improvement, hop you agree! Still no caps there though.

I'm also working on the Black Caps, so expect an update (serif or sans black) soon. Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As far as contrast is concerned, I like the numerals, esp. /zero/ for contrast (you may not have changed that! I think you've gone too thin on the horizontals so it now looks to me more like a serif with the serifs removed and less like a sans.

I'm not a massive fan of the thinning stems on the /d/, /m/, /n/, /p/, /r/, /u/. Not sure you've nailed that yet.

Upper terminal on /c/ too thick, lower terminal too thin. This will impact /a/, /e/, /f/, /s/. I wonder if final strokes on /c/ and /e/ need to be slightly more open.

I think Craig's right about that /g/. Should the ear be more tapered (outwards) to echo the /c/? It could even take more of a lead from the arm of the /r/. The bottom bowl of the /g/ looks very pointy at the easternmost extremum.

/v/ still looks a smidge too wide next to /u/.

I still cannot get used to the tapered letters /k/, /v/, /w/. Did I mention that?

There are a number of spacing issues but that warrants a separate post They were less obvious when Sensato was looser.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The contrast is an important factor for the look of a typeface. After a couple of years I came to the conlusion that my style is somewhat stiff, arrogant, yet elegant. Like a bitchy model. Contrast is mostly just a matter of taste, and I like it the way it is now. It looks more elegant and better for display use now. However, do not fear, the old contrast is too good to throw away, so I think I'll just make a different typeface out of it in the future. You're right that I didn't change the contrast in /zero/.

"I'm not a massive fan of the thinning stems on the /d/, /m/, /n/, /p/, /r/, /u/. Not sure you've nailed that yet."
Yes, that certainly deserves a revision. Since I started on the serif it bothered me.

You're probably also right about the terminals.

Have you seen the pict of the g above. Does that look any better?

Yes, now that you say so, v is too wide indeed.

I'll try to 'detaper' the tapered letters.

The spacing is all inDesign's optical function, which isn't perfect.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jasper, part of the charm of the original Sensato was the pointiness. The chamfered terminals seem to work against that. I just think the terminals were a little bulky. I don't think the cuts you have made are working. Worth trying though.

Thought I'd get a bit more detailed on feedback again, hope you don't mind.

/a/ wonder if the overhang top left is too much. Lower junction with stem is light next to upper junction of /b/.

/b/ lower junction of /b/ is very black. Upper junction is good.

/c/ if you take the upper extremum of the inside curve out towards the next point up from the one it currently goes to the inside curve will be a whole lot nicer even if the terminal is a lot lighter.

/d/ see /b/ for blackness at junction. I think making the angle on the stems more vertical and the angle of the base of the stem more horizontal may help (and give it slightly more thickness which I think it may need.

/e/ leans forward whereas /c/ leans back a little. I may be imagining that!

/f/ love the angles involved in the crossbar.

/g/ ear much improved, agreed Craig? Could still go a touck deeper.

/h/ was always strong.

/i/ tittle very slightly heavy.

/j/ see /i/ for tittle comment. Would the tail coming less far to the left help with a slightly gentler curve?

/k/ overflaring.

/m/ see /d/ stem comment applies.

/n/ strong like /h/ but /d/ stem comment applies. 

/o/ good.

/p/ see /d/. /q/ see /b/

/r/ see /d/ re stems. Ear/arm beautiful.

/s/ see /c/ for comment about terminals (and initial paragraph of this post).

/t/ top leans forward a touch too much.

/u/ see /n/

/v/ width better now. very slight overflaring (I know you want some flare).

/w/ strokes 1 and 3 could be darker/thicker.

/x/ and /y/ good.

/z/ top horizontal touch thin (maybe bottom horizontal too thin too). You want optically equal, right?

/A/ overflaring (am I boring you?)

/B/ interesting curves. Bottom left corner too thick on horizontal stroke. Looks heavier to me than /A/

/C/ see /c/

/D/ see /B/ for bottom left comment.

/E/ arms thin (like /z/) especially compared to horizontals of /B/ and /D/. I thin the problem is the /D/ and /B/, not the /E/.

/F/ see /E/ on arms. Lower arm could stand going south a touch.

/G/ would make the final upward stroke cut off horizontally rather than angular which doesn't appear elsewhere in the upper case.

/H/, /I/ fine.

/J/ see /j/ re sweep of the curve.

/K/ see /k/

/L/ fine.

/M/ great, any reason why the central apex doesn't quite reach the floor (that comment may apply to the /w/ and /W/ too.

/N/ right foot causing me trouble (as /G/)

/O/ fine.

/P/ not quite getting it but can't put my finger on it.

/Q/ fine.

/R/ does the central portion need to echo /B/ more or vice versa?

/S/ see /s/

/T/ good.

/U/ could be a touch wider?

/V/ see /v/

/W/ see /w/ but only on stroke 3.

/X/ and /Y/ fine.

/Z/ leaning backwards compared to /z/.

Cheers!</div>

Nick's eye is excellent so take his generous advice to heart!

To me, the glyph in need of most work now is definitely /B/. Look at some other /B/s and maybe consider a fresh start. And after that some other curved caps: /D/G/R/. And I guess /S/ falls rightward and /C/ may be too thick at its thickest, so maybe its "all curved caps"!

As for the chamfering, it adds a bit of refinement at display sizes but doesn't help -- maybe in fact hurts -- at text sizes, I think.</div>

Now who's being generous? There's a thread about myopia somewhere where I confess how blind I actually am! I think it was to do with which of one's eyes is dominant (which may or may not affect one's ability to design balanced glyphs). Remember that one? Have considered laser treatment for short-sightedness but not an option currently! I just realised that my right eye is dominant but more myopic, am I normal? I digress.

Keep going, Jasper. Accents? 

InD doesn't do a bad auto-job on spacing but I'm confident you could do a better one!

Yes, that especially but also the thickening at the southwest corner. I feel like the outer contour of the letter makes sense but the counterspaces are unhappy.

The pdf remains unchanged, but have a look at the jpg pict to see what I've been doing all this time ;-P. As soon as I also have the caps sorted out I'll update the pdf. After that I'm moving on to the Black, extend the character set in all styles, and work on Sensato Serif now and then on the way. A very fun schedule as you can see! Hope you enjoy the update and any critique is, as always, much appreciated. Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your four grades are looking nice.

I would be wary of marketing them as different grades when the time comes. The top one (I'm guessing the grade for very small sizes) works equally well at large sizes. The last thing you want to do is limit sales by putting an unhelpful cue that the top one should only be used at small sizes, which for me is nonsense as it's the nicest one in my book.

Not sure if you need four grades or whether three or even two are enough (as in simply text v display).

Still don't understand your terminal (a,c,f,r,s) or stem (d,m,n,p,r) treatment!

Are you aware of the National Trust font family? That has display variants. <a href="http://brandcentre.nationaltrust.org.uk/login/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=/Default.aspx">This website</a> has a registration especially for students/journalists.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nick. I'm working on a grade with even lower contrast. I plan to just call the Sensato A, Sensato B, Sensato C, etc. I totally agree that it would be wrong to call them grades or optical sizes, but for now grades will do.

The difference between the four grades is indeed quite small. I'll have to review this after I've finished the new grade.

In the first grade the terminals on a c f r s do look slightly to large to me now, be the high contrast one really needs big terminals. The small chamfered part in the terminals has to stay. When I compare it with/without that part the choice is quite obvious to me. Might be a personal thing, but it's just the way it is.

Does the stem treatment in d m n p r look far off to you? I think I'll try to just keep it straight, comparable to Nota.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How do you like this? Looks like an improvement to me. The contrast in the terminals on c and a is smaller and the stem treatment in n is totally redesigned. Offcoarse this has to be continued in similar glyphs, but it should give you some idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, these stems are an improvement to my mind. What I think I didn't much like was the fact that the outside contour curved whereas the inside contour was dead straight with a noticeable kink due to the ink trap. This is certainly better but it has to work for you.
The junction becomes a challenge in heavier weights and some thinning of the stems may help the colour around the junction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow! I must say that after I changed the stem treatment and the terminals as you suggested it looks WAY better. I don't know why I failed to see you were right all along, but anyway, I've seen the light! Above is a pdf of Sensato A, the lowest contrast version of Sensato. Hope you like it as much as I do. Cheers! BTW: I'm currently in a holiday period, so you can expect some more updates soon as I'll have much more time to work on Sensato. Just wanted to say that all you typophiles in this thread, and specially you Nick, did a great job in showing me my mistakes. This typeface would have never been where it is now without you guys. Once again, thanks A LOT.

Expletus Sans will finally be released in the Google Web Font Directory in 1-2 weeks from now, so keep an eye on the release section on typophile!
