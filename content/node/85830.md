  that was evidently submitted in some kind of design competition.\r\n..\r\nI liked
  it very much and wanted to show it to my Chinese teacher,  but evidently, I didn't
  bookmark as I should have (I swear I did,).  If you could please point me in the
  right direction, I would be very appreciative"
