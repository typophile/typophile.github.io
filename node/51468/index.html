I've been asked to give a price for freelance work in New York for ad-agencies. In Copenhagen I get about 100$ an hour but I've heard 85$ in New York. Do anyone have experience with this?

Thanks guys

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a fresh out of college designer. I landed my first job working at a new magazine in NYC. I accepted a full time position as a designer for $15/hr. I later realized there are absolutely no benefits included, and I'm paid on an hourly wage rather than a 40 hr work week because we are not needed to work everyday. There is a slew of other freelance designers that come every few days. One designer with nearly a decade of experience was being paid $25/hr while another with only a couple years more experience than me is being paid $30/hr. After realizing my position is financially no different than those of the freelance designers I requested being changed to a freelance position. However they agreed and want to continue paying me $15/hr for the work. 

Editorial design understandably does pay less than that of ad agencies. However, I think $15/hr even for a start out designer is ridiculously low in this market, especially in NYC. Any advice? </div>

IF that was a full-time job with benefits, $15/hr would total a little over $30,000 a year (plus benefits), which might be okay for a starting job, although it would be tough to live on that in NYC.

But for a part-time job without benefits, that seems extremely low. 

It's better than nothing, and at least you're getting some experience, but I'd look for something better.

Keep in mind that there is a glut of designers in New York. That keeps down prices, especially in this bad economy. There are too many design schools graduating too many students and too many of them have wealthy parents who can support them after college. And too many of those design students graduate without the high-tech skills they need to get a job because they spent their time in school focusing on conceptual fundamentals instead of keeping up-to-date with web trends. So some entry-level design jobs here can pay under $30,000 with <em>no</em> benefits. And low-end freelance work sometimes goes for $15/hour or less if the client is a small publisher or fashion house with its own budget problems. </div>
