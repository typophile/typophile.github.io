  body: "Historical texts may still refer to florins. It is still usefull in text.
    For instance: \"When I was a child, a pack of gum cost just 2 florins. Now I see
    the same candy for 75 cents!\"\r\n\r\nThere are lots of reasons to need to print
    the florin symbol. It has just has fallen out of contemporary use\u2026\r\n\r\nIn
    Germany, when someone wants to imply how expensive something is, they say houw
    much it would have cost in Deutsche Marks (2 DM = 1 Euro), i.e., \"You can afford
    that car! It cost 70,000 Marks!\"\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    Pretty major: it's part of ASCII-8.\r\n2) Pretty minor: Some people -especially
    on Mac- use it to mean \"folder\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    get to the node/thread - so it does exist. I was using firefox. You might need
    a different browser. \r\n\r\nBut the question of how best to space the florin
    hasn't been adressed here or in the other thread. I guess you could just use your
    own judgement, but it being historical & all it would be ideal to know what the
    convention might be.\r\n\r\nHoefler? Any sage words?\r\n\r\nUnrelated - Hrant,
    what does the middle h stand for?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, if your font has [an option for] monowidth numerals, the Florin should
    have that width too, which sort of nicely constrains you. Then it's a matter of
    taking into account which side of a numeral it might abut against, with the other
    side being almost certainly a blank. But a quick search on Google* for \"\u019250\",
    \"\u0192 50\", \"50\u0192\" and \"50 \u0192\" seems to show that although the
    prefix position is more common -and as far as I know the standard- the suffix
    position cannot be ignored, because we're here to make settings look good and
    work well, not to try to dictate usage of language; this is by looking at the
    number of hits for each.** So I'd say you have to mind both sides (but really
    with numerals only). Think kerning.\r\n\r\n* Which also reveals some interesting
    indepedent uses of the Florin!\r\n\r\n** I actually use Google for spellchecking.\r\n\r\nMy
    middle initial stands for Hratch, my father. And my son's name is Hrad.\r\nThe
    root \"hoor\" means \"fire\" in Armenian. But they're nothing like me.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    colony Surinam switched from the Surinam Guilder to the Surinam Dollar.\r\nThe
    Dutch Antilles use the Netherlands Antillian Guilder (ANG). That's still called
    a florin according to\r\nhttp://www.xe.com/iso4217.htm\r\nwhere you may also note
    that no other currency nowadays uses florin as a denomination. (Though they could
    use the symbol...)."
