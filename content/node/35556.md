  some might be interested in my haul\r\n\r\nalso got to see some of gill's hand carved

  body: "well i'm no expert but i understand that the press is well established, formed
    in 1924 for by Sebastian's father Will Carter it is apparently \"Apart from the
    Officina Bodoni in Italy the longest-established family fine press in the world\"
    I beleive that among other things sebastian most famously oversaw the digitization
    of Golden Cockerel and authored 20th century type designers:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/20th-Century-Designers-Sebastian-Carter/dp/0853318514/ref=sr_1_2/002-4602721-8667219?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185825040&sr=1-2\r\n\r\nSadly
    the press is closing at the end of this year, Sebastian is downsizing and moving
    so the type and machinery is being sold off or given away (though i was assured
    to good homes) \r\n\r\nIt was a great visit, i could have happily stayed there
    all week, so much to learn and Sebastian was so kind and helpful \r\n "
