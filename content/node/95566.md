body: They say an author sometimes gets taken over by his characters and they, rather
  than he, decide the outcome of the story.  I felt a bit like that having designed
  (or begun the design) of Pagoda (see attached sample) which I intended to have a
  solidly mechanical feel.  I began with the lower case c which looked rather like
  the head of a spanner, and laboured on from there.  Pagoda, however, had other ideas
  and decided to reinvent itself as something decidedly delicate and oriental!  In
  the end I gave in played the part of the oily rag to the engineer!  Anyone else
  have a similar experience?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pagoda Poster_3500.png]

    the serifs into themselves like perfect circles, and eureka, there was Thai!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>They
    say an author sometimes gets taken over by his characters</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    the feeling I get when I'm working effectively. When everything I'm doing seems
    a natural choice.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm sketching, the first letter \"falls from the
    sky\", and what comes next ist just a reprise/reaffirmation of that. Most of the
    ideas take more time to unfold. I normally choose letters like /R/, /K/, /Q/,
    /k/, /a/, /g/, /z/ or /q/, that are more complex in construction, but I may also
    start, not with a specific character, but with a \"rhythm\", if i'm working with
    a broad nib.\r\n\r\nAfter all, all typefaces are just a single-glyph idea spread
    out into the rest of the character set, for the sake of consistency. The less
    characteristics you choose to stick to, the more \"mechanical\" a typeface will
    look, I guess."

    which is pretty much 100% straight lines, converted all lines to curves and made
    all connections smooth to see what I'd get. ... I  ended up with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ourhousegraphics/kush/\">Kush.</a>\r\nThe
    description on MyFonts, is a literal interpretation of the process; <site>\"Kush
    is what happens when you let your fonts sit around watching cartoons and eating
    cake and ice-cream all day\u2014When their vectors are freed from constraints
    and allowed to follow their bliss\"</cite>\r\nIt sounds like a \"just a few clicks
    and voila! A whole new font\" scenario but the amount of work involved in correcting
    shapes and connections, re-spacing and re-kerning was just about the same as starting
    from scratch.\r\n\r\nthe name, by the way, started out as \"Cushy\" for soft.
    The opposite of Silex. It looked better with a 'K'\r\n\r\n... Then my son says,

  body: Wow, I wasn't expecting quite such a profound philosophical response to my
    innocent question, especially from Flooce and Typerror!  Still I have read somewhere
    that to be 'inspired' is to be possessed by the spirits or gods, so maybe that's
    what was going on?  I quite like the idea of myself as an instrument of the divine,
    but more often than not I feel the same resignation as Nick Shinn.  Thank you
    all for your insights.

  body: "I have often felt this. It seems that designing a typeface can be rather
    like my dear friend Sean Stewart's experience of writing novels. At some point
    in the process you find the \"voice\" of the novel and follow it, even if it leads
    you in directions you did not originally intend. Things that conflict with that
    voice must be discarded, no matter how fabulous they might seem in and of themselves.
    I often have that experience with type design, where an interesting idea must
    be thrown away for the greater good of the typeface, because it doesn't fit with
    the whole.\r\n\r\nIn a typeface one may find one or two keystone glyphs that define
    the direction of the typeface, and then seeing for others whether they fit with
    those keystones, or not...."
