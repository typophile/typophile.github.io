body: "So, I've begun designing a typeface which mimics left handed characteristics.
  The way I see it I have two options: create a curled hand (crabclaw) or an uncurled
  hand.\r\n\r\nSome characteristics include a reversed ductus for the \"curled\" hand.
  \r\n\r\nIf it is uncurled, which is the the way I'm leaning (pun intended) I am
  also considering a left leaning \"roman\" to incorporate the left leaning writing
  that occurs when writing on a horizontal page. Currently I am working towards this
  left leaning \"roman\" (is that the right term?) and a more upright italic. Because
  the strokes are pushed in this situation, I am considering a contrast that thins
  proportionately from the start of the upstroke.\r\n\r\nSO \r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if anyone knew of anything attempted like this before? Any special characters that
  are unique to left handed writing (I've heard whispers of the K), and any general
  thoughts."

    the skull in Holbein's Ambassadors, or Parmigiano's self-portrait in a sphericall
    mirror.

    by that interest in reflections?"

  body: It's not early for writing and I think the page is set at a 45 degree angle
    and it was written with a right hand. It's a great find. I wonder who wanted read
    it enough to write it, and why.
