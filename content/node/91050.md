  is OK. When I come to generate I specify the folder then save. The progress bar
  goes all the way, yet the folder is empty. I do a search and it doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anybody have any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    don\u2019t they just add functionality and speed it up, not change existing modes?!\r\nI
    once spent all day \u201Csaving\u201D changes to a FLab file, only to discover
    that I wasn\u2019t permitted to do that, so as soon as I closed the VFB, it reverted
    to where I had started."

    setting that \"helpfully\" tracks down your document from three days ago and opens
    that, instead of the one you just saved three minutes ago.\r\n\r\nNick (top one),
    \ do you save your stuff in your Documents folder, or somewhere else on your hard
    disk?"

  body: Probably unrelated, but occasionally FLab will refuse to generate an OTF for
    some arcane reason or another. The only indication that it wasn't generated is
    a text line in the diagnostic panel, which I often miss!

  body: "<cite>'You should place languagesystem statements before any feature definition'
    never appeared before I updated to 5.1 and from Leopard to Snow Leopard. </cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    has to do with the fact that FLS 5.1 uses a more recent version of FDK than previous
    versions did. Snow Leopard isn't relevant here. However, this particular warning
    shouldn't prevent a font from being generated, so I'd focus your debugging efforts
    elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "The only useful clue in these kinds of messages is the line number following
    the path to <code>fontlab.fea</code>. Exporting the features and looking at that
    line in a text editor can sometimes help debugging, but in this case it seems
    to be in reference to the missing languagesystem warning rather than the fatal
    error. (Adding the statement <code>languagesystem latn dflt;</code> at the top
    of the global code area in the OpenType panel will placate the new compiler.)\r\n\r\nSee
    [[http://www.google.com/search?q=Please%2C+check+OpenType+features+definition+for+errors|previous
