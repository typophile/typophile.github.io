  writing up my phd thesis, and have decided to use garamond as the main font, but
  now I'd like something different as a font for the titles of the chapters, and the
  headers/footers.\r\n\r\nAny pointers to what might be suitable? Something more traditional,
  something less? I considered Bookman Old Style... \r\n\r\nI'm a natural scientist
  with no 'feel' for style whatsoever, and could use some help...\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    beautiful italicized 'z'... (but then, they all might be...)"

  body: "If you're going for this traditional look, you should probably use a slightly
    heavier version of Garamond (or similar old-style) for the footnotes. Sometimes
    called an \"optical\" size.\r\n\r\nGaramond Premier Pro is Adobe's latest version
    of the venerable style, and comes with \"optical\" sizes, as well as all the characters
    you would probably require for a thesis (including \"true\" superior figures for
    references).\r\n\r\nOnce you get the page format laid out in such a face, then
    you can consider a titling font: it may be the Display optical font of Garamond,
    or something quite different -- maybe even a bold sans, which could also be used
    for subheadings.\r\n\r\n"

    Christopher Dean, my thesis is basically about hormone signalling in plants after
    they perceive a herbivore. Effectively plant biology, with a bit of analytical
    chemistry and biology mixed in.\r\nIf it would be any help, I can try to post
    a picture of a chapter title page and a normal page of what I have now?\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the university I graduate has no requirements whatsoever for the thesis (only
    the content). \r\nI don't really like to mix a lot of fonts in a doc, but everything
    the same is a bit boring too. \r\nThe only thing about style I've ever learned
    is that mixing sans-serif with serif is a no-no, but don't even know if that is
    true anymore..."

    sans would be, imho, appropriate; like neutra face or verlag.

    a sans as a complementary font for serif bodytext is common practice. It all comes
    only down to the question: *which* sans?\r\nYou may do a search for \u201Chumanistic
    sans\u201D, e.g. on MyFonts.com. You can make the site display all fonts found
    with a test word like \u201CHamburgefonst\u201D. Take some time to look at it.
    You\u2019ll notice that some sans faces owe certain aspects of their aesthetics
    to faces like Garamond - and therefor may fit the bill."

    one: http://www.linotype.com/13061/syntaxbold-font.html\r\n"

    Garamond and is humanistic which is appropriate for your context.

    I've changed the font to garamond adobe pro (12pt), because it has ligatures.\r\nAs
    headings I now have garamond adobe pro in small caps, in 'caption' style, which
    looks alright, subheadings are garamond italic, 14pt.\r\n\r\nI might go for either
    something very frivolous for the headings (on the left page there's 'chapter 1'
    and on the right page there is 'Running Title'), or for a Sans-serif.\r\n\r\nI
    guess I won't use geometrical margins as I don't know how to correct for the printing
    margin and they take up a hideous amount of space.\r\n\r\nAnyway, cheers for all
    the help - I'll probably have some stupid questions later..."

    The abstract is the semibold version, the italic heading is garamond italic, and
    the subtitles are hoefler text - Ornaments (no idea how I came to this, I tried
    different things and I liked this)\r\nI chose the normal garamond italic because
    it looks nice, and it is different from the garamond pp italic, which I have to
    use regularly in the text to for species names, gene names, etc. \r\n\r\nThe title

    As for your headings: are they varied by size? weight? style? Pick one. Finally,

    would choose a smaller indent.'

    of words which must be set in all caps, and of numbers, especially years. As you
    have set them here, the HAMPS jump right off the page immediately. Could you try
    setting the acronyms in small caps, and the figures old style? That is the traditional
    way of working with a Garamond in text.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the page as a whole
    is good."

    this looks a bit busy here, is this exceptional - there are only a few instances
    (two or three) in the whole thesis where the subheadings are followed directly
    by a paragraph heading - in this instance I even added it myself (the 'introduction'
