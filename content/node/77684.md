body: "Some time ago I migrated my custom .enc files to FL 5 on the new Mac OS 10.6.
  Since then I face the mysterious fact that, when choosing them from the menu (in
  the Font window), in some instances only a part of the files\u2019 contents gets
  displayed, the rest is invisible (even in the glyph cell\u2019s heading).\r\n\r\nAre
  there special requirements to .enc files I am not aware of?\r\nAny insights on this? "

    is still there, then "Save As"; might work, might not, but it's worth a shot...

  body: "I opened the file(s) with Mac\u2019s TextEdit, all content was there. Then
    I \u201Dsaved as\u201C, choosing UTF-8 text encoding and applying the \u201D.enc\u201C
    suffix which TextEdit doesn\u2019t like very much, but it does it.\r\nThe odd
    thing is, some of the encodings render properly in FL, some don\u2019t. No clue
    so far about what makes the difference.\r\n\r\nBTW, in the old times I did the
    .enc-work in Simple Text. Worked smoothly. But Simple Text no longer runs under
    OS 10.6  :-("

    idea of progress. Kinda like all the ballyhoo about the Beatles finally being
    available on iTunes: only Apple would make a big deal about being the last one
    to the party..."

    an overall replacement of TextEdit, you can try Bean.
