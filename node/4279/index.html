  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR>I&#39;m a student working on a logo for a personal identity project.  I&#39;m attempting a playful, hand-drawn treatment of my name as a logo. Before I move on to using color, I am trying to address a couple of issues. <BR> <BR>First, something seems a little &#34;off&#34; about my letter forms. I cannot seem to put my finger on it, and I was hoping some of the more trained eyes here could help me out.  <BR> <BR>Secondly, I think the logo should be for &#39;Jason Yates Design&#34; not just &#34;Jason Yates&#34;, as just my name seems a little too personal. I would like to hear some thoughts on that, and if my treatment of the additional line of text is appropriate. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33432.gif" alt="personal logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason, I like the unifying quality that the common stroke has through A, T, and E, but it&#39;s easy to see &#34;Yales&#34; instead. Or &#34;Tates&#34; for that matter. <BR> <BR>You might want to further distinguish the Y by making the bowl of the J smaller or perhaps changing to a script-style &#40;right-side spine&#41; Y.  <BR> <BR>Had you considered making the lc &#34;ate&#34; more script-style, with a monocular a whose tail connected to the body of the t rather than the cross? You could connect the A and T at the baseline and the T and E using the cross.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it makes much more sense to have the &#34;design&#34; as a font, to offset the playfulness of the &#34;Jason Yates&#34;. The former is a craft, the latter is a person, so that makes for a nicely expressed duality. And of the three you have up there, Eurostile is best, although it seems a bit too rigid &#40;and too light&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason -- as a cartoonist, I have the feeling that your logo says cartoonist more than it does designer. Lettering is difficult to get just right and if you don&#39;t, you shoot yourself in the foot. Here are a couple of samples of very good lettering in the style you&#39;ve used, though they are lighter in weight. Get the feeling for the complete alphabet and be careful of hooking letters together unless you can do it in a pleasing way. Witty is even better. I suppose I must say that these examples appear courtesy of the advertisers who commissioned them. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33466.jpg" alt="baby oil"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33467.jpg" alt="Life Savers"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for all of your input so far, <BR> <BR>What paul said about the logo looking more like a cartoonist&#39;s logo really struck me as a problem, and I may need to re-examine the logo. What good would a designer be if their logo can&#39;t even convey properly what they do? <BR> <BR>I will go back and try something in the same spirit as what I have now, but says &#39;design&#39; more than &#39;doodle&#39;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just wanted to show this one, it&#39;s one last crack at it before I step away from this for a bit. I have tried revising these forms, and they all come out either too caligraphic, or begin to look too rigid. <BR> <BR>Here, I have taken many of your suggestions, switching the &#39;y&#39;, and playing with how I connect the letters. I need to distance myself from this for a while, and decide what I&#39;m doing. I like these current forms, but I&#39;m not sure how appropriate they look.
