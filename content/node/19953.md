  body: 'Please consider: digitize (also trace and autotrace) your work in FontLab
    or TypeTool. Avoid developing the habit of drawing outlines in Illustrator. The
    tools in FontLab/TypeTool are built for drawing glyphs. Switching between Illustrator
    and FontLab is unneccesary and can be frustrating, and a waste of time. '

  body: "Illustrator is valuble if you're making certain types of \"far out\" display
    fonts, with crazy effects and filters... distressed, \"grunge\" fonts and their
    ilk. The resulting garbage would still need to be cleaned up in TypeTool or FontLab.
    Crossgrove is right. \r\n\r\nIf you're short on cash TypeTool is a nice option.
    You can still open your projects in FontLab later to add OTF features, so there's
    really no downside that I can think of. "

  body: I agree with two - TypeTool for start, FontLab next. If money is an issue,
    definitely TypeTool. You might also start with Fontographer, then on to FontLab.
