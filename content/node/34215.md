  (part of the post-graduation programme in Architecture & Urbanism in S.Paulo/Brazil)
  but I was unable to find decent images to analyse since our library is not very
  good and it has been closed for several days due to a strike. What I need are good
  images of posters (especially the 1923 exhibition) and other representative pieces
  (book covers, advertising, etc.). Obviously there\u2019s stuff on Google but the
  quality, as you can imagine, is low.\r\nIf you have interesting images (Moholy-Nagy,
  Joost Schmidt, Herbert Bayer etc.) please send it to lore <cite>that symbol</cite>
  ukonline.co.uk  (stuffed if possible), it doesn't need to be very high res but good
  size and good quality would help. Eternally grateful.\r\n\r\nAnd feel free to discuss
  and post anecdotes, ideas etc. on the subject here!\r\nThank you. thank you, thank
  you.\r\n"

    a magazine cover by Herbert Bayer, taken from\r\nN Macmillan's recent \"An A-Z
    of Type Designers\".\r\nThat book also has an image of a The Foundry font\r\nbased
    on Bayer's work, but if you're interested in\r\nthat it might be better to get
    a clean imaging of it\r\ndirectly from The Foundry.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    here!\r\nThank you. thank you, thank you.</em>\r\n\r\nAround about the time cubism
    began playing itself out on the canvases of Picasso, Duchamp, Leger, Braque, et.
    al, came a new understanding throughout the art community which I believe was
    brought on by 'the machine'. Painting began to be identified with its two-dimensional
    support. No longer was it the external world, but the internal logic of the painting
    which began to dictate form. Surface organization gained over all representational
    depth. The compositional systems of academic painting were being deconstructed
    and then reconstructed as - Frontality.\r\n\r\nAlso, traditionaly speaking, form
    and space were talked about in terms of mass and volume, conventional techniques
    whether it be architecture, sculpture, painting, graphics or type etc., where
    forms which occupied a certain volume and suggested a certain weight. Form and
    space were talked about in terms of opposites, or as positive and negative. Space
    was only implied and measured by its displacement. Some works which seemed \"lighter\"
    than others indicated that mass was still the standard of referenece and space
    remained peripheral.\r\n\r\nInspired by the constructivists (and and to a certain
    extent the ideas of futurism), Bauhaus made space the essential basis of their
    art, whether it be in architecture, sculpture, painting, graphics, or type, etc.,,
    Bauhaus considered works produced by conventional methods, no matter how stylized,
    to be naturalistic, static, and subjective, because it reflected personal feeling.
    Bauhaus is the influence of modern physics and geometry and the machine, and not
    the visualization of science.\r\n\r\nBut just prior to Bauhaus, guys like Mondrian
    and Matisse were to have an enormous influence on Herr Gropius, Itten and Le Corbu
    too for that matter. Colour and texture were now elements of specific information,
    indications that 'spoke' for themselves. Colour acquired its independence and
    autonomized line. The artist now drew on the coloured areas, the line - graffti
    - freed from the constraints of the effect of reality, developed according to
    its autonomous rhythm.\r\n\r\nThis is when Bayer, Moholy-Nagy, Klee, amoungst
    many others, really came into their own. Bayer's painting 'Alphabet' of 1927 comes
    to mind - but then so too does the whole of Itten's method of teaching - the teaching
    of opposites. Other examples - Picasso's 'Man in the Hat' of 1912, Klee's 'The
    Vocal Fabric of the Singer Rosa Silber' of 1922, and Mohonly-Nagy's sculpture
    'Space Modulartor' of 1940, all on the heels of Frontalism. I think Frontalism
    and to a certain extent constructivism and futurism, shaped guys like Itten and
    Bayer et. al, and all that they were to produce - except for Mohonly-Nagy who
    I think was just a wonderer. But it was Herr Gropius and Le Corbusier too, that
    were to be totally consumed by 'the machine'.\r\n\r\nI'm  beginning to ramble...
    need more wine... ahhh, that's better!\r\n\r\nI'm really interested to see how
    you peg Bayer to Bauhaus and Herr Gropius and his want of 'the machine'. \r\n\r\nGropius
    was just a punk - looking for the funk.\r\n\r\nOkay, ok, I've said enough...\r\n\r\n_________\r\nHiro "

  body: "have more wine, Hiro. I admit I've never been particularly fascinated by
    Bauhaus in general but now that I have to prepare this little talk I find myself
    reading books on bauhaus history like a thriller, there's everything: politics,
    international intrigue, back-stabbing and I've also rediscovered Moholy-Nagy,
    I guess one of the most interesting characters in the Bauhaus. There's a brilliant
    article in the Guardian (2006 I think) where the author tells how he was snobbed
    in England <cite>London Transport's design impresario Frank Pick expressed a widely
    held artistic xenophobia in dismissing Moholy-Nagy as \"a gentleman with a modernistic
    tendency who produces pastiches of photographs of a surrealistic type, and I am
    not at all clear why we should fall for this. It is international, or at least
    continental. Let us leave the continent to pursue their own tricks\"</cite> and
    how they regret it now.\r\nAnyway, mine is going to be a panoramic of Bauhaus
    graphic production, the Bauhaus Books, portfolios etc.\r\nBy the way, Ralf your
    photos are awesome but I have a question if you're there, the photo of a publication
    called Utopia- Dokumente der Wirklichkeit you posted [by Oskar Schlemmer], what
    is that about exactly?  Thanks."
