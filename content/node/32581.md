  york, conspicuous consumption era...opera concert programme\" type of font.\r\n\r\nOne
  of the typefaces I am looking for is a script typeface that will work well with
  a bolder more masculine typeface like Copperplate. I am not too fond of Copperplate
  though, so if someone could suggest a similar typeface to it that would be great!\r\n\r\n(so
  far i have paired copperplate with bickham...but am not too happy)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
