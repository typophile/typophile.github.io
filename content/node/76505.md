  their related topics. I invite you to join, add and edit content. Please use your
  real name and include a short description of who you are when signing up. You have
  to be signed up to edit the content, but the content is readable by everyone. The
  project is fully non-commercial, but you are of course free to use the information
  in the wiki to produce commercial fonts. Don't worry about entering complete data,
  editing is what the wiki system is good at.\r\n\r\nFeel free to spread the word

  body: "Fontstandards.org is solely concerned with technical aspects relating to
    the planning and production of font files. So the scope is more narrowly delineated.
    More importantly though, fontstandards.org is based on the fully featured MediaWiki
    system \u2013 the same as Wikipedia uses. This allows for tracking of changes,
    full revision history, and discussions can be done behind the individual articles
    on special pages."
