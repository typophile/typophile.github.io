  may just be a version of Futura that was modified, just curious if it isn&#39;t.'

    Bergen</a>, but the typeface on the cover looks bolder. Whaddayathink, Stephen?

  body: North Bergen is close, but look at the lower case h, the counters are different.
    Same with the e. With the e I could buy that the differences was just a function
    of how the graphics were made, but the h has me wondering.

  body: Actually, I&#39;m full&#39;o&#39;crap. It&#39;s definitely not North Bergen.
    Uppercas &#34;C&#34; for example is waaay different. This is another case of jumping
    to conclusions <a href="http://typographi.ca/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=476">
    a tad too quickly</a>.

  body: seems like someone took Futura, mixed with some  <BR>characters &#40;S, s,
    t&#41; from a grotesque font like  <BR>Akzidenz and blurred the whole thing.

    can&#39;t pin it down.
