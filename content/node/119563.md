  body: "Ben, luxury brands rarely use an off-the-shelf typeface\u2014it makes it
    too easy for counterfeiters to knock off their products.\r\n\r\nSomeone else may
    recognize it, but I'm sticking with my original assessment until proven otherwise."

    searching on individual letters on three separate type databases.\r\n\r\nHiatus
    by Stephen Rapp comes close, and showed up in search results of several letters:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/hiatus/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hiatus_4895.png]"

  body: "I spent a little time researching this via trademark registration. Here is
    the earliest version of the logo I could find\u2014it was in use from 1948 to
    1996:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dporthault_1948_1996_5710.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's
    the mark from its 1984 Canada trademark registration:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DPorthaultCanada_1984_4542.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's
    how the mark looked on the company's website in 2003 (via archive.org):\r\n\r\n
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/dportaultApr2003_5818.png]\r\n\r\nAnd again
    in 2004:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DPortaultJul2004_3893.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    company was sold in 2005, and I could get none of the archive.org links to work
    for 2005, 2006, or 2007. February 2008 is the first instance I could find of the
    logo in it's current form:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dporthaultFeb2008_5138.png]\r\n\r\nBased
    on this progression, I think it's pretty clear that the logo has been redrawn
    and refined from earlier versions (the most noticeable difference over the last
    decade being the removal of the horizontal foot on the P and the redrawing of
    the crest). I suspect the original was based on Daniel Porthault's own signature
    (or one drawn by his wife Madelaine, who was the creative force behind the company).\r\n\r\n"
