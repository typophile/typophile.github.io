  I am especially interested in sans-serif fonts as they tend to be 'safe' for corporate
  websites.\r\n\r\nI am looking for something that works well in bolder than regular
  with enough weights to get a scale working on nested headerings for online content.\r\n\r\nUp
  to now I have looked at Avenir, Univers, Gotham and Interval\u2026"

  body: "Yes, actually I have a project, but I am really more generally interested.\r\nI
    found that Frutiger is generally very thin and seems a little lost in headings,
    Gotham is the opposite, ie. very wide.\r\n\r\nI seem to have pendled into Univers
    or Avenir. Univers seems bold overall, Anivers a little bit more natural. What
    do others think about these two, or even about these two + Frutiger. After all
    they are all his cuts and quite similar, or not?"

  body: "Just about any font out there could work for headings online, though there
    are some technical considerations:\r\n\r\nOnly a few are considered so called
    web safe fonts, due to the fact that they are installed on nearly every computer
    out there. In your CSS file you generally specify a typeface, and rely on the
    user to have it. In addition there is the @font-face tag which uses truetype fonts,
    eot fonts and/or woff fonts (have a look at Typekit, or the web fonts section
    on Fontshop.com). Replacing the text with an image (or a flash file) depicting
    your specific text is also possible, but cumbersome and troublesome when you\u2019re
    dealing with screen readers, searches and iPhones/iPads (who do not support Flash).
    In any case, rember to read the EULA of the font you decide to use, as it\u2019s
    not a given that you are allowed to use it online."
