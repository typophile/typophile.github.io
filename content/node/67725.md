  and the wonderful enthusiastic discussions that typographers have here!\r\n\r\nAs
  a designer in her first year of professional work, I've encountered a question that
  has gone unanswered for some time. \r\n\r\nHaving read books by great designers
  (Vignelli, Bringhurst etc.) as well as this forum I became enthusiastic about the
  use of baseline grids in my work. This technique had not been taught at university
  and once I began to practice using the baseline grid in my personal work I found
  that I could hardly do without it. \r\n\r\nHowever, at not ONE of the studios I
  have worked in to date (about 4 or 5 so far)has any designer been in the practice
  of using a baseline grid. Furthermore, I have found that rather than hard using
  hard returns, half line gaps etc., most designers specify their paragraph spacing
  in millimeters. My question is, is using millimeters for paragraph spacing bad practice
  when line spacing is being specified in another unit (points) as therefore the values
  for line spacing and paragraph spacing have no relationship?\r\n\r\nMy second question
  arises from an art director having asked me to make the y-co ordinate of each object
  on a page in InDesign a whole number as they believed that this reflected typographic
  discipline, as opposed to placing objects with a y-coordinate that involved a decimal
  point, e.g. 5.65. What are your opinions on this?\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post!
  I would appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts on these two questions!\r\n\r\nmany
  thanks! "

  body: "Your art directors are asses!\r\n\r\nSince the proper and classic unit of
    measurement for type is points, so should the measurement for paragraphs be. Otherwise,
    as you said, there is no relationship. It's very hard to tell what a corps 9 points
    does with leading 6 mm, but everyone (except your art directors possibly) understands
    12 points with leading 14 points. Using points in stead of millimeters gives you
    way much more control and finesse of what you're doing.\r\n\r\nThere are some
    classic formats to paragraph layout, for instance 8 leading 10, 9 leading 11,
    10 leading 12, 14 leading 18 et cetera. That's typographic discipline! Possibly
    this answers your second question too. Because in most cases the leading will
    be expressed as a whole number, but in points, not in millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe
    baseline grid is one of the most important things in layout software, especially
    when designing magazines or books. \r\n\r\nIt all comes down to practise of course,
    so when you're used to using millimeters, no harm done. But for me, as a classicly
    trained graphic designer, millimeters is not the way to go.\r\n\r\n"

    (and I grew up in Canada).\r\n\r\nI'm a firm believer in working on the baseline
    grid. \r\nThat said, I also think you can break rules if you know the rules. There
    are some times when it's not essential to the solution. \r\n\r\nAs for y-coordinate
    relationships...\r\nPrecision is key and rarely does something need to sit at
    Y: 3.2713\" instead of 3.3\". If multiple people are working in documents it's
    important to work on A GRID (even if it's not the baseline grid). Tidy design
    is good practice to adopt (the production team will love you if you make their
    job easier).\r\n\r\nMy pet peeve is type set at weird random sizes (9.674583 pt???).\r\nIt's
    just sloppy."

    very talented designers who don't care about the rules, not so much in a F-You-I'm-David-Carson
    way either. Blame the software and paper sizes.\r\n\r\n<cite>My question is, is
    using millimeters for paragraph spacing bad practice when line spacing is being
    specified in another unit (points) as therefore the values for line spacing and
    paragraph spacing have no relationship?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn InDesign the typographic
    units don't match. It wants you to define leading and type size in points but
    all of the layout decisions are in mm or inches (margins, tabs, indents, even
    baseline grid and paragraph spacing). The best thing you can do is find a baseline
    grid that works in both points and mm or inches. \r\n\r\n<cite>My second question

    sounds retarded. Actually all of this sounds like how designing in powerpoint
    works. "

  body: "My opinion is somewhat different.\r\n\r\nAs type uses points, makes more
    sense to use leading also in points. This makes easier to identify the relationship
    between one and other measure. The same is less evident in space after/before
    paragraphs as these measures are completely independent from type sizes.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, to use points in all measures is more natural to most people as we set
    type size with this unit since the very first time we got in touch with type.
    But in countries where the metric decimal system is adopted, people learn to <em>think</em>
    in meters, centimeters and millimeters since childhood. In this scenario, to use
    millimeters in measures except type itself is not so strange.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    this a clear matter of right-or-wrong, but much more a question about the measurement
    system which people are used to. If a designer feels comfortable to use 4,8mm
    as leading and has the exact notion about which space this represents, there is
    no problem to prefer mm instead of pt. Difficulties may arise only due to the
    workflow of this publication. So the real good practice I see here is not to adopt
    a schema which just you understands or manages.\r\n\r\nAlthough I use type/leading
    in pt, I prefer to use space before/after in mm. In my brain the notion of space
    in mm is more exact as I always used them. I do this for many years and never
    found any problem. Rules? Well, one must respect the rules as they are here for
    some reason. But one must not blindly follow a rule just because it exists.\r\n\r\nTalking
    about rules, take for example Bringhurst's deep study about page margins and proportions
    in <em>Elements of Typographical Style</em>. It's a very good set of criteria
    to define page sizes and margins. But must I adopt them just because there is
    a geometrical definition behind? These large external and bottom margins Bringhurst
    himself uses are geometrical results. Anyway, as a reader I look to the book and
    find these margins excessive. There is very much blank space at bottom of page
    and this uneven fulfilling is not comfortable for me \u2013and for many other
    readers, as I verified while teaching design. So, I don't follow these highly
    geometric rules, even if they are presented by a master as Bringhurst.\r\n\r\nAs
    someone already said, you must known the rules, you cannot ignore them \u2013but
    you may not follow a rule it if there is a good reason to do so.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the position for graphics, it seems that art director read half of the instructions
    and mixed something. To put graphic elements at integer positions is correct when
    you're using a grid with integer increments. Outside this, IMHO just the position
    of other elements (titles, boxes) need to be observed."

  body: ">  asked me to make the y-co ordinate of each \r\n> object on a page in InDesign
    a whole number\r\n\r\nI had a corporate client once who had a rule that all coordinates
    and object sizes in InDesign had to be rounded off the the nearest point (or 1/2
    point for type itself), unless there was a good reason not to. Their reasoning
    was that tiny fractions made the job more complex when communicating or matching
    sizes & coordinates.\r\n\r\nAt the time it seemed silly to me, but I've gradually
    adopted that practice myself. For example, if I draw a border guideline and notice
    its 2.99 picas from the page edge, I'll make 3 picas. \r\n\r\nIt just seems a
    bit more clean and precise, plus it makes life easier if later you're trying to
    confirm that sizes are consistent from page to page. \"I need to remember that
    column one should always be 20.03 picas wide, and column 2 should always be 11.97
    picas wide\". Easier to make it \"column one is always 20 picas and column 2 is
    always 12 picas wide\".\r\n\r\nBut obviously design considerations should come
    first. \r\n\r\nJames"
