  setting text 10/12 on a 26p0 measure, but the face's large eye makes the page a
  tad too dark in my opinion. I'm now playing with 10/14, and was wondering if anyone
  else has used Caecilia for extended text who would care to share their experiences.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nErik"

    the room, but I'll say that to my eyes as well, Caecilia seems to be happier with
    quite a lot of leading. I've set it at 10/15 before, but that was at a measure
    of 26p8. Come to think of it, I wonder if 10pt on a 26p0 measure isn't a bit on
    the large side? It seems to accommodate just over 2 lc alphabets (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc). "

    26p0 gives me a fairly consistent 60 characters per line, which seems perfect.\r\n\r\n<cite>a

  body: "The slight condensing I suggested is a way to use a slightly larger size
    and still have the same character/line count. And Caecilia being a very well designed
    typeface, it can withstand this practice. And 92% is the limit imho. Try it with
    some arithmatic (characters/line as a constant \u2014 stepping up the size in
    quarter points).\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
