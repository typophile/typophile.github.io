  in latin, cyrillic.\r\nBut the arab is becoming one of the hardest steps of my work.
  Unlike the latin now I having problems to evaluate the space between the letters
  and the high of some of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nI do not know the Arabic language, nor
  Russian.\r\n\r\nBelow are a few words written in Arabic, can you tell me if they
  are spelled correctly?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n"

  body: Have you tried comparing your typeface with a regular arabic typeface in your
    operating system? Because the sample you are showing here seems a bit illegible
    to me. I can read arabic script but not the arabic language just farsi. Contrast
    is reversed in arabic script so horizontal lines are thicker. This is not a universal
    rule but this could make your design ugly or beautiful in eyes of many designers.
    I can't point to some of the glyphs here but the last letter in the fifth line
    should be similar to the second letter in the seventh line and the difference
    is only in the dots. But in your design shape of the base character is also different
    which in the fifth line looks better. Any way you are better off showing the character
    set view of the font.
