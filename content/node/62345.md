  body: "The second sample in particular shows that the \"messing\" was done just
    for that occasion.\r\n\r\n@Mike: Hi, yes, I didn't have much time for typography
    recently (8 years). Pleasant surprise you even remembered my nick. I still use
    (and recommend) your script and bauhaus font ID pages - very useful contribution
    for the community.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: Thank you, Mike. Hope the comeback will last. At present it's because I've
    caught a cold and the doctor told me to stay in bed - so I've time to play with
    my font collection ;-)
