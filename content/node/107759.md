      I'm NOT very talented and my IQ is just average (around 90-105). I may not be
      physically disabled, but man, I'm one of the MOST unluckiest people in the world.
      :(\r\n\r\nLike you, there are fonts that I seek too like: Compatil Exquisit,
      DTL Dorian, FS Sally, and Optima Nova. I don't just seek them. In fact, I crave
      for those stuffs so bad! And I can't even afford any of them, which sucks a
      big time for me.\r\n\r\nSo out of desperation, instead doing something like
      this, I have decided to do the other way around. To design a font for my personal
      typing and printing pleasure, as well as to somehow fill the gap.\r\n\r\nHere's
      my progress so far.\r\nI'm yet to make the italic by next week (hopefully),
      so I can only show you the roman characters.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i1288.photobucket.com/albums/b499/iamdead324/smpl-spcmn_zps5bbb2c05.jpg\"

      which I made on May, this year(2013), is a complete disaster. XD\r\n\r\nIn text

      things. As long as you're willing to do it, then you can most likely find a
      way to make it. And do not be afraid to fail, for everybody has failures in
      life, especially the first time.\r\nAnd in your case, since that you GOT a lot
      of talent, for the love of God, use it! You'll only live once, so don't let
      your talents rot in vain.\r\n\r\nNow, since that you have a very high IQ, I'm
      sure you already realized that people tend to buy useless stuffs just because
      they want it. Those impractical decisions for temporary satisfaction is a significant
      thing that makes us humans, is it not? :)\r\nI don't think it's such a big issue
      if you sometimes set aside the essentials to buy something you want. It's impractical,
      yes, but not completely stupid, imo.\r\n\r\nSo if you have the chance to buy
      some of the fonts you seek, then go for it.\r\n\r\nBut I highly encourage you
      to attempt to make your own fonts. And it's also a privilege, because since
      you are the designer, you can make it fit perfectly to your own taste and style,
      without any kind of disrespect.\r\n\r\nI recommend TypeTool, but if you really
      don't want to throw a buck, you're still in luck. There is a font production
      software called \"FontForge\" which is absolutely free of charge!\r\n\r\nTrust
      me man. There's no harm in trying.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and sorry for
      the looooooooong post.\r\n\r\n\r\n - Nate"

    The font design cannot be copyrighted but the underlying code which makes up the
    font is. Designs can be patented but it is quite costly.\r\n2. Designers make
    a pittance in most cases. Exclusivity has nothing at all to do with it.\r\n\r\nEvery
    single font you listed above is a commercial font and they are not \"free for

    \"several thousand dollars\", as you put it. The vast majority are less than $50.\r\n\r\nTypophile
    is definitely not the place to be asking for free commercial fonts. As another

    body: "1. The last time I looked the Avenir font package cost several thousand
      dollars. \r\n\r\n2. I asked if any of you could recommend any fonts for certain
      specific applications.\r\n2a. None of you answered even one of these questions.\r\n\r\n3.
      When someone downloads a font they would never buy because they \r\n     can't
      afford the font, no one loses one penny, and the world benefits. \r\n\r\n4.
      In any event, I am pretty sure I read somewhere the actual artists and \r\n
      \    designers make very little money from the sale of their fonts. All the
      \r\n      money goes to people who exploit the creative talent of the actual
      \r\n      font designers. \r\n\r\n5.  I doubt any successful designer would
      care that I used their font \r\n      for the purposes I intended to use them.
      \ I presume if they knew\r\n      me and knew my situation, they would permit
      me free use of their \r\n      font for the use I intended. If I had someway
      of contacting the\r\n      actual font designers, I would write them a letter
      and ask them \r\n      myself. \r\n\r\n6.  I am not a designer, nor do I ever
      intend to become a designer. \r\n\r\n7.  I went to all the foundries and asked
      if I could buy a package of\r\n      fonts I wanted for personal use at a reasonable
      cost, and they\r\n      were all pretty nasty. They had no interest in doing
      business with \r\n      me.  None of these foundries makes these fonts available
      to the\r\n      public for personal use at a reasonable price. \r\n    \r\n7.
      \  I am not familiar with the exact procedures people use to acquire\r\n       software
      or fonts that are normally sold.  I will ask a friend of mine\r\n       who
      is an expert with computers to obtain the fonts I seek from \r\n       Pirate
      Bay or some other file sharing web site. I just visited Pirate\r\n       Bay,
      and it seems I can get all the \"commercial\" fonts for free not\r\n       just
      the ones I was looking for.\r\n\r\n8.   I will make sure all the effort I put
      into this pursuit is not wasted. \r\n       It is ashame I am going to have
      to take this route. The more I \r\n       sour on humanity, the less I care
      about others. \r\n\r\n9.   If the designers of successful commercial fonts really
      had a\r\n       conscience, they would help new designers get fairly compensated\r\n
      \      for their efforts. All hugely successful font designers just care \r\n
      \      about are themselves, or they would sponsor the creation of a\r\n       fairer
      system.\r\n\r\nI am not a material guy. If I had carried about making money,
      I could\r\nhave been a wealthy a long time ago. All my life I have helped \r\neveryone
      who has ever asked me for help. My not being able to earn\r\na living now is
      not just hurting me, it hurts US taxpayers. I could paying\r\ntaxes instead
      of having to rely on your taxes to pay my basic expenses. \r\n\r\nAt one point
      in my life, I could have discovered a cure for cancer or\r\nmade a significant
      contribution to mankind's energy needs. But our\r\nsociety makes it hard for
      talented people to realize their potential. \r\n\r\nHumans are a foolish species.
      They think life is a zero sum game. \r\nInstead of trying to help each other,
      they seek to take advantage of\r\neach other. \r\n\r\nAs far as fonts not being
      able to be copyrighted in the US, I believe that\r\n\"MS Segoe UI\" is a knock-off
      Frutiger. Frutiger sued MS in Europe and\r\nwon, but lost in the US because
      in the US fonts can't be copyrighted.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to know if their were
      high-quality knockoffs of the fonts \r\nI listed.\r\n\r\nUS laws in general
      are designed to protect corporations and those\r\nwho can afford lobbyists.
      \ US patent laws don't protect poor US\r\ninventors. Bill Gates was able to
      rip-off Gary Kildall.  John Pierpont\r\nMorgan ripped-off the original Tesla
      and Westinghouse.  The only\r\npeople able to get justice in our legal system
      are people who already\r\nhave money. Even the Wright Brothers were not able
      to benefit from\r\ntheir discovery of the airplane. And you care about wealthy
      designers\r\nwho wouldn't lose one penny from my personal use of their fonts?
      \r\n\r\nI am sorry I came here asking you for help. I won't be back. There \r\nwas
      a time I would not have thought twice about risking my life to\r\nhelp any human,
      or thought twice about giving the shirt off my back \r\nto help anyone truly
      in need.  Now as time passes, I can't stop myself\r\nfrom inwardly smiling every
      time a fellow American is a victim of \r\ncrime or suffers some loss. \r\n\r\nI
      am not happy with the person I am becoming. I wish I had a way \r\nto stop it.
      It has nothing to do with no one here helping me with my\r\nrequest. It has
      to to with the general nature of human beings today. \r\n\r\nI wish all of you
      the very best. I hope none of you ever run into \r\nanyone like the person I
      may eventually become against my will. \r\nI really hope I don't become that
      person, because that would be \r\nthe opposite of everything I have fought for
      my entire life. \r\n\r\nOnce again, my reaction here has nothing to do with
      your lack of\r\nof help.  Fonts don't have that kind of importance to me. I
      won't\r\nmiss them, if I don't get them. What bothers me is the selfish world\r\nwe
      live in today; how no one is willing to help anyone else in desperate \r\nstraits.
      \ Helping someone with fonts is a trivial, but even something \r\nso little
      as help with fonts is hard to come by these days. \r\n\r\nI hope someday someone
      distributes all your precious commercial\r\nfonts free so all members of the
      public have free use of them. After\r\nseeking your help here, that is the feeling
      I come away with. "

    into \"us\" versus \"them.\" Moreover, \"us\" and \"them\" constantly form and
    reform as the topic changes. If you're from a species that has moved beyond such
    arbitrary classifications, good fortune to you -- though you're already quite
    far along the line of good fortune if you've moved beyond us versus them.\r\n\r\nYet
    that assumption makes your bitter, puerile attack hard to understand..."

  body: The posts from "cyberflor" remember me those from Gustavo, a young guy who
    came here asking for free fonts about two years ago. As expected, he received
    negative feedback from us and begun to attack everybody mixing nonsense arguments
    and unpolite vocabulary. Gustavo came back some months later using another nickname
    but causing similar confusion. Both these accounts were closed. If cyberflow is
    not the same person, he/she is surely following Gustavo's behavior manual. Anyway,
    it is clear that logic does not work in these kind of thread.
