  body: This reminds me of lettering I saw years ago that a guy had done in a similar
    fashion. He had placards all over his van covered in type similar to this - all
    about corrupt lawyers, conspiracy plot, blah, blah, blah. Wonder if there's some
    kind of medical diagnosis for this, besides crazy.

    It's plain outrageous when someone imposes their religious beliefs on our environment.
    \ If you really can't get enough of god's words paint the INTERNAL walls of your
    house (and don't leave the house!). Here in Brazil people sell their external
    walls to companies and the whole city has been turned into a giant billboard.
    \r\n\r\nIt's her house and she can do what she wants? Nonsense.  It's OUR environment,
    our landscape and what she does is too bloody invasive. And she didn't do it for
    \"love of typography\" either, did she? Personality? Harmless? Give me a break..."
