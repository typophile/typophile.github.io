  market, by which I mean large, older trees. This means that I needed to find something
  classy, timeless, and also that I have something like ten years to come up with
  a good design.\r\n\r\nI started out trying to incorporate an acorn or an oak leaf
  or a tree or something iconic. The acorn I couldn't get to not look stupid, a partial
  oak leaf I couldn't get to not look like a Far Side character in profile, and the
  tree just looked trite. Also, various attempts at \"classy\" fonts seemed to be
  quickly dated.\r\n\r\nSo I wound up with just this, which is one of the Fell typeface-lookalikes
  from Igino Marini and one of its flowers. I think it captures a colonial Vermont
  feel without being too dated. But is it too bland; i.e., does it need a graphic?
  Thoughts? Suggestions? General comments? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ecn_6702.png]"

    else do you have? Maybe a a nice old metal font on real paper is what you actually
    want. Or something made by a stone carver. Like Douglas Coffin in Maine. Look
    him him up.\r\n\r\nHere\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lettercutter.com/\r\n"

  body: "High end & hand made really go together. Gorey is right in the sense that
    his letters were neo-conservative in inspiration if not in execution. It's a conservative
    landed class thing you are wanting to tap into here. And Gorey is right because
    his stuff was hand made. But it is wrong in the sense that decrepitude and whimsy
    enter into it. That's why I think hand lettering could get you what you want.
    Or in a pinch the right Caslon might do. Or very early Dutch type. You might look
    at the heavy weight of Amalia too. It isn't down the path I have described but
    it might be a surprisingly good fit. You can find Amalia here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ourtype.be/\r\n"

    And, I do agree, be careful of being too precious.\r\n\r\n"
