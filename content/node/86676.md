body: Hi, Can anyone please help us identify this font? It was created by our Graphic
  Designer about 7 years ago but we never had the font seperately available to be
  able to recreate our company logo. Can anyone help us identify this great font?
  Thanks in advance. Nick

    to be honest I'm not one of them.\r\nI just used some piece of software to find
