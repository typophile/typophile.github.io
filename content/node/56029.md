body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI've had a Typophile account for quite a while, though I've not
  posted much. But now I'm working on a project and I'd really appreciate your input.\r\n\r\nI've
  been asked by an international not-for-profit organisation to work on their corporate
  identity. Right now they've got a logo, but that's about all. There are no identity
  guidelines or even a standard typeface.\r\n\r\nSo, one of the first things I want
  to do is choose a typeface. But it's hard, because of a couple of things that must
  be reckoned with:\r\n\r\n- The organisation isn't very large (not many employees),
  but it's very international, people all over the world will have to work with this
  typeface. Therefore I'm looking for something with a very broad characterset that
  supports as many languages as possible.\r\n- They are willing to buy some licences,
  but they're not rich and many people working with this identity are actually volunteers.
  So I'm looking for a solution that isn't expensive. In their headquarters they've
  got Indesign CS4, so they own a couple of licenses for the fonts that come with
  it.\r\n- They asked me to take into account their newly redesigned website, which
  uses Georgia (mainly for headlines) and Arial (mainly for body copy).\r\n\r\nIt's
  quite a puzzle!\r\nIdeally I'd like to continue using both a serif and a sans serif
  typeface, like in the website. But since buying licenses for 1 font for everyone
  might be a problem, specifying 2 paid-for fonts will not be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI've
  considered continuing using Georgia and Arial. By far the cheapest and most convenient
  option (they've both got a large character set and nearly everybody with a pc owns
  them). But Georgia was made for screen (although I must say, I rather like it in
  print) and doesn't have small caps - and I hate Arial.\r\n\r\nAnother solution could
  be to use Minion and Myriad - they've got everything I need and some of our future
  users already own them. But I think they're a bit lacking in personality.\r\n\r\nI've
  looked at Gentium, which is free and looks quite promising, but it's not quite ready
  yet.\r\n\r\nI wonder what you all think, and if you can think of other options?\r\nAll
  input would be greatly appreciated."

  body: "Thanks for your attention :-)\r\nIt's an organization for libraries all over
    the world. This means theoretically: all languages. But I don't think that's very
    realistic. More reasonable might be: Western and Eastern European, Greek and Cyrillic
    languages. \r\nMost of their communication is in English, but they also publish
    brochures in Russian en Arab."

    fonts support the Latin, Cyrillic (with Asian Cyrillic) and Greek (with Polytonic)
    scripts, if you're looking for an alternative to Apple/Adobe/Microsoft.\r\nBut
    I'm afraid I don't give them away! However, I am always willing to consider specific
    licensing proposals.\r\n\r\nAlso suitable: <a href=\"http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/oldstandard.html\">Old

  body: I work in an international organisation and use Myriad and Minion for the
    exact same reasons you mention :) You could always substitute Arno for Minion
    if you want more personality.

    it is for libraries, Arno can be substituted to get a much better look

  body: "Thanks for your replies!\r\nI'm still trying to find out how many people
    will need to work with these fonts and how much money is available for licenses.
    \r\nI've been in touch with Fontshop about fonts with large character sets and,
    in case anyone else is curious, they've come up with these options:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>FF
    Din Pro</li>\r\n<li>FF Meta Pro</li>\r\n<li>FF Kievit Pro</li>\r\n<li>FF Maiola
    Pro</li>\r\n<li>FF Daxline Pro</li>\r\n<li>Helvetica World</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nArno
    is a good suggestion, too! Unfortunately it isn't included with CS4, so I don't
    even own it myself (yet), having upgraded from CS2 to CS4... I will go and look
    for it, though."
