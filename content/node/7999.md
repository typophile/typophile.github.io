  move on to magazine design when I finish college this year. How does that work?
  are magazines designed by in-house teams or by design studios? <BR>Any recommended
  readings, books, for magazine design? <BR> <BR>thanks you all

  body: The basic layout is made by in-house teams, but it depends on the magazine
    if the overall design is by them or a design studio.
