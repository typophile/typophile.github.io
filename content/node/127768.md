  typefaces used here:\r\n\r\nfor GRACE:\r\n- I think it is a modified Adequate Light.
  Please confirm.\r\n\r\nfor GOSPEL:\r\n- I think it is similar to the typeface of

  what -\u7075\u60E0\u5802 (Linghuitang) means really\r\n- not sure if I need to add
  the white box in the .png file when rendering the logo\r\n- might use the default

    should be able to supply you with that.\r\n\r\nGRACE appears to be a modification
    of Gotham Light, GOSPEL and CHURCH are Gotham Regular:\r\nhttps://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/styles/\r\n\r\nOFFERING
    BOX appears to be News Gothic Demi:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/news-gothic/\r\n\r\nThe
