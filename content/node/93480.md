body: "I am trying to find the Bembo used on Section 25 - Always now album, designed
  by Peter Saville. It has to be Berthold Bembo as it written on the album itself
  but it's slightly different from the ones I found. You can understand it from the
  letter \"g\". The numbers are Bembo Small Caps obviously, but that \"g\" made me
  crazy.\r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated,\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fac_45_lg_4150.jpg]"
