  body: "Nyala is being shipped with Windows Vista to add support for the Ethiopic
    script. From its description:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Ethiopic characters were designed
    by [[John Hudson]], based on initial drawings by [[Geraldine Wade]]. The Latin
    characters were designed by John Hudson, and harmonise with the Ethiopic to facilitate
    the typesetting of texts including un-transliterated foreign names, technical
    terms, etc.</cite>\r\n\r\n"
