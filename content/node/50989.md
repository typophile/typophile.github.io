  been trying MailDrop but I am having problems with its css support and I would like
  to know what other option are available (if possible under OSX).\r\n\r\nThanks in

    with.\r\n\r\nMost folks use online services for this such as campaignMonitor\r\n\r\n"

  body: I looked into web-based software at work for sending out html newsletters
    a couple of months ago and the one that most suited our needs was called Constant
    Contact, based in USA, pretty good value for money and nice user interface with
    lots of templates to customise.
