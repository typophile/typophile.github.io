  body: "I tried the site on Chrome and Safari and I don't get by the poorly kerned
    180 in the circle.\r\n\r\nWhatever the font is, it's based on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_medium/?&sample_text=180&sample_size=74&acs_pt=32&affid=99346\">DIN</a>."

  body: It's been a while since I worked in Flash, but I recall you can adjust how
    type anti-aliases, including turning it off. I would guess this is just straight
    DIN.

  body: "Sorry guys, I guess I should be more specific. I'm referring to the copy,
    not the 180. \r\n\r\n@workwork, I never work in flash so if it is DIN with anti-aliasing
    turned off that will be a problem. "

  body: You can turn the anti-aliasing off in Photoshop for a similar effect, if that's
    what you need.
