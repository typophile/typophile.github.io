  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adobe_4316.gif]\r\nYeah, thanks for mentioning
    this. I hadn't noticed it was posted. I also like seeing the old logo on the first
    slide. It kind of says, \"Hey, we've been doing this for awhile.\""

    the cover of a binder that is lying around, which used to document all the in-house
    tools and processes. I thought it was cool, and so decided to take a picture of
    it for using in the cover slide. I'm glad you like it :^)\r\n\r\n> <em>It kind
    of says, \u201CHey, we\u2019ve been doing this for awhile.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nYep,
    Type at Adobe goes as far back as when the company debuted, which was about 25
    years ago. And there are still people around from those early ages, like [[David
    Lemon]] and [[Robert Slimbach]], who have been working in the Type Department
    for more that 20 years each.\r\n\r\nBTW, [[Thomas Phinney|Thomas]] is celebrating
    his 10th anniversary at Adobe. So please join me in a big round of applause. Congratulations
    Thomas, wish you stay 10 more year, at least!!"
