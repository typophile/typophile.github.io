  \ I use InDesign and was wondering whether I ought to set the kerning to optical
  or metric? What is optical? That is, if I have a high quality font with a painsakingly
  created kerning table, will there be further improvement ot the kerning if I highlight
  a body of text and choose optical? \r\n  Also,`In Robert Bringhurst's 'Elements
  of Typographic Style' he speaks of letterspacing capitals at, say 10%, how much
  is that in the InDesign scale of 10 point increments? Or if that is too opaque a
  way of asking the question, what letterspacing do those who use InDesign tend to
  use for successive capitals and small capitals. I anticipate that the answer is
  something like, \"whatever is most aesthetically pleasing' or something, but I'd
  also appreciate some general suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks alot.\r\n"

    prefer the spacing and kerning of the font. Optical spacing can improve a bit
    for uppercase setting, say, if a font's capitals are spaced to work with lowercase
    but look too narrow and uneven in uppercase setting. But this really depends on
    the typefaces you use, some are very well spaced and kerned even for uppercase
    setting. There was an entire thread with samples about InDesign's optical spacing
    on Typophile, but I cannot find it.\r\n10% of what? :) A suggestion by Jan Tschichold
    was, space the uppercase as much as is needed to make sure that the \"O\" doesn't
    create a hole in the text image. This is also implicit in the initial steps of
    David Kindersley's uppercase spacing method (though I was told that he cared for
    evenness of spacing rather than the amount of spacing). But I consider it anything
    but helpful to suggest % or InDesign units as these would vary from typeface to
    typeface.\r\n\r\nKarsten"
