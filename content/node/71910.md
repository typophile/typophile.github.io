  to a font.\r\nNow, I'm working with the 'frac'...fractions.\r\nEverything goes OK,
  when I create a tag that contains a frac-ligature as the target:\r\n\r\nfeature
  frac { # Fractions\r\n # Latin\r\n     sub seven slash eight by seveneighths;  \r\n}
  frac;\r\n\r\nBut I also want to convert things like this: 213/71879 ...and so.\r\n\r\nHow
  do I do? Thanks in advance for your kind help!\r\nMorten"
