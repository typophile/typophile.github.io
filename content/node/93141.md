    on a couple of foundry websites (at <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com\">Typotheque</a>,
    for one), but to my mind, H&FJ\u2019s is particularly unhelpful. You can\u2019t
    change the size of the letters and you get all the samples on a lined background,
    which makes it nearly impossible to judge the glyphs especially of light cuts.
    And when you want to include characters as exotic as \u2018\xE9\u2019, these will
    be replaced by a question mark. Apparently, their clientele does not need a more
    sophisticated sample setting system."

  body: "I used to say this all the time, and this is a chance to bring it up again:
    any type tester that adds a disruptive pattern to the rendering is unnecessarily
    paranoid. In fact letting people swipe screengrabs is more beneficial than harmful:
    it creates a dependency that can translate into a sale of the actual font. And
    really, you can't convince people to buy your fonts by not letting them abuse
    the tester - they'll just move on to another font house.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Well, H&FJ apparently have enough customers who don\u2019t move on to other
      foundries, the type tester notwithstanding. Still, I don\u2019t understand the
      approach of neither offering PDF samples nor providing the potential customer
      with a proper instrument to try out the fonts. Why would you want your own typefaces
      to look bad and incomplete, as they do in a type tester with a patterned background
      and not even complete ASCII support? In any case: I agree with you, Hrant, that
      type testers like this will rather frighten off genuine customers than prevent
      unlicensed font use (or whatever they are supposed to prevent)."

  body: "What is \"enough customers\"? I think H&FJ do a lot of things well, some
    things exceptionally well - but I also think they are protectionist to the point
    of harming themselves. Note that this is a foundry that used to be accused of
    being way too sue-happy; fortunately they changed. Hopefully their type-tester/PDF
    attitude will too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don\u2019t know what \u2018enough customers\u2019 would be for H&FJ. But:
    I am not surprised that they stick with existing solutions if they are satisfied
    with the way their business is going. I as a potential customer have always been
    put off by the fact that I couldn\u2019t get a detailed sample of their typefaces
    on their website. They probably can send you a PDF, but I don\u2019t like having
    to ask for that. However: Not offering PDFs for download, like deciding to not
    implement a better type tester, seems to be a deliberate choice to attract certain
    customers (who don\u2019t need this or who want to get in touch with them anyway).
    Do you agree?"

  body: "But their prices don't correlate with the \"elitist\" attitude of the tester.
    TEFF for example gives out PDFs that are 600dpi images, and all they have in the
    way of a tester is large horizontal GIFs! But that matches their stratospheric
    pricing: their products are things you need to spend time getting intimately familiar
    with before putting down the money.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    prevent cheapskates from using them as free headline generators\u2014\xE0 la PLINC\u2014for
    web projects, or\u2014if the cheapskates are also disinterested in the quality
    of the finished project\u2014for print projects as well.\r\n\r\nMy long experience
    with offering freebies tells me two things: a) determined thieves will have their
    way, regardless of any precautions you may take to thwart them; and b) it is highly
    unlikely that you will ever turn inveterate cheapskates into paying customers."
