  mags:)! Amongst the stack are some groovtastic Computer Arts Project mags, one of
  which is CA's 100th birthday issue. The issue celebrates iconic pieces of graphic
  design. And there it was - an unwittingly cold cruel typo...\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milton_gi_aser_5809.png]\r\n\r\n...and
  in Milton's own stencil font too :( \r\n\r\nEither that, or there really is an iconic
  graphic designer named MILTON GI ASER."

    things happen, and they happen to me often enough; it's very, very embarrassing
    when you find out...

    with 'overprint ON'. Why Illustrator cannot sort this, Indesign can switch off
    overprint when white selected, why not Illustrator.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    happens even to the best ones!\r\n\r\nThanks for the hint for previewing in illustrator...
    I'm still trying to switch form freehand!"

  body: "Nice tip Paul. Fortunately I've only had one minor blunder so far, I misspelled
    'National' in the title of an announcement. The evil thing was seen only for a
    short while before being yanked and corrected long before going to press. I didn't
    know there were two 'a's in national - but I do now! \r\n\r\n"
