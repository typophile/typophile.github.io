body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nWe are looking at building a WYSIWYG version of the font menu that
  appears in our application and we would like to follow a similar style to Indesign
  (i.e.: draw some sample text using each font rather than drawing the font name using
  each font).\r\n\r\nAt the moment the only technical hurdle we have is determining
  which sample text translation to use. To do this we need to determine the main /
  dominant language of that font. For example, Baghdad would be Arabic, Hiragino Sans
  GB would be Simplified Chinese and Hiragino Kaku would be Japanese.\r\n\r\nI assume
  Indesign is using some an algorithm to determine the language rather than a long
  list of known fonts / languages but the question is how does it do it?\r\n\r\nWe
  already have an algorithm in our application that can determine all of the scripts
  used in a font by checking for glyphs in different Unicode ranges but this can't
  tell us what the main language is. I have also looked at the code page information
  for various fonts but even when the data is correct it normally lists multiple code
  pages so that doesn't help either.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any ideas on this?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nKev."

  body: "I worked with the engineer who developed the algorithm used by InDesign (it
    is in the CoolType module), and helped determine priorities. Originally the algorithm
    was used just to subdivide the menu into distinct sections.\r\n\r\nShowing sample
    text in a language is tricky because fonts support writing systems rather than
    languages. So a typical font supports at least a couple of dozen languages. Which
    one will you pick, and why?\r\n\r\nI thought it was a dubious exercise at the
    time, and I still believe that. But basically you can use one of several approaches:\r\n\r\n1)
    Strict priority. Use a prioritized list of writing systems, and as soon as you
    hit a writing system that the font supports, use that. So you might decide that
    your order is Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Cyrillic, Greek. If a font
    supports Chinese and some other languages, you'll show sample text in Chinese.\r\n\r\n2)
    Have some specific rules about combinations, and then fall back to priority.\r\n\r\n3)
    Have priority, but then afterwards, for some results, modify based on other rules.
    For example, let's say you come back with \"Latin\" as the writing system you
    want to display, but your rule is that if (1) the writing system found by priority
    is Latin, Greek or Cyrillic, AND (2) the user's system language is in one of the
    Latin, Cyrillic or Greek sets, AND (2) the user's system language is supported
    by the font, THEN show a string in that specific language.\r\n\r\nYou might also
    want the user to be able to set a language or enter a string for display."

  body: "Agreeing with Thomas Phinney. InDesign's system is not flawless:  Symbol,
    Wingdings, and Zapf Dingbats appear in the 'default' section, and huge fonts such
    as Arial MS Unicode appear (from memory) in the Chinese section.\r\n\r\nIn general,
    ID seems to look at the Unicode ranges a font says it contains. Experimenting
    with these may reveal its actual algorithm --  chances are it's as simple as \"first
    come, first serve\", for a reasonable coverage of glyphs for a certain script.\r\n\r\nIt's
    pretty useless to try and match glyph coverage to languages. If a font contains
    accented characters but not the letter 'k', would you infer it's intended to be
    used for Italian only? (Which only uses 'k' in loan words.)"

  body: "Hello Thomas & Theunis.\r\n\r\nThanks for your replies, they were extremely
    helpful.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about this more myself I had came to a similar
    conclusion that the solution would involve some prioritised list of writing systems.
    I think the prioritisation might also have to be based on the language that the
    user has set their operating system to.\r\n\r\nOur application already attempts
    to determine the scripts available in a font via Unicode glyph ranges so this
    could be used to determine major writing systems such as: Japanese, Korean, Thai,
    Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Roman and Devanagari. We also need to handle Chinese but
    trying to split Simplified and Traditional will need more investigation.\r\n\r\nOnce
    we know the writing system I guess we need to determine what localised text to
    display. For the languages we support in our application we would have translations
    for the sample text. For Roman scripts we would choose the text based on the operating
    system language with a fallback to English. For other writing systems we could
    choose the sample text based on the font writing system we determined or the operating
    system language. I guess some experimentation (and possibly user configuration)
    would be required here. \r\n\r\nI know none of this is perfect but in the situation
    where we need to implement a WYSIWYG font menu I think this should produce a much
    better menu compared to just trying to display the font name using the font.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKev."
