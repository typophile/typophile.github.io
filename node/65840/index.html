<p>My first DECISION is that in Mike Hebrew font, the Latin should be subordinate to the Hebrew. Actually I thought this all along&hellip; but maybe not in words.</p>
<p>How should this effect the design of the Latin characters? Again it would be helpful to have explicitly formulated ideas on this. Much of it up to now has been intuitive.</p>

<p>How should this effect the design of the Latin characters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I see it a subordinate font can sacrifice quite a bit of cultural authenticity - but only with the purpose of better serving the master design. So for example Patria&rsquo;s Armenian subordinate has full serifs (which the Armenian script really doesn&rsquo;t like). Another example is the Latin &ldquo;g&rdquo; below from a grot Cyrillic-dominant typeface I was commissioned to design last year. It&rsquo;s made to echo the form of the Cyrillic &ldquo;б&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/cyrlat_g_4412.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>For serving a traditional Hebrew type I might recommend a subordinate Latin where the stroke contrast is flipped (thicker horizontals than verticals*) but Mike Hebrew is monoline (which you could say makes things easier). Another central parameter is vertical proportions: Latin likes to have an x-height within a certain range, but to avoid a subordinate that looks too large/small in comparison to the master script you can move quite a distance away from that range; in the case of Hebrew that probably means a Latin with quite a large x-height (which you seem to be shooting for already).</p>
<ul>
<li>See the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>William, depreciating the baseline is quite a fascinating idea.</p>

<p>depreciating the baseline</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ada Yardeni in Hebrew Script points out that traditionally Hebrew is &ldquo;hung&rdquo; from the top, with the baseline not so strong. The baseline was made stronger in Ashkenazi scripts, perhaps under the influence of Latin scripts.</p>
<p>Mike Hebrew takes advantage of the fact you can play with the baseline in Hebrew without penalty&ndash;except for making nikud more difficult to place.</p>
<p>Playful designs like [[http://www.p22.com/ihof/peanut.html|Peanut]] (that link should work, the above does not) are able to get away with an irregular baseline in latin. I don&rsquo;t understand how exactly they are able to pull it off, but you might ask typophiler Michael Clark, who designed Peanut, about the challenge.</p>
<p>Because of the informal mono-line, I think potentially the latin can be very strong also, and still harmonize. This would be a real achievement, I think&ndash;to have a latin and hebrew that really work together seamlessly. If it were me, I&rsquo;d start by mirroring your kaf and using that as a c, and building the look on that. As it is, the very round sans you have doesn&rsquo;t work at all, IMHO.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a lot of test documents in Hebrew with some English text.<br>
My first goal was to balance the size and boldness of the English so that it
was unobtrusive - usually acheived by having the Latin characters a little
larger and a lighter. The overall effect should be for the Hebrew to stand
out on the page even when an English translation with more words will
occupy more space</p>
<p>In no way did I want the Latin characters to look like Hebrew ones.  I avoid
giving the shape of a Hebrew character to a Latin character.  My approach
was to make a small change in the Latin and then review all my test documents
to see if there was an improvent.  For instance, the first change was to tilt the
center bar of the lower case &ldquo;e&rdquo;.  The change was carried out across the 
six members of the font family. I was amazed that an improvement could be
seen in the appearance of whole pages after such a small change!</p>
<p>The table below shows which Latin characters were changed. 
Further changes suggest themselves but will they improve appearance and not
diminish readability?

There may be valuable possiblities in the approach you suggest. Certainly in brief bilingual presentation such as product name or title page, a closely related visual
style would be attractive. However I&rsquo;m thinking of my Latin as being a practical
workhorse to get the Latin out with minimal baggage. The user doesn&rsquo;t have to LIKE the
design - ideally it should not even be noticed.</p>
<p>William,
The very narrow roman characters are of value in displaying translated text where the
English is so much more wordy and the Hebrew so very brief. 
If you look again at my first post, I think you might agree that the English text in
the example blends in well with the Hebrew&hellip; or maybe it doesn&rsquo;t. What do you think?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David Hamuel,</p>
<p>So if I have a display font and&hellip;
we accept that:
<em>Display fonts developed as advertising types, and are intended for limited use
at larger sizes, to catch readers' attention. Their readability is not their prime
function, and should not be used for the longer passages of text.</em></p>
<p>Should I design a matching display font for my Latin characters?
I is a big undertaking and as software engineers like to say it is &lsquo;scheduled
for a future release&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After thinking about the posts and looking at the other fonts suggested, my current
Latin set looks less and less attractive. However assuming I will release 
Mike Hebrew v33 quite soon, I wonder what changes should I make to the Latin
characters I have right now.

<p>In fact, I was trying to show how my font treats similar shapes, e. g. [teth mem pe a e g], but couldn&rsquo;t upload my image file. Anyway, you get the idea, and if you go to the trouble of downloading HebRoni you will see how (in this case) the same basic shape does duty for six glyphs.</p>
<p>&hellip; and I am curious to see the next version of Mike Hebrew!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, I think David, who is a native speaker and designer of excellent Hebrew types, is right on the mark. Your Mike Hebrew already is a display font, as it won&rsquo;t work for extended text. So a matching latin that is much more strongly &lsquo;flavored&rsquo; is a more appropriate match.</div>
