body: "Hello, i have a bit strange question,\r\nim in Amsterdam and one of the reasons
  for coming here was to check second hand book store for typography and design literature.
  i learned about it from the book called Thinking with type from Ellen Lupton, theres
  a picture of bill from this shop, where author bought some books. its in the part
  where she talks about pixel fonts.\r\nim sure a lot of people here owns these book,
  so i would be very grateful if anyone checks this picture and writes the address
  of this shop from that bill picture.\r\nalso, i would be happy to learn about any
  other bookstores worth of visit in amsterdam, connected with type, or any gallery
  etc.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot,\r\nondrej"
