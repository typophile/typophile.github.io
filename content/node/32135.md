  body: "Sure it's possible. You can select glyphs in the glyph window and choose
    \"new metrics window\" and have it populated that way. You can also type glyph
    names, each preceded by a slash, in the text entry part of the metrics window.
    I think you can load and save files of sample strings, too, but I haven't gotten
    into that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Yes, I know this, but lets say you have a sample text which you load. A regular
    text. Let\u2019s say you want to see this text when kerning the OT-small caps:\r\n\r\na
    cat walked in the room\r\n\r\nIf you want to kern the small caps, the sample text
    must look like this:\r\n\r\n/a.small/space/c.small/a.small/t.small/space/w.small/a.small/l.small/
    etc\r\n\r\nNot so handy ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was, that if I could just load
    my \"a cat walked\" text and then click on small caps in the metrics window. Wow,
    that would save hours a day.\r\nThe sample strings I load is rather long."

  body: "There is more than one way to skin a cat :)\r\n\r\nAnother way is to load
    your small caps into a new font in the normal abc or ABC position, and space or
    kern them there. Then you can easily type different test strings at will. When
    you are done, you can copy and and 'paste special' back into your font.  \r\n\r\nIf
    you are using the same test strings, just load whatever you do into the test strings--use
    the button with the three dots at the top right--and then they are available for
    reuse. "

  body: "William, that seems like a good workaround. Thanks. :)\r\n\r\nBut to be honest,
    this is the first time I really got \"angry\" on FontLab, because I really think
    it _should_ be possible to do this in the metrics window in the font you are working
    on. Without workarounds.\r\n\r\nWell, you can\u2018t always get what you want,
    but let\u2019s hope Adam reads this thread, because it feels like a necessary
    update in future versions of FontLab. A metrics panel WITH OT-features would rock!"

    of typing the strings over and over in the metrics window, I just type them once
    with the slash-glyphname format and save them as text. The metrics window has
    a folder button which allows you to navigate to any text file on your machine
    and open it in the Metrics Window. This really comes in handy for setting metrics

  body: I concur, it would really be of help. Another fine addition would be for Fontlab's
    metrics window to be able to load a unicode text file, and then automatically
    convert the unicode characters into the special Fontlab format e.g. /oslash

  body: Seems to me the problem is that not everyone tags their small caps the same
    way (eg. Asmall or A.sc, etc.), thus, FontLab wouldn't know which glyphs to place
    in the metrics/kerning window when you hit a "small caps" button.

    if they wanted to.  "

    are named Asmall, asmall, a.small or a.sc. It\u2019s all about how the classes

  body: "Good point Goran; so the Metrics window would need to be able to call up
    and apply OT classes to preview text. That would be handy.\r\n\r\nEven better
    would be an option to highlight text in the preview and apply OT features to specific
    bits of the string. That way you could type (for example) \"ABC1/3ff\" and apply
    c2sc to \"ABC,\" apply frac to \"1/3\" and apply liga to \"ff\" and then work
    on the kerning/metrics for mixed combinations."

  body: "I agree that a unified metrics/OT panel would be *very* handy. It would certainly
    save me considerable time.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of tricks one learns, though.
    For instance, when in the text-editing mode in the metrics window one can cut
    and paste glyphs. Also, one can simply drag glyphs into the metrics window. It
    is amazing how quick one gets at some of these routes for doing things like spelling
    words in small caps. But it really is just a workaround.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "BTW, note that in FontLab Studio 5.0.2 (not in previous versions), at the
    very bottom of the the OpenType Preview panel, there is a small text field that
    allows you to capture the final glyphnames after applying some OpenType features.
    So you can type in \"adhesion\", apply \"smcp\" and in the bottom textfield \"/a.sc/d.sc/h.sc/e.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc\"
    (or something like that) will appear. You can copy that text and paste it into
    the small textfield in the Metrics Window. This is a slightly handier way of doing
    this. Still not optimal, but better than typing the glyphnames. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: One thing that disturbs my flow in this area is the apparent inability of
    FL to open a metrics window, or allow one to paste text strings that contain more
    than 256 (?) characters, even though its not a lot glyphs. if , e.g. you have
    glyphs with long names, you're limited to how many you can see, which seems like
    a kind of cheap way of saving some tiny slice of memory... don't it?
