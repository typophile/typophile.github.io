  body: "Hi Kiko,\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if padding (always having three digits)
    is an option. Don\u2019t think so.\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s a quite simple workaround:
    create 3 master pages (can be cascading).\r\nThe first has \u201800+<em>A</em>\u2019
    as page number and gets applied to pages 1\u20139. The second has  \u20180+<em>A</em>\u2019
    and is for pages 10\u201399. And the third has the plain \u2018<em>A</em>\u2019,
    for pages 100\u2013999.\r\n\r\nThe leading zeros are \u2018hard-coded\u2019, <em>A</em>
    stands for the automatically inserted page number.\r\nF"

    page number for pages 1-9, then 0+current page number for pages 10-99. Can't think
    of a cleverer way around it, even though there might be one.\r\n\r\nEdit: Florian

  body: "Put a Section Marker on the first page, then go to Numbering & Sections options
    and set the section prefix to OO. If you want the pages to number 001, 002, .
    . . 010, 011, . . . etc ,you will have to start a new section for each. One for
    001-009, another for 010-099, another for 100+, otherwise the 00 will continue
    through the document. The section numbering is done in the document, not the master
    pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a
