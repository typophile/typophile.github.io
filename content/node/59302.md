body: "I see this font on 70's Sci-Fi paperbacks all the time. It's mostly used in
  all caps, but it also appears in U&LC in the logo for \"Easyriders\" magazine. It
  has a vaguely art nouveau look, but also a lot of 70's counter-culture connections.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a link to an example:\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kRm2JG596XA/R8XikknGoDI/AAAAAAAAASs/BLYvQvPnWFA/s400/Sailor+on+the+seas+of+fate+cover+3.JPG\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone tell me the font name, and if there is a downloadable freeware or shareware
  version? Thanks.\r\n\r\n- Rich"
