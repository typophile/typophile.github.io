  attributes are things like choice, comfort, movement, urban, quality, vibrance,

  body: "I like the second one except the \"COFFEE COMPANY\" needs to align on the
    left with the vertical stem of the /H. Then take a look at the right alignment
    of the line and move the last word to align with the right side of the /e.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can figure out a way to better space the \"Hiline\" to fix the erratic character
    spacing, that would be a big help too."
