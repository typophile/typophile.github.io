body: "\u201CHFS\u201D (working name) is a friendly sans serif with plenty of character.
  I am planning seven weights.\r\n\r\nI've been working off and on this font for a
  while. It has begun to take on some similarity to antique olive in the heavier weights,
  but that does not carry through to the family. \r\n\r\nThe extreme mass of the black
  has created a problem creating the intermediate instances of the multiple master.
  I am planning to to split the current multiple master somewhere around the medium
  range. One for light through medium and then another for bold to black to make two
  masters for this font to correct some of the weight issues in the medium-regular-
  light range. At least, that is the conclusion I've come to you so far. If somebody
  knows a better way has to deal with these intermediate weight issues, please let
  me know. I'd be very grateful. It would be nice if fontlab would allow for an intermediate
  master character to correct these issues. I suppose there are some options in the
  robofab world, but I cant make that jump.\r\n\r\nIn addition I have the question
  of whether or not I should make this a rounded family or keep it as is. I think
  rounded might work better with the concept of \u201Cfriendliness\u201D, but that
  might be something that I need to add later in an extension to the family.\r\n\r\nThe
  font does not yet have kerning and spacing issues have not been completely resolved
  yet either. I have only got the forms down to close to what I want them.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know your thoughts on the design thus far. I welcome all comments.\r\n\r\nI
  guess the image upload is broken, so here is a link to a .pdf.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/HFS1.pdf]]"

  body: If you are planning 7 weights, may I suggest to try to find a place for the
    8th. That way you can style link 4 pairs for regular and bold.

  body: Looks gorgeous to me! The 'c' in the regular weight seems slightly too dark
    at the top though.
