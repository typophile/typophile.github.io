    or a knockoff thereof.

  body: I don't think this is a font as the Bata logo looks like this since the pre-digital
    era (1920s/30s or even earlier). Unless they had one made in the meantime that
    is, but that would be most probably exclusive to them.

  body: Forgot to add that Bata is a shoe company running since the end of the 19th
    century i think.

  body: Yeah, you're right. But Eclat is a good start, definitly. Thanks guys.
