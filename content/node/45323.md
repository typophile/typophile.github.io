  body: "Base,\r\n\r\nI would let the both \"T\" go together and form a \"ligature\".
    Too much space between them both as it is now. Another option would be to shorten
    the inner part of both \"T\" if you want the letters to be separated. Tighten
    about 25-30%. Secondly I would also tighten up the kerning on the pay-off about
    20-30% and som extra on the space between \"brand\" and value. It might just be
    the picture, but to me the vertical stroke seems too thin to my eyes. Good luck."

  body: "Base,\r\n\r\nYou're welcome! I usually edit the letters when doing logo work.
    That way the end result becomes more unique, rather than just\r\nhaving the normal
    letters side by side...\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: you need to upload RGB JPGs on the web. CMYK won't render in a lot of browsers.
