  printing is a printing process that consists of pulling [[ink]] through a cloth
  screen.\r\n\r\n<em>Screen printing materials: </em>\r\n\r\nThe <em>screen</em> consists
  of a piece of silk, nylon or polyester stretched taut over a wood or aluminum frame.\r\nThe
  <em>mask</em> is a piece of plastic or chemical filler on the screen that won't
  allow the ink to pass through parts of the screen.\r\nThe <em>ink</em> is usually
  a thick oil based ink.\r\nThe <em>squeegee</em> is a large piece of rubber with
  a handle that is the width of the screen.\r\n\r\n<em>Printing process</em>\r\n\r\nIn
  order to print, the screen must be covered by a mask. The ink is placed on the screen,
  and pulled evenly across by the squeegee. The ink is pushed through the fine mesh
  of the screen, but not through the mask, leaving an image on the surface below.
  The screen may be masked by a piece of plastic stencil, placed on top of the fabric.
  More commonly, however, the mask is created by a chemical filler that won't allow
  the ink to pass through. The filler may either be painted on by hand, or created
  with a light sensitive emulsion."
