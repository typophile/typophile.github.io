body: "Imagine that you are the Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee and just resigned after
  twenty years of holding that office. There is considerable speculation that you
  resigned due to an FBI investigation that has been underway by a federal grand jury
  for months related to your openly corrupt administration. You receive a letter from
  the FBI informing you that you are the target of this investigation. That letter
  essentially means that a federal felony indictment will soon be on its way. Due
  to the seriousness of this information, you want to reply directly to Eric Holder,
  the Attorney General of the United States of America. What typeface do you select
  for your personal heading?\r\n\r\n[[http://files.wmctv.com/2009/herentonholder.pdf|http://files.wmctv.com/2009/herentonholder.pdf]]\r\n\r\nI
  only hope that this isn\u2019t the actual typesetting of the letter and is just
  a PDF created by someone from the news station with a sense of humor.\r\n"
