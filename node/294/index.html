		<div class="commentbody">The logical rule would be to never break the symbol from the item for which it is the trademark.

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is incorrect to separate the &#153; from the  <BR>Acme with a period intervening. No matter what. The  <BR>implication in your approach &#40;both 1 and 3 in your  <BR>example&#41; is that the entire sentence &#40;or at least the  <BR>clause &#34;call Acme&#34;&#41; is the trademark. <BR> <BR>I would set the sentence order as Acme&#153;., then  <BR>kern the period under the &#153;, but not so far as  <BR>your #3 example. This way, also, your text is not  <BR>&#34;broken&#34; when repurposed into an environment  <BR>without kerning. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s my opinion as a designer, typographer, and editor. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Crazy dedicated typographers do the  <BR>same with quotes over periods.</i> <BR> <BR>Crazy dedicated typographers who use well crafted  <BR>fonts shouldn&#39;t have to, as the quote-period kern pair  <BR>should be present in a good font. I also include kerns  <BR>for period-quote in my fonts. I have not, however,  <BR>heretofore built a kern pair for trademark-period.  <BR>But perhaps I will include it from here on out. &#40;And,  <BR>I suppose, period-trademark as well, just in case.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am much less concerned with implying that a period or an entire sentence is part of the trademark than I am with that lonely period floating off by itself!  <BR> <BR>In general, I would pull the TM much closer to the word Acme than you have in any of the examples shown, CP. Then I would tuck the period in so that it would match any other e. combination. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m more concerned with the flow of the sentence as it is read. The TM is going to be ignored by the reader, so I try to make it as inconspicuous as possible while still meeting the legal requirements of the corporation. <BR> <BR>JMHO <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

I recognize now that my idea of building this into  <BR>the font is problematic. Such an extreme kern of the  <BR>period under the &#153; will pull the following spaceband  <BR>and subsequent letters up tight. This won&#39;t work.  <BR>&#40;Except maybe with an OT contextual table or something.&#41; <BR> <BR>I must admit that from a practical standpoint, setting  <BR>the period first is more effective.
