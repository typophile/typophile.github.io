body: "I have just had a small bit of text printed in Proxima Nova (light), and I
  have noticed that the weight of some letters look bolder than others  (noticeably
  the numbers, capital letters and v, w and y).  \r\n\r\nI cant figure out if this
  is a font problem or a printing problem. \r\nIt seems strange to be a printing problem,
  as it is consistently the capitals that look off \r\nBut also strange that the font
  always looks fine on screen.  \r\n\r\nI do understand that its meant to be a web
  font but I still wouldn't expect these results when printing.\r\nShould I just not
  be using this font for print?  \r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance, I'm very
  new to this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot

    You need to use the desktop font for print."

      not entirely sure what version I need to be looking for for the desktop font.
      \ the version I have is the .otf file if this helps. \r\n\r\nThanks for your
      help, sorry for being a complete noob.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Which app and printer are you using? I assume that was just a desktop printer?
    Laser? I have seen problems like this which were simply caused by the printer
    driver. The stroke width in those capital letters and figures IS larger than in
    the lowercase letters. So something in your print process might emphasize this.
    \r\nPlaying with the driver/quality settings could resolve this and it will probably
    not appear when another printer is used or it printed in offset. "
