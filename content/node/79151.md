  of books for our design department (ie reference textbooks), does anyone know any
  books that discuss typography/design and layout/visual styling for children reading.
  For example, anything from the way things should look, colours and textures to the
  correct type size and leading for specific age groups. \r\n\r\nThanks"

    from Caldecott and Greenaway to Seuss and Sendak.\r\n\r\nIMO, Seuss is the best
    for integrating page layout, illustration, typography, and spot colour.\r\nAnd
    don't discount the \"comic\" genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Years ago I did some design work for a publisher of children's books. One
    thing they told me was that there isn't a generic \"design for children\" style;
    that it had to be designed for the target age group, gender, demographic, etc.
    \ A design that would appeal to a 6 year old girl might be wildly inappropriate
    for a 12 year old boy.  Teens are particularly sensitive to this and wouldn't
    be caught dead with a book that looks like it was intended for someone younger
    than them.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's obvious but thought I'd mention it."
