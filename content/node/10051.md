body: Hello All -- <BR> <BR>Would anyone be able to point me in the direction of some
  good tutorials for fontlab. I&#39;m most concerned with getting the most out of
  the drawing tools at the moment. I&#39;ve seen the video tutorials on their site,
  and I&#39;m not all that impressed :-s <BR> <BR>It&#39;s greatly appreciated. <BR>

  body: There is Leslie Carbarga&#39;s book, <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/"
    target="_blank">Learn FontLab Fast</a>. <BR> <BR>His <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/"
    target="_blank">Logos, Fonts and Lettering Bible</a> doesn&#39;t discuss FontLab
    much, but I did learn some good things about letter drawing from it &#40;digital
    and other wise&#41;.

  body: They&#39;re reasonably in-depth; Leslie and Adam Twardoch give a good, concise
    explanation of encodings, some good heuristics on how to build up Western fonts,
    and then tell you to study some existing fonts to see how they do it &#40;which
    happens to be the way I work anyway, so that works out well for me&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>As far as &#39;works flawlessly&#39;, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anybody
    who knows how to do that the first time. Cabarga and Twardoch do scatter a lot
    of tips for how to get your fonts to work properly throughout the book, and point
    out a lot of common pitfalls. Fontlab&#39;s still going to be a really complicated
    program, no matter what, but it seems to me &#40;as someone who&#39;s still in
    the evaluation phase&#41; it has 95% of what you need to make your first few families
    inside FontLab.

  body: I meant <i>Learn Fontlab Fast</i> has about 95% of what you need to make fonts
    with Fontlab; there&#39;s inevitably going to be something tricky you&#39;re going
    to have to figure out yourself, ask someone about, or &#40;yikes!&#41; get out
    of the actual Fontlab manual.

  body: Luke, you can order the book directly from Leslie Cabarga. He shipped it to
    me and it took a little to make its way to Italy. <BR>If not for other reasons,
    LFF &#40;Learn Fontlab Fast&#41; has the merit of being the first compact book
    giving the basics in a clear way &#40;i.e. unlike FL own manual&#41;, although
    it will take a lot of trial and error to determine a good naming strategry for
    Opentype Fonts supposed to work smoothly in cross-platform environments. <BR>
    <BR>Personally, I still keep generating bad OTF files from typefaces which I started
    originally to draw in FontStudio or Fontographer and then brought into FL, and
    I have not yet solved this basic problem. <BR> <BR>Since you seem to be interested
    mostly in the drawing environment, let me know which difficulties bugs you most,
    and I&#39;ll try to tell you have I became familiar with it. <BR>Keep in mind
    that, before FL, I came from drawing faces in Fontstudio and I never used Fontographer
    if not for final files.

    is also a very good place to get information about various things in FontLab,
    although it&#39;s not a tutorial as such.  <BR>I made myself few pages of references
    about FontFamily naming and also about preparing fonts drawings in AI to use in
    FontLab. Although it&#39;s not fully ready I am willing to share it if someone
    is interested. &#40;<a href="mailto:sigurarm@islenska.is">sigurarm@islenska.is</a>&#41;
