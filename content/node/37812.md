  body: If you are talking about a vasectomy, then you'll want to milk it for more
    sympathy than it really deserves. Most people don't know it isn't that big of
    a thing. No implied pun intended.

    They insert their tube through an artery in your groin and pass it up to your
    heart to unblock the coronary arteries.\r\nWell, off I go!\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nGreat

  body: "Dear all,\r\nThanks for the kind wishes!\r\nIt has been a trying few weeks.
    I just got out of he hospital an hour ago. I was in three times in the last 2
    weeks. The first time they put a STENT in one of my coronary arteries and sent
    me home 2 days later. 2 days after that I was back in the hospital with chest
    pain. This time, they put 3 more STENTS in different arteries. They sent me home
    2 days later and a day after that, I had serious chest pain again. My wife Ruth
    called the ambulance and back I went. they did another Thallium stress test and
    blood enzymes and found out that I had a very minor heart attack so back I went
    to the Cath lab for a third poke in the groin. This time, they just changed my
    medications. At least now I am home again and looking forward to a hospital free
    week.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
