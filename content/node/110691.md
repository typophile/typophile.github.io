  body: "As for a template, I suggest you check the eps files from Shutterstock and
    other major vendors.\r\nI trust the typophiles will either identify precise fonts
    or suggest good substitutes.\r\nI looked for the script but did not find the exact
    match. But I did like some alternatives that match the sensibility of the message,
    including Alejandro Paul\u2019s Adios Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/adios-script-pro/
    and his Feel Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/feel-script/. I also
    like several of Laura Worthington's scripts http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Laura_Worthington/\r\nDon\r\n"
