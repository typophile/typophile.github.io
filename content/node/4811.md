  to get the logo looking sharp. Besides that I should know these typefaces. The top
  is Franklin Gothic, but what is the bottom? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36104.jpg"

  body: There&#39;s something very fishy about your Franklin Gothic, Tiff... <BR>It
    doesn&#39;t match any version I&#39;ve come up with so far, the  <BR>lc &#34;r&#34;
    doesn&#39;t jibe and the lc &#34;e&#34; is very Akzidenz Grot-esque. <BR>Weird.

  body: The e looked to me like it matches FG No. 2, but I agree the r isn&#39;t quite
    right. Very close, though. Maybe I should recheck that e.
