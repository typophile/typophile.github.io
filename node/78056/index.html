The inscription turned into a single light narrow sans font, below left. From there I developed the masters for a narrow family, eventually ending up with the design on the right, or at least something thereabouts. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lorimer_narrow_3825.png]


Then I decided to expand it into a multi-width family and developed a wider version—the fonts just released. The original narrower version is almost finished, but at some point I decided to break the releases up just to make the thought process manageable.</div>

It’s something I’ve wanted to try for a long time. The software, music, and movie industries have all been using piracy to promote their products for years. And I’ve long suspected that a few popular type foundries are doing it, because it seems odd how many custom magazine fonts end up in the work of Indian college students before the commercial release. I never bothered before because people bought my work anyway. But Lorimer wasn’t selling, and even the free downloads were tapering off, so I decided to try this.

Because if I add any number or combination of fonts to my own web site I’m just one more font designer/vendor giving out free fonts. Thich describes most font designer/vendors today so nobody would even notice. But thousands of people will try out anything that shows up on TPB, which drives tons of traffic to my web site, and hopefully that will translate to sales. If it doesn’t I’ve lost nothing because nobody was buying the Lorimer family to begin with.</div>

Not exactly. See, thousands of people downloaded the font. And nobody bought it, but that's because those weird letters with the diagonal crossbars and such were a stupid idea, and I should have killed them when I gutted some far more prominent idiosyncracies (Lorimer was once a 20-font family that looked like the Merz logo). But I did see a nice uptick in overall font sales. Anyway, Lorimer No. 2, minus all that weird stuff, should go out to beta testers by the end of the week.</div>

The original Lorimer design was too weird to be useful, so I don’t even sell it anymore. It’s a symptom of spending too much time drawing letters alone in an apartment while conversing with dogs. If anything I have learned why so many type designers lean towards conservative and established styles—the moment one goes off on a tangent things can easily spiral out of control into a family of fonts of no practical value. So giving it away was a pointless exercise; like giving away screwdriver handles with no shafts.

But beyond that, I’ve gone back to the belief that free fonts are pointless. If I release free fonts nobody has any way of knowing that I’m not just another college kid posting his class project to the internet. Getting attention with free fonts is no easier than with paid fonts, because just like paid fonts, there’s already too much out there. It works well for guys like Chank and Larabie and Jos Buivenga because they started doing it when few people were and have done it for so long that designers expect good work. Sure there are some other people who have done well with free fonts, like Code Pro, but I think that has more to do with having the right design for the time than the font actually being free.

I also don’t see any point in contributing to the notion that fonts should be free because there’s no sane business proposition for doing so. I’m not Trent Reznor. I can’t give a type family away to millions of people to promote my worldwide stadium tour and then make tens of millions of dollars. And I’m not a free software author. I can’t give a font away and then expect people to hire me to flesh it out with four more weights in two styles with small caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe the unorthodox shapes should have alternatives, so that more conservative designers would consider it. But they shouldn't be ditched for there maybe people wanting that exact shape later.
Also, from my limited experience in selling fonts, it seems like apple's strategy of simplifying the buying options leaves customers less confused.
I'm inclined to think that people who buy personal use will use it for commercial purposes (in good or bad intentions). Having many instances of licensing will make them think twice about buying it in first place rather than getting it by impulse (I keep thinking of pc vs mac decision process). So why not make it simple and maybe more affordable if it makes sense.

I think the pirate bay thing would be great, but your stunt should maybe be pulled in twitter or more spreadable market oriented media. Probably tweeting that you just found this crazy cool font torrent at TPB. This way you'd found a larger audience prone to downloading/retweeting and hopefully buying it).

And I'm with you, that piracy may help boost sales eventually, rather than hurt it. I think we sometimes get so worried about protecting it that we eventually forget to think about ways to market it and how the customers think.</div>

That only works for people who are
buying a brand and not a product.

		<div class="commentbody">I think at that time, people were buying a product, not just a brand, as apple's brand equity was in an all time low and IBM was the main player then. Of course by comparing apple to PC I have brought many other aspects to light one of them being brand. But when apple did it at the time people started buying more Macs compared to macs themselves (aside from other brands).

Anyways, back to fonts, the variables are many. James had a typeface in which he later experienced had no commercial value, tried different things to it etc. All in all, I'd love to know more about these strategies and how people have failed and succeeded with them, and I found James aproach very valid.

On a sidenote, I really liked Lorimer 2, looks great.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, I disagree with your theory that the original Lorimer failed because it was too weird to be useful.
Admittedly, I have designed some way weirder faces that rarely sell—however, I do have a few faces with odd characters that sell well.

In the case of the original Loriner, the oddities are not particularly attractive when viewed individually, and stand out too much from the rest of the glyphs.
The trick is to make them attractive as individual glyphs, and make them feel at home amongst the other glyphs. Then they can become the memorable “trademark” idiosyncracy, like “g” in Baskerville or “g, y, z” in Bree.

While I realize you mentioned that only as a Apple jab, it's an interesting topic. And, in fact, it's true. Apple or otherwise. 

There's a great article on Trader Joe's and how their success is very much about limiting options:

http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/20/news/companies/inside_trader_joes_full_version.fortune/index.htm

"Swapping selection for value turns out not to be much of a tradeoff. Customers may think they want variety, but in reality too many options can lead to shopping paralysis."

Another interesting take is the 'paradox of choice':

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less

Is this related to retail font sales at all? I dunno. I can say that when my non-type friends ping me for type advice, they usually mention "there's just too many options on myfonts...help me narrow it down".

I know of no solution to that problem, nor would I advocate that there be less typefaces or fewer options on Myfonts. 

But it's an interesting topic.
