<p>For how tight you&rsquo;ve spaced the letters in &ldquo;Dave Bailey&rdquo;, the word spacing isn&rsquo;t tight enough. (I do think you&rsquo;ve spaced it too tightly for the typeface.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the em-dashes surrounding your titles.</p>
<p>The three lines that follow need more line-spacing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m might consider make your name smaller and try left-justifying instead of right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the white outline on the back. Or the white box for that matter. Gratuitous maybe? What if you just had the two lines/boxes of color? This would echo the logo and be more subtle.</p>

<p>I was wondering about it being too tight, the glyph designs have unique serif designs and as such I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind if it was ok to overlap them. There was even a slight mod. to the leg of the <em>L</em> for spacing reasons&hellip;I&rsquo;ll rethink my name.</p>
<p>Maybe I should stick to original ideas and stop thinking so much, that&rsquo;s what I did with the mark. The back was originally just the two colors, like you suggested.</p>

<p>..and add that I&rsquo;m not sure your choice of typeface reflects the interesting logo you have designed yourself. I like your logo design and think you could also push the layout a bit further.</p>
<p>As a starting point I like the way the logo sits on the front, however I think you could be a bit more adventurous with the layout of the text, maybe reflect the shape of the logo a bit more&hellip; don&rsquo;t be afraid of leaving white space? Maybe overlap some of the text on top of the logo in the way that the &rsquo;d' and &lsquo;b&rsquo; interact with each other?</p>
<p>The back does&rsquo;nt match the design you have on the front, maybe keep it simple like the front without the text, or an abstract version of the logo?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree. Here I think you might introduce more by making the web addresses and phone number significantly smaller, and putting them lower, so the card is really about who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>My feeling is that this other stuff can be small because the reader is not going to read it, but only use it if and when he or she wants to contact you. I like the logo too. It more easily reads &ldquo;db&rdquo; when small, so you might want it small on the other side somehow.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, my mistake, I was looking at it full screen, which is deceiving. The 9 pt may be ok, but then maybe the other should be bigger&ndash;or perhaps the info just less leading and moved more distant. I don&rsquo;t know the best way but they look a bit too equal to me. On the first one, the back, the competition of the logo with the stripes confuses the eye, so the db isn&rsquo;t so apparant. Again at true size just on the front it is probably fine&hellip;</div>

And, to agree with Belleisle, I don’t see why you cannot or should not interact type with image, you have already defined white areas with the logo, to the left and the counter, and almost aligned the addresses with the x-height.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You are working on an asymmetric balance here. I like the right alignment, but to me your latest is too heavy to the left. To balance the big logo I am guessing you need to push the text to the right and let more white space pull against the logo. You can play with sizes and placements here until it clicks.</p>
<p>For examples of good asymmetric balance see the great stuff of Hokusai, or in typography early Tschichold.</p>
<p>Also the IL in your name is too tight compared to the the rest. I think you might find the text will work better if everything is in a bolder weight, possibly caps smaller, and the caps more widely spaced.</p>
