    not having had no summer vacation. ;^>

  body: I ordered the catalog without any 500 errors. The process went smoothly, although
    it feels a bit weird having to order something at price 0, but I can understand
    not having to re-write the shipping procedure just for the catalogs. Jonathan,
    very good job.

  body: I am really enjoying your new site design and the supporting content on font
    pages. I particularly like the ability to compare fonts from the <em>Test Driver</em>.
    On a related note, I was a bit confused to see the <em>Test Driver</em> popup
    when I clicked on the <em>Characters</em> link. It took me a good moment to realize
    that both features shared the same popup window. Nonetheless, congratulations
    on your Chronicle family and the all new website!

  body: A beautiful redesign for a great foundry. Having said that. I agree with kensoliva
    that the popup Test Driver is confusing. It's also unnecessary, distracting, and
    inaccessible - a real usability mistake. Getty Images has made the same egregioius
    mistake recently and I don't know, for the life of me, why these fine firms would
    resort to 1997 presentation methods.

  body: Fantastic. It looks gorgeous, and I'm loving the look of the navigation bars.
    While it's nice to see a complete list of serifs, I think it'd be better if they
    were broken up into sections to save bandwidth, and not have to wait to have it
    all load. Other than that, the look and feel is excellent.

  body: "Hello Mr. Hoefler. Your new site is very handsome, but I noticed a few things
    which I thought I would share.\r\n\r\n+ On my home computer, a 12\" laptop, the
    navigation bar across the top takes up a large portion of the screen.\r\n+ The
    pop-up Interactive/Specimen Test Driver reminds me of old sites from a few years
    ago. Most sites incorporate the test driver into the main browser window.\r\n+
    The Interactive Test Driver states that, \"Some characters may not be accessible
    from your keyboard,\" which makes it seem like it's somehow my fault. I don't
    understand why characters which are typed using the option key are either missing,
    replaced by a ?, or completely wrong. (I typed \xAE and got \uFB01.)\r\n+ The
    Interactive Test Driver doesn't have kerning.\r\n+ The Characters Test Driver
    in a large font, like Chronicle, is awkward to scroll through. I had to press
    on the arrow key for 10 seconds to see the numbers!\r\n+ The \"Fonts\" pages are
    difficult to browse with, as they show all of the weights of a font. It would
    be more helpful for me to see all of the same-style fonts in the same weight so
    that I can compare them.\r\n+ I like the shopping interface! (See, I can pay a
    compliment!)\r\n\r\nThis is a fine effort! A very smart and serious-looking website
    which puts the Hoefler Foundry back on the top of the type league.\r\n\r\nJN"

    ordered the catalog, I always enjoy seeing type specimen in print.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    somehow I thought that before I could order single weights of Gotham (I need to
    purchase it soon). It seems that there's only packages now? Am I mistaken? Sorry
    for hijacking the thread with such a question. :)\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nAh, I read
    now that single weights is only for +50CPU's.\r\nWhat a shame. Now I'll have to
    find another font to buy.\r\n\r\n<em>this stupid forum bug just kicked my post
    to the bottom</em>"
