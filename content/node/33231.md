  body: Hrant, what do you think of Greta? It seems to have the "obese x-height" you
    often rail against.

  body: "Well there are good and bad reasons to make an x-height obese. In the 70s
    for example many people did it purely for style, in disregard for anything else
    (think ITC Garamond). That sucked. On the other hand the smaller the point size
    the larger the x-height should be - and newspapers are a very prominent and long-standing
    case of small-size typography needing large x-heights.\r\n\r\nGreta's x-height
    I would actually not call \"obese\" btw - I think if you measure it it'll come
    out to about what Times is. Also, width has a compounding effect; Times is narrow
    while ITC Garamond is wide, making the latter than much worse.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for clarifying, Hrant.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Greta, you're comparing
    the x-height to the height of the lowercase ascenders and not the caps, right?
    'Cuz if you look at the words \"Greta Text\" at the top of the sample you linked,
    the cap-to-x-height relationship looks positively Vectora-like."

  body: Yeah, I guess rather than call out Greta's x-height, you could deem its <em>cap
    height</em> diminutive.

  body: "Yes, caps constituting only about 5% of text aren't very relevant here. But
    Greta's sure are super short! Some kind of record*, or close. I personally like
    that, although it does have one drawback: for text that's likely to be <cite>scanned</cite>
    (as a rule for a proper name, hence something capitalized) it's less effective
    than caps that stand out a bit. And it seems to me that the types of settings
    that benefit from fonts with large x-heights also tend to benefit from being easily
    scanned.\r\n\r\n* Vectora's caps are even smaller, but look at the x-height compared
    to the ascenders: gargantuan. I'd say this makes the caps relatively larger than
    Greta's.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
