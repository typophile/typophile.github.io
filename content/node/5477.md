body: I&#39;ve heard and seen both in use, ie ranged left, range left, what would
  be the most common? I guess ranged.

  body: Well, I say that its is RANGE left, not ranged left. Although, I usually say
    &amp; hear &#34;flush left.&#34;

  body: Seems to me that &#39;RANGED left&#39; is a description, while &#39;RANGE
    left&#39; is an instruction. I remember writing &#39;Range left&#39; on typescript
    that was going off to typesetters &#40;metal and, in time, film&#41;, and describing
    the results as &#39;Ranged left&#39;. So in answer to Miles&#39; question, &#39;range&#39;
    may be more common, but &#39;ranged&#39; is probably grammatically correct.

  body: 'The full term would be ranged left, ragged right &#40;for ranged right the
    ragged margin would be the left&#41;, usually shortened to just ranged left &#40;or
    right&#41;. I&#39;ve heard flush left &#40;or right&#41;, ragged right &#40;or
    left&#41; or flush to both margins &#40;justified&#41;. '

    at all. '
