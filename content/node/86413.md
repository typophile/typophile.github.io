  retailer's logo, which seems to have been a custom calligraphy effort done some
  time ago. As you can see from this scan from their business card, it suffers from
  years of reproduction and bleeding. \r\n\r\nI suppose what I'd like to know from
  you knowledgeable folks is what I should be careful with when tidying this up. I'm
  also curious about this style... the 'E' and 'A' are curious, and the 'S' seems
  unusual. Thoughts?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JBElogo001_6472.jpg]"
