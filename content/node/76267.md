body: "Hey fellow typophilians,\r\n\r\nI am currently designing my own typeface, called
  expletus which can be viewed here: http://www.typophile.com/node/72368\r\nI am confident
  with all upper- and lowercase glyphs, except the R. It used to have a straight leg,
  but no matter how I many varaitions I tried, it just always looks out of balance.
  So I decided to make it more like Myriad's R. At first glance I would say, the latest
  version (top) looks best, but I'm not sure if it looks 'clean' enough. What do you
  think? Any comments are welcome, including other critique on expletus-sans. Cheers!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rpict_5544.jpg]"

  body: "How about just making the fancy terminal a straight cut -- at first. \r\nWork
    out the whole glyph set that way (and test it in small text), and <em>then</em>
    apply the extra nuancing (if really necessary).\r\n\r\nThat may seem like a lot
    of work and going backwards, at this point in time, but it would resolve design
    issues by separating letter shape and letter detail, shape being the more fundamental
    and having priority, and be more amenable to adding extra weights.\r\n\r\nDesign
    the process.\r\n\r\n(Many people work this way when producing rounded fonts, by
    producing a \"normal\" sans, and then applying the rounding.)"

  body: Seems like quite a logical idea, but I think I've tried this before some time
    ago, without succes. I'll give it another try, but I think the 'fancy terminal'
    just has too much influence on the curves.

    the width of the widest \r\npart of your curved strokes may be mechanically the
    \r\nsame as the width of the upright strokes?.\r\n\r\nFor optical reasons the
    widest widths of curves should\r\nbe a fraction wider than the vertical width.\r\nBut
    this will be a visual decision and not a mechanical pecentage.\r\n\r\nIeuan Rees"

    now. Myriad only has a very small mathematical difference between stems and curves
    compared to expletus. '
