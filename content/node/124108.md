  Currently I'm working on a project where I need to select 3 sans-serif fonts. First
  one is more general like, that is either very over used or has very basic shapes
  (my choices were Helvetica, Arial Times New Roman) Second one, needs to depict precise
  and clear information (science publications) (my choices were Akkurat, Din, Replica)
  And third one is mostly used for philosophical, art statements (like for example
  Laurence Wiener works) (Trade Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Knockout) I'm open for any
  other suggestions or corrections. And thank you very much in advance."

    is a <em>serif</em> one.
