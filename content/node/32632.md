  body: "Okay, this is going to sound kind of weird... It's Baker Danmark 5 with an
    upside down cap E. \r\n\r\nWhy would it have an upside down E? One possible explanation:
    Back in the film font days, piracy was a big problem (some things never change).
    One of the tricks the producers of film fonts did was to flip or rotate one of
    the letters in the film font print they sent out to a customer they suspected
    of pirating their fonts. If the font with the flipped letter showed up elsewhere,
    they had their proof. Typical letters that were flipped or rotated were N, E,
    and U. I have seen many knock-off fonts in old film font catalogs with \"wrong\"
    characters like this.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is that the E was flipped purposely
    by the designer, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any digital version of
    the Baker Danmark series, so I'm guessing this is from something printed at least
    a decade or two ago."

  body: I don't know. There was just something Baker-ish looking about it. The E threw
    me off at first. Thought it might be some kind of Weiss thing. But then I looked
    up Baker Danmark and everything else fit exactly.

  body: that really was something -- and a bit of type trivia i hadn't heard before...
    it seems odd that that type designers would lay a trap of that sort; but they
    didn't have cable tv or internet back then, so people were probably looking for
    ways to wile away the time.

  body: Supposedly, map publishers like Rand McNally did (maybe still do) a similar
    thing. They would make little "mistakes" here and there on their maps. Maybe a
    small creek would zig instead of zag. If the same mistake showed up on another
    publisher's map, they would use this as evidence of copyright infringement and
    take them to court.

  body: "i do much the same thing in that i tie my all-stars with the left-hand overlap
    instead of the right. you'd be amazed at the shocked faces when i catch the ape-ers.\r\n\r\nseriously,
    i had no idea that type designers (of chartographers) did that sort of thing.
    but i shouldn't be surprised; chicanery was goudy's middle name. or manutius.
    i'm checking..."
