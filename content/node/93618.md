  what font a site may be using, when they embed their font using the Cufon Javascript
  Library? \r\n\r\nHope so, this would help a lot. \r\n\r\nTake care folks."

  body: "Aha, I guess I should of looked a little harder I skipped right over it in
    the site I was referring to. \r\n\r\nI was trying to find out what font is used
    on smartclient.com\r\nAn AJAX JS Framework from Isomorphic Software. \r\n\r\nTurns
    out they are using Collaborate by Ralph Oliver du Carrois.\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Colaborate\r\n\r\nI
    think that is all they are using, looks right for everything. Including their
    logo.  Agree? \r\n\r\nBut I am really curious about sites that do rename their
    fonts. I wonder if there is a way to tell then?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut thanks again, riccard0,
    been a good help buddy. "

  body: "It's easy to rename font <em>files</em>, but renaming the font itself is
    (a) more work, and (b) usually forbidden. Do web font loaders refer to file names
    or to font names? What about CSS font-family?\r\n\r\n(After using Safari's Web
    Inspector) ... Aaah. The example you gave does <em>not</em> use one of the \"regular\"
    web font formats (WOFF, EOT, WHYG). Instead the entire font is loaded in JSON
    vector format and gets drawn by some Javascript called \"Cufon\":\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rather
    than Flash, it uses a mixture of canvas and VML to render the fonts.\r\n(<a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/the-easiest-way-to-use-any-font-you-wish/\">The
    Easiest Way to Use Any Font You Wish</a></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn that case it's
    merely a change in the JSON to \"hide\" the original font name. Well, per its
    EULA it should still be carrying the original copyright declaration..."

    body: "Yeah the cufon is a bit curious. A LOT of Web Designers/Developers use
      it regularly.  \r\nMany seem to claim it as being the most superior method of
      embedding fonts, even the most experienced of designers, but really I disagree
      with them.. Its just like Image embedding.. You cant really select the font...
      It selects as an image basically. Many like it because it will render in any
      and all browsers, but what I think they dont take into account is not everyone
      has JS enabled in their browser, as it is a security risk at times. \r\n\r\nBUT
      you can see what they embedded on their webpage by looking in the <head> section
      of their HTML. They embed the Javascript in the head in a format like this:
      \r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/cufon-yui.js\"></script>\r\n<script
      type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/ColaborateLight_400.font.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nSo
      the first Cufon script is Cufon.js itself, and the second is the font. once
      that is embedded in the head, it can be used throughout the page using another
      cufon <script> tag. \r\n\r\nBut the thing is, when you upload a font to cufon,
      you get to choose the name of that .js file, that renders the font. So really
      you could name it anything. \r\nYou are even allowed to name commercially paid
      fonts anything you want, because you are not altering the font file, but the
      way you are allowed to do so, is when you are on the website converting your
      licensed font file, you must check the box allowing the font to only be used
      on a specified website domain.  Leaving you in your legal bounds of the licensing.
      (As long as its a license that allows embedding other than PDF's of coarse)
      \r\n\r\nSo if someone was to name a font some completely random name, (Which
      they do) It would make it nearly impossible to identify it, it would seem. Other
      than looking back at resources, or uploading to WhatTheFont, or WhatFontIs,
      etc. Making things quite complicated.. \r\n\r\nWhich is why I made this thread,
      in hopes of some tool, or method of finding out from the cufon script source
      or something.  Idk I guess ill keep looking into it! ;)\r\n\r\nBy the way, Theunis
      de Jong, What is this \"WHYG\" Format that you speak of? \r\n\r\n"

    not a brand new way to express an indefinite list in spoken English.
