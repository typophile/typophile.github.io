  think the cap J is one the faces as well, if not, does anyone know what that is
  also?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0911_3465.png]\r\n

  body: The "Lorem ipsum" text is some version of Garamond. Hard to say exactly which
    at such low resolution, but my guess would be <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/garamond/">Monotype
    Garamond.</a>
