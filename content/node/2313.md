body: Hello everyone, this is my first post of Typophile!  <BR> <BR>Ignaz Textura&#39;s
  forms, pictured below, are based off letters that I found on a sepulchral memorial
  outside of St. Ignaz church in Mainz &#40;Germany&#41;.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21834.gif"
  alt="Inaz Textura?first sample"> <BR> <BR>The memorial dates from the mid-16th century.
  The original letters seem to be similar to a textura, but being carved into stone,
  are quite different from contemporary printed, or written blackletters. I hope that
  I&#39;ve been able to capture some of this in my drawings.  <BR> <BR>This typeface
  is still in its early stages, and I&#39;d really love to hear what ever people think
  about it.

  body: Very concrete. <BR> <BR>The most interesting letter to me was the &#34;e&#34;
    with the little hookling. Was it also carved, or did you add it yourself? Does
    this shape match the meaning of what was written on the memorial? <BR>

  body: All three of the e&#39;s are based off of the actual stone carving, so I didn&#39;t
    &#34;invent&#34; the hookling myself &#40;unfortunately!&#41;. It is possible
    that the unattached hookling on the second e may have actually been attached once;
    the inscription is on red sand stone, which is very soft. Most of the letters
    are now quite corroded, and some are illegible to me. <BR> <BR>The letters are
    from a c.A3-sized inscription on an outdoor sepulcher. Over the seplcher is a
    larger-than-life, multi-figured sculpture group, depicting the crucifixion &#40;boy,
    that&#39;s a mouthful&#41;. The inscription is in German, which seems abnormal
    for the ecclesatic art of the time, which at least in Catholic Germany was usually
    done in Latin. However, I don&#39;t think that the inscribed text has any deep,
    inner meaning. I think that its more of your average variety of gravestone thing.

  body: Yes, Paul, here&#39;s something for you. I haven&#39;t posted anything new,
    since I didn&#39;t get much feedback from my first round, but here are two new
    samples. My letterspacing isn&#39;t right yet. And I&#39;m still working on things,
    like the uppercase. The second sample shows some alterations to 5 uppercase letters
    that I&#39;m working on now. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28750.gif"

  body: Wow, very nice, Dan. <BR>The lowercase seems fine to me. But maybe I&#39;d
    like to see a descending z. The uppercase... yes, it needs work. There are some
    good ideas, like the two A&#39;s in your bottom image, and the T, but there are
    also some confusing glyphs, like V/W, M/N, O/P/Q, I/J. Finally, I&#39;d try to
    make the figures just a bit heavier.

  body: Dean, <BR> <BR>This is beautiful type. It really stands apart from every other
    Textura I&#39;ve seen. Keep going in the same direction with it. You already recognize
    that the spacing is an issue, and that&#39;s the only major thing I&#39;ve noticed.
    <BR> <BR>You should consider adding a half-r, which looks somewhat like a condensed
    x-height 2. One example can be found in Helzel&#39;s K

  body: hey thanks dan. it&#39;s looking good! i&#39;d have to agree that some of
    the caps are confusing, i have the most trouble with the O/P/Q and the Y &amp;
    Z just don&#39;t seem to fit with the rest for me. For some reason i also feel
    that the figures don&#39;t fit either. They seem to belong more to the Schwabacher
    style. The lowercase really shines, if you can just pull the uppercase and figures
    up to their level you&#39;d have a real solid face. keep up the good work!

    <BR> <BR>Yes. That&#39;s Gerhard Helzel&#39;s site. His main blackletter page
    is <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur1.htm">here</a> and his general
    page is <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/">here.</a> I don&#39;t know if
    he speaks English, but he appears to understand Latin and Greek. He&#39;s built
    a library of neglected and forgotten blackletter fonts. He added some swift code
    info, so I guess he&#39;s been getting some foreign orders lately. <BR> <BR>--

    it&#39;s something like $200 savings, and making the swich is worth it, IMO.

    generally substituted after a &#34;round&#34; letter like o, p, or b. <BR>There
    may be more to it than that, but i think that&#39;s it! <BR>The diaganol of the
