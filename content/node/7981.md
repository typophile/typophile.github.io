body: Thought I would ask the esteemed members of this forum this question... <BR>
  <BR>There seems to be some major problems happening with folks working with fonts
  using OSX 10.3 and Suitcase 11 &#40;and often Quark 6&#41;. I work at a font company
  &#40;in Australia&#41; and we are getting maybe 4-5 calls per week from people with
  this system combo and all saying that fonts are either corrupt, won&#39;t install
  or are invisible on their systems. We have tested &amp; established that the font
  is fine and often works in classic or OSX 10.2.x or when installed direct to the
  OS &amp; going around Suitcase. Is it some kind of conflict with Fontbook? Does
  anyone know what is going on? I think this is a major issue but can&#39;t put my
  finger on what is happening. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>PAUL
