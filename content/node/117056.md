body: "So, I have been working on writing up detailed step-by-step instructions on
  how to install RoboFab, FontTools/TTX and friends to go with FontLab Studio. Both
  Mac and Windows. I figured if I found some aspects non-obvious I would not be alone.\r\n\r\nThe
  scripts and such that one can run with these tools are very handy, even if you are
  not interested in writing your own scripts. \r\n\r\nI am pretty much done, but before
  I post them on the FontLab blog, I could use a small number of folks who are interested
  in installing these bits, to test out my instructions.  :)  Especially on Windows,
  as it has fewer font-editing folks and doesn\u2019t get as much attention.\r\n\r\nIf
  interested, just drop me a note here and I will pass you the current draft."

    be in touch. I am just glad to have somebody on Windows.\r\n\r\nCharles: TTX 2.4
    has a few problems, but 2.3 is increasingly outdated and is not keeping up with
    new developments. So personally I am going for 2.4."

    with TTX -- haven't quite figured out how I'll use it yet, aside from straightening
    out font naming for the various platforms. While we have and use NT, XP, Vista,
    7, 8, and 8.1, FontLab is only on my 7 at work, and my 8 (tablet) as portable.
    And I am using the TTX 2.3 build..."

  body: Yes, I missed especially the Windows version. Many students of type design
    use Windows based computers and many resigned to install Python just because they
    could get reliable manual how to do that. Fortunately, in 2011 a good guy created
    http://typophile.com/node/81979. It saved me probably several weeks my of life!

  body: Ooh, forgot about that one. Of course, it still refers to Python 2.4, and
    old versions of other components. That's part of why I wanted to do a new thing.

  body: "I would love instructions. All this technical stuff scares me a bit. It's
    the main reason I haven't worked with any scripts yet, though I'm starting to
    realize I definitely should to speed up some aspects of my design process.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I use Windows and never intend to go Apple. I'm annoyed Windows doesn't
    have a bigger focus on typography though. I've seen great software which isn't
    available for Windows. For one, managing fonts is absolutely terrible on Windows.
    I often have to restart my computer just to update a font because it keeps saying
    it's in use. Do you have any recommendations to make that process more efficient?"

  body: "Font software is weak on Windows mostly because it's generally developed
    by very small teams... many of which have some consumerist brand-loyalty issues
    going on...\r\n\r\nOne reason to prefer Windows however is its lack of hipster
    elitism, the avoidance of supporting one of the psychologically nastiest tech
    companies out there (to me Apple is the Disney of computers), not to mention supporting
    a company that has paid good money for great typefaces to be made for many years
    now. Versus making Chalkboard.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the only serious font manager on Windows is Suitcase Fusion from Extensis. But
    I used to work for them and so on, so I might not be unbiased. Then again, I believe
    there are reasonable alternatives on Mac OS, just not on Windows."
