  body: "I found this in a German book of Script types published in 1993. It is called
    Abel kursiv. If this is in digital form I have not found it by this name. The
    book lists Agfa as the source, but it's not in the 1999 Creative Alliance book.\r\n\r\n-

    lists the designer of \"Abel Cursive\" as Bernie Abel and says it was a Compugraphic
    font in 1974. I think that means it was a film type. Apparently, not digitized.\r\n\r\n-
