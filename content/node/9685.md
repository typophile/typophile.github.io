    owned by the same company, I think.&#41;

    to the 3 other threads on this very subject? Use the search, Petter!&#41; <BR>
    <BR>It really depends on what you need in a font manager, Petter. <BR>Do you need
    auto-activation? Is Classic support important? <BR>Do you want really good printed
    catalogs of your library? Or are  <BR>you just looking for something to turn fonts
    on and off?'

  body: I use suitcase on a PC &#40;bleh&#41; and it&#39;s kind of buggy.  Usually
    it gets the job done, but don&#39;t spend too much time creating font lists and
    categorizing fonts in Suitcase as inevitably your list will get corrupt and you&#39;ll
    have to redo all the work over again.  It&#39;s a common problem according to
    Extensis, I found after my first tech support call.  So now I keep the fonts themselves
    in categorized folders and try to let the software do little more than turn fonts
    on and off. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure it works flawlessly on a Mac though. <BR> <BR>How
    is Reserve superior to Suitcase?

  body: I use Suitcase X1  <BR> <BR>When I first switched to OS X I used Font Reserve.
    Then I switched to Suitcase. Then I switched back to Font Reserve. Then I switched
    to Font Agent. Then I switched to Suitcase X1 and I still use it. I grew accustomed
    to not having auto-activation when I first switched to OS X, and now I am happily
    working without it. I know my fonts. I like the feeling of total control. I&#39;m
    a power freak. Ehehe. Umm ... anyhoo ... I recommend Suitcase X1.

  body: All of the font managers out there leave something running as an application
    &#40;with FontReserve it&#39;s the &#34;FontReserve Database&#34;, with FAP it&#39;s
    the &#34;FontAgent Activator&#34;&#41;. The main difference with Suitcase is that
    it&#39;s visibly running, and the browser and the activator are the same application.
    It&#39;s only really annoying when you, like a friend of mine, are unable to get
    Suitcase to quit when you shut down the machine or log out. <BR> <BR>James, why
    do you like MasterJuggler? WAY back when it was my favorite font manager &#40;we&#39;re
    talking 1990 here&#41;, and I was intrigued to see that it was brought back from
    the grave, but it&#39;s been frustratingly difficult to dig up information on
    it.

  body: I use FontReserve at work. It&#39;s good. It very occasionally has problems
    with fonts that aren&#39;t 100%, but nothing that doesn&#39;t go away on restart.
    <BR> <BR>I have to admit that Stephen&#39;s intense support for Font Agent has
    piqued my interest, since I don&#39;t use anything at home &#40;bad idea, I know&#41;.

  body: I have tried all of the font managers for OSX and decided MasterJuggler was
    it.  <BR> <BR>MJ works very much like the old ATM Deluxe. You activate and deactivate
    fonts from anywhere on your system. It does not copy or create a database, it
    just turns on and off fonts. You can create sets, you can browse the various Unicode
    ranges, and you don&#39;t have to keep it running in the background all the time.
    <BR> <BR>There is no auto-activation, but I was told by Altsys theat that was
    something they were going to include in a future version. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately
    they don&#39;t offer a downloadable trial version. <BR> <BR>But they did have
    me listed as a registered user from back in the System 7 days, and they gave me
    the upgrade price.

  body: I want to put in a good word for Font Agent Pro. I&#39;m a new voice on this
    list but over the last 15 years I have used a variety of font management tools.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m macBased and was quite content with Adobe&#39;s solution. I&#39;d
    previously purchased and struggled through using Juggler and Suitcase.  <BR> <BR>When
    Adobe stopped supporting ATM I switched to Font Reserve.  It worked fine but after
    Extensis purchased the software it apparently wasn&#39;t supported as it should
    have been. I had problems with it after upgrading my Mac operating system to Panther.
    Customer support was excellent but in the end they couldn&#39;t resolve the problem.
    <BR> <BR>I switched to FontAgent Pro a couple of months ago and it&#39;s running
    well. I hope it continues to do so.  <BR> <BR>Eunice

  body: Kris  <BR> <BR>I have FontCache cleaner and still use it occasionally with
    Onyx <BR>for various cache cleaning. <BR> <BR>I should note that I&#39;ve never
    been a fan of having more than <BR>one typeface installed at a time so I realize
    I&#39;m a bit of an <BR>outsider on the font managment debate. I should logically
    <BR>just throw the fonts I&#39;m testing into the &#34;fonts&#34; folder on my
    <BR>system but MJ makes it easy as you avoid some of the caching. <BR>I say some
    because I&#39;m not certain a.&#41; how the much it caches <BR>if at all and b.&#41;
    how much Adobe apps are caching on their own.

  body: If you consider FontAgent Pro, I recommend trying the free demo first. I tried
    it the other day; I spent the first half of my evening trying unsuccessfully to
    make it work properly, and the other half getting rid of it and make my system
    usable again. <BR> <BR>Feature-wise, though, FAP does seem ideal. I might give
    MasterJuggler a try too, but I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a demo available.
