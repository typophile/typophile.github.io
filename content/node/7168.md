    looks any better? &#34; <BR> <BR>Not to be harsh, but no. It looks worse.  <BR>
    <BR>Tell us more about the firm. What kind of modelling? Who hires them? Who models
    for them? What did the worm originally refer to? Anything? What city is it in?
    Etc. <BR> <BR>I think you are trying too hard here. Keep it simple. Find a really
    nice typeface and work with that as the foundation.'

    Here are a few sample directions you can take.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51600.gif"

  body: Matan, your last try look somewhat like the AOL triangle, not a good association.
    Everyone is suggesting the same thing, anaylsis and research. I know its not as
    fun as picking a shape or a typeface but it will focus the direction of the business
    and create a rational for the look.

  body: 'Take the advice of the <a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/luxury/">Orange
    Italic boys</a> and stick closer to fashion convention for your type. Thus far,
    you&#39;re missing the mark. Although, I&#39;m not sure I can recommend dropping
    $1500 for the Luxury collection specifically. <BR> <BR>Your versions in post 477
    are better by far, but remind me of Crate &amp; Barrel and a &#39;modern&#39;
    style that&#39;s not as contemporary anymore. Without more information than I
    have, I&#39;d go with elegant and sophisticated, rather than fun or modernist.
    <BR> <BR>PS: Avoid the ampersand, otherwise you might get a call from a certain
    candy company...'

  body: 'Chris, the versions in 477 aren&#39;t the OP&#39;s. I actually like the very
    last one &#40;the 3 hump m&#41;, but I agree that the others are too Crate &amp;

    ampersand were large and decorative, and 2&#41; the M&#39;s were uppercase &#40;since
    the candy is lowercase&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Besides, there are already a number of

  body: You are still trying too hard using extraneous decoration. What is the loop
    for? Keep it simple. Real simple, and THEN work up from there. For now, why not
    just try setting &#39;MM Studio&#39; in a variety of type styles/weights?

  body: The logo on your site is the best version you have so far.  <BR>I am guessing
    from your domain name that you are based in Italy. I am not sure what trends are
    popular in Italy these days &#40;I am mostly familiar with 2 type designers work
    from there-Fabrizio Schiavi &#40;FSD fonts&#41;, and Claudio Piccinini&#41; but  <BR>for
    some reason your work looks more Eastern European. I say this because I worked
    with a sign company from Romania for a couple of years, and the stretched type
    is very common there. Your work shown here is dated looking, it appears to be
    &#34;new wave&#34; 80&#39;s / early 90&#39;s looking. I do not known if this is
    intentional &#40;as in &#34;retro&#34;&#41; but in my opinon it is not working
    at all. The type you have currrently on your site, although perhaps not refined,
    is  <BR>superior to the stretched work show here. For critique <BR>you have come
    to the right place, so stick with some of the advice and keep going. Start with
    concept, then fonts, then legibility, then refine concept, proportion.....
