body: "I am have a hard time finding detailed information on making style sets in
  Word 2007. The on-line tutorials are too basic. I want to not only use styles, but
  set up fairly fool-proof templates for others to use during a two-year institutional
  self-study process.\r\n \r\nThe issue I\u2019m looking at is how to establish standardized
  formats that can be used to unify information from many different sources (8 schools/colleges;
  perhaps 135 academic units). Many reports will need to be kept in both print and
  electronic form for the 2010 accreditation team to reference. We\u2019ll ultimately
  need to import a series of Word documents into InDesign to produce the final self-study
  report. My understanding is that the cleaner and more consistent the Word documents
  are, the fewer problems arise in InDesign. One of the big issues will be to maintain
  a consistent hierarchy of information with headings, footnotes, numbered lists,
  tables with data, etc.\r\n \r\nI\u2019d love to find references (book, blog, website,
  whatever) that would help me anticipate problems in the process, particularly moving
  information from Word to InDesign.\r\n \r\nThanks very much for your help.\r\n"

    into inDesign, and from my experience, what I found most efficient was to have
    my styles defined in inDesign already and just import the text without formatting
    (ctrl+shift+v), which I added as necessary. Might just have been my specific situation,
    but I'd still tend to think that'd be the way I'd wanna do things, just because
    Word style formatting can be tricky if you're not paying attention. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    goes awry is automatic numbering of headings (and perhaps of lists as well). For
    some reason ID imports it dead wrong -- resetting the numbering and stuff like
    that.\r\n\r\nYou can kill off any of the automatic stuff by selecting \"Unlink
    Fields\" -- unfortunately, I don't remember where to find it in Word! I've had
    a Word Macro for ages, that first asserts \"Track changes\" is off, then accepts
    all changes (!), unlinks fields and removes hyperlinks -- that saves on the number
    of blue underlined texts to unformat. Only then I dare to put it into ID (and
    the next set of scripts go over it once again)."
