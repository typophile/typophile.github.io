  of mechanism used (mainly decades ago) for interactive children's books. It basically
  consists of a pull tab, which when pulled, reveals an image \u2013 however, the
  image is concealed in a sort of venetian blind way \u2013 sort of like outdoor billboards
  that change and have two sides (both sides of the image are sliced into thin strips
  which can rotate and reveal etc)\r\n\r\n...so, any ideas?!"

    mean but don't know the specific name.

    burning childrens' books, e.g. is kerosene or petrol a better fuel? Disappointed.
