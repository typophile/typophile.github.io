  i saw the logo fell in love with it (the logo, i haven't actually read the mag)\r\n\r\nit
  looks like a custom type, but i was wondering if it's based on anything?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n

  body: The logo dates back to the early Sixties when the magazine debuted as the
    Sunday magazine section of the New York Herald Tribune. The original logo was
    set in Caslon and looked more or less similar to the current one. It has been
    redrawn/redesign many times over the years, but retaining the same basic appearance.
    I think only the original one was created from a standard issue typeface. The
    rest have been custom drawn.

  body: "Actually, Patty, they are no longer using that one, either.\r\n\r\nIf I'm
    not mistaken, the current logo is a revival of one that Peter Palazzo did...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002176.php#comments\r\n\r\nSee
    also this great interview with Michael Bierut, where he describes his decision
    to revive Palazzo's logo (yes, they transcribed \"Caslon Swash\" as \"Caslon Swatch,\"
    but it's still a great article!):\r\n\r\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3992/is_200107/ai_n8971587\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I'd like to say that the current designers of <em>New York</em> are doing an outstanding
    job... If you haven't seen it in a while, Patty, do check it out, if only for
    their design."

  body: Ricardo - I do appreciate the new design and I tried recently to give it another
    chance. But in terms of content, I still find it pretty unreadable. It celebrates
    the most egregious aspects of NY to me (as exemplified by our mayor).
