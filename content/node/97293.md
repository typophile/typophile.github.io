    and using fonts, so there is nothing wrong with talking about web typography,
    as long as typography and type are not used as synonyms. "

  body: "<em>Ralf H.</em>\r\n<blockquote>Typography IS choosing and using fonts</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo
    essentially a Typographer is a person who chooses typefaces? If that were the
    case, isn't everyone a \"Typographer\"? At least anyone who goes into Microsoft
    Word and chooses a typeface."

    anyone who owns a pipe wrench to be a professional plumber too.
