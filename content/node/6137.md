body: The rule is that for body text and legibility use a serif font. Is this a hard
  and fast rule? I have seen many annual reports, books, etc that use a sans serif
  for their body text and they are all very clean and legible. I am doing an annual
  report and have been told to adhere to the &#34;rule.&#34; But I am wondering if
  that rule is valid and should be a designers default for selecting and setting type.
  <BR> <BR>If you cannot answer this question can you please provide me resources
  on the web that could help.  <BR> <BR>Thank you.

  body: Sometimes the serif body text is hard to pull off to. Its all a matter of
    what works with a few dozen variables, point size, leading, x-height, document
    size, paper.   <BR> <BR>Chip Kidd&#39;s &#34;Cheese Monkeys&#34; set in tight

  body: '&#34;Serifity&#34; is just another variable to weigh against others, but
    for readability it is in fact <i>very</i> significant, second only to &#34;structural
    integrity&#34; and tight &#40;but not too tight&#41; letterspacing. If your text
    is intended&#42; for long continuous reading, you are doing the readers a disservice
    &#40;whether they realize it or not - it&#39;s actually a subconscious issue&#41;
    by using a sans. <BR> <BR>&#42; This &#34;intention&#34; is very important. Long
    text doesn&#39;t necessarily require serifs: it could be fodder in a coffeetable
    book... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I am reading Naomi Klein&#39;s &#34;No Logo&#34;, which is set in Rotis Semi
    Serif and I found I get tired after some time... I find it a bit too &#39;quirky&#39;
    for such long texts. Maybe I&#39;ll get used to it as I still haven&#39;t reached

    of a smaller size and managed to go through 300 pages without getting too tired.
    <BR>IMHO, Optima is a great Sans face for long texts.

  body: I&#39;m curious, in the world of publishing, how are these decisions made?
    Right or wrong, how is it decided to use something such as Rotis Semi Serif to
    set an entire book? <BR> <BR>Would&#39;ve loved to be a fly on the wall at that
    meeting. Incidentally, after my initial enthusiasm, I found it wearing to put
    down No Logo then pick it back up and adjust all over again. Interesting experiment,
    however. I also found it interesting that, in all the reviews I read of No Logo
    before getting it myself, not one critic commented on the typography!

    <BR>A huge question. <BR>Although &#34;unsuitable&#34; is relative - and there
    is no &#34;ideal&#34; text face anyway. <BR> <BR>Just some things that impair
    a serif face from serving for extended reading: <BR>- Setting too loose/tight
    &#40;usually the former&#41;. <BR>- Color too light/dark &#40;usually the former&#41;
    <BR>- Forms too far outside expectation. <BR>- Forms too convergent. <BR>- Bad
    vertical proportions, like too-long descenders. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>Some display faces are more or less unsuitable than others. Palatino began
    life as a display face, but it has become a text face. I don&#39;t think it is
    ideally suited to this role &#40;Aldus is very much better&#41;, but it functions
    reasonably well.

  body: I heard mention of optima,  what is the general consensus as to the legibility
    of this face, when applied to longer body text? This seems -- in my mind -- to
    stick out as one of the more suited sans-serif faces, for setting extended text
    blocks. IS this just a fabrication of my imagination &#40;haha that rhymes&#41;
    induced by my fondness for this face, or is this something that could be pulled
    off. <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve always figured that the vertical axis of Bodoni lends to the tendency

    doesn&#39;t help it either. <BR> <BR>&#34;Bodoni&#39;s work was probably the most

  body: "Would it be ridiculous to say that oblique axis types are more readable because
    they spread letter-differentiating information around a larger portion of the
    word, rather than just the x-height region? Variety of axis might do the same
    thing, as might designing variety into the lower half of letters as well as the
    upper. Fournier, in moving more frankly than was usual to the pointed pen rather
    than the broad pen as his apparent model, was careful to vary real axes, which
    is why I prefer his work to Baskerville's; and variety in the lower portion of
    the vowel range might be one reason why Bembo Book/Letterpress is so readable.
