  body: What if you angled your textblock so that it fit more nicely into that white
    frame?

  body: "The Red oval in the background almost looks like it is munching up your details,
    Maybe ts the placement of your details that needs to change. They seem very squashed
    agains the left side of the card, have you thought about just making the white
    space a little larger, a bit more room to breathe. It may solve your problems,
    as I do like the way your details are set at a different angle to the white space,
    it ads a little tension.\r\n\r\nM"

  body: "How about if you keep the type parallel to the edge of the card range it
    right to an angle taken from the white block, you might find that the e-mail address
    is too big like that maybe increasing the name would help. On another note I don't
    like the virgule with spaces as divider, but if you want to use it you could baseline
    shift it to centre visually on the text and you might want to kern the space between
    6 9 a little tighter.\r\nTim"

  body: "I like a LOT better the second version (w/ the angled text)\r\nAbout the
    size of the white \"box\" I would say that you should have a visual \"turning
    white\" (blanc tournant, en fran\xE7ais) of equal proportions all around the text
    (same amount of white on top, left, right and bottom). You're amlost there! (Are
    you sure about that italic font?) "

    make it too simple....so that they look more powerful. Don't add unnecessary elements
    in it. Also there's a lots of visual emptiness there in your design ..rethink
    of it.\r\n\r\nBTW, among these two....second one loks better.\r\n\r\nsatya"

    the general flow and helps the text in \"the fight against the red oval.\" Perhaps
    moving the white area to the right so it is more even with the red would level
    out the balance?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: I'd definitely increase the white space around your name and details, probably
    by reducing the type size. I don't think your name in all caps works at all, and
    I definitely don't think you should mix all caps, small caps, text figures and
    italics. Set your name apart by leaving some space between it and the rest.

  body: I read a flowery wrench too. I wouldn't get too stuck on making this one work.
    Not that it can't but because it's good to do something else & then circle back.
    And I would ask myself. "Do I want my card to read ( subliminally) as a 'flowery
    wrench'?".

  body: I think it's great to just make stuff & think about what it means later but
    I also think that thinking about whnat you mean to say (albeit subliminally) is
    also good. Take both paths. I also think you could take your oval and spin it
    so it is a bit more north south in orientation & see what happens. But don't neglect
    the deliberate path!

  body: "I thought it was a wrench at first as well. The fleurons add to the confusion.
    Get rid of them, you are mixing counterposing typographic traditions. If you are
    basically stuck on the two items I would box the text as if it were a card laid
    upon the disk. That is, extend the rule that obliterates the disk completely around
    the text. A card within a card. In this case, the text block needs to angle with
    the rule. Get rid of the all caps as well.\r\n\r\nAn old book designer's/typographer's
    maxim, \"Throw out your best idea(s) for the sake of the piece.\" Let it grow
    organically from one idea to the next. Let it design itself. Don't restrict the
    flow.\r\n\r\nGerald"
