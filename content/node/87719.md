  to change to avoid caching issues of different places (OS preview, Illustrator,
  Printers, etc)\r\nI suppose some fields are family-wide (like font.version) and
  some others unique to the file (like font.uniqueid).\r\nDo you change the filename
  when releasing updates (not a new release) ?\r\nThanks"
