body: 'I would like to open up a discussion for us to post free font sites. Here you
  can post where you get your fonts for free. To kick this off, I would like to post
  my absolute favorite site, [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com|Font squirrel.com]]. Check
  it out and post what you think are great free sites. Also, post what licenses this
  site primarily deals with (commercial, CreativeCommons, Demo, etc.). Looking forward
  to see what shows up. '

  body: "I don't know that free fonts are going to be a big sell on this site, where
    many of the users make and sell fonts as a part of their livelihood. Most of the
    rest of us don't think much of the poor quality and limited value of free fonts,
    which often(not always) are worth exactly what they cost.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To add to that, not all of the fonts on those sites are even supposed to
    be circulating free.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself on the homepage for Nick's Fonts,
    he's not too happy they're everywhere for free, and FontSquirrel has some of those
    fonts he would like you to pay (minimally) for.\r\n\r\nIt prob. doesn't matter
    but it's a word of caution for you to be aware of"
