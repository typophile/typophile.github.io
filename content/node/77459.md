  format of the page includes lots of captions and blurbs, some up to 20 lines long,
  but only 200 pixels wide.\r\n \r\nI checked typekit and there are some but they
  don't seem significantly sharper than Verdana.\r\n \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for clear
  legible fonts...?\r\n\r\nSecondly is there a method to lock down the type to encourage
  students from copy and pasting the site content?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: That you checked TypeKit would indicate that you're for looking for a webfont,
    which would enable content to be published as plain text and rendered by the browser.
    On the other hand, you're worried that the plain text might then be copied and
    pasted, which is one of the main advantages of using webfonts. Hmmmmm... Pre-rendering
    the text to images would make it harder to copy the actual text, but still the
    individual images wouldn't be that difficult to save. Rendering the text within
    a Flash container, using <a href="http://www.atomicmedia.net/font.php?font_name=PixelPak">one
    of those microscopic pixel fonts</a>, might be the perfect solution (although
    one could still take screenshots and magnify...)

  body: If you want to prevent cut-and-paste plagairism, you might want to investigate
    "obfuscation" tools. Basically, they translate your text (and code) into HTML
    entities, which render properly in a browser, but look like a bunch of gobledygook
    when pasted into a text application...
