body: "\r\nThe meteg (ga'ya) is one of the most common accents in the Hebrew Bible,
  and it  serves two functions: phonetical & musical. It indicates a secondary accent.
  We said 'accent',  but it is not really  an accent. \r\n\r\nThe meteg is  marked
  by  a short vertical stroke under the word, and generally before the stress syllable.
  It  resembles  the siluk, but has different functions (both are uni05BD).\r\n \r\nGrammatically(1)
  \ there are ten different kinds of metegs.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1). If the phonetical & musical
  \ functions  are under one umbrella. "

  body: "Revia. But please bear in mind that the whole verse is a little bit problematic.\r\nFor
    example, see the book Et Sofer by  Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi/ Qimchi , 1160 \u2013
    1235) \u2014 revia. Moreover, Rashbam (Rabbi Shmuel ben  Meir, 1085 - 1158) said
    \ revia instead of double geresh  \u2014   'ets peri; see Babli  Chullin (Holin)
