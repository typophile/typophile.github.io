  to turn to ID this font fast -- my mom needs help with recreating an old tag from
  her mother's craft business and we'd like to ID the font, but it's a little hard
  to read so Identifont and WhatTheFont are coming up short.  It looks very common,
  but I'm stumped.\r\n\r\nWe need it by tonight, thanks so much!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0454_6555.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0455_3557.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0456_5869.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0457_5399.jpg]"

    and found a font called \"Commercial Script\" (no relation to the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/commercial-script/|Bitstream
