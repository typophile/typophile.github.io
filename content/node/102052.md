  body: SandVo, that extra spacing between the characters would be handled by kerning
    them. You need to establish a kern table for your font.

  body: "Yes, this is a kerning issue. The combinations Ca and C\xE1 have kerning
    values in the font, but your new diacritic characters do not. You need to add
    kerning for these new characters."

  body: "SandVo, my opinion is that your best bet to fix this is to read the manual.
    It would be much quicker than getting help here. The manual is a FREE download
    for Mac and Windows (several language editions), here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/"

  body: 'The FontLab manual is rather daunting (I would imagine even more so if English
    is not your first language) and just figuring out where to look can often be a
    challenge. You''ll find the needed information in Chapter 7: Editing Metrics,
    which contains the section "Editing Kerning" (page 579 in the Mac manual, page
    567 in the Windows version).'
