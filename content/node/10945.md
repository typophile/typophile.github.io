  body: 'Colin - a lot of variables come into play, but <BR>as a general rule, don&#39;t
    mess with the point <BR>size, the tracking, or the character width. <BR> <BR>Break
    the rules for feature layouts, of course. <BR> <BR>Not sure what you mean by leaving
    white space. <BR>Do you have a scan? <BR> <BR>You can air out copy but not &#42;too
    much&#42;. <BR> <BR>Also, read Tim Harrower&#39;s book...mentioned <BR>before
    at typophile. <BR> <BR>If you have time, touch the copy, or have <BR>an editor
    help you touch it. Some of the <BR>most precise editing comes when you are forced
    <BR>to fit something into a confined space. <BR>You see things you normally wouldn&#39;t
    see. <BR> <BR>among other things: <BR> <BR> <BR>_ edit widows <BR> <BR>_ cut redundant,
    &#34;no &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#34; quotes <BR> <BR>_ look at paragraph structure
    &#40;either tighten or loosen based on reporter&#39;s writing style&#41; <BR>
    <BR>_ increase/decrease size of art <BR> <BR>_ increase/decrease # of columns
    / page layout <BR> <BR>_ bust out a pull quote or an infographic <BR> <BR>_ as
    a last resort, run a house ad, or better yet, <BR>set your type in Zapf Dingbats.

  body: 'Why not mess with the point size? As long as it&#39;s within reading range
    it&#39;s fine. Think of fractional increments though. <BR> <BR>Frankly I don&#39;t
    have much experience copyfitting large amounts of text in tight spaces, but in
    terms of typeface integrity I&#39;d say that tracking is the worst thing you can
    do. Second worse is horizontal scaling. Changing the word-space is not too bad.
    Same for leading. Both of those can actually take more abuse than most designers
    realize. <BR> <BR>A good type user can conceivably have a better appreciation
    for the balance of economy versus readability than some type designers. So if
    you have reason to believe that the spacing of the font is too lose for example
    &#40;like in Mrs Eaves&#41;, apply negative tracking &#40;just keep an eye on
    &#34;boundary&#34; glyphs, like the lc &#34;r&#34; - you might need to add some
    custom kerning pairs&#41;. Helvetica for example is too tight for text &#40;assuming
    you have to gall to use it for text anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>Two things I would add:
    <BR>1&#41; Watch the paragraph breaks for places you can save entire lines. <BR>2&#41;
    Try to use a MM font with a width axis. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
