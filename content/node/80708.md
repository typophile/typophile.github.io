    processor running at 3.2 gHz, 1 TB hard drive, 6 gB memory, a 1 mB video card,
    a THX sound card, and a 25" LCD monitor, all for less than $1,200 (with 0% financing
    for 12 months). The Easy Transfer program made migration from my old machine a
    breeze and, with Virtualization and backwards-compatibility modes, I can seamlessly
    run virtually every PC program I have purchased in the last twenty years on the
    box. A Motorola-compatible update for FL Studio for the Mac? Dream on...
