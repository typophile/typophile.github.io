  Mayer's stuff (website/iTunes artist page) he uses Avant Garde and I think that's
  what they're using here but the Rs are DEFINITELY not avant garde.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JM_4675.jpg]\r\n\r\nObviously
  this is a custom font... but what are it's roots?\r\n\r\nAfter doing a \"What The
  Font?\" On the John Mayer album cover for continuum, and it came up as News Gothic
  BT -- the R from that appears to match so perhaps its a combo of both I don't know.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.johnmayer.com|john

  body: "Looks like Avenir(?, experts..please help:P)... but it's obviously been modified
    somewhat\r\n\r\nThe Rs look like Avenir...the JOHN MAYER part it seems to be it..although
    the middle rung of the E has been shortened. The S on summer looks like Avant
    Garde, def. not Avenir. Gee..what a mess"

  body: Well I'm pretty sure that most of it comes from Avant Garde (only because
    I know thats what has been used in the past and on lots of other materials) but
    that damn R...

  body: "[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/|Trade Gothic]] seems fairly
    close, but the J has a bit less hook than your sample. The ligatures are probably
    why Avant Garde was suggested, but I think those may be customized from the font
    used, and not necessarily part of the font.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "There are four attributes that I was trying to match: the J (above the baseline
    and fairly closed); the M (straight-sided, with vertex at baseline); the E (short
    center arm); and the R (straight leg intersecting the bowl). The closest sample
    I had in my Sans Guide was Berthold Balken, which I cannot find any more. However,
    it was condensed by comparison to this sample, so it was not an exact match unless
    it had been widened. \r\n\r\nYehan's suggestion of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/|Avenir]],
    does not have the uneven E, but it looks a lot like it in other respects, so let's
    say Avenir, with a modified E, and manufactured ligatures. This would get you
    very close.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Here's the version I whipped up last night in illustrator using Avant Garde
    as my base (though I forget what I used to make the R). I found it to be closer
    than avenir, at least to my eyes...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/adamschoales/2826166880/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the reason I thought that it was avant garde is because that's what he's used
    in the past, for example\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/adamschoales/2826172510/\r\nhttp://www.local-83.com/web/guest/v2login\r\nhttp://johnmayer.shop.musictoday.com/"
