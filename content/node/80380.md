body: "I didn't even know this website existed until a few days ago and I've been
  lurking.  I don't do design or any such thing, but I enjoy a good font.  Anyway,
  my grandfather was a printer at MacKenzie and Harris in San Francisco for 50 years
  and taught me to use a letterpress at age five.  One of those things I have of his
  is a Centaur/Arrighi monotype-sample broadsheet.  If I have the story right, the
  broadsheet was designed by Bruce Rodgers himself and Grabhorn press, but actually
  set and printed by my grandfather in 1948.  Anyway, figured all of you might get
  a kick out of it.  \r\n\r\nNot the greatest picture in the world.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_1372_5066.jpg]"
