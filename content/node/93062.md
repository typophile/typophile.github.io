  main style being early 1900s Arts & Craft, Art Nouveau, etc. The designers are women,
  however they don't want to alienate male clients, thus do not want anything too
  feminine. \r\n\r\nThe san serif for Daunte is set in stone. Please don't critique
  that. Please don't critique the name. Or kerning. However, I'm looking for opinions
  on the script. Does the overlap work? What about style of script? Any thoughts on
  the script with the san serif is appreciated, or suggestions for better scripts.\r\n\r\nWhat
  about the color scheme in #2?  The others are just randoms.\r\n\r\nThe logo will
  be a text only logo. However, at times it may be set over the ornate watermark.

  body: "Sorry, can't help it: the style of \"DAUNTE\" is right on, but the spacing
    is too uneven, and some of thin strokes (especially in the \"T\") are too thin.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the script text: the names are idiosyncratic enough that you need extra legibility,
    and the style on the left is too out there. If you go with the style on the right,
    you just need more space on the left of the ampersand.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The script names on the left are a little hard to read. And I'm not sure that
    any of the script names will remain legible if the logo needs to be printed in
    a very small size (as most logos are occasionally). One workaround would be an
    alternate version (with larger script text) to use in small-size situations.

  body: "Thanks for your comments. So appreciated! \r\n\r\nOverall, what is your thought
    of using a script? We want a big contrast with the San Serif. I initially used
    a Goudy serif for contrast, but it didn't seem to have enough pizazz. \r\n\r\nI
    like the right side font better - it's Prosperity - however, I don't think the
    w is a good starting point to the names. It doesn't capture my attention and lead
    me along.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts with the script and watermark? \r\n\r\nAttached
    below is Alana script. I like it's legibility, however feel it's too feminine.
    Thoughts? (Don't worry, I know spacings are off - these are just images copied
    from the font previews. Kerning is yet to come.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_6016.png]"

  body: "I think options 3 and 4 are working better than 1 and 2. The problem I have
    with the overlap is that there isn't much overlap between the two lines of text,
    making the current arrangement a little unsure of itself. I'd suggest trying to
    accentuate the overlap so it becomes a real feature of the logo, or perhaps ditching
    it altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd agree with JamesM, you might have problems with reading
    the script letters as the logo gets smaller."

  body: "Overall it's not bad. It seems that the top of your DAUNTE type has been
    cut off, that\u2019s why the horizontal bar at the top seems too small, the bottom
    is better. I would redraw the DAUNTE typeface to give a more rounded look without
    the oblique cut on the /T/E. I don't think Alana script is too feminine but I
    would try an ampersand smaller as the one we find in the Minion italic. Keep going."
