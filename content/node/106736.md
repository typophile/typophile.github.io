  Roger White's \"Carolus\" for http://typophile.com/node/106734 I came across this
  squared sans serif that he calls \"Telford.\"  It looks like it was created by Photolettering
  or Filmotype in the 1960s as an exercise in optical stretching of font width. There
  is also an outline version and italics.\r\nDoes anyone know anything about the source
  font?\r\nThanks.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "From the txt file in the copy folder I have:\r\n\r\nABOUT THE FONT\r\n\r\n'TELFORD'
    is a high quality font containing full hinting for correct rendering\r\nat small
    point sizes and a total of 926 kerning pairs for correct character\r\nspacing.
    It is supplied 'as is' and no waranty is implied or given by the\r\nauthor. The
    font is suitable for both headlines and body text, and should\r\nrender well down
    to 8 point. The font contains a full range of upper and lower\r\ncase letters
    together with the figures 0 to 9, a full range of punctuation,\r\nbut no diacritics.
    It was hand traced in order to achieve a high quality outline\r\nand compiled
    using Type Designer 3.1. This font represents aproximately 400\r\nmanhours of
    work.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of this font is always available for download
    from the \r\nfile list of the fonts conference on the Cix conferencing system.
    The author \r\nwould appreciate notification of any problems experienced with
    this font \r\ntogether with any suggestions for improvements.\r\n\r\nRoger White,\r\n1,
