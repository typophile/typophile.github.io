body: Looking for alternatives to DIN that can be purchased in Open Type format and
  include an italics version for all weights.  I have found DIN versions that meet
  both requirements but I was hoping to find another font with its own unique touch
  yet similar in form and style.   While I love DIN I find it being used everywhere
  and it has grown somewhat old on both our design and editorial staff thus the search
  for a fresh alternative.  Thanks.
