body: "I am creating some unusual glyphs in my font, for example 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
  N WITH DOT ABOVE'. How should I name such new glyph? Unicode convention say it should
  combine two unicode values, so if LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N is 004E and DOT ABOVE is
  02D9, than new glyph could be uni004E02D9. Is this correct? \r\n\r\nHowever, in
  the Unicode, one can also find the combining accents, and there COMBINING DOT ABOVE
  is 0307. So, should this LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH DOT ABOVE, be named after all
  uni004E0307, combining these two unicode values (004E + 0307)?\r\n\r\nI am planning
  to write also the CCMP feature for the right composing/decomposing of these glyphs.
  Does it make any difference how I name these glyphs? Will both ways render the glyphs
  the same way? What is considered more correct?\r\n\r\nthanks, Peter\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Karsten Luecke was kind enough and pointed me to example of Arno Pro. A similar
    issue of for example LATIN CAPITAL LETTER G WITH TILDE ABOVE is solved by naming
    it as it was a ligature (g_tildecomb), and added a line of code in their CCMP
    feature (sub G tildecomb by G_tildecomb;).\r\n\r\nIf anyone from Adobe is reading
    this, is this how they suggest solving this issue? Will typing the G followed
    by tilde enter this glyph in text, provided the application supports CCMP feature?
