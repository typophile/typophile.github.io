body: "Hi! I do some freelance teaching work in my spare time. I have a tax credit
  because of that and am thinking about buying a nice body text serif font for my
  own freelance teaching work (mostly lesson plans and powerpoint slides) that\u2019s
  got more range than Garamond. (If this post feels familiar I posted it just before
  Christmas, but I think nobody noticed!)\r\n\r\nI have a couple of criteria I\u2019m
  looking for, in descending order of importance. No choice about foundry-in fact
  I\u2019d be keen to support a small one doing something really good. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n
  \ <li>Budget: ideally not more than $200 for the family. One-computer license, no
  web use envisaged.</li>\r\n  <li>Old-style font would be my preference; something
  less hard than a Times. Should be very friendly and readable. I'd prefer something
  that looks genuine and authoritative without looking too mannered. I like Caslon,
  if that helps.</li>\r\n  <li>Needs to plays nice with Word and apps that don\u2019t
  understand everything about OpenType. Separate small caps fonts would be extremely
  helpful.</li>\r\n  <li>Ideally reasonably tight linespacing.</li>\r\n  <li>Optical
  caption/titling variants would be nice too.</li>\r\n  <li>Bold style that\u2019s
  clearly bold but not too thick. Needs to not stand out against quite small headings.</li>\r\n
  \ <li>Swash option would be nice, again ideally as a separate font or at least as
  a separate numbered stylistic set Word can use.</li>\r\n  <li>Needs lining figures
  for maths.</li>\r\n</ol>"

  body: "Let's see if any of my text favorites pleases you... I really really love
    [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/lyon/lyon_text|Lyon Text]], you can get
    four styles for $200, say one of the two Regulars and Semibold with their respective
    italics. It is a beautiful face inspired by old-style (Granjon) but with a very
    friendly and contemporary appeal, with a lot of versatility IMO. It has lining
    figures, alternates and what not... The Text styles don't have swashes, but Lyon
    Display does have them.\r\n\r\nAlso, for just $239 you can get the whole 20 styles
    (!) of [[https://philsfonts.com/index.php/fonts/overview/GF060014X1|Freight Text]],
    a fantastic workhorse text face, maybe not so close to the style you prefer, but
    one that I would never regret buying, especially at that price for the entire
    family.\r\n\r\nIn [[http://www.typophile.com/node/39592#comment-244536|this thread]],
    there's a list of some other awesome text faces you can browse and compare.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helped!"

    as well. It may fit your bill quite nicely:\r\n1. $200 is fitting (we can make
    an off-site arrangement).\r\n2. it\u2019s Old Style, rather Venetian. A new design,
    no remake.\r\n3. has a separate small caps font. SC Italic would be an additional
    option.\r\n4. linespacing shall be OK (depends on your appl. settings).\r\n5.
    Optical caption/titling variants exist, however, they are not (yet) released.
    \u2013 optional.\r\n6. The Bold styles are clearly bold but not too thick.\r\n7.
    A Swash option font (named Scriptive) is in the 6-font package.\r\n8. lining figures
    are not in as a default. But I can make them default for you if you want.\r\n\r\n[[http://stoetzner-gestaltung.prosite.com/279225/andron-special|Here]]
    are some samples how it looks like."

  body: "Thanks for the recommendations-I thought I'd come back to this! I ended up
    narrowing it down to a shortlist which I will probably think about for a while.
    \r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-1-lat-corpus/|Andron]]
    is very near the top of my shortlist, since having styles as separate fonts is
    very practical if I ever need small caps in Word.  And the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-1-lat-corpus/scriptive/|scriptive]]
    italic is lovely - just the kind of extra bonus I was looking for buying something
    new. My one reservation was its sizing - using the free version it seems a little
    small with wide lines than other typefaces set to about the same width, I imagine
    not a problem in a book but more difficult if you need to fit the absolute maximum
    amount of material clearly on one single page as I sometimes do. Williams Caslon
    has been high on my shortlist too ever since I read Berkson's [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/07/26/reviving-caslon-the-snare-of-authenticity/|own
    article]] on it, which as an outsider to type design I found fascinating. Lyon
    and Freight not so much - Freight just felt a bit too close to Times New Roman
    for comfort! I hemmed and hawed about Skolar, but those dagger serifs just didn't
    work for me.\r\n\r\nI'm also considering [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/hoftype/ashbury|Ashbury]]
    from Hoftype. It's a bit more modern than I was expecting I'd like, and clearly
    a bit of a display font with that x-height, but testing on paper with the free
    light weight everything about it feels really rather well-balanced. Some other
    Hoftype designs appeal to me, but that one most of all somehow. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/|LTC
    Kennerley]] would be higher on my list - it's a lovely, rounded design that almost
    feels like Futura reincarnated as an old style serif with lots of near-perfect
    circles, and it has a small caps font - if it had an option to switch on a more
    restrained italic. I like swashes, but sometimes you just want to completely turn
    them off... Less likely, I also somehow like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/vulpa/|Vulpa]]
    a lot (maybe it's nostalgia - I read a lot of books in that kind of chunky serif
    growing up), though the bold looks a bit thick for me, and I'm also considering
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/fiesole/|Fiesole]] because of its optical
    size set-a bit above what I was hoping to pay, but not an unfair price for the
    range of options. Any thoughts?"

    Of the options you're already considering, Andron is indeed very nice.
