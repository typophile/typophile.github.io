  is an attached image of the logo for Velbon tripods.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v38/Orgo65/Velbon-Logo_zps73818783.png\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for this font for a project, and despite using MyFonts' \"WhatTheFont\"
  engine, and WhatFontIs, I have yet to find a match for the sans serif font used
  in the Velbon logo.\r\n\r\nAny help, regarding this font is appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDr.
