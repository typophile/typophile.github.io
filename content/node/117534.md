  and ideally I'd like to be able to render the wordmark part of the logo in any major
  world language/character set while keeping the look consistent.\r\n\r\nParticularly
  tricky are Chinese / Japanese / Korean characters. I'm aware that there are options
  such as pairing Helvetica World with DF Hei etc, and all-in-one solutions like Nimbus
  Sans Global. But ideally I\u2019d like to know if there are any more contemporary
  alternatives  which don\u2019t cost the earth (the client is a charity and they
  don\u2019t have oodles of money to spend on the visual ID). If the only options
  are expensive, then maybe pointers on that too.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics I\u2019m
  looking for :\r\n\r\nModern, Approachable, Not necessarily a Sans (but that\u2019s
  probably what the client is expecting). They\u2019re using Helvetica at the moment,
  and they want to move away from that to something a bit more distinctive and friendly
  (a *bit* more, as I appreciate the options are probably going to be limited.)\r\n\r\nAny
  other related advice would be very much appreciated."

    it will be ready by November 2014, but I'll post it still.\r\n[[https://www.behance.net/wip/491857/1193185]]\r\nIt's
    called Mir Sans, Mir is a Russian word meaning both \"world\" and \"peace\". It
    has support for Extended Latin with IPA, Full extended cyrillic glyph coverage,
    Politonic Greek, all currency signs, Hebrew with nikkudot, Armenian with armenian
    ligatures, Georgian scripts: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri, Mkhedruli and Mkhedruli Mtavruli.
    Also I have future plans to support Arabic scripts, Hangul (Korean) and some other
    minor scripts like Tifinagh."

  body: "goloub's project sounds fabulous, but I will note that does not cover Chinese
    and Japanese.\r\n\r\nThere are very very few such typefaces in the world today.
    Mostly, it is a crazy huge amount of work. To ascertain what is available, you
    would have to define exactly what you consider to be the major world language/character
    sets. You mention Chinese, Japanese and Korean. I assume that you would include
    extended Latin and extended Cyrillic. Greek? Arabic? Hebrew? Indic languages (and
    which ones)?\r\n\r\nYou might find this a useful reference to some fonts that
    might help: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_font\r\n... although I will note
    that there are no particular criteria for what is included, as far as I can determine.
    It is an arbitrary set. But pretty much anything that meets your needs is probably
    in there, as well as a bunch of fonts which are no different from hundreds of
    others that are not in the list.\r\n"

    far easier to find, especially since not all characters needed for many African
    languages have single Unicode codepoints assigned -- they require Latin characters
    plus the combining diacritics.\r\n\r\nI'f anyone knows good examples, I'd be quite
    pleased to know of them."

    in some deliberate visual harmony (which good typographers value). African languages
    are mostly Latin-based, so sort of automatically harmonize.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, two things:\r\n\r\n1) The question was about a single typeface, and\r\n2)
    The question was about any *major* world language\r\n\r\nI did ask what constitutes
    \u201Cmajor.\u201D\_I am quite certain that Chinese and Japanese would, as they
    were among the examples. I am not so convinced that the OP meant to include less
    widely supported African languages with that phrase.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that
    getting CJK support in one coordinated typeface is a lot less common than support
    for minority African languages in an extended Latin typeface. \r\n\r\nI also agree
    with Hrant and the OP that it is tricky to coordinate typographic feel across
    radically different writing systems."

  body: "Yes, many African languages are Latin based. Some are based on Arabic, and
    I'd imagine the support there is greater, but I do not know for sure. \r\n\r\nWithin
    the so-called (African) Latin-based writing systems, the <strong>alphabets</strong>
    of these languages are not fully supported by very many fonts. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa
    Off the top of my head, only the SIL offerings of Gentium, Doulos, and Charis
    support Yoruba, Pan Nigerian, Swahili, Boko (writing system for Hausa) etc. \r\n\r\nThe
    sans Andika covers the several alphabets, but currently is available in roman
    only. If anyone knows of others, I'd be thrilled to know, and I'd think there
    would be some customers for such fonts.\r\n\r\nMaybe the excuse is there aren't
    <strong>any</strong> \"majority\" African languages? \r\n\r\nI think it was Thomas
    who, some time ago, remarked that when the alphabets are quite different, a variation
    in font design doesn't seem too distracting. That would be true for Latin versus
    CJK, but not the Latin versus Latin-based African languages, so maybe the final
    excuse is that from a commercial point of view, Africa isn't a large enough market
    to worry about.\r\n\r\nWell, a danger of getting too far off-topic.\r\n"
