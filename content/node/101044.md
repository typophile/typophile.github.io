  body: "Wow this looks great! I guess that there was quite a lot of work behind this
    project.\r\n\r\nSome congratulations:\r\n- \"bespoke\" seems to be very well designed
    with much regard to metaness \r\n- the modulator is the first kind of GUI I have
    ever seen for METAFONT\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n- is there a chance for an offline
    program version of the modulator (please say yes)?\r\n- is \"bespoke\" just a
    side product of the modulator or vice versa or will you develop them both further
    on?\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n- if you are using mf2pt1 you might consider a
    change to the simpler combination metapost&fontforge. Just look [[https://github.com/khaledhosny/punk-otf/blob/master/tools/build.py|here]]
    how Khaled Hosny used this combination for \"Punk Nova\" . It should work perfectly
    for your METAFONT-designs (unfilling may sometimes be problematic but you do not
    seem to need unfilling commands) (Oh and if you will add kerning you can also
    use a [[https://github.com/hanwen/mftrace/blob/master/tfm.py|Python module for
    the TeX-Font-Metrics]])\r\n- the character \"k\" of \"bespoke\" is suboptimal
    constructed (the forward looking diagonal sometimes begins under the upright stem)\r\n-
    consider writing an article in TUGboat, I think many TeX-related people will be
    interested in your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello wei and fujito\r\n\r\nThanks for putting Metaflop on this forum. And
    thanks for the inputs. there are still many ideas we haven't realized and worked
    out properly \u2013 including extended ec-glyph range, optical corrections and
    kernings for our Metafonts. The interface is partly working well but far from
    being complete. At the moment its for experimental use and works as an application
    in type education. We hope to get closer to more redefined fonts (with keeping
    maximum metaness) and interface.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some questions:\r\n- is there
    a chance for an offline program version of the modulator (please say yes)?</blockquote>\r\nWe
    have no plans for the near future to create an offline application of Metaflop.
    It would be too much work to reimplement the server and browser-part as we have
    it at the moment. Further considerations are also:\r\n1. which platform should
    be targeted first\r\n2. we can reach a wider audience with the online version\r\n3.
    a web application has many advantages: easy application updates, platform independence,
    no installation required...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- is \"bespoke\" just a side product
    of the modulator or vice versa or will you develop them both further on?</blockquote>\r\nMF
    Bespoke and the modulator were developed simultaneously. Metafont as an early
    and existing parametric type system needed a GUI. A second font MF Adjuster was
    added a bit later. We would be happy to make the modulator more independent and
    publish other Metafonts on it.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some suggestions:\r\n- if you
    are using mf2pt1 you might consider a change to the simpler combination metapost&fontforge.

    a lot! We don't use unfill in Bespoke or Adjuster. The current fonts work with
    \"penstroke/penpos\" or \"draw\". We'll definitely have a look at the proposal
    and consider it for further adaptions of our tool chain. \r\n"

  body: "Short Metaflop-update: \r\nWe completed our MetaFont [[http://www.metaflop.com/metafonts/adjuster|Adjuster
    ]] to T1 (ec-encoding) that covers 256 characters supporting many european languages
    with latin writing. Thanks to fujito we also embedded a new script mf2outline.py.
    The script enables us (and everybody that works with Metafont) proper transformations
    of specific MF drawing modes (draw, fill and penstroke) to outline curves and
    OTFs. You can get the script here: \r\nhttps://github.com/metaflop/metaflop-www/tree/master/bin"
