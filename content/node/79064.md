  body: "I think while both of the other answers do resemble the 3D lettering that
    was created, they are not identical to it. Museo Sans has a curved l for one thing,
    and the 'a'top arc is not quite the same. Avenir also has a mismatch with the
    'a' bowl shape.\r\n\r\nI think the resemblance to either of these is coincidental,
    and is rather bound to happen because there are so many sans fonts that almost
    any version of these seven sans letterforms would be likely to look like SOME
    sans font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
