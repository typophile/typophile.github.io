  from their exact brand name? (ie: Red Bull might have www.redbulldrink.com)\r\n\r\nAny
  examples would be appreciated."

    the luxury of using only the movie title.

  body: "When you say different, how different do you mean?\r\n\r\nAmerican Airlines
    use AA.com as their primary web address but as far as I know (I'm not American)
    is not known as AA.\r\n\r\nIt's complicated by redirection from multiple addresses,
    e.g. British Airways promote ba.com but it just redirects to britishairways.com.\r\n\r\ncontinental.com
    belongs to Continental Airlines not the tyre company (who use conti-online.com).\r\n\r\nms.com
    belongs to Morgan Stanley and not the more obvious software giant."
