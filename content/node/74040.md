body: "I was reviewing recently the typefaces used in Star Trek, Star Wars, Space
  1999, and other science-fiction seriatum.\r\n\r\nThey share in common implausible
  visions of the future of typography. Most of them are impossibly Apollonian, imagining
  that in the future everything will be decided by reason alone, as if reason hadn't
  produced death camps and nuclear bombs along with vaccines and rocket ships. They
  are simple-minded caricatures of type, as Hrant has called Futura; they're geometric
  and other arbitrary conceptual distortions imposed crudely upon the gross form of
  the type to shock the viewer with how different and mathematical they are.\r\n\r\nIn
  truth, though, as important as science, math, and reason are, much of the joy of
  life comes from feelings, from passions, from illogical drives and tender irrationalities,
  like the love of a child, or the discovery of sublime beauty in a new melody. Life
  reduced to the left brain would probably be quite joyless, undermining the reason
  for living at all, which is partly why so many science fiction films intended as
  utopias are really dystopias - the rational, sterile, joyless, overly organized
  visions of the future depict worlds none of us really wants to live in, not even
  their authors. They're just as distorted as the ridiculous typeface caricatures.\r\n\r\nLooking
  backward to the development of type, we see that real progress didn't come from
  fantasizing about the future - the more we focus in abstracto on an imaginary, designed
  future, the more wrong we usually are about the true shape of the future.\r\n\r\nReal
  progress comes not from these fantasies but from focusing on fixing what's wrong
  here and now. Minuscule wasn't invented because someone thought the future would
  look like that, but because monks copying manuscripts as quickly as possible by
  hand for half a millennium and trying to read each other's results moved more and
  more toward the quicker and more legible, more readable shorthand of minuscule,
  reducing the majuscule to an accent character for indicating the start of sentences,
  the start of proper nouns, and so on. Honestly, no amount of prophesying or fantasizing
  about the future of majuscule (if genuine science fiction per se had existed in
  the Roman era rather than just metaphorical analogues) would have concluded that
  aside from a couple new letters it would survive largely unchanged for millennia
  but be integrated with new alphabets and be reduced to infrequent accent characters.\r\n\r\nThe
  problems with majuscules were always there, but they didn't matter until new conditions
  stressed the weaknesses inherent in the form (like the identical character height
  leading to too much uniformity, like the multi-stroke design leading to awkwardness
  when they had to be written rapidly for hours at a time nonstop by so many people
  instead of how they'd been used).\r\n\r\nThis is exactly how very complex software
  that evolves for decades develops - not by abstract prescription but by solving
  the real problems at hand until eventually you look back at the history of changes
  and realize you've profoundly transformed the software in directions you mostly
  wouldn't have predicted.\r\n\r\nSo if we apply that principle to typography, whatever
  honest glimpse into the future of type we can hope for will come not from arguing
  about serifs versus sans, humanist versus geometric, or any other prescriptive,
  theoretical, abstract fantasies but from taking a good long look at the problems
  we're having here and now and thinking about the best fixes. It won't let us look
  thousands of years in the future, or even necessarily hundred, but it might let
  us estimate get a glimpse in to the next dozen years or two. After all, anyone struggling
  to set good type in the early 1980s could have predicted the resurgence of small
  caps, text figures, and other abandoned typographic refinements just based on how
  hard it was to set good type without them.\r\n\r\nSo, what are we struggling with
  today? What widespread defects in contemporary typefaces are going to have to get
  solved because we're fed up with them. Likewise, what new type situations are emerging
  today that are going to increasingly stress today's faces?\r\n\r\nI'm going to offer
  a couple small, tangible predictions based on problems I'm having in my typesetting.\r\n\r\nI
  publish technical works about medical software, which often also involves discussion
  of federal agencies and programs. I have acronyms coming out of my ears, aside from
  all the alpha-numeric variable names I need to refer to within the text. Therefore,
  in the works I publish, I simply have to get figures and acronyms to blend with
  lower-case text. Further, these situations also come up in the titles of books;
  when I refer to, say the MUMPS 1995 Workbook, the title of a book we're publishing,
  in the text of another book, I need small caps and text figures in italic.\r\n\r\nFurther,
  my problems are not unique. The modern world is swimming in acronyms. Even a glimpse
  at Wikipedia, which is by no means complete, shows even many acronyms are not only
  no longer unique but have many possible meanings. The value of acronyms, in other
  words, for distinguishing different ideas in as few characters as possible, is already
  breaking down, and eventually our language and culture will have to adopt new strategies
  to deal with the problem. Until then, though, we are going to have more and more
  of them to deal with in text and in titles in many technical fields.\r\n\r\nHence,
  I predict the importance of small caps is going to grow until most contemporary
  typefaces will include them, and those without them will be considered old-fashioned
  relics.\r\n\r\nAlso, and for largely the same reasons, the importance of text figures
  will continue to grow, and there will come a time when typefaces without them are
  seen as crude and obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe same holds for italic text figures, to deal
  with book titles and italicized quotes that include figures.\r\n\r\nNone of that
  is particularly risky as far as predictions go - though there was a time a few decades
  ago when it would have been seen as outrageous, flying in the face of the widespread
  simplemindedness that led us to believe we not only needed only one case of figures
  but even just one case of letters.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we make use of these features,
  other problems gradually emerge, which is where my other small predictions come
  from.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a brief window in which historically conscious typefaces
  like Requiem would be released without lining figures - only text figures - but
  I believe that approach, too, will be abandoned over time because we need lining
  figures for headings and other all-uppercase settings. Indeed, the Hoefler and Frere-Jones
  foundry is updating Requiem to add them, among many other things.\r\n\r\nSecond,
  although many typefaces that include small caps exclude italic small caps, I believe
  this too will pass, because we increasingly need to be able to refer to acronyms
  within italicized text. There will come a time when including small caps without
  also including italic small caps will be considered as eccentric as including text
  figures without lining figures.\r\n\r\nThird - and this is less about which characters
  are included than about how they're used - the increasing use of small caps for
  acronyms is also increasing the number of sentences that open with small caps. Technical
  people in particular seem bewildered by English's comparatively simple rules for
  capitalization, to the point that when they discover the use of small caps for acronyms
  they will allow a sentence to start without a capital letter if the initial word
  is a small-caps acronym. Surely the basic structure of English writing pretty much
  requires that first letter be upper case, even if the opening word is a small-caps
  acronym. I predict we'll see more small-caps words whose initial letter is upper
  case at the beginning sentences or in titles.\r\n\r\nThese are small predictions,
  but they're based on the real typographic problems that come up in my day-to-day
  typesetting. If it weren't for the peculiarities of the material, I wouldn't see
  these particular stresses on our writing systems.\r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nI'd very much
  like to know what little stresses come up in your typesetting, the things that maybe
  other people aren't as likely to see. If we all share the little problems that come
  up, maybe together we can get an honest look into our immediate typographic future,
  or at least something more plausible than the fonts of Star Trek and Babylon 5.\r\n\r\nPostscript:
  No need to refute my little predictions, since I take them all with plenty of salt.
  I'm just proposing we try approaching the future backward, by focusing on our real
  problems and how we solve them rather than theorizing."

  body: "Science-fiction movies often do show typefaces being used for signage and
    the like that are unreadable merely because they look \"futuristic\". The idea
    is to create a visual look for the show that is understood by present-day viewers
    - not to show a realistic look into the future.\r\n\r\nIf one thinks about it,
    as technology improves, better options become available. So business letters went
    from monospaced typewriting to (in a few cases) proportional-spaced characters
    with a 1/32\" unit from an IBM Executive typewriter to proportional-spaced characters
    with a 1/60\" unit from a daisywheel to typeset (if poorly) text in real typefaces
    like Times Roman from a laser printer.\r\n\r\nSo the future might not see Caslon
    and Garamond all over the place - but type would be very readable and visually
    appealing. Instead of Microgramma and Stop and Amelia, if one still wanted something
    that looked a little \"futuristic\"... Optima might be an option for the visual
    look of a science-fiction TV show.\r\n\r\nBut in the real world, Baskerville would
    be likelier. Or Goudy Old Style. But a present-day audience just wouldn't react
    to that the way makers of a sci-fi movie or TV show need.\r\n\r\nI wish they would
    add small caps to ASCII as a third case like upper and lower case, and put an
    extra key on the keyboards, but right now Unicode is dead set against that...
    so I see that as a serious roadblock. (In fact, making italics and bold separate
    characters instead of stylistic variants would help make it much easier for those
    variants to be used by ordinary software: but the chance of that seems to be nil.)"

    know small caps, or italics? One of the big reasons for Unicode, as far as I understand,
    was to end the Latino-centeredness in computing. Accomodating typographic traditions
    of each script wasn't really (though yes, one might ask why uppercase and lowercase
    deserve a distinction, then).\r\n\r\nI think the discussion has to include other
    scripts and languages, and it has to include the screen as the new medium on which
    the glyphs appear, no?\r\n\r\nPS: Concerning Small Caps, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/fontmag/002/02_atma/\">this

  body: The giant  leaps for mankind in typography have already happened.  We will
    continue an endless series of hop-skip-and-jumps until such a time as language
    will be conveyed by thought planting systems which will replace phones, TV and
    the movies. The internet will be a wifi world where we send thoughts to each other
    via our virtual "connectivity" to acquire knowledge, get entertainment, and communicate
    without ever leaving our own mind.  So enjoy type while it lasts, soon it will
    only be seen in virual museaums ;-)

  body: "I have always preferred small caps that are substantially larger than x-height.\r\nSmall
    caps that are the same size or similar to x-height are too problematic for short
    acronyms, and historically worked best when tracked out in a way that doesn't
    work today, when text is set tight with lots of kerning.\r\n\r\nSo I think that
    two kinds of face accommodate acronyms:\r\n\r\n1. Those with small x height and
    small caps that are much larger, but still not as big as caps.\r\n2. Those with
    large x-height and short capitals, generally with ascenders that overshoot cap
    height: no need for small caps.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that if one is designing
    a typeface for Latin and Cyrillic (and many fonts today are multi-script), and
    providing uniform features across scripts, then a small-cap height notably larger
    than x-height is a good idea, because that's a necessity for Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nFor
    figure styles, it seems to me that Quark and InDesign have provided the \"pull\"
    for multiple figure styles, by showing the four major variants in the OpenType
    palette (the implication being that having all four in a font is the default),
    and OpenType itself has provided the \"push\", by making it possible to include
    multiple variants in a single font.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just responding to user
    needs, it's more of a technology/marketplace-driven dynamic.\r\n"

  body: Greta Text is indeed representative of something I think worthwhile. As Corona
    or Aurora are based on a more mainstream category of typeface (Century Expanded
    as against Weiss Roman or Palatino) from the provincial North American point of
    view, I'm surprised they haven't been taken up already...

  body: "> many acronyms are not only no longer \r\n> unique but have many possible
    meanings\r\n\r\nTrue, although in English there have always been many homophones
    (words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings), such as  to/too/two
    and caret/carrot, but that hasn't stopped people from using those words, because
    the meaning is generally obvious from the context. But I agree it can be confusing
    at times.\r\n\r\nAs for small caps for acronyms, my general impression (perhaps
    wrong) is that they are mostly used in publications that have a more sophisticated
    use of typography, but are seldom used in more \"everyday\" typesetting (business
    communications, newspapers, websites, and so forth).  "
