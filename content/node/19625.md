  body: "> <em>what does calling the \u201Clookup rotate;\u201D thing do?</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of code, what it does is \"makes a call\" to the lookup defined above, which
    means that each 'sub' is \"ran\" again. <em>Again</em> because this part of the
    code\r\n<code>\r\nlookup rotate {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub @set_2
    @set_1' by @set_3;\r\nsub @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1' by @set_5;\r\nsub
    @set_5 @set_1' by @set_1;\r\n} rotate;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nnot only defines the
    lookup, but also \"runs\" each 'sub' included in it.\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of result, the line \u201Clookup rotate;\u201D does nothing, really. If
    you analyze step by step what the code does, here's how it goes:\r\n\r\n<strong>A.</strong>
    Let's consider a word with 10 letters as the input. Each of these letters have
    their default glyph, represented by \"1\", and four alternates glyphs, represented
    by \"2\", \"3\", \"4\" and \"5\". In the beginning, all those letters are taking
    their default glyph shape, since no feature is applied. So, our 10-letter word
    looks like this, <strong>1111111111</strong> (where \"1\" represents the default
    glyph of each letter).\r\n\r\n<strong>B.</strong> After going through the first
    'sub' (<code>sub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;</code>), our word now looks like this,
    <strong>1212121212</strong>, where \"2\" represents the first alternate glyph.
    What the code does here is replace the second default glyph (in a pair) by the
    alternate glyph.\r\n\r\n<strong>C.</strong> The second 'sub' changes the displayed
    word to <strong>1231231231</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>D.</strong> The third 'sub'
    changes it to <strong>1234123412</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>E.</strong> The fourth
    'sub' changes it to <strong>1234512345</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>F.</strong> And
    the fifth and last 'sub' (<code>sub @set_5 @set_1' by @set_1;</code>) does nothing,
    because it's replacing the default glyph (a.k.a. \"1\") by itself.\r\n\r\n<strong>G.</strong>
    Then the call to the 'rotate' lookup does nothing as well, because at this stage
    our word doesn't have any two default glyphs next to each other (i.e. \"11\").
    Neither the first alternate (\"2\") appears followed by the default glyph (\"1\").
    And so on...\r\n\r\nBottom line, Pieter's code can be further reduced to just,\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
    salt {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub @set_2 @set_1' by @set_3;\r\nsub
    @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1' by @set_5;\r\n} salt;\r\n</code>"

    you could have added a few more substitutions including the 'space' glyph in the
    context, like this:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature calt {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub

  body: "> <em>is it relevant whether you pack the substitutions into the contextual
    alternates or the stylistic alternates feature?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. The [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#salt|Stylistic
    Alternates (salt)]] feature should only contain one-to-one substitutions (GSUB
    lookup type 1) or one-from-many substitutions (GSUB lookup type 3), whereas the
    \ [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#calt|Contextual
    Alternates (calt)]] feature is meant to only contain contextual substitutions
    (GSUB lookup type 6). In other words, don't put contextual substitutions in 'salt',
    and one-to-one or one-from-many substitutions in 'calt'. Applications expect that
    the features in the font are constructed according to the specs, so you might
    not get the desired behavior if you don't follow them. (Disclaimer: some feature
    descriptions are not as clear as they needed to be, so some OT layout implementations
    might slightly differ.)\r\n\r\n> <em>The more semantically correct would be salt,
    I believe,</em>\r\n\r\nI disagree, but I think I understand why you say so. Think
    of 'calt' as the contextual version of 'salt' (which is similar to the relationship
    between [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#swsh|swsh]]
    and [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#cswh|cswh]]).
    If you apply 'salt' to a whole block of text, you might see wired things like
    this,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/salt_4723.png]\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, if you instead apply 'calt' to the same block of text, you might get
    this result instead,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calt_4367.png]\r\n\r\n(Of
    course, this assumes that the font has the right substitutions in the right features
    and the application has support for them and  applies them correctly.)\r\n\r\nTo
    get the 'calt' result \"automatically\", the feature and the substitutions have
    to rely on the context. In the case above, all glyphs with a finial variant are
    being replaced whenever they are <strong>positioned at the end of the word</strong>
    (this is the context), but not when they appear elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> <em>because
    the characters are not replaced in relation to their neighbours but simply by
    their order of appearance.</em>\r\n\r\nAnd how do you determine their order of
    appearance? Don't you have to analyze what's around, and therefore \"look\" at
    the context?\r\n\r\nI should add that the result displayed in the 'calt' picture
    can also be achieved by using the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#fina|Terminal
    Forms (fina)]] feature. In this case the code of the feature is much simpler (see
    below), because the task of deciding when to apply the glyph substitution is left
    to the application. Unfortunately, very few applications support the 'fina' feature.
    (InDesign CS3 does)\r\n\r\n<code>@ALL_LETTERS = [a-z A-Z];\r\n@FINAL = [a.fina
    t.fina];\r\n@NORMAL = [a t];\r\n\r\nfeature fina {\r\nsub @NORMAL by @FINAL;\r\n}
    fina;\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nignore sub @NORMAL' [@ALL_LETTERS @FINAL];\r\nsub
    @NORMAL' by @FINAL;\r\n} calt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAs you see, to get the effect
    of the 'fina' feature via the 'calt' feature, the code get's more complex. This
    is because using the 'calt' feature we have to put the \"intelligence\" in the
    font, whereas using the 'fina' feature we can rely on the application's \"intelligence\"."

    is more related with the fact that 1) when <code>ignore sub(stitute)</code> is

    rule (i.e. the <code>ignore sub</code> rule) to affect the rules that follow it,
    2) they all must be of the same type so that they are put in the same lookup ([[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#4.e|A
    lookup is a group of rules of the same type]]). Since the exception will of type
    GSUB LookupType 6, the following rules need to be expressed in the same type,
    and that's achieved by marking the sequence.

  body: "[While I was writing, Miguel has already answered the question ...]\r\n\r\nThe
    <em>ignore</em> statement does a nice trick when writing GSUB or GPOS tables.
    I'll try a simplified (so not entirely correct) description:\r\n\r\nIn the compiled
    font's GSUB table, the \"main\" lookup for this <em>calt</em> feature will not
    only contain a subtable listing all the substitutions (here <em>\"sub @NORMAL
    by @FINAL;\"</em>), but also an additional subtable ahead of it. This additional
    subtable will list affected glyphs and their contexts (here <em>\"@NORMAL' [@ALL_LETTERS
    @FINAL]\"</em>) but no instructions about what to do with them. It does nothing,
    actually -- the sole purpose of this subtable is to \"catch\" all contexts listed
    in the <em>ignore</em> statement.\r\nLayout engines follow the rule that if a
    glyph or glyph sequence has been consumed by a subtable, then all following subtables
    will be skipped for this glyph or glyph sequence. So the trick works like this:
    If the <em>ignore</em> context is matched for a glyph: substitutions for this
    glyph, as defined in the following subtable, will not be executed (they will be
    ignored). If the <em>ignore</em> context is not matched: substitutions for this
    glyph, defined in the following subtable, will be executed.\r\n\r\n(And to make
    sure that the real substitutions will go into the same lookup as the mere \"context
    catchers\" -- although into different subtables -- they must be of the same lookup
    type. Which is achieved by defining <em>\"sub @NORMAL' by @FINAL;\"</em> in pseudo-contextual
    form, as Miguel explained.)\r\n\r\nVOLT's <em>EXCEPT</em> does about the same
    thing, AFAIK."

    is rather long-winded, as it has to be done separately for every character one

    each. (In practice, this may only be necessary for the most noticeably different

    Nick: For longer passages of text (i.e., temporarily setting aside your \"this
    is the way the men think\" example), wouldn't cycling sets of vowels be a better
    method of changing the most frequently occurring letters? \r\n\r\nFine, it mightn't
    be ideal with transliterated Serbian ;)  \r\n\r\nStill, curiosity heightens: how
    could one order such cycling vowel lookups <em>and</em> the larger calt sets (viz.,
    the numbered sets you've used above) to work neatly together? Or is the assumption
    that it could be done in itself a leap too large?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nErnie\r\n"

    does significantly in IDCS2 on a 10.3.9 driven G4 PowerBook. The fonts tested

  body: "Oops, you're right about the prime marks - let's consider that a minor typo.
    ;) I'll make sure that is fixed for final use.\r\n\r\nAbove, Nick suggested the
    pattern of \"12345 21453 24135\" and I am just trying to figure out if I have
    the 'replacement cycle' correct.\r\n\r\nLet me re-state the process of replacement
    for clarity, as I see it happening - please let me know if I'm getting off the
    rails anywhere:\r\n\r\nThe glyphs are split into sets; the primary set (<code>@set_1</code>
    [A-Z, a-z, 0-9, etc.]), and four other 'alternate' sets of the same glyphs you
    wish to be swapped out; sets <code>@set_2</code> through <code>@set_5</code>.\r\n\r\nThe
    glyphs start out as: 11111 11111 11111\r\n\r\nAfter the first lookup, the glyphs
    are then: 12345 12345 12345\r\n\r\nThen, the second lookup does this sequence,
    line by line;\r\n12345 12345 12345 - start\r\n12345 22345 12345 - lookup 2 line
    1\r\n12345 21345 12345 - lookup 2 line 2\r\n12345 21445 12345 - lookup 2 line
    3\r\n12345 21455 12345 - lookup 2 line 4\r\n12345 21453 12345 - lookup 2 line
    5\r\n12345 21453 22345 - lookup 2 line 6\r\n12345 21453 24345 - lookup 2 line
    7\r\n12345 21453 24145 - lookup 2 line 8\r\n12345 21453 24135 - lookup 2 line
    9\r\n\r\nThen the sequence should look like: 12345 21453 24135, as Nick suggested.\r\n\r\nI
    just wanted to make sure I have the theory correct, and the cycle will act as
    predicted. Thus, if expanded to six sets, I know what the sequence should do.
    Sorry for the long-winded explanation, and I hope I was clear enough. Thanks for
    any help.\r\n\r\n"

    I just wanted someone to check my code, to make sure it would work properly.\r\n\r\nI
    never expected two of the pioneers of this subject to answer. I'm humbled.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I finally had a chance to check out the code in FLS5, and discovered that it stopped
    subbing glyphs in the middle of the second set (where I have subsequently placed
    the third lookup break), and in order for it to complete all of the substitutions,
    I needed to split the code into the three lookups shown below.\r\n\r\nHere is
    the code:\r\n<pre>feature calt { # Contextual Alternates\r\n# Latin\r\nlookup

    @set_2 @set_1 @set_3' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_4' by @set_5;\r\nsub @set_5
    @set_5' by @set_3;\r\n} calt_two;\r\n\r\nlookup calt_three {\r\nsub @set_5 @set_3
    @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub @set_3 @set_2 @set_2' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_2 @set_4
    @set_3' by @set_1;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1 @set_4' by @set_3;\r\n} calt_three;\r\n}
    calt;</pre>\r\n\r\nHere are my results (spaces are demarcated with a bar above
    the number):\r\n\r\n[EDIT]: I should clarify the image below; I created a typeface
    with the letter glyphs replaced with numerals - \"1\" for set_1 letters, \"2\"
    for set_2 letters, etc., and again, with spaces marked with bar above. Then, when
    the <code>calt</code> code was run in FLS5, you see the following:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_4751.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to work perfectly, but does anyone have any thoughts on why the code needed
    to be separated into three blocks? Any other thoughts?\r\n\r\n"
