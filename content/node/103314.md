  body: This appears to be the title frame from a [[http://ctva.biz/UK/BBC/Drama/Colditz.htm|series
    produced by the BBC and Universal Television]] between 1972 and 1974. I don't
    know the name of the font (if it is one), but at least you can rule out anything
    designed since the early 70s. 1974 was still pre-digital, so it may have been
    handlettered; that was not unusual at that time.
