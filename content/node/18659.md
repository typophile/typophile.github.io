body: okay, so i'm making an OT font and when I use it in InDesign CS, i can access
  all the alternates in the glyph pallette with the little black arrows that show
  me all the alternates for the character. However, the same font in Illustrator doesn't
  have this same functionality. What gives?

  body: the features all work fine from the flyout menu, but i want the glyphs to
    be accessbile through the glyph pallette as well via the above mentioned method.

  body: whew! I think i figgered it out. i guess i was opperating under the dangerous
    assumption that FLab was doing everything for me, but the aalt feature seems to
    be the culprit. I assumed that this was built automatically by FontLab (and it
    seems that it is) as all i had to do to fix the problem was to write the aalt
    feature manually, including all the other substitution features.
