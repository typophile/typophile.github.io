  font to use! I wanted to use Old English but I didn't like the \"y\" because of
  the tail. My friend also commented that Old English is like the Times New Roman
  of Blackletter, not something that I'd want.\r\n\r\nI'm not good with fonts so perhaps
  you guys can give me a few suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\np/s: I'm
  getting the quote \"Glory comes from daring to begin\"."
