  a guy and he recommended \r\nan excellent book on brush calligraphy - which I have
  since forgotten. I would ask\r\nhim but it was a crazy halloween fancy dress party
  and I don't know who he was.\r\n\r\nSo, would anyone be kind enough to suggest one
  (or more) instead?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nG\r\n\r\n"

    by Edward Catich from the library today. It's not a how-to, but it looks like
    it gives an good overview of brush writing through Roman inscriptions. Catich
    also wrote a companion piece devoted entirely to Trajan's Column.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps,\r\nDavid"

    with me an a pirate. \r\nThere was a 7 piece Jazz band in the lounge and some
    guy crowdsurfed in and onto the sofa. \r\n\r\nThe whole place was completely rammed
    with mad loooking scary people and fake blood all over the walls.\r\n\r\nwe ended
    up leavin at 6 in the morning with a garden gnome and a beach ball singing \"i
    am the lord of the dance said he\" on a night bus.\r\n\r\nit was ridiculous.\r\n\r\nGraham"
