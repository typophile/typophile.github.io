  Vista and it works pretty well in many of my designs (books, mostly). I wonder if
  pairing it with Malaga would be a good idea - I like Dupre's newest font a lot and
  I am probably going to buy it anyway, but I would like to know something about this
  particular aspect.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nPrzemek Debowski"

    together you should have a third to make sure the mix isn''t too homogenous. '

  body: "Thank you for your help. \"Too homogenous\" - this is exactly the expression
    I was looking for, for I was a bit afraid that the typefaces may be in fact too
    similar to each other. Mixing them with yet another one seems like a good idea,
    I will never know, till I try. <sigh>. Let's see, where is my credit card?\r\n\r\nPrzemek

  body: I wish Malaga had the Alternates package that Vista has, I am not a fan of
    the squared off 'a' that is so popular at Emigre, and Vista gives you an alternate
    single story a.
