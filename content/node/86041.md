body: "For those of you who might not be following the Adobe Max conference right
  now, they announced this morning that Adobe has acquired Typekit!\r\n\r\nFrom Typekit
  CEO Jeffrey Veen's announcement email:\r\n\r\n\"Just a few moments ago, Adobe\u2019s
  CTO Kevin Lynch took the stage at their annual MAX conference and explained the
  company\u2019s Creative Cloud strategy. Part of that announcement is very big news
  for us: Typekit has been acquired by Adobe.\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled. There honestly
  is no better place for us to continue building our platform. But perhaps even more
  significantly, this represents a huge step forward in bringing fonts to the web...\r\n\r\n...
  If you\u2019re one of our customers, this announcement means things will only get
  better. Typekit will remain a standalone product, as well as become a vital part
  of Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud. Our team will stay together, and we\u2019re excited
  to start working on even easier ways to integrate web fonts into your workflow.\r\n\r\nFrom
  the start, our vision has been to make the web more beautiful, readable, and fast.
  Joining Adobe will give us the opportunity to do that at an even larger scale. This
  news doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve crossed the finish line. Actually, we\u2019ve
  really only just completed the first lap. The race to improve the web will only
  get faster. I hope you\u2019re enjoying the ride.\"\r\n\r\nOfficial Press Release

  body: OK, I'll bite . . . Big news, absolutely! But, does it really change anything
    for font makers? Adobe hasn't been in the font distribution business of 3rd party
    fonts since, 1990s?

    lots of 3rd party fonts under deals they struck in the 90s.)"
