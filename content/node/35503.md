  my example, I am referring to the words '2nd edition'. At first I thought this was
  an actual typeface, but I can see the differences between the two 'i' letters now,
  so perhaps it was hand drawn. Anyway - I like this style of script because it looks
  quite modern, and not too feminine. So does anyone know of anything existing with
  a similar feel? Sorry it\u2019s a pretty small image.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n"

    Italic</a>. However that inital 'e' looks more like an 'l' (ell). You can find
    many other handwritten font styles in Parts 9 and 10 of the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>, if you are looking for natural-looking handwriting fonts.\r\n\r\n-
