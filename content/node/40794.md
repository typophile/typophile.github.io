body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo at the moment and I'm looking for some
  nice g's. It will have to be a double storey g preferably a minimalistic look. But
  any double story g will do as long as it's one that is a bit different or has something
  quirky.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to adapt a double storey g to a mark for the company
  so that's why I'm just curious about g's that are out there. It's just one idea
  and already have a few little sketches for other logo styles to propose, but I'd
  like to see some more g's and perhaps I can make something nice of that.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ndav.\r\n\r\nbtw.
  I just found another thread about the double storey g at typophile.\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/17647\r\n"
