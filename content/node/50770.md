  body: "With Word you can't get what I would consider flawless. You can only get
    \"good\" enough.\r\n\r\nMake sure your image has at least 150 ppi resolution (this
    will look good enough on most business printers but if you need better quality
    though larger file size, make it 300 ppi). Save the image as a Word acceptable
    graphic (PNG. JPG, etc.) Place the image in Word. And then double-click the image
    and reset it's width and height at 100%. You'll also want to arrange the logo
    image behind the text or in a way that won't interfere with actually using the
    document template to write with (when you double-click the image you can see a
    tab about Word-wrap for options on that). Then print and make adjustments as necessary
    until you get a result that you and your client approve of.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    be layered then you might consider converting to TTF.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
