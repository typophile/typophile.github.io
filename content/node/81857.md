    maybe those as well (apologies to the designers):\r\n\r\nWarnock \u2013 bundled
    with Adobe quite often, check if you have it\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/warnock/\r\n\r\nTierra
    Nueva, maybe the script face\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/fdi-tierra-nueva/\r\n\r\nEdita\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/edita/\r\n\r\n\r\nOr

    or sarcastic: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/thinkdust/lippy/|Lippy]]. Even [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/mistral/|Mistral]]
    could be an option, or a mono-spaced typewriter font, which assumes authority,
    like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/|this one]]
    or any other.'
