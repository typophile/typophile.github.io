  sizes. I'm wondering if there was a minimum size that people use to test logos,
  for example, if it's still readable at 10mm wide it will be fine. What do other
  people do? \r\nI hope this makes sense, it does in my head but then...\r\nthankyou\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: I don't know specifics, but I always hear people say that a logo should work
    at sizes between a business card and a billboard. I honestly can't imagine a logo
    being much smaller than 1 cm (or even often being seen at that size), as you described;
    I'd think that if it's readable that small, that's incredibly good.

  body: "Thanks Reed,\r\n\r\nMy worst-case scenario I have in mind is the cluster
    of sponsor logos you often see at the bottom of a brochure or flier or program,
    in your experience do these get smaller than say 15mm?\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: How small will it need to get, and where will it be seen? This is really relative,
    so as much as possible we test logos in their final environments and worst case
    scenarios. For a film production company we tested movement at small reversed
    sizes at screen res (ie as seen at the end of film credits), for an electrical
    engineer we tested etched in metal at around 10mm across.

  body: Unfortunately, Nicholas, I don't have very much experience to speak of. My
    gut feeling is that if you're thinking this much about clarity, it shouldn't be
    much of a problem in the end. The things I know you need to watch out for are
    little details that could get blurry or filled up when scaled down. If your logo
    has a lot of fine details, then it might be a good idea to make a simplified version
    for use in these difficult circumstances. Hope this is helpful; maybe someone
    else has more concrete knowledge.

  body: "Good rule of thumb on the pen -- but I think you have to consider resolution/quality/colour
    issues as well.\r\n\r\nBusiness cards are generally the smallest full colour litho
    application, but very high print resolution so rarely any problems.\r\n\r\nPens
    the smallest print application, generally screen printed in 1 or 2 solid colours,
    potential for ink spread.\r\n\r\nYou should check how it prints at likely sizes
    on low resolution devices - colour and b/w laser prints. Fax, although dying out,
    should be at least considered.\r\n\r\nThen there are web graphics and perhaps
    application icons. I remember having to make a logo work on an early WAP phone
    - tiny screen, no greyscale let alone colour."

  body: "Cool thanks,\r\n\r\nThis has all been very useful. My logo has quite a few
    fine details (points) that might present some problems at *very* small sizes.
    I'm thinkng the best thing is to make another version for very small sizes with
    simplified detail and heavier text or something. The disposable pen thing scares
    me frankly ;)\r\nthanks so much for all your help\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"
