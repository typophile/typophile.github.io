body: "So yes, I am a Harry Potter nerd.  I have read them all at least twice, but
  I digress-That is not the point of this entry.  Anyway, I thought that the cover
  designers really did a great job with this last book.  This pictures show both the
  American book cover (above) and the English book cover (below).  I think the American
  one really fits the book better just because it looks more unrealistic.  I like
  the way they've echoed Harry's lightning bolt scar in the font too.  I think the
  colors work really well together and really catch someone's eye as they walk by.
  \ The English one just doesn't remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess it just looks
  more serious or something to me...I mean, it's well designed, I'm just not sure
  it fits the book in question.  What do you think? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book_harry7_3902.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/harry-potter_5492.jpg]"
