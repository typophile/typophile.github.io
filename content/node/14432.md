  body: "I think with the distortion and effects added to it and given the base character
    you are going to be fortunate to get a certain i.d. In fact given the junction
    it could even be created from scratch. Do you have any other more distinctive
    samples?\r\nTim"

  body: Seriously, Ng Swee, it's quite unlikely we're going to be able to ID this
    typeface with just one number 8 -- which is <em>not</em> a distinctive character
    -- that's been extruded, bevelled, slanted <em>and</em> shaded. :^)
