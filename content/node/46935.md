    rather static and rigid. Nothing is really pulling me in."

  body: "If it was up to me, I would've colored the roofs bright red. Other than that,
    think scale: 'luxury' - much larger, that comma is a disaster (closer and smaller).
    There are kerning issues in the title. 'Lifestyle & location': either bring it
    closer to the top line or give it an oversized pretty ampersand, maybe a color
    accent on the ampersand. I think it was Philip Stark who said that helvetica/(arial)
    when used as small paragraph text looks like shit. Try Arno maybe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\uF8FF"

  body: "to me, to best say 'luxury' in a newspaper is to be subtle. Say less, add
    more whitespace.\r\n\r\nDo you need both elevations? The back doesn't seem remarkably
    different than the front.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, maybe give the front more
    emphasis in scale and the back less.\r\n\r\nMaybe consider a script face?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    where's the URL? ;o)\r\n"

  body: "I was confused by the front and rear elevations. I didn't know the rear was
    rear until Aluminum mentioned it. Maybe the rear is anamorphically stretched?
    It looks taller and narrower than the front. \r\n\r\nI agree about the whitespace,
    too. More would be good."

  body: "Here are my rough thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe headline needs more spacing help,
    but I think dropping the rear elevation, enlarging the front, adding white space,
    and aligning the layout a bit more on a grid (at least horizontally) are possible
    improvements you might consider.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/architect_illust_5939-max_5806.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys, I'm here to learn...\r\n\r\nI might have a rethink.\r\nIt seems
    it just going to be used on a display board at the development site, and maybe
    an A0 poster. \r\n\r\nTheir branding is in eurostile, does it matter if eurostile
    isn't used anywhere else, or it ends up with three typefaces being used? at the
    moment i've got helvetica and didot, and their branding in eurostile \r\n"

    to a script type, and maybe another warm color?? Just thinking loud... "

  body: "Is that the only image they supplied you with? That doesn't scream luxury
    to me at all. The blues make this very cold; it's almost mono-chromatic...when
    I think of a luxury home I think of warmth; something inviting. It's also very
    flat...it seems there could be more depth.  I also agree with ZUZ3L and tina's
    suggestion of a script font or possibly something clean and modern.\r\n\r\nCould
    you possibly work in smaller photographs of the inside of one of these luxury
    homes?"
