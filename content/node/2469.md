  with a bicameral &#34;g&#34;? <BR>Any typeface that does it? <BR>Thanks.

  body: I can&#39;t remember of any, but I really think you should try it &#40;if
    you&#39;re willing to&#41;, since the opposite &#40;monocameral &#39;g&#39; and
    bicameral &#39;a&#39;&#41; is quite common...

    Tarzana</a> does. Tarzana roman &#40;no slant&#41; is inspired by its own italics,
    with an italic style cap E and some other less formal traits to match. <BR> <BR>In
    traditional serif faces the italic a will do just that &#40;while the accompanying
    roman will have both stacked forms of a and g&#41;. It has more to do with staying
    true to italics. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say, just do what works, but make sure you have
    good reasoning that can help you drive other decisions about the face as its developed.
    Both the stacked a and the stacked g offer more interesting flexibility, in terms
    of letting you push the personality of a face. Then again, as with Futura, the
    single-story a and g both add to it&#39;s rationalized lack of personality.
