  I'm the co-author of a monograph about typographer and designer Will Burtin, published
  by Lund Humphries (London) and Ashgate (New York) (September, 2007). To read good
  reviews of \"Design and Science: the work and life of Will Burtin\" (NYT Sunday
  Review of Books, June 1 2008) and by the British design writer, Rick Poynor, check
  out my URL RobertFripp.ca > Menu: Design and Science.  In the interests of full
  disclosure i should add: Will was my father-in-law.\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nRobert
