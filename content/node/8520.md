body: I have this font which I thought was a pixel font &#40;04, uni, etc.&#41; But
  those are not matching up exactly. I Believe in should be fairly easy to identify.
  Any help is appreciated. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/57380.gif"

    I can&#39;t find a full character map, but the A, D, and E match exactly. <BR>

  body: I think you are right - although both fonts have the exact same ABCDEF. The
    other letters match Standard 07 65 exactly, as does the spacing. <BR> <BR> - Lex
