  body: There's not much to say about it, you've overall delivered a good job. The
    axis of the /c/ is too upright and the top left of /s/ needs a bit of tweaking.
    Most of the ball terminals are also too light. I was expecting to see more of
    the terminals of the roman in the italics, but i guess this also works good.
