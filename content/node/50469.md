  Isle\"\r\nFound Here:\r\nhttp://farm1.static.flickr.com/124/366438290_900397336e_o.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso
  if anyone can identify \"The Best Ship Loading!\" font as well. In fact if anyone
  knows who made these fonts back in the 19th Century, I'd be very interested.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

  body: It is most likely a wooden typeface that hasn't been digitized. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/2rebels/vintage_gothic_regular/">Vintage
    Gothic</a> is almost the sans version of it.

  body: BEST SHIP LOADING is probably a Hellenic Wide or Antique Extended. Best version
    I know is <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000096">Jason
    Walcott's</a> but there are also variations by Nathan Williams (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/baseline/58_rodeo/">58
    Rodeo</a>) and Erik van Blokland (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_zapata/">FF
    Zapata</a>.

  body: I see, thank you. Is there anyway to find out which wooden typeface or is
    it lost in time?
