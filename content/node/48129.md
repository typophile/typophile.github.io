  here : \r\n\r\nhttp://shinymedia.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dc_new_zealand.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
  definately not Eurostile.  The closest I could come up with was LTC's Octic Gothic
  Two ( http://www.p22.com/lanston/octicgothic.html ), but the R, S and others are
  different.\r\n\r\nIt's been bugging me for quite a while.\r\n\r\nAnyone else willing
  to take a stab?"
