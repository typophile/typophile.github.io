  body: "From the Fontlab Ltd. perspective: \r\n\r\nFontographer is quite simple,
    easy to use for people who have learned it well, and very reliable (on Mac --
    the Windows version did not age so well). However, the current version is a bit
    dated, produces poor-quality TrueType fonts and no OpenType fonts, so it's only
    good for making Western Type 1 fonts (but it is really very good at doing that).
    \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio is more complex, a bit less reliable. Version 5 is also
    reasonable easy to use given its complexity. People who have taken the time to
    learn the switch from Fontographer to FontLab Studio can work in it as fast, or
    sometimes even faster. Currently, the great advantage of FontLab Studio is its
    user community: you will find many tips and tricks here on Typophile or on the
    <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/\">FontLab forum</a>, and most of the
    professional type designers use FontLab Studio. The <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/Typographic-Resources/Font-Typography-Books/Learn-FontLab-Fast/\">Leslie
    Cabarga</a> book combined with the official FontLab Studio manual give you quite
    good documentation. And of course, FontLab Studio allows you to produce not only
    Type 1 fonts, but industry-strong TrueType and OpenType fonts. \r\n\r\nFontlab
    Ltd. is working on new versions of both Fontographer and FontLab Studio, and I
    cannot at this point tell you much about them, other than that we intend to develop
    both lines of products. \r\n\r\nIf you compare Fontlab Ltd. applications to Apple's
    sound editing applications, then TypeTool is GarageBand, Fontographer is Logic
    Express and FontLab Studio is Logic Pro. Oh, and AsiaFont Studio is Logic Pro
    with all possible plugins ;) \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nThanks. I am doing well with fontographer. Creating my second
      type face. Have fixed the spacebar issue I had (with help from William in another
      forum here). I am doing well with my kerning pairs so far. Not sure when I will
      check out FontLab. But thanks so much for your help.\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: "OH boy...here we go again...things are going well with kerning pairs in fontographer.\r\n\r\nNow
    I want to creating kerning with upper and lower case. It seems when I choose next
    character the program moves onto the next character inthe order not the next one
    to kern...\r\n\r\nIs there a way to select all and create pairs automatically?\r\n\r\nRichard"
