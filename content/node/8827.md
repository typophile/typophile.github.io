  body: I&#39;ve been trying to find one of these for a while myself. Like Tiffany
    said, <a href="http://www.vojousoftware.com/products.html#xfi">X Font Info</a>
    is useful if you have a few fonts to preview, and for previewing larger collections,
    there&#39;s <a href="http://www.pidog.com/fontthing/">FontThing</a> &#40;although
    piDog&#39;s site appears to be down right now&#41;. It bears repeating that I
    haven&#39;t found a font previewing app for Mac OS X that handles corrupt font
    files gracefully, and all of them fail to work for sometimes inexplicable reasons.
    That said, I&#39;ve tried most everything out there, and these two are the best.
