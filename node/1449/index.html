		<div class="commentbody">I rather enjoyed Gerry Leonidas&#39; talk, John Hudson&#39;s new Hebrew face, Gerald Cinamon&#39;s Koch slides &#40;lots of stuff not in the book&#41;, the House of Downer demo, everything really. I only regret not being able to be in three places at once for some of those presentations. I really wanted to see more. That&#39;s probably the best complaint they can get. <BR> <BR>The food, well... I guess I understand now why I&#39;ve never heard of one going out to a Canadian restaurant. I preferred Leipzig. If I weren&#39;t allergic to seafood, I might have enjoyed the food more. <BR> <BR>So now that it&#39;s Monday, check out the announcement from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hate to start w/ a negative, but the worst thing for me at the conference were the name tags! I found them difficult to read further than 2-3 feet away. I&#39;m naturally shy and intimidated by crowds, and I find it very difficult to walk up to people and say: &#34;Hi! Who are you?&#34; I would have liked to have met more people from the on-line forums ... oh, well. Next time. <BR> <BR>For me, the best talk was the Kevin Larson/Gerald Unger combination re: Word Recognition &amp; Legibility. Lots of good information, I&#39;m just sorry hhp wasn&#39;t there to cross swords w/ Kevin :o&#41; I also thought the font business series was good. <BR> <BR>Vancouver is beautiful, and the weather was fantastic. It was very difficult to stay indoors; more than once I was tempted to steal a sailboat, head West &amp; keep on going. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Over sushi with Cyrus, I was complaining &#40;as is my wont&#41; of the stale state of typography in mass market magazines available at airports, but mentioned that there was one exception, but I couldn&#39;t remember the magazine name or identify the headline font, so I drew him a couple of characters. &#34;Oh, was that Natural Health?&#34; says Cyrus, &#34;That&#39;s the first issue and a new face I just designed.&#34; <BR> <BR>6. Best quote? &#34;The choice of type is based on reputation and trends, rather than any kind of logic.&#34; - Roger Black</div>

Such a talent! And  very nice guy as well. <BR> <BR>And to top it off, I always enjoy hanging around the False Creek waterway. <BR> <BR>The disappointing part is that I managed to meet very few type designers, and would have liked to have had the time to get peole to visit my own metal foundry. <BR> <BR>All in all, I had a nice time, and wasn&#39;t completely put off the conference on by the doubtful quality of the red wine. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">PowerPoint is actually a great program to write and put together a presentation as a structured document. It&#39;s how people use it that makes it a bad thing. The slide sorter view is really good, as well as the outline mode. InDesign doesn&#39;t compare when it comes to this. Try organizing your pages in the pages palette. It&#39;s a nightmere. <BR> <BR>Though I still do my presentations in InDesign and present in Acrobat. That&#39;s what I did for mine at ATypI. Can&#39;t do without the typographic sophistication. No kerning? Forget it! I&#39;m tempted to try Keynote. Would any of you recomment it? I&#39;ve noticed a few presenters used Keynote. I love the cinematic cross-dissolve!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John: <BR>I don&#39;t think PowerPoint can take PDF as an import format. However, if you have Acrobat 6 Pro, you can export PDF from PowerPoint and have it even map transitions to their closest PDF equivalents. I haven&#39;t played with this much, since I think fancy transitions are often a distraction, so I can&#39;t say how well it works. <BR> <BR>Keith: <BR>I agree wholeheartedly that PowerPoint is great for managing structured presentations. That&#39;s why I still use it even though the typography sucks so badly. However, when time allows I do the initial version in PowerPoint and then redo it all in InDesign when I&#39;m done.... <BR> <BR>T</div>
