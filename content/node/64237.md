  body: "I spent a lot of time looking for RAM, and I wonder what is the source of
    these? Do we know that they are fonts? \r\n\r\nAs far as the Korinna U, there
    have been versions of Korinna (usually by other names), where the U is like the
    one you showed above. I suspect that's because the original U was a bit too strange
    (archaic) looking to whoever was planning to sell these copied and renamed versions.
    Image Club once had something they called ITC Korinna, but the lighter weight
    had the standard U as you showed, while the bold had the U with the left side
    curved inward. Some of the 'cloned' bargain font sets just took a font and bolded
    and/or slanted it to create a new weight. We've all seen them.\r\n\r\n  - Mike

    The R leg has an odd shape, curving down, but slightly outward. There isn't much
    else to look for, unless you have more letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    in one of the heavier weights? Now the R seems like it has a hint of flip on the
    bottom of the leg. The C is quite closed, and so is the S. The more letters we
    have, the better.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well, I was assuming that some detail is lost in translation with silk screening.
    All of the edges of your sample letters seem sort of blunted. I thought perhaps
    the sharpness of the R tail flip would also be lost/blurred and subject to some
    ink bleed on the fabric.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
