body: "The HapticScript family is a connected brush script with a warm, personal and
  soft character. The typeface family has five styles from Light through Black. It
  was designed as a companion and extension to the Haptic sans-serif family.\r\n\r\nHapticScript
  has up to 14 variations for each glyph. The almost 2,000 characters per font including
  40+ ligatures enable designers to give each word an individual look. Many swash
  characters for initials and word endings make words looks as if they were hand lettered.\r\n\r\nFive
  Styles: Light, Regular, Semibold, Bold and Black\r\n\r\nOpenType features: Ligatures,
  Contextual Alternates, Stylistic Sets, Old Style figures, Tabular figures\r\n\r\nhttp://www.henningskibbe.com/hapticscript/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/henning-skibbe/haptic-script/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_01_6483.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_02_4827.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript-word_3_6295.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_03_6053.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript-word_9_4240.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_04_5738.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript-word_15_5876.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_05_3559.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript-word_17_4850.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hapticscript_banner_06_5409.png]"
