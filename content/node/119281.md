    nil. \r\n\r\nSearch using the keyword \"Victorian\" on any free font site, but
    be aware that many of the fonts you'll find are of questionable provenance, and
    many are only free for personal--not commercial--use."

  body: "Kevin has done a good job rounding up what's available in digital format.
    \r\nAbout the only part remaining is _DE_. You can match it with Filmotype Royal
    https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/royal/\r\nBut you should know that the
    label is not composed of old time fonts as such. Rather it is hand lettering,
    probably by using lithography.\r\nFor good quality original historic fonts, at
    no charge you can go through the fonts at http://abfonts.freehostia.com/ go to
    the authors page. Check in particular Character, Claude Pelletier, Toto.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "_Eau Cologne_ and _Saigon-Hanoi_ are not the same design. Note for example
    the different _N_. For a striped font with the _N_ in _Eau Cologne_, you can use
    Archive Copperplate Head  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArchiveCopperplateHeadInUse_5607.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-copperplate-head/ which is an
    accurate, but indifferent quality, digital rendition of Hermann Ihlenburg's Copperplate
    from the 19th century. Change the convex inner curve on the terminal serifs for
    _E_, _L_, _C_, and _G_ to a concave inner curve by blanking out the unwanted part,
    and you have a fair match to _Eau Cologne_ .\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: To my eye, that style of A should be (more) optically corrected by raising
    the top a bit higher. Otherwise, it looks undersized - even in <a href='http://luc.devroye.org/IhlenbergCopperplate--in--MS+J-188.jpg'
    target='_blank'>Ihlenburg's original</a>.

  body: If you didn't notice, Don, then it's clearly not as glaring as it appears
    to me. Rather presumptuous of me to be questioning the design of someone like
    Hermann Ihlenburg, anyway.
