  body: Quite possibly not a font at all. It looks as though hand drawn. Badly, but

  body: "It has some resemblances to ITC Officina Serif, almost as if someone was
    making a crude copy of it, leaving out some serifs, and adding others. Squint
    your eyes at the screen and see if it doesn't remind you of it.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Although its letter forms are different, the straight line only treatment
    reminds me of Emigre's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/citizen/">Citizen</a>.
