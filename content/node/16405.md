  The internet community for which it's meant is all about communication between young
  people, and expressing themselves on the net. I'm also redesigning their site, but
  it all starts with the logo!\r\n\r\nI'll appreciate any comments!\r\n\r\nS\xF8ren

    look (for which a logo treatment giving it a stencil/spray paint look will be
    appropriate)\r\n\r\nb) a bubbly, dreamy look with rainbows, clouds (just stylised
    shapes, not  photographic)\r\n\r\nwhich adds up to street art hard core rapper
    meets absent minded bird loving my little pony collector. Something like that
    ;)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks!\r\n\r\n*s"

  body: "I like it!\r\n\r\nThe only problem I see is that it will read as 'ARIO' because
    the 'R' is UC and it creates the expectation that the 'TIO' is UC as well. The
    crossbar on the 't' doesn't read immediately as a crossbar. The idea is strong
    and the execution is good but needs further refinement to work."

    second. \r\n\r\nWhat if, to emphasize the talk-bubble idea, you had the letters

    make the exit part of the bubble a little larger?"

      just think it overcomplicates the logo. I might be mistaken, though...\r\n\r\nAs
      for the 4RTO, that was on purpose: I tried to make an A that looked almost like
      4, emphasising the 1337 aspect of the chat culture and so on... The exit might
      need some enlargement, though. Maybe like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artologo_04.gif]\r\n\r\nS\xF8ren

  body: I thinkt he latest version definately reads better. Just one little thing
    bugs me -- where the 'R' meets the thickened crossbar for the 't'. Smooth out
    that transition more like it was in the original, and I love it. (Just my opinion,
    though).

  body: "What I've pictured in my head doesn't match your earlier suggestion. But
    I do see what you mean. \r\n\r\nI think the quasi-traps to add air do not help
    readability though. I'd say go back to the first and rotate the A a little bit
    more -- counter-clockwise -- and go. The modulation you've added in the strokes
    doesn't feel as real or quickly written as the first."

    body: "Miss Tiffany & Engelhardt,\r\n\r\nThanks! I have made a smoother transition,
      mostly by going back to the original and narrowing the line through A and R,
      but still with a fairly thick crossline in t. The small swash at the buttom
      of the t is still there -- it might help readability, but it also subtracts
      from the vertical feel of the A, R and t lines being parallel. A bit unsure
      about that.\r\n\r\nI'm not too keen on rotating the A though. As I see it, it
      doesn't matter if the A is read as 4, just as long as you read the t as a t
      at most times. As the logo does owe a thing or two to tags, grafitti etc, ultimate
      readability is not the real goal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artologo_05.gif]\r\n\r\nS\xF8ren

  body: "This new one is definitely better. The crossbar has a more natural thick-to-thin-to-thick
    now, too. Now that Tiffany mentioned it, I can't stop seeing a 4 as well. But
    if it's not a problem for you, then stick with it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Though now that
    I'm looking at it more, i'm not so sure about the A's crossbar. It feels too narrow
    before leaving the arch of the legs. I'm staring at it too much."

  body: It looks good but as Chris said I think the crossbar in the A needs a little
    bit of refinement. It's a nice mark, just make sure that if you're going to be
    using it at all sizes that it still reads at smaller sizes (that you don't loose
    those thinner strokes in the logo type).

    if you can get a copy, look up: Fresh Styles for web designers (eye candy for
    the underground) by curt cloninger from New Riders. ISBN: 0-7357-1074-0\r\n\r\nIt
    could help give you ideas with the cloudy grafitti style. Especially look at the

  body: "Hi, I like the way the logo is progressing, however, it would be nice to
    test it without the crossing line and maybe, so that they don't get too apart,
    getting the letters closer.\r\n\r\nI think the \"communication between young people\"
    could is well expressed just by using the \"comic bubble\" and the form of the
    letters is young enough for me.\r\n\r\nJust an idea :)\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\n\r\nAlexis

      at the logo I'm beginning to feel that it has a bit more of a Comic Sans feel
      in it than I like. Not quite sure about that, but it's supposed to be -- well
      -- cool looking as well as saying communication between young people. I'm afraid
      it is getting too childish.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/comments?\r\n\r\n"

    I've remembered something like this in www.skype.com , not the same of course

    you come up with a totally different concept? I know you've invested lots of time
    in this one but sometimes when I feel I'm getting a little stuck I just drop the
    idea and start all over again, sometimes doing that allows me to come with new

    its about the content of the site. You are over thinking something the average
