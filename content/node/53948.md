  with info from last.fm - like when i love a track in last.fm, it says so on my wall
  in facebook.\r\n\r\ndoes anybody know if this is possible for fonts too?\r\n\r\nlike
  from fontshop or myfonts etc?\r\n\r\ni would love that feature! then i can share
  my fave fonts or font lusts easily...\r\n\r\ni hope it can be done...\r\n\r\nimangine
  if there was a 'love button' next to each font on a vendors website, then when i
  ticked it, it sent that info to my facebook... \r\n\r\n"

    (Beast)Master Chrisl. Today I saw that you can even throw a shoe. Do we need that
    SP-feature any longer?\r\n\r\nSimon, why don't you poke Stewf a little?"

  body: "based on their current websites, i think myfonts is the best position to
    do something likes this as it has the star rating and 'i own this font' tick box.
    if that feture could be expanded to include a 'share' button that then posts the
    font on FB and other places then that would be awesome...\r\n\r\nthe really cool
    thing about the last.fm/FB combo is that once i've put my last.fm username into
    FB it autmatically updates as i do things in last.fm so that makes it easy.\r\n\r\n"

    the top 3 sites that i see this feature most useful for are:\r\n\r\nMyFonts\r\nFontShop\r\nVeer\r\n\r\nobviously
    the small foundry sites could do it too! (hint hint jos! ;-)"
