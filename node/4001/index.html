  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Ok, I had this problem with FL3 and now it's back again with FL4. I'm running OS X. In Fog4, when you're flipping through glyphs, the left side-bearing stays put. This is a good way of judging the relative positions of different characters without drawing a bunch of guides. <BR> <BR>In FL3, and again in FL4, I flip through the glyphs, and each glyph gets centered in the glyph window. This is good/bad. However, I've noticed that *sometimes* the left side-bearing does stay put between glyphs! I noticed that there is a tiny lock icon in the ruler at the top of the side-bearings and at the end of the baseline. Does this have something to do with it? <BR> <BR>I emailed Pyrus, haven't gotten an answer yet. I know, I know, rtfm. I did (skimmed really fast looking for screenshots of that little lock). Anyone have any ideas? (now preparing to feel really stupid)</div>

I especially like the fact that you're included &quot;hybrid&quot; figures and multiple sizes of caps (except maybe 3 sizes is enough - few people even notice this stuff anyway). <BR> <BR>* <A HREF="http://www.m-real.com/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.m-real.com/">http://www.m-real.com/</a></A> <BR>  It's square (which is nice), and printed on too-fancy paper (not nice), and the previous issue was called &quot;Black and White&quot; - right up my alley. The current issue is all color photos - deathly boring. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
