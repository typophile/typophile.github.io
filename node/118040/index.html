		<div class="commentbody">Well, I reason a bit differently. I have autism and social contact is troubling for me. I haven't been on Facebook or chat software in years and I haven't been on deviantArt for a year or so and I only dare to check my mail sporadically. Getting back on Typophile is my first step to being social again. Having a PM system here would mean that I could at least send out personal messages to type designers, because mail is quite a big step for me. I hope this Summer I'm able to get back on deviantArt and from there get back on Facebook and mail again. It's a big challenge though. The fact that everything on the Internet is so connected causes anxiety for me. I like closed systems, where I know what to expect and not much can go wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's a matter of responsibility. I have a reduced capacity (for responsibility) and I need to keep my world small to maintain it. Years ago I did a lot of freelance work and eventually I took on too much responsibility and things went wrong; in 2011 my whole world just collapsed. Since then I haven't been able to handle the responsibility to work for clients. I do a few projects here and there behind the curtains but I'm certainly not publicly available. Mails are hard for me because of the expectations people naturally have of communication. On this forum, I don't feel like a response is expected of me. I enjoy a certain freedom here. deviantArt is a sort of in-between world of a forum like this and Facebook, where people have higher expectations regarding communication. As such I see it as a natural step that I will first make my way back to deviantArt before I dare to take the next step. I need to expand my world slowly and carefully. If it expands too fast, I will likely suffer mentally and my world will collapse again.</div>
