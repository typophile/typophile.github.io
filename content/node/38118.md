body: "Much like my last ID request, this is more of me looking for suggestions than
  an actual specific ID. I'm trying to find a script that's as close as possible to
  the attached hand-lettered sample. Script MT is almost close enough. It has the
  right vibe, but I'd like to find something a little more open, and with lowercase
  r's that are more like the sample (with the curl of the r higher than the right-hand
  peak).\r\n\r\nObviously, it would be better if I just finished up this hand lettering,
  but they don't have the budget or time so if I can't find something better Script
  MT will have to do. Also, if it helps, the look we're going for is a 60's/70's longboard
  surf logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!"
