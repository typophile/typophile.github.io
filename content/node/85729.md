body: "A few programmers prefer variable width fonts for code, and they are harshly
  criticized by others for it. Reading the forums, I find that all discussion is about
  the use of existing fonts, not about how one might make a proportional font that
  is good for coding. So, I made a series of fonts to explore ideas along this line.
  You can see and download them at http://code.google.com/p/i3project/wiki/Fonts.
  They are released to the public domain (via the Unlicense) and I encourage others
  to use them as a starting point for their own experiments.\r\n\r\nI think I can
  give some general guidelines on making a variable width programmer's font:\r\n\r\n
  - Il1 and Oo0 must be clearly distinguished\r\n - The advance width of \"space\"
  should be no less than \"n\".\r\n - @#$%& need to be roughly the same size and color.\r\n
  - ~*-+=<> need to be vertically aligned and roughly equal width.\r\n - Punctuation
  must be bolder, more differentiated, and have more spacing.\r\n - Letters should
  have no fancy flourishes and caps stay above the baseline.\r\n\r\nThe greatest complaint
  about variable width fonts and working with people who use them is that formatting
  gets messed up. This is because users of monospace fonts do vertical alignment with
  spaces. Most users of proportional fonts use tabs for alignment. I found that with
  wider spaces in a variable width font, you can avoid tabs and code layout will look
  almost the same with either monospaced or proportional fonts. However, this holds
  only if vertical alignment is restricted to the left indendation. \r\n\r\nThe project
  has been a mixed success. I'm very happy with Trim, but not at all with Cruft. I
  put the most effort into Cruft, trying to make a serif font look good with code,
  but to me it's a failure. Maybe it needs a fresh perspective. Anyway, because of
  this, I propose a final rule:\r\n\r\n - Lines should have little or no variation
  in thickness.\r\n\r\n"
