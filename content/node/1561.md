  body: Looks like good ol&#39; &#40;some might say overused&#41; <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-officina-sans/bold/testdrive.html?s=PRIVATE%2BLESSONS&amp;p=16">ITC
    Officina Sans Bold</a>, to me... but the absence of any other id&#39;s from the
    normally prompt Typophile folk make me suspect that there is a trick here&#40;?&#41;

  body: HMM. Yeah it does look like that, but the M is wrong. I thought it was Stainless,
    but Stainless does not have a slab-seriffed letter I.

  body: It&#39;s a very good guess, Dana, but that&#39;s not it. Officina Sans isn&#39;t
    quite as square, and one dead giveaway is that the middle of the M here goes down
    to the baseline, whereas Officina Sans&#39; doesn&#39;t. I haven&#39;t found the
    solution myself, and I was looking through the FF site until I got called away
    to do something else.

  body: Can be Officina, the small i is all wrong. And the serifs of the Caps-I also
    look a bit too long. The C is different. It is quite similar in the overall simple
    and sturdy bureau-look, however, so maybe it&#39;s FF Unit? I haven&#39;t bought
    that yet, so I can&#39;t say for sure. But Unit has alternate versions, so the
    mix of very serif-y large I and the straight-no-horizontal-stem-small-i could
    be made with that. The look&#43;feel of Unit is pretty close, although I&#39;m
    not sure on the y and so on.  <BR> <BR>Very hard to tell with these small text-sizes.  <BR>

  body: I stand corrected... at first the leg of upper case R didn&#39;t seem to match
    either, but when &#34;tested&#34; at smaller size &#40;12 or 16 pt&#41; the difference
    appeared to small to notice. But, at all sizes, the centre junction of the upper
    case M is, as Chesh and Tiffany well said, not a match.

  body: Based mainly on the shape of the C, and the fact that trying to use the Sans
    ID Guide helped pick this family, I am guessing this is Psy-Ops <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_reykjavikss.html"
    target="_blank">Reykjavik One</a>. The only other font I know with a similar C
    is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hamilton/" target="_blank">Hamilton</a>
    from Font Bureau, but the R wasn&#39;t right. Finding lower case examples that
    were clear enough was nearly impossible on that site, so the lower case is the
    most questionable part of trying to ID this font.

  body: 'Hmmm... hey, Rykjavik is a neat font. But I wonder... isn&#39;t the big I
    all wrong, the psycops-typeface doesn&#39;t have any stems/serifs. Man, there
    are so many almost similar fonta out there from so many smaller foundries... it&#39;s
    getting pretty hard to differentiate the stuff. I always admire you folks here
    for being so adept at identifying the stuff :-D. '

  body: I know you can&#39;t prove it from their web site or the .pdf sample they
    provide, but in the &#34;IndieFonts&#34; book it clearly shows that there are
    serifs on the u.c. I and J. I still think <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?6Z3"
    target="_blank">Reykjavik One</a> is the answer. This link shows the Identifont
    showing and shows all letters.
