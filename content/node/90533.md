body: "Hello all, I am currently designing  a site and am at a loss as to find the
  'right' typeface for my body text.\r\nThe logo and the type used in the menu is
  Matchbook and the whole site has a late Art Deco-ish feel to it.\r\nCurrently I
  am using Gudea for the body. But it feels absolutely wrong in combination with Matchbook.\r\nAfter
  looking at fonts for 4 days now my eye's are getting crossed. So I was hoping someone
  would have a suggestion as to which type would fit nicely within this design?\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nPS: I am getting an HTTP error trying to upload an attachment
  so I dropped it in my dropbox here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44628980/Capture.PNG"

  body: "I don't know if you think this is stylistically right, but in terms of\r\nonscreen
    rendering performance and readability it's hard to beat:\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\nPlus
    the ample width makes for a nice contrast with your headings.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I agree with the width-contrast, but I am not convinced they will work together.
    As a bodytype it is a bit too much I think?

  body: "For print design, I agree - for one thing it's a big\r\nadvantage to have
    thick/thins. But the screen's\r\nlimitations make that particular point flip-flop.\r\nOr
    do you mean it has too much character? I think\r\nthe \"g\" might be borderline,
    but with some exposure\r\nis probably accepted by the reader fine actually.\r\n\r\nSee
    this: http://buddhistischer-kreis-erfurt.de/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes, I meant it has too much character (I am not native english speaking
    so sometmes I am struggling for words).\r\nEspecially since Matchbook has a lot
    of character as well. I am afraid the whole site will become a typeface circus.
    I will try to copy-paste some text from that link into my design to see how it
    behaves.\r\nThanks for your help btw."

  body: Why not start with a font you like and then ask, what design would complement
    this type?

  body: "Yeah, in terms of proportions Ernestine might be a bit much of a contrast
    in this case...\r\n\r\nIn case you weren't aware: for prototyping/previewing purposes,
    there are a bunch of webfont preview sites out there that let you quickly preview
    what your site would look like with other fonts. \r\nYou can try Ernestine and
    others from FontFont at http://fontfonter.com/\r\nWebtype has the Font Swapper:
    http://www.webtype.com/tools/swapper/\r\n& there are other such tools, but my
    brain is shot at this time, maybe someone else can help out?"

  body: Thanks all for the help/suggestions. It seems this design is going to be postponed
    for a few months...sigh. Oh well, at least that gives me the time to find a good
    type ;-)
