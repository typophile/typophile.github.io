body: "i'm wondering if anyone knows what this might be?  i'm having a hard time finding
  a font i can use in my classroom to match my wall alphabet.  \r\n\r\ni need a monocular
  g like the one shown in the pic...  and, a nice curved tail on the lowercase q,
  as well as the j.  ideally this font (or one really darn close) would also have
  an alternate lowercase y (rounded and pointed). the font must have the less \"stylized\"
  lowercase a -- not sure what to call that. \r\n\r\nthanks in advance for your skills!
  \ \r\n\r\n(really, i just wish i could redo the whole curriculum to a nicer kindergarten
  font, but... alas, i must be consistent.)  "

    much prefer the balanced e on the yellow card, fyi.  '
