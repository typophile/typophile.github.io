  body: "Hopefully I'm not infringeing Just and Erik's copyright by doing this, but
    here's what they wrote about Beowolf in their Charles Nypels Prize publication:\r\n\r\n/
    / / / /\r\n\r\nRandomFonts\r\n\r\nThe first LettError project was to make a PostScript
    font whose lettershapes changed themselves during printing. Traditional typefaces
    were static copies of physical objects. Digital fonts are programs and therefore
    dynamic.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whose idea it was in the first place. In the only
    issue of LettError magazine (1989) we propsed the idea of randomFonts, type programmed
    to change in the printer so that each character would be unique. After simple
    experiments with a square, we applied the idea to a font. This became Beowolf.\r\n\r\nThere
    was much discussion about the name - we felt that RandomFont was the category.
    Erik Spiekermann proposed Times New Random, but it wasn't Times and Beowolf just
    sounded gnarly.\r\n\r\nYears later, in an article in Frieze magazine, Emily King
    drew a nice parallel between the typeface and the nature of the Beowulf story
    (the first known story to be written in English). The story would have existed
    in many forms until one was written down. Beowolf the typeface exists in an infinite
    number of possible shapes, but only the printed one will remembered. [sic]\r\n\r\n/
    / / / /\r\n\r\nBeowolf is an extraordinary piece of PostScript language writing.
    It acts like any other PostScript font in that it has two components: one for
    screen display, and one for printer rastering. In the case of Beowolf, the nodes
    which describe the letters were instructed to move around a little. In the types
    released by FontFont, there were three levels of randomness, which allowed the
    nodes to move within a small, medium, and large radius.\r\n\r\nHave you tried
    downloading the printer fonts to the printer, and only having the screen fonts
    \"live\" on your computer? Is the printer running PostScript natively, or is it
    emulated by the computer? If it is a PostScript printer, which PostScript level
    is it?\r\n\r\nWith more information, Erik or Just might be able to illuminate."

    them in OS 8.6 (maybe earlier) to 9.2.2 but, if I recall correctly, you need to
    turn off ATM.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: 'I thought the issue was simply that ATM didn''t display them correctly, but
    it''s been a while! There was also the problem of printing separations where each
    layer would be a different instance of the typeface, creating a mess. Personally,
    I think the underlying design is really great and I have told E&J they should
    take it more seriously, but they don''t listen. '
