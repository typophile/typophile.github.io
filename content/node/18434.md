  advance if it has come up before)\r\n\r\nWhen exporting a PDF from InDesign (Mac
  OSX), how can I make sure all fonts are embedded? It only gives this uninformative
  notice about permission bits...\r\n\r\nCan I check later in Adobe Reader if fonts
  are embedded, and if so, how?\r\n\r\nThank you for helping."

    put in: 100% \r\nThe informative notice you're talking about is a hint for the
    user to check if the font policy allows embedding, so if that's ok, just click
    \"ok\", that is: go on with exporting. If there is no appropriate permission,
    the pdf exporting will stop anyway. So generally it's recommendable to check permission
    issues <strong>before</strong> using a font in a publication.\r\n\r\n2. In Adobe
    Acrobat uncheck \"use local fonts\" (Cmd + Shift + Y), you'll find this option
    under \"Advanced\". Possibly there is a similar option in Acrobat Reader."

    body: "Thanks, tina.\r\n\r\nHowever, does \"subset\" really make a difference
      for embedded/not embedded? I always have it set to 0% so that all characters
      are included, not only used characters.\r\n\r\nAccording to your answer, \"use
      local fonts\" means local fonts on your computer, right? Or could it mean \"local
      to the opened document\"?\r\n"

    give you full information whether fonts are embedded, subset embedded or if a
    subsitute is being used for display (in which case it'sll tell you which)"

      body: "Hi\r\n\r\nThis is *apparently* clear. I say \"apparently\" because in
        fact this does not always work. I use InDesign CS2 on PC and find that I cannot
        fully embed all fonts. When I create a PDF from the InDesign file, even if
        I select Embed All Fonts and Subset ... 0%, what I actually get is a file
        with embedded *subsets* only. This causes untold problems with my service
        bureau who say that they need to remove all the multiple instances of the
        subsets before the file will print correctly on their Docutech digital printer.
        \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what causes this problem and what is the solution?
        Help needed urgently, please!  \r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Bray"

  body: "I believe InDesign CS2 always embeds fonts (even the <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-base14fonts.htm\">Base
    14</a>) and it always subsets fonts (despite putting the value to 0%).\r\nWhy
    would anyone want/need to embed 100% of every single font used in the document?\r\n\r\nAFAIK,
    there's no \"Use Local Fonts\" option in Adobe Reader (former Acrobat Reader).
    Nonetheless, it's possible to check if a given font is embedded or not, by analysing
    the Fonts panel in Document Properties.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ms_pdfembed_4764.png]\r\nIn
    this case the fonts are all embedded and subset."

    a printer that a lot of our customers use, indicating that they have a new proofing
    system. One of the changes they require is that all fonts be (fully) embedded.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    we created an InDesign CS2 document on the PC, specified 0% in the subsetting
    block, and generaed a PDF.The text was simply \"Hello world\" (using Warnock Pro
    Regular). On opening the PDF, we were able to edit it, to add  the characters
    \"iu\", which I believe would not be possible if the font had been subsetted.
    And in looking at the PDF file, Preferences > fonts showed \"embedded.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    I too am confused about David Brey's post."
