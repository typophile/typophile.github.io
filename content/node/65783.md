body: "I'm currently building my portfolio up to apply at some art and design schools
  so I decided to create an identity for a fictional museum of art based in Mexico.
  I am now debating on the logo and have created several versions:\r\n1. http://droplr.com/43FfS+\r\n2.
  http://droplr.com/4yB6u+\r\n\r\nAnd I have now pretty much started over and come
  up with this (also attached):\r\n3. http://droplr.com/8nkb4+\r\n4. http://droplr.com/8nZ4Q+\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centro-de-Arte-4_4939.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  \"brief\" for this project is to create an identity that would be a re-birth of
  a dying organization. It fails to attract the younger, sophisticated visitors it
  needs to remain open and fund services for the public. It needs to change its damaged
  image (no existing or marketed identity) and represent itself as something clean,
  modern and luxurious without losing its historical significance.\r\n\r\nI would
  greatly appreciate any honest critique. Thank you!"

    sizes. I took a look back and tried Archer:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centro-de-Arte-5b_5534.png]\r\nWhat's
    your feedback on the type choices for conveying a modern approach to historical
    art?"

    one is the one that better conveys \"modern approach\"."

  body: I agree with riccard. That mark would also be fun for a business that involves
    ears because it kind of looks like one, imo.

    It only really works for the first version. I think the newer posts could benefit
