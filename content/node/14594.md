body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am trying to line up a couple of speakers for a public
  program mid-October at City College where I teach. If you can help with any of these
  wishes, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n1. I am looking for an epigrapher:
  someone who works in stone or other permanent, 3D material.\r\n\r\n2. I am also
  looking for non-Roman script calligraphers (Arabic, Asian, etc.). (We have Chinese
  and Japanese calligraphers on campus, but do you know anyone who does Thai or Burmese
  or Korean or...?)\r\n\r\n3. I would like the contact info for Asa Peavey in the
  SFPL so I can ask him as well.\r\n\r\nAny speakers would have to be local, as the
  pay is only a token and not enough to pay for travel.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAmy"

    of when I drove up there to give my talk. The sushi was pretty good too. :->\r\n\r\nTo
    help things along I just made a post on Twitter for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
