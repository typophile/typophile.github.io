  of my first ever font Agr\xE0ve aren't showing properly in Chrome and Safari. In
  FireFox and Internet Explorer the \u2026  : and ; do show how they supposed to look.
  For example the triple dots are reduced to just 1 dot. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chrome_vs_firefox_5679.png]\r\n\r\nI
  use @font-face in the CSS code and the original OTF (from Glyph App on the Mac).
  So I assume there is nothing wrong with font file, and nothing went wrong in convertng
  becauce nothing was converted :-)\r\n\r\nWhat can be causing this strange problem?
  Anyone?\r\n\r\nDaan\r\n\r\n"
