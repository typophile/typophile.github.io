    worth that kinda money. \r\n\r\nNow I just need to find a client that agrees with
    me :-)"

  body: It's actually not that expensive if you look at a per font price. The whole
    so called 'Superduperset' (contains something like 34 fonts) is $650, which is
    not even $20 per font. Even the single weights are between 35 and 50 bucks, which
    is quite acceptable imo. :)

  body: "Oh... for real. I missed the single font price. I thought it was only sold
    in multiple.\r\n\r\n$35-50 per is definitely reasonable. Usually I just want one
    or two weights to begin with.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah, well, there are packages containing a roman+italic, which are $75. And
    the one-weights are $50. Not exactly <em>cheap</em>, but not that bad. :)
