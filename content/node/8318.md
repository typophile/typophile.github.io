  body: Although it looks like Font Bureau&#39;s Interstate, I think this is the face
    that actually used for interstate highway signs, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pixymbols/highway-gothic-2002/pixymbols-hge2002/testdrive.html?s=REAL+SIMPLE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Highway Gothic</a>. I think they also added some weight to it
    by applying a stroke or something.

  body: I knew te S and M were off. <BR> <BR>Mark, Highway Gothic is based off of
    Goudy&#39;s design isn&#39;t it? Is that common for road signs or is there some
    further history or study I&#39;m unaware of? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

    <BR> <BR>I hadn&#39;t heard that before, but I confess I don&#39;t know the history
    of Highway Gothic. I bet James Montalbano would know. He has spent the last ten
    years designing a replacement. <a href="http://www.clearviewhwy.com/" target="_blank">More

  body: According to <a href="http://members.aol.com/rcmoeur/alphabet.html">this website</a>,
    Highway Gothic is only the name of that particular digital version, not the official
    name of the standard US highway typeface. Presumably, Highway Gothic matches the
    official specification more closely than Interstate.

  body: Thank you for the links.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s only a guess, but I&#39;ll try
    to contact Mr. Montalbano to ask. If he says anything of interest I&#39;ll let
    everyone know.

  body: <i>&#62; Presumably, Highway Gothic matches the official specification more

    typeface, not an exact copy. It feels very similar, but Tobias Frere-Jones took
    many liberties with the design in order to make it a useful and attractive typeface.

  body: Right, that&#39;s what I was getting at. I believe that the Interstate family
    also includes many extended characters not covered by the FHWA specification.
