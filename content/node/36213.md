  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI saw Europa Gro Nr2 SH-Bold Condensed was similar, but was hoping
    that it was an actual stencil type rather than a customised Europa... is there
    any chance of this?\r\n\r\nP.S. I don't think the designer had Europa, but can't
    be sure :-)"

  body: "AG Book Stencil, Cargo and Paralucent Stencil are OK, but I think I might
    trace Europa and 'stencilise' it.\r\n\r\nBut before I do, are there any fonts
    you know of with the distinctive stenciling on the W - both gaps pointing towards
    the middle?"

  body: "Well, I happen to like Glaser Stencil, though I don't think that's exactly
    what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nLinotype Authentic Stencil has a W you'll find
    very unique, in a kind of opposite way from what you probably have in mind.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also Andrew Andy Stencil from Ingrimayne\r\nFerro Stencil\r\nAnd now that I think
    about it, about a bazillion others.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, I decided to modify ITC Franklin Gothic Demi - to the casual observer
    it's close enough once stencil marks are added.\r\n\r\nThe only problems with
    this is that it's missing the subtly rounded corners - does Europa have these?\r\n\r\nSome
    of the characters are quite different but fortunately I only need a small subset."

  body: just use mitering options in illustrator to round your edges a bit and you
    should be good to go. will take some tinkering (and you might need to mess with
    stroking), but it shouldn't be too time consuming.
