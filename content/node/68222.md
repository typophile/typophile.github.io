  body: "Monograms are often made from special engraving plates, as far as I know.
    There are relatively few folks who design fonts for them, but [[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/frontpage.html|Harold
    Lohner]] has one of the largest collections. The Vine and Lace sets are most like
    your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
