		<div class="commentbody"><i>Come on, by the middle of Saturday you could have had a strong idea how many extra books you&#39;d be left with...</i> <BR> <BR>Hrant, if you really think anyone was worrying about what to do with the stack of books <i>or even looking at them</i> on Saturday during the conference, you&#39;ve obviously never worked in those kind of conditions. The conference team has to spend a huge amount of energy simply to stay on top of all the aspects of the conference that have been planned for, to keep everything running smoothly. They do not have time to come up with creative solutions to every unforseen circumstance, although they must handle many unexpected things; their priority must always be to concentrate on the steady operation of the conference as planned. <BR> <BR>By the way, by Sunday morning a lot of people who had received tokens for the book had not picked up their copy yet, because they were waiting until the last minute so they would not have to carry it around. I doubt very much if anyone on the team was keeping a tally of the books: it wasn&#39;t a priority. As to giving the books away: it would have cost ATypI a lot of money to ship them back to England, and then what should have been done with them? They would still be sitting in Sharon Moncur&#39;s office, waiting for the additional expense of moving them somewhere from where they <i>might</i> be sold and some money might filter back to the association. <BR> <BR>Finally &#40;and I mean finally, because this is a bloody silly conversation&#41;, let me recount another circumstance of the conference. I produced 150 copies of a software CD to be distributed to attendees of the Font Technology Forum. I guessed we would have a max of 100 attendees, but I didn&#39;t want to run the risk of not having enough. I paid to have the CDs produced and to have them shipped to Rome. In the end, I had about 60 left over, which were handed back to me by the conference team on the Sunday afternoon. What did I do? I wandered around and handed them out to anyone who happened to be in the lobby. Now, I&#39;m sure there are some people who would have liked a copy who didn&#39;t get one, and there are some people I would have liked to give one to whom I didn&#39;t see in the lobby at that time. If I&#39;d thought about the CDs at any time after the Thursday afternoon, I would have realised that there were extra copies that could be handed out to &#39;deserving&#39; people. Frankly, the CDs were the last thing on my mind. <BR> <BR>If I had been one of the people who carried away an armful of books to save them from an ignominious fate, I would glady send a copy to anyone who did not receive one in Rome who was willing to pay postage. As it is, I only have one extra copy, but I&#39;ll send it to Matha if he shuts up about it.</div>

Someone offers me a case of books &#40;what&#39;s that, 20 books at 1.5kg each? An extra 30kg to carry home&#41;. There&#39;s no way on Earth I&#39;m going to take them - an extra 1, 2, perhaps even 5 if I can fit them in my luggage - but a case full? Dream on. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad that Johns at least posted an explanation of the &#34;book incident&#34; - it&#39;s clear to me, as someone who has worked in those sorts of environments, that no one is really paying attention to a pile of books. And lots of stuff, as John also indicates, is going to get thrown away &#40;I&#39;ve seen delegates basically trash their goodie bags, almost immediately upon receipt&#41;. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s an anonyrat/mouse anyway? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you not think John&#39;s explanation was reasonable? <BR> <BR>No one&#39;s thinking about books, suddenly they have a pile of books to do something with, rather than bin them they give them away. My Experience of Sunday afternoons at an ATypI conference are that half the people have already disappeared anyway. <BR> <BR>If you think it&#39;s really a problem, and people were acting out of malice in any way, then you really should complain to the ATypI board. From my perspective it just seems like people making the best of a bad situation. <BR> <BR>If they were &#34;rationed&#34; to &#34;friends&#34;, then that&#39;s probably a problem. If the method of knowing about the issue was word of mouth, and people just went and asked, then I don&#39;t think it is. <BR> <BR>Would I have taken six books...? They must be pretty heavy books to only be six in a box, I&#39;ll stand by what I already wrote - no.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>They weren&#39;t being offered, you had to go ask.</i> <BR> <BR>The books were being put out on the counter top, and anyone who walked by was invited to take some. The organisers were trying to get rid of them as quickly as possible, so they certainly were not holding them back waiting for people to come and ask. In addition to avoiding the cost of shipping, the organisers also needed to close down the conference and get all their stuff out of the venue that Sunday afternoon. You want to try organising shipment of all those books at short notice on a Sunday afternoon in Rome? <BR> <BR>As I said, this is a silly conversation, about an unfortunate situation that arose because <i>not enough people came to the conference</i>. The organisers made a judgement call on getting rid of the surplus books as quickly as possible, and in the circumstances I find it hard to fault them for that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kudos to ATypI for adding this special membership level, and making it happen so quickly. We should all strive to make this a truly global community; I think we&#39;re making great strides. <BR> <BR>Based on Hrant&#39;s post, which has a delightful air of challenge, I will point out that <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/">SOTA</a> has a history of offering inexpensive membership fees and conference admission. <BR> <BR>SOTA already offers a reduced membership fee of $35USD per year for all members residing outside North America. This membership level is deemed Global Professional, and carries the exact same benefits as the regular Professional membership level &#40;which is $60USD&#41;. <BR> <BR>The annual SOTA conference, TypeCon, is already priced so low that I don&#39;t know how it could go any lower, unless SOTA were awarded some outrageous endowment &#40;not that we&#39;re not trying!&#41;. Registration is under $150USD for professionals, and less than $100USD for students. When we announce the exact admission fees for <a href="http://www.typecon2003.com/">TypeCon2003</a> in a few weeks, I think people will be pleasantly surprised. SOTA members receive a 20% discount off conference admission. Speakers and volunteers get in free. <BR> <BR>For the price of conference admission, TypeCon2003 includes 3 days of programming &#40;accompanied by refreshments; ask Ray Larabie about the cookies&#41;, free admission to some very cool evening events, and more of the good things you expect from an event produced by our community.  <BR> <BR>If anyone wants to discuss SOTA and TypeCon further, let&#39;s move over to the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/sota">SOTA SIG</a> here at Typophile. This is ATypI&#39;s thread, and they should have it all to themselves.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR></div>
