body: "What font would you use to express the words \"Tribal Goddess\"? I want something
  expressing feminine strength, power and beauty. Not too smooth, refined or delicate,
  but not heavy-metal hard-edged either. I thought of maybe a bold Art Nouveau with
  organic shapes, but can't find what I want. \r\n\r\nIf you need inspiration, here
  are two of the dancer/models:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maureen607-7inch_5348.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sharon-album-pic-5inch_3851.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  laying out my own book on costume design, one of a series. The first 20 pages showcases
  sub-genres of Tribal bellydance costume. Each genre has a header in a that suits
  it, for instance: \"Goth\" \"Steampunk\" \"Industrial\"."

  body: I LOVE it, I really do - I noticed this beauty on MyFonts the other day. Unfortunately
    it's a bit over my minimal self-publishing font budget, even on special like it
    is now(totally worth the price, tho). I'll keep it in mind.

  body: I was shooting for an even 49, but it seemed like MyFonts would only allow
    even percentages, so I kept it close. Probably just a matter of my lack of experience
    navigating MyFonts. ;)

  body: "Wow, Raniscript is super for the job! \r\nDid you try using it for the names
    too, in the images (and possibly make these bigger \u2013 the names, not the images
    \u2013 to look a bit more like \"titles\")? Also, I think I'd make the \"Photo:\"
    credits much smaller. But maybe I'm misinterpreting the visual hierarchy you're
    shooting for."

  body: "Nice idea....for the names to be equally ornate. Then I would have to do
    the same for all the other pages, which have different style headers. Gotta think
    about that.\r\n\r\nRight now the photog credits are only 1 point size smaller
    than the names - I suppose they could be smaller. On the dark or busy backgrounds
    they are less noticeable, and I was afraid they might be barely legible. I did
    try putting them underneath instead, but they take up too much real estate.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help! Typophiles have such a good eye for design, invaraably. "

  body: "Nice! \r\nPhoto credits: If you make them a bit bolder and maybe track them
    out a little, \r\nI think you can go quite a bit smaller, depending on the background
    of course (and the printing). That said, do you need to put them directly with
    the images? \r\nI usually try to list them by page number in the back (less cluttered
    that way)."

    does indeed have extensive permanent tattoos. The peacocks on her abdomen are
    photo-realistic. I'm not into the tattoo scene; when I see hers, I'm  fascinated
    yet slightly horrified that young impressionable girls try to copy this. So the
    other two dancers pictured on the spread have none. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see
