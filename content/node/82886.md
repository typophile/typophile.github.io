body: "Greater Albion Typefounders have just released two new typefaces on Myfonts.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/eccles/
  | Eccles]] is another of our 'Early Victorian' typefaces, a series we started with
  the Wolverhampton family a little while ago.  It might be described as 'extreme-Tuscan'
  in style but has a delicacy that many other Tuscan faces seem to lack.  It's ideal
  for giving design projects a clear period feel, particularly in design and advertising
  work.  We also see it haveing considerable application in preparing invitations
  to a certain type of happy event.  At the other extreme, some of our younger associates
  have described it as 'your latest Steampunk font'.  So perhaps we'll just have to
  settle on it having a split personality...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-1_4440.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/oakland/
  | Oakland]] is a Streamline era design inspired by some hand-drawn lettering on
  a 1930's French poster advertising a certain brand of Car (Automobile for our American
  cousins). It's ideal for giving poster and design work that late 1930s to mid 1950s
  feel.  Make a bold statement with this all capitals typeface! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-2_6704.png]"
