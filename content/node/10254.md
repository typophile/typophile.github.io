  body: The problem with brush fonts is that some of the fundamentals of the Roman
    font come from the broad pen held at a 30 degree angle. Thus it is easy for something
    done by Chinese brush to look &#39;wrong&#39;. For example, in your X and Y, the
    top-left to bottom-right diagonal should be heavy and the top-right to bottom-left
    should be thin. You have it reversed.  <BR> <BR>That being said, some brush display
    lettering looks great. You can see a master of brush Roman and italic lettering
    in <a href="http://www.art.net/Studios/Visual/Jillbell/Intro.html" target="_blank">Jill
    Bell&#39;s</a> work. <BR> <BR>The recent movie title for &#39;Sin City&#39; is
    also great.  <BR> <BR>It does seem to work better for lettering than type. Also
    I don&#39;t know how much of this work is  done with a broad brush, which is more
    like the pen.  <BR> <BR>I think you have quite a bit of work to go to figure out
    how to apply the brush well to Roman fonts, but it should be a fun journey!

  body: I don&#39;t know if I agree with William completely.  <BR> <BR>Obviously there
    is a long western writtten tradition &amp; the traditions are there for very good
    reasons. On the other hand there has been a really limited amount of work done
    in chinese brush on western letterforms. The Chinese brush is really versatile
    and has produced many many styles of writing both formal &amp; running hand/grass
    writing. I can&#39;t think that making beautiful western letterforms is something
    it &#42;cannot&#42; do. And when it does, the forms may not conform to the established
    30 degree angle sense of beauty. Then again, maybe they will. My view is that
    it is too early to have a good idea about it.  <BR> <BR>Expecting a good result
    after a small amount of time would be silly. Most of the work I have seen so far
    has been poor to maybe okay. Nothing great. Just experiments.  <BR> <BR>I think
    it&#39;s a worth while project to look for ways to make western letters using
    a chinese technique and hybrid techniques. <BR> <BR>How are you holding your brush?
    <BR> <BR>I would advise you to try it over &amp; over but in a delibertate way
    until you find what you are looking for. <BR> <BR>As for the letters you already
    have I think that the best ones interpret the idea of western forms with tradtional
    eastern construction/brush technique.  <BR> <BR>The capital B begins with a vertical
    Bone &amp; then runs. It has structure &amp; then a flourish. I think it&#39;s
    pretty good. The D,P &amp; R too.The E &amp; F are weak. KLMN too. The B would
    make a good piece of chinese writing - the E &amp; F would not. Do you see why?
    Why not make a curving E like the curves in the B but reversed? Do you know what
    unical forms are? Look at those too &amp; not just roman shapes. The H &amp; J
    are a good start too. They need more work &amp; it might be good to kook for other
    ways of doing them but they are a good solid start. <BR> <BR>You may also want
    to look at Jill&#39;s work just for ideas for the construction of letterforms
    in brush or to consider a new direction as William suggested. <BR> <BR>Have you
    seen this work? <BR><a href="http://www.xubing.com/" target="_blank">http://www.xubing.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>I have also seen the work of a Jpanese artist whose writing was in western
    characters &amp; numbers but who used a vertical running style. I am sad I cannot
    remember his name because the work was very inventive &amp; would probably be
    useful! <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: '&#62;to consider a new direction <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that
    you just have to scrap what you have done. It is a good starting point, but there
    is so much variety in treatment of the current characters - and some are weaker
    than others - that there is yet a lot of work to do. For example, there is the
    issue of consistency of weight. The top to bottom arm on the K, for example, is
    much too heavy compared to the rest, as well as &#39;wrong&#39; from the pen point
    of view.   <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that you have to follow &#39;pen&#39; rules
    to make a good face. But you do have to create your own &#39;rules&#39; that have
    internal consistency and visually work for viewers accustomed to reading Roman
    letters. I agree with Eben that this is a challenging and worthwhle undertaking.
    Good luck!'

    suggestions you made before &amp; have just made are completely solid.

  body: Oh, thank you for your suggestions! I do think there is something wrong with
    my font after I had constructed them all, but I couldn&#39;t tell what&#39;s wrong.
    I&#39;m very thankful to William, because now I know what is my problem. I used
    brush to write down all the letter first to see which one looked better, and drew
    the outlines in computer. I think that&#39;s why I lose some rules in my font.
    I&#39;m also appreciated Eben&#39;s suggestion! Your details about the differences
    among my font are really helpful. And you&#39;re right, to do such experiment
    is really not easy! <BR>But I do learn something. Anyway, thank you both! <BR>
