body: "I saw this signage at an auto shop in the LA area. At first glance I thought
  it was Akzidenz, but there are some noticeable differences that give it a Futura
  look as well. And if that weren't tricky enough, the numerals have the flavor of
  Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nThe closest thing I could think of off the top of my head was
  Nobel, but that\u2019s not quite it. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sans_5845.jpeg]"

  body: "Maybe the designer went crazy and set things in different typefaces. I'd
    estimate three different were used here. Anything in particular you want us to
    ID?\r\n\r\nThe phone number is very close to 'Avant Garde medium' but the \"8\"
    indicates another face."

  body: Yeah, I had considered that. Indeed, the R's seem different between "MERCEDES"
    and "Repairs". I suppose the face I'm most curious about it the one used for "Authorized
    Service" (presumably the same face used for all the brand names as well).

  body: It does look like multiple faces. I would throw [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/avenir/fonts/|Avenir]]
    into the mix as well.

  body: "Unfortunately, none of the faces I've checked the various styles against
    are perfect matches. It's like, \"Futura, but not quite; Akzidenz, but not quite;
    Avant Garde, but not quite; etc\".\r\n\r\nI've even gone far enough to check against
    fonts, like Proxima, that have a very low likelihood of having been used for signage
    old enough to look this weathered."
