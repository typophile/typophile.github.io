body: "I'm revising an article for a journal whose main (well, only) typeface is New
  Caledonia (or a look alike; they managed to stop printing ligatures in 1999, so
  they may have changed printers and fonts or they dropped that drawer), and I'm looking
  for a companion sans serif for figures and maps. I know, I know, I should be using
  the body typeface for the figures as well. I go back on forth on that point with
  a rather regular frequency, and I'd like to at least see it in a sans that matches
  better than Gill, Futura, Cronos, or any of the others I've tried.\r\n\r\nAs an
  aside, I'm rather disappointed that, of fonts I have (which includes the Adobe Type
  Classics collection), very few of them have a prime symbol. (Also used for feet
  and minutes lat/long.) Helvetica has one, and some faces' apostrophes work, but
  not always. \r\n"

  body: "New Caledonia is a modified Scotch Roman (styles like Bell, Miller and Georgia),
    which still has basically a Victorian structure, sort of between Neoclassical
    (Transitional styles like Baskerville) and Realist (styles like Clarendon and
    Century).\r\n\r\nSans Serif companions to look at would include:\r\nGrotesques
    (Bureau Grotesque, STF Dyna Grotesk, Monotype Grotesque, URW Grotesk, etc.),\r\nNeogrotesques
    (AG Old Face, Akzindenz Grotesk, Folio, Helveitca, Berthold Imago, Neuzeit S,
    Univers, Venus, etc.)\r\nand Gothics (Bell Centennial, Bell Gothic, Franklin Gothic,
    News Gothic, Trade Gothic, etc.)\r\n\r\nI agree that FF Bau would a good choice.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for some natural display and titling companions for Scotch Romans
    like New Caledonia, check out Falstaff, Gothic 13, Inflex, Madrone and Thorne
    Shaded. Utopia Headline also works handsomely as a titling font for New Caledonia,
    as does Monotype Old Style Outline.\r\n\r\nAs for the prime symbol, most of the
    faces you mentioned should have it. Make sure your typesetting software isn't
    automatically converting it to an apostrophe. For most fonts, you can access the
    prime symbol directly from the glyphs palette in InDesign.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions (although it may take a while to work through
    3/4 of the sans families :-D). FF Bau is definitely worth considering. Metro looks
    an awful lot like Gill, or are my eyes playing tricks? Or am I looking at the
    wrong Metro?\r\n\r\nAs for my methods for looking for the prime symbol, I was
    using the Special Characters/Glyphs dialog in Illustrator and Font Explorer (U+2032,
    PRIME). The glyph renders for less than 10 out of a few hundred fonts, including
    several opentype Adobe pros. I'm think I'm priming a primal fear of that glyph
    and I will now only touch it primly with a 10&prime; pole, except maybe while
    listening to either Primus or 4&prime;33&Prime;.\r\n"

    I feel they both wink at Dwiggins' Metro.
