<p>It’s a bit complicate. If I understand him correctly, the <strong><a href="http://developer.apple.com/safaridemos/showcase/video/">video</a></strong> is manipulated and contains a redirect to <strong><a href="http://movies.apple.com/media/us/html5/showcase/2010/demos/apple-html5-demo-tron_legacy-us-20100601_848x352.mov">this file</a></strong>. Well, I don’t understand the rest, but he says, that the only reason for the redirect is, to exclude Chrome. He says, that Chrome would play <strong><a href="http://ptrace.fefe.de/apple-html5.html">this</a></strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, the links should have another color here. They are hardly to recognize without the strong-tag.</p>

<p>True, but it hasn&rsquo;t been under constant attack, as Windows has been for a long time, primarily because the number of Windows users far exceeded the number of Mac users. The Mac OS hasn&rsquo;t been&ndash;and isn&rsquo;t immune to attack: there simply haven&rsquo;t been enough targets to justify the effort&hellip;</p>

<p>Right. It&rsquo;s that UNIX based operating systems are typically much harder to exploit than older versions of Windows were.</p>
<p>But this is a tired, old, silly debate.</p>
<p>If and when the day comes that a magic hole is found in OSX requiring us all to fork over $40 to Mr. Norton, so be it, but it&rsquo;s hardly a valid point to be dwelling on while writing one&rsquo;s anti-apple manifesto.</p>
<p>To get the discussion back on track, I like where Apple is going in shying away from Flash. I&rsquo;m not going to miss it.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;d like them to also realize that as they push for open web standards, they really shouldn&rsquo;t be doing silly things like requiring Safari. Granted, I&rsquo;m sure they know what they&rsquo;re doing and it&rsquo;s that their main demographic really just doesn&rsquo;t care. They are mainly focusing on the iOS these days and I can sort of concede that WebKit and Safari will be the primary presentation layer technologies being used.</p>
<p>Given that HP/Palm&rsquo;s WebOS is also heading down that path, that might be the one to keep an eye on.</p>

It excels in so many categories that HTML5 can&rsquo;t even begin to touch right now. Hulu put it well:</p>
<p><em>We continue to monitor developments on HTML5, but as of now it doesn&rsquo;t yet meet all of our customers' needs. Our player doesn&rsquo;t just simply stream video, it must also secure the content, handle reporting for our advertisers, render the video using a high performance codec to ensure premium visual quality, communicate back with the server to determine how long to buffer and what bitrate to stream, and dozens of other things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily visible to the end user.</em></p>
<p>And Apple knows that 90% of MacOS users don&rsquo;t know all this, and they so easily brainwash tons of people to think that HTML5 is the savior (again, not specifically you&hellip; just a lot of people I&rsquo;ve talked to on the subject.) Granted, it will be an excellent addition to web standards, but there&rsquo;s no reason to say it&rsquo;s completely better than Flash.</p>
<p>And as for paying $40 for Norton&hellip; nobody I know who owns a PC has anything like that on their computer. Only moms who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing pay for that useless, memory-hogging program :)</p>

<p>And it is presumptuous for Adobe to want to change the web according to their values.</p>
<p>Adobe wants the web to remain heavily Flash based. Steve wants it to move on towards HTML 5 technologies. Both are being arrogant about it. But I&rsquo;m going to side with the team going the standards route vs. the 3rd party plugin route. (And will gladly criticize Apple for making their demos require Safari)</p>

<p>In this debate there seems to be an attempt to label one the good guy, the other the bad guy. Both companies are looking out for their best interests. Unfortunately for Flash, it never was a built in web standard, so they&rsquo;ve always been at the mercy of the plugin model. That&rsquo;s a risk.</p>
<p>Ironically, prior to the Macradobe merger, Adobe was pushing for things like SVG. They were actually on path towards embracing the more open standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time I checked, you didn&rsquo;t need to buy an overpriced Adobe computer to run Adobe apps&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;d buy overpriced Adobe software to develop Adobe flash apps.</p>
<p>People like vilifying Apple while embracing Adobe. There really isn&rsquo;t much of a dichotomy there. Both are aiming to do the same thing: control a chunk of the web.</p>

<p>Actually, you don&rsquo;t: there are a number of inexpensive programs available&ndash;like Swish MiniMax 3 for $69.95, upgrades for $14.95&ndash;that will produce Flash movies. I don&rsquo;t need Flash at all for the template I purchased (although I have it because it came with the CS3 package I bought). I can make all the changes I need by editing two XML files in a simple test editor.</p>
<p>And, FWIW, I&rsquo;m mot a big fan of Adobe because of their misinformation campaign, several years back, to discredit TrueType as a professional font format. However, Adobe has a LOOOONG way to go to achieve the arrogance of Apple&hellip;</p>

<p>As someone who works at Adobe (but is not an official representative) I don&rsquo;t really see it that way. It just so happens that for a long time Flash was a better way to do certain things that were not possible with HTML. HTML5 will likely do a great many of those same things and some of them it will do better. But some of them it will do worse. And it is likely that there are some things that HTML5 + CSS3 will not do that Flash can do without loads of additional work. (hyphenation anyone?) It&rsquo;s Apple&rsquo;s choice what to support with their products, but I am of the opinion that their customers would be better served if they had the option of running Flash content if they choose. My only regret is that Android is not as mature and fully intuitive as iOS or I would fully be on that bandwagon. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>That’s not comparable. If this is anybody’s fault, than it’s Macromedia’s.</p>
<p>By the way, they also stopped LiveMotion, which I had purchased (2nd hand) and which was much more intuitive than Flash. (I purchased it, when I already did know, that they were going to stop the development. But I directly felt home in LiveMotion.) Discontinuing the development of their own software is more in the responsibility of Adobe. I don’t know, if you are right with the price. It’s not only dependent from the costs of the development, but also from the number of sold licenses. And with regard to the protection of the software, Adobe is generous. I assume, that Photoshop is illegally used on 90% of all computers, on which it is installed. Maybe that’s Adobe’s way, to make people addicted and to get their monopoly position. (Microsoft follows the same politics: Let the Chinese use Windows illegally and in ten years they have no alternative anymore.) But at least Adobe does not tell dishonest shit about moral values.</p>
<p>ImageReady also was great. Adobe should not have stopped the development.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I read that last article but just can&rsquo;t agree with the conclusion. The claim that Safari is going to become a proprietary walled garden for Apple is counter to what they are actually doing with Safari&hellip;using an open source rendering engine that is adhering to more and more modern web standards.</p>
<p>Apple has always had control over their user experience in a way that others haven&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ve decided that&rsquo;s a distinguishing selling point and seem to have done OK with it. There are things I like about it and things I don&rsquo;t like about it but the arguments that the iOS should be more like Android is rather silly, as we already have Android that is like Android. And if we&rsquo;re lucky WebOS will survive, Windows7 Mobile won&rsquo;t suck and maybe even one of the linux attempts like Bada will gain some traction too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thrilled that so many of these devices are supporting relatively modern and open web technologies.</p>

<p>Everything, that is, can be. And nothing, that is not, could be. Most things are illusioning trumpery. I have built my computer six years ago. Unfortunately it still works, although it is daily for many hours in use. So I am not very motivated to build a new one, although it is slow. When I was ten years younger, I thought, that I need so many things. But in fact I don’t need most things, especially not material things. I am hating monopolists, that try to control and exploit people. And actually Apple displaces Microsoft from the first place of my bashing list. That’s all.</p>
