<p>Not for me, i think it&rsquo;s a useful, (very) good hinted, fully developed and adequate designed screenface. Big Problems occur when it set to small! 
Generally it looks disgusting, when printed out via &ldquo;print website&rdquo;. Nothing more, nothing less. Aesthetically i prefer it over Helvetica on Win, even Cleartype enabled, say 5 times more!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, Arial may in some sense be seen as a perversion of Helvetica, but I think the primary reason there is so much rage against it is simply that it is a default, and therefore carries with it a sense of unprofessionalism. Whenever I see Arial or Arial Black used in a design, my initial thought is that the person designing it did it in PowerPoint and didn&rsquo;t bother to change the font from Arial.</p>
<p>Would Arial attract so much designer rage if it hadn&rsquo;t been a default? Maybe, maybe not. I&rsquo;ve seen Arial used effectively (usually with all-caps), but I&rsquo;ve seen it used ineffectively and unprofessionally so many times that even a decent use of it sets off something in my head. There are very few times I see Arial where I don&rsquo;t think that Helvetica would have been a better choice (which is not to say that Helvetica would have been the best choice, but still better than Arial).</p>
<p>What we need to ask ourselves is, what if Helvetica had been a default font in MS Office instead? What about Meta? Futura? Now that Verdana is a default in PowerPoint, whenever I see a presentation set in it I immediately think that it looks unprofessional, regardless of how well-designed the rest of the presentation is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get this reaction to Cambria and Calibri yet, but I imagine that we&rsquo;ll start having similar feelings towards them about 10 years from now.</p>
<p>That said, the leg of the R in Arial is absurd and bothers me to no end. Also, the t and the r.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, I was thinking something similar (that is, that the aversion may be caused by the frequent bad usage, not the badness of the type itself). DrDoc has the same point, and I think his question might be the right one to ask there: what if it hadn&rsquo;t been set as a default?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t get a very negative reaction when I see Arial – honestly, I might ignore a good part of those &ldquo;badly applied&rdquo; cases as well. I really do dislike the leg of the R though..</p>
<p>A better example might have been Comic Sans actually. This typeface is another one of those widely hated typefaces (even in the non-design community). But this aversion may be  connected primarily with the bad usage (at least, for me). Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve read that it is very useable for dyslexics, because of the uniqueness of every letter. That might explain some of it&rsquo;s popularity, because it might be easier to distinguish each letter (not saying that the general public is dyslexic btw)</p>
<p>Sii, I didn&rsquo;t have the patience to learn the other kind of fishing. It&rsquo;s too ambigious and unpredictable. Plus, we have learned to dislike disagreements in my country. Very good for our NNP.</p>

But I don&rsquo;t think those choices are inherently bad design. They would be fine choices for a typeface that isn&rsquo;t trying to knock off something else. In fact, if one could judge from a blank slate devoid of Helvetica&rsquo;s decades of cultural context, I would say the extreme squareness of Helvetica&rsquo;s R is the more dubious decision.</p>
<p>However, in reality, Arial&rsquo;s R loses simply because it is part of Arial, which as a whole is inferior. Not merely because it isn&rsquo;t Helvetica, but because you can tell it was thrown together with very little care in regard to proportion.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My<!-- raw HTML omitted --> greatest peeve with Arial is the way the ends of such curves as c are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nearly, but not quite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> horizontal.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First posting - hello.</p>
<p>I have <em>no</em> typographic expertise, just an interest. Arial &amp; Helvetica are of course ubiquitous but somehow as a layman I feel irritated by Arial but not Helvetica. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a learned &ldquo;type snobbery&rdquo;? The R bothers me also, not just the strange leg but the bowl seems too wide/elongated.
Of course here in the UK, Gill Sans is very widespread &amp; has a &ldquo;quirky&rdquo; R, but I still like it. Don&rsquo;t know why. I acknowledge cerulean&rsquo;s point that Helvetica&rsquo;s R is out of keeping with the rest of the face. The BBC News mixes Helvetica &amp; Gill Sans all the time, but I&rsquo;m getting over it :)</p>
<p>Arial&rsquo;s a lacks something compared to Helv, but the ubiquity bothers me most. In the UK health service it is actually recommended for printed communications, which irks me. 
But the British Medical Association delivered a petition with 1M patient&rsquo;s signatures to the UK Parliament this month, and the front cover appeared to be printed in Comic Sans MS, which was about the design low point of the month for me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think kerning is the issue, as I understand Helvetica metrics were a moving target even back in 1991. And beyond the basic char-set no attempt was made to match  Helvetica widths - in fact the version of Arial in Vista (and latest Mac OS) has many characters not in any version of Helvetica. And as mentioned elsewhere the target for metrically compatible fonts is now Arial, not Helvetica - Albany, Liberation Sans to name but two.</p>
<p>But the kerning issue does raise an interesting question as to if its legally possible to make a metrically compatible version of a modern multilingual OpenType font where metrics, class kerning and OpenType features would need to be matched.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I was in college, my favorite (bad) feature of Arial was its metrics: namely it could turn your 12 page paper typed in Garamond 12pt into the 15 page paper that the professor wanted.  (I was a Classics major, and few, if any, profs cared about the font used.)</p>
<p>To weigh in on the discussion about why Arial is so hated, the lore, at least, is that Microsoft didn&rsquo;t want to pay royalties to Linotype like Apple did for Helvetica and so commissioned Arial.  (Can anyone verify this?)  The problem, of course, is that Arial is a poor replacement for Helvetica, hence, designers' white-hot ire.</p>
<p>Considered on its own, Arial is functional type.  Granted, as many have said before, its &lsquo;R&rsquo;, &lsquo;C&rsquo; and &rsquo;t' are completely inadequate and unnerving.  But it will do in a pinch.  It has no place in a professional design, but for everyday tasks, it is not unacceptable.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the reason - after all metrically compatible fonts were/are nothing new. I think the problem people have is that Arial is far more popular/ubiquitous, to the extent that Apple of all people, licensed it from Microsoft.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For me, there are two big problems of Arial: kerning and diacritics. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kerning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> There is no kerning of accented glyphs in Arial. It looks horrible when Arial is used for setting Czech language, for example the name TAŤÁNA looks like TA Ť ÁNA.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diacritics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The shape of several accents is very poor. The position of (comma-like) caron in the &lsquo;tcaron&rsquo; glyph is not acceptable. It creates a big gap between &lsquo;tcaron&rsquo; and next glyph. 
You can compare Arial with Linotype Helvetica CE. (Although not perfect, at least acceptable).</p>

<p>Really, cause I always thought Comic Sans was the one we hated. Boy, we&rsquo;re as bad as a bunch of politicians, flip-flopping back and forth.</p>
<p>I think we admire Arial. Kinda like G.I. Joe admires Cobra Commander. It&rsquo;s his unflinching ability to pick himself (and his troops) back up time and time again, and continue to fight. Always with the eye on the prize.</p>
<p>Course, Arial succeeded where Cobra failed, what with it&rsquo;s near world domination and all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had a boss once who fancied herself a graphic designer, and she made all the menus (it was a bowling alley) and gave each menu item its own Microsoft Clip Art of the product. So for a hot dog it would say HOT DOG (she didn&rsquo;t use lowercase, and she generally spoke in all caps too) and next to the words would be a helpful picture of what a hot dog looked like.</p>
<p>Naturally, to give it more of a classy upscale look (she was always trying to &ldquo;trend up&rdquo; our brand image) she went for the all-business look of Times New Roman, with the bold button selected for emphasis. On the side she had a business making wedding picture montage DVDs set to oldies, complete with fades and wipes to cut from picture to picture.</p>
