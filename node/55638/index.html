<p>I agree about the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; – placement and shape of the tail seems arbitrary. A loop might work, or maybe look at the &ldquo;B&rdquo; for guidance and have the tail grow out of the left side of the bowl? (Not sure this would work.)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; has an underbite to my eyes. May also be a bit wide (and I agree with Craig that it&rsquo;s short, as well as the &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I think the &ldquo;H&rdquo; may need to be wider.</p>
<p>One thing that strikes me as odd about the &ldquo;J&rdquo; (other than the left side of the curve, which somehow doesn&rsquo;t work) is the long left-side head serif. All your other horizontal serifs seem to be shorter (even on the &ldquo;F&rdquo;, which might benefit from a longer one on the right), so I&rsquo;m wondering why you&rsquo;re making an exception here.</p>
<p>I think the shape of the &ldquo;U&rdquo; is somewhat amiable! But you may want to work out the inner vs. outer curves a bit more smoothly where the curve grows out of the stem on the left side.</p>
<p>Is this going to have lowercase?</p>

<p>Re the &ldquo;Q&rdquo;: I was thinking of a loop on the <em>left</em> side of the tail (inside the bowl). It&rsquo;s mostly the left-side onset of the tail that looks &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; to me – it feels like the tail doesn&rsquo;t deeply &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the bowl, it&rsquo;s just kind of hanging somewhere.
Although that loop you made is cute too. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A: The area over the bar seems a bit tight against the one below. I agree with Craig that lowering could help. The serif on the top looks too heavy compared to the lower left serif.
B: I&rsquo;d look for guidance in the E and F to balance both bowls. Though I like the bar as is, I think it would take benefit from their sisters.
C: Some of our curvy letters (C, G, O, Q) could need to overshoot up and down a bit (as D and S do it at the top). Perhaps it&rsquo;s wide also, as Nina says, but I&rsquo;d like to see it taller before judging that.
D: The stress seems much a bit, and makes it look slightly heavy.
E: I like it as is.
F: The serif at the right side of the stem needs to be quite longer to provide support.
G: The same as the C. I&rsquo;d work more on the small spur.
H: It&rsquo;s too narrow in comparison, especially with the N or the O.
I: Well, it&rsquo;s the master glyph&hellip;
&amp;: Very nice shape. I agree with Craig it&rsquo;s out of character.
J: It deserves a hard work. Look at the U –mirrored– for some help.
K: Where did it go? :-)
L: Might it be narrower just a bit?
M: Good as is.
N: I&rsquo;d cut off some serifs here and there. Perhaps it&rsquo;s me, but it seems too busy. I like it as a whole, anyway.
O: See my thoughts on the C. Nice balance.
P: Hmmm&hellip; I lost it.
Q: You face a hard challenge here. Hear the guys.
R: Gone with the P?
S: Very nice and smooth!
T: I&rsquo;d only touch the serifs at the base, coz the letter is wide.
U: Pay attention to Nina&rsquo;s comments. I like it as well.
V..Z: See you, girls&hellip;</p>

The A is now well balanced (though I cannot feel yet comfortable with the top serif, but don&rsquo;t take it in account).
I&rsquo;d make the spur of the G sharper and less heavy.
Your  J –the first one– now looks great; perhaps the left serif is still long a bit.
I like the newborn K, but the weight of the strokes is odd: the upper is too thick, while the lower is too thin (the should follow the same logic of the M or the V); it happens in both versions –the latter is pretty good; the fat J bothers me, but it&rsquo;s just me.
The open P is nice. I&rsquo;d like to see an alternate P with the tail of the bowl ascending, more B alike, but not too much.
Your R suffers the same lightness in the stroke I pointed for the K; the bowl seems big, perhaps because of this; as with the K, I like the latter version the most.
The S is beautiful as is.
I think the U is still unresolved in its inner curves.
With the V and W I have the same concerns exposed about the top serif of the A, but in that case I&rsquo;m strongly in favor of a thin vertex gently overshooting the baseline.
The X definitely needs contrast (see notes on the K and R); once it&rsquo;s done, you&rsquo;ll need to shift the extremes of the thin stroke.
The Y has a poor contrast as well.
I have to say the same about the Z, even though it&rsquo;s quite beautiful.
You&rsquo;d have to clarify us some questions about the eventual lowercase set, guidance to find a name, and so on.
Cheers!</p>

That descending &ldquo;J&rdquo; is a nice try, though I guess it needs more weight/width.
The fat-flat-top &ldquo;A&rdquo; annoys me a bit; it think the top full-serif one is the best solution for much.
I&rsquo;d try making the upper stroke of the &ldquo;K&rdquo; gets thinner top to bottom, at least a half its current width.
Now, looking thoroughly, the &ldquo;O&rdquo; –and consequently the &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;G&rdquo;, &ldquo;Q&rdquo;– seems to be contrasted in excess, I mean: the thinner parts are too thin, especially against the other glyphs.
You&rsquo;ve got a great challenge with the &ldquo;Q&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure about saying anything.
The leg of the first &ldquo;R&rdquo; apparently needs more weight. Anyway, I like the second &ldquo;R&rdquo;, though its bowl is excesively wide.
I&rsquo;m starting to enjoy the &ldquo;U&rdquo;, as well as the V and W.
About the &ldquo;X&rdquo;, break the thin stroke to avoid the optical flaw that –precisely– makes it look broken.</p>

And (so long as it doesn&rsquo;t make too small of a counter) you could try a high crossbar like H has. Something like this (in structure):

		<div class="commentbody">So I&rsquo;m guessing you thought you were adapting &ldquo;lettering&rdquo; you found somewhere, and the significantly different letters were not present in the book title or whatever it was. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged, as you probably still have the right in this instance, and I think certain letters such as Z and J are much better than the original. The original K has you beat, though. The new P&rsquo;s have merit but I think you&rsquo;ll have to work harder to create worthy R&rsquo;s that go with them. You could also try other more fanciful changes; the possibility of a wineglass Y based on the U comes to mind.</div>

<p>On looking closer I&rsquo;m sure the sign that inspired this font-  I&rsquo;m now thinking of naming it &lsquo;Almira&rsquo; thanks to a helpful suggesion on our blog - and Richmond Old Style share &lsquo;DNA&rsquo;, but there a  surprising number of differences too.  Royund serifs vs squaure cut ones, gently tapered uprights rather than straight, extreme contrast in &lsquo;O&rsquo;, &lsquo;C&rsquo; etc.  I think the unamed signwriter might have seen Richmond and &lsquo;improved&rsquo; on it!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">All manking shares a lot of DNA code, so don&rsquo;t you mind it.
Let me comment on your lowercase set:
a: It seems bold a bit, especially at the top. I thik the bowl undershoots too much, or maybe you must compensate the serif.
b: Something in the bowl is weird, perhaps the lower part&hellip;
c: The bottom terminal does not work the same way it does in the e, where I find it balanced.
d: I think the end of the bowl where it reachs serif at the bottom of the stem needs more air. Currently, that tie is too heavy.
e: I like that design.I&rsquo;d like to see it in context.
f: Both alternates seem pleasant to my eyes (though deeply in my soul I miss the left side of the cross bar).
g: Looks good. Need more work in contrast.
h: At a very first sight, I like it as is.
i: The tittle bothers me, as in the &ldquo;j&rdquo;.
j: The tail is bold a hair.
k: As previously with the UC, you reversed the weight of strokes. I like the last one.
l: No comments.
m: As with the &ldquo;n&rdquo;, &ldquo;p&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo;, IMO the join at the top-left corner lack of light. See my comment on the &ldquo;d&rdquo;. All in all, the glyph is nice.
n: Beyond what I said about the m, I like it.
o: No comments.
p: Did you added a bowl to a &ldquo;j&rdquo;? Descending seems too wide&hellip;
q: Pretty good.
r: I&rsquo;m not totally sure about the terminal, but perhaps is me. Definitely, it needs more light at the white space over the top serif. An unwritten rule states  you sould [[http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&amp;id2=&amp;id3=&amp;id4=&amp;id5=&amp;idpic=17#pictloader|rotate that space at the top 90°]].
