  suggestion) but i realized that i can't attach a file while commenting...whatever.\r\n\r\nthe
  design is somehow going to another direction (it's probably because my attempts
  to maje a nice hand made constructivist face turned out to be pathetic at the best,
  it really is hard to make it right)\r\n\r\nso these are the new sketches, suggestions
  and comments are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nea"

    awkward tension by design. You've approached the edge at some points but design
    wise you're still straddling the line and it gives your attempts a lack of confidence
    I'm not sure you want.\r\n\r\nOut of your three type choices for the title the
    third, Avant Garde?, seems to be the best. The modern aspect of the second doesn't
    work well with the big, blocky simple style you're going for. The first face is
    too funky and 'fun' if you will.\r\n\r\nBTW if you upgrade to Flash Player 8 you
    can now Insert Images into your post, thus you would be able to add this into
    your old thread.\r\n\r\n-Dave"

    Does they serve the purpose of your mission? I see 2 contrary arrows. What does
    it symbolize? What about this? \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kahlkopf.com/files/korkunc2.gif"

  body: I personaly like the Bauhaus first version. I like the idea of the reversed
    sevens coming towards the reader. The only thing I don't like is the heavy black
    border. Try making the second reversed seven break the border of the red block.
    Faked implyed movement.

  body: "Actually the signs (or the reversed 7s) are two k's without the vertical
    lines. What i'm trying to do is to come up with an abstract K shape to use as
    an icon -sometimes without the title.\r\n\r\ni agree that the balance is lost
    in my latest attemts. when i try to go on, i stray from my original idea. so i'll
    go back to the beginning, i guess. \r\n\r\nbtw, wadim, i like what you're doing
    with DS Nova, but the face is a bit too ornamental for me.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nea"

      I combinated a record-button with a letter of logo. I see neither reversed seven
      nor double K in any position. You suggest yourself to see them. '

  body: "It seems that your k's are being read as 7, you could try the k shape that
    Eben suggested from the P22 constructivist set (the simple rectangle with a triangle
    removed from the righthand side). When I think of Russian propaganda art I see
    the heros (worker and soldier) gazing, off right, to a new future. If you divided
    the width of your logo into three unequal parts and used that k shape overlapped
    in red, white and black (or whatever colour order you want) and have as the right
    hand area a simple rectangle, you could create a stong legible image that would
    work on its own and with the strapline.\r\nTim"

    about the unrecognizability of the k's. A quick look at your site gave me your
    solution to the same problem: I didn't understand that your blue avatar/icon was
    in fact the letter K (for Kahlkopf most probably) until i saw you used the same
    K for the headlines text on your site. \r\n\r\nso, here comes another direction
