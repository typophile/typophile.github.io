body: These samples come from a book of Ordinances of the Northwest Territories printed
  in about 1881. The book is mostly set in Times Roman, with its corresponding italic.
  However, the titles of the ordinances are printed in a different italic, the one
  shown here. Note the lc &#39;g&#39; with it&#39;s funny ear and tail. <BR> <BR>Sorry
  for the poor quality, but it&#39;s from a microfiche. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64978.gif"

    it was though... I'll keep looking...\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. Please ignore
    my claim that the book was printed in Times in the original post. I learned a
    lot about in 4 years :-)"

  body: "Thanks for that link...\r\n\r\nThe ear of the g protrudes into the counter...
    way cool!\r\nThe capitals look very Figgins inspired\r\nThe italic f looks incised
    \u2014 something I have seen in this kind of scotch face\r\n\r\nThere have been
    so many talented type designers of past that are finally getting recognition.
    \r\nHopefully some more information about the guy (or gal) that did this typeface
    will come to fore. \r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\n "
