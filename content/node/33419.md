  and arts magazine. Wide variety of readers, from young adults to old folks. I want
  the new look to be contemporary, sophisticated, unique. We've been using mainly
  Janson and Univers since the magazine's introduction about a decade ago.\r\n\r\nA
  few fonts that I'm taking a closer look at:\r\n\r\nSerifs: Whitman, Kingfisher\r\nSans:
  Bliss, Apex new, Klavika\r\n\r\nWhatever sans we go with will need to be a fairly
  extensive family.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on either serif or sans serifs? Or combinations?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAlso,
  out of curiousity, does anyone know a ballpark figure for what custom faces cost?
  Probably out of our league, budget-wise, but I didn't see any info on Hoefler's
  site."

    is a thread</a> about similar square sans serifs. Might give you some ideas.

  body: "Blake --\r\n\r\nWhile you're contemplating your decision, you should know
    that I recently completed <strong>Whitman Bold Italic</strong>, along with <strong>Semibold</strong>
    and <strong>Semibold Italic</strong>, for a Font Bureau client. These should end
    up in their Retail library pretty soon. (I know a lot of people have been waiting
    patiently for these.) Corresponding small caps fonts are also in the works.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need more information sooner rather than later, you can contact Harry Parker
    at the Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to know that I'm in the
    final stages of the <strong>Whitman Display</strong> family, an expansion of some
    custom work that was done for the <cite>Tacoma News Tribune</cite> and <cite>Minneapolis
    Star Tribune</cite> newspapers a few years ago.\r\n\r\nHere are a few first-ever
    public previews:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitmDis_ShowingBeta_6550.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitmDisCond_ShowingBeta_5168.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitmDisComp_ShowingBeta_4447.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    can't tell you the timing for eventual release; but if you're interested, Harry
    could help you there as well.\r\n\r\nIncidently, Whitman and Bliss were introduced
    to each other in the <cite>Virginia Quarterly Review</cite> in late 2003, and
    from what I can tell, that marriage is still healthy and happy.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"

    body: "Ooh, bold italic! That was the main concern we had with Whitman. Now it'll
      be a serious contender. Thanks Kent!\r\n\r\nWhy are so many contemporary serif
      fonts omitting a bold italic face? I noticed at least a few other good faces
      without a bold italic. What gives? On occasion when I use reversed type, I'll
      use the bold weight for legibility purposes. With as many books and publications
      we mention in our text, a bold italic is a must.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blakedinsdale.com\">\u2014Blake</a>\r\n<a

  body: "Blake -- I thought the Bold Italic might make a difference. That's why I
    mentioned it.\r\n\r\nI can't speak for others about omitting the bold italic,
    but for me, I never expected Whitman to be so well received. My personal focus
    is on book work, and I almost never use  bold italic. I expected the face to appeal
    only to a few others with similar needs. \r\n\r\nFrankly, I was more interested
    in getting the initial fonts released, and then possibly doing the bold italic
    later, if there was call for it. In restrospect, this was probably a bit short-sighted,
    but I'd already spent about two years on the design and I really wanted to see
    some return before investing in more styles.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief bit of internal
    debate at FB about releasing the family without the bold italic. And Mike Parker
    told me the cautionary tale of Ruzicka's Primer, which was released without a
    bold and never got one, which Mike argues really hurt its success. I promised
    that I would get to it after we'd had a chance to see how well Whitman was received.\r\n\r\nThen,
    as fate would have it, I became immersed in an all-consuming director job for
    a couple years.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm only now coming around to finish up the family.
    Better late than never, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAlso, from conversations I've had with
    other colleagues, Bold Italic is held by many to be something of the ugly step
    sister in most families, and many designers dislike doing them. It seems this
    is often the first style passed off to interns or assistants.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"

    on it!\r\n\r\nBut . . . I can also sympathize with the frustration on that occasion
    when it turns out you need it and it's not there. For example, more than once
    I've spec'ed heads in one of the bold Bureau Grotesques after having carefully
    grilled the editor or scoured the manuscript to make certain that there aren't
    any book titles or emphasis in a heading -- only to have an eleventh-hour edit
    or AA introduce something that absolutely *must* be italicized. Very frustrating.\r\n\r\n<cite>How

    I know that FB does work out test licenses on occasion. It's not my place to make
    any promises; I'm just a freelancer. If you have good control over your design
    and production team and fonts don't stray out of the office, then give the Font
    Bureau a call and talk to Harry Parker. He can give you the low-down on test drives.
    He's typically in the office afternoons and into the evening, Eastern time.\r\n\r\n--
