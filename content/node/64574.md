body: "Hey all, some discussions here touched on this, but I still can't find a good
  answer.\r\nI'm using Windows, and I'm trying to render some true type fonts to fit
  into an 8x8 grid and then reduce the grayscale to 1 or 2 grays for use in old video
  game roms.  I tried several methods and most came out really crappy.  While trying
  to find a better way I found out that the solution is hinting to keep the clarity
  at low point sizes while still softening the edges of the curves.  This works really
  well, except Windows' font smoothing kicks out at those font sizes except in a few
  fonts I've tried it with.  So-far the only solution I found that might work - a
  CSS webpage tag that forces antialiasing at small sizes didn't work for me.  Does
  anyone know a program, dll modification, or font data modification to make windows
  keep it's antialiasing active at the font sizes I wish to use?  Will a mac computer's
  rasterizer do what I want?"

    you describe.\r\n\r\nAlthough I seriously doubt a character on an 8x8 grid wil
    look <em>anything</em> like the original font.\r\n\r\n(A post-edit thought: why
    not draw the characters in black & white, at 200% scale, then downscale to get
    4 levels of grey? Or indeed, as large as you want, and clip grey values when downscaling.)"

  body: "Thanks for the replies!\r\nHelvetica turned out really well in notepad.  I
    was amazed.\r\nhttp://www3.telus.net/anapan8/ldj/lsdjfonts_3.gif\r\nThe 200+%
    method works, but the horizontal and vertical lines tend to come out as shades
    of gray with all the scaling methods I tried unless I moved the letters around
    trial-and-error like.  Too messy.\r\n\r\nI'll try out Freetype and see if there's
    any way to coax it into doing what I want. Sourcecode is available so I may be
    able to do something with that.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link, I'll load up Fontographer
    and hunt down the GASP dialog.\r\n\r\nI knew I was asking in the right place."

  body: I don't think Fontographer gives you access to the GASP table. FontLab, Font
    Forge do. If that's all you want to do, you can use TTX.

    Are you actually making new ROMs for old video game systems, and want to have
    the type rendered as nice as possible? Or are you trying to simulate the type
    from an old game system? I've heard of some old Atari games that used grayscaled
    bitmap fonts, but that was extremely rare - I've never seen it.\r\n\r\n> I seriously

  body: "Oh cool!  I think TTX is just what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nI'll give Photoshop
    a try first, I'm more familiar with Paint Shop Pro, so that's what I've been using.
    \ It's rasterizer is OK, but doesn't seem to use hinting.  Still it worked better
    than the resizing method.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm replacing the fonts in Little Sound
    DJ for Gameboy.  It's important to have a really readable font on a screen that
    small, and I didn't like the default fonts it had available.  I posted my first
    results to [[http://8bitcollective.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=16226|8 Bit Collective]],
    and had requests for some True Type fonts.  I've done this kinda thing on other
    games and programs for older systems - Pocketnes for GBA, and some other rom hacks.
    \ Whenever I tried to convert a TTF I got mixed results, and windows font smoothing
    (or lack of it) has always been where I hit a brick wall.  After Helvetica turned
    out so good I started searching for a way to replicate it with some other good
    fonts and wound up here.  I'm glad you guys have such good suggestions.  I've
    been trying to figure this one out on and off for years."
