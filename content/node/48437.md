  body: Renner himself in his 1922 book "Typografie als Kunst." Before he did the
    first drawing for what would become Futura he said that all of European writing
    is based on Roman versals, that were themselves defined by the most basic and
    distinct of graphic forms; the circle, the square, and the triangle. Covered in
    my thesis. http://typophile.com/node/18165
