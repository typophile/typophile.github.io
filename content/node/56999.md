  is no longer a decent free font manager for OS X, Font Book be damned."

  body: given the cost for FontExplorer relative to Suitcase Fusion and FontAgent,
    can I have advice on which tool is the best buy?

  body: If they are charging $79 now, that dramatically tips the scales. I'm going
    to have to re-evaluate the options.

    It seems nice, but I haven't really tried it in depth yet. It's not free, but
    a bit cheaper than $79.

    if you get a chance, check out the newest version of Suitcase Fusion 2. We've
    got a free 30 day demo up on our site. I think that you'll be pleased.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.extensis.com/suitcasefusion\r\n\r\nJim

  body: Does Fusion still lock up all of your fonts into that database thing? I hated
    that last time I tried the demo. I like having a directory structure that I can
    work with manually if I so choose.

    in the Vault, or add them in-place from your disk. You can choose this option
