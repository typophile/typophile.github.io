  shape of the letters) is a big no-no, that it should remain as it was created. Is
  this accurate and if changing letterforms is legal, what are some general guidelines
  to abide by? I am creating a logo and wondering how far I can push it or if I should
  just draw my own. \r\n\r\nOpinions or references would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Once you purchase a font for composing you do not have any restrictions as
    to altering the font characters. You can push the graphic as far as the client
    will pay! I worked for a graphic designer by the name of Jay Dom and he made his
    living just altering headlines for ad agencies.

    that S shows up the limits better than any other character especially in the diagonal

  body: According to type font traditions in the US you may alter a font and change
    the name and your home free. Just think about Hermann Zapf with more than 23 bogus
    fonts of Palatino. Most foundries will frown on any pirating but URW++ continues
    to pirate my fonts.

  body: "\"Once you purchase a font for composing you do not have any restrictions
    as to altering the font characters.\"\r\n\r\nMost fonts are licensed, not purchased.
    The legality of what you describe is completely dependent on the EULA. In some
    cases, you have signed a legally binding agreement to not do that.\r\n\r\n\"According
    to type font traditions in the US you may alter a font and change the name and
    your home free.\"\r\n\r\nHmmm. You might want to tell that to the US federal district
    court(s) that have found otherwise, for digital outline fonts. Try reading the
    *summary judgment* in Adobe vs SSi for starters.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Are you seeking legal opinions or aesthetic ones? This is probably not the
    best forum for legal opinions.\r\n\r\nBut I would say this: If you can modify
    the type in an application program (e.g., InDesign), there isn't much difference
    if you do the modification in a font-editing program (FontLab) & then save the
    font. The oddity is the license may allow for one (Applications program) and not
    the other, but if you are just using it for your own work, who would know?\r\n\r\nAs
    to the aesthetic concerns, almost all fonts can be improved, and almost all can
    be hurt -- or ruined. I'm reminded of the saying \"democracy is more than two
    wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner\" -- Like dinner, aesthetics
    is not a simple matter of voting."

  body: "There are two different kinds of modification in my mind. One is 'type torture',
    where letter forms in a line of type are all squeezed or stretched. This is very
    common on signs, and beyond a few percent is a prescription for subtle--and sometimes
    not so subtle--ugliness.   \r\n\r\nThe other kind of modification is where you
    convert to outlines, and adjust not only spacing, but also letter forms to make
    a logo look better. In the hands of person who is good at it, the results can
    be excellent. And so far as I know it is normally OK legally, so long as you have
    licensed the font.     "
