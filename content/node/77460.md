  a typeface. Both Neutraface No. 2 (Display Titling) and Verlag Compressed (Black)
  seem to work equally well with it. I was wondering what you all would consider the
  better investment? I have to make these font purchases count, so I want the most
  bang for my buck, as it were.\r\n\r\nYou thoughts?"

    striking with its pointed apexes. But these are very different in width. Why aren't
    you thinking Verlag Black in its regular width?"
