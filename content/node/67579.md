  body: "My guess is that it's either a custom font, or custom lettering, by [[http://www.typesetit.com/enter.html|Rob
    Leuschke]]. If you look at his script fonts, especially Corinthia, you will  see
    so many characteristic similarities to this lettering. \r\n\r\nI will e-mail him
    to ask if he knows about this lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    said that the lettering isn't his work, although he agrees it looks similar to
    some of his lettering. He's curious to know who did it now too.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    might know what it is for future use.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help Mike."
