  body: "Speaking as a professional software developer and a type enthusiast: I like
    it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there just isn't much demand for hand-crafted pixel
    fonts anymore these days. Furthermore, given the wide range of physical DPI resolution
    of the displays in use, it's likely that any given pixel font would be either
    too large or too small for any given user. (In my case, your pixel font is significantly
    too small to be practical for workhorse use.)\r\n\r\nNice job, though."

    I suppose that means it's a decent design. :)\r\n\r\n(b) I took out the serifs
    on those fonts to see the difference, and I don't think I like the change. Maybe
    I'm just used to the serifs being there by now, and you're used to them being
    absent (in Dina, for example). To me, it feels like if the i, j, l, and (almost)
    t have serifs, then the f should have one too. Here's a picture for comparison.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cn
    serif noserif_3834.PNG]\r\n\r\n(c) It was in fact after being frustrated with
    Dina that I decided to make this font. It's been so long since I designed the
    font (I just realized it's been about three years since I made it, not one as
    I stated above) that I can't remember exactly what the issues were. I have a feeling,
    though, that Dina felt too wide (it's 7 pixels wide whereas this is 6): my lines
    were disappearing off the screen and I saw there was wasted space between the
    letters.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose I want to publish this online as a free font. Where's
    the best place to do that?"

    you want to make a TTF of it, you could rebuild it with <a href=\"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/\">Fontstruct</a>
    and share it there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/\">The
    League Of Movable Type</a> is another option.\r\n\r\n(Of course you could just
    put it up on your own website if you have one, but the places I mentioned are
    more likely to generate some interest for your font.)"

  body: As an occasional programmer, I like the 1ilI disparity and especially the
    curly brackets. I would have to compare side by side with other options to judge
    the rest of it. I can't remember what font I use, but ProggyFonts.com has some
    good ones. I don't know if they would accept a submission as it were, but it's
    something to look at.

  body: "Perhaps this is too late, but I have a few comments.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is
    pretty good, I think. It does remind me a lot of Terminus (the font I use in my
    Linux Terminal). Other characters remind me of the terminal font it switches to
    on boot (no idea what that's called). If I can I'd like to get a copy of this
    (in a bitfont format) for use in my terminal.\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions:\r\n\r\n*
    The Curly brackets are not exactly alike, I think the leftward one needs work.\r\n*
    Colon and semicolon should be raised to x-height\r\n* The a, c, s, and other characters
    appear to be trying to use less pixels, however the r and f are complicated with
    serifs in a way no other characters are.\r\n* For a font intended to be used in
    terminals, it has some pretty lofty ascenders and descenders. They look good,
    but that's not the goal in a terminal font.\r\n* Your lines are also a little
    farther apart than they should be. You've minimized space very well horizontally,
    but vertically not so well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the height of ascenders and descenders
    may or may not be a problem. It probably depends on preferences. I would like
    to see a bitfont file though (like .bdf), that would be useful to me."

  body: "This thread is most likely dead, but I'll vouch for the f and r serifs. I
    think it makes the font more readable. With a terminal font, consistency is less
    important, and anyway, the letters you should be looking at as ones that stand
    out are the unserifed d and b. But these are good choices too because they are
    more legible because of it (their extra width is something I really like about
    this font).\r\n\r\nTo me, the vertical spacing seems comfortable, but like you
    said, that's just personal preference.\r\n\r\nAs for the colon and semicolon,
    I think being in the middle of the x-height is not a big deal. You could claim
    that it helped distinguish them, but I'm not sure it would be much of an advantage.
    I would be more concerned about the weight, because the colon seems pretty easy
    to overlook. I will say that I love the disparity between the two though. Because
    of that thick comma, it's very easy to tell them apart.\r\n\r\nAnyway, sorry,
    Brian, for contradicting almost everything you said, but that's how I feel about
    this font."
