  body: "well I was born in Boston, and learned to skate at 6yrs in the cemetery fountain
    behind my house in Dedham MA, and had skated every year and use to dream of ice
    all over the streets so we could skate to school but that never happened. We use
    to flood the back yard and skate on that or skate in cemetery ponds, the outdoor
    swimming pool deep end use to freeze over  with enough rain water to skate, and
    on the ponds when it was mid winter. Then when we got older we'd play at the new
    Rink but our games use to be as early as 5:00am. My school had one year of ice
    hockey then cancelled it!!! but it was resurrected about 1997 and I think it has
    a team now.\r\n\r\nSo if you grew up in somewhere that has cold weather all winter
    and the ponds freeze you would either akate all winter or ski. Depending on how
    high your hills are.\r\n\r\nI loved ice hockey but went further in baseball since
    we lived in an american football town (NFL hall of fame Howie Long played for
    our school) and a baseball town that had the oldest American Legion program in
    the US.\r\n\r\nIt a bit difficult to play in London since the only rinks I know
    are small or going to close, Basingstoke has a nice full size rink but it's a
    bit far on a Sunday night.\r\n "

    hour skating and goofing around passing the puck. \r\n\r\nI began playing in an
    organized hockey league when I was around ten years old. \r\n\r\nWhen we weren't
    playing in a league my friends and I played street hockey in the summertime or

    on a backyard rink, ...or go down to the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead me now - believe

    It is just Hockey, dammit. The other one is \u201CField\u201D Hockey. (And no
    self-respecting male would play it.)</cite>\r\n\r\nAs someone who played field
    hockey on my high school team, I would take great exception to that sentiment.
    :-) Field hockey can be a brutal sport, by the way, as should be expected from
    any sport featuring men wielding sticks and solid plastic balls similar to billiard
    balls; I think I got more injuries playing field hockey than all the other sports
    combined. Then again, those were soccer and volleyball.\r\n\r\nI enjoy watching
    both major forms of hockey (and variations like floor hockey, broomball, and bandy),
    but unlike most Koreans I never was much of a skater. My mother used to skate
    on the frozen streams near her home in the winter when she was growing up in Seoul,
    but nowadays you don't see that so much since the winters are warmer. In fact,
    this past winter was ridiculously wild, and the River Han didn't freeze at all
    for the first time in decades.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think Korea might be one of
    the few countries where you really have to specify which code of hockey you're
    talking about, since both ice hockey and field hockey have a wide following (my
    high school in Korea, Kyungbok High School, is a big ice hockey school). I'm guessing
    that's the case in Japan, too, maybe Germany."
