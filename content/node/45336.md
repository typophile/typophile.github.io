body: This is an Identity logo design that I made for my portfolio, namecard and etc,
  I used only black, red and pastel colors. I would love to hear some comments of
  what you guys think about my identity design.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identity_4522.jpg]

  body: It's quite nice as a composition. It might be a bit much for a logo, but certainly
    works as a cover/visual.

  body: "I, too, saw a cover/visual instead of a logo.  The text is tiny right now;
    how could this ever wind up on a business card, for example?  Simplify, simplify,
    simplify.  Clearly you have the talent. \r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: I sort of make my identity design more flexible with the type arrangement.
    Here is my letterhead and namecard design. I am not sure if the arrangement looks
    good. Would love to hear comments and suggestions.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/i_3881.jpg]

  body: This can work. It isn't a logo, but a branding system, and seems to work well
    based on your sample implementation. Go for it.

  body: Agreed. Looks good and works well as an overall system. It's easily recogniseable
    branding that looks quite versatile and could adapt to different uses. Nice one.

  body: it isn't something I would ever create, but it's good.  It reminds me a lot
    of the simplicity and creativity that Paul Rand put into his work.
