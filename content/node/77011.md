body: "I am having trouble adjusting the spacing between paragraphs in InDesign. It
  allows me to make the spacing bigger, however going into the negative introduces
  an error. Does anyone know how to make the spacing tighter without tightening the
  line spacing? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_6030.jpg]"

  body: Do you have an extra return where each green block is? You only need to push
    return once to go to the next line and use the paragraph spacing to make the space
    larger than the normal leading. If the paragraph spacing is at 0 then the space
    between lines shouldn't be any more than the normal leading.

  body: "Don't put blank lines between paragraphs as spacers, it makes it harder to
    control spacing and also you could end up with a blank line at the top of a column
    or page.\r\n\r\nAs Penn mentioned, use paragraph spacing instead. You can access
    it 3 ways -- the Paragraphs palette, or the control bar (shown below) at the top
    of the window (be sure the P is selected so it shows paragraph attributes), or
    via a style sheet applied to those paragraphs. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spacing_4339.jpg]\r\n"

  body: Penn, There is only one space where the green blocks are. I'm still having
    trouble making that space tighter than the normal leading. What am I doing wrong?

  body: "> there is only one space where the green blocks are.\r\n\r\nDaanen, when
    you say \"one space\" do you mean one empty line?  What Penn and I were saying
    was you should delete those empty lines between the paragraphs, and space out
    the paragraphs using InDesign's \"space below\" feature."

    (and grammatically incorrect)...

  body: "A common mistake when formatting \"by hand\" is to forget to include the
    final hard return. It's possible the hard return has another size or leading than
    the regular text (possible also combined with Align to Baseline grid), which makes
    the next line jump down more than you'd expect.\r\n\r\nTriple-click one of the
    paragraphs -- this will <em>include</em> the final hard return -- and check if
    all text has the same size and leading."

    hidden characters?\r\n2. As Theunis suggest, make sure that 'Align to Baseline
    Grid' isn\u2019t selected."
