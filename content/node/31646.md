  site, still working on getting some type up. I'm into raw hand drawn type, new and
  old swiss, bauhaus, and all the weird custom type from the northwoods / wisconsin
  area.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to posting / crits.\r\n\r\nYou can get an idea for
  the trouble I'll cause here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kylefletcher.com\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    logo! Just last week I had the idea to make letters using the shapes of weapons
    like that, and as usual someone beat me to it!

    it. Have any examples of type projects you've been up to?  I'm still new so I'm
    not quite sure how to hunt people down through these networks yet.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    got to make some fonts for chank while there:\r\n\r\nhttp://chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5483\r\n\r\nAnd
    by 'make fonts' I really mean just trace some beautiful old wood type. I wouldn't
    call it grand design. Just fun.\r\n\r\nThese days I spend more type hacking ASP.net
    code and the like with the odd freelance gig and typophile to keep me sane. ;O)\r\n"
