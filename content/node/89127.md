  \u2013 the poetry is causing a real headache to typeset. There's around 40 poems
  in each issue and the poets are supplying poems with their own 'creative' typography
  \u2013 open leading, bizzare tabbing, alternating weight etc. Is there a way of
  approaching this type of copy sympathetically? It's very frustrating.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The tricky part with poets is that half they do, they do for a reason, while
    the other half just follows from the software. Quite often, what they supply isn't
    really what they want but the closest they can get (think of people using spaces
    to make fake-tabs). The issue here is that you can't see what was done intentional
    or not. Often a change in typeface (which they don't own themselves, but you do)
    can solve for instance the need for different weights.\r\n\r\nBut you can't find
    out without knowing what their intentions were, and well I can't expect you to
    go and contact 40 poets and sit down to finetune each of their project. The problem
    is that as a designer you set the text to readability or rhythm, while the poet
    (hopefully!) makes their choice based on the mood they want to get across. Of
    course that's typography as well, but without delving into the mind of the poet,
    you can't come up with a pretty solution.\r\n\r\nYou can try to filter the software
    induced 'creative' typography from that which was done for a specific reason,
    and leave the first out. Otherwise you can always (if you are the editor) ask
    for certain restraints, or come up with a basic shape every poem has to fit, with
    each a few variables (such as tabs, etc) This of course limits the poet in what
    he can do, and is not favorable for the medium.\r\n\r\nOf course this all varies
    on the thoughts behind the book, do poets send in their work? Are they approached
    to make something?  It can be a pain to set, but the amount of customization of
    course also depends on the design of the book as a whole."

  body: "From your other posts, I'm assuming you're a designer who sets type, rather
    than a typesetter who occasionally designs (which would be me). I think Arthur
    gave a good answer, to the extent that your question was about lessening frustrations.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are at typesetter, you are selling your skill and your time. The same for
    a designer, of course, but it is harder to quantify both time and skill in design.
    Limiting yourself to just the typesetting aspect, charge more money. I find that
    getting paid for my time usually lessens the frustration."

  body: "Thanks \u2013 much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe poets send in their work and
    if it's selected for inclusion then it's my job to set it \u2013 it usually comes
    in in word documents, a frustrating job of translating into our type style follows.\r\n\r\nThis
    is spot on: \"The problem is that as a designer you set the text to readability
    or rhythm, while the poet (hopefully!) makes their choice based on the mood they
    want to get across.\"\r\n\r\n\"Typography exists to honor content\" as Bringhurst
    would say, but what if the content is unpleasant typography?\r\n\r\nHo hum. I'm
    glad I don't have to set poetry often."

  body: Why not just accept .txt files only? That way, if they want something special,
    they have to write it out in plain text. You can give them an [i] and a [b] for
    the basic hierarchy.

  body: "It can be hard to tell if unorthodox formatting is deliberate or just a mistake.
    I often receive articles from clients that have weird formatting quirks that turn
    out to be just goofs. As Arthus said, you can't know their real intentions without
    talking to them, which is probably impractical. \r\n\r\nSo perhaps the best approach
    is to just tell them up front that any poetry that's accepted will be formatted
    in your publication's standard poetry style, and maybe show an example of that
    style. "

    are too restrictively, it might indeed cause some authors to drop out. You'd need
    to use very good judgement to create guidelines that you think most authors would
    find reasonable. \r\n\r\nMy point was just that if you're trying to get away from
    wildly inconsistent formatting (including weird formatting that may just be a
    mistake), then it's better to let the authors know that up front, rather than
    making formatting changes that will come as a complete surprise to them. \r\n\r\n"
