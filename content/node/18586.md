  the ampersand is drastically different\r\n  than that of Univers'. Im getting the
  feeling that\r\n  it is to Univers what Arial is to Helvetica;\r\n  just some company
  trying to get around copyrights.\r\n \r\n  Anyway, any help would be appreciated,

  body: "It is indeed Bitstream's version of Univers. Bitstream did a number of faithful
    digitizations of \"industry standard\" fonts in the early eighties, including
    Univers. In cases when they couldn't license the name, they made up their own.
    At TypeCon last year, it was announced that Bitstream and Linotype (which owns
    the rights to Univers) reached an agreement whereby Bitstream can use the name
    \"Univers\" instead of \"Zurich\" (and other Linotype names), though they are
    still calling it \"Zurich\" on MyFonts.com.\r\n\r\nUnivers has always had two
    different ampersands. The one that looks like \"Et\" is Frutiger's original design.
    Linotype did the other more conventional one apparently out of fear that customers
    would not accept it. Both are authentic, but both are not necessarily available
    in any particular version of the font."

  body: The completely revised, redrawn, and expanding Univesr family that Linotype
    developed with Frutiger in the mid-1990s, Linotype Univers, uses the "Et" ligature
    again instead of the alternative. Hooray!
