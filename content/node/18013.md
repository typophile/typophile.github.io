body: I am making a logo for a performance art festival. This logo was selected but
  we are still unsure about the typface. We would like something with a little more
  personality but without being trendy. I have been looking at techno-ish fonts but
  can't find anything that is not going to be out of fashion in 2 weeks. It can't
  be an old style typeface (unless I am proven wrong), I need a sans serif, a bit
  blocky, but supple enough to use as body text. Would be great if the typface looked
  like a monospace but is actually  proportinal. Don't know if this last request makes
  any sense. Anyway, thanks for your help.

    I think the normal* style is a better choice, there is a monospace version as
    well but I think the number of Ms in Momentum preclude using that.\r\n*non monospace\r\n\r\nTim\r\nP.S.
    should that be platform?"

    they feel a bit corporate. But thanks for the suggestion, it made me consider
    Storm's type which I had complitely overlooked.\r\n\r\nP.S. being a french speaking
    belgian working for a german speaking swiss client we have not noticed that misspelling
    \u2014 but then my french spelling is even worse."

    FSD (Fabrizio Schiavi) has some nice techno, but not trendy typefaces.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/fsd/"

  body: Thanks guys! Some good suggestions there. I think I will suggest to my client
    that we use <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11054.1.6>Typestar</a>
    It has that techno-monospace but proportional look I was looking for and our brochure
    wont look like a club flyer.
