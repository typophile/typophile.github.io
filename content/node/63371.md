  It's an applet written in Processing that creates a dynamic typeface.\r\n\r\nsource:
  laikafont.ch\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/laika_5641.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Type
  has always been something static.\r\nIn considering type we speak, for example,
  in terms of bold, thin, grotesque, classical, roman, italic: terms that all describe
  a defined variant of the font family. Thus we only ever see individual fixed points
  in what is actually an infinitely wide space of possibilities.\r\n\r\nWith digitalisation,
  however, typeface has left its manifest image \u2013 cast in lead \u2013 behind,
  and with it all the associated limitations. Computer-based applications, the Internet
  and new, fluid advertising media allow us to go beyond the existing, static view
  of typography.\r\n\r\nLAIKA is neither bold nor thin, but swings between these two
  extremes. Its form is no longer defined statically, but alters dynamically. As well
  as the font\u2019s weight, the stroke contrast, serif lengths and italic angles
  of the font all behave dynamically too. All these parameters can be driven and influenced
  by a range of inputs, in order to create a typeface that changes constantly in real
  time.\r\n\r\nLAIKA requires a whole new, dynamic understanding of typography.</em>\r\n\r\nhttp://laikafont.ch/About_eng.html\r\nhttp://laikafont.ch/applet/test_eng.html\r\n"
