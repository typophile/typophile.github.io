body: "Does anyone here know this book?\r\n\r\nFull title:\r\nIm Auge des Lesers\r\nFoveale
  und periphere Wahrnehmung: Vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude\r\nHans W. Hunziker,
  Dr. phil., Lernpsychologe\r\n\r\nTranslation:\r\nIn the eye of the reader\r\nFoveal
  and Peripheral Perception: From Letter Recognition to the Joy of Reading\r\n\r\nThe
  book is about: How visual perception functions, what our optical illusions show,
  where the perceptual difficulties associated with driving cars and learning to read
  lie, and how one arrives at a simple love of reading from the first arduous piecing
  together of letters and theirs sounds. [my partial translation]\r\n\r\nFull synopsis
  in German:\r\nWie die visuelle Wahrnehmung funktioniert, was uns optische T\xE4uschungen
  zeigen, wo die Wahrnehmungs-Schwierigkeiten beim Autofahren und Lesenlernen liegen
  und wie man vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude gelangt: Die wichtigsten Forschungsergebnisse
  zu diesen Themen erkl\xE4rt der Autor in einem leicht verst\xE4ndlichen Text, mit
  vielen Wahrnehmungs-Experimenten, \xFCber 170 Abbildungen, 30 Tabellen und ausf\xFChrlichen
  Literaturangaben.\r\n\r\nMy translation has a gloss on \u201Cund wie man vom Buchstabieren
  zur Lesefreude gelangt,\u201D because I learned from the writer's son (the writer
  just died this past summer at 77) that: \"Buchstabieren\" was intended to refer
  to spelling out each letter they way beginners read; \"Lesefreude\" even though
  \"joy of reading\" seem a good literal translation, might just as well be translated
  with \"reading comfort\" or \"ease of reading\". I'd say the best translation would
  be the word average parents would use when referring to what they hope their children
  would reach.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know from readers on this blog what they thought
  of it and some particulars about the content, for example, how does Hunziker see
  the role of parafoveal perception and foveal perception.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of
  buying it.\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: I was going to make a comment about the use of the Comic Sans. I think it
    brings the book down to the level of popular science in an attempt to appeal to
    a general audience. The little reading in it I've done via the gogglebooks preview
    gives a different impression.
