  design. <!--break-->for my final project, duration of 1 academic year, i shall attempt
  to expose the significance of the space in typographic design, starting from exploring
  form & counterform, then moving on to figure & ground, foreground & background and
  finally object & environment. \r\n\r\nseeing as there are many of you who are absolutely
  fanatical about type and design i would greatly appreciate if you could put your
  views across about the importance of space when using type. Also if you have done
  any experimental work on this subject I would be very interested in seeing it. or
  if you have any other information (exhibitions, articles, books etc) that you might
  think it would be useful.\r\n\r\nat present I have done an extensive amount research
  and have read many books. if anyone is keen on this subject i'll be happy to give
  you reading references an other materials i've come across.\r\n\r\ni look forward
  to hearing from you all.\r\n"
