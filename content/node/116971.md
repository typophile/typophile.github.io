    but it\u2019s not Helvetica Ultra Compressed in any case."

  body: Actually R. you are right - Ultra Compressed Helvetica it fits except the
    arm on the r is too long, missed that - Compacta LET has a shorter arm but other
    glyph shapes do not work. It could be something that someone has played with.

    [[http://www.emtype.net/sunday_times_01.php|Sunday Times]], a bespoke typeface
    exclusively designed by Eduardo Manso.\r\nThe closest I have at the moment are
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic|Rama Gothic]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/monopol|Monopol]],
    different in many points but with the right design for Rama Gothic /g (off for
    Compacta and Helvetica Compressed) and /r.\r\nReminds me of also [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview|Knockout]],
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/champion-gothic/characters/|Champion Gothic]]
    and a bit of [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/giorgio/sans|Giorgio Sans]]."

    sample is too tight. Lots of look a likes but not it yet.

    if you almost completely fill the counter on the magazine version _a_ and add
    a little width. Same thing for the magazine version _m_ and the heavy _n_.\r\nDon"
