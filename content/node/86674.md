  body: "This is my first post...\r\n\r\nThere is a website that will help you identify
    serif fonts by way of certain characteristics.  It is only as good as your input
    and of course patience.  :)\r\n\r\nTry this:  http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps a bit even though it is not a complete answer. I got about 2002 results
    after putting in all the info."
