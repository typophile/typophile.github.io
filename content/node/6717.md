body: 'Okay I&#39;ll try this again... <BR>I know there are no current applications
  that support this feature, but it seems that there is a moderate amount of interest
  in random fonts at least from what i read here on these boards. <BR>Anyhow, I&#39;ve
  wondered about the &#34;rand&#34; feature. Would it be set up like:  <BR>sub x from
  [x x.salt1 x.salt2 x.salt3 &#40;etc.&#41;]  <BR>and then the application would randomly
  pick from within that set? or is there a more ideal way that this would be set up?  <BR>unfortunately,
  i doubt any apps will support this feature anytime soon, but it&#39;d be nice to
  know how this feature would be written in theory.'

  body: Yes, you would use GSUB lookup type 3 &#40;one-to-one-of-many&#41; so you
    would map from the default glyph to an enumerated set of possible alternates.
    See the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#rand">&#60;rand&#62;
    feature description</a> in the OT spec for more details.

    the different lookups are/mean somewhere on the Microsoft site too? &#40;sorry,

    with me&#41;
