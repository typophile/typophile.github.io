  taken from <a href="http://www.lanoandwoodley.com" target="_blank">www.lanoandwoodley.com</a>&#41;.
  The font looks very familiar and is used on the television show the adventures of
  lano and woodley. <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28723.gif"

    is part of their General Collection of 50 fonts.

  body: That it is.  But where can I find a download of it?  Let me guess it costs
    about $500 for the entire set <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    fun yourself!

  body: Or there are a ton of freeware fonts like this, because handwritten sloppy
    fonts are the easiest things to create, as Stephen suggested. That Part of the
    Script Guide I mentioned shows many freeware fonts included in with the commercial
    ones. I always try to show only original fonts where I know who designed them
    &#40;anything else is listed under Alias Names&#41;. <BR> <BR>You might also try
    writing to House and seeing if they would sell individual fonts.

  body: Just as a follow up I took my own suggestion and wrote to House Industries.  A
    person wrote back and told me that they think their fonts are properly priced
    and that less than $5 per font in that collection is a very reasonable price.
    She said that they do not, however, sell individual fonts.  <BR> <BR>So when you
    see a House font you like, remember, it&#39;s the whole collection/family or nothing
    when you buy them. <BR> <BR>I gave them my opinon that was only a good deal for
    someone who wants to use all the fonts, but I suppose it is just another marketing
    strategy as you talked about in another thread today with the Lineto fonts.

    made very clear that I was not their intended <BR>market. It is, of course, their
    right to market their products as <BR>they see fit. The tone was extremely arrogant,
    though. Hopefully, <BR>at least they were civil in their response to you Mike.

  body: 'Yves, don&#39;t forget the t-shirt that comes with the $250 set! <BR> <BR>Weren&#39;t
    the fonts in House&#39;s General Collection originally available individually,
    or at least in smaller sets? I do think $250 is way too much for the set -- at
    best you&#39;re probably going to only use any five of the fonts, and probably
    not too often at that, so practically it&#39;s more like $50 a font, and that&#39;s
    not a very good deal. I just bought&#42; Neutraface, and at $199 for one huge
    family I think I got a much better deal than I would have had I bought&#42; the
    General Collection, even though I&#39;d have gotten a t-shirt as well. <BR> <BR>At
    least with the other sets, there&#39;s more of a theme to them &#40;so you&#39;re
    likely to use a majority of the fonts in the set&#41;, as well as a more limited
    number of fonts per set so the price is more reasonable. <BR> <BR>The other thing
    is that back when the fonts in the General Collection were new, House was one
    of the few small foundries that were becoming more widely known, so well-made
    quirky fonts like these were much more rare. Now that the market is more or less
    flooded with them, having them available only as an expensive set seems bad for
    business. With Rich Roat jokingly complaining over at Typographica that making
    their new book put them in the poorhouse, as it were, someone might impress upon
    him the good business sense of offering individual faces at $20-30 a pop. <BR>
    <BR>Just sayin&#39;. <BR> <BR>&#40;Oh, and Seksay: don&#39;t do it, baby -- it&#39;s
    the first step on the road to hell.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;bought an overly
    restrictive license to use, that is. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Mike F., <BR> <BR>Their letter didn&#39;t sound arrogant to me. It was polite
    and brief.  <BR> <BR><i>Sorry, we do sell individual fonts. A lot of work goes
    into the making of quality fonts so we believe our prices are fair. At $250 for
    the collection, and 51 fonts plus clip art, each font in the General Collection
    comes to less than $5. <BR>Best, <BR>Lynn</i> <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s funny,
    almost Freudian, that she omitted the word &#39;not&#39; in the first sentence.
    Clearly it was supposed to be there, from the rest of  the remarks. <BR> <BR>For
    Seksay,  <BR> <BR>Even if what you are planning to use this font for is <i>strictly</i>
    for your own use, I agree with the other comments made advising you against illegal
    copying of the fonts.  You have a better chance to be caught if it&#39;s used
    for commercial purposes, but it&#39;s unethical no matter how you rationalize
    it, in my opinion.

  body: Sorry, I didn&#39;t realise about the policy. <BR> <BR>But you have to admit
    probably 95% of people have some sort of pirated software, music, movies and even
    fonts. <BR> <BR>I am just using the font for my own personal use yes, that is
    why i refuse to pay AU$500 for a whole package of fonts that i&#39;m never even
    going to touch.  I&#39;m just happy i found some sort of copy, but that&#39;s
    just me.
