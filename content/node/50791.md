    further, this info from the finder's guide to the BPL Dwiggins Collection might
    help give you a head start.\r\n\r\nThe relevant material is in Box #72.\r\nUnited
    States Postage Stamp Project:\r\nfolder 24 -- correspondence; \r\nff. 25-26 --
    drawings & sketches;\r\nf. 27 -- postal cards with sketches (annotated);\r\nff.
    28-29 -- photographs of design by other artists;\r\nf. 30 -- memos & clippings
    regarding project;\r\nff. 31-34 -- reference materials.\r\n\r\nBTW, folders just
    after this in the same box are related to the currency project.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."
