  body: Sorry, guys, but the first line is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/arial/arial/testdrive.html?s=Every+Sunday+at+11%3A00AM&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Arial</a>, not Helvetica. <BR> <BR>Look closely at the differences
    of the &#34;1&#34; numerals, as well as the bottom of the lowercase &#34;a&#34;

    target="_blank">Helvetica</a> has a much more noticeable spur.
