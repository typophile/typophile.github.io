  work occasionally with Photoshop and corel draw to create presentations and photo
  compositions. Now I need to create a logo, so which program you recommend? One that
  is powerful and have the right tools, but at the same time is user friendly.\r\n\r\nI
  will appreciate your suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"
