  sample. \r\nIt bears some similarity to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/wichita/bold/charmap.html|Wichita
  TS-Bold]], so perhaps this is M.F. Benton's Wichita? I have not been able to find
  a sample of the metal version of Wichita to confirm.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metal_4056.png]"

  body: It also has similarities to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/itc_cheltenham_std_bold_condensed/">ITC
    Cheltenham</a> though that obviously came later. Love how they dealt with the
    descender problem on the last line.

  body: 'Just to clarify, I mainly just need the name for this typeface, I know there
    is probably no digital version of it. It is for a metal type shop at a school
    where I teach. We have this face only in this weight (and sadly one size), and
    we would love to know the name of it. All of the other metal type has been identified,
    except for this one. If it is any help, most of the other type in the shop seems
    to be predominantly from ATF. Hoping someone out there might recognize it. '

    below the font showing.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=hancock&q=Go\r\n\r\nI'll
    add - I found this thru Identifont. It was nice to have a full character set."
