  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The &ldquo;Typeright&rdquo; website (<a href="http://www.typeright.org">http://www.typeright.org</a>) is an example of how shady American lawyers (here the attorney Leonard DuBoff) disseminate wrong information for the purpose of lobbyism.</p>
<p>E.g., shady lobbyist Leonard DuBoff states as &ldquo;General Counsel&rdquo; at above site:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Under the Berne Convention, one signatory nation agrees to respect the copyrights of every other signatory. The United States is one of these nations. Since most developed countries protect typeface designs, the U.S. is in the strange and paradoxical position of officially respecting the copyright on foreign typeface designs but not its own domestic designs.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Apart from the fact that the statement &ldquo;Most developed countries protect typeface designs&rdquo; is not based on proof, even third-rate American shysters know very well that the Berne Convention is based on the &ldquo;principle of national treatment”. This means that the USA, under the Berne Convention (see RBC, Art. 5, Par. 1), grants to non-nationals (i.e. to foreigners or citizens of other countries) the same copyright protection as it grants to the works of its own nationals (i.e. to domestic United States citizens).</p>
<p>As the USA does not grant copyright protection to the typeface designs of its own nationals, it also does not grant copyright protection to the typeface designs of non-nationals so that e.g. the typeface designs made by Spanish, French, German, etc. designers are not copyrightable in the USA.</p>
<p>The shady lawyer Leonard DuBoff knows that <cite>&ldquo;the U.S. is <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> in the strange and paradoxical position of officially respecting the copyright on foreign typeface designs&rdquo;</cite> and he also knows that he is disseminating wrong information at Typeright, for which site he acts as &ldquo;General Counsel&rdquo; for the purpose of lobbyism.</p>

<p>This so-called lawyer Leonard DuBoff claims:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;The fact that copyright laws in most developed countries provide protection for the typeface designer&hellip; &ldquo;</cite></p>
<p>Is this a fact? No, it is a lie!</p>
<p>You can easily check the falseness of Leonard DuBoff&rsquo;s statement by sending an email to this so-called lawyer (lduboff [at] dubofflaw.com) requesting him to tick off those countries in above list of the 163 RBC member states which - according to this so-called lawyer Leonard DuBoff - provide copyright protection for typeface designs.</p>

<p>By using the phrase “so-called lawyer” you are implying&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pettyfogging, and you know that (&ldquo;pettifogging = paying too much attention to unimportant details&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The only important and decisive question here is the following:</p>
<p>How many of the 163 national copyright laws of the 163 Berne Convention states contain provisions that typeface designs are copyrighted? Are there only two or three states, whose copyright laws contain such typeface design provisions? Or are such typeface design provisions contained in the copyright laws of &ldquo;most developed countries&rdquo;, as Leonard DuBoff claims?</p>
<p>You should know that Leonard DuBoff is totally blind. He will never be able to see your typeface Hypatia, nor any other typeface, and due to his blindness, he could not read the copyright laws of the 162 foreign Berne convention states, except the American copyright law which he could read in Braille script. And Leonard DuBoff, who could never read the copyright laws of foreign states and who never sees any typeface due to his blindness, disseminates the false statement that the copyright laws of &ldquo;most developed countries&rdquo; protect typeface designs, or even all other 162 states except the USA (<cite>&ldquo;Type designers the world over enjoy legal protection for their typefaces - except those working in the United States.&quot;</cite>)</p>
<p>It is deplorable that Leonard DuBoff is totally blind. But this is not an excuse that he disseminates blatant lies at Typeright in order to take the visitors of this website and the members of the American Congress or House of Representatives as the addressees of the petition for a ride (see <a href="http://www.typeright.org/petition.html)">http://www.typeright.org/petition.html)</a>.</p>

<p>@Uli - paying too much attention to unimportant details&hellip; sounds good. Go ask yourself what you are spending your time with - I daresay pettyfogging should be familiar to you.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, claiming that a blind lawyer is unable to read copyright laws of other countries is one of the worst lies I have ever heard of. You do know that we are living in the 21st century, do you? And you are aware of computer programs which actually READ text to you? You do know that blind people no longer need Braille to read?? Oh, and did you ask this &ldquo;so-called lawyer&rdquo; in person if he knows those laws or not? You did not? I hadn&rsquo;t expected. I am quite sure he does - and I would not be astonished to find that they ARE available in Braille. Oh, in case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed - there is a Braille terminal which transforms normal text into Braille on the fly. These blind people read like HELL, OKAY?</p>
<p>I think you are disgusting, mocking a blind man and claiming that he cannot do his job right because of his blindness. And your proof is? I don&rsquo;t see any proof - and I&rsquo;m not blind! You should be ashamed of yourself!</p>

<p>It is not my job to prove <cite>“Most developed countries protect typeface designs”</cite>, because I did not disseminate this blatant lie.</p>

Algeria
Andorra

Armenia etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>he promulgates his blatant lie that type designers in these countries enjoy legal protection for their typefaces.</p>

<p>Sorry - but you are not worth talking to. Have a nice life. And listen - how about spending it somewhere else, hmmm? I read somewhere that you actually had plans to leave this community. Please do so.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh my god - now you&rsquo;ve got me! A learned man, mighty in old, dead, and foreign tongues, hath spoken, so my argument is void. He that claimeth that someone is a shady character, thereby insulting him and making fun of his blindness by claiming that said person cannot read, may do so, without proof, provided that he knoweth enough Latin.</p>
<p>Oh no, wait! I actually can speak the damn language myself. <em>slap</em></p>
<p>So in case you thought you could just ignore my argument (since I am undoubtedly right, and your behaviour highly unethical), and instead silence me by acting the superior intellectual, spouting Latin phrases you picked up somewhere - without REALLY knowing what it means - and of course not translating them in order to prove me being the small-and-meek, then you are&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; mistaken. Dulce et decorum est, pro typographia mori :-)</p>
<p>Now, just to get you silenced: Yes, it is a general rule that the party who alleges the affirmative of any proposition shall prove it. In court. Okay? IN COURT!</p>
<p>An example: if I claim in court that a font is a forgery (I heard this is a favorite word of yours, so I use this example just for you), I need to prove it, otherwise my argument is worthless, and the judge will not accept it. However, as you very well know, I can claim this on my website until doomsday - until there is someone PROVING that I am false, there is no way in hell to stop me from claiming it. You should know this, as I can see that your website is full of correct as well as very wrong accusations of this sort. Be glad that those companies take you for harmless, and leave you alone. It is called freedom of speech, by the way. Should I say this in Latin, so that it sounds better and impresses some idiot? Naw, better not.</p>
<p>Now, taking your own legal argument, you here claim something without being able to prove it, so you are breaking the law you claim to rest on. You are claiming that what this lawyer says is not true (by the way, nowhere is it said that this is a legal text of any way) without having proof. The stuff on his site is information, and as such, may be wrong, exaggerated, correct, dumb, wishful thinking, twiddlestick, satire, fake, stupid, cum grano salis (mean, am I) or simpy biased - there is a lot of information out there on the internet like this. Your website, for example.</p>
<p>So, in dubio pro reo, smart aleck. You had no proof, but nevertheless started yapping. And now you are trying to get out of it by saying that the person you were yapping about should have proven what he&rsquo;s yapping about before yapping. Heh, before asking others do obey the law, how about doing it yourself?</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you go and try to do the smart one on me. If you come up with Sanskrit next time, I&rsquo;ll give you some Klingon to think about! Now shut up and stop posting rubbish, UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE IT! And even if proved, please think about one thing before you post: is anyone likely to be interested in it?</p>
<p>Oh, and never again claim that anyone who is blind cannot have read anything, because of his blindness. I happen to have blind friends, and I love them dearly. They read more than I do, and we often talk about books. They are very book-learned, and they do their jobs fine. So never ever again claim that someone cannot do their job because he or she cannot read. That is plain dumb! Either admit it, or go away!</p>

<p>Ei incumbit probatio, qui dicit, non qui negat.</p>
<p>This means: It is NOT my job to prove “Most developed countries protect typeface designs”, because I did not disseminate this blatant lie. Although I do NOT have the onus probandi, I COULD prove that this blatant lie is a blatant lie.</p>
<p>The first country in the above list of the 163 Berne Convention countries is Albania. The following text proves that the Albanian copyright law does not protect typeface designs.</p>
<p>We could continue with the copyright law of Algeria, then with the copyright law of Andorra, then of Antigua, then of Argentina, then of Armenia etc. etc. etc. After having read all these copyright laws of all Berne Convention countries, it will become evident that Leonard DuBoff&rsquo;s statement“Most developed countries protect typeface designs” is a blatant lie.</p>
<hr>

</ol>
<p>The Ownership of the Copyright on Works of Joint Authorship</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>The co-authors of a work of joint authorship are the first co-owners of the moral and economic rights of this work. But, if this work can be divided into parts (i.e. if its parts can be reproduced, stored or used separately), the co-authors have the independent rights for these parts of the work, maintaining the co-ownership of the rights for the common work.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ownership of the Copyright on Collective Works</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>The owner of the moral and economic rights of a collective work will be the physical person or the legal entity on whose initiative and direction the work was created and whose name appears as the author of the work.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ownership of the Copyright on the Works Created
on an Employment Contractual Basis</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>If the work is created by an author for a physical person or a legal entity (hereinafter referred to as “employer”) on an employment contractual basis and during employment period, the first owner of the moral and economic rights will be the author, unless the contract provides otherwise. The economic rights of such a work will be considered transferred to the employer at the required extent for the proper activities that the employer accomplishes at the time the work is created.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ownership of the Copyright for Audiovisual Works</p>
<p>26.4 The producer of the audiovisual work will be the natural or juridical person that undertake the initiative to create the work.</p>
<p>The contract between the producer and the compositor and the others authors of an audiovisual work provides for the transfer to the producer of the right to use of the audiovisual work, without prejudice to the moral and economic rights of the author.</p>

</ol>
<p>In case of an anonymous or pseudonymous work, the editor, whose name appears in the work has the responsibility to represent the author, and when there are no contrary facts, he has the right to protect the author and ask the enforcement of the author’s right.

<p>Presuming of the Producer’s Right</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>The natural or juridical person, whose name appears on an audiovisual work as the producer of this work, will be considered the producer of such a work if there are no facts to contradict this.</li>

<ol start="30">
<li>The author of a work may issue a license to third persons to perform activities which are included in his economic rights. These licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive.</li>
</ol>
<p>The non-exclusive license enables the licensee the right to perform activities related to the author and to other licensees according to the rules.</p>
<p>Exclusive license enables the licensee the right to perform activities which exclude others, even of the author itself, according to the rules.</p>
<p>No license can be considered as a non-exclusive one apart from cases when it is expressly defined in the contract between the licensee and the author.</p>
<p>Form of Contracts for Transfers and Licenses</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Contracts for transferring the economic rights as well as the exclusive licenses, for performing activities included in the economic rights, are made in a written form.</li>

<ol start="32">
<li>The transfer of the economic rights and licenses, for performing activities included in the economic rights, can be limited to the performance of some specific activities as well as to the time period, purpose, territorial extension, width and the ways and means of usage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that the name of the territory in which the economic rights are transferred or the license is given to act according to the economic rights, is not mentioned is considered as a limitation of the transfer or the license within the territory in which the transfer is made.</p>
<p>The fact that the extension, ways and means of usage for which the transfer of the economic rights is made or the license to act according to the economic rights is granted, is not mentioned, is considered a limitation of the transfer or the license to the extension, ways and means of usage, that are necessary for the provided purpose at the time when the right of transfer or the license is granted.</p>

<p>What do you want from us?</p>
<p>Why do you care about these topics?</p>
<p>I ask because it seems you are completely uninvolved with type making, marketing or use, and it also seems that you have no regard for anyone who is involved. So I don&rsquo;t understand your basic motivation.</p>
<p>Besides that, your strident, accusing tone and unrealistic and flawed logic make your posts unpleasant and pointless to read. Nobody needs the entire text of any country&rsquo;s copyright law posted here. Consider what Typophile is for, and whether your diatribes really have a place here.</p>
<p>For perspective, consider whether you would be satisfied to be involved in the film, garment, food, automotive, electronics or pharmaceutical industries, or in government. Do you imagine any of them to be pure, holy oases of moral rectitude? You do not have a right to expect perfect ethical consistency from the type industry, and you do not have a right to expect Typophile to support you or provide answers, especially when you have such vague goals, so little direct involvement, and such a bad attitude.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You really are a cutie. Let&rsquo;s keep on ignoring other people&rsquo;s points, since they are uncomfortably true, and let&rsquo;s just go on harping about something nobody cares about.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t get it, so let me put it simple: This is not about the shady lawyer&rsquo;s website anymore. It is about YOU and your inacceptible behaviour! This is no way to post things, especially when we&rsquo;re talking about accusations!</p>
<ol>
<li>You claim somebody is a blatant liar</li>
<li>When asked if you have proof for such a harsh accusation, you state that you do NOT have proof, and furthermore that YOU DO NOT NEED PROOF! You are elligible to call anyone a blatant liar because YOU think or imagine that this is so.</li>
<li>When pressed hard, you finally start your first efforts to prove your point, still insisting on the fact that you can call someone a blatant liar in public without a shred of proof, although you claim that you COULD prove it, although you STILL haven&rsquo;t done so.</li>
<li>Since impressing people with Latin did not work, you post a long legal text in the hope of making people shut up. Since the text is from 1992 and covers just one country, no one is impressed.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is your way of arguing which is sickening. Let me just turn this around:</p>
<ol>
<li>I call you a blatant liar because of something you say on your website.</li>
<li>When challenged, I say it is not my job to prove it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would you like it? WOULD YOU LIKE IT? And I am quite sure I can prove it, I just have to browse through your website and then do a little research, but actually, why should I, when it is so much more comfortable to simply claim it BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT?! Hey, you are a shady liar! A blatant forger! Wow, that felt good! And furthermore, you have freckles and talk with a Danish accent. And wasn&rsquo;t that you I saw with this prostitute last night? PROOF? Sheesh, who needs it?</p>
<p>Do you really REALLY think you are such a great chap when you walk around claiming things without really knowing? Do you know how these people are called?</p>
<p>And one more thing, you despicable Mr. Righteous:</p>
<p>&ldquo;due to his blindness, he could not read the copyright laws of the 162 foreign Berne convention states&rdquo;</p>
<p>is a way of arguing which will definitely cause you to get hurt, should I ever meet you. So blind people cannot do their job because they cannot read anything. Can you hear yourself talking? HELLO?? HELLOOOO? ANYBODY HOME? Stop ignoring that your way of arguing is</p>
<p>a. wrong
b. not acceptable to anyone I know
c. probably not even acceptable to yourself, should anyone use this method on you</p>
<p>If I were a mod here, and you should thank god that I&rsquo;m not, I would delete each and every post from you which claims something and insults somebody without being able to prove it.</p>
<p>Please, go away. No one wants to talk to you here. Learn how to argue properly. Don&rsquo;t come back until you&rsquo;ve learnt it.</p>

You do not even consider that you might have done something wrong, do not take into consideration any point brought up in a discussion, but simply go on rambling, feeling mighty grand. Blahblahblah.</p>
<p>One last try, before I give up on you!</p>
<p>What about:</p>
<ol>
<li>I accuse someone, but I do not have proof. Is this okay?</li>
<li>I claim blind people are not being able to read. Is this ethical?</li>
<li>I call something a blatant lie, but actually don&rsquo;t know, but just assume. Is this correct?</li>
<li>I state that something published on a website is a binding fact, referring to onus probandi, although websites by their nature are in no legal way bound to give facts, and the legal phrase of onus probandi does not apply here. Am I doing the right thing?</li>
<li>When people oppose me, I ignore their objections, such as the above questions, but keep on repeating my point, trying to find ways out of the argument, which I de facto lost. Am I a nice person?</li>
<li>You post things on a forum. The majority of community members tell you to stop doing it, because they either don&rsquo;t believe you, don&rsquo;t care what you write about, or don&rsquo;t like the way you write it. Should you ignore them and go on annoying them, or should you reconsider?</li>
<li>You have nothing to do with type, and many people here, renowned designers and type specialists, have told you to get some education before talking about something you do not fully understand. Should you ignore them, or could they maybe have a point?</li>
<li>You state that you publish all this stuff so that prosecutors can use it to bring these blatant cases before the courts. Has this ever happened? If not, could you think of a reason? Are all those prosecutors lazy - or maybe, just a slight possibility, could it be that they think your wrong?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please answer each question, using the according number.</p>
<p>Oh and &hellip;. I don&rsquo;t feel any pathological hatred. I pity you. You must have a boring life. It&rsquo;s too bad you picked our scene to hanf around. I think the shady forgers in the motorcycle scene are nice, too. Go and tell those Honda bikers over there that it is a blatant lie that their bike is an original - it is a forged Harley!! Go tell &lsquo;em. :-)</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;. somehow I begin to get an idea why Uli decided to wreck the nerves of us type people. We are just too nice. We need some type hooligans :-))</p>

<p>I certainly do not consider myself a legal expert but Leonard DuBoff is.  He been highly respected in the field for some 30 years and I have personally known him for more than 20 years.  The suggestion that Mr. DuBoff is a &ldquo;shady lobbyist&rdquo; is without merit, as is calling him a &ldquo;shady lawyer.&rdquo;  While he has testified before Congress (in favor of the adoption of the Visual Artists Rights Act long before a weak version was adopted), he is not a lobbyist, nor is he shady.  (Perhaps Uli should be reminded that casting aspersions on one&rsquo;s character, especially in relationship to the subject&rsquo;s profession, is defamatory.)</p>
<p>As to Mr. DuBoff&rsquo;s &ldquo;cryptic email,&rdquo; I suspect that his response was no more puzzling than the correspondence he received.  If he denies being TypeRight&rsquo;s General Counsel for the past 10 years, then he hasn&rsquo;t been.  Further, Mr. DuBoff is not responsible for the content of TypeRight&rsquo;s website (if he were, would he list an out-of-date weblink for himself)?</p>
<p>It is true that Leonard cannot see a typeface.  Further, contrary to Uli&rsquo;s assertion, he cannot read Braille.  Braille is a two-handed language and, sadly, the chemical explosion that robbed Leonard of his sight also took one of his hands.  The accident did not, however, deprive him of his fine mind and remarkable memory.  Leonard remembers color and form, and can describe in detail every piece of art in his office and home, regardless of the medium, 2-D or 3-D.  Before the accident, Leonard had been a Marine, an engineer and an artist.  After his recovery, he attended law school, graduating summa cum laude.  Leonard was one of the founders of the legal specialty of art law, writing the first textbook on the subject (The Desk Book of Art Law) more than 20 years and several related works.  He has authored more than 30 books on legal subjects, for lawyers, professionals and consumers.</p>
<p>I do not think that Leonard is infallible (any more than I or any of you) but I suggest that Uli not believe everything he reads (or thinks).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Playground_Girl - it was I who assumed that Mr. DuBoff - being a blind man - would probably be reading Braille, since all of my blind friends do so. I did not know about his hand. However, I am quite sure that he nevertheless has his means to &ldquo;read&rdquo; a text, using something like ViaVoice.</p>
<p>Uli simply denies that blind people have the capability of reading, i.e. understanding things which are not communicated orally, which slightly (!) infuriated me.</p>
<p>I do not know Mr. DuBoff, but I principally do not like the accusation of blind people being &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; to people who are lucky enough to have sight.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Leonard DuBoff, General Counsel&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>was NOT removed by the administrator of the TypeRight website.</p>
<p>I think the &ldquo;Playground Girl&rdquo; is barking up the wrong tree:</p>
<p>If it were true that Leonard DuBoff has never been the &ldquo;General Counsel&rdquo; of this TypeRight website since 1997, why has Leonard DuBoff never objected to being declared as the &ldquo;General Counsel&rdquo; of this TypeRight website during the past 10 years (1997-2008)?</p>
<p>Why has Leonard DuBoff never sued this TypeRight website to remove this so-called &ldquo;false declaration&rdquo; during the past 10 years?</p>
<p>Why does the above &ldquo;Playground Girl&rdquo; not request the administrator of <a href="http://www.typeright.org">www.typeright.org</a> to declare at this TypeRight website that the &ldquo;General Counsel: Leonard DuBoff&rdquo; declaration has always been a &ldquo;false declaration&rdquo; during the past 10 years?</p>
