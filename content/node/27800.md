  all clearly visible on the silver screen. The movie has a naive, dreamlike, melancholy
  feel to it. The graphics that i'm making should have a gdr/postwar communist era,
  washed out look.\r\n\r\nFor these tasks, I'm looking for some really dull fonts.
  I mean dull like helvetica, not like arial. Fonts that try to be fancy, but fail.
  I'd also appreciate som input on how to make display type look boring without being
  ugly. THanks!\r\n\r\nbest regards, \r\n\r\nalex"

  body: "Helvetica is dull? And Arial is better? I don't agree with you. Helvetica
    can be wonderfully radiant and exciting in the right context. Just take a look
    at the lighter weights of Helvetica Neue - positively glamorous. Personally I
    find Optima very dull but many people love it. Same thing with a lot of the \"novelty\"
    typefaces from the 70s and 80s.\r\n\r\nI think almost any type can look dull -
    it's just a matter of how you use it. Maybe something like Block Gothic is what
    you're looking for? Or a stencilled typeface? Or a typewriter one, like Courier
    - that really says \"dull\" to me. 1950s office dull and bureucratic."

    dull depending on how it is used. Its an impossible question to answer, everyone
    has different opinions. \r\n\r\nI suggest that you turn your brief around, instead
    of looking for dull fonts, (which we just discussed, may not actually exist),
    maybe you could use any old font and just treat it in a very dull way. A dull
    font is often dull due to the unispiring way it is being used, a way in which
    adds nothing to the context it is put in. \r\n\r\nI personally find a lot of the
    hand scribbled destructive fonts quite dull but that is only me opinion. \r\n\r\nGood

    this movie. Dull\" fonts\" like helvetica?? \r\n\r\nTypefaces like Helvetica and
    Univers are purposely void of personality.. that is why they were made. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    if you re-wrote your question one could give help. By dull do you mean that it
    is a sign from the 50's that is fading away. Then look at old signs from that
    era and mimic that. \r\n\r\nI've worked on signs/props for big name motion pictures,
    and trust me just from your question you may not be cut out for this. Theres a
    lot more than just finding a typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I come off as a jerk,
    but you clearly have a lot to learn.  Try doing some research on what signs would
    have been around during that time, maybe they weren't even typefaces.....maybe
    they were hand painted just to a roman style. Who knows?\r\n\r\nBembo"
