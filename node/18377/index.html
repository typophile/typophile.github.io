<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've noticed recently that the bowl of the lower-case "a" in Arial feels very squished, especially at small sizes. Yet I believe I've seen other faces with a similar squished bowl. What's your opinion? (The image below was made in Photoshop with "sharp" anti-aliasing-- the small sizes are a bit inky, but you get the shape about right).

<div class=commentbody>You might have a hard time getting anyone to critique Arial seriously. Yes, it does appear squished, the top of the bowl is a little thick/unrefined.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Eric! That does help, as does the link. I teach professional communication and document design, but from a rhetoric background, not a graphic design or typography background. I think I have a pretty decent eye and have worked hard to learn a lot. But it is very helpful to have some expert perspectives that can help back me up in telling students -- in precise terms -- why some typefaces are just nasty. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Some major differenced explained here:
http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html
The squished appearance most likely has to do with how it is hinted. Hinting is a process that adds instructions and other data to help render a font at low resolutions. Generally, the effect is to distort the shape of the letters to better fit the pixel grid, retaining enough of the shape to keep it recognizable (as an "a" in this case), but not necessarily accurately displaying the real shape, which isn't possible at low resolution anyway.
For what it's worth, Arial is probably one of the most intensively hinted fonts in existence. The problem is, the basic design (derived from Helvetica) is not well suited to on-screen display, especially at small sizes (also true of Helvetica, or any print-centric font). You can't say they haven't tried, though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Photoshop's sharp/crisp/strong/smooth options ignore the font's hinting, being based on a "plain" rasterization of the font's outline.
You can see this by doing manual kerning, and watching how the vertical stem changes.
The "none" option shows the hinting.
In fact, Arial can probably get away with having a heavy central crossbar because it is so extensively hinted, and designed more for PC monitor display than being used in Photoshop.
Faces which have a markedly thinner central crossbar to the "e" and "a", such as Gill Sans, fare better in the kind of test you're doing.

<div class=commentbody>Interesting. I've known about hinting, but hadn't considered it wrt to this issue.
One contrast, perhaps a false dichotomy, that comes up a lot in my field is something like "artful vs. useful." I.e., the old form vs. function question, and it doesn't lead anywhere-- obviously you want both in some degree, depending on the situation. But as a matter of teaching students a professional practice, it can be a Sisyphian battle to get them to think outside the "workhorse" typefaces, like Arial and TNR, without getting all goofy with fonts (you know, "but prof, I LIKE 12-point Comic Sans in my 2.25-in wide columns on my newsletter").
Plus even the experts in my field at times point out the "servicability" of super-common workhorse fonts-- citing, e.g., studies that show that compared to similar serifed fonts, TNR degrades the least through multiple generations of copies. And others think using utterly awful type is just "fun." Grrr!
Although, to be fair, these are very broad-brush generalizations. Part of the issue is simply that I happen to have an "arty" as well as "spatioanalytical" background, and many of my colleagues simply do not. I get into this stuff.</div>
