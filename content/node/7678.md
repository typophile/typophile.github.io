body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a book design and layout and am using --surprise,
  surprise-- Mrs. Eaves. But I am finding it really loosely set. I&#39;m second-guessing
  my choice of type, but I&#39;ve already started setting it. Is it totally wrong
  to track the entire text to make it a bit tighter. Or am I just used to tight type?
  I would appreciate any help! <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    <BR>If you must use Mrs Eaves, your choices are to either respace by hand yourself
    &#40;not easy&#41; or use InDesign, which has an &#34;optical spacing&#34; feature
    that helps badly-spaced fonts tremendously. <BR> <BR>Or you could use another
    font, like The Foundry&#39;s Wilson. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Thanks for the validation! I am using InDesign and had it set on Optical,
    but noticed that Metrics sets it quite a bit tighter. I&#39;ve usually stood by
    the optical feature, but do you think it could be better to go metrics on this
    one. <BR> <BR>Thanks again! <BR>Sona

  body: '&#62; Metrics sets it quite a bit tighter. <BR> <BR>Strange - unless you&#39;re
    using a pretty small point size. <BR>This, because optical spacing depends on
    point size &#40;the smaller the looser&#41;. <BR> <BR>The problem with Mrs Eaves
    isn&#39;t that it&#39;s too loose or tight &#40;although it is a bit the former
    to my eyes&#41;, it&#39;s that the spacing is sloppy. This is what InDesign is
    supposed to fix, and usually -but not always- does. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Sona, are you using story pallet? That can make the spacing more acceptable.

  body: 'Sona, forget about the Metrics spacing: go for Optical and  <BR>track until
    you approximate the general spacing of Metrics  <BR>if you think Optical is too
    wide. Metrics will get you nowhere  <BR>as the built-in spacing generally sucks
    big time. <BR> <BR>Mrs. Eaves is typically hard to set right, but when you succeed  <BR>it
    is very rewarding. It&#39;s just a shame it is so overused.'

  body: /i{Why is the spacing sloppy?} <BR> <BR>yeah? why is it sloppy? is it something
    that could be fixed with some good spacing and some kerning or is it something
    inherent in the design? &#40;i&#39;ve been wondering on this for a while&#41;

  body: '&#62; Why is the spacing sloppy? <BR> <BR>You mean why do I say it&#39;s
    sloppy? <BR>For one thing take a look at the &#34;the&#34;... <BR>Robin Kinross
    has described Mrs Eaves as a &#34;loose bicycle&#34;.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Paul: There&#39;s
    nothing in the design that makes it particularly hard to space well. <BR> <BR>So
    I guess the answer to the question &#34;why&#34; is simply bad craft. Fortunately
    it&#39;s a charming lady of a font otherwise, and luckily we have InDesign to
    get rid of its speech impediment. But it still does have to be set on the large
    side, because of its vertical proportions. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'so my next question is: <BR>why doesn&#39;t Emigre do anything about the
    sloppy spacing? they&#39;ve got to be aware of it, it comes up every time someone
    mentions using this face. why wouldn&#39;t they go back and correct a problem
    such as this?'

  body: Emigre released an OpenType version with a bunch of improvements.  I wonder
    if they fixed the spacing in it.
