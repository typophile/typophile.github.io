  text. This font doesn't render well on resolution on the web site and my client
  asked me to get something similar, that would work.\r\n\r\nAny ideas of what replacement
  font I can look at, and most likely work?\r\n\r\nThank you."

    just type the replacement font in caps. Thanks.

      Sometimes there is a correlation between quality and price, sure. This was free

  body: "\"Would you have made it better if it were not free?\" seems backwards. I'm
    also slightly skeptical about to which extent there is a correlation between quality
    and price. It's certainly an implied correlation, but you have many deviations
    in practice. Hrant, I think finck was right to correct you when you said the main
    reason it doesn't render well is because it's free. I suppose in most cases one
    would ask money for a font which has been properly hinted and optimized, but this
    isn't always the case and it doesn't make your statement inherently true.\r\n\r\nI
    also wouldn't necessarily say a font is poorly made when it doesn't render well
    on the web. Many fonts are simply not optimized for the web. People love Helvetica,
    but if there is one font which renders horribly on the web in a Windows environment..."

    should you get MDR-resistant TB, you wouldn't' let Paul Farmer treat you? In fact,
    they should take away his medical license, right? So much free care means he's
    gotta be incompetent, in spite of the thousands saved!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, and yet,
    you're on record as stating you prefer to check books out of the library rather
    than  buy them. Aren't author's worthy of their royalties?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Charles, I'm also not following your logic.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    main reason it doesn't render well is that it's free.</cite>\r\n\r\nBasic principles
    of any system of logic. (1) It must be sound. It's sound if, and only if, everything
    provable in the system is also true. (2) It must be complete. A system is complete
    if, and only if, everything that is true is provable in the system.\r\n\r\nSo,
    either way, counterexamples have weight. I guess the Wikipedia account of Paul
    Farmer doesn't give any hint of how much he's given without any monetary compensation,
    but the expertise is surely chronicled. <cite>Mountains Beyond Mountains</cite>
    is worth reading, not only for how much Farmer's given without financial motivation,
    but how, amongst other things, he changed WHO doctrine on treating resistant TB.
    And AIDS. The Wikipedia entry on the book, perhaps paradoxically, gives a better
    hint about the man: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_Beyond_Mountains\r\n\r\nIf
    Dr. Farmer has a net worth of only $10,000 after 40 years of work, I wouldn't
    be surprised.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe Hrant's <cite>logic</cite> is that the only successful
    motivation for good work amongst <strong>font designers</strong> is money. Perhaps,
    in his system, other people can  have acceptable non-financial motivations, and
    be successful. That didn't come through, though.\r\n\r\nEven if that is the system:
    Now, Hrant, when informed that there was soon to be a new book by Rich Hendel,
    with a chapter by Kent Lew, remarked that he would not buy it. If he read it,
    he'd check it out from the library. So the author -- Hendel, in this case -- isn't
    going to get any payment, even if Hrant reads it. No \"advances against royalties\"
    for most academic work, you know. \r\n\r\nQED, Hendel & Lew have done bad work,
    so judged by the monetary decision, before reading. Or perhaps because Hendel
    is a book rather than font designer, he's allowed the exception. Poor Kent.\r\n\r\nIt
    probably will come as no surprise that I admire Farmer more than Papazian. But
    I also believe there is good work done with open source fonts, and that the motivations
    for such are not always misplaced.\r\n\r\n"
