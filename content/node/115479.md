  at the attached screenshot).\r\nI have tried to create the letters in FL, but that's
  impossible.\r\nI need a tool, where I can import a whole .otf or .ttf-font, and
  then made my color-addings ...\r\nIn advance, thanks for any help :-)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMorten"

    EST/2000CEST \r\nRegister with this link: https://www.anymeeting.com/AccountManager/RegEv.aspx?PIID=EA52DD89804B3B
    \ (Note: don't register using Safari on Mac. Some wacky bug. sigh.)\r\n\r\nColor
    fonts are here!\r\nUntil recently, computer fonts were digital imitations of traditional
    monochrome typefaces. However, since 2013, it's been possible to create OpenType
    fonts with glyphs that have multiple colors. They don't work everywhere yet, but
    where they do work, they're really spectacular. Think real calligraphy...corporate
    logos... icons... 3D letterforms or letters with visible brush strokes!\r\n\r\nIn
    this webinar, FontLab's Adam Twardoch will show you how to create color fonts
    using BitFonter 3, FontLab Studio 5 and TransType 4 - from an alphabet written
    with a watercolor paint brush on a sheet of paper all the way to an OpenType font
    that works in Apple Keynote and Pages on Mac OS X!\r\n\r\nIn order to get the
    most from this webinar you will need BitFonter, FontLab Studio, and TransType
    4. To make it easy for you Fontlab is offering BitFonter at an unprecedented 80%
    discount (your cost =US$99) to registrants. In addition if you don't already have
    FontLab Studio or TransType 4 we'll give you a 50% discount on those products.
    That's a potential US$773 savings on the whole bundle.\r\n\r\nThere are a limited
    number of seats available for this webinar, so don't be disappointed - register
    early.\r\n\r\nColor Font Webinar\r\n22 April 2014\r\n9 am PST / 12 noon EST /
    20:00 CEST\r\nRegister with this link: https://www.anymeeting.com/AccountManager/RegEv.aspx?PIID=EA52DD89804B3B

  body: "I venture to suggest FL Studio is not required if you won't add OT features
    or kerning or somehow change the output from TransType.\r\nStrictly speaking it
    is possible to achieve the result using only BitFonter 3 and TransType 4.\r\n\r\nJohnych"

  body: I'm joining today's webinar (looking for some better solutions to iOS type
    I've been developing for Apps), but I have to say it's disappointing that BitFonter
    still has not been upgraded to 10.7+ and it appears that FontLab still recommends
    a wonky workaround from 2011.

  body: "I came here to ask for tools to create Apple's SBIX and Google's CBDT/CBLC
    fonts with. I figured I might as well post in this thread!\r\n\r\nI don't see
    these formats mentioned at BitFonter, and TransType 4 doesn't seem to export these
    when you use their layering tool to create colored glyphs. (Although TransType
    converts the layered Microsoft approach to SVG.)\r\n\r\nI would like to create
    a simple one-character font that I can use to check browser support for SBIX and
    CBDT/CBLC. Anybody interested in helping me out?\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong>
    I tried Behdad's scripts to create fonts that should be compatible with Google's
    method (and work on Android and Linux). The script is [[https://github.com/behdad/color-emoji|on
    Github]]. I created the FruityGirl and Funkster fonts with the included script,
    but they don't work on Android. Anybody know what's going on?\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit2:</strong>
    I also tried Jens Kutilek's script to generate fonts with Apple's SBIX table,
    according to [[http://typophile.com/node/103268|this thread]], but the generated
    fonts don't show up on test devices through Browserstack :("
