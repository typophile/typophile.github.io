  using Woodcarver and Rosewood. I need something for the fine print that looks like
  Woodcarver Normal...but is much easier to read in a small size. Although I am open
  to suggestion if something else would go better with those two Display typefaces.\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance!"

  body: Well I'd personally avoid woodcarver (assuming you're talking about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/carver/">ICG
    Carver</a>). It doesn't fit the mold of old letterpressed woodtype and it's pretty
    illegible at any size. I think <a href="http://www.cornerbakery.com/">Corner Bakery</a>
    does a decent job of incorporating different faces for a rustic quasi-show card
    feel. Perhaps combine Rosewood & Rosewood Fill with some other woodtype faces
    like <a href="http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=83">Brothers</a>, <a href="http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=86">Council</a>,
    or some of the <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=searchFonts&type=category&cat=theme&code=old-west">Adobe
    woodtypes</a>

  body: "Nope it is a very nice script font...I agree ICG Carver is icky. I need a
    feminine font since it is a wedding invite for a chef and her blue-grass husband.
    \r\n\r\nHere is the woodcarver font...see it's nice big, but lousy small.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.free-fonts-ttf.org/true-type-fonts/woodcarver-normal-2586-download.htm"

  body: "On a side note, I hope you are fixing the spacing problems of \"Woodcarver.\"
    Pleasant letterforms, but the spacing is badly broken, especially the \"d\" and
    \"f\"....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas...thanks for the great tip. Since there is so little copy on this
    I am pretty much hand kerning it all. i did however notice what you mean on the
    d...very odd...I also had to bring the dot on the i closer to the i.\r\n\r\nYou
    sound like a man who would have a great typeface suggestion I could use with these
    two fonts (woodcarver is dominant with rosewood playing a lesser role...but the
    details of the event (rehearsal dinner) are unreadable even in in 11pt.\r\n\r\nthanks!"
