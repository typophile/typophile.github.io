  body: "@Jean Paul Beumer: You may suggest I read those, but your suggestion goes
    up in flames. Here on the internet the mob rules. Typophile's custodians are toothless
    and not even watching, and they don't care what happens. Nobody is at the wheel.
    You're riding in a driverless bus packed with idiots and a few bright sparks.\r\n\r\nCourtesy
    is appropriate for people who make an effort. Robert Digito, an American and a
    lazy, lazy little boy, has his effortless future mapped out for him. But he has
    a bad habit of leaning on people. Typohpile's best and brightest would not answer
    his question. Only idiots like Jean come to his rescue.\r\n\r\nJean every time
    you tell me off makes me stronger. It has the opposite effect to your intent.
    You're feeding me. Thank you for feeding me. I don't know what I would have done
    if I had remained on those hot coals, burning my pretty flesh."
