  about what it is? I've ran it through whatthefont and no luck

  body: Sure it's strange, it seems to me like someone took Avenir, narrowed the M
    and threw in a (flipped) Century Gothic S just because...

  body: Pretty sure the "S" is not upside down. If you draw it so that the top a bottom
    are exactly the same size, that's how it will look. Flip it over and it will look
    the same.

  body: "@Mark: yes, I thought that about the S (I was just dramatizing about the
    flipping ;-)\r\nSo we can suppose this is the work of an amateur who wanted to
    try his/her own version of geometric caps."
