  body: "Stamped tags? If so probably not made from a conventional font.\r\nGood matches
    for appearance are two fonts based on engraving systems. Lineto's Gravur Condensed
    http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/ and Optimo's
    Gravostyle Basic http://optimo.ch/typefaces_Gravostyle-Basic_all_CharacterMap.html
    Only major difference that I spotted is the open top 4 and the tails on 6 & 9.
    There are other engraving/machine plotting fonts, but they are generally wider
    than the letters on the tags, particularly for O, C etc. which usually are rounded
    without the parallel stroke section on the sides.\r\nDon\r\n"
