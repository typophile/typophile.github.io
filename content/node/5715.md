body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>does anyone know who designed/modified the Swiss Re fonts &#40;Swiss
  Re Sans&#41;, a derivate of Univers. Also, I believe that 1995 Swiss Re had a CI
  update by some London design agency. Does anyone know who this agency was? <BR>
  <BR>Many thanks in advance. <BR>Bruno Maag <BR>Dalton Maag Ltd

    <BR> <BR>Would that mean that Otl Aicher designed Swiss Re Sans? I&#39;m not too
    sure, but it could be a lead.
