body: "The sans underneath Pacifica looks like a smoothed out version of URW Metropolitaines
  inspired of the subway type of old Paris. At first I though it was just a secondary
  logo but this type is consistent across the entire product line.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/metropolitaines/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pacificacandles.com/body.asp\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helpin' a brotha' out,\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :o)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/body-photostrip_5796.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pacificafrench_5774.jpg]"
