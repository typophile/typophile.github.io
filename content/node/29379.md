    maybe that gives you a new direction?

    hand?

  body: I worked with an interior designer who had focused handwriting that very much
    reminded me of Enviro and Tekton. I'm not saying this is hand-lettered, all of
    the E(s) match, but it isn't beyond the realmn of possibility.

    me. I recognized that typical S, but the rest of the face didn't seem to match."

  body: "You know how we are always telling people how easy and cheap it is to make
    a font from hand printing. Seems like an architects lettering is made to order
    for making into a font. I think the similar letters to Enviro reflect a simple,
    quick lettering style -- using only a straight and curved stroke for the S is
    efficient, as is the back-slanted crossbar on the A. As a one-time architecture
    student, I recall how good you can get at quickly lettering in capitals. I think
    this is probably a font made from Gehry's lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
