  body: "Aha! Also, many thanks for the tidbit of the aka name Oscar. It was originally
    an Aldo Novarese design! I just knew it was good!\r\nI saw it used as the caption
    font on the Fox News late night comedy chat show \"Red Eye\", The shots I took
    off the tv screen are here:\r\nhttp://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont1.jpg\r\nhttp://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont2.jpg\r\n\r\nNo
    shots of the lower case, but when I saw that used in the tv show's captions it
    only served to make me more interested to find out what font it was.\r\n\r\nAgain
    - thank you Mark! \r\n"
