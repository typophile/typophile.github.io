body: okay, so if you know what this subject means, you must know that i'm a LOTR
  geek (check the current icon); i found some other information on [[tengwar]] fonts
  on the string about mixing scripts and thought it deserved its very own string.
  so i had a couple questions... first of all has the unicode been standardized for
  the script? secondly, does that really matter now with open type? i mean couldn't
  a person make a tengwar font these days that would just replace the appropriate
  ligature for the vowel placing? (or is ligature substitution what one would want
  to use for tengwar?) i've been interested in making my own tengwar font as the ones
  that are out there don't seem to be as interesting and/or artistic as the could
  be. (or can one of you point me towards some finer fonts?) i'm thinking that New
  Line had to have done SOMETHING for the LOTR series and some of their stuff (like
  the lettering on the ONE RING is absolutely gorgeous!) dunno if they actually made
  a font tho, would be great if they had. anyhow i'm just surprised that the movies
  hadn't sparked more interest in here on this topic! let's get some good dialog flowing...
  i'd love to be enlightened on this one!

  body: thanks eduardo, i had read that string before posting my own. but was just
    wondering if there were any updates since september and seeing if anyone had any
    insight on how best to work out the logistics of a tengwar font. that&#39;s why
    i started this string.

    to encode Tengwar in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2</a> &#40;ISO/EC 10646 is equivalent
    to Unicode&#41;. And here is are his <a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/tengwar.html">

  body: thanks john for the information on unicode.. anyone out there tried to put
    together an open type version of this script? i know there are some people who
    have developed their own applications and fonts for this script &#40;<a href="http://www.acondia.com/tengwar_fonts/index.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.acondia.com/tengwar_fonts/index.html</a>&#41;, but
    wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just make a tengwar font that operated using opentype
    encoding?

    or other to do with lava. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: thanks for the laff, hrant! sauron probably woulda made the opentype version
    if he had ever gotten his ring back. dunno if he had the capabilities to do it
    without it tho.

  body: What, exactly are you looking for in a Tengwar font?  I&#39;ve got in my own
    collection most of the Windows freeware Tengwar fonts out there, &#40;and a couple
    of them I made myself, actually&#41;.  Most of them follow Dan Smith&#39;s &#34;standardized&#34;
    character mapping, but there are also a few that are mapped phonetically.  I have
    also found a number of Roman-readable fonts based on Tengwar letter forms.  E-mail
    me if you have questions.
