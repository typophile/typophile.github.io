body: "An undercomma that is comparable in size to punctuation and to marks that sit
  above the characters often looks huge\u2014at least to me\u2014in a typeface with
  short descenders. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the only person who feels this
  way, as there are some great typefaces where the undercomma is short and gets cut
  off at the descender line. Is either method considered correct in most languages
  that use the undercomma? Is either consider unsightly or in poor taste?"

    of punctuation (commas included) being enlarged against the character sizes to
    cope better with low-resolution imaging. This is a functional consideration \u2013
    otherwise why (as a designer) would you run the risk of having the reader confuse
    a comma for a full point?\r\n\r\nMatthew Carter's Bitstream Charter and Erik Spiekermann's
    FF Meta are specific examples of this, but I'm sure there are others."

  body: The fonts I looked at had them smaller and confined to descender, as you say,
    James. I cheat and make them smaller, about the size of the caron in dcaron and
    tcaron (these two I know from Czech). Does anyone know the proper answer?
