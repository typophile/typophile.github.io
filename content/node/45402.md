  body: "Do you mean the numbers in Font Info -> Font Dimensions -> Subscript and
    Superscript?\r\nThese don't have any relation to the actual glyphs in your font,
    they are merely suggestions for programs that synthesize (i.e. scale and position)
    super- and subscripts. And it's not even guaranteed all programs use these; InDesign,
    for example, uses its own default settings.\r\nThe same goes for underline and
    strikeout thickness and position.\r\n\r\nNote that these numbers are in <em>design</em>
    values; for a typical Type 1 font in 1000ths, for a TTF in 2048ths. Typically,
    they are in percents in any other program (hint towards FL)."

  body: "Yes I do mean the settings in the Font Info > Metrics and Dimensions > Subscript
    and Superscript window.\r\n\r\nI understand they have nothing to do with your
    glyphs and they may not be accessed by a lot of apps, but since they are in the
    font info I was just wondering if anyone has ever deliberately changed the values
    they found there, deleted all the values, or made an effort to put values that
    would be appropriate if they were accessed? Is it safe to ignore this window?
    Is that what most designers do?"
