  Specimen Pool</a> on Flickr. I was pretty impressed by the old specimen books.  But
  I have to ask, where does one find such books? Ebay? Flea markets? Somewhere else?

    them. But there are still chances to find some in well sorted antique book stores.
    Many of them are connected to the Internet. Here are two links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.antiqbook.com/books/speedsearch.php\r\nhttp://www.svaf.se/morris/\r\n\r\nThe
    later one is a great store just outside Stockholm, Sweden. He has a fabulous selection
    of books covering Typography and more. I have found several older type specimen
    there myself. I think there also might be a list of specimen books to look for
    here on Typophile?\r\n\r\nGood luck"

    colleges, universities and art schools there is the fabulous library interloan
    system whereby they'll source it for you if it's not on their shelves. Otherwise,
    it's all about getting lucky in the secondhand bookstores and flea markets. Happy
    hunting."
