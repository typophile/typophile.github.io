  does the little red \"w\" mean in reference to our Wiki? i see the grey \"w\"'s
  and when i click on those links they take me to the Wiki reference, but when i click
  on the links that are red i get a message saying i do not have some sort of privelages
  or right to view the entry? is the entry just not edited yet and it's a dead link?
  or is does it have to do with typophile subrscriptions? \r\n\r\nthanks\r\nw|m\r\n"
