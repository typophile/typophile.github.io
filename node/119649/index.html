  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone

I have just signed up to Typophile, finally, after years of casual browsing and checking in on the forums.

I am working on a logo for my company, 'Bird & Co', the name I use for small freelance jobs outside of my usual day-to-day. I usually team up with specialists such as copywriters etc, hence 'Co'.

My thoughts for the overall branding is to keep things clean and simple, discretely, so that the work speaks for itself. I have been a long admired Caslon IV's Two Line English Egyptian, so used this as a base (and to indulge in personal taste). 

Logo needs to work at small and large sizes, positive and negative

I have developed something I am largely happy with, but know the details are not there yet. I am hoping for input to help make this 'sing'!

Weight, kerning, proportions, letterforms, all up for any / all comments

Thanks very much
Christian

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there,

type looks good – although it might be a little too loose, especially around the "I". But maybe that's just me.

I think the small ampersand lets the brand appear really big. It looks like Bird & Co is a large company and/or institution that has many subsidiaries. If that's what you want, I'd keep the ampersand smaller than the rest of the letters, because it visually separates "Bird" from "Co", by introducing a second font size, which makes it two instead of one, thus provoking the feeling of "many" (at least to me and maybe only very subtle).

I don't know how you want your clients to perceive your business. Maybe you want them to believe you are a big company. Maybe you don't. In the latter case, I suggest you make the ampersand the same size as the other letters to achieve a somewhat uniformed look. Why? I think it communicates integrity. It looks like you are working so closely with your partner specialists that your clients don't even realize there are so many different parties involved.

It really depends on how you want your clients to perceive your business. One more question regarding this: will you be the only one who invoices your client or will your partners send their own invoices?

If you are the only one who handles payment, I suggest you decide whether you want to appear big (small ampersand) or small (normal ampersand).

If your client will receive several invoices, I suggest you clearly separate yourself from your partners by getting rid of "& CO". If you are only invoicing your own services, there's no need to mention other working partners in your company name.

Anyway, it looks good :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">> you decide whether you want to appear big ... or small 

Normally businesses prefer to look big, but you bring up a good point. It's common for designers to be part of a team but I would only use "& Co" unless you have at least one employee besides yourself, or if the other folks are billed through you. 

If the copywriters, photographers, etc have their own businesses and do their own billing, your clients will figure that out pretty quickly anyway. And there's nothing wrong with that, but you don't want clients to feel you're giving a false impression of  your company.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Stefan & James

Thank you very much for replying and for your comments.

I have looked at implementing your suggestions. Completely agree with all points, as you'll see in the quick updates I've been looking at. I've tweaked a number of the letters too.

I feel the ampersand should be a little smaller, to help create some visual contrast with the letterforms, so seems to work well being about the size of the largest counter, it was far too small before - and would impede my ability to use at very small sizes legibly.

Thanks again!

Maybe you can also create an alternative B & C logo for smaler sizes like icons and stuff.</div>
