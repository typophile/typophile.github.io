body: For my thesis i intend to create a typeface library on the web in which users
  can search for fonts &#40;free, commercial, not really sure yet&#41; by entering
  a keyword or creative concept &#40;as well and name, style, designer etc&#41;. <BR>I
  guess it would function like the stock photography sites &#40;imagebank, photonica&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>I believe this is a more effective and more relevant way to search for
  fonts and would remove the need to scroll through screed of alphabetised pages.  This
  process would also be accompanied with a new waay to browse through the search results
  - this is omething i am currently working on. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just gonna put my
  idea out there. <BR>What do guys think?   <BR>Do you reckon a tool like this is
  needed for the type community? <BR>Any feedback would be great!

  body: Some font houses have systems like this on-line, like MyFonts, Linotype FontExplorer,
    and I think Identifont, and probably others too. <BR> <BR>Some people like them,
    others &#40;usually those more expertise with fonts&#41; think they&#39;re a waste.
    I personally think &#34;organic&#34; identification is an interesting field, with
    still unrealized potential. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">AllMusic</a>&#39;s Artist Browser is interesting
    model that might be relevant.  Find a band you like, and scroll down and take
    a look. <BR> <BR>I can imagine something similar with fonts could be pretty valuable.
    Kind of like MyFonts&#39; &#34;More like this&#34; but with a little more direction.

  body: I took a look a Myfonts word database.  it sort of has the seeds of what i
    think i want to create but the keyword list appears quite limited at this stage.
    <BR> <BR>i was considering the idea of having a live database and polling system
    in which people can place their opinion or even add their own words/meaning to
    a particular typeface. Sort of like an miniature ongoing forum for each font.

  body: I think Stephen Coles is/was working on something like this. <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    as for what I can understand from your idea of &#34;organic id&#34;, isn&#39;t
    it a very subtle difference between &#34;organic id&#34; and the &#34;keyword
    id&#34; we see today?

    is open to interpretation - kind of like everything else humans do!  :-&#41; <BR>

  body: I think there&#39;s a basic problem. As soon as you start categorising fonts
    by &#34;creative concept&#34;, you are in effect stereotyping the use of the font.
    Anyone who used such a system as a way of selecting fonts would be stuck with
    cliches, because the system would be &#40;in effect&#41; a giant cliche reproduction
    machine ... which is not what anyone needs. <BR> <BR>You can go only so far with
    reasonably &#34;objective&#34; categories &#40;serif, sans serif, text, display
    etc&#41;. They end up being too large to be really useful. As soon as you start
    trying to sub-divide them into specific &#34;styles&#34; or &#34;uses&#34;, you
    enter the realm of subjective judgement. Nothing wrong with that. But a system
    that tries to allow you to make choices like that by relying on the crutch of
    how others use or see type is not really going to produce &#34;creativity&#34;,
    but bland uniformity. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s tempting to think this would work because
    it works in some other areas &#40;like choosing books or restaurants or whatever&#41;.
    There is some value in those fields to being guided by what other people think.
    But they are about consumption not production. Once &#34;creativity&#34; becomes
    the replication of what is generally accepted it is going to be stale.

  body: Some people like cliches. What one has to look at is the use for the engine.
    If I need to identify a typeface, then cliches are <i>good</i> in that they can
    help me identify a particular font. <BR> <BR>But what about for a new font selection.
    The world of type is immensely large, just like music - it is unlikely that someone
    will listen to every album on earth in the hope of finding new music to listen
    to. <BR> <BR>To beat that similie into a bit more shape, look at Amazon. If I
    have a look for a Crass CD on amazon, I&#39;ll also get peer recommendations for
    other bands - some of these will be close in style, some will be close in politics,
    some will be close merely in that the people who like that band may be more <i>inclined</i>
    to like other completely unrelated bands, but of a similar <i>statue</i>. <BR>
    <BR>Back to a font example - if I did a search for a 30s typeface, in with all
    that chaff of art deco nonsense, I might come across Gill Sans. Further exploration
    could tell em that other people who liked this also liked Perpetua &#40;which
    is a 30s font, but does not necessarily look like the cliche of one, at least,
    not to Joe Bloggs&#41;. Suddenly, because of the use of human beings in all this,
    I have a few items presented to me that may be fitting, but do not extend the
    cliche. <BR> <BR>Just a thought.

  body: i said before that the database would be live. This it seems is they key to
    the sustainability of a tool like this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve imagined it as a place
    where users can have an opinion of the results that come up.  Possibly a polling
    system could be set up for each defntion in realtion to the typeface <BR>it would
    allow for and also generate discussion. <BR> <BR>suggested fonts or &#39;font
    also used&#39; would also make a for a functional feature.
