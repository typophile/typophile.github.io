  \r\nAnyways, here's my problem: I'm a graphic design student, and I find myself
  using Futura Condensed very often. Particularily when I'm going for the clean-modern-elegant
  look. Do you have any suggestions for other fonts that would fit the bill?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nChad

  body: "Chad,\r\n\r\nFutura is a very accommodating typeface for that clean-modern
    look however I find myself using Officina or Frutiger often too. The trick I find
    is to get 2 typefaces that are a nice complement of each other and go from there.
    I know it is bad to limit yourself to 2 and by no means is that what I am saying,
    but for somebody in school it is a very good thing to see what the limitations
    of said face are.\r\n\r\nMy 2 during school were Futura Family (regular & condensed)
    and Minion Pro, a very nice face however used quite often can create the same
    drone feeling that Times has created for itself.\r\n\r\nGood Luck,\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew

    fonts are always harder for me to desern a 'mood' to than serif fonts. Most sans
    look very dull to me. But Frutiger looks nice, and it certainly has a lot of typestyles!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Hve you looked at [[Avenir Next]]</a>? [[Avenir]] is a typeface based on
    [[Futura]] that [[Adrian Frutiger]] designed in 1988. He had never been bappy
    with the cold, modern appearance of Futura, so he humanized it. In 2003, he and
    [[Akira Kobayashi]] redrew Avenir, creating Avenir Next, which has better distribution
    of weight across the family, small caps, old style figures, and condensed styles.
    No [[true italics]], though. I don't think that Frutiger was ever a fan of those.\r\n\r\nHere
    is the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html\">URL to

  body: If you want a more conventional-looking alternative, particularly like Futura's
    small x-height <em>and</em> need a condensed companion as well, Christian Schwartz's
    <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18" target="new">Neutraface</a>
    and <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=94" target="new">Neutraface
    Condensed</a> are the perfect choice. It's got true italics, and can be used both
    in Futura- (Neutraface Alternate) and Avenir (Neutraface "regular")-mode -- two
    type families in one! :-)

  body: "Although I do still like Futura - the regular width, not the condensed -
    my current two favorite sans for a sense of modern elegance are <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=auto&id2=animated&id3=allanimations\"
    target=\"new\">Auto 1</a> from Underware and <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/MagmaOverview.html\"
    target=\"new\">Magma</a> from StoneType.\r\n\r\nMore daring yet still elegant
    are <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_sophisto_ss.html\" target=\"new\">Sophisto</a>
    from MAC Rhino & PSY/OPS, <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_faceplate.html\"
    target=\"new\">Faceplate Sans</a> from PSY/OPS and <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_reykjavik1.html\"
    target=\"new\">Reykjavik One</a> also from PSY/OPS.\r\n\r\nAll these faces are
    fairly narrow, especially Magma and Sophisto.\r\n\r\nchester's stuff, recommended
    by Yves below, is simply incredible. In particular, I reach for <a href=\"http://thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=GalaxiePolaris\"
    target=\"new\">GalaxiePolaris</a> whenever I need a superbly stylish grotesk.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/stalemate.asp\" target=\"new\">Stalemate</a>
    would have been on my list as well if Yves hadn't mentioned it already.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=200\" target=\"new\">Vista Sans</a>
    is wonderful too, but beware. Even though designer Xavier Dupr\xE9 says \"the
    text weights are loosely spaced\" I was shocked to discover just how loosely spaced
    they are - so much so that Vista Sans is not, in my view, a realistic choice for
    extended text at a bookish 9.5 points, for example. Magically, the text weights
    start to work and really are quite lovely starting at around 11 points - but they
    still seem better suited to shorter than to longer texts at this size as well.\r\n\r\nOne
    final caveat on Vista: it is a very, very dark typeface. I usually have issues
    with the fact that many digital fonts are too light for my limited office toolset,
    but Vista is a little dark even for me. The book weight might be considered a
    regular in other fonts, the regular a medium, and the medium a bold.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    I find Dupr\xE9's work amazing and am now saving my pennies for his FF Absara
    Sans, <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001000.php\" target=\"new\">reportedly</a>
    due out from FontShop later this year."
