  admonitions that I just hire a real designer &#40;which I&#39;ll definitely do if
  the results of this contest don&#39;t improve in the next couple of days&#41;, does
  anyone have any suggestions on how I should steer them in my feedback? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    regret for years.  Wise $150 investment.

    you without taking the time to sit down with you to fully understand what you
    are after. <BR> <BR>This, in effect, is why people are telling you to HIRE a graphic
    designer. With that site, you will just get what you pay for. You can&#39;t really
    force better work out of that process. <BR> <BR>The only advice I can suggest
    based on the site you link too would be to not get too caught up with trying to
    get your logo to actually mean anything literally. Your company provides the meaning.
    Your logo simply identifies your company. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Part of the reason what we&#39;re rebranding is that we&#39;re refocusing
    as purely a web development firm.  We had a partner who was quite adept at graphic
    design work, but the relationship didn&#39;t work out, so we&#39;re &#40;with
    good reason I think you&#39;ll agree&#41; getting out of that business.   <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t want to offer any services where we can&#39;t provide professional-level
    work.  Logo design now falls into that category, so we&#39;re no longer offering
    those services. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been disappointed with the results I&#39;ve
    received from the contest thus far, and I agree that this is by no means the most
    noble way of acquiring a decent corporate identity, and that I really should be
    paying a few grand to a real graphic designer to get the work done. &#40;Anyone
    want to loan me some money? j/k&#41; <BR> <BR>So that I&#39;m sufficiently informed
    if/when this first attempt doesn&#39;t work, can anyone recommend how a small
    &#40;micro?&#41; business can get a reasonably good logotype/symbol with a budget
    of just a few hundred dollars?  &#40;I realize that most proper graphic designers
    wouldn&#39;t do it for such a paltry sum, but that unfortunately is all I have
    to work with.&#41; <BR> <BR>To answer Gerald&#39;s question: I&#39;m not trying
    to have you guys make any sort of decision for me. I happened across this site
    a few days ago because I was looking around the web for logo ideas, and since
    I&#39;m interested in typography, thought I&#39;d sign up.  Since I&#39;m currently
    in the middle of a predicament in which I could use some experienced advice about
    typography and branding, I think it&#39;s reasonable that some of my initial posts
    would be about said situation.'

  body: James, there&#39;s a reason you&#39;re not happy with the designs you&#39;re
    getting. Their limitations are inherent in the process.  <BR> <BR>Good design
    requires a lot more background work before anything visual emerges. The designoutpost.com
    method pretty much guarantees the absence of the necessary background work. A
    good doctor wouldn&#39;t diagnose you over the phone -- and a good designer won&#39;t
    come up with a design solution solely over the internet.

  body: Thanks, Meredith. Point well taken. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m
    just going to have to suck it up and go with the best crappy logo I can get on
    the budget, and then hire a designer in a year or so, once I&#39;ve got more of
    a marketing budget in place.

    forum where it might be appropriate to post such a request? <BR> <BR>I know of
    a lot of graphic design forums, but they all seem to be stuck at a pretty amateur
    level.  &#40;Seems like that&#39;s the case with almost any field!&#41; <BR> <BR>

    be picky. In otherwords, find a designer that does work you like and is up to
    your standard. Give them a full brief, let them ask anyquestions, and then let
    them go with it. Accept whatever they come back with. <BR> <BR>If you want to

  body: James most people here want to help and educate and not rip apart another
    person. I hope you are successful. What you might do in the bartering arena, is
    contact design associations not forums and see where it leads. Make sure you have
    something to barter and make it very clear what you are looking for.

  body: I&#39;m far from being naive, especially since I have been a professional
    graphic designer for 25 years, but I&#39;m really stunned that so many designers
    invested so much time and energy for the CHANCE at so little in compensation.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m no longer surprised when businesses &#40;of any size&#41; opt
    to put so little investment into the primary branding or identity element on which
    they rely for the promotion and customer recognition of their business venture
    in the marketplace.  After all, in the 1970&#39;s Nike did originally pay only
    $35 for their logo - which Phil Knight accepted with some reluctance due to a
    looming print deadline.  At least the company made it up to the designer years
    later with the gift of a good sum of stock and a day in her honor. <BR> <BR>At
    the end of his career designer Paul Rand would take on one identity project a
    year for the fee of $100,000.  I think that&#39;s a great fee goal for any designer
    - instead of bidding to see just how inexpensively &#40;i.e. cheaply&#41; one
    can produce such a project.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher <BR>Engineer of Creative
