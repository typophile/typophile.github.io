		<div class="commentbody">My interest in this issue has recently been rekindled, so I'd like to followup with some questions.

1) The link above is to Thomas Phinney's suggestion that glyph names are important for glyph-to-Unicode mapping in certain PDF work flows. I have heard elsewhere that extracting text from PDF using glyph-to-Unicode mapping isn't all that reliable anyway -- especially for complex scripts. Can anyone comment on the reliability and accuracy of this mechanism?

2) Other than the above-mentioned PDF issue, are there any reasons that ttf-flavored OpenType fonts need glyph names at all? Said another way, what would break if all my fonts had format-3 post tables?

According to the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm|post table spec]] regarding format 3:
<blockquote>
The printing behavior of this version on PostScript printers is unspecified, except that it should not result in a fatal or unrecoverable error. Some drivers may print nothing, other drivers may attempt to print using a default naming scheme.
</blockquote>
which seems to suggest there can be printing problems. But then  [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm|Microsoft's recommendations]] later state:
<blockquote>
OpenType fonts containing CFF outlines use only format 3.0 of the 'post' table.
</blockquote>
so I'm getting mixed messages here.

Why the question? The growing use of webfonts makes font size an issue again, and thus omitting glyph names can improve performance.

Thanks for any help.

PS: I know that glyph names are useful during development, e.g., for writing OT and Graphite feature code. My question relates to the final product, not the development process.</div>

AFAIK it is good as long as no one to many substitutions or glyph reordering are involved. Also there should be strict one to one or many to one maapings between input characters and glyphs, e.g. if you have both <code>smcp</code> and <code>c2sc</code> features, there must be two smallcap glyph sets, one a.sc, …, z.sc and one A.sc, …, Z.sc respictively.

<cite>Said another way, what would break if all my fonts had format-3 post tables?</cite>
PDF creators should build a non-version 3 post table when embedded such fonts in PDF files (some do), but if they don’t printing can break.

CFF table contains glyph names, so there is no need for them in the post table.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, Khaled. Questions of clarification below:

By "one to many substitutions", are you referring to GSUB lookups of type 2 ("multiple") or something else?

<em>... or glyph reordering are involved.</em> 

Does this includes character-level reordering as in what the Indic shapers for OpenType do?

Ah, that explains that part of the mystery. Thanks again.

Yes. Generally you can reverse map a single glyph to a single or multiple characters, but you can’t reverse map multiple glyphs to a single character. The exact algorithm used is described in [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html#2|Adobe Glyph Naming convention]].

<cite>Does this includes character-level reordering as in what the Indic shapers for OpenType do?</cite>

Since the output of the reverse mapping will be in the order of the glyphs, any recording that affects the final glyph order will a;so affect the reverse mapping (except for RTL swapping, though some applications fail with that too and return reverse mapped text in the visual not the logical order).</div>

Right. It is tempting to think that it might be possible to reverse reordering once one has the character identities of the glyph string, but in practice this fails in a number of ways, influenced by how the font has been built. It isn't unusual for post-reordering GSUB features to produce ligatures of glyphs that represent characters that are not sequential in the pre-reordered string. Adobe's glyph naming conventions do not cater for this.

I think it would be possible to define glyph name conventions and rules for making Indic fonts that would make it possible to cleanly reverse reordering from parsed character strings, but I doubt if that would get much traction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This thread has been very helpful -- thanks for the input.  One last (I hope) question:

Other than the PDF text extraction previously discussed, what will break if the glyphs have names that are well-formed but are not names that are included in the [[http://sourceforge.net/adobe/aglfn/wiki/AGL%20Specification/|Adobe Glyph List Specification]]?

I am acquainted with AGL and AGLFN, and our policy is to conform to AGLFN when the font is shipped. (During development we may use non-AGL names, but those are replaced prior to shipping). But I am having an ongoing discussion with someone who dislikes the Adobe names and chooses to ignore the AGL conventions.  Is there any risk to his behaviour?</div>

As for problems today, the main one remains the classic: if a PostScript print stream or file is created, and then turned into PDF without the original font available, then glyph names are the only means to get the encoding from the print stream. If the font uses unrecognized glyph names, then the text in the resulting PDF will not be searchable, copyable, etcetera.</div>
