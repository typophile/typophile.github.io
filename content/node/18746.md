    for constraints-based concrete poetry where part of the effect of the poem is
    the visual shape it makes. Shaped verse, depending on a monowidth font. Now, whatever
    the merits of that idea, I approached the task of designing a monowidth typeface
    for it strictly on the premise of improving text colour, because monowidth fonts
    produce very lumpy colour. It occurred to me that combining monowidth with the
    Alphabet 26 unicase scheme would be one way to do that.\r\n\r\nIt's not a question
    of unicase looking \"wacky\", but a question of how it's used. Sure, an unusual
    font will look wacky if it's dropped into a generic tombstone layout. But the
    point of creative typographic design, going beyond easy rote cliches, is to create
    a concept and execution (layout, typography, illustration, etc.) where everything
    works together as a seamless, synergistic whole, and no component stands out above
    the overall message. So, find the layout that fits the face, or vice versa. "
