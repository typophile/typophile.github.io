  body: ' These are great, Tom. Where are you finding them? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s strange
    how many sports teams use Tuscan lettering. Our local New York Mets feature Tuscans
    in both their &#39;NY&#39; monogram and the words &#39;NEW YORK&#39; spelled out
    on their jerseys &#40;or at least on the tie-in merchandise they license...&#41;
    At least one of the &#39;Sox&#39; teams uses a Tuscan as well, though I&#39;ve
    forgotten which, and I&#39;d hate to make a clay-footed blunder by guessing. &#40;The
    only topic more contentious than font piracy is sports.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    collecting Tuscans for a project, so if you come across any others, I&#39;d love
    to see them. '

  body: ' So it&#39;s called Tuscan, huh? This particular typeface is from a Rawlings
    catalog and is called &#34;Fancy&#34;. &#40;See also &#34;Pittsburgh Pirates Typeface&#34;
    posting.&#41; I just now found a very similar one on the MyFonts website called
    &#34;URW Wood Type D&#34;.  <BR> <BR>And I made a mistake on the team myself.
    It&#39;s the Pittsburg Pirates that use a similar typeface and not the SF Giants.
    I reversed the two names. Oops. '

  body: ' Tuscan&#39;s not the name of the typeface, it&#39;s the general species.
    &#34;Tuscan&#34; letterforms are those that have bifurcated &#40;fishtail&#41;
    serifs, and more often than not, some sort of ornamentation midway along the stems.
    For obvious reasons, the phototype crowd used to refer to this style as &#34;pineapple
    type.&#34; <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s got a couple of Tuscans in their various Wood
    Type collections. And if you look very carefully at the banner at www.typography.com,
    you&#39;ll see some Tuscans lurking in the background. Another project to come...
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to get that Rawlings catalog. Could I trouble you for some
    more information about it? &#40;Name, date, etc.&#41; '

    fonts are from the 1999 Men&#39;s or Women&#39;s Basketball Rawlings Catalogs.
    They didn&#39;t have much more information than that. I&#39;ve looked on their
    website but can&#39;t find anything about the typefaces. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your
    help and my congrats to &#39;Brother&#39; Jones on the Retina face. Truly Divine. '

    &#34;Nineteenth Century Ornamented Types and Title Pages,&#34; and Rob Roy Kelly&#39;s
    &#34;American Wood Type: 1828-1900.&#34; They&#39;re both annoyingly out of print,
    but a good library should have them. They&#39;re both chocked full of Tuscans. '
