  identity systems? Recently, I've completed designing my personal mark and I want
  to start building a story around it. I want to make my brand, as a designer, unique
  to me as an individual, as well as get clients excited about what I do, is what
  I'm looking to get out of this project.\r\n\r\nThere are some stellar examples of
  identity systems on Behance, of course, but I'd like some suggestions/precautions
  before I jump in head first."

    take any and all advice at this point.\r\n\r\nI want to avoid e-mailing random
    artists I find on Behance because I'd rather get a discussion going with a community
    of designers."
