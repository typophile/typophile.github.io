body: "I've recently started doing design work for financial advisors, on top of the
  ninetofive at a commercial signage shop/digital printer's. I've done logo design
  at the day job in the past, but obviously the clientele there (mostly of the Mom
  & Pop's Fish & Chips variety) isn't half as concerned with protecting their marks
  as the financial advisors.\r\n\r\nI was wondering how to approach placing Trademark
  and Registered Trademark symbols tastefully on logos. Do I want them to 'nest' with
  the letterforms and blend in, or seperate them and leave them hovering like an insect?
  What about the size relationship? Naturally a logo must be printed at different
  sizes, does the trademark remain a constant size or should it resize too?\r\n\r\nInsight
  appreciated."

  body: I say make it as small as possible for it to still be legible. Unobtrusive
    is the key.

  body: "What's nice though is a logo that can optionally sort of nestle the mark
    within it so it doesn't stick out when it's included, but of course still look
    fine when it's not there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "There is really no rule. As a rule of thumb, the TM* should be as non obtrusive
    as possible. Our firm will occasionally develop several different optical variants
    of a mark, intended for different size applications. A feature of these variants
    normally incorporates different sizes of the TM or (R) to match the intended reproduction
    size of the mark. \r\n\r\nGo with a placement that works with the mark. Normally
    it follows the mark, and is most commonly located at the top (although recent
    trends have seen this changing).\r\n\r\n*I am assuming you will mostly be working
    with a TM, not a registered mark.\r\n"

    in the U.S. a trademark \xAE or TM only has to appear once at the beginning of
    a document although I just read an article about SPAM\xAE vs spam, where every
    time SPAM\xAE was mentioned they had it in all caps and \xAE. "

  body: "Also please note that the \xAE symbol can <strong>only</strong> be used if
    the logotype has in fact been registered with the U.S. Patent Office. The TM,
    on the other hand, does not require registration but offers only common-law protection
    to the mark."

  body: "To illustrate my previous comment of logotypes for various size applications,
    see the following link. You will notice that the (R) is sized accordingly to its
    size application. Also we have less detail in things such as the wheat for smaller
    applications.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.brandsbyovo.com/downloads/SnydersofHanovercmyk.pdf\r\n"

    thing.
