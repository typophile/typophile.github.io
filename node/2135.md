  body: ' Albert-Jan Pool gave me the following answer. &#40;For your information,
    my employer is presently writing a book called &#39;Wayshowing&#39; on the subject
    of signage, signage typography etc. This was the reason for my questions in the
    first place&#41;. <BR> <BR>QUOTE <BR>thanks for your interest in the DIN subject.
    1995 Erik Spiekermann asked me <BR>if I would be interested in doing a redesign
    of DIN Mittelschrift, and have <BR>it released by FontShop. We thought it a good
    idea to create a family of at <BR>least 3 or fou weights. I came up with five,
    the medium resembles FF DIN <BR>Mittelschrift in weight. The regular is suited
    for longer reading text. DIN <BR>Mittelschrift is far too heavy for text. I started
    designwork by creating <BR>the light and the black version, and took care that
    the medium, which was to <BR>be generated by interpolation would be close to the
    original DIN <BR>Mittelschrift. Most of this, and a lot more interesting stuff
    can be found <BR>in the broschure &raquo;FontFontFocus FF DIN&laquo; available
    through FontShop. <BR>You can also find some details on their website. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately
    I do not know who ever designed the original DIN. I made <BR>several attempts,
    without any result. <BR> <BR>DIN was originally designed for signage. Most likely
    in the early thirties. <BR>Most countries tried to establish industry-standards
    by that time. The <BR>Germans were pretty much ahead by that time, probably because
    the fascists <BR>were already thinking of streamlining everything for mass-production
    of <BR>anything needed for the war that was planned. The idea was that most sign
    <BR>makers would construct the characters by ruler and compass, and scale the
    <BR>measurements from a grid. This was thought to be easy. Unfortunately this
    <BR>theory ignores that most signmakers are quite good at drawing by hand. This
    <BR>is one of the ideas behind FF DIN. It combines strict rules with <BR>craftmanship
    and provides letterforms which are a bit more fluent than DIN. <BR>FF DIN also
    has a bit more contrast in stroke weight, the horizontal strokes <BR>are thinner
    than the vertical ones. Therefore it is a bit more readable than <BR>DIN Mittelschrift.
    <BR> <BR>When you write a book about signage it would be interesting to contact
    <BR>Gerard Unger. He knows a lot about it because he designed a typeface for the
    <BR>Dutch traffic signs. <BR>Also interesting: <BR>http//:www.urwpp.de <BR>URW
    has digitized a fair number of traffic types. They did the previous <BR>dutch
    version &#40;a derivate of the american one&#41;, also the spanish, the <BR>danish,
    the french, and I believe also the english and the austrian ones. <BR>They also
    digitized the original version of the american &#34;highway gothic&#34;, <BR>which
    is not Interstate. Interstate is a redesign. Some of them maybe not <BR>available
    as postscript fonts because the character sets do not have <BR>accents, currency
    symbols an so on. They were sold to Signus customers, a <BR>former signage software
    package with an Ikarus-based proprietary fint <BR>format. Signus used to be very
    popular because of its extreme accuracy. <BR>Unfortunately the Windows version
    never really made it. But maybe they would <BR>like to convert the missing ones
    when you mention them as a source in the <BR>book. <BR>UNQUOTE '
