  body: ' Christian - pretty cool. As something to shoot for, Cabarga Cursiva is a
    masterwork. You can unlock a lot of script secrets by looking at that face. This
    is wholly different and very appealing. You got the thicks/thins down. The face
    has got great upside. Uppercase would seem to have more improvisational opportunities
    and this is where the face could really fly. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: Thanks, bj. I&#39;m looking forward to doing the upper case...  <BR> <BR>Here
    is the scribble that started me on this face. The thing <BR> that struck me was
    the jerky, boxy quality &#40;notice the  <BR>ascender&#41;. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1834.gif"

  body: ' I have seen it, though I didn&#39;t reference it  <BR>for this face. It
    has some incredible vitality. <BR> <BR>With this face I&#39;ve tried to interpret
    the shapes <BR>geometrically, yet retain the vitality of hand <BR>writing. For
    now, the lower case feels a little <BR>bland to me. I&#39;m hoping some spice
    in the caps <BR>will liven it up. Any ideas for spice in the <BR>lower case? <BR>

  body: ' I love this face... I see the comparison to Epaulet but find that this face
    has less <BR>sense of humor, I really like that about the face, it is hard to
    stick into any particular category. It is commercial enough to get used in real
    work but esoteric enough to be passed off as &#34;too weird&#34; by most main
    stream/agency designers. As for Display scripts this is sterile for something
    that at first sight seem to fit into  the stylized fun category, as compared to,
    for instance, Phil Grimshaws&#39; designs that are full of life expressed by calligraphic
    movements and nuances that  usually ended up in the ITC collection. This restain
    and sterility, is exactly what I look for when selecting type.A really nice piece
    of work. I would encourage you to open dialogue with  Peter Bruhn/Fountain to
    discuss distribution when you finish it. '

  body: ' This is BRILLIANT. -- I have to agree with Stephen -- Christian, you ARE
    a tease! <BR> <BR>Maybe it makes me weird, but I loved the idea behind MM fonts
    and wish this one were available in that format. My wish would be to have control
    of the contrast.  <BR> <BR>The comparisons to Cabarga and Epaulet -- I understand,
    and maybe there are some things similar, but perhaps it is like comparing apples
    and oranges. Or for you music lovers a better analogy might be the trumpet playing
    Miles Davis to that of Chet Baker. While Chet&#39;s execution and technique are
    flawless, Miles&#39; phrasing and direction is always more interesting. '
