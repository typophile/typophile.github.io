  and I was wanting to know if any of you knew of any type history museums there?
  This may sound stupid, but I couldn't find a lot via Google... I'm probably just
  not looking for the right thing. Any typographic wonders, specific graffiti hot-spots
  or just places that you could recommend are welcome as well. Thanks."

    know already: you can search typophile.com (via Google) with this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12436\">bookmarklet/favelet</a>,
