body: "Both Word and PowerPoint 2008 for Mac are displaying some Postscript fonts
  incorrectly.  There are 3 different menus which list fonts in Word 2008, and the
  fonts in question are sometimes missing certain styles in one menu, and missing
  others in a different menu.  We are most concerned about a Bitstream font called
  Geometric 415.  I have tried to tweak the font menu names in TransType Pro, with
  some success, but cannot get the problem to completely go away.  I have contacted
  Microsoft, Bitstream, and the place we bought the fonts from, but with no luck yet.\r\n\r\nAny
  Ideas would be most appreciated."
