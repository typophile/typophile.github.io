  set. I haven't had any luck searching with Google, within FontShop or within MyFonts.
  \r\n\r\nI know that Adobe Garamond Premier Pro, Baskerville 10 Pro, Minion Pro,
  and Fedra have them (because I tested them on my computer). \r\n\r\nSeems there
  should be a list out there somewhere . . . perhaps on this site?\r\n\r\nBonus question:
  will the Cyrillic set serve for setting Macedonian? I am setting a book of poetry
  with Macedonian/English en face.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: "Dear Maxim,\r\n\r\nThanks for teaching me a thing or two about searching
    at MyFonts.com. \r\nOddly, specifying the foundry as Adobe, or Monotype yielded
    no results. Search engines can be so disappointing.\r\n\r\nI took a detour and
    learned about ParaType, then viewed their catalog. That yielded some interesting
    possibilities.\r\n\r\nValerie\r\nScribe Typography\r\n\r\n\r\n"
