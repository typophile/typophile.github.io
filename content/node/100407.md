    and have the font used all over the shop.. or keep  schtum ;).\r\n\r\nIt is a
    font, with a special character... but I kinda like that it's unique at the moment
    - so may keep it under my hat.. bribes accepted though ;-)\r\n\r\nIf anyone gets
    it.. I'll send you a bag of Coffee .. \r\n\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n"
