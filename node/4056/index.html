Fortunately in the past two months I've developed an armada of reasons (based on linguistics, reading theory, as well as the work of Dwiggins and others), and one day I will write a full article to put the regressive hand-mongers in their place. Real quick: chirographic type is dysfunctional because: it promotes excessive, literal, superficial modularity; misuses the cartesian space (differently in each dimension); and creates a detrimental relationship between the two edges of the letterform body (in opposite to Notan, the core principle of design).

And serifs most certainly improve readability. So if you're setting a book not intended for idealistic Bauhaus-infected designers, use a serif face. If it helps, use one of the recent &quot;honest&quot; Latin-slab faces, like FF Zine, Parkinson's Azusa, Patria (not released yet), etc. <BR> <BR>Italic? A necessary evil.

		<div class="commentbody">Ikarus never used Bezier curves. It used what are called Hermite splines: essentially concatenated circular arcs with on-curve control handles. There are <A HREF="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Spline.html" TARGET="_top">many different kinds of spline curves.</A> <BR> <BR>FontLab's sketch mode doesn't use genuine Hermite splines. It uses some other kind of spline to approximate their behavior. The difference is subtle but noticeable. A side effect is that you cannot import Ikarus IK data into FontLab. You can download the latest FontLab demo for Mac <A HREF="http://www.fontlab.ch/downloads/FL45MacDemo.hqx" TARGET="_top">here</A> or get the Windows version <A HREF="http://www.fontlab.ch/downloads/FL4WinDemo.exe" TARGET="_top">here</A>.  <BR> <BR>To use actual Hermite splines, you need Ikarus or its successor: what used to be called Ikarus is now reincarnated as DTL IkarusMaster, part of their <A HREF="http://www.fontmaster.nl" TARGET="_top">FontMaster</A> package. You can also download Mac or PC <A HREF="http://www.fontmaster.nl/DemoDownloads.html" TARGET="_top">demo versions</A> of it as well. Be aware that whereas the full FontLab package will run you about $600 (or $550 without the printed manual), FontMaster is upwards of $2000. I spent some time evaluating FM, and so far I think FontLab is the better choice. I would encourage you to first play with its Sketch mode and see if that gives you back the control that you have missed. <BR> <BR> I recommend FontMaster <I>only</I> if you have a lot of IK data sitting around, or if you prefer its audit or blend routines to FL. <BR> <BR>I am still searching for tools that aren't tied down to the outline paradigm. Stroke-based font development offers so many advantages for certain kinds of lettering, especially when it comes to multiple weights. The only packages that implement it thoroughly are the unfortunately non-GUI Metafont and some <A HREF="http://www.fontworks.com/product_gaiji.html" TARGET="_top">rather specialized Japanese packages</A>. <BR> <BR>In addition to implementing the pen metaphor (dare I say &quot;moving front&quot;) there is also the punchcutting metaphor. While several digital fonts have made use of punchcutting traditions in guiding their development, I wonder how a modern digital tool might more accurately model those practices, or if doing so would be of any use to a currently practicing type designer.</div>

It means slab serifs that are angled, or Latin serifs that are sheared, depending on how you look at it. Like this: <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/azuza/medium/windows-postscript/84084/character/006B/CP2/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/azuza/medium/windows-postscript/84084/character/006B/CP2/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/azuza/medium/windows-postscript/84084/character/006B/CP2/</a></A> <BR> <BR>To me such serifs tend to avoid the mechanical feel of slabs as well as the haughtiness of Latins, conveying a certain austerity, which translates to honesty. <BR> <BR>&gt; serifs improve readability, but only if that's what you're used to reading <BR> <BR>No way, dude. Don't believe the hype. <BR> <BR>Familiarity is only half the story (and it's not even properly understood).

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, please understand that I'm talking in terms of design <I>tools</I> and not in terms of design itself.  <BR> <BR>The &quot;moving front&quot; idea is an accurate, solid model for representing most Latin lettering before type arrived. When type appeared, lettershapes started to reflect the physical limitations and artifacts of punchcutting, which in turn became integral to later designs. These serifed designs became the order of the day throughout the Latin-script world by the mid-20th century, and people became accustomed to them and grew to prefer them.  <BR> <BR>They read them best, and they read them most, one might say. :-) <BR> <BR>Still, there are plenty of recent designs that are based more directly on calligraphy than on later oldstyle and transitional type. Palatino comes to mind, and it just happens to be the most pirated face in the world. Between 1978 and 1996, students of Gerrit Noordzij (the person Hrant has lately fallen into a pattern of aspiring to disagree with&hellip; who proposed the moving front model) output over 120 designs, most of whch are being sold commercially. The list of students includes just about every Dutch type designer who's done business in the past twenty years or so. And they're not all tied to this front metaphor either: his students are independent thinkers in their own right, which I would think was his goal all along. <BR> <BR>Even not-so-purely-calligraphic type designs ultimately derive from writing as well, and in most cases broad-nib-pen writing. But I also asked about other kinds of tools, particularly based on punchcutting metaphors. (Because I just happened to have recently finished <I>Counterpunch</I> which has been the most enthralling book I've read in years.)  <BR> <BR>You can use more than one tool, Hrant. It's OK. You're allowed. :-) And please also understand that I'm not interested in modeling simple, unmodulated pen strokes. That's been done and is only useful up to a point, and certainly not adequate for most type design.  <BR> <BR>More complexity can be automated. The fact that no one has yet done so doesn't negate the possibility, and such tools are the kinds I am interested in. Two graphics packages, namely Microsoft Visio and Creature House Expression formerly from Fractal Design, offer object models (but as yet no built-in primitives) for a more powerful kind of stroke-based vector drawing. Expression is more readily suited to this than Visio, but Visio could be put to similar use with some custom shape programming. You can make a shape scale uniformly in Visio, but you can also make it behave more complexly, e.g. stretching a line of icons to add more icons, or changing its width resulting in the icons scaling uniformly and possibly reducing in number. <BR> <BR>The next time I talk about this, it will be with pictures, and not on someone else's time. (Apologies to Julien.) <BR> <BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <BR>[Jared, please let me use hr tags on typophile!] <BR> <BR>Back to Ikarus: Julien, I would be curious to hear <I>your</I> opinions as an Ikarus user regarding how well FontLab's sketch mode suits your needs. I'm not accustomed to drawing in Ikarus, but I can say that I have occasionally used the Sketch mode to make fine outline adjustments to letters I found for whatever reason unsatisfying, and I really enjoyed using it. It was much easier to adjust curves with it. I still prefer Beziers for corners and tangents, and I'm still not keen on the idea of converting from one kind of outline to another while still in the design phase.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I'm talking in terms of design tools and not in terms of design itself. <BR> <BR>But the tools strongly guide the results (as much as that hurts our control-drunk egos). The moving front is indeed good for understanding the lettering of the past, it's in fact also good for understanding much actual type (although in the same way that a breathalizer is good for understanding why that car crashed happened&hellip; :-). As you said, there are very many GN disciples who have made a living making chirographic (hand-based) type. It's funny that some of them actually ridicule Zapf (didn't want to mention that, eh? :-) even though he's 10 times more successful than them. How did that happen? Well, 50,000 Frenchman *can* be wrong. GN has great charisma, and students are typically ripe for being influenced - free thinkers are rare. When William Morris complained about all the misguided commercial products around him, most people didn't get it either. Chirographic type is an impediment to cultural progress. It limits exploration to the continent we're already on. We need an astrolabe to *really* explore, and that astrolabe -conveniently ignored by the GN clan- is an understanding of *reading*, not writing. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>I thought you were implying that there should be font design software that lets you define fonts based on strokes, coupled to translation and rotation of the front. Well, ideologically that would violate notan (the unity and relationship between black and white - the heart of design). Practically, it would violate human perception: just look at all those masterful text fonts that people who [would] disagree with GN (I'm not the only one, not by a long shot - although I'm also not masterful&hellip;) have produced. Design through outlines is not an engineer's distortion of the craft: it is in fact the true way. Chirographic type is selfish artistry, it is anti-craft. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; over 120 designs <BR> <BR>BTW, I'm not doubting it, but I wondering where you got that number - &quot;Haagse Letters&quot;? (I'm actually waiting for my copy of that compendium.) <BR> <BR>&gt; his students are independent thinkers in their own right <BR> <BR>Strike up a functionalist argument with one of them, and you might realize how similar they all are; chances are they'll revert to the familiarity escape clause (the way you're doing?). Familiarity is only half the story (and it's not even understood*) - face it, and move forward. Independent? Or maybe uncommitted to considering the relevance of *reading* and/or the limits of their artistry. There is so much potential in those designers - I hope one day they will start thinking fearlessly, and realize there's so much more to type than expression. GN himself can at least take credit for thinking laterally, against his environment. His students (as a whole) seem entirely conventional to me. Which makes sense considering how dogmatically GN actually expresses himself - never a trace a self-doubt - never questions, only answers. <BR> <BR>* Does familiarity concern individual letters, or boumas? Does it concern letters as structures, or as holistic shapes? How quickly is familiarity gained, for what types of things? All of these central questions are never even *asked* by those who worship at its altar. Makes sense, I guess: religion cannot really handle inquisition. Art exists for its own sake. But type is less than half art. <BR> <BR>&gt; Counterpunch &hellip; the most enthralling book I've read in years. <BR> <BR>&quot;Counterpunch&quot; is indeed amazing. Strangely enough, it's the book that launched my alphabet reform effort, when I realized that the lc &quot;a&quot; in the Latin alphabet is facing the wrong way&hellip; Although I later realized that glyph direction is irrelevant during immersive reading. You can see the whole messy development of this most uncomfortable idea of mine in the archives of Typo-L. If you're interested, start here <A HREF="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9805&amp;L=typo-l&amp;P=R2118&amp;I=-3" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9805&amp;amp;L=typo-l&amp;amp;P=R2118&amp;amp;I=-3">http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9805&amp;amp;L=typo-l&amp;amp;P=R2118&amp;amp;I=-3</a></A> , but be prepared to read through a couple of years&hellip; Anyway, what's interesting about Smeijers is how deeply he contradicts himself sometimes: the mark of an artist. And I do admire Quadraat, if for other reasons than Smeijers claims to have intended. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>BTW, I don't think I'm/we_are hijacking Julien's thread: his essential complaint was concerning non-chirographic type. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
