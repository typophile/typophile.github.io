  body: "Chances are that this is custom, but I think Tomas Brousil's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/teimer/|Teimer]]
    is fairly close. The 'a' shape is very similar, the serifs are similarly flat.
    The main differences I see are the 'T' which is taller in the logo, as are the
    other ascenders, I think. The type in the logo is slightly more condensed that
    the Teimer Standard face, making me wonder if there is a Teimer Display version.\r\n\r\nI
    am still looking for a closer match.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    Walbaum Standard]]. I was about to say the previous choice was my best alternative,
    but I think this Walbaum matches very well. The ligatures in the logo are probably
    customized, but the typeface is surely some version of Walbaum, if not the Berthold
    one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
