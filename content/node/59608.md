  drinkers, it turns out, are as passionate about packaging as they are about pulp.
  That's why they rebelled when parent company PepsiCo and consultancy Arnell overhauled
  the juice line's packaging in January as part of a $35 million branding campaign
  called \"Squeeze.\" \r\n\r\nTropicana fans said the simplicity of the new design
  reminded them of store-brand generics. And who wants to be mistaken for a generic
  consumer? \r\n\r\nWithin a month, the public's flogging by e-mail, phone, and blogs
  forced PepsiCo to bring back the old straw-in-an-orange cartons. Other parts of
  the campaign remain, but PepsiCo will probably think twice before it tries updating
  this icon again.<<\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure I agree. While I understand
  the connection between the sparser design looking more like generic products, I
  think generic products are becoming the freeway for cleaner design. Also, if it
  harkens a generic counterpart, wouldn't you prefer feeling like you've purchased
  the cheaper product?\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.avoision.com/portnoy/images/2009/february/redlineAds_3.jpg\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tropicana_6548.jpg]</a>"
