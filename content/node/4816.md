  body: Gerald <BR> <BR>Thanks for info on light trapping. Guess I should take a good
    look at some of those old photofilm/offset manuals I&#39;ve got laying around.
    This is of some concern, but probably only to me, so thanks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    agree with you that the hand punchcutter would not have been concerned with optical
    scaling as it would have been a natural organic process to them. As it is for
    a calligrapher. Calligraphers don&#39;t change to a fatter brush or pen when they
    are working with different sizes of letterforms. These restrictions have been
    forced on us by the mechanical.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes, perhaps, it is best to look
    at the origins and rationalize forward from there, rather than backward from here.
    The virtual, and the mechanical, have a naughty tendency to cloud the way. <BR>

    I discovered it was a reworked Beatty font &#40;by Beatty for UC&#41;, and more
    interesting, the text note indicates that he worked on it in 1996, with additionals
    in 2000. Someone had asked me what ever happened to him, as my last contact was
    1996 or so. Apparently he is still out and about. <BR> <BR>Gerald <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Addison. <BR> <BR><i>Tell me this, Mr. Giampa. Frederic Goudy cut his own
    type, right? Did he anticipate the finer execution of printing that you expect?
    In other words, do you feel your digital versions of his types live up to his
    &#40;Goudy&#39;s&#41; expectations of his metal types? And please, this is no
    attack--I just want to know your opinion.</i> <BR> <BR>&#40;1.&#41; The patterns
    were very lightly inked, proofs were pulled on a Vandercook #4. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaProofPress.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/GiampaProofPress.html</a> <BR> <BR>&#40;2.&#41;
    The inked proofs were hand digitized on a very high resolution tablet. The software
    is Ikarus, 15,000 units vs Fontographer 1000 units. <BR> <BR>&#40;3.&#41; The
    digitized outlines were laser output on onion skin paper at <i>&#34;exact&#34;
    same size</i> as the inked proofs. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/PatternIkarus.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/PatternIkarus.html</a> <BR> <BR>&#40;4.&#41;
    Laser output positioned over the inked proofs would illustrate clearly the minutest
    deviance allowing for easy perfection. <BR> <BR>If Goudy was happy with his own
    lead master patterns certainly he would be equally happy with the <i>digital mastering.</i>
    <BR> <BR>As objects he may prefer lead to polymer, I know I  do. <BR> <BR>As far
    as his opinion of desktop publishing goes I can not speak to that matter. <BR>
    <BR>Gerald Lange has spoken of Goudy&#39;s welcoming Photocomp with open arms.
    I wonder how happy he really was &#34;without&#34; drawn small caps, ligatures
    and tied characters. <BR> <BR>I suspect he was greatly  disappointed. <BR> <BR>Would
    Goudy be happy with digital type? Well, if he liked Photocomp I see no reason
    he would not like digital type. I don&#39;t, but that&#39;s just me. <BR> <BR>I
    believe Goudy would have continued drawing letterforms with pen and paper. He
    would prefer, I predict, Ikarus over Fontographer or FontLab for outlining. <BR>
    <BR>I know I do, I know Jim does. Ikarus is the finest method for digitizing paper
    artwork. Not so for originating typefaces. Ikarus is not a drawing tool. <BR>

  body: Gerald G. <BR> <BR>Probably not a good idea to hold hands with the dead -
    they may not appreciate it. An old saying. I suspect though that Goudy&#39;s interest
    in designing was at the forefront over other concerns he had and most likely he
    would have gladly participated in the digital world. Especially so because of
    the residuals!!! <BR> <BR>Thanks for the step by step on how you digitized the
    patterns. There were some Monotype patterns up on eBay a while back &#40;Felicity&#41;.
    $360, no reserve, and they went unsold. Hard to believe. By the way, don&#39;t
    give away those Californians. You asked me a while back about an institutional
    home. I believe I now have found one. This will have to be offlist. <BR> <BR>I
    gave up completely on metal about five or six years ago. Partly I was quite enthused
    about the direction of digital type, of which you were an inspirational factor,
    and partly I found the process eliminated a lot of the restrictions imposed by
    metal type technology. Not a bad thing to have learned those restrictions mind
    you. But, more importantly, had I not fully gone over to photopolymer, I would
    be plumb out of business. You more than most, would understand the problems that
    maintaining a shop of metal type related technology imposes in this regard.  <BR>
    <BR>Yes, photopolymer as a type form does not have the je ne sais quoi of metal,
    but my concern has always been the printed page rather than idle homage to technology.

    <BR> <BR>Nope - sorry. <BR> <BR>And your elaboration makes it clear that you&#39;re
    thinking like an artist, focusing on the act of creation instead of the necessities
    of usage. I never said calligraphy is <i>easier</i> than type design - that&#39;s
    moot. I&#39;m looking at it from the viewpoint of the user/reader, who could care
    less what tools you enjoy fondling and what your childhood was like. <BR> <BR>In
    calligraphy, the lack of variance in stroke thickness with respect to size is
    a problem when it comes to optimal letterform quality. Because type design is
    non-instantaneous, it allows for the considered, conscious control of things like
    weight &#40;and its ideal distribution&#41;. This should be obvious. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the answers, in the end. <BR>I&#39;ll wait for news on the
    optical scaling software, etc. Thanks. <BR> <BR>&#62; You may need better glasses.
    <BR> <BR>I have 20/15 vision. <BR> <BR>&#62; not until you and I determine the
    best way to go with optical scaling. <BR> <BR>I thought I didn&#39;t know anything?
    <BR> <BR>But lacking a fancy method to streamline the selection of optically-correct
    fonts from a typeface family, providing separate fonts isn&#39;t so bad - remember
    that optical scaling is a specialist thing, and specialists are usually willing
    to make the extra effort. <BR> <BR>&#62; Lanston&#39;s Californian is the most
    authentic vesion of Goudy&#39;s Californian. <BR> <BR>At one point size. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; photopolymer as a type form does not have the je ne sais quoi of metal
    <BR> <BR>I found metal type a lot of fun, but: <BR>1&#41; Mostly just to fondle;
    actually setting metal type is pretty pissy. <BR>2&#41; Only in larger sizes.
    <BR> <BR>When I was doing my ATF Garamond cascade the smaller sizes were nothing
    but displeasure to work with &#40;not to mention all the spacing matter you have
    to struggle with - it feels so pointless&#41;. You spend half your time fighting
    the technology - I&#39;d rather spend my time conceptualizing. But yeah, rubbing
    some 48 point Palatino in your palm is fun. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    the fce when it was done ws named Univerist of California Old Style. Goudy had
    wanted to name it simply University, but the directors of the school felt the
    name to be too generic. <BR> <BR>In the mid fifties Lanston revised the design
    for its own purposes of production and sold the design under the current name,  Californian.

    years ago on a loan to an unprincipled-book-non-returner- bugger!&#41; you can
    search out just what Goudy cut. I believe that at the time all the sizes made
    for the University were done by Goudy at his workshop, and the type cast by him.
    I seem to recall that he cut 14, 18 and 24, with  few sorts for titling cut in
    36.  <BR> <BR>You can tell from Typologia just how much he did. I do know that
    all the early sizes and cast types were done by Goudy. <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    and for what it&#39;s worth, I have been involved in letterpress since I was a
    kid, and I will always like it. It feels good and it suits me. I Have no negative
    opinions about printing with polymer plates. If that feels good to the person
    doing it, then that&#39;s a good enough reason for them to do it; and they will
    make a buck much easier into the bargain. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s
    butt about all of letterpress&#39;s perceived drawbacks mentioned by others on
    this thread. Most of the problems noted were the result of poor craftsmanship
    and are hardly the fault of the craft. About the &#34;bad&#34; fitting of Linotype:
    it was one of the best ways of getting type set quickly and economically in acommercial
    world, and refinement mats were made to overcome all of the problem pairs. The
    refinement matrices had to be placed in the assembler by the operator by hand,
    and if was not done it was simply for lack of caring or for lack of the special
    refinement mats. Much work done on the Linotype was good by any standard. If there
    were a few inherent weaknesses in the technology, there seems little to be gained
    in lamenting it now. The Linotype, like other composing machines that preceded
    was the result of a gradual progression toward excellence and production.  <BR>
    <BR>I am certain that 30 years from now the same kind of stuff will be said about
    the very best of what is available to us today in typography. <BR> <BR>Without

    yesterday. That is not a fair comparison. Getting letterpress right was hard.
    It required taste and judgment at every stage: in design, in composition, in printing.
    It also had &#40;at least in some forms of the technology&#41; some real drawbacks
    typographically -- poorly fitted Linotype italics being, one. <BR> <BR>Printing
    has always had its nostalgic element. In the early 20th century, people looked
    back on handsetting, hand presswork, dampened paper and so on. &#34;Machine typesetting
    and high-volume printing,&#34; they said to themselves, &#34;what a falling away
    from the glories of the past.&#34; No doubt there were people who sadly lamented
    the decline of calligraphy in the face of movable type. <BR> <BR>And of course,
    they were in one sense right. But I cannot help feeling that there is another
    story to tell. For with each technological change, though something has been lost,
    there has also been something gained. <BR> <BR>So far as the move from metal typesetting
    to &#34;flat&#34; typesetting is concerned, of course there are losses. But they
    are not all to be regretted, especially if one looks at the quality of the average
    printed item, not the very best or worst. <BR> <BR>The really important thing
    is to work out what the important losses are, and whether they are really necessary.
    Many of the losses that have been made in the move from letterpress to litho,
    and in digitization, are not inevitable. With experience, designers of type for
    photographic composition can produce good designs. It is hardly surprising that
    in the infancy of that particular art some poor digitization took place, and some
    noble faces &#40;Centaur, Bembo, Baskerville&#41; were -- perhaps only temporarily
    -- vastly diminished. The real pity now is that with so much that is good and
    designed specifically for digital setting, the pallid ghosts of these old faces
    continue to haunt so many pages. Optical sizing &#40;where it matters: I suspect
    it is now being overdone; a sceptic like Hrant might like to note that it is very
    much in the economic interests of digital foundries to push optical variants&#41;
    can be recovered. Ligatures have always been there to be used, and only laziness
    or ignorance limits their proper use. <BR> <BR> <BR>The real loss may be the loss
    of craft. Digitization democratizes type. It blurs the distinction between the
    amateur and the professional, and between the trained and experienced professional
    and the novice. As software becomes more skilful in saving us from the mistakes
    of ignorance, the value of craft knowledge is reduced. Mr Rimmer is right to say:
    &#34;Those errors you point to are failures of technique&#34;. So they are. And
    in saying that, he has behind him the legitimate pride of the craftsman who has
    had to learn that technique and who feels, however dimly, the massed generations
    of those by whom the technique was developed and handed down. Digitization threatens
    to cut that link with the past, and reduced &#40;not, of course, eliminated--by
    no means&#41; the significance of craft training and skills. <BR> <BR>It is this,
    which is a cultural and human question, that seems to me to be the core issue
    digitization poses -- not the mere &#34;loss&#34; of a few old typefaces, or optical
    sizes, or faked small capitals. Those are problems that can easily enough be solved.
    But craft skills &#40;which are learned but not taught, largely unwritten, and
    largely incommunicable in writing&#41; once lost are hard to recover. <BR> <BR>&#40;This,
    of course, is not a new problem. It is the constant problem posed by industrialization.
    It is no less real for that, even if I do sound like William Morris.&#41;'

    I read a technical report where it was suggested as 5%. &#34; <BR> <BR>Gerald--I
    was wondering where you might have read this? While I have noticed that different
    types of plate material seem to gain differently during platemaking  &#40;case
    in point, a Printight plate I processed recently seemed to gain a lot more than
    a Jet plate I made from the same neg&#41;, it would seem to me hard to hold fine
    line screens on material that gains 5% in platemaking.  5% seems like the &#34;Mac
    Truck&#34; that G. Giampa was talking about! At 200 lpi I can&#39;t imagine these
    plates holding a reverse dot. <BR> <BR>And if this indeed happens, I wonder if
    offset plates have the same sort of gain during platemaking. I&#39;ve never read
    anything about this phenomenon before, but since it&#39;s also a film-based platemaking
    process I have to wonder. <BR> <BR>But I have to admit I&#39;m a skeptic that
    the platemaking is the root of letterpress&#39;s gain. Pulling a plate with minimal
    ink on a coated piece of paper shows minimal gain. Placing the neg overtop this
    proof shows very little difference between the neg and the plate. Print that same
    plate with enough ink to transfer well to an uncoated book paper, and a lot of
    gain occurs--enough to be visible, anyway. While gain might occur during platemaking,
    I still think that more occurs from the printing process.  <BR> <BR>Another reason
    that thin typefaces might appear more substantial when printed by letterpress
    from photopolymer is the thicker ink film that transfers to the paper on press.
    I believe I&#39;ve read that the ink film is four times as thick as the ink film
    transfered during offset printing. This extra density gives weight and, when properly
    printed, a sparkle to the type. <BR> <BR>Okay, sorry to be talkin&#39; shop here.
    This has been an interesting read so far and I hope I&#39;m not deadening it.

    in letterpress printing &#40;polymer or metal&#41; is one that baffles many newcomers
    to the craft. <BR> <BR>A conservative lay of ink, but not so much so that the
    type looks greyed, or you see the paper coming through is the only answer. It
    takes quite a bit of practice to get it right so that the type is defined and
    crisp. <BR> <BR>My approach, after screwing up a lot in the beginning, is to start
    piece with almost no ink. Next a pleasing amount of impression, without the extreme
    crushing of the paper so popular with some. Once the impression is set, I creep
    up on the ink, adding the barest amount until impression and ink lay suit me.
    It is absolutely necessary to print onto  hard packing and not into a soft base.
    <BR> <BR>Under-impressed, overinked type was what was aimed for in the trade in
    the fifties, in  a bid to &#34;immitate&#34; litho and its planographic look.
    This was even funnier than over-impression. <BR> <BR>Type foundries producing
    really works of art catalogues, notably the German ones would attain superb reproduction
    by running the different point sizes as separate pressruns, even if they were
    all black,  <BR>since 36 point is best addressed separately from 6 and 8 point.
    <BR> <BR>About the transition from metal to digital. Do you not think that the
    diiference is the that fact that three dimensional printing will always look different
    than planographic? Perhaps one of the things that also affect the attempt to re-create
    something like Centaur or Bembo or Garamond is that once it is in the hands of
    the person processing it on a computer, there is nothing to stop that person from
    messing with the tracking. <BR> <BR>Add that to general form and construction
    of each letter and the nearly intangible problem of correct weight, and it is  easy

    a fair criticism of some of the early digitizations that they were done poorly,

    birth pangs of a new technology. Some was just sloppiness -- and often as much
    on the part of users as on the part of the foundries. Use, say, Centaur without
    using oldstyle figures and ff ligatures, or with faked small capitals, when all
    are available, and you get what you deserve. <BR> <BR>But I do think letterpress
    is misunderstood, and to some extent, if I may use the word, idolised. It, too,
    had its limitations. There are some things that digital type can &#40;or could&#41;

    messing with tracking, slanting, the creation of fake sorts and so on&#41;. Unfortunately,
    the good points have perhaps been too little developed, and the bad points remain.

    not believe that we can realistically demand that a digital version of a metal

    <BR>I&#39;m struck recently by how beholden to the metal type paradigm digital
    typography still is. Despite the absence of any physical &#39;body&#39;, we are
    still essentially treating type as sequences of rectangles, rather than as sequences
    of letterforms. This paradigm is particularly obvious in our discussions about
    spacing: we talk about sidebearings and kerning as if this were the normal way
    to space letterforms, when any scribe or stonecutter would look at you funny if
    you suggested that he imagine a rectangle behind every letter and shift these
    rectangles and overlap or space them out. We talk solemnly about how the design
    of white space between and within letters is as important as the design of the
    letters themselves, but we continue to work with a paradigm that massively limits
    the ability to actually design the space between letters without the perverse
    explosion of thousands of kern pair adjustments to overcome the limitation of
    the rectangle. <BR> <BR>A few years ago, on the comp.fonts newsgroup I believe,
    Laurence Penney described a possible spacing model for digital type that involved
    designing the invisible, non-rectangular envelope that every letter should occupy
    regardless of its neighbours. Sequences of letters would be spaced by butting
    the envelopes of the letters against one another. Intrigued by this notion, I
    made some tests, first with unitised strips of spacing material because it was
    easiest, and then trying to actually design the ideal envelopes for each letter.
    It is difficult, but probably only because one isn&#39;t used to thinking in this
    way, but it works and is by far the best spacing model I&#39;ve seen &#40;and
    that includes the legendary Kindersley Optical Character Spacing system&#41;.
    However, I think the likelihood of the software industry en masse dumping the
    existing paradigm of digital type is very unlikely. <BR> <BR> <BR>While I tend
    to agree with Gerald that our humanity needs a physical connection to the past,
    I think we should also be aware that the manufacturing of metal type also compromised
    that humanity because of the nature of the material: we&#39;re not made of metal,
    and much as I love good letterpress printing and admire the craftsmanship that
    it represents, I&#39;m not sure it represents a sufficiently deep past in which
    to locate our humanity. My work on Arabic and, to a lesser extent, Hebrew has
    made me much more senstitive to pre-typographic ideas of spacing and layout, and
    I think there is a particular humanity in the freedom of arrangement that precedes
    the rectangle of the &#39;body&#39;.'

    Letterpress is the opposite. It exudes a sharpness lacking in lithography. Remember

  body: John, <BR> <BR><i>This is kerning applied after &#39;basic&#39; spacing, i.e.
    setting sidebearings.</i> <BR> <BR>I am not so sure how separate these proccesses
    are. With Fontographer this is accomplished in one and the same window. But I
    may suggest one logic, side bearings are good starting points for kerning. What
    I am saying is this. You would not wish to kern first and build side bearings
    afterwards? And If you were going to simply kern you will have to work hard to
    avoid creep. I have never been happy with auto kern, or auto side bearings. Both
    have been toyed with. Ikarus offered such features. <BR> <BR>Can I sell you guys
    my self tracking ligatures?

  body: 'Look at it this way: at the moment we already have this idea that sidebearings
    should relate to the letterform; that is why the sidebearing on bowls is less
    than that on straight stems. But the sidebearings still define the sides of a
    notional rectangle, because that was the shape made by the old metal type mould
    and on which font metrics have been based ever since. It is a shape that works
    reasonably well for the Latin script, and if you are working with metal and don&#39;t
    have an easy means of changing the shape of the mould relative to individual letterforms
    a rectangle is not a bad choice. <BR> <BR>All I&#39;m suggesting is that the &#39;digital
    mould&#39; should be more easily adjusted to correspond more closely to the shape
    of the letterforms, to correspond better, for example, to diagonal forms and to
    overhanging forms. This is what I mean by &#39;envelope&#39;, a kind of bubble
    that defines the space on which a letter sits &#40;and note that the letterform
    may, in some cases, extend beyond the bubble, e.g. at the extremes of the serifs
    on v&#41;. It serves the same function as the rectangular &#39;face&#39;, but
    is tailored to the letterforms. So rather than butting two rectangles up against
    each other and <i>then</i> making a secondary adjustment &#40;kerning&#41; to
    improve the spacing of particular pairs, one would butt the spacing envelopes
    against each other and, because they correspond more truly to the letterforms,
    no secondary adjustment would be necessary. Does that make sense?'

    <BR>Naive question though. While still locked into the rectangle concept, didn&#39;t
    PS3 allow for over extensions of the rectangle? All those &#34;your own handwriting&#34;
    font offers and the randomized fonts were/are possible in PS3, correct? <BR> <BR>Maybe
    the attempt to standardize, PS1, OT, are movements away from where we would ideally

  body: 'I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#39;over extensions of the rectangle&#39;.
    Do you mean simply parts of the letter extending beyond the edges of the notional
    rectangle of vertical em height and horizontal advance width? This is possible
    in any digital outline font format &#40;it is problematic for bitmaps&#41;. Indeed,
    the fact that the outline is no actually bound by the rectangle, that the rectangle
    is invisible and non constraining, is one of the reasons I think the rectangle
    is an anachronism: a virtual hold-over from a previous technology. <BR> <BR>Now,
    having said this, I should add that actually trying to design spacing envelopes
    that correspond to letter shapes is much harder than making rectangles. One solution
    is that spacing could be done simply by adjusting the position of letters relative
    to each other in an algorithmic series of contexts, and let the computer calculate
    the appropriate shape of the envelope to achieve the desired spacing. The number
    of steps you would need to go through for each letter would depend on the shape.
    Diagonals and overhangs would be the most complicated, but they are already and
    require the most kerning.'

    that you see rectangles, where I, with a long hot metal background do not. For
    that matter never did. I view the product on the paper. When grids irritated I

    this example has evidence of grid only on the outer corners. Those would be elimated

    but a long slug, or for those not familiar with the term, a bar of metal. <BR>
    <BR>But as far as grids go, or retangles as you put them, they never to be limitations
    for hot metal types, at least not often, when they were, such as &#34;script types&#34;,
    particularly the extremes from German and Dutch foundries you can view some very
    peculiar looking type bodies. Other faces, not even scripts, but Caslon Oldstyle
    Italic Swash was cast in a most unusual fashion. But wait, think about the obvious,
    why should we search for such extreme examples? Lower case italic y, j, overhanging
    f&#39;s, ligatures. Solutions, not limitiations. That&#39;s what I see, not rectangles
    and prisons. <BR> <BR>Also, no matter how you look at it, the objectives are the
    same even when the solutions are not'

    in fully articulated text. I don&#39;t consider smallcaps, oldstyle figures, etc,

    system -- developed over several hundred years of typography both fine and not,

    you really think the typographic universe is divided between fine typographers

    of type is set by graphic designers who have had, if we&#39;re lucky, enough typographic
    training to distinguish Bembo from Baskerville and may know what a ligature is.
    Most of the people I make fonts for are neither secretaries nor graphic designers;
    they are publishers and scholars. Do you really think these people are going to
    sit down and manually space a document, even presuming they knew how? Does that
    mean, as you suggest, that their books and journals should be printed without

    like Giampa &#40;if I may&#41; that were to show the way. This was when Emigre

    space type than sidebearings, I think even the envelope requires kerning overrides.
    Maybe it would require fewer of them, and would reduce the number of kern pairs
    in most fonts. <BR> <BR>But in my own tests of this, there were plenty of relatively
    common situations where it doesn&#39;t work all that well. What we really want
    to do is make optically even spacing by roughly equalizing the total amount of
    space between letters. If you stick an envelope on a shape like &#34;O&#34; and
    you stick two O&#39;s together, they end up a little too far apart &#40;at least
    in my experiments&#41;. <BR> <BR>But even if the envelope approach were better
    than I think it is, John is also exactly right that there&#39;s huge inertia of
    the existing type libraries, apps and OSes that make it so this will never happen.
    I don&#39;t think that the advantages over the status quo are sufficient to convince
    the relevant people to do the huge amounts of work to change those pieces. <BR>
    <BR>Gerald: Monotype and Linotype had metrics information for SPACING, that was
