  i have only the pages at hoefler & frere-jones to show her.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if anyone had examples of its use in print and signage that they would be happy
  to post up. Anything that demonstrates its versatility for both text and display,
  would be especially useful.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks in advance\r\n\r\nEd"

    second-largest free daily newspaper (that you can pick up outside subway stations
    in Stockholm). Most headings are Whitney. The text is Scala, I believe.

  body: I wonder if you e-mailed H&FJ if they might have some samples as well? I did
    use Whitney on a project, and was very happy with it. Some samples attached.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitney1_4803.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitney2_3496.jpg]

  body: "Whitney also happens to be the new corporate typeface for both VISA and Kodak.
    Kodak is still in the process of rolling out their new branding and logo, so I
    don't have many examples of that that I can show. The new logo has been discussed
    before I believe. Needless to say, it is not one of my favorites. But, that is
    neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nIf you look here:\r\n\r\nhttp://usa.visa.com/personal/visa_brings_you/advertising/index.html\r\n\r\nyou
    can see all of VISA's new ads, all using Whitney.\r\n\r\n-shu"
