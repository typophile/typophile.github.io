  Possibly another font from the google web fonts directory. \r\n\r\nThe font will
  be used as a support font for meta informations (author name, dates, etc.) so a
  simple, clean, anonymous one would be a good fit.  The website use Vollkorn for
  all the other text, titles and body, with generous use of bold weight for the titles.
  The mood of the site is straightforward (the site is about quality content from
  professional to professional, of every discipline) but elegant (do you think Vollkorn
  is an elegant font?  I feel the italic is and the bulky bold, while a lot \"in the
  face\" i think maintains a more refined esthetic than other fat bolds).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance"

  body: "I am aware of the rendering problems of the (mostly non Clear Type enabled)
    windows XP font rendering. But, if you would have looked at Vollkorn in Windows
    XP before answering,  you would have discovered that it renders good with Clear
    Type enabled, OK with the standard font smoothing, and a bit less good of Georgia
    without font smoothing at all. \r\n\r\nVollkorn has been probably hinted for screen
    and its letterforms shapes and high line\u2013height help a lot  with screen rendering.
    That said, your point is generally valid if you mean you have to look at the fonts
    in various systems and settings before using it on the web, but is not a universal
    rule valid for all fonts and all people."

    Good is relative, right."

    on windows xp with clear type, standard anti aliasing and no anti aliasing at
    all. Honestly I don't see differences that make me hope no one of the user is

  body: "charles_e \r\n\r\nas I said I don't think XP is a problem here, not for the
    user base but for the font rendering in itself. In addition the W3C stats are
    the stats of the W3C website not general web traffic stats. From what I know most
    of the current XP user base is in countries where there is no audience for my
    projects; being W3C a global site on average it register more XP user than websites
    visited only in certain countries. Also worth nothing that in the W3c stats you
    can see as XP is losing half of its share per year."

  body: "poms \r\n\r\nthanks for your input. Maybe \"elegance\" wasn't the best word
    in this case (not native english speaker). As I said I need something straightforward
    but not too much cold or rational/functional.  Vollkorn seemed to be enough clear
    but not too anonymous (the bold is quite heavy) or cold (the italic has a warm
    feeling to me) . I will think more about it. \r\n\r\nThanks again"

    an image of Vollkorn in Greyscale. On my Win PC this looks pretty bad. Both the
    spacing and the rendering of similar features suffers. That's just my opinion,
    anyway."

    misleading. Another factor that can have a pretty dramatic effect on Greyscale
    rendering is the brightness and constrast settings on your Windows computer.'
