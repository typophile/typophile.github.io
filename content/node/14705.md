body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Times New Roman</strong>\r\n\r\nTHE ubiquitous
  typeface of the second half of the 20th century. Developed by for The Times of London
  in [[1931]] (first used in October [[1932]]) and generally attributed to [[Stanley
  Morison]] (not least by himself, in <em>[[A Tally of Types]]</em>). There is some
  debate about its origin. In <em>A Tally of Types</em> Morison himself said that
  he had 'pencilled the original drawings' and handed them to [[Victor Lardent]],
  a draftsman in the Times' publicity department, who had produced finished drawings,
  which had then been worked on by the Monotype drawing office. When <em>A Tally of
  Types</em> was revised in [[1973]] a sceptical note was added, suggesting that it
  was likely that Lardent had carried out the actual design work based on some samples
  of [[Plantin]] that Morison had supplied. More recently, some have claimed it is
  the work of one [[Starling Burgess]].\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the personal computer,
  Times New Roman and similar fonts based on the same model have become a standard
  default typeface in many applications.\r\n\r\nFor more info about the disputed origin
