  body: Two serif faces with script-like serifs are [[Underware]]'s Dolly and [[Suitcase
    Type]]'s Dederon Serif. But they are quite different. I think that this is custom
    designed logo as well.

    three that might be similar in feeling, in addition to the ones Yves mentioned.
    I found these looking in the Sign Lettering section of the Script Font ID Guide:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/geis/\">Geis</a> from Galapagos,
    by George Ryan\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.unifonts.com/c_texhtm/cyranomodernregtex.htm\">Cyrano
    Modern</a> by Victor De Castro, Unifonts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.unifonts.com/a_pages/arjoriemedium.htm\">Arjorie</a>,
    also by Victor De Castro, Unifonts.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion both these guys are artists,
    who put a lot of personality into their fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
