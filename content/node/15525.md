  body: I've already looked at House Script, House Casual, etc., but the "L" didn't
    match. That's why I posted here. Like I've said, I've gotten really close, but
    no exact match. Do you know the precise name of the House Ind. font you're thinking
    of?

  body: Terrific, MS- I appreciate it. I've been scrolling through font sites and
    old spec books from the 60s for a long time, and hadn't hit Brody yet.
