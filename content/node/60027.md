  body: "It never had a resize grip, that's why you can't change it back.\r\n\r\nAttach
    another panel at the bottom that <em>has</em> a resize grip (drag it by its label
    towards the bottom of the character panel until you see a blue line, then release).
    Although you can change the width of the character panel now, with some experimentation
    I still can't make the new width \"stick\". As soon as I drag ways the attached
    panel it snaps back to default width.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, you can always
    try resetting the program preferences."

  body: "So silly yet so irritating. When I add another panel underneath with resize
    grip it only lets me make it bigger!\r\nIt was a French corporate magazine that
    did it, they had really long character style names. B*stards.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\nI
    don't really want to re set up any prefs I've got so I may just have to live with
    it."

  body: "Here's a way to fix it.\r\n1. Open the Character panel and attach it to the
    side of the column of minimized panels\r\n2. Attach a panel that can be resized
    (e.g. Table Styles) below the Character panel\r\n3. Use the grip above the Character
    panel (see highlighted in red in the image below) to change the width of the column
    of panels\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IDCS3_panels_6642.png]"

  body: "Thanks Miguel, I tried it but I think I have a little glitch. If you look
    at my image the lines that separate each section of the character window extend
    to the current edge of the window (they don't go any further, I can make the window
    larger because there is no lines but I can't make it smaller as the lines seem
    to block it)\r\n\r\nThanks again but I'll probably have to just live with it until
    i upgrade."

    else and see if that gets rid of your problem.
