  body: I see how you try to visualize the concept of creativity in the letterforms.
    So as a starting point it is okay, I guess. <BR>However - due to the quirky lowercase
    &#39;r&#39;, the whitespace between the capital C en the r is bothersome. The
    C seems to stand apart this way. This might be solved using a serif in the r after
    all. <BR>Furthermore, the spacing of e and a is bad. I can see how you want to
    emphasize the accent grave on the a, but it needs to be set much closer to the
    e.

  body: John, I totally agree with Bart. Since its a logo try making the c in Creative
    lowercase that would help with the space created by the c&#39;s counter.

  body: The face is Agendia from Ralf Herrman, except the C, which started from a
    Manfred Klein effort. Needs to move in? <BR> <BR>I had deliberately syllabified
    &#40;if that&#39;s a word&#41; partially to accent second sound and stress the
    long a. The e and a were deliberately separated. Too much english major influence,
    maybe?

  body: If you&#39;re going to separate the &#39;e&#39; and &#39;a&#39;, then you
    need to <i>really</i> separate them. It looks too much like and accident/poor
    typography. Perhaps a full word space or a black hyphen. <BR> <BR>Also, the &#39;r&#39;
    and &#39;i&#39; bother me. The dot on the &#39;i&#39; feels too close by just
    a hair &#40;may be the effect of the color difference&#41; and the &#39;r&#39;
    looks incomplete, or a little worm-ish to me. Bart and Dan&#39;s suggestion of
    a lowercase &#39;c&#39; sounds good to me, and my diminish this effect.

  body: In defense of Ralf Herrman, I had used the dotless &#39;i&#39; and constucted
    my own. His  dot is much &#40;I thought too much&#41; higher. <BR> <BR>Alternative
    font suggestions? I looked at about 6,000. Mainly because I couldn&#39;t figure
    out the proper descriptor for Agendia. Modern? Techno? <BR>Looks like a quieter
    &#39;Blue Island&#39; to me. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: It pains me to say it, but have you looked at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rotis">Rotis</a>?
    I don&#39;t like it for typesetting, but it might work for you here &#40;it&#39;s
    similar&#41;, particularly since you can pick from variations of serif, semi-serif,
    semi-sans, sans. That&#39;s if you want it to feel similar to the version you
    have. <BR> <BR>Have you explored any versions that are not solely typographic?
    The cubical/wall dividers thing could lend itself to some interesing visuals.

  body: 'I&#39;ve incorporated some of the forum suggestions, and would really appreciate
    your responses to this revision. <BR>  <BR>For the time being, I am on a solely
    typographic tack, simply because I have drawn a blank on art. I&#39;ve collected
    some fasteners and connectors from the client, and will use visuals in the other
    marketing materials. <BR> <BR>This is, indeed, a learning experience for me. All

  body: John you still have the e a spacing problem. That combination has to get more
    balanced. I still think a lowercase c on creative would help the color of the
    word.

  body: I agree with Daniel. <BR> <BR>The hook on the &#39;r&#39; still feels off
    to me. It&#39;s a bit too heavy for my taste. Perhaps a bit more stroke variation
    at the thin point. <BR> <BR>Could the &#39;C&#39; curve around the &#39;r&#39;,
    nestling it a bit &#40;on a dropped baseline&#41;? Like a set of dividing walls,
    maybe?
