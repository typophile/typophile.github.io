    are even more threads on more specific questions, like favourite serif faces.\r\n\r\nI
    don't like making lists generally, and I simply haven't used enough typefaces
    to come up with a list of favourites. I just don't think I can really call a typeface
    a favourite if I've only ever seen a type specimen on the web.\r\n\r\n'Favourite'
    is subjective and vague, and I think many people here will find this question
    too broad to answer anyway."

    is going to have its own requirements.  That said, I do have a short list of useful
    standbys that I'm personally fond of.\r\n\r\nSans: Frutiger, Futura, Helvetica,
    Syntax (not too original, am I? &lt;g&gt;)\r\nSerif: Adobe Jenson Pro, Bembo,
    Centaur, Palatino, Sabon, Schneidler\r\nJapanese: Epson Ky\xF4kasho, Kochi-Subst
    (or Sazanami) Mincho, M+ 2C \r\n\r\nI've never actually tried them, but lately
    I've been admiring some recent discoveries:<ul>\r\n<li>Novel Sans Pro (also Rounded)\r\n<li>Comenia
    Sans\r\n<li>Goudy Text CT (from Castle Type; OTOH I don't much care for the Monotype
    version)\r\n<li>LTC Metropolitan Italic Alt (a bit closer to Arrighi's original
    than Warde)\r\n<li>Poetica (esp. Poetica Chancery III)\r\n</ul>\r\n"

  body: "Times (New) Roman was designed for a particular purpose, and fulfills that
    purpose quite admirably.  If you want to fit a relatively large amount of prose
    into a constrained space without overly sacrificing readability, aesthetics, or
    professionalism, it's a fine choice.  (Or, as an acquaintance of mine put it,
    \"In a two-inch-wide newspaper column, Times Roman is da bomb.\")  The main problem
    with it IMO is that it tends to be egregiously misused.\r\n\r\nBTW I thought Stanley
    Morrison designed it?"
