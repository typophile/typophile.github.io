  our new Photo kiosk bar in my photolab.  I was hoping somone might be able to give
  me some suggestions on improving our logo.  We are required to use one of teh two
  Kodak logos I have attached (attachment 2 & 3) and our current logo is attachment
  1.  We have changed the tagline on the logo several times over the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nYour

    logo.\r\n\r\nI would also get rid of the centering, and experiment with putting
    the whole name on one line."

  body: "Take a look at Vista from Emigre. A nice Sans Serif face with character.
    I would make your company name prominate. Stack it above the Kodak logos where
    possible and make the Kodak logo a lot smaller. What is important isn't the process
    or the equipment, or the potential client would just send their images straight
    to Kodak. Your company and your people make the difference. Kodak is just a trademark
    that they can trust. \r\n\r\nThe problem with your current typeface is it doesn't
    look serious enough. It would be a great typeface for an ice cream vendor. "

  body: "The only restriction from Kodak is that we must use their logo (either the
    square one or the rectangle one) and that the two parts (their logo and our name/logo)
    must fall in between the 60%-40% mark.  Theirs could be 60% or 40% of the entire
    logo or anything in between. \r\n\r\nActually the  60/40 is only for the sign
    out front but I would like the sign and the logo to compliment each other.\r\n\r\nBen\r\nwww.photoplus.us"

  body: "I think, given those restrictions, you should look at emphasising that you
    are a company who happens to use Kodak equipment, in other words your name should
    appear first when reading left to right or top to bottom, also consider a colour
    away from the red of Kodak. I would steer clear of using a similar shaped box,
    icon or typestyle (in fact I wouldn't use any icon or swoosh, as it will probably
    clash with the Kodak logo). I am not suggesting you produce anything that looks
    like the two elements are fighting, more that you give your company a prominence
    that Kodak doesn't need.\r\nSo sketch out the areas/shapes that your logo will
    have if you work with a 50:50 split with the Kodak logo. Look at colours that
    could be an alternative to red without clashing (so that will cut out many greens),
    or being too light to read if printed on white (yellow), then try to create a
    shortlist of the kinds of typeface that you feel works for your company name.\r\nHope
    this gives you a start.\r\nTim"

  body: 'The last two versions are better. Please don''t set your name verticaly.
    It looks like a mistake. Make it smaller and flush left with the word photo. If
    you can make it work have the Kodak Image Center Solutions appear after and not
    before your name. The version on the white background (color wise) works. If you
    insist on the red back ground make your name and Photo in white. Remember Stop
    signs are white type against a red background for a reason. They can be seen from
    far off. Also you have to make a white stroke around the blue Plus and stripes
    because the value of blue and red are the same. If you were to xerox the blue
    against the red on a black and white copier the Plus and stripes would disappear.  '

  body: "I think 3.2 represents an advance in that your company is dominant (although
    the ratio seems to have been reduced to 80:20 in your favour), the colours separate
    your business from the Kodak logo and the basics of your services are clear. However,
    the camera icon has a dated appearance and might be unnecessary, the speed lines
    might work better if they joined the P of Plus and tapered to the left or the
    slant that you presently have on the right could be moved to the left. The black
    outline on the white out text could also be viewed as unnecessary, if you decide
    that you prefer to retain the outline perhaps you could look at making them of
    equal weight. In the strapline I suggest that you use an en dash instead of a
    hyphen and consider whether developing is a term that customers would accept in
    place of, for example, processing which has more correlation with digital photography
    and still relates to the developing and printing of film. I am not clear on your
    intentions for using both but I would advise against it in order to retain a single
    identity, if you are concerned about the background to which you are applying
    your logo you could look at using a white border on the red box and reverse out
    the type for a dark background. My overall view is that in order to produce a
    logo which sits comfortably with the set element (the Kodak logo) you should go
    with a simple style.\r\nTim"
