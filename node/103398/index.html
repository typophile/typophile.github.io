The lettering for this cover is representative of the fashion of the day. Note the tilde shaped bar on the E and F.  A few fonts, not all digitized, with this effect: Titania, Pretorian, Gazebo, Oriente (Oliver), Harlech, Grange, Olympian.

		<div class="commentbody">This lettering was used on the first edition published by F. Warne &amp; Co. in 1902.  Enhanced excerpt of the lettering on the cover, taken from my files:
<img src="/images/old-images/CoverLetteringExcerptedAndEnhanced_3674.jpg" alt="">
Excerpt of the lettering on the cover of a later edition:
<img src="/images/old-images/CoverLetteringExcerpted_6313.jpg" alt="">
Note that it looks similar but is more crudely executed.
The practice in the trade was to attempt to keep the tone consistent for a series &ndash; which would explain the distinctive titling for your Beatrix Potter books.
In later years fonts were chosen that approximated the original lettering.
Here is a 1999 edition with a font that is a pretty good match to the original lettering:
<img src="/images/old-images/CoverTitlingExcerpted_5399.jpg" alt="">
I suspect that it is a private font produced for F. Warne &amp; Co. 
Anyway, its not in my folder with tilde shaped bar fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">I confirmed that F. Warne is in fact currently using the font. See <a href="http://www.peterrabbit.com/">http://www.peterrabbit.com/</a> where it appears in an interative book, perhaps as a Flash font excerpt. 
Penguin bought F. Warne in the 1980s and spend money on reviving the business. I suspect this included development of the new font. It might have been in-house or by contract. Some contracts, such as the well known one by the Economist magazine for Officina display, have an exclusive use period followed by return of rights to the designer for sale as the designer wants. In this case it seems Penguin/Warne have retained the rights and it will not be available for sale to the public any time soon.
However, there is no copyright restriction on using the original lettering of 1902 to create an original font, without using any of the digital data owned by Penguin/Warne. See sample:
<img src="/images/old-images/EandF_FromOriginalLettering_4521.jpg" alt="">
The question is whether anyone would pay for it. If there is no market, it&rsquo;s not worth doing.

Certainly Warne would take action if such a font was used to promote Beatrix Potter stories, which can be freely distributed because they are in the public domain with long expired copyright, but are still cash cows for Warne because of the &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the Warne product. Echos of Disney &amp; The Mouse that extended intellectual property rights for generations after the creators have ceased to exist. IP is going to be a big issue in the upcoming decades. Plenty of employment for lawyers. Plenty of money for mega companies, not much for the actual creators.
BTW AFAIK the lettering was not done by Potter. At least it&rsquo;s not mentioned in books about her that I have checked.

It is an original creation made from scratch in Fontlab.
It is based on the original book covers lettering from 1902 to 1910.  There are almost two dozen, each with a variation of the same lettering style.

You may check some at Archive.org. Search for Beatrix Potter.
Lettering artists of the era tended to copy one another so this is not a particularly original design. 
The tilde shaped bar seems to have been first used by Thayler.
The T with raised spikes is a very common 19th century style.  See for example the digital revival from Canada Type. <a href="
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/">Ronaldson</a> designed vy  Alexander Kay, Rebecca Alaccari and Patrick Griffin. Recommended for purchase. 
The R, which varies from cover to cover, is a common style for lettering in the era.

		<div class="commentbody">As mentioned in previous posts the private font produced for F. Warne &amp; Co. will probably not be made available. But there ARE  some fonts with similar features in the &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; category &ndash; i.e. Baskerville etc. This Warne variation might be described as being in an English vernacular style. Note its low contrast and large rounded serifs dished at the midpoint.
I recommend <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/plantagenet/">Plantagenet</a> by  Ross Mills of Trio Typeworks. Some letter forms are quite different, but the flavor is the same.
