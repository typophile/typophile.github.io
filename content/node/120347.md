    rip-off) of Kabel, and I should have caught that.\r\n\r\nI struggled with MARKETING\u2014any
    other suggestions besides Savigny?"

    and dropped name after you did without refreshing.\r\nSame for me on 'MARKETING'.
    Savigny works but don't think it is the one (mainly because of /R bowl outlines).
    To be honest, I'm actually hesitating between mash-up and freebie: /M: Avant-Garde/Helvetica;
    /R Avenir, /K Futura, /G Gotham...\r\nIgnition Marketing Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ignitionmarketingph\r\nIgnition

    but /K is still off. There's also [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/muli|Muli]]
    but /R is off. Before that, I was on Museo Sans, Open Sans and Lato.

    this.\r\nI can settle for the closest ones. I don't mind that much if it's not
    the same exact font.\r\n\r\n"
