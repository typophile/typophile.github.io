body: Hola Typophiles, <BR> <BR>This is a new pixel font family, inspired in the early
  and classic &#34;Chicago&#34; by Susan Kare, but more complete and crisp, because
  it have greyscale antialiasing. Please post your coments or critiques, <BR> <BR>Thanks
  a lot. <BR> <BR>mh <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23779.gif"

  body: I think pixel upright italics are pretty, but they suffer from being too dark.
    <BR>Since this is a grayscale experiment, maybe you should use the grays to compensate
    its color &#40;darkness&#41;.

  body: Pretty nice! Just the &#34;g&#34; is one pixel too deep. <BR>And that &#34;upright
    italic&#34; actually has a chance of working to some extent as emphasis, since
    it&#39;s both narrower and darker. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: i not agree with the g <BR> <BR>i think yo have to use the another kind of
    g.. <BR>your style is simple, and the actual g have many information for a pixel
    font. <BR> <BR>Hrant have the reason, but your problem is not a pixel more or
    a pixel less, you have a structural problem. <BR> <BR>prueba esoa ver si resulta
    <BR>en la eurostyle por lo menos resulta <BR>JP

    from Chicago. The only think that i want to keep is the size, because for a big
    pixel fonts, can be a complete and new option for designers. <BR> <BR>I understand
    that the name was used for companies like the Apple Records or for Apple software,
    bacause of the relation with Chicago, is illegal to keep the name?? can be a trouble,
    i am walking on ice? <BR> <BR>mh'

    were something like Applez, then that is a different story.

    the color, they suffer for been too Blocky &#40;geometric&#41; and near from old
    pixel fonts too. <BR> <BR>I am back with Apple using Multiple Grayscale shades.
    I post the first new Apple image to get your feedback. <BR> <BR>I build and test
    this font in a LCD screen at 1152 x 768 &#40;powerbook g4 15&#34;&#41;, for been
    used in similar screens,small pdas, cellphones and in E-Ink, who uses grayscale
    colors. For the moment i am on those 3 light regular and bold versions, but upright
    italics its in developing yet.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47355.gif"
