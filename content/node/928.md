    <BR> <BR>In my point-of-view, Zurich is not to Univers what Arial is to Helvetica.
    <BR>The Zurich issue &#40;naming, copyright&#41; is different from Arial issue
    &#40;design&#41;.

    The whole  <BR>Helvetica/Arial, Times/Times New Roman PS etc. thing  <BR>is a
    naming and copyright thing too.

  body: Zurich <i>is</i> Bitstream&#39;s version of Univers. The designs are as close
    as any two versions of the same typefaces can be except in name. Now that they&#39;ve
    reached reached an agreement with Linotype, they will be <i>calling</i> it Univers
    as well. <BR> <BR>This will never happen with Arial. It&#39;s superficially similar,
    but its details are quite different from Helvetica. They do share the same character
    widths and weights. This is due to the fact that Arial was created as a substitute
    for Helvetica.

    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s exactly why I regard it as a naming and copyright  <BR>thing
    too. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Zurich has the &#40;original?&#41; ampersand.</i> <BR>
    <BR>Yes, that&#39;s the original. Adobe sure did an awful job  <BR>at digitizing
    those early fonts. That&#39;s why FontShop  <BR>always recommended the Bitstream
    versions to users.
