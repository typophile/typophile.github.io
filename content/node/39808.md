  body: "You're dead on.  Love his stuff.  Wood type makes a lot of sense.. is there
    anything similar font available?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of making a fake gigposter-inspired
    tshirt design for a band that I design for, so I'm hoping to start with a base
    font and mix it up from there."

  body: You beat me to it. I was about to say Hatch Show. These appear to be letterpress,
    mixed wood block type.

  body: Hatch does some really nice stuff. I live in Nashville and wish I had gotten
    an internship there. Unfortunately, Jim Sherraden had already hired his summer
    interns. Really nice guy. It's all 100-year old wood type on letterpress. Fantastic
    stuff in an age where design sometimes gets too "clean." Hooray for getting ink
    on your hands. :)

  body: "The fact it's a poster for the Ryman pretty much gives it away as a Hatch
    piece.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Blinc, we did some fonts based off of wood type for
    Chank (which I now see has already been mentioned). There's also usually an ad
    in most of the design rags for someone selling a wood type CD that is scans of
    wood type alphabets.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, if you're ever in Nashville, definitely
    hit Hatch. Jim is, indeed, a very nice guy."
