  a daily basis.\r\nSo, I'd love to get some hints and pointers on the kerning in
  the text below, because things are starting to look all the same...\r\nParticulary
  the \"TSUTV\"-part is hard to balance evenly against the rest, and the loose tracking
  doesn't really make it easier. \r\nDid I just mess it up? Be harsh. It's alright.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\nPs. It says \"Property Development\" in swedish,
  in case you wanted to know. Ds.\r\n\r\nKerning:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fastighetsutveckling1_6699.jpg]\r\nAuto-set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fastighetsutveckling2_3981.jpg]"
