  font for a design project. I'm doing the logotype for a church, and I need an organic
  script font to use for the word \"Genesis.\" Ideally something very readable, something
  that feels very natural and looks current and clean. Any help is hugely appreciated!\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: i definitely like ambience the best out of those 5, and it's a great start.
    i wouldn't say i'm looking for something formal, more casual is okay too. however,
    i definitely want to stay away from anything that comes off as unprofessional.
    thanks for the help.

    (e and s) so you'll want to edit your headline so that at least the 's's aren't
    identical. Cut off the trailing tail on the ending 's' for instance. Some fonts,
    like Ambiance, have contextual alternates for this purpose, but there aren't many
    in this genre."
