  body: "I agree ARMY is similar to Futura Heavy & Century Gothic Bold. If you used
    Futura Heavy you could flip the W to get a more sloped M. If you standardize the
    capital height of Futura Heavy & Century Gothic Bold, you could Century Gothic
    Bold for A & Y, and a flipped W for M, plus Futura Heavy for the R.\r\nDon"
