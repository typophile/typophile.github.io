  body: "I have also seen this in German science books circa 1900 but, like you, I
    don't know the name.\r\nAFAIK it has not been digitized.\r\nThe two story g with
    the ear out of the top of the bowl is rare in serifed typefaces.\r\nLitho Roman
    -- designed by Inland Type Foundry in 1907 onwards-- has the g.  Several weights
    and variations were produced by Inland before its merger with ATF in 1912. For
    a specimen see: \r\nhttp://dailytypespecimen.com/post/30458775686/litho-roman-specimen\r\nAccording
    to Mac McGrew's book on American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century, the Litho
    typefaces\r\n---start quote---\r\nare intended to imitate a style of lettering
    popular with lithographers in the days when lettering and designs were carefully
    drawn on lithographic stones. This process was especially in demand for high-quality
    stationery and announcements. The original Litho Roman is rather heavy, with fine
    hairlines. Serifs on heavy strokes are slightly filleted, while those on hairlines
    are heavy triangles. The ear of the g starts straight up from within the bowl,
    and in some series the tail of the cap R is not quite connected to the bowl.\r\n---end
    quote--\r\nI have lettering similar to your font on maps lithographed for Petermann
    in the 19th century.\r\nDon\r\n"

    Florian Hardwig]] from the same discussion:\r\n<blockquote>this is one of those
    <strong>special typefaces for cartography</strong>. They used to have pretty generic
    names, like \u2018<strong>Kartenschrift</strong>\u2019 [map type]. Hard to find
    samples.\r\nYour best option might be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roemisch|R\xF6misch
