    with its corporate communications\u2014in particular copywriting?\r\n\r\nI've
    recently taken issue with the text for the Letter.2 competition, (and it was changed\u2014thanks
    Jos\xE9). \r\nAnd now this.\r\n\r\nWhat's the big deal with the T-shirt?\r\nIt's
    little details like this that grind. For instance, by replacing \"a structure\"
    from the ATYpI About page by \"the structure\" here, you go from understated fact
    to self-aggrandizing fibbing. Because Typophile, for instance, is also *a* structure
    for communication, information and action amongst the international type community.\r\n\r\nAnd
    what is the distinction in mentioning both \"information\u2026amongst\" and \"communication\u2026amongst\"?
    And what noun(s) does the preposition \"amongst\" qualify\u2014structure, or the
    three \"-ions\" in the subordinate clause? Your writing is perfectly acceptable
    for a personal post to Typophile, but as corporate communication, I'm afraid it
    is too amateurish. "

    of years ago to moderate a panel discussion at the RGD's <em>Design Thinkers</em>
    conference. When I showed up for the gig, I was given a sheet of paper with my
    introductory text prepared, \"Hello, my name is Nick Shinn\u2026\" which continued
    with a short bio of myself and the panelists, and an introduction to the topic.
    That shows the kind of control that an organization's information officer can
    exert. It's all about consistent branding, and words are just as much a part of
    that as typography and design."

    people know that registration is available - quickly. ...And to give a bit of
    context. \r\n\r\nMany people know what this event is - but not everybody. It isn't
    really my text. The writing isn't pro because it is done by volunteers. Simple
    really... Also, mine would be worse I suspect.\r\n\r\nI have changed the \"the\"
    to \"a\" the the top post. I quite agree about that. I'll ask them to change the
    web site as well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the non profit type orgs will get someone in
    charge of this \"branding thing\" at some point. But it will still need to be
    a a volunteer thing. How good will it be? <Shrug><hand waving...>\r\n\r\nJames,
    it is easy to be \"premier\" when you are arguably the only world wide org in
    the category. But just for argument sake - on what org would you place that mantle?
    But also so much kveching,.."

    correct me if I'm wrong: Typo Berlin 5,327, TDC events 96-564, TypeCon 647, ATyPI
    538, SPECTORem 12.\r\n\r\n>...for the longest time ATypI headquarters was in West
    New York, New Jersey\r\n\r\nThe longest time? I'm having trouble parsing. \r\n\r\nAlso
    consider that some conferences are produced and directed by organization members
    and are just a part of their organization's activities. While a separate huge
    block of conferences, from & to SXSW, are conference-based entities with annual,
    or semi-annual rites and not another thing to do, because the conference (and/or
    their real jobs), is enough.\r\n\r\nThe distance between any of these and old-ATypI
    is incomprehensible to anyone who didn't attend in those days. No guests not a
    spouse or child, No presentations except the state of the association, Two buses
    for outings, one for the men and one for the rest, and almost no discussion of
    what anyone was going to do, how, or what they had done, or why, typographically
    or technically over the past year or the next. \r\n\r\nThe \"workshop\" conference
    at Stanford started changing the latter. Type90 the blew lid off it, and TypeLab
    kept anyone from putting the lid back on, for longest time. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"How many attend typographic events like Typo Berlin, TDC events, TypeCon,
    etc. as compared to ATyPI?\"\r\n\r\nTypo Berlin runs several thousand people.
    It is far and away the largest.\r\n\r\nTypeCon has varied quite a bit over the
    years. It started out very small (under a hundred), gradually ramped up until
    it was running at 400-550 (maybe San Francisco was the high water mark?), and
    then has declined a bit in recent years to be more like 200-350. I'm imagining
    that timing it right after the 4th of July in hotter climates allows for an inexpensive
    venue, but those same two factors may have also hurt attendance.\r\n\r\nATypI
    has mostly run pretty consistently around 300-350 for the last six years or more,
    with very occasional upwards bumps for assorted reasons. I expect Reykjavik will
    run around 300, maybe a little less due to the economy combining with it not being
    as obvious a \"destination\" location as say Dublin was. But I think the lineup
    of talks is looking great!\r\n\r\nI can't speak to attendance at various kinds
    of TDC events.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    agree that Typo Berlin has a different focus, more on typography within current
    graphic design. It has none of the academic talks one sometimes sees at ATypI,
    no talks aimed at type designers and type foundries as audience members, and little
    of the other material one sees on designing type. But I figure maybe half the
    talks one sees at ATypI or TypeCon would be ones that would also be welcome at
    Typo Berlin?\r\n"
