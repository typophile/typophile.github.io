  anyone here participating in the Public Beta (available here -- http://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_win_beta.php)?
  \ I'm not sure if it's as new as the press release, so maybe it's too soon.\r\n\r\nSince
  FontExplorer X PC has so far proven to be an unmitigated disaster, I wonder if FontAgent
  might step up and compete with Suitcase as the preferred PC font manager.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any info about FAPro Win, I'd be interested to hear what you think."

    --- http://typophile.com/node/27616 -- and tales of woe elsewhere on the interwebs.\r\n\r\nBut
    in brief: crashes on startup, file corruption and registry damage. Many problems
    are now listed on the Linotype download page.  Basic functionality issues are
    not to be excused by the 'beta' tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>So... FontAgent for Windows
    </em>\r\n"

  body: "If you want a product that is officially released and supported, you may
    want to try Suitcase for Windows. It has auto-activation for InDesign, Illustrator
    and Quark.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I sometimes test beta software with Virtual PC.
    A lot of times, installers are the last part of an application to be finalized
    and it can be tricky to get remove an application manually. It could be that FontAgent
    is closer to release, but if it still must have significant outstanding issues
    or it wouldn't be a beta."

  body: I'm currently a Suitcase user and have no specific complaints, just like the
    idea that competition on the Windows platform might result in some more feature-rich
    applications or updates.
