body: "Hi. Long time listener, first time caller. \r\n\r\nI have a client who hates
  the overhanging terminal on the lower case \"a\" and has requested that I use a
  sans serif font without said terminal in creating her brand. In my rather small
  font collection I'm only finding Futura and House Chalet NineteenEighty having truncated
  terminals on the a. Does anyone out there have any other suggestions that I might
  consider? Many thanks in advance."

    Also many italics have that too, of course. Maybe you could draw the letter yourself?

    I'd goof up the nomenclature on my first post. Thanks for your suggestions. I
    really like Proxima Nova. \r\n\r\nBut looking like Avant Garde is the winner.
    \r\n\r\nMany thanks for all your comments. Especially nutjob. I have another client
    who is a baker and hates circles. Always on the lookout for square muffin trays."

    not lead to text being used in AG. My current college had a nice wordmark built
    using Avant Garde Light, and the braintrust in marketing later decided that for
    \"branding\" they would use the similar Century Gothic as the default font for
    everything. The website, the college calendar (in 9 point, in many places) and
    all brochures.\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder why there is no design program at this college.\r\n"
