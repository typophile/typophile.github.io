  that the client name is Annabel June.  I'm curious to see how this logo is being
  interpreted, and if it is translating the way it should. \r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: I would interpret the logo as containing the letters "Le", although I'd also
    be inclined to think of it as a decorative swirl unless there were some context
    to help me interpret it as letters.

  body: exactly my problem. What would bring out it's inner A while still maintaining
    this fluid line?

  body: I would make the left stem of the A heavier and the loops a bit lighter. I'd
    also want both stems a bit closer at the top. I find that line inside the right
    stem a bit distracting. I associate an inscribed line like this with carving or
    etching, rather than the fluid line of a pen or brush.

  body: "I read \"Le\" as well. I think if it were paired with the words, I would
    get it right away. But without context, it's reading wrong. \r\n\r\nI would try
    doing something different with the \"loop\" at the top of the left stem. To me,
    that is really what makes it look like an \"L\". Maybe have it curl in the other
    direction, or have it sweep in to the right, and taper toward the right stem as
    if it were going to join paths with the right stem.\r\n\r\nIts a pretty nice-looking
    mark though. Good luck. "

    and I saw an A, not Le.

  body: The new stroke weights are better but that open apex is still a bit troublesome,
    especially as the loop on the top of the left one looks as if it is trying to
    grab the right to pull it closer.

  body: "Dave I really like what you are doing but I'd like to keep my overall shape
    because of a few subtleties I have built into the design.\r\n\r\nThe client works
    with weddings and by using the current form I'm able to reference two themes :
    a heart, and Infinity (both of which are indicative of marriage). \r\n\r\n The
    main concern is for it to look like an A, but these subtitles are important (even
    if they go unnoticed)\r\n\r\nSo If there is a way I can tweak the current form
    to read \"I'M AN A!\" that would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your
    input guys, it's really helping me out."

    of the right stem, which I already said it looks as if it wants to, you\u2019d
    get a better heart shape and a clearer A."

  body: if you commit to executing the mark with a calligraphic pen, you'll notice
    what comes naturally to the stroke & widths. I would recommend taking this back
    to pen & paper in that sense. Keep what you have conceptually and understand it
    more literally.

  body: Oh YES! Luma Wine's version reads much better as an A, but would need more
    interconnected tops.
