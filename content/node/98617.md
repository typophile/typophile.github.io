body: "I'm choosing a typeface for a magazine, and I've decided that Baskerville is
  the one for me. The magazine is meant to have a sober, timeless feeling to it, without
  being intimidating or stuffy, and I feel that Baskerville hits all the right notes
  in that regard.\r\nNow the problem becomes, which one? I'm choosing between several
  versions, including Linotype, URW++, Monotype, ITC, and Storm's Baskerville Original
  Pro. \r\n\r\nWe're printing on both uncoated and coated stock, usually at 9pt size.
  I've found that the first version I bought, from URW, tends to look too thick, and
  doesn't quite have the level of readability and lightness that I want. Of course,
  I could buy them all and experiment, but we're a small independent magazine, and
  the budget's not there for that.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear if anyone has an opinion
  about their favorite version of Baskerville, and why. Thank you!"

      was using to set type in 1983, and how that would have resulted in fake italics?"

    built for that. You could use one with an inflated x-height (basically I'm thinking
    of ITC Baskerville) to look OK at smaller sizes, but that would be a joke.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: As you may have guessed by now, I'm using Dragon magazines from the mid-'80s
      as my model for type choices. At that time, they were fitting 1500+ words per
      page. I've measured their type, and as near as I can tell by comparing it to
      my own printouts, it's nine point Baskerville. It's possible they were using
      ITC, but it doesn't look like it to me. You can see for yourself in the sample
      I posted above.

    be Storm's Baskerville 10, designed for smaller point sizes (10 and below). I
    was afraid that might be the case, as theirs is one of the most expensive. \r\n\r\nI'm
    still holding on to hope that Monotype's Baskerville will work for me, but as
    you point out, it may not be suitable at that size."

    almost certainly have been provided by the manufacturer of the equipment. I\u2019m
    only familiar with some of the Compugraphic machines from that time. I don\u2019t
    know if they had their own version of Baskerville, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.
    Compugraphic was swallowed by Agfa, which was then taken over by Monotype, if
    I recall my consolidations correctly.\r\n\r\nSkyfonts.com has four different Baskervilles
    you can try out for free if you join the beta programme. (Have your specimen sheet

  body: 'Jayson, maybe I''m late to the party, but: Monotype''s and Storm''s are at
    the opposite sides in terms of darkness and readability, the former being the
    lighter and the latter being the heavier. I''m not sure that Monotype''s digital
    version would be the best choice for a magazine setting. Fountain''s revival is
    an elegant rendition but maybe a bit too stiff for my taste; it also lacks the
    lining figures in the italics and doesn''t have a bold (which could be limiting
    in a magazine). Storm''s version looks like a more faithful rendition (compared
    to others), but I see its design more appropriate for books with a classical feel
    rather than contemporary magazines. For what is worth, I think that ITC New Baskerville,
    in its apparent averageness, is still the best Baskerville option for a magazine
    text setting. The sample you posted - fake italics apart - seems set in ITC''s
    to me.'
