  body: "I was starting to look for some other Gothic Moderne styles, like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_motel_gothic_ot_regular/?&sample_text=SWEET%20PICK'D%20FOR|FF
    Motel Gothic]] by Jim Parkinson, or Jason Walcott's similar style, whose name
    I can't recall, (and Veer is down right now)...\r\n\r\n... but, what the heck
    Lex nailed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
