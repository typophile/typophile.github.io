		<div class="commentbody">It's expensive because it's high quality and there really isn't any other design like it, so if you want to use it, you'll have to buy it.

Similar fonts:
http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/sans_geometric/ - Not free, but you may have one of them already.

http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/style/Sans%20Serif - Check here for good quality free fonts.

Just off the top of my head, I think Kabel and Bernhard Gothic look similar in that they are geometric and slightly quirky.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for your responses, I do appreciate the help greatly.  I have been a graphic designer for 5 years, but I've always just chosen a font that looks good, without any real thought into the typography process.  Justin, you say those fonts are low quality, but I'm afraid I don't understand what a low quality font means.  To my eyes, and I could be grossly mistaken, all fonts look the same "quality". I mean, they don't have aliased edges and what not.  Is it a spacing or kerning issue?  What separates a good quality font from a bad quality one?

Are there any resources for learning the basics of typography, and what font choices I should be looking for in certain circumstances?  I apologize if I sound like a novice, I'm really not.  I'm just more of a visual effects artist, who also happens to do a little motion graphics work as well.

Thank you all for your incite and suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Straight off the bat I'd say that answering what separates good quality from bad is the same with everything - you can tell the difference between and cheap town car (not naming any names) and a full spec Mercedes right? It's about what has gone into something that makes it good quality; Time, effort, research & skill. If you're saying you've been a graphic designer for 5 years (and I don't doubt that) then you should start seriously looking into the finer points of typography - it can only help you and improve your understanding of what works and why people are willing to pay the kind of prices you see from these font foundries.

Neutra may seem a little expensive, but considering the different weights you get for your money and the fact that you're getting a font that not every spotty young wannabee with a few free fonts and a cracked copy of photoshop may have will lift your designs above the mediocre. You'll find a lot more mileage from a decent, well thought out font than you may realise.

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting points, Jazz.  Almost 100% of my work is for film or TV, so my workflow is probably different from many on this forum.  I rarely ever do print work.  I will look into some typography books and tutorials. It never hurts to have more skills! :)</div>
