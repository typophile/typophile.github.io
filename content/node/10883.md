body: Sorry, not the type 3. &#40;By the way Chaucer&#39;s translation of Boethius
  <i>De consolatione philosophiae,</i> printed by Caxton in 1478, contained a lot
  of type 3.&#41; <BR> <BR>The typeface shown above was used for <i>Sarum Hours</i>
  V and VI, one octavo and one quarto. <BR> <BR>So, you have the typeface and 2 books
  to find.

  body: Matha <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve only really left me with Type 8, which I only have
    a lowercase specimen of. It matches this but the key to fraktur is its uppercase.
    Type 5&#39;s lowercase does not match and Type 7 seems to have been little used
    for bookwork. Nor do its caps match.  <BR> <BR>At any rate, I only have reference
    to Type 8 being in Tretyse of Love and Ars Moriendi.

  body: 'Gerald, <BR> <BR>It <b>is</b> type 8.  <BR>I hope this didn&#39;t take up
    too much of your morning. I chose a sample without too many examples of uppercase
    letters, so maybe it was a little difficult. Well done, anyway. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    have any refernce to <i>Tretyse of Love</i> in my source &#40;Nicholas Barker&#39;s
    &#39;Caxton&#39;s Typography&#39; in the <i>Journal of the Printing Historical
    Society</i> no. 11&#41; <BR> <BR>Of the four books he says were printed using
    this typeface, only 2 survive : <BR><i>Ars moriendi</i> <BR>and a reprint of Mirk&#39;s
    <i>Liber festivalis,</i> <BR>both partially set in type 8. <BR> <BR><i>Sarum Hours</i>
    V and VI, entirely set in type 8, have disappeared. <BR> <BR>Barker suggests four
    possible suppliers of type 8: Anthoine V'

  body: Matha <BR> <BR>Well, Barker would certainly know. He was part of the team
    for UCLA&#39;s The Aldine Press project and also helped us work out some uncertainties
    with our Gutenberg book, Black-letter. Amazing depth of knowledge. <BR> <BR>Updike&#39;s
    tome has a showing of Type 8 intermingled with Type 6 in Tretyse of Love, 1493.
    Caxton was one funky typographer. <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m up then. Think I&#39;ll
    stay way, way, away from historical stuff for a while!!! <BR> <BR>All best
