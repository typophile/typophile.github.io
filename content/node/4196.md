  body: This looks to me like the work of either Philip Bouwsma or Arthur Baker. I
    am looking for it in my Script Guide.

  body: 'I suppose this is custom designed/hand lettered. If you need a  <BR>close
    match to go with it I would suggest &#40;as Mike pointed out&#41;: <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/BAKE/F_BAKE-10005000.jhtml" target="_blank">
    Baker Signet</a> as a companion roman text face. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/mercator/"
    target="_blank"> Mercator</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/MARI/F_MARI-10005000.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Marigold</a> as a companion chancery script. <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OXFO/F_OXFO-10005000.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Oxford</a> as a companion semi-uncial. <BR> <BR>If you need a

  body: 'My own recommendations would be two of Bouwsma&#39;s calligraphic faces:
    <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5GN" target="_blank">Mantegna Italic</a>
    and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5I0" target="_blank">Polenta &#40;formerly
    Donatello&#41; Black Italic</a>. <BR> <BR>These were the closest I saw in running
    through the Calligraphic scripts in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script04Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 4 of the Script Font  ID Guide</a>. Polenta has a lighter
    weight too.'

  body: 'To all: <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help and the new resources to look at for
    identifying font faces, I thought I had seen most of them, but I&#39;m not even
    close! <BR> <BR>I will take your suggestions and see which flies with the powers
    that be, and speaking of flying, the dove does look an awful lot like the Dove
    logo...  I never noticed it before. <BR> <BR>Philip Bouwsma does good work, I
    like most of his typefaces. <BR> <BR>Thanks again'
