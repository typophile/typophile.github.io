  me ID the typeface used for the Consumer Reports masthead? I will be redesigning
  the basic layout of a mag for a design class, but one of the requirements of the
  assignment is to incorporate the current masthead. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \ first thoughts were Britsh Inserat and Compacta, because of the \"r\", but they
    are both a bit too angular.\r\n"

    starting point.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. The masthead is usually the box on the
    inside of the magazine that tells who the editorial staff is. The logo on the
    front cover is usually called the nameplate or the banner."

      It has many similaries to both, but isn't exactly either.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks
      for the lingo tips, Lex. "
