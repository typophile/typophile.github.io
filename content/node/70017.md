    the typefaces you recommended and give some serious thought to designing my own
    blackletter-ish custom lettering for the label. I'll report back.\r\n\r\n- Cheers"

    tell me: Why do you guys so often use quite funny names for your fonts? Is it
    \"cool\" to do so? I just try to understand it.\r\n\r\nBest wishes to Argentina
    from Germany.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\nPS: Is it a hand towel on your head? Ehm... sorry.
    Its only a rumor that there are no silly questions existing... ;-)\r\n"

  body: "@Bleisetzer:\r\nI didn't know of Pr\xE4gefest (now I see where ScriptMT finds
    the inspiration!).\r\nFor the Lobster, inspiration comes from many sources, as
    stated in the image at the end of the download site.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster name comes
    because the same day, just hours after starting the font, I was watching some
    TV program about how to cook lobsters and it just stick with me.\r\nAnd for the
    image, just goggled for lobster images and find that one funny.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, for keeping this post on topic.\r\nYou could try Triplett Black, set in all
    caps.\r\n"
