body: I am in the process of designing a logo and identity around a photography business.  The
  client wants to look young and modern, while alluding to early 20th century america.
  She does wedding photography and portraiture as well as boudoir/ pin-up style photography.  She
  wants to appeal to a younger clientele; mid 20's to 30's primarily without excluding
  a wider range of potential customers. I would appreciate any feedback and/or direction.  Thanks
  for your time.

  body: Hmm, before going into any details, might it not be too dainty and cheery
    and female-gender-role for a pinup photographer?
