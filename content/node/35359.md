    Nor is \u2018Sarkozette\u2019 Century 725 Condensed\u2014again, the top of the
    \u2018t\u2019 makes it quite obvious, sorry.\r\n\r\nThey both look like special

  body: "<strong><em>Curiosity:</em></strong> The Swedish newspaper \"Svenska Dagbladet\"
    was re-designed (about 2004?) by \xD6rjan Nordlings and the crew at Pangea Design
    with a little typographic help from Stefan Hattenbach (Mac Rhino) and Mark Winelid
    (Typecraft). The newspaper uses a font called SvD grotesk (with inspiration from
    Griffith and Bell) and a customized version of Poynter that's called Poynter SvD
    Os Display light and regular. You can read more about this at <a href=\"http://www.pangeadesign.se/sv/56-72-5-0/Portfolio.aspx?d=0&a=1&area=alphabetical&pos=381\">Pangea
