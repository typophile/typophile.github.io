body: Hello.  <BR> <BR>Is there anyone who has information about Normunds Hartmanis,
  Lithuanian typograph?  <BR> <BR>I have just bought a book from the year 1957 about
  the swedish iron company LKAB. The typeface used in the headlines and on the cover
  of the book is made by Normunds Hartmanis.  <BR>&#40;I dont have the name of the
  typeface.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Is he a wellknown graphic designer?  <BR>Are there any
  books about his work?  <BR>Would it be possible to find examples of typefaces that
  he constructed?  <BR> <BR>Best regards  <BR>Magdalena, Sweden

    the obvious, but try Google. I did. There is enough there to get started but not
    much in English. <BR> <BR>Gerald
