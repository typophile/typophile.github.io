  body: I like the look. It's simple, clean, balanced and well rendered.

  body: I'm not sure about the ff, its very tight, also what do you think in terms
    of legability?

  body: Yeah, you would want to experiment with raising the ascender of the first
    'f' so it has more breathing room beside (and above) the second 'f'.

  body: Will there be a color treatment?   A mark?  How do you envision it working
    on business cards, website, etc?   I think it's great, but will be made way stronger
    or weaker depending on its setting - straightforward logotypes seem to be more
    vulnerable to abusive surroundings.  ;)

  body: I Haven't really started looking at colour treatments yet trying to fine tune
    the logo, just want to keep it really clean and simple, as for the website again
    very minimal lots of white space. I'm looking at a typeface that will work with
    the logo at the moment does anything spring to mind?

  body: Your "f-e" spacing is correct but your "f's" are too far apart.

  body: "I agree that the f's are a bit too far apart now.    For the web page, a
    Grotesk-ish anti-aliased font for headlines and aliased verdana for body is how
    I'd go.  I'd also be tempted to have the page not entirely white, but with some
    dark grey as at least a partial background color.\r\n\r\nHuh, I just realized
    this logo reminds me of Veer's (which is a compliment), and that my description
    of fonts for the website is probably some unconscious mimicking of Veer."

  body: Could we see what it would look like if you made an e-f ligature and replaced
    the e-c ligature with a c-t, or combined them into a three letter cursive.

    it.
