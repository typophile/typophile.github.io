  on FontSquirrel. The resulting truetype hints look as good as they can on Windows,
  but at 13 pt and 18pt only, the overshoots on rounded glyphs render strangely. I
  haven't found a solution for this yet, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help
  me get to the bottom of this. \r\n\r\nIs it possible that the truetype hinting instructions
  are affecting rendering on OSX? I've read that hints are mostly ignored by this
  operating system in favor of something more built in, so I'm a little confused.\r\n\r\nAre
  there certain tests I should run, or is there more information that would be helpful
  in understanding the issue?\r\n\r\nImage below:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font

    every glyph exhibits this issue, note that the top horizontal strokes of the Z,
    E, F, T, all look \"thick\". I think it's just that in the case of the rounds,
    you're only seeing this effect in a more limited area, while in characters with
    vertical strokes it's just not that noticeable. \r\n\r\nBut no, TrueType instructions
    aren't causing this effect. "
