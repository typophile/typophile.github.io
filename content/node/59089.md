  body: "I was involved in that other thread. Another font in that same Image Club
    collection is Firenze which also had a similar ampersand, but neither Milano Roman
    or Firenze is an exact match.(Just looking at the font, and I see the similar
    & was an alternate glyph that seems not to be in the font that Image Club digitized.)\r\n\r\n-
