    body: On that note, why is it that major magazine publishers such as Wenner state
      in their file specs to avoid TT? If you use their DDAPv3 driver and distiller
      preset, does font type matter? Just curious.

  body: "Another way of looking at this though, is that Windows fonts are relatively
    untested on Mac OS. If a font developer is developing a \"Windows\" TrueType font,
    they may not bother testing to see if it works properly on Mac OS. This may be
    particularly true for greymarket/free fonts, which I've experienced problems with.
    In the case of legacy font files, I'm not sure there is anyone necessarily at
    fault. It may be that the font worked fine on the OS for which it was intended.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, if the font was built according to spec, it should work. However, I think
    it is perfectly rational for for a printer to want to avoid them. Licensed fonts
    from major foundries are not likely to be the problem, of course. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "A TrueType font must contain a 'cmap' table for the platform you want to
    use.  In the old days, this meant that a TrueType font that only had a Windows
    'cmap' table would not work on Mac OS and vice-versa, because without that table,
    the OS couldn't figure out how to map characters to glyphs in the font.\r\n\r\nThese
    days, almost all recent-vintage fonts have Unicode 'cmap' tables, and current
    versions of both Windows and Mac OS X know how to use them.  However, older programs
    may not react well to fonts that are missing the 'cmap' for your particular text
    encoding.  In general, though, if it <em>looks</em> like the font is working,
    it's working.  Just keep these things in mind (for example, if you send a job
    using such a font out for printing, then if the printer is using an older OS or
    older version of the program, you may run into difficulties).\r\n\r\n"

    any of them to see if they were kidding (probably not a wise idea). If you outline
    them how are they going to know? Do True Type fonts have hinting? If not, convert
    to outlines and be done with it\u2026\r\npeace"

    after TrueType 1.0, people don't realize that it has far more powerful hinting
    capabilities than Type 1.\r\n\r\n(All of which work completely on any PostScript
    3 printer, and on many Level 2 devices as well.)"

  body: "If there's hinting, then outlines of small sizes is not a very good idea.
    But I just wouldn't start sending them to mags whose specs say not to use them.
    I never use True Type for this reason. Of course I don't use Type 1 much anymore
    either\u2026\r\npeace"
