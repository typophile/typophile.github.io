Does it have anything to do with 12 points per pica, six picas per inch? Or is it a myth?  <BR> <BR>A colleague claims that Web graphics must be saved at 72 DPI. But in my experience, only pixels matter, unless you want more work for yourself.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, the assertion that mac screens are 72dpi is also not <i>quite</i> correct either. The operating system renders type at a nominal resolution of 72dpi, but how its actually displayed on a particular monitor is up to the monitor&#39;s size and pixel resolution.  <BR> <BR>Its an easy thing to prove too - just set your monitor&#39;s resolution to a different one than it is currently working at and the actual resolution of it in DPI will change, but the nominal resolution that the OS is drawing graphics at will remain at 72dpi on a mac or 96dpi &#40;or whatever&#41; on a Windows box. <BR> <BR>DPI is, as fellow hairyface Thomas said, irrelevant. <BR> <BR>PS: I work in television and I spend at least 2 hours a week explaining screen resolution to people who think they can take a DVD menu stripped of its navigation and shove it on a poster 5 foot high. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the feedback, all.  <BR> <BR>I held a ruler to my Mac display and got about 105-110dpi. Toning it down to 1024x768, I got it to 90-95dpi. Nothing came close to 72. Oddly, my 15&#34; Windows monitor at 800x600 was about 70-75dpi; at 1024x768 it was about 90-95. I imagine my classroom&#39;s projector would yield a larger dpi, since it stretches 800x600 pixels four feet wide. <BR> <BR>But in all cases, the same 100 square pixel graphic remained 100 square pixels. Next time someone asks, maybe I&#39;ll underscore the pixel dimensions -- but ask for 1 dpi just to see how they react. <BR> <BR>But does 72dpi have anything to do with 72 points in an inch, as in 12 points to a pica?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The orignal macs were 72 ppi &#40;pixels per inch&#41;. The original laserwriters were 144 dpi. Twice that of the screen.

		<div class="commentbody">Here&#39;s one good reason: It makes it easier to do the math.  <BR> <BR>72 has a lot of numbers which can be divided into it evenly:  <BR>2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36. Notice anything  <BR>interesting about those numbers? Most of them are  <BR>standard type sizes. It made it easy to figure out how many  <BR>lines fit into an inch with standard type sizes. Even better,  <BR>many of the standard sizes divide evenly into one another  <BR>by a factor of 2 or 3. Some standard type sizes are odd &#40;10,  <BR>11, 14, 30, 60&#41; or only come out even every 2 inches &#40;48&#41;,  <BR>but not as many as there would be if a different number  <BR>had been chosen. <BR> <BR>Try doing the same thing with 50, 75, or 100. With 50 you  <BR>get 2, 5, 10, and 25. 75 gets you 3, 5, 15, and 25. 100 gets  <BR>you 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50.  <BR> <BR>Since we use computers to do all our math now, convenient  <BR>numbers like 72 are little more than historical habits, but  <BR>it&#39;s not hard to see why they were chosen in the metal type  <BR>days.</div>

Even for book design -- in which you might point to the fact that pages are portrait -- it is much more useful to see a spread than to see an individual page. Even for tall, narrow folded pieces like brochures, what you really want to see is how it looks when unfolded, not the individual panels.

		<div class="commentbody">To go WAY back to the original question: why are web graphics typically rendered at 72dpi? One reason: bandwidth. <BR> <BR>As has been covered, web  graphics are handled in pixels, so the DPI is fairly irrlelvant as to the visual size of the image when it&#39;s displayed on the web. However,if you choose to render your web graphics at 300spi just &#34;because&#34;, you are doing your visitors a disservice, as the graphic will take considerably longer to load.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From what I&#39;ve seen, resizing the images doesn&#39;t affect it, but resampling it does. Aside from compression, the number of pixels involved &#40;resampling&#41; determines file size, not how many dots per inch &#40;resizing&#41;. <BR> <BR>I saved the same image at 72dpi, 300dpi and 1000 dpi &#40;resampling off in Photoshop to keep them at 100x100 pixels each&#41;. Each file was 884 bytes. Resampled to 200x200 pixels, the 72dpi image was 1,599 bytes. <BR> <BR>So I gather that pixels are information &#40;bytes on disk&#41;, and dpi is how large the pixels are -- in print.</div>
