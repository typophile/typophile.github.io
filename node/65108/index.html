  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">What is everyone's stance on the super-heavy, modular, geometric trend that's coming from various design boutiques these days? I'm talking stuff that you'd see featured every now and then on <a href="http://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>, and in the work of  <a href="http://www.non-format.com/showcase/milky-disco-2/1/">Non-Format</a>. 

Usually letters are deconstructed into basic shapes or pure line, then modularly designed, edging the border of legibility. I've seen it referred as type and typography countless times, but in my opinion it's more along the lines of display lettering. I guess that sorta counst as type right? Is this artistic style a welcome departure from traditional typography, or is it in danger of hijacking the definition of what "type" is?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I don't have any plans to design a type in this genre.

Type genre has nothing to do with whether something is type or lettering.

The lines between type and lettering have become blurred by OpenType alternates.
When it's possible to set a wordmark or headline with a font that has lots of alternate glyphs to chose from, including swashes, and do so either by selecting from a glyph palette, or going with the contextual substitutions built-in to the font, then the process of typographic design is more like that of lettering.

This isn't really new. The famous Photo-Lettering Inc. was a type house (mid 20th century).
They'd work from film-strip fonts, and then modify details of a setting by hand, e.g. making ligatures.
So was that type or lettering?

Duchamp would have called it an assisted readymade.

Real display lettering is distinguished by the possibility that you might get your hands dirty--but so is real typesetting.

Just suppose my view of display type is a vast palette, yet specific form of expression, each face satisfying very individual, and idiosyncratic  needs whereas text faces serve the "greater good," immersive reading, and thereby in my opinion are very banal. So why do you dislike, or eschew faces that are personality driven. Not that there is anything wrong with liking text faces.

		<div class="commentbody">I could write a short book on this; but for now, a short paragraph:
To me display faces are too superficial, too predictable. Because display faces pander to our conscious -and transient- tastes, making a successful display face involves only moderate skill, and only one notable talent: discerning what will be fashionable in the immediate future. Success in display face design is also largely a matter of luck - which to me is a turn-off. In contrast, making a good text face requires grasping and balancing so many subtleties, and having such a command of spacing and texture, that it takes my breath away. A text face reflects the personalities of billions of people, over centuries.

I thought I had, in the first post.
More plainly: <strong>if a setting is made from a font, it's typography.</strong>
Therefore the trend you are identifying as "display lettering" is nothing of the sort.
In fact, as the individual glyphs in this genre are emphatically discrete, with no extrusions subject to ligation, this genre is "lettering-proof", as there is no opportunity to hand-nuance joins. (Sorry Ricardo, nice s_t lig, but the face, dark though it is, doesn't belong to the genre in question.)

If other people are already as sketchy about the difference between type and lettering as you seem to be, this new trend won't make any difference to the definition of "what type is" :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like that Pentagram logo a lot, especially the way all the elements align vertically, the way the "color" of the piece is distributed in both x and y directions, and the way the "l" in Carolina drives the overall arrangement.
By making the "counter" space equal the letter space, this style achieves a kind of monowidth effect, yet with narrow "i" and "l".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ecs, you hit it right on the money. The point is, that genre of illegible letter illustration I'm referring to is being <strong>called</strong> typography/type design, and that's what bothers me. Quite the opposite of the good, heavy fonts that actually have finesse. While we're on heavy stuff, care to take a gander at <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/65018">what I'm working on</a>?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My disappointment with Pentagram's North Carolina Museum logo is perhaps because I was already dismayed by their Museum of Art and Design logo. ([http://www.madmuseum.org/])

In presenting the process of the latter at a recent AIGA event, Michael Bierut flippantly and openly admitted that the creation of the letterforms by using a circle and square was less an idea and more about a formal quality that has been exhaustively "explored" for the better part of a hundred years.

These were early Bauhaus experiments; we should stop calling them fresh. The Weimar designers in the 1920s and 30s moved on, and so should we.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm Hrant - "the real thing." Not sure what this is, but I think from the drift of the conversations that "the real thing" is text type as opposed to display lettering or type, whichever you prefer. Is text type hard to design? Yes, very. Is display type hard to design? Well in my opinion, yes. Good design is just that, good design, and bad design is bad design. Display type serves a purpose and if the purpose is served by the new trend in very heavy, at times difficult to read types, so be it. If one could find a generalization about this it is that display type is very much dependent on fashion or the fashion of the moment, while text type rarely falls in line with this. Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon, Bodoni, Fairfield, and others are as much in use today as text type as they ever were. The images presented here by Nick S and Eliason are examples which make my point re display as a statement about the fashion or design trends of the times. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">These Michael Bierut designs are logos rather than typefaces, and don't have to be highly legible. Looked at as logos, I think they are pretty good, though perhaps a bit stale because of the Bauhaus echoes. 

I think it is really hard to bring off the super heavy style without looking awkward, but Dez Squeeze does it awesomely.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jordon, actually by "real thing" I meant type designers.
Graphic designers tend to only see the surface of fonts.

William, my issue isn't with legibility, it's with respect.
Not towards people who make type, but type itself.
