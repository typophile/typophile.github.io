body: I think I am aware of most English language type foundries, but I was wondering
  what foundries in other countries are doing... <BR> <BR>I am especially thinking
  that the french are bound to have loads of foundries and that they are unlikely
  to be in English. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>===
