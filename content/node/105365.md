    do the job for all otf font files in the current directory and subdirectories.
    If that is not fast enough (due to one call to fontforge for each file) you can
    reduce the number of calls to one reusing some code of http://fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html"

  body: I just tried on a MacBook Air with no programmer tool installed (no X code),
    just XQuartz and github FontForge and applications from the mac store. The input
    was 486 western fonts from Adobe Type Classics (something of about 10 years ago).
    It took about 2 minutes to generate the ufo, but FontForge would not process back
    some of the UFO files, telling it could not process the features in the ufo and
    scrapping them.

    Here is the answer I had prepared for your post.\r\n\r\n----\r\nHere is a trace
    searching for a particular problem in the .fea files that were generated\r\n<PRE>\r\n
    find . -name \"*.fea\" -exec grep 'by[ ]*;' {} \\; | sort | uniq -c\r\n 102        sub
    [\\uniF661 ]' [\\slash \\fraction \\uni2215 ]' [\\uniF661 ]'  by ;\r\n  12        sub
    [\\uniF661 ]' [\\slash \\fraction ]' [\\uniF661 ]'  by ;\r\n 128        sub [\\zero
    ]' [\\slash \\fraction ]' [\\zero ]'  by ;\r\n</PRE>\r\nThis found all feature
    files and searched in them for lines where 'by ;' is written. There is a total
    of 102 + 12 +128 =242 lines. Those are the 242 lines that cause the problem with
    the 242 ufo files. \r\n\r\nAfter executing \r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nfind . -name \"*.fea\"
    -exec sed -i .orig '/by[ ]*;/d' {} \\;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nto remove those lines,
    FontForge accepted the ufo files as input without scrapping the features."
