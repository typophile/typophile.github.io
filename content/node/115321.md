  body: "From a more complete printout you posted earlier (very small) my guess is
    that the font is EPSON \u6559\u79D1\u66F8\u4F53\uFF2D, pronounced kyoukasho tai
    M; cf the thread http://typophile.com/node/101931.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Epson Kyokasho has narrow characters in the ASCII range and the corresponding
    normal characters in the range uniFF01 to uniFF5D.\r\n\r\nIf I extrapolate the
    digits in the two ranges by  160%, if I interpolate the uppercase characters by
    50% and if I use the lowercase in the 0xFF31-0xFF5A range (except for m and w)
    I get the following, which is pretty close to your sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ThomasRenaut_6144.png]\r\n\r\nI
    could not find the EULA. The font can be extracted with unzip from an exe file
    found on the EPSON site http://www.epson.jp/download2/printer/driver/win/page/ttf30.htm
    which is all in Japanese."

  body: "If, like me, you never run exe files except from very trusted sources, you
    can use a procedure for applying WinRAR to extract the fonts without running the
    exe, as described by \"Sham\" in the Yahoo answer at https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130523231027AAy7WJb\r\nWorked
    perfectly for me on the exe mentioned by Michael.\r\nNow to see if I can replicate
    his extrapolation & interpolation result :)\r\nDon"
