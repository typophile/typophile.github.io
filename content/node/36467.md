  spacing of Herb Lubalin:\r\n\r\nFirst. I'm an admirer of the work of Herb Lubalin
  but I can't find a book with writings and samples of his work. \xBFWhat could you
  recommend?\r\n\r\nSecond. I don't know how to handle the finer aspects of type spacing
  such as kerning heads, spacing punctuation marks or using the hair, thin, third,
  quarter, n and m spaces. \xBFIs there a book on the topic?\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor\r\n"

    to get your hands on a copy you\u2019ll need to either spend $100+ for it or find
    it in a library. You might want to check around with the design firms in Mexico
    City\u2014the book was never that hard to come by when it was in print (it mostly
    sells for so much because used book dealer are being morons), so it\u2019s a pretty
    common item in any older design library."

  body: "I always felt Herb Lubalin was set free on his spacing from the 1950s and
    the start up of the typositor. That was freedom from lead type. It allowed creative
    folks to place their letters where they wanted to - without using the knife.\r\n\r\nI
    knew many designers from that era - and can even remember a few late night discussions
    of \"letterspace tighter -- tighter -- tighter...\" *\r\n\r\n*It wasn't called
    \"kerning\" back then - "

  body: "Yes, there is overlap between 'Finer Points' and 'Elements'--I'm sure Bringhurst
    knows Dowdling. Also I think Dowdling I think overdoes it on the tightness of
    word spacing. --The main point of the book is to combat overly loose word spacing,
    which was apparently common in the metal Linotype days, when the book was written.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, it does go into more detail on a number of issues. It's a nice
    book, but not a 'must'. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, [[http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=92771&d_currency=|Book
    Typography]] by Mitchell & Wightman is excellent and quite comprehensive on type
    setting for book design. It's a bit expensive, but does cover everything that
    Dowdling does, I think, and a lot more. "
