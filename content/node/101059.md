body: "Hey guys,\r\nthis is my very first attempt at a fully custom logotype. any
  feedback on the typeface would be awesome.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nthe client is looking
  for something \"fresh, adaptable, and clean\" ; I feel a wide-set humanist sans-serif
  balances well with the classical themes evoked by the graphics floral theme and
  circular shape (based on a Kamon), but with no formal training in type design, only
  a ferocious interest, I want to to my best to ensure that it can stand up to the
  critical eyes of the most well trained type-designers, and so I arrive here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
  major concerns lie with the 'm' 'o' and 'r': specifically, the join at the center
  of the 'm', the \"angle\" of the 'o' and the terminal angle of the 'r'"

  body: "The font seems to fight with the artwork. The uniform stroke weight and sharp
    edges are at odds with the graceful lines of the drawing, and the elliptical shapes
    of the <strong>a</strong> and <strong>e</strong> are jarring below the round shape.
    I would use something softer, with a bit of variation in the stroke weight and
    flared or rounded stroke ends. Maybe something with a little of the Art Nouveau/Art
    Deco feel of the artwork.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I am a Goudy disciple when it comes
    to letterspacing lowercase, but <em>chacun \xE0 son go\xFBt</em>."

  body: "Thanks for the rapid reply Mojo,\r\nWhile the input on stroke weight and
    collision of shapes are appreciated for their pinpoint accuracy (I'll try to soften
    it up a bit and get back to you all), I personally don't know of any Goudy fonts
    that fall into the \"contemporary, fresh and modern\" category.\r\nIt's important
    to me to contrast the softness and grace of the logo with a bit of modernist or
    contemporary freshness so that the branding from then forward can aspire toward
    something fresh (apologies for the lack of a less buzzy). My hope was to use an
    updated version of early 20th century wide-set gothics (i was thinking a thin-weight
    extended-width Gotham, or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/sans-pro/|Sweet
    Sans Pro]]), and the packaging will eventually lean towards a Japanese aesthetic.\r\n\r\nthat
    said, if you've got a font recommendation to save me from myself, I'd be quite
    thankful.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nNathan"

  body: "It's a lovely illustrated mark. I think the issues I see first have to do
    with the composition and balance more than typeface, although I agree with the
    above comment. The text is too small and flat for the mark, and being below it
    is not helping the balance because it makes the mark seem heavy and overpowering.
    I would try to set the text to the right and make it a lot larger. Maybe explore
    some small decorative terminals like http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/pluto/
    or http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/mandevilla/\r\n\r\nLovely start
    with that great mark!"

  body: I pretty much agree with the comments above. I might try reversing the image
    so the flower is facing right (since we read left to right, images that face left
    like the flower does can subtly seem to be pointing backwards).
