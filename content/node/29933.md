  body: ICK! There are a million nicer and more legible handwriting fonts than this.
    I recommend you find something else.

  body: Yes, those connections are unbecoming. Consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=UR.116439.0.0">Vladimir
    Script</a> (connected cursive) or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.107035.0.0">Longhand</a>
    (print) instead.

  body: "I think the comments make it clear that this is an amateur font, made from
    someone's writing, with no attempt to make the connections join. With hand printing,
    at least you get something that looks like printing on paper. With a script font
    made this way, you get nothing that even barely resembles real handwriting. \r\n\r\nThere
    are much better script handwriting fonts. See <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg1.html\">Part
    9 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> for some samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    doesn't appear to be an option on this occasion. \r\n\r\nIt is carers, not careers
    - the subject is people with a disability.\r\n\r\nGreat resource Mike, thank you
    for the link.\r\n\r\nBrisa is beautiful Alejandro, as is your other work. I'm
    drawn to Whomp, in particular.\r\n\r\nIf I find a match, I'll let you all know

    I hope you didn't mind us voicing our opinion. We believe this Board can have

    I hope you find it in time."
