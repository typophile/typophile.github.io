  know I should have used a fifth tint for those grey texts, but it was out budget.\r\n\r\nNow
  I must admin the result is not great. \r\nWhen printed, the grey is dotted, and
  body copy (printed in grey) is not really clean.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the client
  made a mistake somewhere so the job will be re-printed. \r\n\r\nI still don't have
  the budget for a fifth, but I need to get something less crispy, so I'd like to
  print with a real CMYK grey.\r\n\r\nIllustrator gives me : C:52 M:44 Y:41 K:7\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think ?"

  body: Any time you are mixing inks, text will always be a little fuzzy (filled with
    dots). The only way to get truly crisp grey type is to use a spot grey ink. Otherwise
    I would suggest using 100% black with no other ink colors mixed in. Registration
    always bites beautiful screen type.

  body: "Don't use stochastic raster, it will cause more problems than solutions.
    Today the normal amplitude modulated rasters are so fine that frequency modulated
    (stochastic) raster is not really relevant any more.\r\n\r\nIf you use a raster
    value in body copy then use only the black plate in your case. That way the print
    will look cleaner because there can't be any out-of-register that will make it
    look fuzzy. Just set K=69% for the best result. Have the platemaker (assuming
    the printer goes CTP) rasterize in 200 lines pr. inch."

  body: "totally agree with RedMonolith... After having tried to use multiple plates
    on small body text in the past, with several printers, I now avoid it at all costs...
    It's just not worth the risk of getting a job which is even slightly mis-registered
    - and most printers won't guarantee that kind of accuracy without a premium.\r\n\r\nI
    would ask if your printer can create the seperations using a higher screen density,
    so you can just use K only, and get finer results."

    \"Phantom\" from the 1830s.\r\nVarious other shaded and ruled faces in the past.\r\nAnd
    there's that LettError bankish face that has size-specific pseudo-engraved ruled
    tone fill.\r\nBut I think Figgins had the right idea, that the rules can be structural,
    not just applied tone.\r\nSome of those op art faces, eg Pump, and Mexico Olympics,
    have ruled structure that gives them a tonal value.\r\nBut those are all display
    faces.\r\nHowever, I don't see why a text type couldn't be developed, for this
    high-res era, that has some built-in tonal quality.\r\nFor that matter, it may
    be possible to use an outlined Thin weight at text size, but it would require
    some experimentation to get the effect just so.\r\n"
