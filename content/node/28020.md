  the apartment of a shoe designer, and check out what's right over her fireplace
  and essentially front and center on the mag's cover: a Village Type 'For Like Ever'
  poster. All you TypeCon '05 attendees are now even hipper...or something.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/domino_village_3565.jpg]\r\n\r\nAh,
  I see that <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/products/Village/Villageposter_limited/\">Village
  has taken notice, as well</a>."

  body: "we village members got this email yesterday from t & c:\r\n\r\n<em>Well friends,
    we find ourselves on the receiving end of a great deal of attention thanks to
    \u201CDomino\u201D magazine. http://www.dominomag.com/\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar
    with Domino, it is a homewares magazine which is quite popular, and has a large
    and devoted readership. In the September issue of the magazine our launch poster
    was shown in the apartment of rising star fashion designer Jessie Randall.\r\n\r\nAs
    a result of this appearance there has been a veritable flood of orders for the
    poster. We had to go back on-press twice with the \u201CFor Like Ever\u201D graphic
    in order to satisfy the demand. (While we were at it, we decided to go for super-high
    production values, and had the poster silkscreened on heavy archival stock.)\r\n\r\nSo,
    the month of August was pretty much 90% poster-rolling and mailing tube stuffing,
    taping, and labeling. We got a postage meter and filled our little apartment with
    big boxes of mailing tubes.\r\n\r\nWe thought that you\u2019d be amused and/or
    interested. And some of you might have wondered why we\u2019ve been so quiet lately.
    It was because we were up to our eyeballs with posters and mailing tubes.\r\n\r\nWith
    best wishes for a great autumn from us,\r\nTracy & chester</em>"

    however, that it strikes me as an odd selling-point to print a poster on archival
    paper with fugitive fluorescent ink. But, what the heck . . .\r\n\r\n-- K."
