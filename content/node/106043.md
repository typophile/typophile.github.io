  and i need the right font for the quote that i will have on me.\r\n\r\nThe quote
  is from 1912, from Captain Oates, His supposed last words, and i'm looking for a
  font to really capture the quote. A font accurate to the period, but also something
  that resembles a Diary Entry? Something handwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice you could
  give would be greatly appreciated, the font really needs to fit the quote.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much."

    have you searched for images of Oates' letter to see what his handwriting looks
    like?\r\n\r\nMaybe Voyage would work for you:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/voyage/"

    though Voyage is, it is a popular style now that may look dated in a few years.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an item from my grandmother\u2019s autograph book; I believe it is a man\u2019s
    hand.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thin_4218.png]\r\n\r\nA handwriting
    font like <a href=\"http://www.g-type.com/olicana-font\">Olicana</a> would be
    closer to your speci\uFB01cation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I would take a look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/azalea-smooth/regular/\">Azalea</a>.\r\n\r\nWhile
    the story of Oates' futile sacrifice is moving, I think I'd be more inclined to
    a quote from Shackleton, who brought all his men home alive: \"Superhuman effort
    isn't worth a damn unless it achieves results.\""

    body: "The quote has two main links to me, one, it is what inspired me to travel
      (The quote is included in a travel tattoo), and secondly, the story of Captain
      Oates was told to me by my father, who has designed the tat. \r\n\r\nThanks
      for all the suggestions guys, i'll take a look at them all and have a think"
