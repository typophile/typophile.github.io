  makeup, without being directly makeup related. So no 'shadow' or 'powder' or 'kohl'\r\nI
  am struggling with this. It can be made-up or a blend. Oye."

    ended up going with 'glossa.' \r\n\r\nIf you ever leave another comment on one
    of my posts, I promise to respond in a more timely manner. 2 years or less. Promise."

  body: "The word \"mascara\" comes from the Arabic \"maskhara\", which loosely translated
    means \"made with poop\". So it's good you didn't use that.  :->\r\n\r\nI think
    \"Glossa\" is good. It's pretty hard to allude to make-up in a gender neutral
    way. But I have to wonder: when does that make sense? Maybe in showbiz?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    old posts!\r\n\r\nI just hope it's not a typeface name, because there is already
    a <a href=\"http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/glosa/\">Glosa</a>."
