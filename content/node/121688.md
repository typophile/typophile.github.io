body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nI want to download the Microsoft VTT tool, but I can't
  figure out how is it possible! \r\nRight here, on [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx]]
  it tells that I must <em>fax</em> them a copy of a signed agreement. First of all,
  come on, <em>fax</em> in 2014? And also the link to that agreement doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI've
  googled for it and couldn't find any solutions. I've seen some links to it on the
  FontLab forum, but they also do not work.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know how to get Microsoft
  VTT?"

    You email them a scan and they fax it for you. The link to the license agreement
    works fine for me.
