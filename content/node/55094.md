body: "In the area where I live there is a store that has a sign with a typeface I
  can't for the life of me figure out. I'm pretty sure the sign was created in the
  70s or 80s. The closest typeface I can find is Stop (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stop/)
  but it doesn't have lowercase letters. Maybe a non-digital version did? I'm not
  sure.\r\n\r\nI always just noticed yesterday it was used on the cover of the Atari
  game Space Jockey.\r\n"

  body: It's an old Letraset face called Motter Tektura, designed by Othmar Motter
    around 1974. The only digital version appears to be <a href="http://www.free-fonts-ttf.org/true-type-fonts/motter-tektura-cyrilic-2435-download.htm">Motter
    Tektura Cyrilic</a>. The digitization is poor, but it's free. Motter Tektura was
    also the face used for the original Apple logo (not counting that drawing of Newton
    they used briefly).

  body: Actually, there is a better (commercial) version from <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Motter-Tektura.htm">ParaType</a>,
    also, curiously, made for cyrillic.

  body: Awesome! Thanks so much Mark. You've got a keen eye. I was thinking it might
    have been a Letraset face but it's interesting to see there's a digital version
    as well.
