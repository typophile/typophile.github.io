  body: "An almost identical A -- with the angled cross stroke -- is found in F. W.
    Goudy's National Old Style and Nabisco fonts of 1916 and 1921. \r\nNational:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoudyHalfCentOfTypeV1p99NationalOSCharset_6105.jpg]\r\nNabisco:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoudyHalfCentOfTypeV1p119Nabisco_5013.jpg]\r\nNational
    Old Style is available as a \"prop font,\" i.e. an unedited  autotrace from HPLHS
    [A Lovecraft fan and gaming  group]\r\nhttp://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html\r\nNational
    is shown in detail at pages 300 to 305 of the ATF Catalog for 1923. Luc Devroye
    has an informative page \r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-26299.html\r\nThe distinctive
    leg on the R is very similar to the one on Nicolas Jenson\u2019s Roman.

  body: "You're welcome Oliver. Many of F.W. Goudy's fonts have already been digitized.
    It's just a question of when, not if for this one. Interesting to see who gets
    there first.\r\ndon"
