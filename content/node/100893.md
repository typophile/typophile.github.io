body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt to get competent critique about
  my font. So please, Don\u2019t beat me up too hard :)  \r\nI will be very appreciated
  about any critics and comments.\r\nMy first serif typeface I am trying to make a
  little bit retro, fashy, but contemporary. \r\nIt has 5 different serif shapes depending
  on the position of prominent parts of letters (maybe a little bit too complicated,
  but I like it). \r\nI know there are still many things to work on and improve, but
  the main parts I am really not sure about are sharp ends of stems. The stems are
  the only parts without any serifs and I guess it makes the whole face unusual.\r\nPlease
  look at PDF files attached below. \r\nI made the stems a little bit out of the baseline
  to prevent them to look shorter than next letters, but I think it still looks wired
  at large points. At sample \"i\" looks longer than next \"l\" and so on.. . May
  be I made them too sharp or too long? Is there any way to do not change the shape?
  Or may be I need to make the bottom parts of letters more consequent? Or it is Okay?
  \r\nI need your opinions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and responce!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Half_Serif_3_sm_4955.jpg]"
