  body: I really like the second color, a lot. i am not sure about the echo effect
    as it seems to muddy the clarity of the original mark.

  body: "The Echo of the logo  looks neat on screen but when you go to print it is
    gonna blur like crazy unless you have an incredible line screen. I would go with
    Tif's advice or do something different.\r\n\r\nWhat about the logo centered on
    the front & the info ( Co. name etc) on the back? Simpler could be stronger."

    on coated? Does the client have the ability to print on coated paper? That's something
    you should definitely find out.\r\n\r\nJoseph Szala\r\nVigor Graphic Design, LLC.\r\nwww.vigorgraphics.net\r\n\r\n"
