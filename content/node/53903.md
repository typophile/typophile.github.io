  pretty sure New Orleans is actually one of the oldest cities in the United States
  which I think is noticeable in its type.  After collecting several pictures of type
  around New Orleans I realized how the history of the city gives it it's uniqueness.
  \ In all three pictures above, the architecture combined with the type reminds me
  of Europe which isn't usual to see in the Unites States. The typefaces in the U.S.
  I think we usually come across are more bold, legible and san serif typefaces which
  you can also see around New Orleans but are not as interesting to admire.  "
