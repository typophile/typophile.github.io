  Mac OS X and Windows is available for (free) download via the following links:\r\n\r\nMac
  OS X: http://www.fontmaster.nl/Downloads/CPMA/Version_130/Mac/DTL%20CompareMaster%201.3.0.zip\r\nWindows:
  http://www.fontmaster.nl/Downloads/CPMA/Version_130/Windows/DTL%20CompareMaster%201.3.0.zip\r\n\r\nCurrently
  DTL CompareMaster compares PostScript Type1 fonts; OpenType CFF support is planned
  for version 1.4.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFM
  in a 'bottle'\r\n\r\nFor some time now internally at DTL the Windows versions of
  FM also run in CrossOver 'Wine botlles' under X11 (support is built-in in CrossOver)
  and Linux (the latter mostly for testing). It is a very stable and reliable environment
  and surprisingly fast. Free CrossOver trial versions (or the inexpensive Standard
  versions) can be obtained from the CodeWeavers web site. \r\n\r\nMore information
  on this and on how to install FM Light in a 'bottle' can be found in the 'FM_Bottle_Kit'
  on the following download page:\r\nhttp://www.fontmaster.nl/english/demo.html\r\n\r\nA
  FM update will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nFrank E. Blokland\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FM_bottled_3750.gif]"
