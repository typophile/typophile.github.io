  body: If you can't see your color swatches, pull down from the menu and have them
    appear as a pallet in your workspace. Click on the Color tab. When it opens, click
    on the square in the upper left corner, and the Color Picker will appear. To get
    PMS colors, click on the Custom button. Select your object and apply the color
    to it, then save the color as a new swatch.

    colour.

  body: "thank you for the reply everybody,\r\n\r\n@bruce\r\n\r\ni'm using illustr.
    CS3 but the weird thing is that when i click on the squar in the upper left corner
    of the color tab, indeed the color picker appears but there is no \"custom\" button/function
    there.\r\n\r\nonly option i got in the color picker is to click \"color swatches\"...am
    i missing something ?\r\n\r\n@clauses, thnx for that info, i had no idea the X2
    was for printing twice with the same color...you live and learn, thnx\r\n\r\n"

    (the variant you want, coated, uncoated, etc.)
