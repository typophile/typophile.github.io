body: I'm collaborating with a colleague on a book regarding a recent showing of young
  chicago type designers. I was wondering if anyone could help me out with a list
  of type designers who have lived or worked in the Chicago area. Or used Chicago
  as inspiration (I'm sure someone will say the font, Chicago, so lemme have it).
  We're looking to stay authentic in the tone and message and would like to remain
  true to Chicago type roots. Old and new would be wonderful...

  body: I think both Fred Goudy and Oz Cooper lived and worked in Chicago for at least
    part of their careers. Cooper, if I recall correctly, was deeply connected to
    the sign writing tradition in Chicago. Sorry I'm so sketchy on details; maybe
    I'm remembering some about Cooper's biography from <a href=http://www.veer.com/ideas/btt/>"Behind
    the Typeface"</a> :-)

  body: "Thanks so much guys. This a great start. We're actually working with rick,
    who spoke at our event, to do a few spreads. (In case any were wondering, the
    event is here http://tinyurl.com/yj7csp9) as well as Jeremiah Chiu from Plural.
    The newer community we definitely have covered, although some of those names are
    a surprise to me! It's the years farther back that is harder to figure out but
    this is a great start, and again, thank you. \r\n\r\njackson, I was sad when Silas
    pulled out of here. His studio was right around the corner from my place and I
    never had the chance to bump into him. Although came close as I think he was invited
    to teach a type class at the same portfolio school I'm doing a class at."
