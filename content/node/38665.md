  Design is a Brazilian typefoundry interested in typographical research and revivals
  of all forms of ancient typefaces and handwriting styles. It searches historical
  churches, museums and similar institutions to develop handwriting and other fonts
  from old documents. This kind of research is not common in Brazil. In addition,
  its design team also works to create new and modern typefaces for all applications.\"\r\n\r\nSamples
