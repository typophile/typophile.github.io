  body: Joe&#39;s answer is on the right track, but possibly misleading &#40;sorry
    Joe, I think you&#39;re thinking of Fontographer :-&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The inner
    path and the outer path need to be going in different directions. There should
    be a small gray arrow along each path indicating the direction of the path. If
    they are going in the same direction, they will both be solid. You need to change
    the direction of one of them by selecting the path and right-clicking or control-clicking
    to get the contextual pop-up menu. Select &#34;Reverse contours&#34; from the
    menu. <BR> <BR>Paths within paths always need to go in opposite directions. For
    every path inside another path, you need to reverse the direction again &#40;for
    instance for an O with a dot in the middle&#41;. <BR> <BR>The direction of the
    outer path depends on what kind of font it will be. For PostScript, use counter-clockwise
    for the outer path. For TrueType, use clockwise.
