body: I need to change a jpeg a client sent us into a vector but they never mentioned
  which font was being used for the text. Is there anyone who can help me find out
  which font this is? I've tried several font identification websites with no luck.
  Please see the attached image. Thank you all![img:sites/default/files/old-images/INPAC_lower
