body: "Oops.In 1997 I released a revival of the Watts face used in a 19th-century
  bible, under the name \"Acaill\". I'm about to release a new version of this, but
  I'm thinking about changing the name. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because \"Acaill\" is a rather
  quirky Gaelic font and since its name is at the beginning of the alphabet, it loads
  before other more standard fonts, and I often get an Acaill glyph (say in a Wikipedia
  article) when I'd rather something more mainstream. \r\n\r\nIs it kosher to re-name
  a released font, and to retire the old name? "

    behavior? Sort order seems a strange way for font fallback to work."

  body: "Mac OS, various browsers. The characters in question are rare, and recently
    encoded, and are not part of any shipping core fonts. So the OS has to find a
    glyph to display them with, and it polls the installed fonts in alphabetical order
    until it finds one.\r\n\r\nHow else should the OS find a glyph that's not in the
    core or fallback fonts?"

  body: "I renamed Walbaum News to Walburn (a made-up name), for several reasons.\r\nFirstly,
    the name field was getting a bit crowded when \"Display Bold italic\" was added.\r\nSecondly,
    I wasn't comfortable that it was a genuine Walbaum, considering the liberties
    I'd taken with it.\r\nThirdly, there were quite a few other Walbaums out there.\r\n\r\nThe
    original Beaufort was renamed Beaufort Old Style when I released the new, improved
    version.\r\nThen I withdrew it."

    suppose if it doesn't know about the code point then alphabetic order is understandable,
    but maybe should take panose values into account to say pick a font similar in
    design to the CSS \"sans-serif\" default (in the case of wikipedia).\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "You could rename it EVRTP Acaill ;-)\r\nJust joking, I don\u2019t really
    like the various foundries\u2019 suffixes. But I see plenty of renamed fonts,
    for one reason or another (sure yours is a peculiar one ;-)\r\nOne that comes
    to mind is Yanone Kaffeesats, renamed Kava when it went \u201Cpro\u201C."

  body: You should also make a font called Aaaarghversion that's a pirate version
    (hence the name) of the Mac OS default CSS sans font that includes the obscure
    codepoints.
