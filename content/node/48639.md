    did one for chank that would come close:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?page=40\r\n\r\n(note
    I didn't DESIGN the typeface...it's just a quick and dirty trace of wood type
    we had...)"

  body: "Not sure it would need to have been a wood type, since there was plenty of
    film type available in the 60's. If you look through the Photo-Lettering catalogs
    there are sans serifs of every weight and width. Of course finding the exact type
    in digital form is pretty hit-and-miss, but I would think you could find some
    fonts that would let you fake this pretty easily.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
