  body: "This font is GE SS Two, in light and regular weights\r\nhttp://www.boutrosfonts.com/spip.php?article31
    \r\n\r\nI have a similar design, AwanZaman, which I believe avoids some of the
    awkward letter shapes in this typeface. \r\nhttp://www.sakkal.com/type/awan/awan_newspaper_typeface.html\r\n\r\nJuliet
    Shen just completed a compatible Latin design which we plan to release in the
    near future as one combined font family with 7 weights in normal width and 7 weights
    in condensed."
