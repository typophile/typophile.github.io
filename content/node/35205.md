  \ I would appreciate suggestions.\r\n\r\n\"poco\" is a musical term (italian) meaning
  \"little\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI emphasized this trait because I am small, and also the aspect
  of the spiritual.  I design a lot of small websites, nonprofit, blogs, and church
  sites.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pococreative_3911.png]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\n"

    very clear.\r\n3. What is shooting out of the angel's hands?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    Poco might have a negative meaning for your company name? Little Creative...hmmm.
    In a second thought it also is quite interesting. Kinda like the david and goliath
    idea. Small, but powerful. The angel, I just don't think I like. Maybe instead
    of an actual angel you have wings incorporated somehow or a halo. Typography,
    I like the feel of 'poco', 'creative' doesn't seem to connect with the feel of
    'poco'. Anyway, just some thoughts.\r\n\r\nmg"

  body: "Thanks for your thoughts and tips.   I guess I am trying to say a lot, and
    I don't necessarily want to emphasize the angel/spiritual, but I thought it was
    a neat idea.  I had a bird/dove at first with just a 'lady' (not angel), but it
    kind of seemed to resemble a towel (ha), and I can't seem to find the perfect
    font for 'creative.'  These were mockups along those lines that I made last month
    but dismissed (just rough screenshots).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_5083.jpg]\r\n\r\nCertainly
    the david / goliath is what I'm implying with the name and any mark ideas...  Before
    the 'angel' idea, here is what was going through my head concerning the little/big
    concept...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_5326.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    you can see I'm still quite in the brainstorming phase.  IMHO I am more gifted
    at coding than graphic design, but I think surely I can come up with something
    I am pleased with to represent myself to clients.   I can be patient and work
    at it, but at the same time I want to get it up on my main site in the near future,
    so I will have something substantial for my business."

    is too unclear at the moment and won\u2019t create a good impression. The combination
    of script and geometric type styles I find jarring, the proportion and composition
    is not helping, I would look at a less geometric sans or all script.\r\n\r\nIn
    brainstorming mode, maybe you could use \u2018the best things come in small packages\u2019
    as another option.\r\n\r\nTim"

    though, if it scales \"funny\" on web...  I made a mockup page today (on Safari)
    and scaled it to 140px wide.... and when I looked at a screenshot in Internet
    Explorer, it looked very grainy.  Ring a bell for anyone??\r\n\r\nYou (if you're
    on IE) can see what I'm talking about here [[http://pococreative.com/wp]]"

    pointy. other then that it's come a long way. good job.
