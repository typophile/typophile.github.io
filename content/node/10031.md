  body: Hi Chris, Welcome to the Type Identification Board. As a newcomer, we don&#39;t
    want to chase you away, but it might be a good idea for you to read some of the
    FAQ information. That would help you with posting images &#40;which didn&#39;t
    work this time, probably due to not using a .gif or .jpg file&#41;, and possibly
    about asking for free versions of commercial fonts. <BR> <BR>You see, as a type-loving
    community, including many font designers, we try not to promote &#39;free versions&#39;,
    as they are usually rip-offs of someone else&#39;s design work. We prefer to support
    the work of legitimate font designers, and those who are reviving old designs
    that have not been previously digitized. There are also designers of original
    fonts who choose to make their fonts available for free, and those are fine too.  <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s just the unauthorized, re-named copies of commercial fonts that make
    us get a little hostile. It&#39;s illegal, unethical and font piracy, plain and
    simple. <BR> <BR>I should say, that this is my attempt to say what I believe most
    of us think about this, since I do not speak for Typophile.com.  <BR> <BR>We are
    here to help you identify fonts. If you have that sort of question, come back
    as often as you need our help.

  body: Wait until Microsoft releases their new operating system in a year or two,
    Constantia will come free with that. Until then, you&#39;re unlikely to find it
    for free or otherwise. <BR> <BR>The only free font I can think of that approaches
    that style is <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=Gentium">Gentium</a>.

  body: Well, I guess it&#39;s overrated vs. underrated, so it&#39;s a matter of who
    is less over or more under. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>How about that Constantia,
    eh? Causing <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68190.html?1111771426"
