  know that a new French foundry launched last week (I am not related to the foundry
  - I just rather like the concept and the fonts): the Bureau des Affaires Typographiques.
  You can find all info in English here:\r\n\r\nhttp://beta.batfoundry.com/client/document/bat_communique_20100427en_49.pdf\r\n\r\nIMVHO
  I think Acier (a revival of Cassandre's type by Jean-Baptiste Lev\xE9e) will be
  of interest to many of you since I have seen it (or a closely related character)
  used in a number of vintage London Underground font.\r\n\r\nFrancesco by Franck
  Jalleau is also available in digital format for the first time I think. This is
  a fantastic character in extended latin, and will probably find an audience fairly
  soon. Very few of Franck Jalleau's creations are available so this is certainly
  great news!\r\n\r\nLet me also mention that www.typographies.fr is another multi-designer
  foundry from France, which has just won two awards from the TDC in 2009 & 2010."
