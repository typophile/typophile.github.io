  pardon any redundancy if this has been discussed already...\r\n\r\nI came across
  <a href=\"http://fontjazz.com/\">FontJazz</a> tonight (thanks @smashingmag via Twitter).
  Looks pretty good at first sight. Biggest advantages are its small size and that
  it runs client-side rather than server-side. Not sure about the licensing issue,
  and the biggest drawback I can see is that text is not actively selectable. What
  I mean is that you can't select letter-by-letter (as we tend to do), but if you
  select and copy text that includes the rendered heading, the heading <em>will</em>
  paste from the clipboard (there's just no visual feedback that you selected the
  header).\r\n\r\nAnyway, they say it's only in beta and promises to deliver more
  soon. I wonder if that includes info on issues with fonts' EULAs. I'm looking forward
  to trying it, just not now \u2014 it's 2:30 and I'm so going to bed..."

  body: "Now, isn't that an interesting bit of javascript.\r\n\r\nEssentially it converts
    a font file into a large gif and a single size with a font color and background
    and then uses javascript to place the letters with (hopefully) proper kerning.
    While it doesn't have near the functionality of sIFR, cufon or any of those other
    methods (in fact, it is pretty limited in terms of usage), it does provide a method
    of putting a custom font online without making it easily available for someone
    to steal. \r\n\r\nIt may not fly given that you are, in essence, decompiling the
    font and reassembling it in a new form (I think a number of EULAs ban that sort
    of behaviour), but other than that, it does seem to address security issues. The
    only flaw is the limited usage. \r\n\r\nNow, if they made it output PNG-24 instead
    of gif, then it would be more handy, even if it loses some applicability in IE6."

    potential.

    one uploads a font: to their central server? \r\n\r\nI'd question the kerning
    BTW. Unless of course the font they use themselves is badly kerned to begin with\u2026
    That \"Eleg ant\" on their \"Welcome\" page looks pretty bad. "

  body: "I did a test using a generic computer font and the way it works is that once
    they have processed the font, it gives you a 2 javascript files, one for the action
    itself and another with the font specifics. It also gives you back the image.
    So you'd upload all three to your personal server and run it from there.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yeah, I would question the kerning too. It seems like they figured some way to
    do basic kerning (it is applying different margins depending on the letter), but
    I doubt it has the functionality to deal with kerning pairs or such."

  body: "Ah, that's reassuring &ndash; thanks.\r\n\r\nSo it kinda does spacing but
    not kerning? Hey, now that you mention it, wasn't there somebody asking about
    this a while ago &ndash; how to \"extract\"/determine the sidebearings from a
    font to generate \"spaced\" single-glyph images? Although maybe that was about
    some server-side stuff."

    PNG with alpha-transparency (looks great with overlapping glyphs) and other fancy
    features, they're just not exposed in the UI yet - it's still in beta.\r\n\r\nNote
    that with IE, that feature will only work with IE 6 and newer, due to lacking
    PNG support in previous versions.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out in the next couple of
    weeks, more features will be added/exposed.\r\n"
