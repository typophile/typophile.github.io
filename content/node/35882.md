  body: "It would really depend on whether or not the font license is non-transferable.
    If the license can be transfered, there\u2019s no reason one could not bequeath
    it. But with non-transferable software licensing you\u2019ll probably need to
    talk to a lawyer."

  body: Be aware that many U.S. licences contain causes that are not valid outside
    of the U.S. and can simply be ignored. The EU countries have a much higher level
    of consumer protection laws (especially northern Europe) than the U.S. and those
    laws may render some clauses in the licences void.

  body: "Vertex,\r\n\r\nThat is a very interesting question. When I bought the original
    Adobe Font LIbrary (1989 or was that 1990) they sold it to me on a) floppy disks
    and 2) a hard disk for my imagesetter.\r\n\r\nThey told me if I ever got out of
    the business and wanted to sell it (that library was $15,000) I could sell it
    to anyone and they would have all the legal rights to it.\r\n\r\nI still own it
    - never sold it.\r\n\r\nI think jpad gave you good advice -- good luck."

    get screwed\u2014which is the whole point of DRM. The companies pushing DRM know
    that it will never stop piracy, but it will screw customers into buying the same
    old stuff over and over and never being able to unload it at the local used book/software/music/movie
    store. "
