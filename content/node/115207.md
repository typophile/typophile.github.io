body: "ReType Foundry proudly introduces Laski Slab, a comprehensive suite of 20 fonts
  conceived for editorial purposes. The type family was designed by Paula Mastrangelo,
  an Art Director with extensive experience in editorial design specialized in corporate
  communication. Originally developed for an online children\u2019s magazine, Laski
  was expanded into a multipurpose type family with the technical assistance of Ramiro
  Espinoza.\r\n\r\nBelying the intrinsic robustness of the slab serif genre, Laski\u2019s
  humanistic construction and subtle calligraphic details lend it a friendly appearance.
  Round, open letter forms and generous horizontal proportions make it easy to read.
  The regular weights perform impeccably in text sizes, while the bolder versions
  produce expressive and very effective subheadings and headlines. Two idiosyncratic
  stencil variants considerably expand Laski\u2019s creative potential.\r\n\r\nLaski
  Slab is a suite of feature-rich OpenType fonts fully equipped to tackle complex,
  professional typography. The character set includes 5 sets of numerals, small caps,
  fractions, alternate characters and case-sensitive forms. Besides standard Latin
  its extensive character set supports Central European, Baltic and Turkish languages.\r\n\r\nLaski
  Slab received a \u201CCertificate of Excellence\u201D at the 2014 Tipos Latinos
  Biennale.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.re-type.com|Visit Laski Slab at ReType]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/laski-newsletter-news_4224.png]"
