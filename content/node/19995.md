body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Books]] : The Complete Manual of Typography</strong>\r\n\r\nThis
  book is a much needed contemporary guide to the ages old craft of [[typography]].
  In the introduction, Felici explains that it is a guide to 'execution' and not a
  style guide. Throughout it's pages, he uses limited illustrations to explain such
  topics as the correct 'color' of a block of text, appropriate use of Small Caps,
  Tracking and Kerning, Managing Indentation and Alignment, Special Characters and
  Special Situations , Document Styles and Typopraphic Conventions, Tables and Language
  Specific Issues rounded off by a comprehensive glossary of typographic terms to
  make what is arguably the best technical reference manual on Typography to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FeliciCMT_6421.jpg]"
