  have searched several sites including Identifont, DaFont, and Type Navigator looking

  lies in the \"o\".\r\n\r\nAs for the bold, non-script font, I have no idea.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCataylo"

  body: "I believe the reason for your difficulty is that the lettering is probably
    hand-drawn, but the large letters are rather like Pink Broccoli's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pink-broccoli/hideaway/|Hideaway]].
    You could probably use any of several formal scripts in place of the script used
    here and no one would notice the switch.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
