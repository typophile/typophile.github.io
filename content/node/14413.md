body: "Hi! Everybody\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I use fontlab and I have a big
  problem because there are some nodes I can't connect, if you move them they move
  individually.I created them in illustrator and then exported them to fontlab as
  EPS, and before this I checked in illustrator that the nodes were joined, and they
  were, but I don't know what happens in fontlab.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what's
  wrong or if there are any good tutorials for me to learn?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced"
