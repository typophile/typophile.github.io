  body: 'It&#39;s Kurt Weidemann&#39;s Corporate A &#40;A for Antiqua&#41;. There
    also is a SansSerif Typeface and an Egyptienne with a dash of typewriter-style.
    Very strange OSFs, very distinctive flavour all over. '

  body: Fontdude you make enterprises more important than Robert Cannon. I&#39;d look
    at stacking Robert Cannon Enterprises on three lines justified left/right. Keep
    Robert and Cannon the same size and make Enterprises smaller, &#40;its the least
    important&#41;. Just a thought
