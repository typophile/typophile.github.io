    of the fonts Jonathan Hoefler presents as examples for different type styles are
    inspired by/revivals of older typefaces.\r\n\r\nBTW, Arial is already \u201Cinspired
    by\u201D Helvetica."

  body: "Thanks, Typography 101 was really interesting.\r\n\r\nIm progressing slowly
    but wondering if anyone knows of any fonts derived from/ inspired by:\r\n\r\nDidot\r\nClarendon\r\nBodoni\r\nJoanna\r\nSabon\r\nRockwell\r\nFranklin
    Gothic\r\nPerpetua\r\nCourier\r\nEurostile\r\n\r\nI have now worked out the chronology
    of the 50 fonts im researching so have decided these older fonts are likely to
    be the inspiration behind more modern fonts.\r\nThanks!"
