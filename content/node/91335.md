    what Nick couldn't resist -- except he did. I'm too old & ugly to go chasing women
    with my clothes off, even with your help. Besides, I think we have laws against
    that in the States.\r\n\r\n(And my P.S. -- what about Windoes? We keep weighting.)"

    body: "David, \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio 5.1.x is a free update to FLS 5. Nominally,
      there are no new features apart from some that \"came in for free\" (as they
      were already implemented). The vast amount of the effort (2-man-years) went
      into porting the code to Mac Intel. *Actual* new features will be included in
      FontLab Studio 6, which we're currently working on. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nAdam"

  body: Well... Ya dint answer the question but that's alright! I dont consider having
    proper control points on truetype fonts to be a "new feature" so much as an old
    bug. When I talked to Yuri and yourself about dis issue with TT, Yuri said it'd
    take a couple hours to fix... Even if it took 24 hours, that talk was more than
    20,000 hours ago, so I "get the message". Got it a while ago, actually, and so
    10,000 hours ago we were utterly forced into "Plan B". :)

    to come. \r\n\r\nI'm very glad that there's Plan B available now, BTW. More options
    is an inherently good thing. "
