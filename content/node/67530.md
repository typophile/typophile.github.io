  body: "It's an old Image Club font called Paisley. The A is from Paisley Two Alternate,
    and it has been reversed. There is a sample in my [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg25.html|Script
    Font ID Guide]]. Paisley Two is just the bold version of Paisley One.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hmm, the Paisley One Alt 'A' is not the same as the one in Paisley Two Alt.
    I think you'll have to trust me on this one, unless you want to wait for me to
    make a sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: too many differences. Probably a freeware font that someone based off of Paisley

  body: If you look at the font on Fonts.com, you'll see that Paisley 2 is a package
    of two fonts. The website lets you view the characters in both fonts. Several
    of the characters are from the Alt font. The 'D' and 's' have been mirrored horizontally
    and the 'A' vertically. All the characters are in those two fonts, though.

    to prove my case.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
