  for some new signs on old buildings. I have tried to scan it but no websites could
  automatically identify it. The font is from a building in Lyngby north of Copenhagen,
  Denmark. Built around 1910.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the font so characteristic is the
  small \"dots\" in the middle of all the letters. I guess they used the \"dots\"
  for fixing the font to the facade.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated. "

    to operina.com the typefaces like these were very popular in 19th century  but
    their usage got stopped and they are returning again. You can find fore information

    any fonts that comes close enough in the book \"Examples of modern alphabets\"
    that you linked to. Do you have any other suggestions? \r\n\r\nIf I could buy
    the font somewhere that would of course be preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nJesper"
