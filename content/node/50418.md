  logo made by local designers for the fast food chain- russian fast food- we paid
  them good money and they try to convince us it's a master peice...but i doubt for
  some reason...\r\n\r\n\r\nsorry for Cyrillic font...but general look is what matters
  i think...\r\nthe name of the venue is BOLSHOY KUSH which can be put into english
  as KING'S RANSOM or SCOOP or BIG ROLL...smth like that\r\n\r\n\r\nwell so every
  opinion will be of great value to me\r\n\r\n\r\nthanx in advance\r\n\r\nAnastasia"

  body: "I like the lettering. I also like the image however it doesn't suggest a
    big meal to me. Depending on the colour it is one solitary carrot, beetroot or
    turnip. It is showing a single, raw, cooking ingredient. If the logo really needs
    a pictorial element you need something that looks more appetising. It doesn't
    have to be food itself. It could be some kind of dish food is cooked in or served
    from.\r\n"

    ...\r\n\r\nbut just going off the information you've presented I reckon it's pretty
    lame.\r\n\r\nfirst, and most of all - it doesn't say 'fast food'.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing
    there wasn't a whole lot of research done into demographics etc. \r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "\"it doesn\u2019t say \u2019fast food\u2019\"\r\n\r\nShould it? At least
    here in the US, fast food is *not* synonymous with healthy food.\r\n\r\nThis logo
    'feels' more like an artisan bread shop/cafe, so maybe it's in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAll
    that said, it's nearly impossible for us to give you anything but gut reactions
    on the aesthetics without a lot more details. \r\n\r\nMy pure gut reaction: these
    are hardly the worst logos I've ever seen, though perhaps not the best either.
    But not knowing the budget/process, I can't really say if they were a good solution
    for your needs or not."

    (unique saling proposition) of the cafe, (canteen) implies that it's not just
    classic fast food , which is known  worldwide as a non-healthy one, but a FAST
    but which is vitally important healthy food! It's not like a typical fast food

  body: "Hmm. The combination of \"fast food\" and \"healthy\" - at least in the U.S.
    - would have been an interesting and different design project for any designer.
    (To be able to convey good-quality food, available fast-food style.)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    they could have experimented more with the concept of \"fast\" in combination
    with \"quality\" in the type design. It is an interesting combo, since the two
    concepts don't inherently go together...\r\n\r\nAny update on a new design? I'm
    curious to see the final logo."

    necessarily ... but if it's \"fast food\" it's gonna have to communicate with
    people in a different way (to the way it does) - in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAs you
    say it's feeling more \"artisan bread shop\" at the moment - which might be fine.
    The original info we had to run with was \"fast food.\" It doesn't say fast right
    now, which seems to be the key message.\r\n\r\nAlthough healthy has been added
    to the mix too now.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
