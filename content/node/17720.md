body: "OK I need some help.\r\n\r\nOriginally I proposed that we do this events diary
  for my car club - it was going to be A4 in sized and looked quite cute when I mocked
  it up first time around. The problem is we made a decision to make it A3 - and now
  it doesn't quite work! Line lengths are too long - I've had to do some tracking
  to fit in a logo (still one missing to be added) - plus we have even more events
  to put on it meaning that it's all crammed up.\r\n\r\nHere's the current state of
  things: (n.b it's A3 and meant to be cross folded)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mintylamb.co.uk/upload/flyerfinal4proof.pdf\r\n\r\nIt's
  going to be cross folded - on the other side are 4 photos (one in each quarter)
  with a calendar running across the bottom of each one and the relevant dates shaded
  in.\r\n\r\nIt's my first proper piece of print work (getting 3,000 printed) - and
  am a bit worried about delivering the goods. Note this is voluntary work so am not
  getting paid or anything."

  body: "sorry for the barrage of questions, but all of this plays a role in how your
    piece will function and should thereby dictate how you lay the info on the page.\r\n\r\n...so
    i assume you can work with full color (because it's printed digital). i was just
    curious because i noticed that you had a full color logo but are only using one
    color for everything else. it could be more interesting to introduce another color.\r\n\r\nalso,
    is this only one sided?\r\n\r\nnext would be how you need to distribute the piece.
    does it need to be in the format that it's in now? if you are going to mail it
    out, there are limitations about what size envelope you will use, or if the addresses
    goes directly on the piece there are guidlines that the postal service sets so
    it can go through the mail properly. if none of these things are an issue, you
    might want to change the format.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nnc"

  body: "Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nIt's two sided - on the other side will look
    something like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mintylamb.co.uk/upload/flyer-otherside.pdf\r\n\r\nSo
    yes it will be full colour. The idea is you stick this other side on the wall
    and use it as a calendar.\r\n\r\nIt's a flyer that will be distributed by hand
    - at shows it will be handed out. So no mailing issues.\r\n"

  body: "got it. i was just studying the pdf and forgot that you had mentioned the
    fact that it was two-sided in your original post.\r\n\r\ni think there are some
    hierarchy issues that you should re-work:\r\n\r\n1.  perhaps adding a second color,
    like a light gray ( or a light color that works with your blue), to the table
    would help you increase some contrast.\r\n\r\n2.  perhaps you should choose a
    typeface that is more suitable for smaller text sizes (which is easier said than
    done). there are several to choose from and and this issue is always up for debate,
    but i will go ahead and suggest<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/charter/familytree.html\">
    Charter</a>. \r\n\r\n3.  the type is too tight. at 8pt, this is very diffcult
    to read at the default 9.5 pt line spacing. perhaps you could air it out to a
    10 or 11 pt line spacing. which leads to the next suggestion.\r\n\r\n4.  break
    the layout into two columns and leave some room on the top for the club logo.
    \r\n<a href=\"http://www.istitch.net/typophile/2column.jpg\">sketch 1</a>\r\nif
    you want to keep the \"front\", you can fold it into quadrants, which would give
    you the lower left quadrant which would allow more space. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.istitch.net/typophile/2column2.jpg\">sketch
    2</a> \r\n\r\n5.  you can introduce an italic weight for the place names of your
    events:\r\n\r\n<strong>International Triumph Show and Spares Day</strong> \u2013
    <em>Stoneleigh</em>\r\n \r\n6.  also, the intro paragraph seems out of place.
    perhaps it would look better if you increased it by 1 or 2 pts (and the linespcaing,
    respectively), and line it up with the rest of the (indented) text.\r\n\r\n7.
    \ overall, you just need more contrast to increase the hierarchy and more room
    for the type to breathe.\r\n\r\n\r\nhope this helps,\r\n\r\n---------------------

  body: "Thanks for the comments again.\r\n\r\nA second colour - yes that is really
    needed.\r\n\r\nI like the italics idea on the place names.\r\n\r\nI wanted to
    avoid using the back page.\r\n\r\nI still think the problem is the layout on the
    A4 page - it worked well when it was only A5 and only a few events. Need to work
    harder on that. I think I need to split it in to columns. I think I need to forget
    about what I've done so far and start a fresh (on the events listing)"
