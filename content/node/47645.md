body: "I attended a two-part workshop preceding the annual TypeCon convention last
  week that was for beginning or aspiring font designers. It turned out largely to
  be a tour of the software more than anything else - the software being TypeTool,
  which is a stripped-down, consumer version of FontLab. The software-centric focus
  of the workshop probably should not come as a surprise, as the workshop was led
  by FontLab's president. I got some good pointers out of the day of experimenting,
  but the many questions I have about what to consider when undertaking a font design
  that extend beyond the tools remained unaddressed.\r\n\r\nThis lack was remedied
  a bit by sitting in on TypeCon's font crit session, which was fascinating and fun.\r\n\r\nI
  picked up Cabarga's <em>Learn FontLab Fast</em> at the convention, too. \r\n\r\nOh,
  and here was a good tip I picked up along the way at TypeCon: capital R is a pretty
  good candidate for beginning a design, since only in drawing it will you have to
  come up with solutions for an upright stem, a round bowl, and a diagonal, the elements
  that together go quite a ways towards determining the character of a font."

    section here under the Typowiki. Also, you might try Gunnlauger Briem's site:
    \r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/\r\n\r\nYou can always ask questions on Typophile,
    but its a good practice to do a search first.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions, Stephen. I was familiar with both, but I especially
    appreciate the reminder about the wiki being a pretty good way into the stuff
    here.
