body: "Hello hello,\r\n\r\nSo obviously this isn't a font. It's a carved inscription,
  which has since been painted black, on a Georgian era building in Broadstairs, Kent,
  on the southeast coast of England. Is anyone aware of a digital typeface that would
  be similar in character? The trick is, I'm looking for something that has both small
  caps AND italic small caps. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1820-modern/\">1820
  Modern</a> feels close and has the requisite SC/Italic SC, but the height of the
  small caps is a little low, and the italic L a bit too slanty and eccentric.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any ideas anyone has!\r\n\r\nErik\r\n"
