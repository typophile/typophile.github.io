body: I am the Youth Development Director for Girls Inc. I had t-shirts made for my
  dance team girls & have had several parents that I would like to give shirts too.  I
  simply want to add "Mom", Grandma, Dad, etc. to them, but I can't seem to get the
  right font.  Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thanks so much...Gracie

    Black</a>, but frankly I don't think I've seen this one before. Who designed the
    original logo?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, if you want to simply add something, you
    might go for contrast and use a dynamic, solid script face at the bottom of the
    logo. Just a suggestion."

    but also no cigar.
