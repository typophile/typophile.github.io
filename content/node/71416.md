body: "Hello there everybody, I've been looking for some information on this forum
  for a while now and I've registered to ask one question so if you can help me it
  would be great.\r\nThe problem is that now when I paste some element(s) from Illustrator
  (CS5) to FontLab (5.0.4) the pasted glyph is for some reason bigger that it should
  be because I've set 1000pt height in Illustrator and UPM Size in FontLab at 2000
  so it should work perfectly and it DID but now, for some (to me) unknown reason
  it doesn't... And also I've noticed that when I copy the letter (for instance C)
  and paste it into FontLab it gets bigger (to the height of the \u010C - the height
  of the ascender) BUT when I copy letter C and ALSO the letter \u010C than C is pasted
  much smaller, something like it should be at 2000 UPM but it still doesn't fit perfect.\r\n\r\nSo
  please if anyone has any answer I would be very grateful :)"

  body: I haven't done this in while, but IIRC, the trick is to draw a same-size bounding
    box around each glyph in the Illustrator file, which will then snap to the baseline-to-cap
    dimension when imported into Fontlab. Or something like that.

    I did copy/paste in two steps (say, first the C and later the caron).\r\n\r\nBut
    soon I begun to do all design in FontLab. It's much more productive, although
    you have to adapt yourself during two or three days."

    trick for importing is to set the ascent at 100% of the em square height, then
    add spacer tick marks to the glyphs delineating the top and bottom of said square.
    Once all of the glyphs are imported, drag a guideline to mark the baseline of
    the type, and make a note of its vertical position. Then, reset your ascent to
    match the vertical area above this guideline, and your descent to match the vertical
    area below. Then, select all characters and shift them down the same number of
    units as the descender."

  body: Fontographer 5 is even more like Freehand. The drawing tools come exactly
    from the same source. In fact, Freehand was *based* on Fontographer (both developed
    at Altsys, then moved to Macromedia). Now Fontographer has a safe harbor at Fontlab
    Ltd., and Freehand has vanished in the Adobe oblivion :)

    just because it is easier to do better work in Fontographer. But I have always
    wondered why I can not cut and paste Fontographer shapes into FontLab.

  body: "Oldnick, \r\n\r\nScaling and rotation in FontLab Studio is of course based
    on integer coordinates, so there are limitation. If you perform multiple additive
    small operations (scale up-down-up-down, rotate with small degrees back-forth-forth-back
    etc.), you'll get accumulated rounding errors. One way to avoid it or minimize
    it is to set the UPM size of the font higher for the design process (UPM = 3000
    or even 10,000).\r\n\r\nFontographer 5, which allows fractional coordinates, is
    free from those accumulated rounding errors, so in this sense it is very much
    like Freehand, and somewhat similar to Illustrator. \r\n\r\nIn FontLab Studio
    6, we won't be able to allow fractional coordinates, unfortunately (since the
    integer coordinates are buried in many places of the code), but in a later version
    we do plan to do it. "
