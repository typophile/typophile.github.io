  body: "Hi Uli. Thanks for this informative post. (Perhaps you can check out an old
    thread to answer a couple of questions I posed: http://typophile.com/node/36478?page=1
    )\r\n\r\nAs for James Montalbano's statement: From what I can tell, most of the
    people making fonts are \"garagistes\" - passionate amateurs - and the likelihood
    that they will ever produce anything of great value is small. Just look at the
    flood of dross which is MyFonts and I think you'll agree that while there is money
    to be made in typography, that's not the place to do it. Unless you are the director
    of MyFonts, in which case you probably do very well on the basis of economies
    of scale.\r\n\r\nDoesn't mean that people shouldn't keep doing it. It's like being
    in a bar band; you can make pocket money doing it and have a lot of fun, but most
    bar bands are simply not interesting enough for \"the big time\".\r\n\r\nJN"

  body: I'm going to state something very obvious here, although I'm not a type designer,
    but a type user, and enthusiast... the amount of money you make is dependent upon
    the typefaces you offer. The independent foundries and designers that do well,
    are doing well because they are producing something that people want. You can
    make money doing almost anything if you do it well. Look at LucasFonts. How much
    do you think he has banked off his Thesis family? I remember getting a specimen
    back in '95 and thinking it was an awesome achievement, and it is. It is still
    going strong. Look at H&FJ, their typefaces are solid designs that are seen everywhere.

  body: "<em>On average, how much time on the market does it take for a font to bring
    back six hundred dollars?</em>\r\n\r\nThere are so many variables (IE a single
    sloppy font that took a day to make or a complex family that took years) The time
    spent often shows in the design. Also the end price, if the font is $600, then
    one sale does it)\r\n\r\nBottom line is, some fonts sell and some do not. There
    is only so much market research and weighing investment on return that can go
    into it. Most people make fonts to fill a perceived void (in the type world in
    general or personal achievement). Going into it for financial gain is a very risky
    proposition but not unattainable.\r\n\r\nI am curious how the seemingly arbitrary
    figure of $600 came up?\r\n"

  body: "<em>and don\u2019t give it all away to a foundry or reseller.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    agree with the foundry part, although it might not be a bad way for some to start
    out in the business.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't see what's wrong with having distributors.
    Typically they take 50%, but they provide access to markets a foundry will not
    find otherwise.\r\nAlso consider the increasing (and long overdue) sophistication
    of online retailers, driving traffic to their sites. It takes a heck of a lot
    of effort to generate traffic to one's own site for direct sales, and to provide
    constantly refreshing content.\r\n\r\nI'd say that in future things will go well
    for foundries that are able to co-ordinate font development, direct retail sales,
    and integrate marketing across the board with a variety of distributors -- which
    is a pretty straightforward business model going way back in time.\r\n\r\nI have
    a number of distributors. I do find it difficult to produce a campaign they all
    can use. Everyone has their own standards for things like the size of banner ads,
    and most do not even use co-op (supplier-generated) marketing material, which
    seems to me a missed oportunity, because everyone benefits from synergy."
