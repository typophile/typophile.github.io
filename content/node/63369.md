  \ However, the 'M' (which has straight sides) is a better match to Frutiger.  What,
  in fact, is the original?\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_6254.jpg]"

    if that's the one you meant Jan, and it seems closer to Frutiger than Myriad.
    \r\n\r\nI was thinking I recently saw a new sans with a Myriad-like y, but can't
    think where I saw it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    a specimen anywhere to check. Ascender doesn\u2019t provide one for whatever reason.
    From what I\u2019ve seen at least the \u2018M\u2019 in Segoe has vertical stems."

    like MM still has the tilted \"M\" characters.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myriadMM_5610.jpg]"
