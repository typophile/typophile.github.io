  body: 'I guess it all depends what version of Din you use. I was looking at DIN
    1451 Mittelschrift rather than your standard Din. Level of confusion: 5 <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

  body: You&#39;re absolutely right Jeff. FF DIN is just one interpretation, but <BR>it&#39;s
    probably the most complete and usable of all digital DINs.

  body: Then again, why use DIN when everybody and their mother in law  <BR>is using
    it already? There&#39;s plenty of alternatives that&#39;ll make your  <BR>work
    stand out instead of blend in. <BR> <BR>Oooh, 9 more posts to go! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
