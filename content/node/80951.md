  'Y' and 'K' from my name to make a logo.\r\n\r\nI want the slants of the 'Y' and
  'K' to match up so that the logo can open up when pressed and reveal the different
  options that can be pressed. The options themselves will be separated with '/' signs
  which match the 'Y' and 'K'. \r\nPlease see attached picture for example. (Though
  obviously I want to use a much nicer typeface than the one from the e.g.).\r\n\r\nDo
  you know of a typeface that has a caplock 'Y' and 'K' (and '/') that relate to each
  other in this way?\r\nI prefer not to use an italic if possible.\r\nIf need be I
  can use a lower case 'y' and 'k'.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n:)"

    for all promotional material and would be easier if I found an existing one.\r\n\r\nI
    found 'Avantis BQ Bold' - But I dont like it all that much.\r\n\r\nIf you know
    of others let me know...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
