  body: I&#39;ve always assumed before &#40;without examining it very closely&#41;
    that it was derived from ITC Galliard -- something about the bowl of the D and
    the overall proportions just emanate Galliard. Your image is too small and fuzzy,
    and the only copy of the logo I have at hand is on a smudgy photocopy, so I can&#39;t
    be certain.  <BR> <BR>If it was built from Galliard, then there have been some
    significant alterations -- beyond just the obvious truncations. The middle bar
    of the F was shortened and the top serif changed to angle out. And the tell-tale
    join of the Galliard R was abandoned in order to make the leg connect more like
    that of the K. But the O and the D are dead ringers for Galliard. <BR> <BR>Unless
    you&#39;re trying to reproduce the logo exactly, take a look at the Galliard caps
    and see if they don&#39;t provide the look you&#39;re after. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: I must admit that at first sight the similarities  <BR>with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-galliard/roman/testdrive.html?s=OXFORD&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> ITC Galliard</a> seemed obvious, but as Kent  <BR>explains it
    so well the join in the &#39;R&#39; put me off.  <BR>The &#39;X&#39; also appears
    to be wider, although that&#39;s  <BR>difficult to judge with such a small and
    blurry  <BR>sample. <BR> <BR>I found Oxford University Press amongst the client  <BR>list
    of <a href="http://www.pcdx.com/pcd/clients.htm" target="_blank"> Perfect Circle
    Design</a>. I couldn&#39;t make out  <BR>if they designed the logo too, but maybe
    you could  <BR>ask them if they have more information?
