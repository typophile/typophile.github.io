    as well (for the foreign editions, as they never needed more than a few words...)\r\n\r\nSeems
    this has come up before:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/42360]]"

  body: "I had figured that it was handwritten as well, but had hoped that it could
    have been a font with multiple character options. It has such a wonderful and
    playful feel that may be hard to replicate.\r\n\r\nThanks as well for the link
    to the other comment string. I'll see if one of the further script fonts suggested
    could possibly work."
