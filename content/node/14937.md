body: "I'm having problems with a few files that are being sent to me by a customer.
  They are PDF's that have everything embedded but I'm unable to make any edits with
  the fonts they used. When I try I get a warning that says I cannot edit that font.
  The customer told me which fonts to buy - FuturaStd1 library and BodoniStd1 library--
  As it turns out these are OpenType fonts that I purchased from Adobe. The problem
  is that the customer is using the TrueType version and they are not showing up as
  available in my library.\r\n\r\nAm I stuck with buying the TrueType version now?
  Or is there something in distiller that will make those fonts editable?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Dave"

  body: "1. \"TrueType\" is also OpenType. OpenType encompasses two font formats:
    OpenType PS (.otf) and OpenType TT (.ttf). The latter was formerly known as TrueType.
    So what you're talking is the distinction between OpenType PS and OpenType TT
    / TrueType. \r\n\r\n2. Fonts named \"Futura Std\" or \"Bodoni Std\" were never
    sold in the OpenType TT / TrueType format. They're only available in the OpenType
    PS format. \r\n\r\n3. There are many versions of Futura and Bodoni available from
    many vendors (Adobe, Bitstream, Linotype, Bitstream, URW, Monotype/ITC and others),
    both in OpenType TT / TrueType and in OpenType PS format. Some permit editable
    embedding, some only permit read-only embedding (aka \"print & preview\"). This
    has nothing to do with the font format. \r\n\r\nSo what you're looking for is
    not a font in either OT TT or OT PS but a font with a license for editable embedding.
    \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nA.\r\n"

    body: "So this would explain why in Acrobat6 when I look at the properties of
      the document where I have changed the fonts to the specific fonts I have, they
      are identified as PS fonts.(?) Does that sound right? So I need to go back and
      buy the OpenTypeTT fonts right? And then I need to make sure that my customer
      is using a font license that allows editing by a different user. (?)\r\n\r\nDave "

    fonts*, so if these really are TTF's the customer or someone else must have converted
    them from the OpenType PS fonts. My understanding of the Adobe EULA is that conversion
    is allowed and that the customer can provide the converted fonts to you, and you're
    allowed to use them udner the license you purchsed for the OpenType PS versions
    from Adobe. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n*excluding the web type pack released in
    1998."

  body: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nIf you use a PDF editor like PitStop, you could have the
    customer send you the file again with the fonts converted to a system font like
    courier and then replace it with a new font in Acrobat using the PitStop Inspector
    window. You can download a trial version at the link below: <li>www.enfocus.co.uk/downloads/downloads_index.html.\r\n\r\nReid"
