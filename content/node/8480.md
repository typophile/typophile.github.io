  body: 'Pretty good; transforming Hebrew into a grotesque is not an easy task. <BR>
    <BR>Points to consider: <BR> <BR>Keep in mind whether you&#39;re going for a flat
    or rounded top <BR> <BR>The samech could use a rounder bottom stroke to better
    differentiate it from the final mem. <BR> <BR>The extra lip looks good on some
    of the letters, but falls kind of flat on the feys. <BR> <BR>Also, the hey needs
    to be tightened up; there&#39;s more whitespace inside the letter than there is
    between it and the vav.'

  body: I agree that the traps on the feys are not working.  <BR> <BR>The roundness
    of the tops is a nice idea, but the way the curves on the tops of the letters
    flatten toward the left is currently awkward; you need to tweak this, though maybe
    not much. I agree about the top gap above the &#39;leg&#39; of the hey - also
    the kof. Is the beit to wide? Would just slightly narrowing the verticals help
    or hurt?  <BR> <BR>I am not that knowledgeable on Hebrew, so take this all with
    a grain of salt. I would compare your letter proportions to other successful &#39;sans&#39;
    style Hebrew faces.

  body: 'I like the round tops, Hebrew characters tend to be excessively boxy. You
    have flat tops on a few letters and I wonder why those particular letters: delet
    and quf for instance. Does the font look bad if all the letters are rounded? <BR>
    <BR>The final tsadeh looks uncomfortable. <BR> <BR>However I think it&#39;s good
    that you differentiate the heh from the het by exagerating the white space in
    the hey. In some Hebrew fonts these two letters are almost identical. <BR> <BR>In
    smaller sizes, the &#34;lip&#34; on top left of the het, mem, samech, peh and
    tav is almost invisible. Maybe you could make it more pronounced. <BR> <BR>It
    would be nice to see a page of text - or at least a few sentences with some punctuation.

  body: "The rounded tops of the letters are the \"key\" to your font - it's a smart
    thing to choose which letters will get the rounded feature and which won't, but
    you still have a small problem with consistency. I would advise turning to FrankRuhl
    and observing the differences between letters like Dalet and Resh.\r\n\r\nYou
    have a very gracious Samekh... That's it, I don't think I have any more to add
    to the previous comments posted... Good luck!"
