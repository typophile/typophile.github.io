  Class Kerning and decided not to expand to conventional kerning, so I have a very
  clean file, only a few kbs, etc.\r\nthe problem is that I can't have a correct preview
  of font in Linotype Fontexplorer X  nor in MyFonts preview. (Adobe apps all support)\r\ndo
  you think we have to still use conventional kerning creating redundant information
  in font files?"

    widely, thought still not everywhere. So this is what, in my opinion, you should
    count on. I think that font managers' and websites' font previews are the least
    thing to care for. They are just that: previews. It is them which should adapt
    to current OT standards, not the other way round."

  body: "I suppose, as a stop-gap measure, you could write a script that would apply
    your class-based kerning indivudually to every single letter combination.  It
    would balloon file size but would allow you to continue working with class-based
    in program, and then only need to run the script once right before producing the
    font.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta

    into \"hard\" kerns stored in a separate font table which can be accessed by previewers.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also inspect and edit these hard kerns in the list on the right side of the
    Metrics window.\r\n\r\nFL provides various criteria by which you may limit the
    number of kern pairs generated by the Expand process, allowing you to limit ballooning.\r\n"

    to do it. \r\nI do prefer not to expand. the big problem is that people buy fonts
