  It'll probably be expensive, but it would be really great for extended and custom
  keyboard maps. I bet you can change the font up, too...

    one actually look at the keys and can I change the typeface? ;^) Cool stuff.

  body: "\"Pretty amazing stuff, but in the end, how often does one actually look
    at the keys and can I change the typeface?\"\r\n\"There is something about that
    keyboard that I find very attractive.\"\r\n\r\nHm.\r\nI think this keyboard is
    more than just nice, and much more than a \"gimmick\" for photoshoppers and game
    addicts.\r\nPlease remember that the US keyboard layout is just the US keyboard
    layout. The world is a bit bigger than that. You may not need to look at your
    keys when using your keyboard, but then, make holidays in Germany and try the
    German one: you may switch to the US keyboard layout in the OS, yet you may feel
    quite lost if you search for particular symbols. This keyboard would help you
    feel like home, wherever you are.  ;-)\r\nAlso, think of large parts of the world
    who actually live with two or more writing systems. It IS helpful to see what
    is \"behind\" each key. You may not look at your keyboard most of the time, but
    do you REALLY know the layout by heart? Who does?\r\nThen, this keyboard could
    even show you symbols available when holding shift, ctrl, alt, apple.\r\nOr, it
    could show you glyphs as they look like in the currently selected font. Or, it
    could show you the glyphs which you get if an OpenType feature is activated.\r\nThink
    of typing e.g. Chinese or Japanese. Currently this is typed piecemeal on a US
    keyboard, then a popup appears on screen showing a selection of symbols which
    share this pronunciation, and you select one. With Optimus, the selection could
    be displayed directly on the keys, say numeral keys, so you just hit one of them.
    No mouse required.\r\nMost of this is musing. Use your imagination!\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Instead of realizing the relevance of really useful things like this keyboard,
    certain computer manufacturers add backlit keys and webcams to their notebooks
    and advertise this as \"innovation.\" Haha."
