<a href="http://typophile.com/node/99960">http://typophile.com/node/99960</a></p>
<p>The basic question concerning the use of Roboto. Is this font is suited for print work or it&rsquo;s a font to use in Web only? The second issue is about the license, may I use it for print on corporate use (no object will be sale with the font on it, example: no tshirt, no poster…). Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody">IIRC, many people&rsquo;s beef with Roboto was that it didn&rsquo;t look good in print, so don&rsquo;t expect flowers and unicorns. As for the licence, it&rsquo;s the Apache licence, version 2.0, and as far as I can tell, it does not limit what you can use it for. But how the Dis I&rsquo;m gunna arrange it for a symphonic orchestra and two death metal bands, I&rsquo;m yet to figure out.</div>

If it doesn&rsquo;t look good in print, it may have been a poor choice for Android devices, which now often have 300+ ppi screens. If it was intended for Android 2.3 ICS only, that may be a forgivable sin, since there are fewer hi-ppi devices&ndash;but certainly one that should be reconsidered. We are quickly approaching a point where there is no important difference between &lsquo;screen&rsquo; and &lsquo;print&rsquo;, other than that text on a mobile device UI may be at low point sizes and accommodate UI elements.</div>

I understand your use case. 
I think a BSD license would let you do this too, but I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is distributing fonts this way. Also, I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. The point is, there are many different FOSS licenses, created and used for a variety of real and imagined reasons, and its a big confusing mess. I&rsquo;m sure we can at least agree on that point. The &lsquo;big hypothetical list&rsquo; I&rsquo;m talking about would be a central clearinghouse to sort out the minutia.  Does such a thing exist?</div>

<p>Right. If you make a proprietary font for a minority script, that&rsquo;s working against the social justice aims of the libre movement. If a professional decides it&rsquo;s profitable (or at least not a total loss :-) to make a new libre font, that&rsquo;s really great.

<p>The OFL protects libre fonts from this tragedy, which is why almost all type designers prefer it, and why the designers of the small number of Apache fonts asked to move to OFL.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, because not having any (or very few) good fonts is more socially unjust than having (more) good proprietary ones. Remember, social justice is more about the reader than the designer; social justice says: the designer not wanting to give up money should not harm the reader.</p>

<p>I think this is the weak link in your logic. Users of open tools are not inherently more mindful of their users than users of proprietary tools; in fact their general resistance to compensating quality often makes things worse for their users, while making themselves richer. I&rsquo;ve said this before: many open-source advocates -like yourself- are altruistic; most of them however -like the ones who don&rsquo;t bother engaging in such discussions- are simply taking advantage. This is the big unspoken sad reality in the open-source scene.</p>
<p>But let me back up and offer another angle, to better explain what I was previously saying: the current (and long-standing) situation with Armenian fonts is not socially just to Armenian end-users - there are very few typefaces we can be proud of. This is certainly not because there&rsquo;s a lack of respect for the Armenian script or a lack of talent in type design. It&rsquo;s because of a lack of profitability. Apache helps us, as a people. And I posit that the situation is similar with most minority scripts. Apache is in effect the best gift to them; the more restrictive licenses severely limit the development of high-quality fonts because there are very few people who will donate big chunks of their lives like that. I think Westerners -because they don&rsquo;t have to work as hard to survive- generally have trouble relating to this seemingly selfish -but in reality very communal, although not global- approach to spending one&rsquo;s time/resources.</p>
<blockquote>But was it libre?</blockquote>
<p>It has a minimal EULA that prohibits resale&hellip; but there&rsquo;s no talk of modification, which is intentional. I don&rsquo;t believe a no-mod clause is usually ethical, so there&rsquo;s no de jure restriction against somebody selling a modified Arasan. In practice however Arasan has not been redistributed/resold in a modified version (AFAIK) because most of its value comes from the embedded bitmaps, which is technically relatively tricky to do (although the tools are free); plus unlike a Latin font there aren&rsquo;t many niceties one can add anyway.</p>
<blockquote>but the font designers wish that the fonts be treated as OFL ought to be respected, don't you think?</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. I can feel entirely comfortable classing the needs of my people above the needs of one guy, especially if I feel he&rsquo;s failing to grasp the sociopolitical damage of moving away from Apache. It&rsquo;s not about him.</p>

<p>Hey, the font designers released their stuff under the Apache licence, so that once was their wish too.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that there are lots of type designers who later regret a contract they signed or a licence they gave out to anyone. But hey, so what. Everybody should consider the consequences of their action at the right time. E.g. I remember a tweet from some Google web font designer who wasn&rsquo;t pleased his font now was available in Google docs, or perhaps you heard Erik Spiekermann mention he can&rsquo;t get out of his contract for ITC Officina.</p>
<p>BTW <a href="http://www.kutilek.de/tmp/apachefonts.zip">here&rsquo;s a ZIP file</a> of all the fonts that Google offers right now under the Apache licence. There are some nice fonts in it, like Open Sans or the Droid fonts.</p>
<p>And what Té said. My guess would be that at least some open source font designers may be open to offer their fonts under a different – even propietary – licence when you ask them nicely or make them a monetary offer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Armenian - a decade is a morning stretch.  :-)</p>
<p>Jens, well expressed.
Regret is a very educational emotion.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for that zip!
Are there many more non-Google Apache fonts? BTW currently I would like to find all the monospaced Apache fonts.</p>
<p>But about getting a designer to offer a more strict license:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s exactly the same font as is available more freely, would that really work out? Considering -as we seem to agree- that this stuff is not retroactive (more below).</li>
<li>If the more free license does not allow something, is the original designer nonetheless allowed to over-ride that? That would actually be an incentive to release an OFL font: get people hooked on your design, then make money on commissioned mods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two more questions for Dave:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the designer of a free/libre font changes his mind, do you think people should respect that decision and stop using the free/libre version?</li>
<li>Can you cite actual cases of an Apache font being re-released under a stricter license?</li>

<p>With regards to re-licensing, you can always go more free, but you cannot go less free. Once you&rsquo;ve licensed something as BSD, for instance, you can&rsquo;t revoke that and make it GPL. You can fork it, or dual license it, or stop distributing it, but you cannot prevent someone else from redistributing or modifying their copy under the original license.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the specifics of the Apache license, but with MIT/BSD, you&rsquo;re explicitly allowed to re-license it however you want, provided you keep the original copyright stuff intact, but that only covers whatever copy you are distributing, not the originals.</p>

<p>Well, maybe you can go less free sometimes. What I mean is: sure, you can&rsquo;t stop people from hunting down and using the more free license from before you changed your mind, but you can reduce the number of places the more free license version is available, in favor of more places the less free license version is. You can also use guilt tripping (like Dave was trying :-) to reduce how often the more free license is actually&hellip; consummated.</p>

Do you think the first FAQ answer here

But from the perspective of a type designer who thinks freedom comes from <em>making</em> money, a more &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; license (like Apache) is great. And from the perspective of a <em>reader</em> of a minority script who wants to be free of mediocre fonts, a type designer taking advantage of an opportunistic license is great. Which brings me to a central issue: freedom isn&rsquo;t just about how many fonts you have and how little they cost you, it&rsquo;s also about quality.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Hey, the font designers released their stuff under the Apache licence, so that once was their wish too.</em></p>
<p>You may recall that a long time ago GWF offered the ability to donate money to font designers. The OFL forbids &lsquo;selling the font by itself&rsquo; and so I arranged a deal with a few designers to use Apache (the only other license (modulo the UFL for Ubuntu fonts which is an anomaly) so that GWF could have the option to sell their fonts as fonts; it would probably been a &lsquo;pay what you wish before downloading&rsquo; thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s experiment is now long gone, so the designers want to switch to OFL.</p>
<p><em>I have a feeling that there are lots of type designers who later regret a contract they signed or a licence they gave out to anyone. But hey, so what. Everybody should consider the consequences of their action at the right time.</em></p>
<p>Indeed. ;)</p>
<p><em>E.g. I remember a tweet from some Google web font designer who wasn&rsquo;t pleased his font now was available in Google docs,</em></p>
<p>Hmm, I seem to have missed that one. I know Toshi Omagari tweeted surprise about Tangerine appearing in Adobe Edge Web Fonts, but I explained things and he was happy.</p>
<p><em> or perhaps you heard Erik Spiekermann mention he can&rsquo;t get out of his contract for ITC Officina.</em></p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not familiar with this. Whats the story? :)</p>
<p><em>most Apache fonts are relatively old, supporting your view that designers no longer like it.</em></p>
<p>They always preferred OFL.</p>
<p><em> The big exception Roboto. I wonder why (not a rhetorical question).</em></p>
<p>Everything in AOSP is Apache, modulo the Linux kernel which is an anomaly.</p>
<p><em>Are there many more non-Google Apache fonts?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/noto">http://code.google.com/p/noto</a> is coming along.</p>
<p><em>If the more free license does not allow something, is the original designer nonetheless allowed to over-ride that? That would actually be an incentive to release an OFL font: get people hooked on your design, then make money on commissioned mods.</em></p>
<p>Yes, the original designer OWNS the rights and so can distribute copies under lots of different licenses. If you receive a copy, you are bound by the terms under which you received it; but those terms don&rsquo;t bind the copyright holder.</p>
<p>And yes, some designers who release OFL fonts are doing so as &lsquo;loss leaders&rsquo; for proprietary versions of the same fonts which are more complete - Ale Paul, for example - but Sorkin Type Co is running a better model I think; they are making the WEB fonts libre, and PRINT versions proprietary, so that the two are actually separate but intwined projects. That way, there isn&rsquo;t tension between community, libre progress and proprietary development.</p>
<p><em>If the designer of a free/libre font changes his mind, do you think people should respect that decision and stop using the free/libre version?</em></p>
<p>I want people to participate in libre culture because they genuinely think its a good idea. It seems a little mean to not respect their wishes.</p>
<p><em>Can you cite actual cases of an Apache font being re-released under a stricter license?</em></p>
<p>No. I can cite one case of an experienced type designer that wanted to rework a libre font, who ended up starting from scratch so the original license didn&rsquo;t apply anyway : <a href="http://www.anatoletype.net/fonts/dejarip">http://www.anatoletype.net/fonts/dejarip</a></p>
<p><em>Wait, I just realized that Abattis is Dave Crossland. All this time, and I never knew? Hi Dave.</em></p>
<p>Haha! Hi Dan :-)</p>
<p><em>With regards to re-licensing, you can always go more free, but you cannot go less free. Once you&rsquo;ve licensed something as BSD, for instance, you can&rsquo;t revoke that and make it GPL.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite sure you can take a BSD work as a piece of a larger work and make that overall work GPL, or proprietary.</p>
<p><em>You can fork it, or dual license it, or stop distributing it, but you cannot prevent someone else from redistributing or modifying their copy under the original license.</em></p>
<p>Not their copy, no, but another copy they get from you.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know the specifics of the Apache license, but with MIT/BSD, you&rsquo;re explicitly allowed to re-license it however you want</em></p>
<p>Kinda. You can&rsquo;t &lsquo;relicense&rsquo; it. You can distribute it under that license, which allows distributing it with additional restrictions. The GPL is more free because users can&rsquo;t be put under additional restrictions.</p>
<p><em>This licensing stuff sucks.</em></p>
<p>:)</p>
<p><em>Also, let&rsquo;s get a bit down-to-earth here: this
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Freedom_Law_Center">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Freedom_Law_Center</a>

<p>The FSF have been doing this for decades, and Haralde Welte has been doing his own GPL activism at <a href="http://gpl-violations.org">http://gpl-violations.org</a></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear about this much because the FSF&rsquo;s aim is software freedom through GPL compliance, not profits from lawsuits, so they quietly behind the scenes say, you could be sued for millions of dollars of copyright infringement, but we just want you to comply with the license which costs nothing. So they do that, instead.</p>
<p><em>their last action was over three years ago. Have people been behaving? That would be a first&hellip; Or maybe the SFLC ran out of cash.</em></p>
<p>By the look of it the last time I dropped by their office on Broadway in Manhatten, SFLC is financially buoyant. Think quiet settlements.</p>

<blockquote>the original designer OWNS the rights and so can distribute copies under lots of different licenses.</blockquote>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<blockquote>It seems a little mean to not respect their wishes.</blockquote>
<p>I agree it can be too opportunistic sometimes. But sometimes the OFL license is &ldquo;mean&rdquo; compared to the Apache one, for example when it reduces the quantity of quality fonts for a minority script. Considering the issue immediately above, that might often constitute locking out others with more time and/or ability to help a minority script just so the original designer can make more money. To me the needs of communities are more important than the desires of an individual. And these sorts of sentiments should in fact be integral to the spirit of open software, even though it might seem counter-intuitive sometimes (and sometimes it will in fact backfire).</p>
<blockquote><em>Can you cite actual cases of an Apache font being re-released under a stricter license?</em>
<p>No.</blockquote></p>
<p>This* does cast some doubt on your view that virtually all designers no longer like Apache. Certainly the near-hopelessness of enforcing a stricter license is a damper, but if people do expect their wishes to be respected (which is the first step to actually getting them respected :-) then the least they can do is revise the official position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not to mention the still-standing elephant in the room, Roboto.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Think quiet settlements.</blockquote>
<p>Somebody should work on making <em>that</em> more open. :-&gt;  Seriously, there&rsquo;s no greater deterrent than seeing other people punished for something you&rsquo;re considering doing.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I believe Apache is a more magnanimous license. Remember, you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to charge money for a derivative work, and there will always be some people who don&rsquo;t; but if -directly- making money is the only way a given individual would feel <em>free</em> taking part in open software, that ends up helping others too.</p>

<p>I have difficultly making sense out of this. In libre culture, making money is fine, selling copies is fine, but proprietary licensing is not fine. You seem to assert you can&rsquo;t make money with libre fonts. This isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

<p>Dave, you&rsquo;d previously said that virtually all designers are moving away from Apache and to OFL (or other resale-restrictive licenses). But why would &ldquo;big daddy&rdquo; Google switch Arimo, Cousine, and Tinos* from OFL to Apache? Coupled with Droid, Open Sans, and the telling recent Roboto and Noto being Apache, is it fair to say that Google itself prefers Apache?</p>

<p><em>- Does Apache not have any naming issues?</em></p>
<p>This depends on your perspective. If you want name control, Apache has naming issues because it doesn&rsquo;t have a RFN-like option. If you do not want name control, Apache has naming issues because it doesn&rsquo;t include trademark usage, so if the font name is trademarked, you&rsquo;ll need a separate agreement to use the trademark.</p>

To repeat: if being able to sell a modified libre font is the only way some people can justify making that thing, and thus help society by providing something of value which would otherwise not exist, that is social justice. Nobody is forced to buy the thing; anybody can get a free one if it exists (and if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, there&rsquo;s often a good reason).</p>
<p>The only people who benefit from preventing money-making from modified libre fonts (and not in all ways, mind you, since they&rsquo;re part of society/culture too) are graphic designers -and their clients- who refuse to pay for fonts. Pardon me while I don&rsquo;t mind.</p>

<p>I agree. However, I would argue that the modifications done automatically by web font services are not improvements. Occasionally there will be rehinting, and that would be done specifically as an improvement. But it is not standard for most of them/us.</p>
<p>(Funny, the original text is no longer in the thread. I suspect Abattis edited the blurb that Quadibloc was responding to, probably to clarify. I have no disagreement with the edited version.)</p>

<p>While the something has utility value and that helps society, since it tramples the freedom of its users, it harms society. Depending on one&rsquo;s personal order of values, one may conclude social justice is being increased or decreased; and we seem to order our values differently. :-)</p>
