  body: "What do you mean by \"does not work\"? Just that the application does not
    see the font? If so, that may be a naming problem. With FontBook, select your
    font and type \"cmd I\" to get the information on it. You should then get its
    Postscript name, its Full name, its Family and its Style. \r\n\r\nThe font is
    called using the Family and the Style in textEdit and PhotoShop. \r\n\r\nIt is
    called with its Full name in Word and Microsoft applications. \r\n\r\nIt can be
    accessed in various ways in XeTeX. I don't know about Flash. I could even manage
    to fix a third name for InkScape (using the so-called fields \"WSS Family\" and
    \"WSS Subfamily\") and InkScape would only want to use that name, none of the
    others.\r\n\r\n"
