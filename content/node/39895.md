  body: And just clarity's sake, isn't this Art Nouveau, rather than Art Deco?

  body: "I also think this owe's something to the type that Dave Nalle's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/abaddon/\">'Abaddon'</a>
    was modeled after, which was drawn by Alex Jay as an Art Nouveau-like face for
    a book about Dinosaurs by William Stout in 1981. Jay says his lettering was inspired
    by the work of Alphonse Mucha, one of the greats of the Art Nouveau movement.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks all, yes I meant to say art nouveau -- I'd been searching fonts for
    so long my keywords were keywording themselves.\r\n\r\nAbaddon was my jumping
    off point when I was searching for something similar.  Looks like it'll be a calligraphy
    project and not an Adobe Illustrator one."
