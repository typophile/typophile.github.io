  We\u2019re switching to a font that includes case-sensitive forms of the opening
  question and exclamation marks. Since we\u2019re trying to follow Spanish typographic
  standards, rather than imposing (North American) English norms, I decided to use
  them.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that in good, pre-digital Spanish typography it
  was standard to use opening marks that extend from the base-line to cap height before
  capitals and marks that extend from the descent to the x height before lower case
  letters. Failure to do this became acceptable with the advent of the typewriter
  and continued with electronic typesetting, where, originally, case-sensitive forms
  were available, if at all, in expert sets that most people didn\u2019t have or didn\u2019t
  care to use. In other words, case-sensitive forms are standard in good typography;
  not using them is typical of bad typography.\r\n\r\nMy manager has been told that
  this is just not true. \"Raised\" opening punctuation before capitals should not
  be used.\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm either of these positions? (While I have my opinion,
  I don\u2019t mind being wrong. I\u2019m just looking for clear guidance.)"

    questionmark/exclam with upper and lower case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way to
    determine the norm would be to get a selection of Spanish daily papers, and see
    what they do.\r\n\r\nBoth Georgia and Verdana have these characters raised as
    default (and perhaps other MS faces, I haven't checked). It's traditionally incorrect,
    of course, but one hell of a precedent.\r\n\r\nPreviously discussed here:\r\nhttp://dev.typophile.com/node/34363"
