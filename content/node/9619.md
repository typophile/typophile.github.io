  body: I think that it is Neil Bold, don&#39;t know if it is digitized but <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000016"
    target=_top>Mobley</a> is based on Neil &#40;scroll down&#41; and could be a good
    solution if you don&#39;t find it.

  body: It once was something like Neil Bold, but it has been grossly distorted. OptiFonts
    has a digitial version as discussed on <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65618.html"
    target="_blank">this thread</a>. It is closer to the original than Mobley, which
    just claims to be &#39;inspired&#39; by it. Note that there is some doubt about
    which name OptiFonts used. It may have been &#39;Natty&#39;, based on information
    in one font file I saw.
