  body: The lettering on the second banner IS beautiful, but I&#39;m more fascinated
    by the vertical proportion variances you pointed out on the first sample. Why
    do you think this was done? Was it assumed to be  natural proportion based on
    the proportions found in Farsi script? Ir was it simply decorative? <BR> <BR>I
    turn specifically back to Hrant as one of our resident experts in non-Latin letterforms
    &#40;or, now, &#34;non-non-Latin&#34; letterforms.... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    since the Farsi lettering is very well done &#40;assuming the same person did
    both&#41;, and since it really is pretty consistent &#40;only one errant &#34;el&#34;
    and one errant &#34;y&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s interesting that letters that
    [normally] fit in the x-height follow the x-height, but those with extenders have
    their x-heights reduced. Kinda like Fleischmann... :-&#41; The only exception
    is &#34;o&#34;, and that might be the influence of the &#34;sekoon&#34;: a small
    circular floating mark in the Arabic script, used to denote the absense of a [short]
    vowel. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Especially the first example.  I guess that&#39;s what you get when someone
    tries to write in an unfamiliar system.  It&#39;s almost child like, but more
    sophisticated, if you can say that when you call something child like.

    counters are roughly the same size. We&#39;re used to the <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>
    being the same height, but the guiding principle in this banner seems to be that
    the enclosed counter of the two letters should be visually balanced.

  body: '&#62; 22 of the 28 arabic letters have 4 variants <BR> <BR>And the remaining
    6 only have two: they don&#39;t join on the left &#40;leading&#41; side no matter
    where they are in a word. Also: Arabic has no caps. <BR> <BR>David&#39;s example
    #1 probably has linguistic validity, but it might confuse some people: those two
    are actually different letters. <BR> <BR>And in example #2, the &#34;lone&#34;
    &#40;more conventionally called &#34;independent&#34;&#41; form of the letter
    yaa&#39; &#40;the first letter in &#34;yawm&#34;/day&#41; is missing the two lower
    dots. <BR> <BR>&#62; short vowles are not written <BR> <BR>Yes, that&#39;s an
    important distinction: <i>long</i> vowels are very much written. Also, short vowels
    are also written out in texts meant for learning to read Arabic, as well as when
    they&#39;re required to clear up a serious ambiguity &#40;rare&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    feature of Arabic that you can dump part of the script when it&#39;s no longer
    needed&#42; is enviable - although in the West it&#39;s usually portrayed as a
    negative. Another positive feature of Arabic that tends to be distorted into a
    negative is that it appears &#34;too small&#34; on the body, while in reality
    it&#39;s simple using the Cartesian space differently than Latin, in fact more
    efficiently in terms of readability &#40;but not legibility&#41;. Latin is great
    for posters. Which makes sense when you consider that its [most relevant] origins
    are in large public inscriptions. <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that Arabic can do this
    only because it&#39;s a consonantal language - you couldn&#39;t apply the exact
    same system to an Indo-European language. <BR> <BR>&#62; in ISAREL YOU HAVE TO
    STUDY ENGLISH, ARABIC, FRENCH <BR> <BR>Unless I&#39;m mistaked, you don&#39;t
    really <i>have</i> to study French, and I&#39;d be suprised if Arabic was really
    required either. In comparison, in Lebanon &#40;where both Arabic and French are
    official languages&#41;, if you&#39;re Armenian, you end up with a requirement
    of 4 languages! That&#39;s because when it comes to English, you do practically
    <i>have</i> to learn it pretty much anywhere!  :-/ <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m pretty
    sure Chris was talking about <i>my</i> images&#42;, especially since you hadn&#39;t
    been able to show us yours when he made that remark! But it&#39;s interesting
    that Chris seemed too busy feeling offended to realize it was just a misunderstanding.
    I&#39;m just happy there&#39;s no land at stake... <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, Chris,
    I don&#39;t think the &#34;non-Farsi&#34; example is nice at all, it&#39;s the
    &#34;non-Urdu&#34; one that I find stellar. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; the guiding
    principle in this banner seems to be that the enclosed counter of the two letters
    should be visually balanced. <BR> <BR>Interesting observation. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
    <BR>&#62; One would assume that if they had studied English, their writing would
    be better <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s no definite point where you either know it
    or not, it&#39;s a continuum. Examples: <BR>1&#41; The people who made Yakout
    &#40;the first Simplified Arabic typeface&#42;&#41; knew the Arabic script very
    well, but they still managed to deface it. <BR>2&#41; Calligraphers consider people
    like me &#40;with lousy handwriting&#41; insufficiently educated in the making
    of letters. <BR>So it&#39;s a question of context. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?NID=2930"
