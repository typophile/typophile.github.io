body: Searching for a font that conveys movement or mobility for a technology company.
  My first thought was to use an oblique or italic typeface, but it's an obvious and
  expected solution. And it tends to look too sporty or automotive (nascar). There
  there might be something a little more subtle, yet distinctive. Any ideas would
  be greatly appreciated.
