  was \r\nwondering if anybody has a pdf file of an original American newspaper, \r\nthat
  was ment for printing, photo's and ads included.\r\nit does'nt matter from which
  date the paper comes.\r\nIt is part of a case study for turning a book into a paper,
  and in reverse.\r\nAlso the thematics play a large role. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
