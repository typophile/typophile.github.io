body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\ni am currently working on revamping a corporate A4 newsletter
  that has been badly designer by non designers. The newsletter is for a national
  \ petroleum retailing company, \r\nTheir logo is set in avant garde and their corprate
  typeface is Avant Garde Medium and Bold.\r\n\r\ni have complete freedom to do whatever
  i want as the company is totally clueless in terms of design so i really want to
  try something new.\r\n\r\nI have experimented using avant garde as body text and
  also quite liked DIN but my only concern is legibily because the newsletter is quite
  text heavy i need to set it at a small point size.\r\n\r\nI am looking to make the
  newletters, modern, clean and elegant but i want to referenace its industrial roots.
  any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Also, any suggestons for
  what text to use for the headline? many thanx"

    legibility is a point."

  body: "Point well taken. Student does not necessarily equal clueless. The fact that
    you are here asking for advice over-rides the naivity in thinking Avant Garde
    is suitable for text. But I work at a place where the \"professional designers\"
    think Century Gothic is a good text face in print and web. (Compare AG and CG
    and you will see they are very similar).\r\n\r\nA good starting point is to determine
    the type of message that you want the newsletter to take. Is it to be formal and
    old-school business, or more modern and up to date? Do they want to convey a feeling
    of \"green\" which many petroleum companies think they can pull off?\r\n\r\nOnce
    you have set down your parameters, then you can delve more wisely in the choice
    of typeface and format."

    that you are giving. i can tell i will be learning alot from here in the future.\r\n\r\n>Dom:
    I would like the newsletter to have a modern and up to date feel, without being
    boring and too 'corporate'. At the moment the newsletter looks like its targeting
    10 year olds!!! so there is a lot of work to be done!\r\n\r\n>Nick:  i was briefed
    that the clients themselves are totally confused about content, they have no sense
    of order ie. they tend to slap things on on whatever page they wish. They dont
    even stick to their brand guidelines! This is what ive been told by people who
    did work for them first hand. So i basically have free reign to do whatever i
    want but i want to be in keeping with their clean and elegant image that they
    try to convey ( sometimes successfully and sometimes not so) so in that respect
    i want to adhere to the corporate standard, definately.\r\n\r\n>Bert: Im on it!
    Sifting thru the stuff i have at home at the mo. just really stuck with typography,
    an area i need to practice more often. like i said its quite text heavy and im
    finding it challenging fitting a lot of different info on an a4 format.\r\n"

  body: "> They dont even stick to their brand guidelines!\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean
    that you shouldn't, if they were developed by a professional. They might give
    you a solid starting point on your exploration.\r\n\r\n> without being boring
    \r\n\r\nBoring to whom? Designers worried about being boring are the reason that
    work gets set in Comic Sans, one of the least boring typefaces around. Hopefully
    you are well past that stage.\r\n\r\nBut I never consider \"being boring\" to
    be a deficiency. A designer is basically a problem solver. You need to determine
    what the problems are in the work, and then prepare something that will solve
    the problem. If boring is the only problem, then there is not much to do. It sounds
    to me like there is much more here that you have to solve.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanx don! i appreciate your comments. ive re-read the brand guidelines and
    have made a few typefaces choices.\r\n\r\nthe brand's image drivers: Young, Energetic.\r\na
    few keywords used to describe the brand:  Trustworthy, Innovative, Fast\r\n\r\nI
    have chosen frutiger for the headline+bodytext as i like the wide range of weights
    available and that it is clean, simple and does not distract from content.  im
    setting the headlines in italics ( to reference movement,innovation,speed) and
    the body text in regular. im hoping that would creating a touch of dynamism in
    the text. also the newsletter is text heavy so frutiger seems to work as well
    in regards to legibility as small as 9 pt.\r\n\r\nthe title of the newsletter
    i have thought about setting in clarendon for these reasons: \r\n\r\na) the newsletter
    is for an arabic oil company, therefore i felt that the serifs work beautifully
    in hinting a calligraphic touch whilst still remaining contemporary\r\n\r\nb)
    the newsletter will be read internally only. again the masthead set in clarendon
    i feel will appear inviting, friendly and familiar.\r\n\r\naltho it is a corporate
    newsletter i feel the masthead provides a humanistic touch, making it less intimidating
    and more approachable.\r\n\r\nif you guys have any other typeface suggestions
    or comments, id love to hear them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    You are certain that they don't know what they want. But are you certain on what
    you -REALLY- want? Be more specific, it's one way to start and tell your client
    what you can bring to their table."
