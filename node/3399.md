  but it&#39;s unlikely that I will ever be of use as a type identifier.  Nonetheless,
  I hope you can help me with my sample. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a bit grainy.  I&#39;m
  interested in finding a freeware typeface to simulate that used for &#34;Boy Scouts
  of America.&#34; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27622.jpg"

  body: Thanks for your suggestions and regards.  My trip was mediocre.  &#40;The
    in-flight meal was pasty, but I had a window seat.&#41; <BR> <BR>Tinplate Titling
    looks like it will do the trick, but I&#39;m happy to have been directed to Roskell.  Thanks
    again. <BR>
