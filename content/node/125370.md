body: i'm working on a magazine layout, part of a series with a consistent aesthetic.
  The previous designer got busy and couldn't do the layout this time, so i'm the
  new guy. The problem is, i have to re-create the entire layout from scratch. i'm
  reasonably certain i've correctly identified all the fonts, but this one is stumping
  me. It looks a lot like Futura, except for the ligature in the percent symbol. The
  odd thing is, i went looking for it on MyFonts, and due to some glitch, the attached
  sample appeared in place of another, completely different font. So it took a screenshot,
  and fed it back into MyFonts' WhatTheFont utility, whereupon it could return no
  close matches. Obviously the font is in their database, otherwise it wouldn't have
  displayed at all. Anybody have any ideas?
