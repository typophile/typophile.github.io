  of the best actually.\r\n\r\nAnyways..I need a font ID..it's a classic font that
  was widely used in the 80's.  NWA and Eazy-E always used it on there album titles
  and logos.\r\n\r\nI need it for a shirt design I am doing, but I can't seem to find
  it. I think it is a free font, but I can't download it until I find the name of
  it.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://www.dustygroove.com/images/products/n/nwa~~~~~~~~_straighto_101b.jpg>"
