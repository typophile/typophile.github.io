body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>If you taek a stroll on to <a href="http://www.1001fonts.com"
  target="_blank">www.1001fonts.com</a> and do a search for a typeface called &#34;Pill
  Popper&#34; you should find that it has no uppercase letters. <BR> <BR>I created
  this during my college/uni years and never got around to doing the uppercase. It&#39;s
  downloadable as a TTF only - I created it with some cheap program called Font Creator
  Program v4 &#40;original, eh?!?&#41; which did me well back then. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
  I thought some of you geniuses might feel the urge to give it some uppercase siblings.
  I&#39;ve not got much time to do them so maybe someone out there can. <BR> <BR>If
  someone does finish the font off - let me know,and I&#39;ll amend the download on
  the site with the new font and the your name/details! <BR>Cheers!
