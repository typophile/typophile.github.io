  body: Assuming calligraphy as the spring of typography, in old-style typefaces (used
    as fonts) text figures are usually the same height as a lowercase x, they are
    not capitals, nor uncial, they are 'minuscule'. The ductus is the number, direction
    and sequence of the strokes that makes up a character. These days, some typefaces
    intended for text even make old-style figures the default numerals. FontShop,
    for example, usually makes old-style figures the default; Adobe doesn't. But it
    can vary from font to font.

    not as settled those as of the roman letters. And so the designer has a little
    more latitude with them. \r\n\r\nIn Paul Shaw's 'letter tour' of lower Manhattan
    that I went on a month ago we saw a lot of stone carved letters where eg, 1931
    had only the 9 descending, not the 3. There were a number like this, with other
    letters same height on the top and the 9 descending. They were perfectly readable
    and didn't look odd; in fact many were quite nice. \r\n\r\nObviously a lot has
    to do with context. If you have an old style font, not following the convention
    for text figures is going to look out of place. But eg in an address or date or
    more modern face variations may look good.    "

    is important to me to understand.\r\n\r\nAnyone here who is inclinded to care
    knows that my most traditional fonts are pretty 'out there'; most are far past
    that. Nevertheless, I try to borrow legibilty and other tricks from the classical
    camp, so that the fonts can offer more utility than most display styles.\r\n\r\nIn
    this case, I'm working on a postmodern tall rectangular face with just enough
    ornamentation to seem... retro? It's a gift for my wife. Line figures were boring,
    text figures seem to both read better and add to the plyfulness intended. So,
    I've arranged the letters into the traditional lining, then fiddled with it very
    slightly. The current arangement <em>seems</em> to be classical, except the 4
    sits on the baseline.\r\n\r\nChoz Cunningham\r\n!Exclamachine Type Foundry\r\nhttp://www.exclamachine.com"

    to which people are referring. The ascending 5 can look pretty cool and -- more
    to the point -- quite normal in some typefaces. My own opinion is that the figures
    should be made to blend in pleasantly with the text, and that is much more tricky
    than just following rules. Really, a lot of non-lining figures look bad because
    the designer just \"made the 4 descend\" without considering how it harmonizes
    with text. (I've had my own trouble with this very thing, so I sympathize.) I
    also am always interested to see cases of \"semi-lining\" figures and other strange
    hybrids. They can be educational case-studies about what works and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to see an interesting real-world case, check out the changes in the non-lining
    figures between the original, Type 1 version of Utopia, and the figures in the

    and descenders. Second, seeing that the terminals on the 6 and 9 would get crowded
    with the heavy strokes of the eye of the 6 and 9. Hence the idea of using a pointed
    terminal to reduce crowding. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the 235 you have the ball terminals
    opposite a thin part, so they don't crowd so much, meaning put too much weight
    together. And an important part of the 'look' of Utopia comes from the ball terminals
    on the a and c. The ball terminals on the 235 echo and reinforce this, particularly
    on text figures, which will go with the lower case. Also if you change 235 you
    probably have to change them on the lining figures, and further lose harmony with
    the face. \r\n\r\nHence this compromise to achieve the goal of making the text
    figures more compact."

  body: "<cite>Christopher, why do you think the ball terminals were removed on the
    6/9?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe theories above are as good as any. I remember talking with
    Robert about it at the time he made the changes, but I don't remember him explaining
    that. (Which is not to say I didn't just forget!)\r\n\r\nWhat's most interesting
    to me is that there is an overall improvement -- in that the figures just harmonize
    with the text more. Utopia is a good case for the this particular thread, I think,
    because the original figures always struck me as a little forced; they conform
    to the rules of how non-lining figures should be, but they were perhaps lacking
    design maturity, and never looked comfortable to me. Robert has learned a lot
    about such things since the early days when he made Utopia, so I think it's reflected
    in the changes. The figures are, overall, a bit smaller in scale, and all the
    ascending and descending figures don't look so stretched out. The proportions
    of each shape are more pleasant.\r\n\r\nAnyone designing non-lining figures who
    thinks, \"Just change the 3 to align with the lowercase x-height and descender
    height\" might also take some time to actually <em>look</em> at the results. It's
    often not so simple.\r\n\r\nOf course the other thing going on with Utopia, I
    think, is that it's a sort of transitional-modern, and non-lining figures just
    don't always work as well with such designs. I use Utopia Std for a newsletter
    I make, and I think the lining figures work better -- so as much as I love Utopia,
    I still am hesitant to use its non-lining figures.\r\n\r\nProbably this is why
    such typefaces -- used so often for magazines and such -- often have more diminutive
    lining figures or some hybrid. There is less tradition with these more modern
    styles, and they often benefit from more experimental approaches, at least for
    type designers with good eyes who are willing to look and think about it."
