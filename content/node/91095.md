    files with the following extensions may be uploaded: <em>jpg jpeg gif png txt
    html doc xls pdf ppt swf pps</em>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nNothing has changed. I
    could transfer a pdf that is less than 128K. I tried a larger one (192 K) and
    got this\r\n \r\n<img src=\"/files/error_52397.jpg\"> \r\n\r\nI inserted that
    image with\r\n<PRE>\r\n&lt;img src=\"../../files/error_52397.jpg\"&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhere
    the link is one of the attachments above.\r\n\r\nPS I changed for &nbsp;<code>&lt;img
    src=\"/files/error_52397.jpg\"&gt;</code>, &nbsp; which is probably better."

  body: "When you are logged in, you click on \"My blog\" at the top right, then you
    click on \"Post new blog entry\" (at the top) and you just choose some file to
    attach (at the bottom) and save. The file is then on the typophile server. If
    you uploaded <code>filename.png</code>, then inserting <code>&lt;img src=\"/files/filename.png\"&gt;</code>
    in some thread will display it.\r\n\r\nNote that you can edit your blog (there
    is a button for that at the top) and then make new attachments."

  body: Well, insert image is now back. So what I wrote above is no longer useful
    for image files.

  body: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_notation"><strong>Dirac notation</strong></a>
    for Quantum mechanics comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac"><strong>Paul
    Dirac</strong></a> (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1933). The font used here is Fourier
    Math, a mathematical font made to complement Adobe Utopia for writing mathematical
    texts (which I do on a daily basis). The avatar reads "ket psi".
