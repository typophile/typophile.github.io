<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Thanks, everyone, for your input on my last typeface, Metron. As promised, I'll be sending out finished-version copies soon to everyone who helped. <br> <br>Anyway, this is my second font-making foray, and though it looks at first glance like a geometric sans serif, the curves and nuances on this one are decidedly un-geometric. <br> <br>My inspirations were the Canon EOS logo and Oban (from this forum). I wanted to make something solid and modern to be usable as a substitute for overused fonts like Handel Gothic. <br> <br>At this point, I only have the capitals and numerals. I'm dissatisfied with a few letters, particularly the W. Any help is appreciated. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4793.gif alt="Epoch version 0.1"> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Epoch PDF<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/epoch_v01-4794.pdf target=_blank><b>epoch_v01.pdf</b></a> (27.4 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul <br> <br>I liked very much your work with metron, and here you have a nice work too. <br> <br>I think that "W" and "M" looks to tight, and that makes them look too heavy, see the diference of weight betwen "W" and "X". <br> <br>the "7" is too heavy on top, i would try to move the descender a little bit to he left. <br> <br>I think something is wrong with the "B" and "S", but i don't know what. <br> <br>the "Y" needs more space betwen the "head and the tail". <br> <br>i think the horizontal in the center of the "R" shouldn't be curvy. <br> <br>i don't get use to the "6" and the "9", but i think they would work right. <br> <br>i love "C" , "A", "D", "X" and "E" <br> <br>very nice work <br> <br>CG</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I wanted to make something solid and modern to be <br>usable as a substitute for overused fonts like Handel Gothic.</i> <br> <br>This is an excellent goal, Paul. You're on your way to <br>achieving it. <br> <br>Cristian is right about the 'Y'. But I recognize your problem - <br>you were obviously trying to keep the middle bar consistent <br>on the 'Y' and 'R'. But the higher bars on the 'A' 'B' 'E' work <br>fine so there is room to raise it on the 'Y'. Or, are you <br>opposed to a descender? <br> <br>Consistent widths is a definite issue here. In addition to <br>Cristian's comments, I'll add that the 'J' seems too wide and <br>the 'H' too narrow. <br> <br>The 'H' also feels too straight with the flat ends. I wonder if <br>there's a way to give them an angle as on the 'A' and 'N'. <br>See if you can make it happen without a Hobo effect. <br> <br>The 'B' and 'S' look fine to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is rockin'. I'd agree with Stephen that the 'J' seems too wide - maybe it should be more along the lines of 'L.' I might say too that the 'T' feels a bit too straight. Also, much like the 'Y,' the '2' seems too have some quirky proportions because of the middle bar or spine. <br> <br>I wonder if modeling the 'W' after conjoined 'U's insteaded of 'V's might be worth trying. Or perhaps modifying a rotated 'E.' <br> <br>Love the 'Q' and the 'X' is great.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps it's silly, but I like 'X' because - on my screen anyway - it appears to have nice subtle curves to it. Which keep it from being too straight (e.g., 'H' & 'T') and without, as Stephen warns, turning into Hobo. <br> <br>The more I look, the more I think the leg on 'R' sticks out a bit far to the right. <br> <br>Cheers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great start with this one, Paul. I just wish it would be finished because I'm working on a project that would benefit fom it... damm my bad luck! :-) <br> <br>In my opinion it has a great personality but it suffers from the same problems other monospaced fonts do when used in big sizes.

<div class=commentbody><i>My inspirations were the Canon EOS logo and Oban (from this forum). I wanted to make something solid and modern to be usable as a substitute for overused fonts like Handel Gothic.</i> <br> <br>Nice. I'd say goal accomplished. I agree with the comments so far. I really like the uniqueness of the <i>9</i> Could this somehow be used to solve the problem with the <i>Y</i>? I don't think you are the only designer to ever have problems designing a <i>W</i>. As your <i>V</i> is so wide, maybe too wide, I think you could make the <i>W</i> a little wider and perhaps add some air. And perhpaps round the corners on that apex? <br> <br>Nice though. Where was this when I was forced to use Handel Gothic? <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, great stuff. <br> <br>The glyphs that bother me are: <br>K - The join looks funny. Maybe you should stagger the arms. <br>M - Looks too stiff. <br>W - Too closed and narrow. <br>X - Same problem as the "K", plus too wide. <br>7 - Try making the spine like the "2". <br> <br>Accents: the tilde is too big, the rest too small. <br> <br>There's also some color issues, like the "N" is too dark, and the Section too light. <br> <br>The Pilcrow rules. As for the Yen, you should ask a Japanese guy, but it seems too cramped - maybe reduce the bowl, or use one bar. The Euro I think needs longer bars. <br> <br>Keep it up! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul, your Polish <i>ew</i> (Lslash) is pretty good: the bar crosses the stem at just the right height and has a really good length. I would probably increase the angle off the horizontal just a bit more though. Since you've done such a good job with this diacritic letter, I really encourage you to do the rest of the Polish letters and extend the languagre coverage for the central European, Baltic and Turkish character sets. I think you would have a lot of fun doing this, and would increase the value of the font.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Karen, John, Yves et al. <br> <br>John: I'm happy you like my <i>ew</i>. I studied them for some time to figure out the positioning, but I agree about the angle. <br> <br>I'd actually like to do not only more Latin language coverage, but perhaps some other scripts. I've already sketched out Thai letters, just to see how it might work.
