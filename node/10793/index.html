<div class=commentbody>In the early 90s, Adobe came out with packages of typefaces that were aimed at general consumers. Aside from Image Club and Fontek disks (if you could find them), these were the only collections that were affordable for students/nonprofessionals at that time. As a result, Industria, Arcadia, Lithos, Copperplate and Tekton were absolutely everywhere. More recently -- for me, anyway -- it's been Bell Gothic and Avenir all over the place. <br> <br>Most noticeable for me: I can't go to a video store without being bombarded by Trajan. Any shelf you look at in the drama/action/suspense sections, you'll see it on at least 5-10 video boxes. Even if movies don't use it for the logo, they still use it as the headline font for all the review quotes. (Super-secret project to come on just this subject.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>At present, Spumoni. It's the new Comic Sans. Nationally, KFC uses it in their print (and I know I've seen it elsewhere). Regionally, at least one chain of grocery stores uses it and locally? You can't turn the page in the newspaper without seeing it in 9 out of ten ads, every feature article that requires a novelty headline... eeagh. It's so lively and annoying, like the pesky little brother you can't get rid of.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Speaking of O.D'ing on one face, if you haven't seen the movie "Royal Tennenbaums," there's a funny running type gag in the movie: every written object you see, from signage to magazines to hand-written signs, is in Futura. It's everywhere -- creating a surreally uniform and bland environment. (I like Futura, but not that much.) Partly as an experiment, I ask non-design folks who've seen the movie if they noticed the consistent typeface use. So far no one has. </div>

<div class=commentbody>That's part of the art direction subtlety that makes Wes <br>Anderson's fims so great.

<div class=commentbody>I think it's rather incredible (if it's true) that Anderson <br>used Renner Bold instead of Futura Bold.

<div class=commentbody>Karen, <br>I am now traumatized by the thought of the schools with the giant Comic Sans signs! Those poor students, I predict bad things in their future. <br> <br>On a related note (sort of), when I was in elementary school, around age 8, the school commissioned and installed an outdoor sculpture in the Mondrian / Doesburg / de Stijl vein. It was about 10 feet tall and consisted of a 3-dimensional black metal rectilinear framework and flat metal primary-colored panels. It was basically like Doesburg designed a jungle gym -- really cool looking and the kids were allowed to climb around on it. I thought it was great. Then a group of parents started making noise about the school not being traditional enough in its teaching methods. The administration responded in part by removing the sculpture ("too weird" I guess?) and hauling it off never to be seen again. What was it replaced by? Nothing but the hole in the concrete -- the art budget was spent and gone. I knew at that tender age that I needed to get the hell out of that burg. <br>Oy.</div>
