  find the font that best buy uses in all their ads, posters, and on their website.
  I'd love some input as to what this font is, so that I can track it down, and use
  it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bestbuy font_5728.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am particularly interested in the (bold?) font at the beginning- the part that says
  \"NO INTEREST\". Any input, or identification is much appreciated."

    if you really want to get a good look before trackin' it down.
