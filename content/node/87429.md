  body: "if a single licensed unit cost is \xA4100\r\n\r\nwhat would a license for
    20,000 users be in line with industry standards?"

  body: 'I''m not sure there are industry standards for this calculation. With other
    software, it''s typically called a ''site license'' where the corporation buys
    a license for use by any/all of its employees. But not all software does this.
    So, sometimes they''d simply charge for the price * 20,000. Sometimes they may
    give a quantity discount. Sometimes they do a flat fee for the entire company.
    Sometimes they do a smaller flat fee, then an annual per-user license fee. '

  body: The MyFonts standard model for this amount of users has a 95% multi-user discount,
    which means 20000 licenses costs 900 times the amount of a single user license
