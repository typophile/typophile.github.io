body: "When I showed my monospace at the Typecon typecrit one of the items that was
  brought up was the punctuation. The suggestion was made that I more fully tune the
  shapes to the letterforms. I am realizing Now I am starting to reconsider it's design
  and I am interested in:\r\n\r\n- which fonts' punctuation you admire and why\r\n-
  things you may have noticed or learned about the relationship between the design
  of letters and of punctuation\r\n- the way in which a font being a monospace impacts
  the design punctuation - things like the need for a mono's punctuation to fill a
  little bit more space than normal and the need for it to be a bit heavier than normal
  as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know what your intention for the font is, but as a programmer, who
    uses monospaced fonts daily, I'll put my two cents in. I feel most monospaced
    fonts fail bacause of their punctuation. One of the reasons I think Monaco works
    so well is it's punctuation is clear but not overpowering, it's well balanced
    with the alphanumeric characters. ProFont's punctuation is too dark, it overpowers
    the characters, although it does have a large following. I would like the new
    Microsoft programming font by Luc(us) de Groot except for the double bowl \"g\"
    which bothers me. The punctuation marks have a nice balance but I feel they need
    a bit more height. \r\n\r\nChuck"

    punctuation is too dark </cite>\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\nI have some questions if you
    don't mind:\r\n\r\n<cite> the double bowl \u201Cg\u201D </cite>\r\nAre you against
    them in general, or just in mono's? Also, can you imagine one that you could like
    or not really? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat size do you use your mono at & at what screen
    rez? What OS? With or without smoothing?\r\n\r\nDo you care about print at all?\r\n\r\nCarl
    Crossgrove gave me some great tips today and pointed me at the punctuation in
    the Adobe Pro sets. Very Useful! \r\n\r\nI am still interested in hearing more."

    double bowl \"g,\" there are some beautiful double bowled \"g\"s, but in a font
    for programming, at least in my opinion, it's a little distracting. Just as in
    reading a book you want the type to be pleasing, even interesting, but not distracting.\r\n\r\nMonaco
    is a Mac font, it was one of the original set of \"city fonts.\" I usually use
    it at 9pt (not smoothed), sometimes at 12pt (smoothed).\r\n\r\nPrinting is not
    a big concern for me. That said, Consolas looks better in print then Monaco."

  body: "Interesting that two programmers posted here. I'm not a programmer by trade,
    but have hacked away at more than a few manuals, and have to agree that the use
    of monospace to represent code is an important application. (When you have monospaced
    code, then the characters line up correctly in columns ... assuming a monospaced
    editor font ... this allows easier checking for typos ... if the columns aren't
    correct, you have missed a character earlier in a line.)\r\n\r\nFor programming
    it is important that characters don't look the same. One and ell, zero an letter
    Oh, period and comma, colon and semi colon, all should be distinct from one another
    at small sizes. The damned code won't run if you switch the characters."

  body: "<cite> at least in my opinion, it\u2019s a little distracting. </cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    very interesting. With the 'g' the tension I feel is between distraction which
    I agree the double bowl can create, and distinctiveness which the the double bowl
    has more of. My goal is make a double bowl that retains the former without too
    much of the the first. I find that reading with double bowl 'g's works better
    for me but I don't know if it's better in coding or not. \r\n\r\nThe one thing
    I have noticed is that programmers feel very strongly about these things. But
    they don't all agree at all. The one thing I would really like to have - serious
    survey of preferences doesn't seem to exist. Perhaps I can get slahdot or somebody
    to make a survey. Maybe we could host it ( we have the ability here) & get publicity
    for it in the relevant places. I'd better see how they feel at Punchcut first
    though. If they agree my question would be - who would you ask to publicize the
    survey? Digg?\r\n\r\nPerhaps Microsoft has good data on this already & would be
    willing to share. \r\n\r\n<cite> two programmers</cite>\r\n\r\nOne actually! I
    design fonts."

  body: "I have made a request to Typophile to let me make a survey now. Perhaps it
    will work out. :-)\r\n\r\nHere are my proposed questions. Feel free to suggest
    others or to crit these:\r\n\r\n............\r\n\r\n[ Programmers and Monospace
    Users: Tell us about your Font preferences ]\r\n\r\nAre you a programmer?\r\n
    Yes; No\r\n\r\nAre your font options for programming?\r\n Very good; Okay; Not
    something I think about; Poor; Horrible\r\n\r\nDo you prefer Plain pixels or Aliasing/Smoothing?\r\n
    Plain pixels; Microsoft Cleartype; Microsoft Smoothing; Apple Smoothing\r\n\r\nWhat
    rez screen do you use?\r\nUse the closest value if you don't see your exact size.\r\n
    800x600; 1024x768; 1280x800; 1680x1050; 1680x1050; 1920x1200; 2048x1280; 2560x1600\r\n\r\nWhat
    pt size do you use?\r\nUse the closest value if you don't see your exact size.\r\n
    7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22\r\n\r\nAt what size
    would you prefer your fonts stems to go to two pixels? A Stem is the vertical
    part of a letter The letter H has two of them.\r\n13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19;
    20; 21; 22\r\n\r\nWhat weight do you like punctuation to be as compared to the
    weight of the font?\r\nJust the same; slightly darker; darker; much darker\r\n\r\nWhat
    kind of zero do you prefer?\r\nPlain; Slashed; Reverse Slashed; Dotted\r\n\r\nColor:
    Do you color-code your code?\r\nYes; No\r\n\r\nWhich do you prefer?\r\nLight text
    on a dark background; Dark text on a light background\r\n\r\n............\r\n\r\nAlso,
    where would you suggest we let people know there is a poll so we get a programmer's
    perspective?"

    and Ruby.  I'm a member of a few other programmer-related forums (mailing lists,
    actually) and would be happy to post a link to a survey, once you get it up and
    working.\r\n\r\nYou might want to add to the survey a question about use of <em>specific</em>
    punctuation.  As you probably know, different languages use different amounts
    of punctuation.  If you're a Perl programmer, your curly-braces, dollar-signs,
    and at-signs will be very important.  A Ruby programmer will have a somewhat different
    set of important characters, a C programmer different still.  LISP programmers
    will care mostly about their parentheses... ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, I suggest adding a
    question inquiring of the programmer's <em>current</em> favorite programming font(s).\r\n\r\n--John"
