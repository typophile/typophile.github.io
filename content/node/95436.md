  body: "BJF Beacon of Light has artificially reduced letters in the lower case, and
    full-size glyphs accompanied by a drawing of a lighthouse in the upper case and
    numerals.\r\n\r\n\"MEG\" took BJF Beacon of Light and modified it to create a
    font without the graphic lighthouse, renaming it to \"BJF Beacon of Light TextOnly\".\r\n\r\nThis
    is in the Solotype Catalog on page 22 as 'Roulette'. There is also a 'Roulette'
    on page 16, which doesn't have the white stencil effect. The solid version can
    be obtained as  Wood Type (URW), Rajah (URW),  Saloon Girl (FontMesa), and Roulette
    Caps (Opti).\r\n\r\n  - Herb\r\n"
