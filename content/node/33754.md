  studies I was charged up with\r\nmotivation and vigour and ready to set the world
  on\r\nfire with my typographic innovation.\r\nBut six years have passed and I have
  had a wide variety\r\nof experience from major UK publishers to music magazines\r\nto
  starting my own practice.\r\nand I have only used vetica 3 times!\r\n\r\nBut I have
  reached a stage where I need some new\r\ndirection / inspiration [you know what
  I mean] \r\nAs a result I have been thinking about doing a\r\na sagmeister and having
  a year without clients /\r\nre-exploring what got me excited about typo-based-graphic-design\r\nin
  the first place.\r\nso I was thinking about working toward doing some post graduate\r\nstudies
  / locking myself in the shed with a laptop and a printer\r\nfor a year...\r\nCan
  anybody advise on what they would do /\r\nwhat schools to look at\r\n[as you only
  get one chance and it costs you a lot of cash]\r\nI love European typography\r\nand
  can't get enough of Berlin\r\n\r\nBut this looks pretty mental\r\n\r\nhttp://www.werkplaatstypografie.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  know others out there are thinking the same\r\nwhere did the enthusiasm go\r\n\r\n\r\nany
  advice or discussion would \r\nbe greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: Since I don't know you and don't know what you are interested in, could you
    perhaps enlighten me? I agree that some kind of study would be a good thing, but
    there are so many different paths to take, so what discourse are you into? By
    the way I applied for the Werkplaats this year, so fingers crossed, knock on wood,
    salt over the shoulder.

    body: "Hello Claus,\r\nThanks for the reply. \r\nThats whats weird about posting
      such things.\r\nYour reply sent me off on a sideways journey and I ended up
      deciding to make a web-page that I can keep referring to until I decide where
      to go with all of this. \r\nThis is the link to the page you inspired:\r\nhttp://web.mac.com/eskimographicdesign/iWeb/Site/Typo_Files/Typo_Files.html\r\n\r\nHave
      a look below and perhaps we could discuss it further...\r\nThe very best of
      luck to you with werkplaats application, I was thinking about visiting this
      summer is it far from Amsterdam?\r\n\r\nIt would be great to continue/start
      a discussion about typographic discourse with you. \r\n\r\nAnyway have a read
      and thank you again.\r\n\r\nO.K here goes:\r\nI\u2019m interested in designing
      meaningful communication with typography as its primary\r\nmethod of delivering
      that message. When we say meaningful its more to do with who we communicate
      on behalf of. Ideally we try and succeed 96.8% of the time to produce design
      for organisations that are not predominately led by profit.\r\nSo guess that
      is more about the type of work I am drawn to from a client / commissioned point
      of view. The way I see it if you don\u2019t design your work for clients and
      its not actual \u2018living\u2019 design you are not a designer. This to me
      is more like art, as what is design without a purpose? \r\nWhat am I interested
      in as an approach to the above, trying not to follow fashion or be influenced
      too much by the zeitgeist, \u2018style not fashion\u2019 is a bit of a mantra
      to me.\r\nI\u2019m fascinated by the tone of voice / character specifying typography
      can create.\r\nI was playing today with using a serif \u2018utopia\u2019 on
      a community sport poster. \r\nIt looked wrong but I was very interested in why
      it was wrong.\r\nthis wrongness I like to play with but it tends to be where
      I depart from what I call serious design. As time wares on I care less and less
      about this.\r\nThe Alan Fletcher exhibition reminded me you can have fun and
      play with type and language. I have been putting this into place recently with:
      \r\nTeachers Museum Project\r\nDual Existence Film titles\r\nArtists catalogue
      - fur tongues\r\nPhotography exhibition catalogue\r\nCommunity sport posters\r\nWe
      also have a visual identity for a film production organisation.\r\nand have
      been specifically asked to be \u2018playful\u2019\r\nSo I\u2019m addressing
      the logical and trying to release the playful me.\r\n\r\nWith regards to what
      discourse am I into?\r\nWhat a magnificent question:\r\nNot really sure what
      is on offer.\r\nI\u2019m a neo-modernist / digital dada-ist / absurdist rationalist\r\nI\u2019m
      really interested in people and exploring how design can enrich\r\npeoples lives.\r\nWhat
      are you into Claus?\r\nI am a bit stuck here..."
