<li>
<p>the &ldquo;average&rdquo; results would probably be skewed by China and India. I would narrow the definition of average. Also what people &ldquo;see&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean they are the best selling. Graphic designers buy fonts, so those bundled with vinyl sign cutters, those used by books and newspapers, bundled with computers are probably not the best sellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Monotype Imaging and Bitstream are publically traded companies so you can probably get a good picture based on their annual reports.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;And your right. See ≠ best selling. I’m not interested in sales. Just what they SEE the most. Sales has nothing to do with this question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is confusing; why is your thread title &ldquo;How big is the font industry?&rdquo; and why are you asking about annual revenues? If sales is of no interest, and visibility is the crucial point, then you are talking about exposure, perception, popularity, which, in western cultures, does not necessarily reflect anything about the &ldquo;font industry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I say this because your questions seem unfocused, and my answers would have to be lengthy and include many caveats and questions in return. For example, what do you mean by &ldquo;as common as Times&rdquo;? Since Times is about 90 years old, and has been made available in every type format since its release, and has been included in all major personal computing platforms as a default since the early 80&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s impossible to consider designing a typeface as widely used, or as easily available, or as thoroughly exposed as Times. This completely ignores the issue of what Times has historically proven to be worth in financial terms, or what you might pay as the total cost of a new design.</p>
<p>This is the tip of quite an iceberg.</p>
