body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nJust a quick question: Is there such a things as a
  guide to typical or standard character sizes? I'm in the process of creating a new
  typeface and I'm having trouble deciding on the width of some characters in relation
  to each other... for example, what's the typical length of the minus hyphen compared
  to the m dash? And the plus character? And so on and so on... Some very good info
  is in the \"Character design standards\" Microsoft Typography site, but no info
  on widths/proportions.\r\n\r\nAlso, any resource listing all the characters that
  \"need\" to be included in a font? My typeface will be Latin and Cyrillic and I'm
  using other fonts to look at which characters to include.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    or on the Selectric Composer, since these were systems that made character widths
    explicit.\r\n\r\nMy web page, at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm\r\n\r\nhappens
    to deal with this very subject."

  body: "Regarding Latin and Cyrillic, both of those are nearly open-ended. How *much*
    Latin/Cyrillic do you want to cover? It's a complicated question.\r\n\r\nSome
    Latin groupings, each a superset of the previous\r\n\r\nWestern Europe (Adobe
    Latin 1 or 2)\r\n+CE\r\n+Adobe CE (includes Turkish, Baltic, etc, a.k.a. Adobe
    Latin 3)\r\n+Vietnamese\r\nAdobe Latin 4 (not much more than Vietnamese)\r\n\r\nSee
    http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html for more on this.\r\n\r\nOne
    can make a similar ladder for Cyrillic. See for example: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining_an_ext.html\r\nNot
    quite as well developed, but a start.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
