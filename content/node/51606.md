  fabricated a spurious edition of The New York Times, that vastly overrated, unreliable
  and compromized newspaper basking in its undeserved reputation for quality and accuracy.\r\n\r\n----->
  Here is <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g2iXmvWWipHA4VprWUol2bB3ZK7w\">the
  link</a>. <-----\r\n\r\nNow all we need is a fake Typophile website. I'm kidding.
  Of course I don't really mean that, but I can think of at least half a dozen typophilers
  who would fall for a fake Typophile website in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nThat's
  all the news I've got for now. Anybody want to look at the typography of this hoax
  paper, the logo and ads and so on. Wish I had time myself, but sadly not.\r\n\r\nj

    it, and did a double take. I practically went over and stared, then went to the
    nearest newsstand, where of course The New York Times looked completely different.
    :-D \r\n\r\nThe (real) New York Times covers it <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/pranksters-spoof-the-times/\">here</a>,
    and has a link to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes-se.com/\">the online version of
    the spoof</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd Si, I do remember the typochild April Fools joke. :-)"
