  received.  However, we quickly got into the disucssion about 'appropriateness' regarding
  a particular typeface.  It's an ultra-simple grid-based font.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that
  it would probably be more appropriate if the edges of the elements were not sharp...instead
  they should all be rounded.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I'm in a position to build a font that
  is clearly based upon something else, yet I'm making some small global changes.
  \ I don't even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their
  actual work...but I  wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of
  things?\r\n\r\nAny tips?\r\n\r\nThanks..."

    number of machines and locations as specified by the eula. 2. you customize it
    as the client wishes. 3. the client replaces the customized font into the same
    licensing \"footprint\" as the original font. 4. You don't license the font to
    anyone else unless they have the same deal as the first client, and it's not exclusive
    to that client, or you totally recreate the font from scratch, remaking all the
    contours, all spacing and tables as if it was new.\r\n"

    scratch?  I was thinking that I would do it from scratch since the grid is as
    simple as it gets...

  body: "You say \u201Csmall changes\u201D, what does that mean? To me, the first
    thing is to look at the EULA.  If you don\u2019t own the font, ask the foundry
    about it. If you are just doing a few words and not an actual font and the result
    will not be taken as the original you are probably OK. If you are making an entire
    font for sale competing with the original, it should be clearly enough different
    to not be taken as a rip off.  If it must look just like the original with a few
    minor changes, ask the designer to do it for you or give you permission to do
    it your self.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: i am of the opinion that if you're rebuilding the font from scratch, using
    none of the information of the original font, and making substantial enough changes
    for people to notice the difference between the original and your new font, you're
    safe not having to even deal with the the font that was the source of inspiration.

    was trying to talk about the etiquette of showing others where the inspiration

  body: "I personally don't think you should share your source for inspiration.\r\n\r\n1.
    The client could end up liking the source and wanting you to round the corners
    of the source and you'll be left with a typeface you've created and hope someone
    else wants it.\r\n2. Giving clients too much information can sometimes muddy the
    waters of simplicity.\r\n\r\nSo, you don't have the typeface, but you did use
    it? How did you use it? Or I mean how were you able to draw inspiration from it?\r\n\r\n"

    if you rebuild it from scratch, you shouldnt care about any EULA. if you can convince
    the client to buy a license just because its better ethicaly, do it. but in the
    end you have all the work and have to build this thing from scratch, so you did
    it.\r\n\r\nif you use a grid you've seen used by somebody else, but you have to
    rebuild it entirely from scratch (in indesign, quark or whatever), its your work,
