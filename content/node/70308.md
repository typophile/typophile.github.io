body: "Hello folks,  for a research project I would like to know which was the first
  font that included a semi-serif version and/or a mixed version (half serif, half
  sans)\r\n\r\nI remember now Rotis from Mr. Aicher or Penumbra from Mr. Hidy. But
  Im not sure which one was the first that presented this possibility. And of course
  Thesis...\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd second is, if you thing that a semi-serif version really
  is usefull in the real life (for text for example) or its just a variety used more
  in titles.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nLeonardo Vazquez"

    set entirely in TheMix, IIRC, with lots of big type. Tantamount to a type specimen.
