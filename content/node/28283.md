  Here's my edition of Edgar Allen Poe's <strong>the Raven</strong>. \r\n\r\nIt's
  my first attempt, but please don't be kind. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.geocities.com/nearborn/theraven.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. Any criticism you can provide will be helpful."

  body: "Dan\r\n\r\nNot being kind, or otherwise, just pointing out what I see.\r\n\r\nNot
    a bad story to start with. The text face works, I'm blanking out on what it is.
    The line measure works.\r\n\r\nI'd say the comp is okay but I'd suggest a British
    style rather than the American; en dash treatment rather than just the em dash,
    maybe use the single quotes, etc. Your spacing looks controlled (with an error
    or two) but the British approach might help here (see Bringhurst I guess). Maybe,
    maybe not, but I'd tighten the spacing up where punctuation occurs, especially
    before caps.\r\n\r\nYour hyphenation needs work. Two letter beginnings aren't
    so good. Kick those over.\r\n\r\nThe title needs typographic pizzaz or you basically
    have nothing. Right now, who cares? This is where you can show your stuff, so
    do it.\r\n\r\nKern the D and G in Edgar just a tad please, if not for me, do it
    for Poe.\r\n\r\nThe initial letter O needs a better treatment. It's not a bad
    approach but it is set mechanically. Think organically. Don't let the machine
    dictate typography to you. Now how would Peter Schoeffer have handled that? :\u2014)\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, have fun, be proud.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"

  body: "The punctuation space. I knew it. It comes from using a particular Emigre
    font famous for its 'less than ideal' spacing. I had hoped to contain a little
    bit of its rambunctiousness, but I can see that it just wouldn't work for anything
    longer than this piece.\r\n\r\nEns for Ems? I can try it. I don't remember, hairspace
    right?\r\n\r\nAs for the hyphens, I hate them always. Always. But I really, really
    hate wide word spacing. I have everything set to about 80% word spacing. But in
    order to fix some of the punctuation space errors, I started using non-breaking
    thin spaces. That, of course, opened up another whole can of worms, i.e., more
    ugly word space issues. \r\n\r\nI'm really starting to see why spacing is an artform.\r\n\r\nThe
    big O is really just pissing me off. I haven't quite figured out how to get InDesign
    to do what I want. I converted the O to an outline, then adjusted some things,
    but you're right. Not organic at all. I've contemplated taking out the raised
    cap and just keeping the small caps for the intitial phrase.\r\n\r\nGoogled Peter
    Shoeffer. Guess he might know something about decorative initials. :)\r\n\r\nThanks.
    I'll post a revised version sometime or another.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi again\r\n\r\nMrs Eaves? I've never had occasion to use it but I really
    don't have a problem with it and I thought the text had sort of the right funk
    to it because of the typeface. You can always adjust the kerning pairs to your
    liking.\r\n\r\nThe spacing isn't bad. The face has a wide look to it. I noticed
    more instances of getting close to overly tight spacing rather than loose spacing.
    I tend to space rather tightly myself. A hangover from my metal type days. But
    too tight, too loose, the eye catches these things. This is best controlled with
    the right combination of line measure and hyphenation. At some point, if you try
    long enough, it usually hits the right spot.\r\n\r\nMaybe the O needs to be bigger
    or drop down into the text. Try it as a toned color. If Indy is screwing with
    it screw Indy and just make it into an image file and work around it with the
    text.\r\n\r\nPlus the O is just round. You need probably a better O. Work out
    a different typeface for the display titling and take the O from that.\r\n\r\nThe
    raven needs to crackle.\r\n\r\nSchoeffer is underrated in the historical myth
    telling of the Gutenberg saga but not so much in the more serious printing history
    research. He is where we come from.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "I think you are fighting the \u2018qualities\u2019 of Mrs Eaves while starting
    book design and it might be just too much to take on in one go. The low x-height
    with the generous leading make for a rather bright page, you might look at Storm's
    Baskerville Ten as an alternative. \r\nIt seems to me that the outside margin
    is rather large and is pushing the text block towards the centre and the bottom
    margin is pushing it up. For the Decorative O you could look at dropping it down
    a little and a touch to the left and let it move the second line across. I would
    second Gerald\u2019s comment about en dashes and in this case hairspaces might
    be the way to go. Run a check for \u2019tis, I spotted \u2018Tis in the first
    para.\r\nTim"

  body: Put the 'Big O" in a seperate text box and use Text Wrap to play with it as
    a drop cap - this will allow you more control than a menu driven drop cap.

    as a possibility in many projects, ive never gone through with it. It looks really
    nice, and then you see a whole page of it and like what was said earler, its bright.
    Margins seem a little large, what size is the indent?\r\n\r\nNot sure what anyone
    else calls or thinks of this but watch for the pig bristles. \r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "<strong>Revision 1</strong>\r\nI tried setting everything in Berthold's Baskerville
    Book, but it didn't have the same \"wild\" feeling the Mrs. Eaves has. Since the
    setting is so short, I figure it'll work fine.\r\n\r\nSo I scrapped Revision 1\r\n\r\n<strong>Revision
    2</strong>\r\nI finally gave in and decided to modify the page size. I originally
    was trying, unsuccessfully, to create a text block on a 8.5 x 11\" page. But,
    since this is practice, I modified everything to fit on a 6.8 x 11\" Golden page.
    \r\n\r\nThe title page, etc, was re-set in Kepler. (By the way, has anyone used
    this typeface? It's freakin' huge! I mean, over a hundred different fonts? I don't
    know what I was getting into when I bought it. I haven't really heard any comments
    about it. Any thoughts?)\r\n\r\nI think it crackled up the raven a bit :)\r\n\r\nThe
    margins are:\r\n1.1\" top & inside \r\n1.36\" outside\r\n2.2\" bottom\r\n\r\nEn
    dashes definitely help the color. Way too many dashes in the first place. Additionally,
    I don't know why there was so much punctuation used, like a hyphen after a colon,
    so I simplified things. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.geocities.com/nearborn/theraven3.pdf"

    was quite a burden on the older systems.\r\n\r\nIt's looking very good dude. Pull
    Edgar Allen Poe over to visually (not mechanically) line up with the The in the
    title. See what that looks like. Maybe lead out the title a bit. Looks tight but
    what do I know.\r\n\r\nWow, I'm proud of you.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"
