		<div class="commentbody">@All: The reason us old guys can do it from memory is that we started before computers and internet. We didn’t have fancy software or forums. We had “books.” “<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p-book">P-books</a>” at that.

It was only from repeat exposure that, over time, we formed strong associative neural pathways which lead us to develop “long term memory.”

We couldn’t ask Bing, Google was a funny word that had something to do with numbers, and you were probably just a twinkle in someone’s eye.

It’s really simple. Taking advantage of your resources to assist in efficient problem solving only makes sense. But the skills development in the what I dub the “Search versus Solve” dichotomy still remains.

In two proverbs:

“<em>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a Day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime</em>.

and

“<em>Practice makes perfect</em>.”

My advice? Just spend the money on a HARD COPY of the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/">FontBook</a>, bust out a pencil and sketchbook, and flip through a few pages every morning with your coffee. Take notes and sketch key letters. If memory serves, FontBook doesn’t show complete alphabets. <strong>Very</strong> disappointing, but a good start. Always keep your eyes peeled for good specimen books. Another one in my library I quite enjoy reading is <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/American-Metal-Typefaces-Twentieth-Century/dp/0938768344">American metal typefaces of the twentieth century</a>. Many specimens are accompanied by a short historical paragraph. A fun read. Don’t waste your money on a paperback. Hunt for a deal on a hard-cover. The paperback will simply fall apart within a year.

No go! go off into the world of “Paper” and explore! Be free!!

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry Christopher, but speak for yourself. I've been using computers from way before I was aware of type, and I only started talking to other people about type thanks to Typo-L. I've never spent an inordinate amount of time perusing printed specimen books, and don't recommend killing more trees just to get better at ID-ing fonts. But that doesn't mean I don't appreciate real talent and skill at ID-ing fonts; running software to do it for you might be more efficient for the person you're helping, but it doesn't really help the person doing it get better at anything (and thereby helping others in more significant ways).

If I can't use books for ecological reasons and using the internet and software is also bad practice (for me, apparently), what's a boy to do?

My first port of call is the backlog of stored information in my head, and if that doesn't come up trumps, I use whatever resources are appropriate.

Surely, the most important thing is to learn and try to remember.

“<em>Surely, the most important thing is to learn and try to remember</em>.”

My points exactly. Using software and getting someone to do your work for you is not helping them learn. Yes, it’s taking advantage of valuable resources, but it ultimately stunts their ability to do it themselves. Perhaps I’m living in the past. I’ve also made the same point before in that if we as a community take care of other people’s leg work, they aren’t going to develop those muscles, and 10 years from now we’ll have a weaker community. A difficult balance, and obviously the solution lies in a combination of both, but all too many times I see “do my homework” “what’s this font” and a plethora of students doing a simple Google image search and slapping some type on it (which someone else probably told them to use), or even worse, “ffffinding” a solution and ripping it off. It’s really simple from where I stand. If your first line of attack is to ask Wikipedia, you are stunting your problem solving skills. I would match any stake that this will become a very important conversation in the next few years in the fields of sociology, cultural anthropology, heck, even neuropsychology (if it isn’t already).

And as far as trees go, don’t get me started. The carbon footprint of the computer you are using right now is ridiculous compared to that of a book. Computers are made from finite mineral resources and (currently) powered by petroleum products which the world is at war over. That, and trees are a renewable resource which can lead towards a sustainable economy. <em>And</em> high quality acid-free paper is by far in a way the most stable way to archive information. #rant</div>
