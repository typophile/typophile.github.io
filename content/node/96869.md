  typefaces.\r\n\r\nThere do appear to be some differences in them, not withstanding
  the face that Linotype Univers and Univers Next offer a far greater number of weights
  than Univers, as well as the more desirable ampersand; the cut (so to speak) appears
  different. Both Linotype Univers and Univers Next seem to have more modulation in
  the strokes, and Linotype Univers 430, which I assumed to be an equivalent to Univers
  55, seems, well, heavier!\r\n\r\nAlso, any idea which is closer to Frutiger's original
  design?\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\nIain."

    at least in the case of Times Roman, the current digital version, as opposed to
    the versions by Linotype and Monotype in the hot metal era, as the \"standard\"
    that people recognize.\r\n\r\nThat the same might be true of Univers, leading
    to a conclusion that digital type is still in its infancy, and lacks subtle qualities
    of grace and beauty - or some other characteristic - generally present in the
    hot metal era does not strike me as wildly improbable.\r\n\r\nThe good news is
    that there's every chance this lack has the potential to become a \"recognized
    quality\" - there's no royal road to designing better types, but this could be
    something any competent type designer could learn not to overlook. (Or it could
    require cooperation from others, such as adding other types of curve instead of
    just B\xE9zier curves to the font technology.)"

    was constrained to meet the lowest common denominator of Linotype and Monotype.
    So the italics were spaced exactly the same as the Roman (as Linotype required)
    and the letters were all constrained to have widths belonging to the Monotype
    18-unit system.\r\n\r\nThese constraints set limits to the design, and doubtless
    they did impair the aesthetic quality of the result - at least <em>slightly</em>.\r\n\r\nBut

    despite agreeing with you up to this point in principle, I part company.\r\n\r\nGiven

    being too gravely impaired by these constraints, do you <em>really</em> think
    that a net improvement is the most likely result of some newbie font designer
    at Adobe being given a free hand to change the metrics and the design as he sees

    it offers the promise of a better product, without necessarily providing criteria

    be fair to Linotype, they did provide such a criteria in their rationale for a
    new Univers. (Here... http://www.linotype.com/1813-15545/whyanewunivers.html )
    Which, on the face of it, seems to be to provide more weights, with careful attention

    for \"...improved legibility and on-screen application.\" Also implicit in their

  body: "You are asking for the real Univers. \r\nlet me give you a few insights on
    this. \r\nUnivers was a face that was originally made for hotmetal at Deberny
    & Peignot. It had this 16 degrees slanted italic. \r\nThis was at Linotype for
    the matrices of the hotmetal machines not possible. Therefore the type needed
    a lesser slant angle 11 degrees. You know the regular (55) and the italic (56)
    were needed on one matrice, meant they had to share the same width. The same was
    necessary for the bold (75) which was on the same width like the regular (55).
    \ \r\nThere was also another thing that I did not understand in the beginning
    of my career at Stempel and Linotype. Why does the hotmetal version has such a
    nice et-sign and why is this dump &-sign in the fonts. \r\nClear answer, that
    was based on customer requests from the US, they are used to the & sign form and
    could not understand what the et-ligature from Frutigers Univers mean.\r\nAnd
    therefore the fonts have this sign included. In the new versions we have the new
    sign, but again some US customers complained.....\r\n\r\nThese fonts than needed
    to be compatible with our phototypesetting machines, as our former customers did
    not wanted to let their customers identify in print whether it was hotmetal or
    phototype. It needed to be width compatible. \r\nThis we migrated through all
    our technologies until the Linotype Laserfonts. The only difference we made was
    that the italics were really drawn as italics. You know the differences between
    a slanted font and an italic form.\r\nWhen Linotype entered into the production
    with Adobe to make the Postscript library Univers was one of the first fonts and
    Linotype at that time did not yet had the Adobe tools to make our own digitization.
    So we supplied Adobe with digital data and they made the conversion into PS fonts.
    For italic it was at that early stage of the development the habit to just make
    set a slant angle into the fonts and you have an italic. which was than called
    oblique. Therefore Univers 55 oblique and not 56 Italic.\r\n\r\nWhan Adrian saw
    the digitization he was not pleased, but it was nearly similar to the Linotype
    version which was this mechanic restricted version. so this was transitioned into
    this technology. \r\nIn 1996 Gerards Unger was approaching Bruno Steinert (our
    former MD) and me at the AtypI and explained ushis philosophy that we should extend
    our classic faces and do a similar work like with neue Helvetica and revise the
    Univers family to a more consistant family.\r\nWe approached Frutiger with that
    idea and he at that time just recovered from a heart surgery with three bypasses
    and he was pleased that Linotype took up this idea to make a new version of the
    Univers family. At that time he was completely clear in his head and he was working
    hard on this project with our former type director Reinhard Haus. The beginning
    was a trial to look if we could use the exisiting data and refine just a few errors
    in the outllines, but we realized that this was not leading to the right result.
    So we scraped all this work and restarted by looking at the original prints form
    the hotmetal Univers. But there as you can imagine were also resulting inconsistancies
    in the family and weights that Adrian used the prints and used his scissors to
    cut and shape the letters into a form the was for his eyes pleasing.\r\nSo the
    Linotype Univers family was developed. It was the beginning of our Platinum Collection
    to which Gerard Unger was the originator.\r\nMore you can read at our website
    \r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/de/6933/linotypeunivers.html\r\nThere was one thing
    left over for many years. (the family should get small caps) and this gap was
    filled a few years ago and we detected that the naming of the font was not as
    good like all the other products form the Platinum Collection used nova or Next.
    And therefore we renamed the complete family into Univers Next and added the small
    caps to the fonts. Nothing else had been changed.\r\nIf you want more to know

    realize that the Univers for the Selectric Composer was an official adaptation.\r\n\r\nEven
    so, because the spacing used for the machine was close to ideal for Times Roman,
    thus making their imitation, Press Roman, successful, the sans-serif faces such
    as Univers and Theme left too much space around the lowercase i and l, for example.\r\n\r\nStill,
    that doesn't mean the face doesn't contain useful information about how Fruitger
    intended Univers to look - and how to modify it to respond to constraints. So
    I approve of studying it, but I can't consider it worthy of revival."

    thanks so much for your inside knowledge on Univers. It certainly does help clear
    up some of the mysteries of the 'old' digital Univers, such as the ampersand.
    How could anybody complain about Frutiger's lovely 'Et'? It's one of my favourite
    features of Univers, and a reasons why I regret having purchased a few weights
    of the old version.\r\n\r\nAs an employee of Linotype, I'm not sure you'll feel
    inclined to answer the following, but I'll ask it in case you do (indeed, if anyone
    has any insights on this)...\r\n\r\nWhat was the deal with Berthold Univers' disappearance
    from the marketplace? I believe it was a favourite of some Univers officianados
    (such I Willi Kunz, I think). I know there was some kind of legal dispute, but
    I wondered why Bitstream still sell Univers (albeit by another name - Zurich),
    yet Berthold has withdrawn it's offering. Anyway, thought I'd put that out there."

  body: "Incidentally, the Selectric Composer provides an illustrative example of
    how a variety of typeface designs fare when subjected to a similar (but more severe)
    set of constraints than those to which Sabon was  subject.\r\n\r\n1) Type elements
    contained only 88 characters, and so the same unit system applied to Roman, Italic,
    and Bold weights of every typeface.\r\n\r\n2) The device employed a 9-unit system.
    However, this was <em>not</em> twice as coarse as the Monotype 18-unit system;
    instead, most letters were assigned widths comparable to those used for Times
    Roman, scaled down from 18 units to the em to 11 units to the em.\r\n\r\n3) Hence,
    the letters m, M, and W were narrower than they should have been to be in the
    correct proportion, being 9 units wide rather than 11, in order to fit on the
    type element (it being desired to support type sizes up to 11 points, and to use
    the same basic type element as used in normal Selectric typewriters).\r\n\r\nI
    just thought it would be worth citing this example in this thread, as comparing
    Press Roman to Times Roman, and so on, might give a benchmark for the potential
    impact of technical constraints on Sabon, and how well Jan Tschichold did in overcoming
    them.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, yes - here's the link\r\n\r\n[[http://ibmcomposer.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=56]]"
