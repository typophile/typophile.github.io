body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Melia_6019.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's another project,
  currently titled Melia. It's a friendly agate design, maybe less successful at its
  intended size than as a magazine headline font. It's also surprisingly readable
  on screen even without hinting.\r\n\r\nI think some of the proportions are slightly
  off but need some fresh eyes to tell me which bits. And I should expect my spacing
  is way too tight as usual :P\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Melia-News-Story_4217.gif]"

    suggestions, most of which I completely agree with. Interesting you spotted the
    foot of d as undecided...I couldn't quite figure out what it needed, but you're
    right it's a bit wide and the notch needs enlarging.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I want
    to put traps in: I'd prefer to make the target size larger I think (yes I realise
    I'm quite often backwards in my approach!) Cheers."

    odd impression: That \"tiny\" in the heading somehow looks like each letter is
    gradually taller. Maybe the lowered \"t\" crossbar is just bugging me, but there's
    also something funky going on with the \"y\" being too tall or the \"n\" not having
    enough overshoot. Actually in the other sample, in \"Swanhaven\" the \"v\" also
    seems quite a bit too tall. Not sure what's going on there.\r\n\r\nEdit: Wow,
    synchroposting. I don't even remember what I wrote in that email. I should go

    that small sizes and solid Hinting, too. I currenty work on a very similar design.
    But yours is much more polished and has the nicer rhythm. :) Maybe you have the
    time to drop by and leave some thoughts/critique. [[http://typophile.com/node/67799]]\r\n\r\nSome
    thoughts on your design: \r\n\r\n- \"y\" seems to be above baseline. Maybe lowering
    the connection between the stems would help here.\r\n\r\n- \"z\" seems a little
    bit wide for you rather tidy design.\r\n\r\n- Crossed lines in \"x\" and \"X\"
    appear broken. Shifting the thiner line by some units could counter that effect.\r\n\r\n-
    The tail of \"Q\" seems a little too bold to me, but maybe thats just me.\r\n\r\n-
    Maybe shape of \"W\" is a little too distinctive in that overall design."

    rasterising ;)\r\n\r\nYeah, y does connect above the baseline, that was the only
    solution that worked in the end. Do you find it distracting in text, or just when
    zoomed in large?\r\n\r\nI'll have a look at that z. Maybe it's just the spacing
    not quite there yet.\r\n\r\nX/x: I always get into trouble with the offset! Again,
    I'll have a poke around.\r\n\r\nW: Thanks, I hadn't seen that. But I wonder if
    it's possible to pull the middle up without making the whole thing much wider.\r\n\r\nI'm
    fearing the spacing is still a bit bumpy but I'm not very good at seeing it. Think
    I'll need to print some blocks at various sizes and test. If only I could manage

  body: "I wish I was as lucky with my hinting. ;) \r\n\r\nAcutally the \"y\" causes
    this \"baseline bump\" in every size. But set very large, it becomes more of an
    headline feature thingy. So maybe you can work out a whole optical size font for
    Melia with this.\r\n\r\nI have quite the same problems like you with Brevier.
    Especially color and width problems. It is very nice to see how you solved that
    problems and where we found similar and also different solutions for the same
    problem. :) Maybe an acceptable solution for \"W\" is too pull the middle up and
    at the same time change the angle of the stems to be more vertical. \"W\" in Brevier
    is also very wide and I like it. ;) \r\n\r\nStrange thing is that \"M\" in Melia
    is not bugging me at all, even if it does not hit the baseline with its middle.
    But in \"W\" this seems to be much more obvious and in fact it is bugging me there.
    But maybe thats just me again. ;)"

    well at 7pt. I haven't tested the bold yet, but I suspect that'll serve as a middling-headliney
    sort of target size.

  body: "This is really really great work.\r\n\r\nOn the corner rounding:\r\n- I would
    guess that if the Regular's really intended for small sizes, its corners shouldn't
    be rounded at all (better in fact that they would pinch outwards, I'd guess).\r\n-
    I wonder if the rounding on the Bold font should be diminished, to distinguish
    it more from the Rounded Bold.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n- Does the tail of the
    Regular alternate /g/ come around too far? Or maybe it has to, to keep the raised-off-the-baseline
    bowl from looking like it's floating...\r\n- Love the /Q/s!\r\n- Should there
    be a hair--just a hair--more weight to the part of the /t/ above the crossbar?\r\n-
    What it the thinking behind not having the period and comma align at the top in
    the bold weights?\r\n- It might be nice to get a little more breathing room between
    stroke and tittle in the bold /i/s and /j/s. Would one want to lower the stroke
    below the mean line (analogous to lifting /g.alt/'s bowl off the baseline)?\r\n-
    Those /K/k/ gaps work quite well in the Regular; little less sure in the bolds\r\n-
    Would you consider adding round-structured /w/ and /y/ alternates in the Rounded
    Bold?\r\n- Is /u/ a touch narrow? It looks it surrounded by those big bowls in
    \"Abugeda.\"\r\n- I love that diagonal alignment of the hood- and crossbar terminals
    in /f/.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Craig, I'm happy you're liking this so much!\r\n\r\nYes, I guess you're
    right, the corners should be proper corners (or even have thorns) if it was for
    seriously small sizes. I'm seeing 7pt as a target for the regular \u2014 having
    tested that in various sizes, it works well that size \u2014 surprisingly as it
    doesn't have traps. I wanted it to be suitable for larger sizes though too, and
    the rounding has a good effect there. I suppose I could try a 'plain' non-rounded
    version too. Re the rounding on the bold, you could be right, I'll have to set
    some inline bold with the regular at different sizes to see.\r\n\r\nAlternate
    g, yes, I think I agree. I already pulled the tail back some, but could do with
    a bit more.\r\n\r\nQ is also one of my favourite letters!\r\n\r\nt: not sure,
    what makes you think that?\r\n\r\nComma and period...er...I'm not sure why they
    ended up like that and I had noticed it without really thinking about it. I've
    now pulled the comma up.\r\n\r\ni and j: maybe I'll raise the tittles...I think
    there was some resistance to lowering the stems below the x-line.\r\n\r\nRound
    w and y could be a good idea, especially y I think. And why not in the regular
    and bold too!\r\n\r\nThanks for catching the u...I'm not sure if maybe the b and
    g need a bit of narrowing. The spurless construction makes the counters taller
    so may need a bit of narrowing. I'll have to check the u with other letters. Maybe
    a couple of units only.\r\n\r\nVery good observations, thank you. :)"

    the spacing: you may find that you've discovered letterforms that look great at
    both 7 and 70pt, but spacing them well for both settings might be still harder
    or impossible.\r\n\r\n<em>t: not sure, what makes you think that?</em>\r\n \r\nI
    dunno, it just (in \"System\") looked a little light to me, like it tapers a touch
    too quickly. I could be off on that, though.\r\n\r\n<em>The spurless construction

    sizes. I made the spacing quite loose so it would work first as a text font.\r\n\r\nt,
    yes, I thought you meant the bottom of the taper needed widening, but can see
    the top in fact could be a unit or two wider.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the trick
    with counters is to see the overall area, rather than the exact height or width.
    And the area can be quite dramatically altered even without moving the nodes (just
    the bcps). Like on the bold cap B, I had to make the counters bigger without making
    them wider or taller, which would have affected the width of the strokes or overall
    width of the letter. Interesting.\r\n\r\nHere are the numerals and the round alternates.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gecko
