    for italics:\r\n\r\n<em>Left-leaning italics\r\nIn certain Arabic fonts (eg: Adobe
    Arabic, Boutros Ads), the italic font has the top of the letter leaning to the
    left, instead of leaning to the right. Some font families, such as Venus, Roemisch,
    Topografische Zahlentafel, include left leaning fonts and letters designed for
    German cartographic map production, even though they do not support Arabic characters.</em>\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type\r\n"

    older thread for more suggestions/links</a>. As Dan, Andreas and Andrew have explained,
    reverse italics (\u2018Linkskursiv\u2019 = \u2018left cursive\u2019 or \u2018R\xFCckw\xE4rts
    Liegend\u2019 = \u2018lying backwards\u2019) are often used in cartography, traditionally
    to indicate waters.\r\n\r\nF"
