  body texts. Though I know some suggestions will include replacing Courier, I would
  like to stick with it. As such, it's been a huge challenge finding a typeface to
  work alongside it... Any suggestions??\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    BTW, I own a small novel that uses\r\nfour text faces; it works, because it's
    subtle. But Courier\r\nisn't one of them.  :-)\r\n\r\nWhat about a Courier with
    proportional widths?\r\nDoesn't LineTo have one? That would be less bad...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi hrant,\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion! I'm trying to lay out a book
    on punk rock, so the text for that would be set in Courier, while the other text
    would discuss graphic design in relation to it. There should be enough contrast
    to differentiate between the two subjects, yet tie them together atmospherically
    as well.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at LineTo's version! Thanks!"

    (which I think it\u2019s an appropriate choice) you will end using, make sure
    it\u2019s dark enough (i.e. no Courier New).\r\nDepending on the historical scope
    of the book, a possibility is choosing a text face from the seventies.\r\n"
