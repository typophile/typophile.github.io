		<div class="commentbody">It's the w, v, and y. I need to change them  to fit the face. They are too calligraphic. I like them too much though. I might have to do a different face to match them. One thing, I found out, though, is that in a body of text, the w, v, y don't stand out so much, as they aren't usually together like that. They kind of add some spice. Maybe I can find a way to keep the spice and still match. I definitely agree on the ball serifs. They need some serious work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the s! I can never figure out appropriate terminals. I need to do some serious s research. I'm getting to where I can control the bez-curves, though. (yay, this one didn't take me half as long as some of the others). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to cite hermann as an influence for this face. He does some funky cool stuff with squared serifed faces. Zaph eliptical is one of the coolest things I've seen, it just lacks some flavor.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, I think the lc &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are some of the strongest glyphs of the font. Rather than changing them to fit the face, I'd love to see you change more of the glyphs to fit the characteristics of these three, without changing the &quot;Pill Gothic&quot; structures upon which they were based. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, of the two lc &quot;x&quot;s, I prefer the one with half-serifs. Perhaps several of the other glyphs could get by with half-serifs worked in instead of completely relying on the more classic full-serifs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also think that the &quot;a&quot; and the &quot;w&quot; work well enough together; I think it's the &quot;h&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and (perhaps, but definitely to a lesser degree) &quot;u&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot; that are throwing off the balance by looking too conservative. (Must be the Utah connection, no? ;) ) Judicious use of half-serifs in addition to your serious &quot;s&quot; research ( :D ) may help pull the font back into cohesiveness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for that &quot;s&quot;, have you tried applying the same logic that worked so well with the &quot;a&quot;? That diagonal stroke is really a winner. It might even be interesting applied to the &quot;g&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, do you need the ball terminals at all? The abruptness of the &quot;j&quot; and &quot;t&quot; terminals seems to be working well, and may work just as well on the other characters with similar form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I don't at all mind that Pill Gothic is solid and monolinear, while this one (Pill Aberration) has stroke modulation. The two structures work harmoniously for the FF Scala family, and it looks to me as though they will work equally well for this family. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keep it up &ndash; I'd love to be able to use these someday! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>
