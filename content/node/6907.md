  Photo"> <BR> <BR>i kinda wanted to match type for a headline to the period feel
  to this photo from 1924 and i figgered it gives me an excuse to finally license
  some type from <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/" target="_blank">Letterhead
  Fonts</a>. Problem is: i&#39;m not sure what to choose. <BR> <BR>I kinda like <a
  href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/firehouse.shtml" target="_blank">Fire
  House</a>, but i kinda want something not so flashy??? &#42;unsure&#42; Maybe Argentine
  would be nice or Boston Truckstyle? or maybe someone can suggest something outside
  of LHF. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll probably use Copperplate Gothic for some accompanying
  text, so mixing well with that is another requirement. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, lemme know
  quick... I hafta have this done by Friday and preferably much sooner. Thnx for yer
  help!'

    might work depending on the headline, or if budget is an issue. <BR> <BR>And just
    for fun, and since you mentioned fire engine lettering, the following are two
    photos from the Window Lettering workshop at Typecon with John Downer and Leonard
    Otillio. Here Leonard has silkscreened down the black and a dull bevel varnish,
    and is laying down the gold leaf: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/50079.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>After that&#39;s dry, holes have been patched, and backing applied,
    the excess leaf is rubbed off. After the leaf went on I was skeptical of how nice
    it would come out because it was so wet and wrinkly. Not so. Nice don&#39;t begin
    to describe the result. Check that bevel varnish now. Sweet golden goodness. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>He said he does this on firetrucks too, but most often what you see around
    is done cheaply with pre-made vinyl letters. Fun to learn more about this niche
    field. <BR> <BR>R'
