body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am the Faculty Advisor of the Shakespeare Press Museum,
  a working printing museum on the campus of Cal Poly University in San Luis Obispo,
  California.\r\n\r\nWe have 18 operating presses and about 400 metal and wood type
  fonts.\r\n\r\nOur never-ending problem is cataloging and indexing our collection
  of type, some of which is so rare that we don't know what it is, where it came from,
  or what to call it.\r\n\r\nI have been working for several months to develop a method
  for cataloging the nicks on the type we have, which I plan to use to help identify
  type that is not distributed correctly, or at all.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the potential
  weaknesses of the system (different nicks in the same font, for example) I would
  like to put this out to the Typophile forum for comment.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to scan
  the profile of a character in a font, then to make a digital record of the profile.
  Then, I would like to encode a series of numeric values for the size, position and
  shape of the various type nicks.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, it might be possible
  to \"simply\" look up the nick pattern, using the font database, and have the database
  respond with a list of fonts that qualify.\r\n\r\nWHAT I WANT FROM YOU:\r\n\r\nPlease
  tell me if I am completely crazy (I am), and please provide constructive ideas if
  you can.\r\n\r\nI have not begun to implement this yet. I am in the planning stage,
  asking if the typographic public thinks this is a good idea.\r\n\r\nAny input from
  the members of Typophile would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBrian P.
  Lawler\r\nSan Luis Obispo, California\r\n"

  body: "I thought about the same problem, when I started to print and scan my Font
    Collection of lead letter fonts:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/schriftensammlung.html\r\n\r\nHere
    I show a full character set with the following information:\r\nfont name\r\nfoundry\r\nyear
    of first produing this font\r\ndeveloper\r\nGroups, using DIN 16518.\r\nI upload
    a picture of the full character scan.\r\n\r\nThe next problem, I saw, was to find
    a solution for an internal database. This was, what the website archive could
    not solve.\r\nAnd I found another way, which might help you.\r\n\r\nI took Excel.\r\nIncluded
    name, foundry, year of production, developer (and could, of course, add sizes,
    which I own, archive numbers of cabinets and case). And in the last column of
    the Excel file I wrote a link to the picture of the scanned characterset, together
    with a small picture of this it into the column.\r\n\r\nThe big advantage now
    is:\r\nI can sort the Excel file in every way I want.\r\nI can sort by developer,
    by groups. Or (in your case) e.g. sorting by all 14 p sized fonts or whatever.
    From the sort file I can generate a PDF, what I offer to my visitors on my website
    for downloading. The PDF (this is not ready yet) can be generated, so the link
    with the picture of the character set, can be choosed.\r\n\r\nFor my needs its
    a very satisfying solution.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you considered adapting biometric identification (fingerprint, palm print, face,
    iris) software and hardware? All of those basically identify lines and curves
    and convert them into numeric values. A USB fingerprint reader might work just
    fine."

  body: "I appreciate both comments. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI think the idea of a fingerprint
    scanner is great. I wonder if it can be adapted to work with type?\r\n\r\nThe
    other thing I might be able to do is to have some brilliant computer science student
    write an edge-identification program for me, then we could just feed it scans,
    and let the database find similar edges.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you!\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n"
