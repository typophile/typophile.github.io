body: I have noticed a wired character on car number plates in the UK. The character
  looks like a backwards, upside down L, or like a 7. But is has straight strokes
  and is right angled. Has anyone seen such a character, or do they know what it is.
  I have looked through the Mandatory typeface, but the character is not in it..?

    you mean, unless it's an illegal customization trying to resemble a word.

    talking about :)

  body: If it *is* a number (and not some ornament!), it cannot be anything else than
    a '7'. Perhaps the font has been tweeked to prevent ad hoc modification of license
    plates.

    made from wire.

  body: http://www.charles-wright.com/more.html shows the official font, both in the
    reduced-character-set version for number plates, and the fuller version for text.
    Suggests that this odd character is either from someone using an unofficial lookalike
    font, or some effect caused by deliberate (dubiously-legal) placement of black
    fixing screws to alter the appearance of another character...?

    in Britain, but is it possible that they got a number 0 and tried to paint with
    white/yellow paint to look like a 7? Did the spacing look off?\r\n\r\npenscript"

    another sample of a seven that looks like (and is) an upside down 'L'.\r\n\r\nmy
    theory here is that the guy making the mould for this concrete monument could
    find the form for the seven so he used an 'L', figuring no one would ever notice.\r\n\r\nIn
    north America, license plates are stamped to produce raised letters. If they are
    similarly made in the UK, then perhaps the person setting the number just rotated
    an 'L' die to make a seven. "

  body: If Splinter comes back to check this thread, he might give us an update on
    how old or modern these plates he saw with this odd character were... AFAIK all
    modern UK licence plates are printed. <em>Really</em> old ones I seem to recall
    may have used stamp & paint...
