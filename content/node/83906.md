  but when I was drafting it in CS5, i don't know why it has sloops in every letter.
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cs5_4662.png]\r\n\r\nBut when I checked
  it on MS office Word, it's as plain as the basic roman letters. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ms
  office_4673.png]\r\n\r\nI just can't figure out if there is a software needed to
  which i could combine the sloops and basic roman letters, like the one's designers
  do. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feel_3807.png]\r\n\r\nThank you so much.."

    you see \xBBOpenType\xAB. You have to unclick the button \xBBswash alternates\xAB,
    \xBBalternate figures\xAB or else. (Don\u2019t know exactly how this is called
    in english). MS Word hasn\u2019t any access to the alternates. \r\n\r\nIf you
    would like to use some of the alternate figures go into the glyph palette and
    choose the glyph you like. "
