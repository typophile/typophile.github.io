    a bit like an expanded, unconnected [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/brody/|Brody]].
    Possibly the crossbar on J is an addition.\r\n\r\nWhere is it from and do you
    have a better sample? Often pictures get posted here that have been manipulated
    to try and get a result from the automated systems like What The Font, but the
    original might be a lot better for us humans."

  body: "So, Brody is fairly close, but (like a lot of the fonts I've seen) the capital
    D isn't quite right. As for the Filmotype Library, if you were talking [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Filmotype|about
    these]], I couldn't see any that were close.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help so far.
    :)\r\n\r\nThe reason I called it a \"signature\" type font is because the font
    was supposed to be someone signing their name. It doesn't look much like a signature,
    I know.\r\n\r\nMy first post has been modified to add the original image I got
    it from. (Sorry, it's the only sample I have, and I don't have any more letters)"

    See here (and follow the links given) for further info:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=231170\r\n\r\nAs
    to your Filmotype link, that references an effort by several folks - spearheaded
    by Stuart Sandler - to digitize the large Filmotype library. They've only scratched
    the surface thus far, though, in this big job."
