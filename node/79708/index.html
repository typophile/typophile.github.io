  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is my first post on the forum. My name is Aaron and I&rsquo;m a Graphic Design student @ Roger Williams University. I just recently tried to clean up and organize all my typefaces on my MAC. I have quite a hefty collection. After not finding out what I&rsquo;m looking for in various searches here, I would like to ask a couple questions about type management.</p>
<p>The first is, Am I better off applying imported type to Suitcase Fusion or allowing Fusion to read from the directory? Every time I attempt to activate a large selection of typefaces, the system gets bogged down and takes forever to activate them.</p>
<p>Secondly, does leaving all the different typefaces within sub folders from the main family slow it down? For instance, if I open up a set like Font Bureau as an overall foundry set and it contains sub-folders for every type family is that OK to do, or am I better off establishing just a single folder for the foundry and drop all the families in that single directory without making sub-directories?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,
Aaron</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>What version of Suitcase Fusion are you running? Whatever version, make sure you have all the latest patches. Suitcase Fusion 3 has better performance than SF2, and some of the updates to SF3 improved performance further, IIRC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why you would even have folders for every family&hellip; that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;Family View&rdquo; is for.  :)  Similarly, you can filter and/or sort by foundry, so I have difficulty imagining a need for a set for each foundry. That being said, with the latest version of the app, you can have many hundreds of sets without any significant performance penalty.</p>
<p>In a couple of places you are using terminology in ways I&rsquo;m not used to, so I don&rsquo;t quite understand the question. I don&rsquo;t understand what &ldquo;applying imported type&rdquo; is&hellip; do you mean importing fonts into Suitcase Fusion versus activating in place? There is no performance advantage from leaving them in place.</p>
<p>You say that activating a &ldquo;large selection&rdquo; of typefaces takes forever. Can you be a bit more specific? How many fonts is &ldquo;a large selection&rdquo;? How long is forever? Otherwise it&rsquo;s hard to know if what you are seeing is unusual, or if the answer is &ldquo;you usually shouldn&rsquo;t try to activate a thousand fonts at once, and if you must, yes it will take quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>T</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas, so I don&rsquo;t require any folder at all just place all families into one directory. And yes I meant by imported type the difference between using the Vault vs Activating in Place.</p>
<p>I own Suitcase Fusion 12.1.7 from when I first purchased my Power Mac in 2007. I don&rsquo;t have the funds to upgrade right now either, I still have OS 10.4.11.</p>
<p>As far as type numbers go, I&rsquo;m talking around 500 and some change families. As you know many type families have a mayriad of weights, thus having quite an extensive list.</p>
<p>I decided recently to revamp everything, before I would activate only what typefaces I required for a document, but I&rsquo;m sick of having to go to Suitcase and activate several fonts when working on an identity design that has an obnoxious amount of initial concepts before I narrow down to what type treatment I&rsquo;m going to select. Or, if I open an annual report I&rsquo;ve been working on and likewise must go hunt down and activate type.</p>
<p>I would like the type to either be all active or have the system be intelligent enough to auto-activate what I require. I believe I have to upgrade both my OS to Leopard in addition to upgrading Fusion to do correct?</p>
<p>Thanks,
Aaron</p>

<p>Suitcase is not auto-activating the type? What application is used to make the annual report?</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, your version of Suitcase should auto-activate for InDesign, Quark, and Illustrator, as long as you&rsquo;ve installed the free plug-ins and so forth. The support section of their site has the details and requirements.</p>
<p>Incidentally, they have a downloadable document called something like &ldquo;best practices for managing fonts&rdquo; at their site. You can probably find using the search box at their site. It&rsquo;s a long document but a good source of info.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, I downloaded the document and re-cleaned the Fusion database. I&rsquo;m using fontdoctor to remove duplicates and grabbing all the type directories and using the organize function to consolidate them to one directory that is organized by foundry, letter, and name.</p>
<p>After I get that all set will then place everything back into Suitcase and hope that gets me where i want to be.</p>
<p>I used InDesign CS4 for the annual report, what are the free plug-ins for auto activating by program moreover, where can I find them for download?</p>

<p>Yes, upgrading Suitcase Fusion to a later version would require OS X 10.5 or 10.6.</p>
