body: "Can anyone recommend some fonts that echo some of the features/character of
  these hand-lettered Alpine ski resort logos? \r\nI know it's a relatively wide field,
  but I'm trying to find something that matches the feel rather than any one exact
  feature\u2026 I'd prefer something monoline/low-contrast and relatively \xABstiff\xBB,
  but not too posh, and connected. A retro touch is totally OK. (So far I can say
  that Monoline Script MT seems not rigid enough, Kursivschrift is too cartographic,
  Roman Script has too much contrast, and Coquette seems too urban/elegant.) Also,
  in fonts that follow a different handwriting tradition than German/Swiss (for instance
  featuring things like the \xABdouble-storey\xBB \"e\"), alternates for German/Swiss
  usage would be a definite plus, since I'm trying to get a \xABlocal\xBB flavor.
  \r\nIt's for a headline/logo, so I'd be OK with some tweaking, I'd just love to
  find something good to start with \u2013 figured maybe somebody here has a spontaneous
  idea.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nGood examples:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftzug_avers_5210.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stoos-logo_3687.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saasfee-logo_6334.jpg]\r\nSemi-successful
  typographic example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CITY_LOGO_772_3745.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, those are some good places to start. I admit I know shamefully little
    about script fonts. I'm liking <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/susa/\">Susa</a>,
    never seen that before. More in such a direction (maybe a hint less soft) would
    be muchly welcome.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"If it\u2019s for a logotype, why not just freely
    drawing it by hand \u2013?\"</cite>\r\nI <em>might</em> end up needing/wanting
    to use the same font for multiple headings; so I'd prefer to first look for a
    font-based solution to give me that flexibility.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"very special requirements,
    indeed!\"</cite>\r\nThanks to Florian Hardwig for pointing out that script fonts
    sometimes do come with locally-specific alternates. The thing is, such local conventions
    can very quickly instill a local flavor that may or may not be appropriate. For
    instance when I see, say, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/ht-maison/\">HT
    Maison</a>, which might otherwise be quite a nice match, its \"e\" immediately
    makes it feel \xABforeign\xBB to me. But on the other hand, such modifications
    of single letters would certainly be within a doable scope."

    You\u2019d need to draw the caps yourself, though."
