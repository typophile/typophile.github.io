body: Today on CBS' show Sunday Morning they had a segment on Tiny Books. These books
  were incredible. Some of them were absolutely tiny I mean the size of finger tips.
  Now as I sat there in amazement I was wondering are there fonts specifically created
  for these books? Are there tiny font designers out there?

  body: There is a printer/bookmaker here in SoCal named Eric Wm. Voss who made some
    tiny books, maybe 1 1/2" - 2" and they were some of the lovliest things I've ever
    laid eyes on that weren't named Scarlet Johansson or something like that.
