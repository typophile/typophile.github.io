  body: 'Syuzi, your sample is a bit too small to be able to identify the  <BR>face
    correctly. It&#39;s pretty close to <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF00690801P2"
    target="_blank"> FF Isonorm</a> if not for the lc &#34;a&#34;,  <BR>but maybe
    that character got distorted by the bitmapping of the  <BR>letter shapes. Also
    I&#39;m not sure what to make of the lc &#34;i&#34;: does it  <BR>have a top serif?
    Any chance of finding a bigger sample?'

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s either of those fonts. Angency is too angular and
    doesn&#39;t have any curves. The bars for Isonorm face are curved rather than
    flat... <BR> <BR>thanks!

    but there&#39;s no way we could see that on  <BR>your smaller sample. <i>Now</i>
    we&#39;re talking business.  <BR>I&#39;ll do some research.

    isn&#39;t it, but it&#39;s damned close. I know the counters are squared off and
    the a isn&#39;t right, but man!

    characters are very easy to  <BR>create, bear in mind this title could very well  <BR>be
    custom drawn.
