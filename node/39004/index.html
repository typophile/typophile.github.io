<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey all,
I'm currently in the process of creating a brand and have become quite fond of [[http://www.identifont.com/show?9XK|Sansa]]. While this takes care of the branding device, I would like to investigate some nice body fonts that can go along with the identity.
I've been looking at Akkurat, but don't really believe that is available to me at this time, so I would like some recommendations up that same avenue (although I would like to avoid Helvetica/Akzidenz Grotesk as I want to instill a sense of originality - even if I'm the only one who notices it). Any gems out there?
Thanks in advance,
Ben</div>

Sophisto or Stalemate both have a bit of character, but all the same formal enough to be part of a brand identity.

He's got some good fonts: I'd certainly be happy for him to point out something in his portfolio that might suit a project I was working on. I don't see him pop up often in the forums with design advice; I'd love to see him share some of his considerable expertise.</div>

They do share a lot, but look closer, starting with the proportions and x-height. And here's Proxima Nova (which preceded Gotham) as another option.

<div class=commentbody>James,
I can assure you I don't have a "generator" for making my suggestions. They are "hand made" for each post. I just try to keep it short instead of putting loads of "bla bla" about my own typefaces. It's just so much about different taste and t's much quicker and easier for people judging themselves. I agree it's a sort of low budget "guerilla advertising", but as an independent type designer, you to make some noise... I'm just surprised that it haven't been used by many more ;-)
Gary,
I wish I could spend more time sharing ideas and input on design topics etc. I've actually been thinking of cloning myself, but my wife tells me one is perfectly enough... and god forbid I might start double-posting!
Cheers</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stefan, my objection to your guerilla advertising is two-fold. First, it is embarrassingly desperate. Are your sales so slow that your advertising plan is to reach the few hundred visitors of this website? Second, it is annoying. You are the Jehovah's Witness of the type world, knocking on doors with your sales pitch. (And I like some of your work!)
It's not just you, either. It has come up that Stephen Coles is employed by FontShop, and they seem to pay him to suggest fonts available from them on this site. If he just posted "I work for FontShop. Here are some fonts we sell which you might be interested in." It would be like the nice shirt and tie which Jehovah's Witnesses wear, which allow you to spot them before you open the door.

<div class=commentbody>James -- FontShop sees very few sales from Typophile traffic. I point to fonts at our site because I know the library well and have scripts which ease searching and linking. I think you'll find that the fonts in my posts are not limited to FS.
But that's beside the point. If you are that annoyed by people recommending fonts for which they might have a financial interest, then I submit that Typophile is probably not for you. If the suggestions were superfluous and unhelpful, I could see your complaint, but your metaphor is flawed: Jehovah's Witnesses offer <em>unsolicited</em> advice.</div>

The suggestions posted by Auricfuzz and Stephen Coles are helpfully Helvetica/AG-like. (And my apologies to Mr Coles. I see that he has linked to non-FontShop fonts.)
However, take a look at Stalemate and Sophisto. If those are anything like Akkurat, Helvetica, or AG, I will eat my own hat.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James,
Too bad you get so annoyed by my "harmless" posts. In fact I'm surprised they would stir up anything to begin with? You are the first to say so. I might not be on target at all times, but many here have found my "recommendations" sometimes useful for other projects or just happy to discover some new faces in the "ocean". Comparing me with Jehovah’s Witness is to me hilarious. When I was young,,, they sometimes came knocking on my door, typically early on a Sunday morning! I have "scared" them away twice showing them my hammer of Thor, saying something about I'm NOT Christian! ;-)
As for living on type, I'm doing pretty well. I still do logotypes, graphic identities, graphic design for Greenpeace, but mostly because I still love doing it and it's a good way of mixing both type and design. But I'm almost independent from just royalties and custom typefaces.
Regarding Stephen Coles, I find it very low to accuse him for being a salesman for FS! Yes he works for them and "EVERYONE" here knows it, but he's passionate about type and his knowledge is without any doubt! The Typosphere would be dull without him! I feel honoured to have become his friend over the years.
LOVE, PEACE & UNDERSTANDING!</div>

Etc. Etc.
Beyond the Jehovah's Witness-style salesmanship, my objection lies in the fact that Stefan H suggests his fonts when they are entirely unlike what the person is looking for. Stefan does not deny that he is not on target at all times; maybe he could think a little bit before posting. If he signs up with FontShop to have them distribute his fonts, Stephen Coles will do it for him!</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you're going to recommend fonts, perhaps you should declare your financial interest in a signature to the post, if it's not apparent from your username.
Like many contributors to Typophile, Stephen wears several typo hats (eg Typographica and TypeCon), so his posts on various issues here are not necessarily *glyph pushing* (as he terms it) for FontShop.
I recommend <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/brown/>Brown,</a> which is (so far) my take on the grotesque genre.

The OP said he’s looking for <cite>Grotesque text typefaces</cite> and likes <cite>to <strong>avoid</strong> Helvetica/Akzidenz Grotesk</cite>.
Stefan didn’t claim that his are yet some other Swiss modern grotesques, but, quite the contrary, clearly specified that they <cite>have a bit of character.</cite>

(Given the fact that most people won’t notice the difference between Helvetica and Univers)
It’s neither Wellington boots nor \/iάgra nor unsolicited proselytization, you know. Just a link. You don’t <em>have</em> to follow it.
And before this thread becomes totally off-topic, I’ll add some more suggestions:

<a href=http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-590-zeppelin-32>Zeppelin</a>

<div class=commentbody>I'm being pig-headed about this, and Florian Hardwig is being pig-headed about this. The difference is: I'm right.
The original post clearly asked for suggestions for a grotesque text alternative to Akkurat, which is not Helvetica/A.G.
Maurea, Zeppelin, and Axiom are alternatives to Frutiger, Interstate, and Frankling Gothic, respectively.
Here's another of my Platonic dialogues for my fans:
Benski: "I’ve been looking at Akkurat, but don’t really believe that is available to me at this time, so I would like some recommendations up that same avenue (although I would like to avoid Helvetica/Akzidenz Grotesk as I want to instill a sense of originality - even if I’m the only one who notices it). Any gems out there?"
Stefan H: "I don't have anything like that in my collection, so I'll just keep quiet."
Benski: "I've got another project where I've been using Klavika, but am not sure I like it. Can anyone suggest some replacements?"
Stefan H: "Perhaps you might like Stalemate or Sophisto."
See how that works?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey all, thanks for the replies. Didn't know this post would spark such controversy!
For the initial proposal I'm sticking with Akzidenz Grotesk, as I didn't realise OurType's EULA didn't allow outlining (I am aware this is common, silly me didn't check) so I have to make arrangements with my printer.
I do however like the suggestion of using typefaces within OurType's library, I will follow that up and try to squeeze a bit more budget out of the client.
Although... Flama is very nice indeed (thanks David, Chris). I'm still a bit new to this, so would anyone be able to tell me if purchasing this allows me to outline? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Dude. I can't believe that an interesting discussion about grotesque fonts somehow turned into a flame war involving innocent bystanders.
First of all, I happen to BE one of Jehovah's Witnesses.
Second, JWs, like all people, have differing individual levels of tact. I, for instance, never knock on a door before 10AM and never ring a doorbell before 11AM. If someone isn't interested in talking, I thank them for their time, wish them a good day, then take my leave.
Third, Stefan H can post his fonts wherever he wants, because they are good fonts. He's never pushy, never puts out a giant sales pitch. Just, "Hey, maybe such-and-such will be exactly what you're looking for."
Finally, let's keep the discussion focused on the fonts, eh? People really start to show their ignorance when they start discussing religion without even a baseline understanding of the subject and a smidgin of tact.
We're font people, people.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, it's a cheap shot to throw an insult the way of a particular group, when you assume that none of that group are present -- or related to members of said group, and so on...
Dan, how do you feel about the "worst typeface" hater thread, given that it disses Typophilers who are responsible for designing some of the faces mentioned?</div>

Yeah, I noticed that too, it's getting kinda old. I posted that in the thread as well, a link to a thread of not to long ago which was practically the same.
Yet, it seems most of the people still like threads like that, because it has over 100 posts, which is a lot...</div>

<div class=commentbody>That, and the "best ever" threads. How about if we do a thread on the most average typeface ever? those that have no strong or weak points but just kind of sit there without pleasing or annoying a single soul?

<div class=commentbody>This has been one of the more enjoyable threads I've read in my brief time as a member. I like NewGuy's humor. I also agree that some of the type designers here wear mink fur coats and plumed hats. Too much pimping! I will, however, turn on a dime if a pimp sends a cute redhead my way, or one of the designers sends me a family license to the typeface of my choosing. I can (cheaply) be bought.

Hey buddy, you looking for a scotch roman? Egyptians are not normally as cute and they use henna.
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>@pattyfab <em>“Wow, Maquette is nearly identical to H&FJ's Gotham - ever so slightly more condensed and with a double-storey a.”</em>
That may be, only ARS Maquette was designed about a year earlier (1999) than Gotham, and was first released/introduced to the public by ARS Type (on the old website) in mid 2001 with a pretty substantial announcement in the typographic circle.
Just to clarify any possible confusion.
