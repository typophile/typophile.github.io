  type foundry creates computer typefaces inspired  by Art, History, and sometimes
  science. P22 is renowned for its work with museums and foundations to ensure the
  development of accurate historical typefaces that are fully relevant for today's
  computer user.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its in-house font design, P22 now licenses
  several new type designs from around the world with [[IHOF|International House of
  Fonts]]. P22 grew further with the addition of the [[Sherwood Type Collection|Sherwood
  Type Collection]]. In late 2004, P22 aquired [[Lanston Type Co.|Lanston Type Co.]]
  And in early 2006 P22 launched the [[Rimmer Type Foundry]]. \r\n\r\nP22 has been
  involved in a number of other projects including publishing the [[Indie Fonts|Indie
  Fonts]] series of books through its [[P-Type Publications|P-Type Publications]]
  \ division. Finally, we're sure you agree that no type foundry is complete without
  its own record label, Atom Smash Records.\r\n\r\nWebsites: \r\n<a href=\"http://www.p22.com\">P22
