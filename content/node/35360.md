body: "We are looking for a new font for our consumer parenting magazine. We currently
  use Spira as our primary serif body font but dislike that it looks too hand-cut
  and has an overall folksy feeling. What we are looking for is a cleaner and more
  open font, but still based in classic typography. It is also important for it to
  have a fairly extensive family and  includes beautiful ligatures.\r\nWe love the
  look of Sterling, by Hoefler & Frere-Jones in the AIGA Design Archive, but it is
  unavailable for purchase. Could anyone suggest a similar font? The ones we have
  found and are considering thus far are Whitman, Miller, and Eason.\r\nThanks so
  much in advance!"

    has certain similarities to Sterling. Indeed, Sterling may have used Perpetua
    as an inspiration. Sterling looks more 'refined' than Perpetua IMO. It is gorgeous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "Kent Lew is working on display variants of Whitman, due out soon.... \r\n\r\nSterling
    does look like it was influenced by Perpetua. Perpetua, while older and established,
    is not commonly used. It would be distinctive in a magazine, though probably a
    little light. "

  body: "Liz --\r\n\r\nHey, are you working with <em>Family Fun</em> and the Impress
    folks over in that round building in Northampton, by any chance? I'm just an hour
    west of you over here in Berkshire county.\r\n\r\nHere are a few Whitman settings
    for direct comparison with the Sterling jpgs. The display is set in the Regular
    weight, with one line of Light at the end for comparison. (There will be seven
    weights and three widths total in the family.) The retail release should be ready
    in the next couple weeks, I hope . . .\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitmDisplay_5833.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
    are also a few additions to the text family that are being prepped for retail
    release. Bold Italic, Semibold and Semibold Italic fonts will soon be available.\r\n\r\nThis
    image shows the three weights.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitmText_6470.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    pulled these together pretty quickly, so the lo-res rasterization leaves a bit
    to be desired. If you want to see Whitman in a context more comparable to what
    you're doing, look for a copy of <em>Brides</em> magazine. They use Whitman for
    feature text (granted, it can be a little tricky to find amid all the ads and
    all the Relay sans serif). They also have original versions of some of the Display
    weights that they use here and there.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can answer any questions
    about Whitman to help in your consideration.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "I love Perpetua but I have to caution you against it if you're using InDesign.
    The optical and metric kerning pairs are pretty dodgy, especially in the Italic.
    Since InD doesn't have the kerning tables option (grrrr!) you'd have to go in
    and tweak the font itself. I just used it for a book and had to do a lot of manual
    kerning, quite time consuming. \r\n\r\nI have the Adobe Perpetua from 1998 - it's
    possible the Linotype version is better - unless they're the same. \r\n\r\nSterling
    is pretty - it's reminding me of something else - tip of my tongue...\r\nWhitman's
    great too."

  body: "Scaling is an issue for Perpetua.\r\nIt gets a bit thin at small sizes.\r\nSo
    it may be worthwhile, if you're after the effect of finesse, to opt for a typeface
    that has some size-specific variants.\r\nThat gives you more flexibility in your
    layouts."
