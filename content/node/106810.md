  anyone know what this font is?  Or can you suggest something similar that's not
  too expensive or ideally free! Laura Mvula is a UK singer, I love the font to use
  for my bridal business x\r\n\r\nRyuk solved this and the font is Archer"

    body: thank you so much!  I think that's the one, a little out of my price range
      for now but i've gone with St Marie as a free alternative and will purchase
      this one once I have the budget as it's just the perfect balance of formal and
      elegant with a whimsical feel that I wanted... nowhere has a slab serif with
      the round ball S's that Arhcer has :( xx
