    why I'm confused. \r\n\r\nI'm starting to wonder if you're here to mock graphic
    designers."

    comment or not. Then another 10 to think of what to say - this is the one time
    I've been left speechless!\r\n\r\n<cite>Your fine art is very nice.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think the word I would use is cool ;)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Your second version looks like
    it needs a little more pizzazz."

    lose points for not using either Comic Sans or Zapf Chancery in all caps though
    (good call, Patty) however.\r\nAside from a few filters left untouched, you still
    make a great chance of winning this round!"
