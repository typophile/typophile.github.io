    <BR>but in the meantime, would you humour me? these are part of the longhorn core
    fonts, right? and they&#39;ll in opentype format? it&#39;s sounding good. <BR>

  body: Yes that&#39;s the plan, I&#39;ll be sure to post an announcement here when
    more details are available online.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have the book with me,
    so I don&#39;t want to paraphrase exactly what it says about how  the fonts will
    be distributed. <BR> <BR>The term &#39;core fonts&#39; has a pretty specific meaning
    for us, the core fonts fonts being TNR, Arial, Courier New, Symbol and Wingdings.  <BR>

  body: Si I&#39;ve not read the book yet, only looked at the specimens of type. How
    and when will these typefaces be incorporated? They are very nice, but then why
    wouldn&#39;t they be with the people who designed them.

  body: 'The new ClearType type families were specifically designed for Longhorn &#40;the
    next version of Windows&#41;. As the book explains, the designs take advantage
    of impressive new features of the version of the ClearType renderer that will
    ship with Longhorn: subpixel positioning and y-direction anti-aliasing. That said,
    they look pretty darn fine with the current version of the renderer: I&#39;ve
    been using Gary Munch&#39;s Candara as my e-mail font for several months now,
    Luc&#39;s Consolas for all monospaced text, my own Constantia as default web font,
    and Jeremy&#39;s Corbel as a UI font. <BR> <BR>An online version of the book,
    with extra graphic material will be available at some stage, but we&#39;re not
    actively working on this at the moment. <BR> <BR>[I&#39;m still sampling the Internet

  body: Thank you, John. Very lazy of me, the book sits here next to me. I should&#39;ve
    opened it up and read it first.
