  body: "Fordscript does not match the logo.\r\nFordscript is a clumsy version of
    M.F. Benton's Commercial Script of 1908.\r\nThe main original feature of Fordscript
    is the _r_.\r\nFordscript is closer to the Bitstream digital version in width
    to height ratio etc than to the versions produced by Linotype and others.\r\nDon"
