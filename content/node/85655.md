  body: "Hi Henri,\r\n\r\nI'm not a font designer but I'm Greek and although I don't
    know which is this typeface, I wonder why one should have to use one of the ugliest
    Greek Polytonic (=multi-accent) typefaces I have ever seen!\r\n\r\nEspecially
    the accents are awfully designed:\r\n2nd letter: The Vareia accent should point
    to the horizontal center of the eta (\u03B7) letter, not to the next letter!\r\n5th
    letter: The Perispomeni accent should be much lower and more close to the eta
    (\u03B7) letter\r\n15th & 27th letter: The Psili accent should be centered above
    ypsilon (\u03C5) and epsilon (\u03B5) letter.\r\n\r\nIf the specific font is not
    a absolute requirement I will highly recommend to replace it with another.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GreekPoly02_5852.jpg]\r\n\r\nLook
    at the image I have attached, to see how different is the same text if you use
    a well designed Greek Polytonic Text (GFS Didot).\r\n\r\nFivos"
