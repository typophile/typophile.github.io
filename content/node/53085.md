  Wagner and his typefaces, in particular in Aurora Grotesk (released by the C.E.
  Weber foundry around 1912 or earlier).\r\nIf there is some resource I'd like to
  know more about the C.E. Weber foundry, and the whereabouts of Wagner's work.\r\n\r\nI
  have checked most of what's available on the web but I haven't found so much, apart
  from the informations provided by Linotype on their site:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/630/johanneswagnerfoundry.html\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  I do not understand German, but I would be grateful for any suggestion or indication
  of offline resources."

    typedesigner, but of a foundry. Johannes was the son of Ludwig Wagner. One of
    Wagner\u2019s companies folded in 1942 and some of their materials were taken
    over by C.E. Weber in Stuttgart. Johannes Wagner moved his foundry from Leipzig
    in East Germany to Ingolstadt in the West, shortly after World War II. (Ingolstadt
    is a town in Bavaria, today also the home of Audi). The company existed as Letternservice
    Ingolstadt until 2002. The remaining equipment is now in the Museum f\xFCr Druckkunst
    in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know much else of the top of my head, but if you
    search for Letternservice etc, you\u2019ll find stuff. Perhaps all in German,
    but that is what we speak over here."

    | James Mosley\u2019s blog]]:\r\n\r\n\xB6 Johannes Wagner, Ingolstadt *\r\nAlso
    known as \u2018Letternservice Ingolstadt\u2019. The foundry incorporates several
    firms which originated in Wagner & Schmidt, matrix makers, established in Leipzig
    in 1875. Johannes Wagner (1888\u20131965) transferred his foundry from Berlin
    to Ingolstadt in 1949. In 1971 it acquired a large part of the materials of C.
    E. Weber, Stuttgart. In 1978 the foundry took over the current production of H.
    Berthold, Berlin, casting types from ori ginal matrices which are held in the
    foundry.\r\nThe foundry is reported to have ceased casting type for sale: an account
    of its current status and that of its materials would be welcome.\r\nEinhundert

  body: "Erik, thank you so much. I appreciate a lot!\r\n\r\nI have already found
    most of the things on the web, including Mosley, but I'll check also for \"Letternservice
    Ingolstadt\".\r\n\r\nNow, main questions:\r\n\r\n- Who is the actual designer
    of Aurora Grotesk? I understand Wagner and family run the Schriftgie\xDFerei,
    which bear their name, but Aurora is credited to him, and seems to be a C.E. Weber
    release from 1912 (but I have strong reasons to believe it came out earlier, and
    it's a key point in my research, which is related to Italian type designs).\r\n\r\n-
    There is also Romana, a typeface which is credited to Gustav F. Schroeder, and
    the date reported is 1892, but it is also credited as a Wagner face from 1930.
    May it be that the Wagners re-cast it and added weights to the family?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I also wrote to the Museum and I am waiting for a reply.\r\n\r\nMany thanks again!"
