  I understand.I'm particularly interested in this article: Modern hebrew typefaces,
  Henri Friedlaender. If you have it, would you be willing to take pictures of or
  scan those spreads? :) I'd willing to offer some modest compensation if that's necessary.\r\n\r\nI
  have found copies for sale around $150 US, which is a little more than I'd like
  to unpocket at this point."

    handful of universities that have it.  Near you (assuming that your profile is
    accurate) the closest I see is University of Missouri, Columbia.
