  body: "Cowboy boots are not only functional and practical; they can also be the
    inspiration for many different art forms.Choose from boots in fun colors like
    pink or red, or in the classic colors like black or brown.  Great styling available
    here from the basic boot to the glitzy light up styles. Boys boot styles are made
    to look rough and tough from looking plain to the look of snakeskin just like
    daddy's boots. \r\n<a href=\"http://KidsCowboyBoots.org/\">Kids Cowboy Boots</a>"
