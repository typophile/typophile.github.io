<p>In the end, there&rsquo;s 1 winner and a bunch of losers. So the organizers effectively ask all but one participant to work for free. So just ask yourself if you want to get involved with people that think this is an acceptable arrangement (even if you are OK with not winning and writing off the time spent on this).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m opposed to spec work too, although in this case I assume that losing entries would still be marketable fonts, unlike many design contests (like designing a poster for an event) where a losing entry can&rsquo;t easily be repurposed.</p>
<p>I can understand the appeal of a contest to someone just starting out, or if there&rsquo;s a big prize (which isn&rsquo;t typical), but in general spec work is an odd setup that&rsquo;s virtually unheard of in other professions. If you asked ten accountants to do your taxes and you&rsquo;ll only pay the one who got you the biggest refund, you&rsquo;d get laughed at. Same thing in most other professions. Professionals should be paid for their work.</p>

<p>I think spec work is bad for only part of the design industry: the establishment, that wants to make sure there are affordable beginners to recruit (read: indenture) who are not afforded shortcuts to success. To me that&rsquo;s worse than an organization allowing non-establishment people to potentially get taken advantage of.</p>
<p>The main problem with things like this is usually that the people choosing the winner suck. But that&rsquo;s fixable to a good extent.</p>

<p>Note that this competition is not being organised or even endorsed by any government entity: it is an initiative of the University of Canberra. This means, of course, that not only is it spec work that you have to pay to have considered by the judges, there is no guarantee that the winning selection will ever be used in any official capacity as the typeface of the city, although the university will assume &lsquo;an exclusive, royalty-free and irrevocable license in perpetuity&rsquo; for the so-called winner.</p>
<p>Hrant, the design <em>profession</em> opposes spec work because it undermines the profession as a whole when people work for nothing. It creates an environment in which customers and clients expect and then demand free work. It encourages the structuring of what should be fairly paid creative labour as &lsquo;competitions&rsquo;, which are simply a way for corporations and other institutions to avoid paying proper fees to designers (and in some cases actually collect fees from them!)</p>
<p>Your attempts to draw parallels with sporting competitions do not work, because generally speaking athletes are not being asked to invest in training, practice, equipment, etc. in order to participate in competitions: they are doing these things for the sake of participation in their chosen sports and the competitions exist to provide a showcase. If the athletes are professionals, they are paid for their participation, not for winning (although in some sports there are bonuses for winners); if they are amateurs then they are not paid whether they win or not.</p>
<p>A better parallel would be this: ten people pay a fee to be allowed to work in a restaurant kitchen, they all work a nine hour shift, and then the chef decides which one of them will be paid. That should sound ridiculous, but something like it probably happens &ndash; perhaps advertised as a &lsquo;competitive internship&rsquo; &ndash;, because businesses are constantly trying to organise the labour market in a way that suits them rather than suits workers. To which I say ORGANISE! &hellip;and if that means that professional design associations, like other forms of guild or union, prevent their members from engaging in spec work, that&rsquo;s a fair restriction to make for the good of the profession.</p>

<p>Oh, you mean like Unger&rsquo;s Capitolum and LettError&rsquo;s Twin? :-)  Note BTW that Capitolum now has a great life. Any &ldquo;losing&rdquo; font from this competition could too.</p>
<p>You explain yourself well, but I just don&rsquo;t buy that official party line (and I don&rsquo;t think you should equate &ldquo;the profession&rdquo; with all its members). I maintain that only the big boys (and those dreaming of being among them one day) really suffer from the existence of spec work. And the big boys determine what position AIGA etc. take.</p>
<p>BTW, I think your restaurant scenario is just fine (it&rsquo;s just that kitchens aren&rsquo;t usually big enough for such parallelism; if they were it would save time). But the winner won&rsquo;t just be paid for those nine hours, he&rsquo;ll be given a job, presumably because he deserves it.</p>

<p>Your notion that &lsquo;only the big boys&rsquo; &ndash; who they? &ndash; suffer from spec work is laughable. If they&rsquo;re that big, they probably aren&rsquo;t suffering at all.

<p>the shortcut to success threatens the pool of 
desperate but talented beginners</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An unemployed beginner wouldn&rsquo;t turn down a job at a design firm so he could continue entering spec contests. You can&rsquo;t make a living working spec; most of time you&rsquo;ll lose and get nothing, and contests with big payoffs are rare.</p>
<p>Professionals oppose spec work for a number of reasons, but I think the fundamental one is that if it isn&rsquo;t opposed it may someday become a common practice even with everyday jobs. Doing an occasional spec job in your spare time is one thing, but trying to work that way for a living isn&rsquo;t practical since you won&rsquo;t get paid for most of the hours you work.</p>

But there are two &ldquo;good&rdquo; reasons design firms oppose it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a beginner wins recognition, his price goes up.* The more than happens, the more money the firms have to spend hiring.</li>
<li>A spec bid takes the place of a traditional bid = less money for the design firm.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kudos to them for being responsive and reasonable. If they indeed got enough such complaints, I wonder if that means many people who are supposedly against &ldquo;spec work&rdquo; will now secretly enter&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>Now if they can only be convinced to give back the entry fees in some generous way (see below); it&rsquo;s probably too late, but it would have been better to lower the award amount and do that.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I remain unconvinced that &ldquo;spec work&rdquo; reduces overall earnings, especially in type design. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>A typeface, being a tool and not an end-product, is eminently re-purposable.</li>
<li>In this case the winner gets ~$10K for three years of exclusivity, which isn&rsquo;t bad for many people. Not every type designer lives in the West&hellip;</li>
<li>Many organizations can&rsquo;t justify the sorts of budgets* that large studios demand (because they have a lot of expenses, like a clothing store in Beverly Hills versus one that sells the same stuff in Downey) but they can afford ~$10K. Imagine every city about the size of Canberra or larger paying for a typeface (that can be resold after a few years) - that&rsquo;s a lot of money coming into the field (it just doesn&rsquo;t end up in the pockets of the big studios). Remember, most people still think all fonts are supposed to be free&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I remember how people were outraged that British Airways paid $100K for their custom typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p>This anti-spec talk reminds me of the classical delusion that font piracy has a large impact on income. There is no evidence, only protectionist paranoia, promulgated by the big players.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the entry fee, and there&rsquo;s actually a good reason not to make entry free: they would be swamped. HOWEVER there was a better way to handle it, so they don&rsquo;t look like cheapskates: pass along all the entry fees to the winner (or distribute it among honorable mentions) or donate it to SoTA, ATypI or a local typographic non-profit.</p>

<p>Is that a rhetorical question? Of course they do. It’s called “funded R&amp;D.”</p>
<p>And if car a company <em>does</em> put a shout out to the tune of “design us some parts, but if we don’t use them, you don’t get paid” that’s still garbage spec work.</p>

<p>Because they did the job they were hired to do.</p>
<p>Anytime you hire a consultant — whether it&rsquo;s a designer, accountant, architect, business consultant, or whatever — there&rsquo;s a chance you won&rsquo;t like the results. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to chose the consultant carefully.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some are missing the bigger picture here:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve merely accepted and adopted the doctrine that anything that adds to the Gross Domestic Product of the marketplace is a good thing. But since automation has replaced human labor in the agriculture, mining, and manufacturing sectors, human labor has shifted toward services. Services now accounts for 72% of the global output. But exactly how effective is the output? Harvard Business Review published a paper, as an example, that showed US markets spending US$ 50 billion in &ldquo;change management consulting&rdquo; services&hellip; and that a full 70% of those services failed in their original objectives.</p>
<p>The reason services often fail in their objectives is that we live (and produce/consume) believing that &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; is the key of success. Quantity of apples. Quantity of cars.</p>
<p>But, in services&hellip; &ldquo;quality&rdquo;, not quantity is the key to success. Problem is, we don&rsquo;t know how to do &ldquo;quality&rdquo;&hellip; we are still stuck in Marx&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;labor value&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>And BTW, very little of today&rsquo;s US intellectual property originates from &ldquo;funded R&amp;D&rdquo;&hellip; Stanford University, as an example receives no federal funding of consequence. The bulk of its funding comes from commercialized intellectual property (such as 2% of all IBM Global Services revenues). I wrote the business plan and contract.</p>
<p>And, if I remember correctly, the Dutch retailer Designstoel24 a few months ago, ran a facebook campaign to redesign their logo:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Designerchairs24">http://www.facebook.com/Designerchairs24</a></p>
<p>And here is an example of crowd-sourced creativity:
<a href="http://99designs.com/">http://99designs.com/</a></p>
<p>So, how to compete with the future? Or, do you hold on tight to orthodoxy for as long as you can?</p>

<p>Are you implying that professional, experienced designers can&rsquo;t do quality work? That&rsquo;s news to the thousands of designers who make a good living and have happy clients.</p>
<p>Does a university pick the one &ldquo;best&rdquo; professor to pay in each department and the rest get nothing?  Does a retail store pick the one &ldquo;best&rdquo; employee to pay and the rest get nothing? Of course not. People are hired to do a job and they get paid for their work.</p>
<p>Organizations asking for spec work think they are getting a great deal, but generally they aren&rsquo;t. Most participants will be beginners or designers having trouble making a living. A professional designer with a successful business has little reason to enter a contest. It&rsquo;s simply not a practical way to make a living. And rarely does winning a spec contest carry any prestige.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The reality is that you can&rsquo;t never pay people (although I will point out that in many countries -where people don&rsquo;t have a lot of expenses, and have family members who can support them- people do go unpaid for <em>months</em> because it&rsquo;s better to go to work than simply offer your job to somebody more desperate) but you can certainly not pay them when they&rsquo;re initially proving themselves. As Michael implies, you have to adapt to reality.</p>
<p>I think an organization can indeed get good results from spec work (hey, good results aren&rsquo;t even guaranteed when you hire a big studio, plus you&rsquo;ve spent a ton more money) as long as they have qualified people choosing the winner. This is admittedly usually lacking.</p>
<p>Let me ask -again- what do people think of the Oak Knoll logo? They paid $500 <em>store credit</em> for it. It&rsquo;s peanuts, but it&rsquo;s better than not being able to afford Landor.</p>
<p>Also, again, when it comes to type design attempting a spec bid isn&rsquo;t very wasteful at all; unless it&rsquo;s a very unusual project the results are usually entirely re-usable. Plus remember, in this case it&rsquo;s only for three years.</p>

<p>I certainly do not imply that &ldquo;professional&rdquo; (insert any occupation here) do not do quality work. But Francis Ford Coppola once commented about &ldquo;professional&rdquo; film-making that he dreams of the day when “One day some little fat girl in Ohio is going to be the new Mozart.”</p>
<p>See short video clip here:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSePbQVR284">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSePbQVR284</a></p>
<p>In short, you need to get over your ego that you or anyone else is a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and thus, better than some &ldquo;non-professional&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>The world is full of Mozarts&hellip; and by the way&hellip; they are transforming the world&hellip;</p>
<p>Watch out! THEY are coming !</p>
<p>Oh yeah&hellip; to neatly tie two threads together: Papyrus typeface may not be the preferred cup of tea by so-called &ldquo;professionals&rdquo;, but I have yet to hear anyone from 20th Century Fox or even &ldquo;non-professional&rdquo; audience members complain that Papyrus was a crappy choice for the Poster design&hellip;</p>

<p>The only orthodoxy worth bringing forward is the tried and true. Recognize exploitation for what it is and who it benefits and who gets run over.</p>
<p>How many people earn a living responding to RFPs day in and day out &hellip;that&rsquo;s the proof. Our way of life &hellip; that is the change of money for staple goods (ie food, hydro, etc.,) is built on the foundation that all people can earn a living.</p>
<p>So, answer the question &hellip; how many people earn a living responding to RFPs day in and day out? Of those 4,695 RFPs per week that you cite &hellip;how many of those who respond to those RFPs earn a living from doing spec work? That business &lsquo;model&rsquo; is obviously unsustainable.

Papyrus wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bad choice if people complained; Papyrus <em>was</em> a bad choice because it cheapens the end-result (since it&rsquo;s so over-used). Consider that Cameron paid $100K for a language to be invented for Avatar, and that made the movie better; nobody would have complained if he had just used English. But it was still a great investment. A custom -or at least rare- font would have been the same.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Francis Ford Coppola, and that&rsquo;s an interesting clip. But what he was saying was that modern technology makes it possible for non-professionals to make movies on a shoestring budget, and thus new talent may come from unexpected places. I agree totally, but I don&rsquo;t see it having much bearing on this discussion about the ethics of spec work.</p>
<p>And incidentally, Francis Ford Coppola is a &ldquo;professional&rdquo;, a category you seem to hold in low regard. And he&rsquo;s done very well, with international fame and fortune and he lives on vineyard he owns in Napa Valley, which I visited a few years ago (he&rsquo;s got a nice museum of movie artifacts). His daughter is also a talented professional filmmaker.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, buddy, your myopic understanding of nation building leaves me kinda feeling sorry for you. If you at all are interested in contributing to a healthy growing society then you must be aware of &hellip;taxes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s back up a moment and consider the big picture. Tuff stuff like government money going to the unemployed, government money going to food stamps, government money going to pay for a nation of people needing medical expenses. That takes a certain percentage of people working all the time with a guaranteed income.</p>
<p>Spec work undermines all of that. It undermines health care, it undermines unemployment payments, and whole host of other norms.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because with spec work &hellip; crowdsourcing &hellip; their is no guaranteed income. You can work all you like &hellip; but you won&rsquo;t get paid. Out of a thousand people who work for a crowdsourced RFP &hellip; only person will get paid. Meanwhile 999 people have no money and will therefore pay no taxes. Ergo the government raises no revenue from those nine hundred and ninety nine people! In fact they will grain the government&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>You want Obama care &hellip; pay for it!! You want unemployment benefits &hellip; pay for it!! You want transportation infrastructures &hellip;pay for it!! Spec work &hellip; crowdsourcing &hellip; only benefits the very very few and undermines a whole society of workers and their families.</p>
<p>It is you Hrant, that is confused. You are confusing a person&rsquo;s ability to do any sort of work with a person&rsquo;s VALUE of generating an income &hellip; spec work only pays 1 person out of a 1,000 who work in hopes of payment for their services. 1 and only 1!</p>
<p>Furthermore, in any competition that me or my friends have participated in (my friends play tournament chess and some play online poker too), there is always a prize amount payed out to the others who place finish &hellip; 2nd, 3rd, etc.. Does spec work even do that much?</p>
<p>Spec work will only undermine a healthy society &hellip; and it amazes me why it hasn&rsquo;t been taken up on the Congressional level.</p>

What I AM attempting to communicate is that each one of us possesses MULTIPLE gifts, MULTIPLE opportunities to contribute to society&hellip; not simply via some outdated notion of a &ldquo;specialized title&rdquo;&hellip; a lawyer who in any specific moment might design a logo or font is just as capable, just as gifted (potentially) as Mathew Carter&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe to put this in somewhat metaphysical terms: we are all radio transmitters&hellip; capable of receiving and transmitting energy&hellip; no matter the energy&hellip;</p>
<p>There is an interesting Dutch documentary, &ldquo;The Sea That Thinks&rdquo; (if I remember correctly). The film-makers ask the question of people on the street: &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;&hellip; the standard answers ensued: I&rsquo;m a lawyer, or carpenter, waiter, etc&hellip; but we are not THAT.. we are more than our professions&hellip; we are the greater than the sum of our parts&hellip;</p>
<p>Defining yourself as a specific type of professional is simply degrading yourself&hellip; you have much greater potential than that&hellip;</p>

<p>In terms of type design, this is nonsense. In part, this is because it is a craft, not an art. Being a craft, there are substantial elements that are objective.</p>
<p>It is true that people can have multiple talents and interests. But a big part of type design skill is only possible through learning. No amount of raw inspiration can make up for ignorance of key principles. It is not like painting in that regard.</p>
<p>For my part, I am a significantly worse type designer than I could be, simply because I don’t do more of it. That is a choice I have made, but I am always aware that I could be better at it if I devoted more time to it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas&hellip; I respect your talents and experience as a craftsman&hellip; and the world is full of wonderful and responsible examples of not simply good craftspeople, but of really hard work to perfect one&rsquo;s craft&hellip; Michael Jordan, as an example was one of the most gifted athletes alive, yet he worked exceptionally hard on practicing his craft. Like I said, I can and do respect this.</p>
<p>But&hellip; what is also true that a 4 year old child can play Mozart masterfully&hellip; there are indeed people who possess something greater than a craft: no limitations.</p>
<p>Your mind has told you that you haven&rsquo;t yet perfected your craft. That is only your mind. &ldquo;Let go Luke! Let the force guide you!&rdquo; as a fictional character once said&hellip; or various historical entities have also said throughout the ages in a bit different language.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I was a business consultant, and happened to have had a client in Alaska. I flew from Denver to Anchorage, and met with the owner and staff. One of the salesmen raised his hand, and asked &ldquo;are you going to teach me how to sell to the local market here in Anchorage?&rdquo; My answer was of course, no&hellip; only he could know the nuances of his local market. But what I was able to teach him over the course of a few days was that &ldquo;the business&rdquo; was a hell of a lot more textured than just his salesmanship&hellip; there was the backoffice&hellip; there was bank relationships&hellip; there was industry influences&hellip; it was only his ego that was getting in the way&hellip; he thought HE was the center of the business&hellip; but the business had a lot of moving parts other than himself&hellip; in the weeks and months that followed, his sales increased exponentially because he saw a bigger picture&hellip;</p>
<p>Type designers are no different. Your egos simply get in the way sometimes. There is a bigger picture. And it has NOTHING AT ALL to do with your craft. It is something else.</p>
<p>BTW, I wonder how the typeface design for Canberra is going?</p>

<p>You do not have to be a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; to possess a gift&hellip; is this boy only an exception? Or are our closed minds the exception?</p>
<p>And there are no lazy morons. There are indeed people who simply do not understand how to access their gifts and shine them forth. I was living in England during the time that M. Thatcher was closing the &lsquo;non-productive&rsquo; mines, and I traveled around the country interviewing whole villages&hellip; listening to stories was an incredible experience.

World War II soldiers who performed acts of bravery, courage, and innovation&hellip; but when they were younger at home, they were lazy or non-motivated&hellip; it sometimes takes changing one&rsquo;s environment to be faced with who you really are.

<p>Michael said &lsquo;Quality is in the eye of the beholder&rsquo;, and Thomas rightly took issue with this on the sensible grounds that in type design there are plenty of objective criteria of quality, which have to do with type as a technical product intended for specific purpose. These criteria are independent of other qualities, including that of beauty, which is indeed in the eye of the beholder, and none of these qualities have anything to do with taste, which might even favour the ugly as well as the technically inferior.</p>

<p>BTW, in 1905, a fellow by the name of Max Weber published a paper on why Protestants generally made more money than Catholics. Part of his answer was that Catholics were stuck in the concept that they were simply craftspersons and artisans.

<p>In most cases they can&rsquo;t, but they can have a gut reaction and personal opinion. Just as I have gut reactions when looking at buildings even though I don&rsquo;t know much about architecture.</p>
<p>Designers often try to anticipate the reaction of average, non-designer folks to their designs, since that will be the eventual audience for most designed pieces.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the more primal question: what is the purpose/utility/intention of communication, and from that, what are the various tools required to most effectively communicate (including fonts)?</p>
<p>This is a slightly weirder question than it first appears. Most humans have never been trained to communicate authentically. There is a Greek word Parrhesia which essentially means to speak everything. Most people, however, have been trained to speak not everything but a filtered version of their discerned knowledge; most people speak in an attempt to convince someone of something&hellip; rhetoric. Parrhesia, however, is not rhetorical&hellip; it is &ldquo;full&rdquo;, organic, unvarnished, innocent of any other purpose but to communicate what is within a person&rsquo;s fullest state of being.</p>
<p>In short, most humans communicate dishonestly. Why, then, should a craftsperson spend the time and labor and love to design a font that is technically better for people that just communicate dishonestly?</p>
<p>Or, to put another way&hellip; let us assume that the most &ldquo;technically effective&rdquo; font is one where the top 25% of the font visually transmits the pertinent information of the letter. Unfortunately, though, the most profound and most widely read book on planet Earth is set in some other typeface. The lack of a technically perfect font did not prevent the whole world to read this book. Perhaps, a less technically perfect font makes people work harder or slower in digesting the words of the book. What is the perfect reading speed of text? Can a font designer actually design a font that controls reading speed? That is a genuine question.</p>
<p>But, you should get the point I attempting to make about the priorities of type design.</p>
<p>BTW, my wife pities you guys.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael, I think you are misreading the comments with which you are disagreeing (which doesn&rsquo;t excuse the insults you are flinging willy-nilly, but I&rsquo;m just going to ignore those).  With regard to quality &ndash; that which you hold to be in the eye of the beholder &ndash; maybe it would help if you were to define what you mean? I hope it is plain from what I wrote that quality is something that I believe needs to be judged against criteria proper to the thing considered. There is, for example, no point in trying to judge the quality of a typeface against the criteria of quality in musical compositions or downhill skiing. So if you really want to insist that quality is in the eye of the beholder, then one needs to consider what sort of person that beholder is, and what he or she knows about the criteria of quality in a given thing. This is absolutely not to say that the person who isn&rsquo;t an expert in typography is stupid, an idiot when it comes to things typographic. There are often common or parallel criteria for quality that enables one to build up what I consider a general feel for a good thing even if one&rsquo;s particular knowledge of a given thing is limited. But it is a fool indeed who thinks that this general feel substitutes for or is equivalent to particular, expert knowledge. There are many things about which I can form an opinion of taste, or which I can admire in various ways, while at the same time acknowledging that I know very little about the criteria of quality by which a more knowledgeable person would judge them; hence, I don&rsquo;t rate my opinion above its limited range.</div>

<p>How can the average salescritter or truck
driver tell the quality of a design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most cases they can&rsquo;t, but they can have a gut reaction and personal opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but exactly how should one interpret this? To my understanding, the writer is saying that a salesperson or truck driver is INCAPABLE of discerning quality in any kind of tangible sense. That gut reaction and personal opinion is all they are capable of achieving? What a sad condemnation of the human race that &ldquo;common&rdquo; folk cannot discern quality, or beauty, or sublimity, or anything other than their primal and primordial instincts&hellip;</p>
<p>Hrant&hellip; not vicious&hellip; just drilling down on how people in general (and people here on this forum) are guided more by their egos than their fuller imagination and potential.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the foundational point: no one on this forum can truly answer the question of what makes a quality typeface. As I alluded to in the previous post, quality might need to include the concept of reading speed. What is the most effective reading speed, and what font in the market today meets that requirement?</p>
<p>Consequently, if the type designers (the so-called professionals) themselves cannot determine what is quality, then why in the hell is anyone saying that salespeople or truck drivers are not professionals and thus cannot really discern what quality is. NO ONE CAN AUTHENTICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY SAY WHAT QUALITY IS OR IS NOT. Until such time, quality is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Who is capable of designing a new typeface for Canberra? Anyone (professional or otherwise).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, this is really not a matter of arrogance on the part of designers. I&rsquo;ll try to explain it.</p>
<p>The key point is that people are not necessarily reliable authorities on their own reactions. When people consciously reflect on their preferences and report their opinions, they can report an opinion that is actually in conflict with own their automatic or unconsciously produced reaction. Researchers in psychology have documented how people are not reliable authorities on their own actual reactions, and therefore regard introspective reports as something not to be taken at face value.</p>
<p>What an experienced designer in any field can do is to become conscious of what actually moves people, and what doesn&rsquo;t, and learn how to produce a desired effect. In particular, a very common misjudgment by the inexperienced is to only look at their immediate impression of one element, and neglect both the broader context of the design element, and how it is going to last over time.</p>
<p>For example, Mark Simonson has pointed out that amateurs tend to opt for highly &ldquo;flavored&rdquo; fonts like Comic Sans and Papyrus, even when they may prove inappropriate in context or cloying over time to the very people who are choosing them.</p>
<p>And graphic designer Paula Sher has reported that her clients regularly have told to her to &ldquo;make it bigger&rdquo;, when the result of doing that will make for a worse design. It is not that the design couldn&rsquo;t be improved, but that the amateur simply misunderstands what will actually help.</p>

<p>I am only engaging with you because the answers might be interesting to others, not because I have any expectation that your bizarre beliefs based on zero evidence can be changed.</p>
<p>Example: in the Crafting Type Portland workshop a few weeks ago, I specifically showed the students eight common issues of optical compensation that amateurs often miss when attempting their first type designs (it took 53 slides, mostly visuals). I can certainly say that doing such things right is one of the hallmarks of a decent quality typeface, and that a typeface that fails on any of the earlier points in particular is of poor quality.</p>
<p>Note: these principles apply to Latin type design. Other writing systems often change one or more of these principles (although some are pretty much universal).</p>
<p>The short list of optical compensations I presented on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Curves need to overshoot flats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straights need a gradual transition to become curves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where rounds run into straights, some thinning or compensation is needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizontal strokes need to be thinner than vertical strokes to appear the same thickness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rounds need to be a little thicker than straights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional thick/thin patterns create expectations that affect perceptions, even of nominally monoline letterforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caps are generally best made slightly heavier (e.g. 4–10%) than lowercase letters in the same typeface, but not lighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optical vertical midpoint of a letter is higher than the geometric midpoint (e.g. crossbar on an H, or thinnest point of a slightly flaring letter, by about 2–3%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round shapes are seen as more round when they are very slightly super-elliptical</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s nine points. Somehow I managed to stick 8 and 9 together, which was an error in my slides.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, have you thought about putting together your own book on the subject? That is a kick starter campaign I would very happily get behind. Which in turn makes me realise that it could also be the ultimate piece of Typophile merchandise, an ebook version perhaps including links to key threads.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, William but I meant something to cover the complete range of skills and knowledge that Thomas regularly shares on the site, along with those of many other contributors, yourself included. Typophile has long been an invaluable resource of information, frequently going into far greater detail than anything easily accessible in book form, and it would be amazing to see some of that collected in a single reference volume.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn’t be so certain, myself!</p>
<p>In any case, I actually gave a great deal of thought to editing such a book a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Then my other plans and gigs went nuts, and I sidelined the idea for the time being. I need to finish my Kickstarter typeface, and not have any other major projects in the way (other than my day job). Then <em>maybe</em> I will get back to that. Or not.</p>
