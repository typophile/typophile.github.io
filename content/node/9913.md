body: "so i've read that the design of the [[florin]] symbol is based on the italic
  f. can anyone point me toward or give me any other tips on what makes a good florin?
  also... with the EU and all, is this character even relevant today???\r\n\r\nhmmm...
  just found it on a site for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,,617513,00.html\">defunct
  european currencies</a>.\r\nIs there any reason it should still be included in a
  font?"

  body: '<i>Is there any reason it should still be included in a font?</i> <BR> <BR>Two
    good reasons: <BR> <BR>1. It is a character in many standard 8-bit codepages,
    so if you are making a font that claims support for e.g. the Mac Roman or Windows
    1252 codepages you had better include it. <BR> <BR>2. Some users, particularly
    on the Mac, have begun using the florin symbol as an abbreviation for &#39;folder&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>Note that the Unicode codepoint for the florin unifies this currency
    symbol with a hooked f, which is a letter in the alphabet of many African languages.
    This can cause design issues in fonts for African languages, since the hooked
    f is not always sloped in the way the florin usually is, but is harmonised to
    the style of the other letters in the typeface.'

  body: It&#39;s a standard character, so it&#39;s gotta be there, no matter how people
    use it or not. <BR> <BR>The only non-intuitive but crucial thing about the Florin
    seems to be that it should really be slanted; an upright one is sort of a stand-alone
    unorthodox design statement; not suitable for a text font. <BR> <BR>BTW, the Florin-as-folder
    usage is quite old, at least 10 years or something. <BR> <BR>&#62; the Unicode
    codepoint for the florin unifies this currency symbol with a hooked f <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    kind of dumb. <BR>Will it be fixed? <BR> <BR>hhp
