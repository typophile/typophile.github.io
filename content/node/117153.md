  body: Perhaps I should mix typefaces, but I thought that it would be great if I
    could get away with Goudy Oldstyle and Italic exclusively. They seem to have just
    about every anatomical feature going for them. Good call on the solidus. I'll
    add a fraction.

  body: 'In searching for information about the bullet point, I learned something
    new: that the paragraph mark is called the ''pilcrow''. Also, a fleuron used as
    a paragraph divider is sometimes called a ''hedera'' (at least when it is in the
    form of an ivy leaf, the meaning of that word).'

    thing about a good pilcrow goes unmentioned in that HTF article: that it must
