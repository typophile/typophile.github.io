  just bought a new G5 with OS 10.4.1 on it. Am working on getting everything up and
  running.\r\n\r\nI discovered Font Book (which I know is not the best tool for sorting
  fonts, but for now it's what I have) and was browsing through the fonts that came
  installed. Discovered that what is on the list is not necessarily available to me
  in my software. The most glaring example is the \"Apple Symbols\" font. I see it
  in the Font Book, I see it in the Library/Fonts folder, but when I try to use it
  in ANY application (Adobe...Microsoft...or native apps) it is simply not there as
  an option!! \r\n\r\nOther fonts with this same problem are: Arial hebrew, Baghdad
  (the other ones I've found are all different languages - if that is relevant...however,
  some of the other language fonts do appear as choices, they just don't \"work\"
  in the applications, which I assume is because I don't have \"international\" turned
  on in the system preferences). \r\n\r\nThanks in advance..."

  body: "Thanks both of you for your replies. \r\n\r\nParker -I am the only user of
    the computer, and so I don't think it matters whether it's in the user folder
    or the computer library folder; however, I did check and the fonts in question
    are in the computer library folder. The article was interesting because I have
    turned off some of those other language fonts - I didn't know I was installing
    them and anyway I can't use them - and even though it says in the article I'd
    be unable to disable some of the necessary ones, I seem to be able to. Hm. Hope
    I'm not messing something up. \r\n\r\nBlairyo - thanks, that did work for Text
    Edit but I still have no ability to use those fonts in my Adobe software.\r\n\r\nI
    went to the Applestore to ask them about it, and totally stumped them too! We
    looked at their computers and those fonts were either not available (in certain
    software) or available as options but when you selected them and tried to type,
    nothing typed out. Very mysterious. Are you both able to use those particular
    fonts in a variety of applications? "

  body: "Hi Shortcake,\r\nIt seems that a program that supports the OSX text engine
    (and/or Unicode) is required to access the glyphs in Apple Symbols. The font has
    some strange behavior. For example,\r\n\r\nType a word in an OSX app such as Text
    Edit, Pages, Intaglio or EazyDraw. \r\nInsert an Apple Symbol character in the
    middle of the word. \r\nSelect All and change the font. The letters change shape,
    but the Apple Symbol is untouched! Why isn't it replaced by an oblong box? Intriguing\u2026\r\n\r\nAs
    you said, the font is not available in every application and it's sometimes listed
    at the top of the fonts menu, not at the bottom, as in Text Edit and Pages, etc.
    \r\n\r\nThe closest I can get to your experience is Expression 3.3. Expression
    runs in OSX (it doesn't need Classic to start), but the Font Panel and Special
    Characters panel are inaccessible. When you type the alphabet and numerals and
    choose Apple Symbols, you get oblong boxes. \r\n\r\nAdobe software runs on top
    of OSX, but their programs use their own built-in text engine. You may be able
    to access Apple Symbols via InDesign's character pallette.\r\n\r\nIn the 10.4
    Finder, Apple Symbols is described as a Windows TrueType font with a .TTF suffix.
    There are no Typographic features, which suggests that it's a 'plain' TTF\u2014not
    a Microsoft OpenType font. When the font is opened in Fontographer, the standard
    character slots (0-255, Mac encoding) are empty, which probably explains Expression's
    oblong boxes. \r\n\r\nThis can of worms has the smell of Unicode about it. The
    PDF below describes Apple Symbols as a 'generic font that makes available many
    of the symbolic/non-linguistic characters from the UNICODE character set'. The
    PDF is not designed for Mac OS users, but it could be helpful.\r\n\r\nhomepage.mac.com/atl/tex/AppleSymbols.pdf\r\n\r\nEvery
    one of the 1167 glyphs in Apple Symbols have Unicodes, so if you know the Unicode
    input method, you may be able to access the glyphs by typing the Unicode values.\r\n\r\nWhat
    a mess!\r\n\r\nIan"

  body: 'The fonts being discussed here don''t have any glyphs within the range of
    Latin characters. So when you "access" them, what that would mean in some cases
    is inputing text with one of the non-English input methods. A keystroke is mapped
    to a different Unicode area to display a particular glyph. (forgive me if my terminology
    is not perfect here, I''m not a professional type designer) In the case of Arabic
    and Hebrew support, there are also considerations for the fact that text is right
    to left.  I''m not sure if this is obvious or not. I opened Symbol.dfont in FontLab
    and could see that while there are glyphs for numbers, there are none for letters.
    It''s possible that Mac OS somehow detects that an active font isn''t applicable
    to a given input method and hides it. (wild speculation here) It may have been
    previously discussed on this site that there is another Mystery Font in /System/Library/Fonts
    called LastResort.dfont. It contains dummy glyphs, black boxes with unicode range
    indicators, to fill space when a particular Unicode glyph is unavailable in the
    system. As far as I know, it doesn''t appear in any font menu, ever. Of course
    the Character Pallette provides a nice interface to interact with some otherwise
    inaccessible type. '

  body: You can access the "Apple symbols" font in Adobe Illustrator CS from the TYPE
    menu. Select the insertion point in your text, then select the TYPE menu (top
    of the screen) and select GLYPHS, scroll to the character you want and double
    click and the charactor will be inserted into your text. Hope this helps!

  body: "Okay, since nobody has given the correct answer here, I'll chip in. There
    are about a dozen different ways a piece of software can iterate through fonts
    installed on your computer. Most modern apps, including virtually all Cocoa software,
    any Carbon software that exclusively uses ATSUI, and most apps that use the Carbon
    Font Manager call the OS to give them a list of \"available fonts\". That list
    is composed exclusively of Unicode-compatible fonts, that is either fonts that
    declare Unicode codepages, or that declare a known encoding which OS X can convert
    to Unicode. Baghdad unfortunately, whilst it has its cmap table vectored correctly
    with Unicode codepoints, fails to declare any supported Unicode ranges, Windows
    codepages, its sequencing character set (if any), nor is it encapsulated within
    a suitcase with an appropriate FOND script ID associated. Mac OS X therefore turns
    a blind eye to it and deems it unsuitable for Unicode (since it cannot presume
    the glyphs at cmap IDs 600 to 6FF are really Arabic). Arial Hebrew is the same
    (though vectored from 590 to 5FF).\r\nThese fonts are included because they can
    and are used by software that is not Unicode aware, and ignores the fonts cmap,
    simply treating them as a MacArabic, CP1255 or whatever font. You will usually
    find, especially for the CE and CY versions of fonts, that their parent font now
    included the characters in the correct unicode positions (e.g. Courier CY has
    been superseded by adding Cyrillic glyphs to Courier).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Apple
    Symbols is to provide a fallback font for glyphs which are not available in any
    other font (not counting LastResort). If you have a character sequence such as
    \"0068 0069 0020 263A\" (hi \u263A) and you set the font, then if your new font
    doesn't have a glyph for U+263A, *and* the application has font substitution enabled
    (it's on by default for ATSUI/Cocoa apps), then the OS will search for a font
    which has a glyph for that character, and display that glyph instead of an empty
    box. If it cannot find a matching glyph, one from the LastResort font is matched
    and returned. This is why the character \u263A will always be displayed using
    Apple Symbols.\r\nAs to why it's not appearing in your apps, that stumps me, as
    it shows up in TextEdit here!\r\n\r\n\u2013 Nicholas"
