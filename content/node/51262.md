    licenses do not allow such operations. Also, much depends on from what you want
    to convert. Is it Type-1, TrueType or something else?\r\n\r\nI hope this was helpful.
    Good luck!"

  body: "Adam - By listing tools that can be used to convert to OTF, are you now saying
    that it's OK to convert fonts from Truetype or Type 1 to Open Type? Three months
    ago (to the day, in fact) in the Adobe OpenType Developers forum, you spelled
    out in some detail a number of things that don't necessarily convert transparently.
    The areas included kerning, linespacing values, and styles and fontnames, while
    noting that this was not a complete list. You ended with:\r\n\r\n\"In my experience,
    a fully automated successful conversion from Type 1 to OpenType is quite difficult
    and requires technical knowledge of the OpenType specification beyond an average
    user's skills.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a technical (rather than legal) standpoint, under
    what circumstances would you recommend or be tolerant of such conversions ...
    and when NOT?\r\n\r\n - HVB"

  body: "I'm not Adam, and have never even played him on TV, but let me take a shot.\r\n\r\nI've
    converted a number of Type 1 fonts to .otf. The way I look at it is that .otf
    are just Type 1 fonts with an OpenType wrapper. I don't know any \"conversion\"
    software that writes good enough features, so you have to understand how to write
    features. Usually, the foundry kerning is inadequate, so you have to re-write
    the kerning, but you had to do that with Type 1 fonts anyway.\r\n\r\nPotential
    naming and linespacing problems are ones I can't speak to, as we only use converted
    fonts with InDesign & it is quite forgiving about names & we don't use any built-into-the-font
    linespace values. But the question comes up: if you aren't going to use the \"features\"
    (advantages) of OpenType, why convert? The only answer I can think of is to get
    everything in Unicode; that the *file* is more important than the *document*.
    If you are using, say, Word, and the file isn't what's important, why convert?"

    saying that it\u2019s OK to convert fonts \r\n> from Truetype or Type 1 to Open
    Type?\r\n\r\nWell, if one has a PC Type 1 font that he or she has to use on Mac
    OS X or vice versa, then a simple conversion to OTF may be helpful. But such fonts
    will not stand any comparison to profesionally-mastered fonts. Unless you really
    know what you're doing, the self-made OpenType fonts may work fine in one app
    but not in another, may have different linespacing depending between different
    systems and applications, the kerning may not work, the automatic ligatures may
    not work, some styles from the family may be missing etc. \r\n\r\nBut if you really
    need to get done something badly for a one-off publication, it's still better
    than nothing. But I wouldn't build a regular publication schedule or a corporate
    identity around such a conversion. \r\n\r\nIt's like when you need to insert some
    company's logo into a poster quickly, you'll autotrace it from a bitmap or insert
    an RGB variant and rely on the prepress software to deal with the color conversion.
    It'll be done quickly but you risk that the result may actually be wrong. On the
    other hand, if you care about the quality, you'll find a high-quality vector version
    of the logo with the official PANOSE or CMYK color definitions and usage guidelines.
    \r\n\r\nA."
