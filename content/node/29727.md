  values from \"a\" to \"\xE1\"?"

  body: "Alternatively, use class kerning. In the Classes panel, specify a kerning
    class that has \"a\" as the key glyph and \"\xE1\" as the dependant glyph (with
    all the other accented \"a\"s there as well), and mark the class scope to cover
    both the left and the right side (using the checkmarks). The kerning for \"\xE1\"
    and the other accented \"a\"s will from now on be automatically linked to the
    kerning of \"a\". \r\n\r\nNote that for Type 1 and OpenType TT/TrueType fonts,
    you need to expand your kerning before generating the final font while OpenType
    PS fonts use class kerning directly and there is no need to expand it. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam
