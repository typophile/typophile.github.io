body: "Hi!\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a final year dissertation on the subject
  of type design and the legal framework/ins and outs of utilising typefaces and fonts,
  and was looking to get some broad insights from people in the Typophile community.\r\n\r\nThe
  question is as follows:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Given the current commercial and legal
  environment for typography, what scope is there to simplify licensing to facilitate
  the broader use of type?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is particularly with regard to
  having to stipulate all the font usages in advance when there are many unforeseen
  elements within the design process, and also a simplification for use by non-designers
  might help access a new market (purchasing as a commodity - essentially license
  free with the aim of reducing piracy?)\r\n\r\nI'm also looking into whether a global
  agreement about copyright and protection of the designs is feasible - at least to
  get closer to an international accord as both European and US regulation varies.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all your help in advance!\r\n\r\nHugo"

  body: "Hi HARaymond. Welcome to Typophile. Regarding your research, when using Typophile
    please be sure to cite it properly:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an in-text citation every
    time you cite someone or something, regardless of how many instances there are.\r\n\r\n2.
    In your references, regardless of how many times you have cited the same person,
    you only need a reference for each group of citations by year. Provide another
    reference should you cite the same person from a different year \u2014 which is
    not uncommon for long threads. Below is an example of four in-text citations which
    span a two year period, which only require two references:\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n<strong>In-text
    citations</strong>\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the first quote or passage.\u201D (Dean,
    2008, September 7, Page 8, 17:33).\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the second quote or passage.\u201D

    also recommend using youe real name as your screen name.\_Let\u2019s say you were
    citing Chris Lozos. You make the appropriate in-text citation (Lozos, C. 2000)
    and reference, but, when the reviewer goes to check the URL, all they will see
    is a screen name \u2014 dezcom, and they may be unable to validate your source.
    If a reviewer can\u2019t validate your source they may not let it be published,
    and you would have to remove content, citation, and reference entirely. In addition
    to this, you will find you get greater feedback if you use your real name.\r\n\r\nYou
    will also find that you get greater feedback if you show what you have already
    come across in your own research up to this point, as it will help narrow things
    down for those whose assistance you are seeking.\r\n\r\nI would encourage using
    input from an online forum as a starting point to assist you in finding a primary
    source. Traditionally, in academia, references to anecdotal information (things
    unpublished) tend to carry less weight then published references.\r\n\r\nBe mindful
    that\_a failure to properly cite and reference any source, even an online forum,
    is\_plagiarism.\r\n\r\n(Where do you study, and are you in an undergraduate, graduate,
    or PhD program?)"

    body: "Hi Chris,\r\n\r\nThanks very much for the information regarding the citation.\r\nI
      was originally wanting to highlight the question which was why I used the cite
      HTML tag as you can't use the bold tag. I'll also include my full name in my
      profile so as to give greater credibility too. I was hesitant to include any
      further research I'd done so as not to influence the responses and get the broadest
      insight possible, which I could then debate further once people had replied
      to the thread. Also, I've tended to realise that long introductions to projects
      in a quest for answers on forums, often puts people off responding!\r\n\r\nIn
      response to your question I'm currently preparing the 6,000 word dissertation
      for my final year of my BA in Graphic Design at Ravensbourne College of Design
      and Communication in London, UK. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nHugo"

  body: "My \u201Creal name recommendation\u201D is for screen names, not just profile
    names, so when someone cites someone (or tries to cite you) they can be found.
    For example, if I were to reference you from this post, it would read:\r\n\r\nRaymond,
    H. (2013). Re: Licensing and the future of type design [Online forum comment].
    Retrieved from http://typophile.com/node/105777.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a peer reviewer
    goes to check the reference prior to publication, they will follow that link,
    and only see HARaymond. If there are hundreds of comments, a reviewer will certainly
    not click everyone\u2019s handle to check their profiles in search of their real
    name. If a reference can\u2019t be validated, the authour will be asked to remove
    it and edit their content appropriately. A good practice to adopt and one that
    I would recommend to elicit greater feedback as well.\r\n\r\nThe bold tag (without
    the spaces so it can be read) = < s t r o n g > w o r d < / s t r o n g > = <strong>word</strong>.\r\n\r\nAdditional
    tags can be seen below the Comment box."

  body: "Hugo, competitive forces work against uniformity in licensing, so I suspect
    you will find your answer is 'no'. People are aiming at different market segments,
    and trying different business models, and this diversity is reflected in different
    license agreements. Currently, for example, people a doing different things in
    the area of web fonts. \r\n\r\nIn technical standards, there is a strong force
    for unity to make fonts work on all browsers and machines. But in licensing there
    is no competitive advantage gained by uniformity, so I don't see why that should
    happen, unless it turns that a single model is the most profitable. Given that
    there are different aspects of the market, I doubt that.\r\n\r\nThe folks to talk
    with are the heads of foundries, including both independents and group shops,
    and the few lawyers (like Frank Martinez), who are really knowledgeable in this
    area.      "

  body: "Licensing does not effect how broadly type is used. Hardware manufacturers
    provide freely licensed fonts with their new devices. \r\n\r\nCertainly, texting
    has become more popular than speaking, on cell phones, but font licensing was
    not a factor in this.\r\n\r\nWhen Apple pioneered DTP, the company established
    credibility by licensing fonts such as Times and Helvetica, and distributing them
    bundled with the Laserwriter. That did indeed encourage the broader use of type."

    the screen name and real name in the reference? Something like \"John Smith, posting
    as JSmith35\".\r\n\r\nThe American Psychological Association style guide says:
    \"In blog posts, authors may adopt a screen name. Use that screen name as the
    author if that is the name under which that person posts messages.\" And the MLA
    style guide says: \"It is acceptable to include screen names as author names;
    however, if both an author name and screen name are available, place the author\u2019s
    name in brackets.\""

    body: "You\u2019re correct, using both names <em>is</em> acceptable, but it looks
      a little clunky, and makes things more difficult for the reviewer. I have heard
      academics complain of this first hand. I\u2019ll make the same point again,
      seeing a real name as a screen name adds credibility to posts and the community,
      and has been my experience that they elicit greater and more serious feedback.
