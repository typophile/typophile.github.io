    made from the R or the other way round. The W doesn\u2019t fit into the face at
    all.\r\ncustomized something?"

    don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. The S differs. P differs and is open in Bodebeck."

  body: "You're probably right, but it does seem to have a superficial resemblance.
    As for 'who would do something like that?' Haven't we seen designers do a wide
    variety of strange things? (actually it seems more likely to me that Bodebeck
    started out as something with serifs that were clipped off later).\r\n\r\nIt was
    just a thought, not a serious ID attempt. As we've often noted, sometimes people
    posting here are trying to re-create a look, either by finding the actual font,
    or by finding something close enough that it can be made to resemble the sample
    (if it doesn't have to stand close inspection by font fanatics).\r\n\r\n- Mike
