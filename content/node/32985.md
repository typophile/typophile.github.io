body: "I've recently received a kind email from Erwin Denissen at High-Logic filling
  me in on a few details of the latest release of MainType. I think he contacted me
  because I've been rather vocal on the topic of font managment for Windows (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27616\">27616</a>,
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30644\">30644</a>, etc.), and have, for the
  most part, been holding up Proxima's FontExpert as the best of the bunch (IMHO).\r\n\r\nAfter
  Erwin's email and a few messages back and forth, I have to say MainType is quite
  impressive. The interface, easily customizable, is similar to FontExpert and includes
  the panels you'd expect. The preview-text panel is nice in that you can simply type
  right in it: no saving text files or jumping to Options windows to create sample
  strings [although the preview doesn't pop in OT featured switches]. There's also
  a handy zoom panel, where clicking on a glyph in the Character pane displays an
  enlarged sample of that glyph in its own pane.\r\n\r\nThe Character map panel itself
  lists each Unicode grouping that is mapped in the font, providing access to what
  you're looking for in a nicely organized fashion. Aside from a small bug that Erwin
  has now fixed, the only thing missing is an option in the Character panel to view
  glyphs which are missing Unicode points (for example, Fedra Serif B Pro doesn't
  have it's small caps mapped, which means you can't see them in MainType at the moment);
  this is, of course, a weakness in such a font itself, but Erwin has mentioned he'll
  look into making these glyphs visible too.\r\n\r\nAuto-activation for InDesign/Quark
  is absent, but after raising a stink about this a while ago I've come to realize
  I don't really need it anyway. Handy, sure, but the implementation of the plug-in
  in FontExpert was clumsy (slow) and I ended up turning it off. Besides, I'm a freelancer,
  so if I can't keep track of my own projects I should probably take a holiday, not
  bitch about the fact that my software is lazy.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that
  my main irritation with FontExpert was a real lag in start-up, and the fact that
  the app didn't sit in the system tray made this worse because every start was a
  fresh (slow) start. MainType is much quicker on the draw, and you can either keep
  it active in the tray or shut it down to free up some processing juice.\r\n\r\nFor
  what it's worth, I'd strongly suggest those still hunting for the right manager
  for Windows to take a look: <a href=\"http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html\">http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html</a>"

    Jason, actually Fedra follows Adobe's glyph naming recommendations. No weakness
    in the font. Small caps are alternate glyph forms which should not have their
    own Unicode points; those that Adobe assigned in earlier OTFs are 'private use'.\r\nThe
    way in which layout or font management software addresses these glyphs (via OT
    feature or via glyph palette) is a different story."

  body: "Karsten, you know more about this sort of thing than I do, but by weakness
    I simply meant in relation to MainType; that is, Fedra Serif B Pro does not have
    Unicode points assigned to its small caps (or many of its ornaments, superior/inferiors,
    ligs, alternates, etc.), and thus such glyphs don't show up in a Unicode-only
    display such as the one built into MainType. Fedra is a wonderful font and I've
    corresponded with Peter as he was building the OT Pro version, but in this particular
    situation MainType isn't displaying all of the glyphs because many of them don't
    have Unicode tags. Thus, you're right, the issue here is simply to do with how
    font management applications pick and choose what to preview, not with any weakness
    in the font <em>as a font</em>.\r\n\r\nCarl, I've seen it, heard the horror stories,
    and am boycotting the thing after far too long a wait. Linotype dropped the ball
    on this, in my opinion, so free or not I'd rather support those who seem to care
    about Windows users.\r\n"

  body: 'Well, sure, I was exagerating: there have simply been a few posts about frustrating
    issues, but the beta-warnings from Linotype alone are a bit of a joke. I realize
    they probably wanted to get <em>something</em> out there, but (and, again, this
    is just my cranky opinion) it''s simply too little too late. I am, of course,
    making an issue out of nothing: the software is free afterall, but the principle
    of the thing gets under my skin.'

  body: "Well, I've been experimenting with MainType, and I like it quite a bit. The
    interface is similar to FontExpert's, but it's less cluttered and more intuitive.
    A few features that are not working or missing:\r\n\r\n1. In the font properties
    pane, the kerning pairs line does not seem to work, at least for OTF's of a postscript
    persuasion. For Cambria, I get 14,000 kerning pairs. For Adobe Jenson I get none.\r\n\r\n2.
    I wish the sample window had a button that would apply kerning (much like FontExpert
    does).\r\n\r\n3. The scroll wheel on my mouse doesn't work inside the various
    panes.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it's terrific. I'm certainly going to dump Suitcase
    now."

  body: "High-Logic's MainType is really nice. I have trialled all the other Windows
    options and MainType is by far the best. It's fast and easy to use, but very powerful.\r\nThe
    main thing I like about it is that it doesn't try to 'organise' your fonts for
    you. If your fonts are already organised how you like, it will work with this.\r\nYou
    can browse your active fonts or fonts in folders elsewhere on your computer. You
    get to see a sample preview which you can easily type over or revert to a number
    of presets, plus a full character map. You also get a choice between activating
    and permanently installing fonts.\r\nHope this helps.\r\nbtw I don't work for
    them, just seems that people have a lot of trouble finding decent, stable font
    managers for Windows!"
