  body: "Bracketed and unbracketed serifs refer to the shape of the serif.\r\nAn unbracketed
    serif has the appearance of a straight line like those in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bodoni\">Bodoni</a>
    or Rockwell, a serif is bracketed when it has a curve leading into the serif.\r\nDisplay
    types covers a huge area but essentially those are the types that you would use
    for headlines but not for text the best way to see the types of fonts that make
    up this group is to type display in the search facility of something like MyFonts.com\r\nNormal
    joining stroke needs a context to give a definition\r\nTim"
