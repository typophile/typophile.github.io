    proper nouns, like Aetius, where \"ae\" represents two separate sounds rather
    than a diphthong. In Roman inscriptions, though, whether it is a diphthong has
    nothing to do with whether it is ligatured. Any pair (or occasionally more) of
    letters in any word can be ligatured, if it makes sense graphically. It's purely
    a design/layout decision.\r\n\r\n(ETA - I should check for new posts before hitting

    or \"r\xFCckw\xE4rts liegend\" in German, I don't know the English term, if there
    is one). My choices are definitely \xC6 no. 1 and \u0152 no. 3, but for a sans
    serif I might chose \u0152 no. 1. \u0152 no. 4 is pleasing to the eye, but I feel
    it's not ligated enough. \u0152 no. 5 looks very Mannerist or Baroque, and might
    work in such a typeface.  \r\n\r\nJust as I think the E is the important part
    of the \xC6 ligature, I think the O bit is most important for the \u0152. I'm
    of course heavily culturally biased. The \u0152 is not used in modern Norwegian,
    but it's traditionally used for normalised transcription of the long \xD8-sound
    in Old Norse. (These days, it's sadly being replaced by the (mostly) inaccessible

    the trouble of using the actual ligature rather than Oe, they would use the form
    \u0152.\r\n\r\nIt is such a rare occurrence for \u0152 to come at the beginning

    to say the Oe ligature reads very naturally. I think French readers may think

    in that way. This would not be the case with, say, Norwegians and \xE6.\r\n\r\nHere's
