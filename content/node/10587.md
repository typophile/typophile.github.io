  body: I suppose I&#39;d figure it out if I saw the company&#39;s title along side
    it, but I wouldn&#39;t have seen the d&#39;s with just this mark. Also, if left
    to my own devices to find letters here, I&#39;d probably see either dS or ddS.
    As a shape, it is interesting. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Scott

  body: Jesse, its a forced concept. If you are dealing with anyone other than designers
    they won&#39;t get it no matter what you do. Is the mark supposed to communicate
    something or is it just a design. As a design its nice, as communications it doesn&#39;t
    work.

    start over completely?

  body: Jesse, keep the mark but put the words it represents next to it. As the mark
    ages it will make it own idenity and can stand alone. <BR> <BR>One last fear it
    looks like a logo for a natural gas company.

  body: First off, thanks to everyone here for all your helpful comments. I&#39;ve
    been busy with another, project, so i haven&#39;t been able to put together any
    revisions. I&#39;ll post what I come up with next week. <BR> <BR>I see the similarity
    to the natural gas logo, but I like the flame aspect of it. I need to think about
    it for a bit...
