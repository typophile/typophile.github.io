body: So, I&#39;m beginning to think about teaching my modern political thought course
  in the fall, and about ways--O idealistic me--to persuade students to take the material
  seriously and spend some time struggling with it, instead of dipping into and out
  of it after their whim or curiosity or emotional reaction, as if it were so many
  piles of blog commentary. <BR> <BR>I hit upon the idea of spending some time discussing
  with students what the very act of writing, then publishing, material in the past
  was like. Most everyone today composes on the computer, in air-conditioned rooms,
  on more or less comfortable chairs, with plenty of artificial light. Typesetting
  and printing, for those manuscripts that find their way into print, is done by people
  working in similar circumstances, most often without the need--unless the method
  is deliberately chosen--for physical typesetting and the pressing of letters into
  paper. <BR> <BR>But--to pick the example of the first author the students will be
  reading next term--Thomas Hobbes would have had to write his manuscript out by hand,
  with pens that had to be dipped, on expensive paper, in rooms without the benefit
  of temperature controls, on wooden furniture, under bad light . . . you get the
  idea. Things obviously would be even more unlike today&#39;s writers&#39; lairs
  the farther back in history you go.  <BR> <BR>Under those circumstances, it seems
  like you would take writing--and books and printing--very seriously, because you
  invest so much in the act, certainly more than the Ann Coulters and Michael Moores
  of today do in what appears in print under their names.  <BR> <BR>So, the combination
  of something really important to say and conditions that require a lot of investment
  in saying it would mean we could assume that even in very long manuscripts everything
  on paper is there for a reason. Authors would spend a long time thinking and talking
  about what they had to say in advance, they would gather their evidence and craft
  their arguments carefully, and they would make every word tell. Printers, for their
  part, would not take on jobs lightly.  <BR> <BR>This in turn demands &#40;the punchline
  would go&#41; that we read what they wrote differently than we would read the Coulters
  and Moores of today. Differently, even, than we might read the Strausses, the Arendts,
  the Rawlses, the Nozicks, the Blooms, and the Habermases of today. Not because the
  older authors are &#34;better&#34; or &#34;got it right,&#34; and not because many
  later authors are not also worth struggling with, but because the acts and circumstances
  of writing and publishing in the past produced prose meant to be read in different
  ways. <BR> <BR>Setting my windmills and tilting aside, of course I have only my
  general sense of social and technological history upon which to draw to make this
  case. The above may be no better than a caricature of how things really were, and
  I don&#39;t want to do my students the disservice of blustering through some harebrained
  tale that reads like the five feet of snow our grandparents walked through every
  day to get to school &#40;even in summer, and uphill both ways!&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
  where I hoped Typophiliacs might help me out. Are there good books on the history
  of the physical act and circumstances of writing and publishing relevant to the
  story I want to tell that I could consult to extend and/or correct it? Anything
  to suggest I&#39;m on the right track or completely full of it? Thanks for whatever
  you can recommend.

    target="_blank">The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius and an invention
    that changed the world</a>. <BR> <BR>Like most Gutenberg scholarship, Man&#39;s
    book seems to to based heavily on speculation, as very little detail is known
    about the facts of Gutenberg&#39;s life. Man makes both speculations of his own,
    and summarizes the speculations of others he seems to agree with. A good attempt
    is made throughout the book at trying to get an angle on Gutenberg&#39;s business
    operations; how much money he had, where he got it, depts, court cases and other
    civil &amp; legal records, etc. One can easily imagine how things could have gone
    the other way for Gutenberg, changing the course of history &#40;at least a little
    bit'

  body: Maurice, another note to make to your students about Thomas Hobbes is that
    most of the early editions of <i>Leviathan</i> were published outside of Britain,
    because the book was banned in Britain within a few years of its publication.
    Because it was difficult for Hobbes to control the publishing on the continent,
    a number of pirate editions also appeared &#40;for instance, the bookshop I used
    to work at had one in the Netherlands in the 1670s&#41;. So you have a good example
    here of the impact of political censorship on the life of a book.

    to resort to outside reference. Don&#39;t worry about the five feet of snow. Couldn&#39;t
    have been more than two feet. <BR> <BR>That Man book on Gutenberg is horrid. There
    is no &#34;easy way&#34; to Gutenberg &#40;if that is even the fellow we should
    be pursuing&#41; and I doubt any easy reference for your students. Take em on
    a field trip to a printing museum. Seems to be one around every corner these days.

    <BR>&#62;This in turn demands &#40;the punchline would go&#41; that we read what
    they wrote differently. <BR> <BR>According to Manguel, the Greek philosophers
    would certainly have been read differently in their own time: they would have
    been read out loud, because silent reading was unkown. There&#39;s lots more of
    this kind of observation in the book.'

  body: I read somewhere recently that the idea of silent reading may not have surfaced
    until well into the medieval period, if not later. <BR> <BR>But the note on the
    Greek philosophers also brought to mind something else. There is a story that
    during the performance of a Greek play there was an earthquake and the roof collapsed
    killing and crushing beyond recognition most of the audience. One of the actors
    was able to identify the remains simply by the seating arrangement as he had memorized
    it during the play. The art of memorization was highly tuned as there was no other
    way to record ephemeral information. Too bad I can&#39;t remember where I read
    that.

  body: Wow--these are all great suggestions. Ivan Illich and Barry Sanders have also
    written about the development of different kinds of memory and self-regard with
    different kinds of communication &#40;speech/language, writing, printing&#41;,
    and the transition between reading aloud and reading to oneself, where the latter
    encourages the reader to develop an internal space of critical reflection. <BR>

  body: 'Two important aspects of the ability to physically reproduce text are: <BR>
    <BR>1. The Reformation was promoted by the ability to get printed Bibles to everyone.
    Protestantism promoted the rise of European individualism, and so printing was
    a key factor. <BR> <BR>2. As my late Uncle Ben Lieberman liked to point out, freedom
    of the press is first of all the freedom to own and use a press. Nowadays with
    desk top publishing it is hard to imagine this, but only twenty years ago this
    was an important factor in the fall of the Soviet Union. George Soros disseminated
    photocopy machines - a kind of press - in Eastern Europe, which may well have
    hastened the fall of the Communist empire.'

    to be written? <BR> <BR>I already tell students about the points William and John
    raise--they&#39;re good ones. Often I wonder if students think that everyone in
    the Middle Ages and after just went to Borders to buy the latest political tracts,
    and that anyone who finished writing a book on politics or religion could just
    send it off to publishers without fearing for their physical lives.  <BR> <BR>Maybe
    because the printed word &#40;despite high levels of book sales&#41; is less valued
    as such today in popular culture &#40;West and East, North and South alike, I
    fear&#41;, it simply doesn&#39;t occur to students that reading and writing used
    to be &#40;and in some parts of the world still are&#41; a life-or-death matter.'
