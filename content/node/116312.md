body: "Hey! I am doing this research project based on \"City Typography\"\r\n\r\nObjective:
  To study the vernacular feel of the city and then draw a comparison on the basis
  of the type having certain nuances that were characteristic of the city they are
  symbolic of.\r\n\r\nSo basically i am trying to show like how city's elements like
  Culture, Cusine, Lifestyle, Architecture, Language, Fashion and Traditions,  have
  some connection to its visual culture it showcases.\r\nSo for this i visited Cologne
  and Paris and collected visual reference for the same.\r\n\r\nBut before analyzing
  it further i would want to know more about the visual culture or type culture of
  these two cities. As in how it has changed? How it has evolved overtime? The visual
  history of these two places.\r\n\r\nSo anyone who can help out? Or give me links
  which could help? or any information on the same.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\nPLEASE HELP!\r\n"
