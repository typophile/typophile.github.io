  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">As has been noted in some recent threads, a kind type designer will assign Unicode points to all glyphs so that users can access them in non-Opentype-smart applications.

<A HREF="http://www.mufi.info/">MUFI</A> defines an unofficial standard for assigning codes in the Private Use Area to a lot of characters and ligatures needed for the precise transcription of Medieval texts. It's prominently linked from the Wikipedia entry on Unicode, and it includes many ligatures found in modern fonts, like fj and tz.

The fonts I'm working on are never going to be used for Medieval work, but since it otherwise doesn't matter where in the PUA my extra glyphs go, I feel I may as well put my tt ligature at U+EED9, which at least <em>someone</em> has already agreed corresponds to a tt ligature. I think it's even reasonable to find approximations; for instance, my swash P alternate can go in the place meant for "capital P with flourish". It's not really the same thing, but it's a P, and that's better than random. MUFI spans E000-F2FF, so glyphs without an applicable MUFI encoding should start at F300, because if half the special characters turn into the right thing when a text is changed to a MUFI font, the other half should become .notdef, not the wrong thing.

What are your opinions on using these codepages this way? Do you think it's a good idea, or a bad idea?</div>

Also see <a href="http://typophile.com/node/32164">this proposal</a> and google for even more related threads.

Indeed most applications have a serious problem with accessing unencoded glyphs. But this is the problem of these applications, not of fonts. It is not up to font developers to work around applications' shortcomings (mostly). And it has nothing to do with type designers being kind or not-so-kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)

PUA may allow MUFI for faster decisions and agreement among members, but PUA per definition excludes the idea of 'standard'.

The more interesting question is, how can type designers make sure that <em>OpenType-savvy</em> applications can 'map' all unencoded alternate glyphs back to encoded glyphs, so that no GIDs end up in the document? (Which would be as bad as PUAs since they are font dependent and non-standard too.)</div>

And if you want to rest all the responsibility on the software programmers, I think applications that use OpenType lookups should be able to preserve the plaintext whether the replacement glyph is encoded or unencoded. That seems more like something I'm willing to think of as "not my problem."</div>

So you say that it is wrong to blame low-cost applications since they do not cost much, but it is fine to blame fonts since they cost something?
In OT fonts, the relevant information is there: glyphs can be 'mapped' to Unicode codepoints directly via 'cmap', but also indirectly via OT layout tables. Of course it were helpful if applications would not ignore half of the information ...
Seems using low-cost apps has its price too. But having font developers pay for it, and be it with (more or less) hacks?

<cite>I think applications that use OpenType lookups should be able to preserve the plaintext whether the replacement glyph is encoded or unencoded.</cite>

If you enter plaintext in your application and apply OT features, then the application already knows the plaintext and may preserve it, and it shoudl not matter if glyphs are encoded or not. So this is neither an issue nor your original question. 
The issue is access to 'special glyphs', like inserting them via glyph palette. Then, the application has to find out, first of all, what a glyph's codepoint is. And here, PUA is just as bad as is mere glyph ID because PUA is non-standard. Change the font and see the effect.

However, if you make fonts for a special audience whom you may please with PUA, and if the result is a gif where character code does not matter anyway, why not.</div>

Quite a bold decision to presume what "the users" will or will not do. My experience says that "the users" will use every single opportunity the software will give them (of course, not every user will do the same). 

PUA is OK for many uses but I really seriously doubt that trying to semi-standardize it will make any sense.

		<div class="commentbody">To me it seems simple. If it should be standard, petition Unicode to put it in the Unicode Standard. Runes are in. Glagolitic is in. Klingon is out. Otherwise, PUA is just what it says: Private.

BTW, as I understand it, when you export an XML file with Private Use characters, you are apt to lose them. Better to address the problem at the source.  </div>
