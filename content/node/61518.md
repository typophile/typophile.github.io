    \r\nIndeed\r\nAuthenticJobs*\r\nKrop*\r\nLocal Professional Groups*\r\n\r\nThe
    * tend to lean a bit more interactive (which is what I do).\r\n\r\nI then tend
    to check a handful of larger .com/.org/.edu entities' employment sites where I'd
    like to work. Typically, the bigger the organization, the more antiquated/clumsy
    their online job postings site is, so you tend to have to manually check those
    routinely instead of being able to easily scrape/rss them."
