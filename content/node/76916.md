  is a display family in the tradition of Tuscan advertising and display faces.  It's
  a family of three 'all capital' faces.  A perpendicular regular form is offered,
  along with an italic form (a true italic - with purpose designed glyphs-NOT merely
  an oblique) and a basic form for small text - which dispenses with the family\u2019s
  characteristic outlined look.  It offers the spirit of the Victorian era with ready
  and distinctive legibility.  It's ideal for poster work, especially at large sizes,
  and for signage with a period flair.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Portello1_3568.png]\r\n\r\nPaget
  is a modern exploration of Tuscan design.  Here you'll find simple geometric outlines
  with an 'Arts and Craft' charm about them.  Paget is beautifully clear and easy
  to read, but offers a distinctive charm that conventional sans serif and serif faces
  don't.  Paget is offered in regular and oblique forms and is an ideal way to merge
  tradition and all that is new and fresh in your designs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Paget_6332.png]"
