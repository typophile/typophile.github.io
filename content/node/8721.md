  body: I don&#39;t have anything else. No more resolution and no more charcters.
    And it&#39;s not big enough to make a trace of the outlines and convert the font
    to vector! <BR> <BR>If you have some kind of idea of what font can be &#40;maybe
    you are about 3 or 4 options&#41; I can check them. The most similar I&#39;ve
    found is a bullpen italic... distorted. <BR> <BR>thank you!
