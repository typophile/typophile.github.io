  began to see very bizarre behavior in the OT features panel. It's hard to describe,
  but the OT panel seems to be inserting extra spaces into all the text in the OT
  panel, so that nothing compiles correctly, and clicking on any of the text or typing
  causes more extra space to appear to the left of the cursor. In other words it's
  impossible to format correctly, because any action I take just creates more bizarre
  spacing. I cannot edit, add, or compile OT features.\r\n\r\nI went and upgraded
  to the newest version of FontLab, 5.1.1, and the problem stays the same. Don't know
  if the problem is with FontLab or the computer itself, but the keyboard and trackpad
  seem to be behaving normally in all other applications. \r\n\r\nI used Screen Record
  to make a movie of the behavior, but it's much too big to post. Has anyone seen
  this behavior before or have any ideas?"

    to be the problem is not the real problem. Feature coding follows the same format
    as CSS coding. CSS code ignores irrelevant spaces, so I imagine feature coding
    would as well. Some other bad juju must be at work\u2026"

    space?\r\n\r\nWhen I first switched from FL4 to FL5, I found the OT panel to be
    completely unusable due to bad spacing/extra space issues which resulted in the
    cursor's apparent and actual positions not matching; I quickly discovered the
    reason for this -- they'd changed the default font for the OT panel to Courier
    New which I did not have installed and apparently it doesn't have an effective
    fallback mechanism.\r\n\r\nTry changing the font in preferences->general options->fonts->python
    and opentype editors.\r\n\r\nIf you're seeing the same problem which I remember,
    it's possible that your compilation problems are the result of some inadvertent
    editing (a carriage return in the wrong spot, perhaps) which occurred while the
    spacing was screwy.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
