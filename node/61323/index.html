<ul>
<li>Jason Santa Maria: [[http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/introducing-typedia/|Introducing Typedia]]</li>
<li>Yours truly: [[http://nicewebtype.com/notes/2009/08/24/why-typedia-matters/|Why Typedia matters]]</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you like Typedia as much as I do. As with any similar resource that&rsquo;s open to mass editing, there are bound to be opportunities for people to scoff and snarl at inaccuracies and naiveté. But if I know Typophiles the way I think I do, our positive, helpful camaraderie will only exponentially improve tangential projects and resources like this one.</p>
<p>How do <em>you</em> feel about this new resource? Do you have any questions or concerns?</p>

I see that unlike Wikipedia you run ads? Do you take referral income from the font distributors too?

<p>Best of luck with the venture.</p>

<p>You state, &ldquo;There is no corporate influence unless a particular distributor decides to flood the library with their own type,&rdquo; but isn&rsquo;t the site predicated on corporate involvement to provide content?</p>
<p>I have enough trouble supporting my distributors with new product and metadata, let alone servicing third parties.
For instance, MyFonts' graphic files (&ldquo;posters&rdquo;) are &ldquo;crowdsourced&rdquo; from its suppliers&ndash;I would be more inclined to work on those, than for Typedia.</p>
<p>The content will be provided by some foundries, and some fans, but there will be large gaps. 
IMO, naming it &ldquo;-pedia&rdquo; implies a scope that may not emerge.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t too much of a damper on an innovative idea, but I believe these are legitimate criticisms of your business model.</p>

<p>Well, you have to start somewhere :)</p>
<p>I hope that by putting the tools out there, it can only grow and get better. Sites like Typophile or Wikipedia got to where they are because of their members. I imagine their founders had the same intentions and hopes.</p>
<p>As for the content, you don&rsquo;t actually need to supply anything if you don&rsquo;t want to. We&rsquo;ve tried to set up the site to make it easy for people to add and expand information, and crediting back to the source when possible. So, just merely publishing your information anywhere is enough. The hope is that as the site grows, some one along the chain (whether designer, distributor, or type enthusiast) will care enough to add the typeface to Typedia.</p>

<p>That severely restricts &ldquo;some one along the chain&rdquo; from contributing visuals.
I suggest you revise the spec to accomodate GIF, PNG, and JPEG.
I mean, look how much trouble people have uploading image files to Typophile, even with that very basic file format requirement.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We heavily researched numerous possibilities for the best way to render out type samples, and begrudgingly, went with Flash. I&rsquo;m the last person who wants to use Flash for Typedia, but it&rsquo;s simply the best option for the sake of fidelity, even at the expense of some people not being able to contribute.</p>
<p>Other options (like images) suffer from a few big faults. 1) being locked into a specific size and character set. 2) different programs AND different operating systems introduce a myriad of different rendering options (most of which will introduce uncomfortable and inconsistent irregularities in character display). 3) the human factor. People will futz with size, color, and content of any templates we provide, which can harm any consistency Typedia might strive for. 4) content. We&rsquo;ve already adjusted the content of the type samples from our holder swf since launch, and plan to change it again soon. Originally it was ABC&hellip; abc&hellip;, we changed it to AaBbCc&hellip;, and now we&rsquo;ve been talking about displaying a word or pangram along with that to get a better sense of the way type looks. 5) flexibility. We use the same swf to generate the small samples seen in the site&rsquo;s sidebar, the medium samples seen on the listing pages, and the big detail samples that popup from the listing pages. It&rsquo;s considerably (though not entirely) future-proof, by comparison to images.</p>
<p>All of these things make image file alone a much weaker option.</p>
<p>I see this is a possible nice inroads to mixing type folks with type enthusiasts too. Type folks can help with listings and the people who buy fonts can help with samples. I know it&rsquo;s not ideal, but it&rsquo;s the best of what we have right now. I will jump at the chance to improve this in the future.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><strong>Conversations and expertise</strong></p>
<p>I have admired Typophile since I found out about it a few years ago, and not only because it&rsquo;s full of knowledgeable folks who love type and are happy to share what they know.</p>
<p>Typophile maintains <strong>the best forum that I have seen anywhere</strong>. Nick mentioned the challenge that uploading images presents; whether issues like this fall on experience design or are just a matter of user familiarity, they&rsquo;ll happen in every system. I haven&rsquo;t run into this problem at Typophile, but I have on other sites. Regardless, Typophile&rsquo;s forum is top-notch, and I won&rsquo;t stop [[http://nicewebtype.com/notes/2009/05/27/criticism-for-web-typography/|telling folks]] to visit, participate, and appreciate it. New readers: [[http://typophile.com/user/register|signup is free]].</p>
<p>Not only does Typophile sport the finest forum I&rsquo;ve found, but there&rsquo;s a wiki seamlessly integrated. Zara, thank you for the reminder about Typophile&rsquo;s [[http://www.typophile.com/wiki|Typo Wiki]]. It is an excellent resource, and I find myself there all the time without even realizing. Terms linked from forum posts lead me there.</p>
<p>The promise of tools that interoperate like this is nothing short of phenomenal; although wikis, in my experience, only occasionally deliver on their part of such a promise. Most of the time they&rsquo;re incomplete or inaccurate.</p>
<p>The Typo Wiki, by luck or by consistent care, is an exception; it usually provides me something of value, and often something I hadn&rsquo;t already known. Sometimes the superscript &ldquo;w&rdquo; links I follow lead to empty entries, but that&rsquo;s to be expected in every wiki. The information I do find in the Typo Wiki feels <strong>reliable, accurate, and thorough</strong>, and I have every reason to believe that it is those things because there is every indication of watchful guidance and wisdom from folks who know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>This is my experience of Typophile. Type experts, always eager to talk and offer thoughts or tips, as well as occasional, rich wiki references that support conversations in the forum. [[http://typedia.com/|Typedia]] is a new way in to this experience.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and ease of use</strong></p>
<p>Typedia is a wiki inasmuch as it affords community editing, but the reason it works so well is that it breaks away from wiki convention. It is very structured and easily navigable in ways that are often neglected by not only other wikis but other reference materials in general; these qualities, and the strength of the interface design that reveals them, makes Typedia feel <strong>forgiving, easy, and fun.</strong></p>
<p>Take for instance the [[http://typedia.com/good-deeds/|Good Deeds]] feature. If there are entries missing pieces, this feature encourages visitors to fill in the gaps. Consider what predicates such a feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having structure enough for the concept of gaps</li>
<li>Allowing for partial entries, and</li>
<li>Crafting copy that turns small chores into gold stars</li>
</ul>
<p>No other reference material anywhere enables this kind of behavior in small doses so concise and so effortless as found in Typedia.</p>
<p>Knowing that such a feature exists also makes contributing a lightweight task. If you want to help, all you need to know is the name of a typeface, type designer, or foundry. Leave the rest. Not only does this make for a fuller &lsquo;pedia, it makes for satisfied, engaged participants.</p>
<p>Of course, the capacity of a tool built by a handful of careful, thoughtful folks and a horde of folks with more enthusiasm than availability/knowledge is questionable. That&rsquo;s why Typedia needs <em>you</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Typedia for the basics, Typophile for the truth</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps this heading is misleading; Typedia won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;false,&rdquo; although misinformation is a constant concern, and Typophile offers plenty of basics if you know where to look. But Typedia&rsquo;s natural aptitude is for quick facts and nimble browsing, and Typophile&rsquo;s strongest faculty is its final word.</p>
<p>The presence of masterful thinkers and craftspeople at Typophile, despite the friendliest of exchanges I&rsquo;ve witnessed, is a barrier for some folks because it is overwhelming. Typedia removes this barrier at the cost of being, in the short term, empty and only somewhat relevant. But <strong>these things will change</strong> in time thanks to the coexistence of these two resources.</p>
<p>Typophile needs a note taker, and Typedia needs things to write down. These resources will prosper and be intertwined. Let&rsquo;s encourage folks to use both (cross-linking of various kinds is a great idea and has much potential), and play our participation to the strengths of each.</p>

<p>Actually they do include samples for fonts that they don&rsquo;t license. Before our fonts were available at retail we provided them so they could add them to the system for viewing purposes. Same goes for many MI fonts that they no longer license. If MyFonts were to add a wiki-feature, that might trump what Typedia is providing&hellip; or maybe not.</p>

<p>MyFonts is a font retailer. As long as they sell type there will be font makers who will choose not to supply them with fonts.</p>
<p>An independent resource that has no stake in selling type is good for everyone.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there is only a way to edit your &ldquo;Real Name&rdquo; from the edit profile page, which I have set to &ldquo;Jason Santa Maria&rdquo; already.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The hope is that at some point in the future we&rsquo;ll be able to reach out to foundries and maybe find something that can work for everyone. Perhaps there is even a way that we could tap into a rendering engine from a site externally and pull it into Typedia (I&rsquo;m only speaking technically, obviously this would coincide with a foundry/distributor offering such a service to us).</p>
<p>As Stephen said, we wanted to stay away from asking people to upload font files anywhere. It&rsquo;s a very slippery slope, which is why Cufon was also vetoed as a possible means to display samples.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m looking to explore for now is a possible way that we can generate a swf in a browser and bypass the need for someone to own Flash. Meaning, if the typeface is active in your system, you load up a page that allows you to select a typeface from the ones active on your machine, and generate a swf. This would make things very easy, no template to download, no files to upload. Just a few clicks and done.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how many projects start out.
But long-term viability is dependent on getting income to pay for people and services, once the period of goodwill is over, and volunteers burn out.
So &ldquo;right now&rdquo; is the operative phrase.
You may not have any longer term plans just yet, but you know very well that Typedia cannot survive in the long term without &ldquo;a stake in selling type&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. ads or sponsorship from foundries.
Typophile collects moneu for its Featured Face.
And Typographica sells nameplate ads.
So please, don&rsquo;t be so coy and cut the BS about &ldquo;independent resource with no stake in selling type&rdquo;!
What is wrong with a financial model that runs on type foundry money?
What other feasible way is there to finance a type site?
How about starting a foundation?</p>

<p>But the independence Stephen mentions is more about the integrity of Typedia&rsquo;s catalog than the actual money it collects. The point is, Typedia&rsquo;s catalogue isn&rsquo;t driven by any one distributor, foundry, designer, or individual. You can expect to see, presented impartially, information about and samples of any typeface, designer, or foundry, so long as someone has added these to the catalog.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s true :)</p>
<p>Typedia has no desire to sell type or be a font distributor. There are many community sites that run and maintain themselves with little or no funding. Typedia doesn&rsquo;t need to be a gigantic social community or anything, and I&rsquo;d actually prefer if it stayed fairly small and dedicated.</p>

<p>How are search results prioritized? Ranking is partial.</p>
<p>Giving &ldquo;classic examples&rdquo; of a genre is not impartial.</p>
<p>I must disagree that the catalogue is impartial.
For instance, Mercury Display is listed as in the &ldquo;Similar to&rdquo; of Century Schoolbook?!
The blurb about Mercury is copious &ldquo;first person&rdquo; advertising copy by H&amp;FJ, describing how it is derived from Fleischmann&rsquo;s work.
Props to H&amp;FJ for having such keen fans!</p>
<p>I suspect this site will be partial to popular faces, and to foundries that commit to uploading their faces, describing them in glowing terms, and leveraging &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; links and search ranking.</p>
<p>I was amused to see that Archer (&ldquo;Sweet but not saccharine, earnest but not grave, Archer is designed to hit just the right notes of forthrightness, credibility&hellip;&quot;)  is listed as a Scotch Modern (&ldquo;medium to high stroke contrast&rdquo;).
What is to stop this kind of commercialism on a site that purports to have &ldquo;no stake in selling type&rdquo;?
BTW, whether it originates from foundry (which I doubt in this case) or fans, the effect is still highly promotional.</p>
<p>Wiki has changed:

<p>This is the same information that you can collect by searching for a typeface in Google. We made it easy to post information about how a foundry describes one of their typefaces (and credit a source, namely the foundry site), but there is just as much of an opportunity for anyone to change that to something more impartial.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to talk to people that seem to be abusing the site, and if need be, remove their account.</p>
<p>Honestly, like any community site, of course there is the opportunity for negative interactions, but there is just as much incentive for positive ones. It all depends on how you approach the site. Typedia can be whatever you make of it. But if we only point out flaws in an open system, you&rsquo;ll certainly only see the negatives. :)</p>

<p>A foundry doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to post their library, unless perhaps they feel that it&rsquo;s being overlooked by Typedia&rsquo;s users. Ideally most of the entries would be contributed by users of typefaces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in adding older pre-digital typefaces that haven&rsquo;t been digitized (or may never be). The one problem I see with the way samples are done is that there is no way to add faces that are not available in digital outline format.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;d like to see people add is information (and samples if possible) about custom or proprietary faces. This is something one would not likely find on a site selling fonts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually easy for us to enable normal image uploads for these cases, we just need to figure out how the interaction happens first, and to still direct people to upload swfs for typefaces that are digital. It&rsquo;s definitely on the list of forthcoming improvements.</p>

What I like is that because of who is initially involved in the project, and the &ldquo;*pedia&rdquo; style contributory nature of the thing - names and faces from the world of web that wouldn&rsquo;t normally post here but think about and use and love type a great deal are being drawn to it and from there, they might very well be drawn here as well.
All of it being driven by @font-face and the idea of a web typography that isn&rsquo;t strangled down to a half dozen typefaces.
A renaissance of sorts in the making? I hope so.

<p>But I agree that eventually revenues will be needed. Free hosting only happens for sites with low traffic. Get successful, and you will need to pay for server time.
