  body: You don't really need a 3D program for something like this, Illustrator's
    pen tool should do the trick.

  body: "I think I'm looking for something more efficient than Illustrator's pen tool.
    Theoretically, almost anything could be made with Illustrator's pen tool. I agree
    on that. But the pen tool is not efficient for 3D. Like I said, I'm gonna do my
    outlines in Illustrator, but I want to find an alternative to Illustrator's own
    3D filter.\r\n\r\nThe other problem with the pen tool is that it's difficult to
    make edits once you have your paths finished. Specialized 3D allows you to make
    quick changes to perspective, depth, etc."

  body: "Check out Xara3d or, preferably, Cinema 4d. You can write text and give them
    3d extrusion directly within the software (complete with bevels, etc), or set
    up your text in Illustrator, create outlines and import the .ai into the software.\r\n\r\nCinema
    4D would be my ideal choice.  "
