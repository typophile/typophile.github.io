		<div class="commentbody">When Times Roman was introduced in the 1930s, it was a breath of fresh air. It had a narrow shape to fit well in newspaper columns, and a generous x-height for ease of reading. With its oblique stress, it was much easier on the eye than the newspaper types it replaced, variants of the Scotch Roman family with vertical stress, wide serifs and exaggerated contrast between thick and thin strokes (this example is from the London Times in 1922).
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/london_4679.times.close.jpg]
On the Linotype, Times had not only a bold and an italic, but a bold italic (most text faces didn't), so it became the workhorse typeface for all kinds of text composition. This made it the obvious serif font for the early desktop publishing systems, which caused it to spread like kudzu. 
Like Helvetica, Times is a perfectly good font that was undone by its own success, reduced to the visual equivalent of white noise.

That being said, I agree the guy who combined Times with Comic Sans initials ought to be waterboarded.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The popularity/over-use of a font has only partial relevance to its functionality. Times came out OK in the printing of early 20th century newspapers, but now it's too light and too contrasty. There's actually a nice demi weight of Times, but it's a rara avis. As for Helvetica, its various parameters (vertical proportions, weight, spacing) are out of whack with each other, so it has never really worked well (with the possible exception of the hairline weight at very large sizes). People tend to like Helvetica because they take their particular pet ideology too seriously, subverting the world to it.

		<div class="commentbody">On the one hand, TNR really *is* a great typeface. When the "Times conspiracy" stuff was first big I  spent some time really studying and re-evaluating Times, and decided it is really a great piece of work. Sure, it's overused and I'm tired of it, but the design is really outstanding.

On the other hand, I couldn't agree more with Hrant on Helvetica. Pretty much everything good or useful about Helvetica is all in the associations or image it brings along, not in the actual design or inherent utility of that design. Bleah. But I still have the movie on Blu-ray.  :)

		<div class="commentbody">Yehan (Mark) that was an inside joke about my forthcoming new text Caslon. It's actually not going to be in the same 'space', as it is not so condensed as Times New Roman. I have tried to make it better for many uses, but certainly not for all. 

What Times New Roman did better than any previous face was to cram more letters into the line while remaining very readable, and also achieving a crisp, modern look. The trick, which according to one story was Stanley Morrison's idea, was to put the sharp, lapidary serifs of Gill's Perpetua onto Monotype Plantin. This concept--very well executed by Victor Lardent--made Plantin look more modern and crisp. (There is an alternative theory of the origin of Times Roman, which may be true, but this one reveals what is distinctive about it.)

Times Roman shines at small sizes in narrow columns, and in small format books. The main weakness of Times New Roman to my eyes is that it is a trifle too condensed and dark. 

It is severely compromised with normal margins on letter sized office stationary. At sizes that are good for Times the measure--line length--is too long for comfortable reading. In that sense it was not a great choice for computers, as most of the output from computer goes onto letter sized paper. But it is still one of the great faces of the 20th century. 

Of course it is so ubiquitous that if you want a fresh or distinctive look, it is much easier to go for an alternative. Still, good designers sometimes figure out how to make it look good and fresh again. </div>

I saw that van with the Comic Sans and TNR - sublime, and poignant... Driving home today with my wife in the car, and she pointed out the new sign outside a hotel for which I had designed a logo a couple of years ago...

It had lovely flowing swashes linking two word forms, and now their new sign has the logo with their web address bolted to the top of the swash links, probably using "fit text to path" in CorelDraw... I saw CorelDraw as that is what signwriters use around here and only a signwriter could destroy a perfectly lovely logo by sticking a web address in small sized arial along elements of the logotype!

I say there should be a thread here showing how logo's have been later destroyed by well-meaning third parties.</div>

Signage typefaces are in a league of their own—like, say, typefaces for the screen, for the phone directories, for classified ads, etc. There are a few custom variations of Times New Roman—<em>and</em> Times Roman (those are different typefaces)—created for specific purposes and uses, like Semibold, Claritas, Series 569, Seven, Medium, Small Text, Ten, Eighteen.

Which was a very upmarket newspaper at the time: twice as expensive as the rest, printed with great care on superior paper. The combination of all this resulted in a very nice looking product, which showcased TNR to the fullest.

Later usage has done a lot to diminish this high quality image. And the first digital versions were pretty awful, imo.
It may be just the moment for TNR to make a come back...

We have this currrrrazy hardwiring in our corporate dna that says, if a font was good, great or gorgeous 20, 30, 50, 100, or 200 years ago, there's a reason. :)

The opposite of that, I s'pose, would be that if a font is delivered to millions and or billions of users and it remains generally under to un-used, it must suck. ;)

		<div class="commentbody">TNR did do a comeback in magazines, but that happened already some time ago, so it's starting to feel bit passé to use it nowadays. Beside of FM, I´m thinking of Self Service, 032c, the Finnish Kasino... And a long list of great looking magazines. Great type when used wisely, precisely because of it's over-use, as it has converted it into an "archetypical" serif that doens't draw attention to the choise of typography.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's everywhere because it's still the most readable serif font in existence, with the best economy of space. In fact, the interplay between TNR's readability and economy of space is as close to perfection as you can get. The result? The font itself is invisible, and relative to other serifs that display one kind of affectation or another, TNR actually *helps* the reader.

If you take a closer look, however, you'll find a liveliness and beauty in even the digital version of TNR. It's a work of genius. Most of the other digital classics, like Bembo, Jenson, even Garamonds of one kind or another, even modern greats like Freight, Arno, etc., fade in comparison to TNR in terms of readability. 

It's "overused" for a reason. It's a shame that its apparent overuse has prejudiced so many against it.

Codswallop, my friend. Take any setting using TNR, and I can guarantee it can be made more readable without using more space by using another font. Not by relying on one pre-determined font, but by using a font suited to the point size, line length, paper, etc.

Times hasn't been optimal for many decades.

Yes it is.

At least, it is up to Office 03 on Windows, which a lot of people, especially large corporates, are still using. And even when they switch to 07 which defaults to Calibri, that's a lot of legacy documents.

I am not sure about Macs.</div>

Check the calendar - it's now 2009 :-P

That's like saying Bush is the president - after all he was president for 8 years, Obama only  a couple of months.

Sorry, that doesn't make it "the default", but thanks for playing ;-) </div>
