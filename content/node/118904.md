  somebody will be able to help me with this one, I'm doing some identity work for
  a client who has a pre-existing logo (attached) they would like to keep the current
  typeface as it's been used quite extensively up til now. I'm having trouble matching
  it up, at first I thought it was Impact with a distress effect applied, but it's
  not, any suggestions for a match or alternative close match would be a great help.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nGreg"

  body: "Have you ever gotten a vector version of this logo? \r\n\r\nThe reason I
    ask, is that the colors aren't solid \u2014 there are gradients of color within
    the letters, like where paint would build up on a stamp. It looks like it was
    hand-stamped/painted, scanned, and the t and O were duped. (If so, I'm not sure
    why \u2014 if you're going to actually go through the trouble to hand-make letters,
    why get rid of differences?) If you've only ever had raster/bitmap versions of
    the logo, that would be my guess how it was done.\r\n\r\nSome possible substitutes:\r\n[[http://www.dafont.com/321impact.font?fpp=100&text=fitter+FOOD|321
