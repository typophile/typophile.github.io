  sign has been moved inside and incorporated into the new reception desk.\r\nBuilding
  was built around 1945.\r\n\r\nTrying to ID the font for use in a re-dedication/remodel
  of the building.\r\n(program, posters etc.)\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas?\r\nI can't
  find any fonts close to it.\r\n\r\nIt is a sans serif. \r\nHeavy stem on left side\r\nthe
  bowl of the \"O\" appears pushed to the right from the heavy left\r\nYet the \"A\"
  appears opposite with a heavy right stem.\r\nThe \"S\" and \"C\" appear heavy in
  their middle."

    If you work there could you get a picture from the front of that sign? You probably
    have some print of this signature to summit to us.
