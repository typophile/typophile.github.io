  wisdom... failing that I'm trawling for hours for the answer on google and it'll
  make me cry with frustration!\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to create a series of posters.
  These posters use a font as it's focus \u2013 word play on a font for the purpose
  of creating an amusing poster. I aim to sell the posters. Can I do this? Clearly
  I'll need to license said font to use it on my mac, but then after that I'm unclear
  as to the ramifications.... i.e. commercial gain of using a font to my advantage.\r\n\r\nThe
  posters would only appeal to designs really, as designers more familiar with fonts/typefaces.\r\n\r\nHELP!!!!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks! :)"

  body: to clarify a bit more... I'd be using the name of the font/typeface in a phrase..and
    setting that phrase in the font/typeface i am referencing...

  body: A few foundries explicitly require added fees for something like this, where
    the letters made by the font are the primary thing you are selling. I think you'll
    find that House and P-22 may be in this category.
