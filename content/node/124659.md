body: "I'm stuck with Walkway for a brand and I'm not all that keen on it. It's used
  in the logotype, and is suggested for headers, but I was wondering if there was
  a similar typeface out there that it may have been based on, that I can substitute
  in?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/walkway"

    it's something I'd use again, I could drop \xA3100 on a single cut I suppose?
    That Noir is very nice actually, I don't have anything in that area, and I could
    definitely put it to good use."
