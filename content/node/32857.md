  open type field and the PS field, generated them all as OpenType (otf), threw them
  in Fontbook, where they showed up correctly. I then fired up InDesign CS2.. to see
  that just a few of them showed up, and the menu\xB4s \"building\" the font like
  crazy.. Tested in Photoshop CS2, there it all looks fine. What\xB4s going on?"
