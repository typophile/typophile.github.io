body: "I've created a new version of a typeface for the correct use for \"Office\"
  users, but the small caps won't work... do small caps need an special Unicode to
  work in office? I've seen that there is a Unicode something like 1D00 (for A).\r\n\r\nMy
  typeface had 14 weights... and I've reduced it to 4, and-re named it using TransType
  4\r\n\r\nAny help that I can get in this matter will be welcomed. \r\nThanks!"

  body: You could implement them as a stylistic set. Those do work in Microsoft Office.

    name] SC [style name]. Alegreya, for example.
