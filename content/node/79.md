  body: well, well, well...this is way too much <BR>FFcocon used in three different
    identities &#40;one by a Romanian friend of mine, one by another dutch designer
    and this...&#41; within one week beats my power of understanding. To me, this
    font &#40;an original fontsmith font designed for durex collateral&#41; would
    never do for a logotype ... it has too much distinctiveness in itself to ever
    make a good choice for a corporate identity ... <BR> <BR>george //.

  body: Durex condoms? Interesting. It does look a little rubbery. I think it suits
    logotype better than text, but it does have too much character. Perhaps a little
    refinement could personalize it. <BR> <BR>Is that &#34;s&#34; part of the typeface?
    It looks a little wonky, particularly leading to the spurs. <BR> <BR>The logotype
    looks a little tight in the &#34;sim&#34; or loose in the &#34;pro.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>The proportion of &#34;simpro&#34; to &#34;solutions&#34; is too extreme.
    If the logotype gets any smaller, &#34;solutions&#34; will become specks. <BR>

    &#34;o&#34; looks a little lumpy and complicated. The forms could be smoothed
    and simplified to better effect. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11306.gif"

    <BR> <BR>I agree that &#34;solutions&#34; is too small. I would try putting it
    after &#34;Simpro&#34; in a font that is one to two-thirds the size. In dark blue,
    of course. <BR> <BR>Paul '
