  out how to create an object like the purpley transparent butterfly that InDesign
  uses (or even the transparent-y orange flower on Illustrator) on it's opening page.
  I'm quite lazy and have exhausted trying to figure it out on my own. Thanks for
  any help!\r\n\r\n-S"

    x-rays. He gets black and white images of the flower/butterfly/feather, which
    were colored afterwards.\r\n\r\nI guess there are more simple ways to achieve
    a similar effect.\r\n\r\nCan't find the link where I read this though :(\r\n\r\nedit:
    ah, there it is: http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html"

  body: Actually I think the butterfly falls behind the other motivs. It has almost
    no structure compared to the others.

  body: "If you want to do something like that, in Illustrator CS2 there are some
    nice tools, gradients, transparency, gradient mesh, feather...\r\n\r\nThis was
    drawn in a couple of minutes, it could do with a bit of white in the petals and
    general fixing, but you'll get the idea.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flower.jpg]"

  body: "Hi mili,\r\nThat is exactly what I want to do! Can you be more specific on
    how you did it? I attempted it in Ilustrator with crappy results. I don't have
    the recipe right yet and was dragging and dropping colours onto my gradient mesh.
    It just became a gradient mess! :P If I make a circle do I colour it a radial
    gradient and then apply the gradient mesh? I need help!\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: "sushi whisker,\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the shape add the gradient mesh. Then
    you cold start by coloring all the edges with one colour, then add/change colours
    as needed. You also might need to add occasional mesh point. That quick one was
    done with 4 x 4 mesh and just three colours from the default pallette. I moved
    the points around a bit, too.\r\n\r\nTransparency of the elements is 70%.\r\n\r\nThe
    middle bit has 9 mm feather in the edges and a basic radial gradient. It's also
    transparent (70%) and on top of everything.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, good luck![img:sites/default/files/old-images/mesh.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/radial.jpg]"
