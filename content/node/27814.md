  body: "Can you describe the serifs on the E? The lower one is the key -- is it nearly
    vertical, or is it angled outward? Tha sample is too small to see this detail.
    (Or are you stuck with the same sample we are seeing?)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Golden Cockerel? The image is so blurry. The time frame is about right, though.
    Eric Gill design the typeface in 1929. Eliot wrote Burnt Norton in 1935.

    BURNT NORTON</a> set in the Titling face of Golden Cockerel. Notice the evenly
    weighted U, which was one of the oddities of this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for posting the link that I failed to, Mike. I meant to come back
    and do that.\r\n\r\nThe only other digital version of Golden Cockerel that I'm
    aware of is Nick Curtis' <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/c.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Chanticleer</a> (one of his early freebies). In the accompanying
    ReadMe, he stated that Chanticleer was an attempt to replace the \"idiosyncrasies
    and charm\" that ITC's version removed."
