  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a resource that shows Hotel logos/signage/promotion from the teens (as in 1910-1920).</p>
<p>I have several good books on design history (including Steven Heller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graphic Style&rdquo; and &ldquo;Typology&rdquo; &ndash; both of them great btw &ndash; as well as Philip Meggs' book) but there seems to be this gap between late Victorian/Arts&amp;Crafts and early Modernism in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m looking for the commercial &ldquo;vernacular&rdquo; design of American hotels, not the avant garde of European art/design movements of the time, which I&rsquo;m assuming were in a completely different place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing my resources are going to be limited, so I&rsquo;m open to expanding the pool of sources to include restaurant graphics, matchbook covers, signage, advertising, etc. from the period.</p>
<p>Any ideas anyone has for books, online resources, etc., would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Rob</p>

<p>They won&rsquo;t be good books until they recognize the dominant role of Historicism in 20th century mass media, especially during the first three decades.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An interesting tangent you might follow in this pursuit would be to look at the big ATF specimen books from the early 20th century: 1906, 1912, 1923. Probably also the big BB&amp;S book from that period. To illustrate how types might be used, advertisements for businesses were included on many pages. The businesses were for the most part made-up, just as today many design students create businesses on which to base their identity projects. I&rsquo;m sure there were hotel ads.</p>
<p>So it gets a bit fanciful, since these were not likely to be real businesses. But it may give a view of what was considered to be the &ldquo;way&rdquo; hotel ads were to look. &amp; you&rsquo;d probably find better composition than in the Biltmore ad Nick shows us.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with the composition.
I particularly like the way the block of small caps centres under the &ldquo;BILTMORE&rdquo; and the archway in the illustration.
But I guess you mean compositor composition, not layout composition.
In which case, I have to say&ndash;they even kerned the LT!</p>
<p>However, although they were able to close up between &ldquo;w&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, because it&rsquo;s just a thin space, they weren&rsquo;t able to kern between &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and &ldquo;o&rdquo;, and didn&rsquo;t bother to put a thinner space between ALL and THEATRES&ndash;but then, that&rsquo;s extremely small type.
&ldquo;New York&rdquo; was a huge colour problem back in the days of metal.</p>
