  \r\n\r\nI found out about this via TypoToken. \r\nhttp://www.typetoken.net/publication/paul-rands-jan-tschicholds-type-specimen-book\r\n "

  body: "Your specimen is from a 19th century specimen book of \"Caratteri di legno\"
    -- wood type characters -- published by Romano Scherer.  \r\n\"Cicero\" was a
    big size of type, note how it fills the page. This type would have been used for
    display advertising.\r\nThere was a great variety of wooden type but, as Ryuk
    already mentioned, this style was commonly called Roman. Note the ball terminal
    on _c_. This is a 19th century version of the high contrast \"modern\" style developed
    by Didot and Bodoni in the 18th century.\r\nMany 19th century foundries did not
    provide names for their typefaces, but merely used numbers. Sometimes, as in this
    case, they used different numbers for different sizes of the same typeface design.\r\n19th
    century foundries frequently copied the designs of other foundries. A check of
    specimen books of William Page and James Hamilton might provide more letters with
    the same design as the Romano Scherer specimen. A good place to start is Luc Devroye's
    page on the Hamilton Holly Wood Type Co. http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-39705.html\r\nAFAIK
    this specific typeface has not been digitized.\r\nFor substitutes with the flavor
    of the typeface I recommend Penny and  Roman X, both already suggested by Ryuk.\r\nDick
    Pape digitized many of Hamilton's typefaces in his American Wood Type collection.
    It might be worth going though them. They are hosted by Luc Devroye http://luc.devroye.org/pape\r\nDon\r\n"
