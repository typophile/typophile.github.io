  body: "You can approximate this probably custom lettering with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stymie/|Stymie]].
    The Black weight is closest except for the y. Oddly, the Black y is different
    from the other weights. I think if you added stroke to the Bold weight you would
    be able to fake it. The M is also a bit different, crotch-wise, but you could
    edit it or ignore the difference.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think you're right. That is pretty close. I modified some rockwell (made
    a new \"e,\" shortened the serifs, tweaked some other points) and got it close
    enough.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com\" target=\"_blank\">evan</a>"
