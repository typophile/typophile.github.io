  Amsterdam and Paris, and I would like for the sans serif to be from one country
  and the serif to be from the other, but I am not sure where to start. The two fonts
  need to work with each other, but if possible, keep a characteristic from that region.
  If anyone knows any good fonts from these countries please let me know. THANKS."

    the body text of his book. But I forget the name. :-/  ITC Mendoza has a similar
    flavor.\r\n\r\nDutch: too many great choices! I might actually go for one that's
    not too mainstream. Do you want oldschool or newschool?\r\n\r\nBut yeah, what's
    your budget?  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Being that this is a personal project my budge can increase with desire.
    I want to make a nice book so if I love a font and feel it as the right one, I
    will spend what I need. All within reason though. \r\n\r\nAs for oldschool or
    newschool, I feel as if my photography in the book is very modern and personal,
    so maybe a more oldschool font will help to bring a balance to the book? \r\n\r\ni
    looked at Mendoza and feel that it could be a good font for my use. So maybe if
    there is a good font from the Netherlands that would compliment it, I would love
    to know what it would be. The font has to work as a display size, and will be
    used more for short headlines that will included numerals. \r\n\r\nThanks so much
    for your expertise\r\n\r\n-Joe"

  body: "Would you use Mendoza for the text or for display? That would depend on things
    like the amount of text. In any case, I can't immediately think of a Dutch face
    (old or new) that would nicely match Mendoza. Maybe FB Proforma*? Anyway, a very
    oldschool Dutch font is Fleischmann (even though the guy was actually German).\r\n\r\n*
