  | Myfonts.com]].  \r\n\r\nPaveline is a punctuated script; by which we mean it has
  the look and character of handwriting, but the glyphs are discrete entities to aid
  legibility. It is actually based on a moderately stylized adaptation of our chief
  designer\u2019s handwriting. Use it to give a handwritten touch to your work. Paveline
  works well as small handwriting or large scale poster captions.  You can see some
  more samples of Paveline in action on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/31234_5327.png]"

    third time I\u2019ve seen a promotional image that suggests you don\u2019t know
    how to design type or how to use Photoshop. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop focusing
    on volume and start fixing all those bad overlaps and giant gaps."
