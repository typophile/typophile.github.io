    Baiti is a font created for a very specific non-latin script* so arguably the
    latin part of it is based on an already existing latin typeface.\r\nI would try
    something like Nimbus Sans Novus** or other Helvetica (Neue) version.\r\n\r\n*

    the way, nowadays Macs use Windows fonts just fine."
