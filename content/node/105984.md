  been looking everywhere for the script font used in this image, an ad for Los Santos
  in GTAV. It's just perfect. I've tried using font identification websites such as
  whatthefont but to no avail.. I've found similar fonts, such as wisdomscript, pacifico,
  missionscript, recklame, and lobster, but nothing close enough to the one used in
  this image.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping its not a custom font created by rockstar because
  I love it already and want to use it :P\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me out that'd
  be great!\r\nThanks!"
