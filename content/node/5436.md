  the &#34;Yes, America Can!&#34; font on the main banner at <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/">http://www.georgewbush.com/</a>?
  It seems to be used throughout the page &#40;in the right sidebar headers, e.g.
  &#34;BUSH-CHENEY coalitions&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any guidance! <BR> <BR>&#60;&#60;

  body: 'The &#34;Yes, America...&#34; font is Verdana Bold. The one used for the
    subheads on the right is a different font -- Arial Black, I believe. '
