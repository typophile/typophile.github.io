  etc.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to author the typographic content
  of these stamps? So far I have only managed to create 'user stamps', which are scans,
  not inbuilt information. In short I want to preserve the typeface (which is lovely
  and bitmapped) but with different text.\r\n\r\nThanks, as always\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the operations manual. It's usually stored in a slot behind one of the service
    doors on the unit. That should provide some hints."

  body: "Thanks, sorry for the slow reply. It seems that a lot of Canon photocopiers
    have this function, which allows you to create your own stamps in Courier. I found
    some manuals hidden inside the machines but the majority of their content was
    concerned with fax, not copy for some reason.\r\n\r\nIn the end I used an Aficio
    model, with the default stamps. It was some kind of bitmapped and stretched Times
    I think. Yes stretched :)\r\n\r\nCheers"
