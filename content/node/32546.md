  font. I am looking for background information about the use of serif fonts in internet
  design. Are there serif fonts specialy designed for use on the internet? Where do
  I have pay attention to?\r\n\r\nI am going to use the font in headings and in body
  text in combination with Arial or Verdana. Important is that the font is legiblel
  and that it looks friendly. Wich serif fonts do you recommend? \r\n\r\nThanks for
  your reaction!"

    in smaller sizes on both OS, Georgia. Which is used at typophile.com too.\r\nCheck
    out this Georgia/Verdana-combination at <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/multicolumnlayouts\">alistapart.com</a>.\r\n\r\n*
    if not, you can use Flash with the possibility to embed the (dynamic) font(s)
    in the .swf. Or a combination (html, css, flash) called sIFR."

  body: For body text, CSS is recommended. So [[Georgia]] is the way to go.

  body: "Thanks for your reaction. My question was not specific enough. Sorry for
    that. So I try again.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in the technics of using fonts
    on internet. (We are working with sIFR) But I would like to know if there are
    serif fonts who are specialy designed for use on internet. Just like ther are
    fonts designed or adapted for use in newspaper. So do they exist? It has to be.
    And wich fonts do you recommend? They must be legiblel and friendly and have a
    modern appearance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The Lucida series (Bright, Standard, Typewriter are serifs) has been optimized
    for screen, so that would be a good choice.

  body: "\"But I would like to know if there are serif fonts who are specialy designed
    for use on internet.\"\r\n\r\nAs stated many times: Georgia. That's pretty much
    the only one that's likely to be installed on a majority of user's computers.\r\n\r\nFor
    headers, if you are using sIFR, use any typeface you like. Obvoiusly, screens
    are lower resolution than paper, so that's the one key difference you will have
    to pay attention to. Any typeface that uses hairline details likely wouldn't be
    a good candidate for on-screen use.\r\n\r\nI do hope you aren't using sIFR for
    body text. That's not a great idea."
