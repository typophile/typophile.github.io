  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"> I just recently was exposed to type design via the Fontographer program. I love to look at letter forms. This site is pretty good for new people like me. <BR> <BR>I have searched the Internet for more information on some questions that I need answering but I was not able to get the answers. <BR> <BR>I will post them here for discussion. <BR> <BR>8 Are there any prominent African-American type designers. <BR> <BR>8 What is the difference between the following terms; gothic, grotesque, grotesk, and sans. <BR> <BR>8 Who made the first computer or digital font. <BR> <BR>8 Who is considered the best in this field as far as individuals and foundries. Is there a font considered the best font. These examples I could study and use their accomplishments as models. <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance. <BR> <BR>Terry Wilson </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; I love to look at letter forms. <BR> <BR>Then you&#39;re halfway there! Well, at least a quarter. <BR> <BR>&#62; Are there any prominent African-American type designers <BR> <BR>You know, that&#39;s a question &#42;nobody&#42; dares to ask... I think the fact that there are virtually &#42;none&#42; in the field &#40;go to an ATypI conference, and you&#39;ll see&#41; means nobody wants to face the issue. <BR> <BR>The only one I&#39;ve seen in a picture &#40;I&#39;ve never had the pleasure of meeting him in person, so I&#39;m not 100% sure&#41; is Joshua Darden&#42;, and I think he might be half &#40;if that matters&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.typography.com/profile/index.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.typography.com/profile/index.html</A> <BR> <BR>&#62; What is the difference between the following terms; gothic, grotesque, grotesk, and sans <BR> <BR>Depends who you ask. My advice is: don&#39;t ask.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#62; Who is considered the best in this field as far as individuals and foundries <BR> <BR>Terry, it takes somebody fresh like you to ask such a brazen question. Thank you. Some people would call that a simple-minded question, but at its heart is the desire for insight - and that&#39;s a great thing. <BR> <BR>Dead people, I&#39;d would cite two: Robert Granjon, Eric Gill. <BR>Living people: If I were &#42;forced&#42; to choose one person, I would have to say Matthew Carter. But I would quickly add some of my favorites, like Gerard Unger and Lee Schulz and Evert Bloemsma and .... <BR> <BR>The thing is, you don&#39;t have to look for &#42;the&#42; best - there&#39;s so much to learn from so many designers, almost any of them, in fact - as long as you know what to look for. For example, a designer could be very good at making pretty letterforms, without the ability to space the font properly. Or a designer could be very good at making text fonts, but couldn&#39;t make a hip display font if you held a gun to his head. <BR> <BR>To elaborate further, different people are good at different things, so if you can focus on individual aspects of the craft and ask again &#40;like right here&#41;, then you might get some very specific recommendations of whose fonts to peruse. Just one thing, in case it needs saying: if/when you open the fonts of others, don&#39;t re-use the actual curves! Also, whenever you draw substantial inspiration from a specific design or designer, try to give credit, in public. <BR> <BR>BTW, Terry: thank you so much for being here!! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Thank you for your responses. Were there any others.  <BR> <BR>Two more questions. Are there more forums like this on the internet. Maybe a graphic design forum would be cool. <BR> <BR>Also how can I find out who made the first computer font. <BR> <BR>As far as being an African American woman, there are a lotof other fields that are under-represented. I&#39;d like to pick one and be somewhat of a pioneer. Though I have gone through this site and I&#39;m not sure that type design is for me I&#39;ll definitely keep it in mind. I also know that there are alot of great type designers who are women. I would like to use my painting background but be more than just a painter. I&#39;ll figure it out. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR> <BR>Terry </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Maybe a graphic design forum would be cool.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s almost too many forums, actually. <BR>What I would recommend is becoming a member of Typo-L&#42; first, and then asking there for more leads. <BR> <BR>&#42; Somewhere in here: <A HREF="http://listserv.heanet.ie/" TARGET="_top">http://listserv.heanet.ie/</A> <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;d like to pick one and be somewhat of a pioneer. <BR> <BR>Now that&#39;s called planning ahead! And a killer plan it is. Don&#39;t be afraid to leverage your minoritiness - as long as you don&#39;t let that on... <BR> <BR>Anyway, I hope you choose the craft of type design, but wherever you go, good luck! BTW, although this list is representative of type design as a whole in &#42;some&#42; ways &#40;like the obsessivity, and the bickering&#41;, it&#39;s not really a reliable way to gauge what it &#42;really&#42; is. Not that it&#39;s the same thing to each of us anyway, especially these days of so called &#34;democratized&#34; type design. <BR> <BR>&#62; I also know that there are alot of great type designers who are women. <BR> <BR>There are? I&#39;ve always felt there aren&#39;t enough, and some of the ones we have &#40;and have had&#41; tend to get &#34;celebrity&#34; syndrome - like Warde, who wasn&#39;t even a designer. I would point to Jill Bell as a very good type designer who doesn&#39;t get enough attention. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
