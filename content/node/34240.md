  Now that the release date has been <A HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/04/iphone-launch-date-roundup/">announced</A>,
  and you have 25 days to come up with the money which typophiles are ready to drop
  $.6K on the new phone come June 29? '

  body: I have a personal rule that disallows me from getting first generation, version
    one hardware from a computer company. (But that didn't stop me from getting a
    Samsung Blackjack.) Our office will get at least one to test and tinker with.

  body: The MacBooks, version 1.0 (or is it 0.0) had some hardware issues. The very
    next release of the MacBook was only a few months later. So, I'm expecting hardware
    revs to be soon and will consider one then.

    PDAs and don\u2019t want or need another. Digital convergence usually fails to
    impress me, so even if I would be getting a phone, camera, music player, video
    player and PDA for $600, I don\u2019t care. And I\u2019m not masochistic enough
    to buy a first-gen Apple product."

  body: My Samsung Blackjack has a 3G data plan from Cingular. The 3G network alone
    is enough to make the upgrade to a smartphone or an iPhone. I have no complaints
    about Cingular.

  body: "Well, according to the Rogers email to subscribers cited <a href=\"http://andrewescobar.com/archive/2007/01/15/rogers-to-offer-iphone-exclusivly-in-canada/\">here</a>
    (which I didn't get, although I am a long-time one....), Rogers will be the exclusive
    carrier for them here, although they haven't officially released a date or cost.\r\n\r\nAs
    the author of the article linked above said <em>Knowing the way Rogers operates,
    availability in October 2007 for CND$699 with a 3 year contract would be disappointing
    but it would not surprise me.</em>  Given what they've done in the past with other
    technologies, that sounds about right...."

  body: "I would like to have one but the cost associated with buying and owning the
    device make it prohibitive for me. 499 plus what ever AT&T will charge for voice
    and data. Oh and another thing... AT&T/Cingular was rated poorest in service by
    Consumer Reports. T-Mobile being the best for GSM is my choice. \r\n\r\nLike others
    have mentioned, the version 2.0 will probably be better. And one thing that bugs
    me about Apple's new devices is the screen aspect ratio is not compatible with
    the HD 16:9 standard. Jobs at one time proclaimed the year of high-def but that
    never came to fruition in their products.\r\n\r\nI still like my free Nokia phone
    too...\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: I'll get one as soon as it hits Denmark. As for the price, 600$ is nothing
    for a phone. There are plenty of 1000$ phones sold in Denmark, with a lot less
    "slick" or "cool" than the iPhone.
