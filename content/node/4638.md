body: 'For those that are interested, a 15 minute programme about the work of Margaret
  Calvert and the designs for contemporary UK traffic signs. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr
  size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>Routemasters 1/5. The Blue and the Green. <BR>
  <BR>A five-part celebration of some of our most familiar, but unrecognised design
  classics: the road sign, the white line, the roundabout, the green man and the traffic
  calmer. Some are regarded as international design classics, others bemuse overseas
  visitors as eccentric. But as Joe Kerr finds out behind them lie forgotten histories,
  and fifty years of combined brainpower from typographers, psychologists, engineers
  and ordinary members of the public. <BR> <BR>In the first programme, Joe meets the
  woman who was one half of the partnership who in the 1960s came up with the distinctive
  look of British road signs. Today they are heralded as a triumph of design. And
  if you&#39;ve ever wondered who drew the pictures on our signs - this programme
  reveals all.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR>It is on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/"
  target="_blank">BBC Radio 4</a> at 09:30 Tuesday 11 May. <BR> <BR>It might only
  be on for 15 minutes, but it is just the sort of thing the BBC does very well. <BR>
  <BR>I see that Ole Lund will be presenting about <a href="http://www.atypi.org/08_Prague/30_program/20_main_program/view_presentation_html?presentid=86"

  body: So if I tune in on their website at 1:30 AM where I am &#40;Los Angeles&#41;
    I should catch it? <BR>Do they typically re-broadcast, or maybe provide an archive?
    <BR>If not, is there a way to <i>record</i> it on my end? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    so if you have a way of capturing that

  body: While UK traffic signage is ok on main routes, its a shame that over zealous
    bureaucrats have tried to root out all of the old style signs, even on the quietest
    backroads.  <BR>The older signs had far more character, exhibited regional variation
    and were perfectly adequate for the needs of smaller roads. <BR>There are still
    some of the old type left, but don&#39;t tell the MoT &#40;sorry, the Highways
    Agency&#41; or they too will be replaced by characterless reflective plastic.
    <BR>&#40;In the very unlikely event that anyone cares, I&#39;ve got a 1954 Highway
    Code booklet, so I could upload some scans to illustrate the difference&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;As if it wasn&#39;t bad enough that so many red phone boxes were
    replaced by the aluminium &amp; plastic things which seem to have been designed
    specifically to prevent anyone making a phone call in them&#41;. <BR> <BR>

  body: Well I thought it was a very interesting little programme, not technical,
    but entertaining. Anyone interested can catch it again <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/rams/tue0930.ram"
    target="_blank">here</a> <BR> <BR>I know where you&#39;re coming from Steve. On
    an aeshetic level, I don&#39;t like much of it &#40;personally I think Transport
    is quite unpleasant&#41; but I believe that it does work very well as an entire
    scheme. <BR> <BR>I would be interested to see some scans of your 1954 Highway
    Code.
