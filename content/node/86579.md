  also use existing fonts or maybe scans of old typefaces, etc.?

  body: "To me, a \"Letterer\" is someone who draws letters in sequence as part of
    words rather than using an already created typeface to \"set\" the words.  This
    does not mean that the letters they draw must avoid looking like something we
    have already seen elsewhere.  It was quite common for lettering artists and sign
    painters to learn several commonly used lettering styles--many of these lettering
    styles were later revived as a typeface.  This does not mean that they are required
    to use brush and pen, they can also use today's bezier curve drawing software
    or any other means of \"drawing\" )as long as they are not just copying and pasting
    the glyph from another source).\r\nThe idea is that lettering is done in context
    and with respect to the exact needs of the text itself. A Letterer can make adjustments
    to shape and position of letters based on its neighbors best fit and not be confined
    to only one capital \"A\" for example.  Think of it as one step beyond a custom
    typeface which may fulfill the needs of a client for many texts, instead it just
    fulfills the needs of the few words being drawn and at the size and colors needed
    at the moment."

  body: "Jargon can vary between industries. Large comic book publishers continue
    to employ \"letterers\", but the job now usually consists of typesetting with
    a comic font.\r\n\r\nWe type people most use \"lettering\" to describe lettering
    that is not type, but in the broader sense it may be said that type is also lettering,
    as it is hard to argue with the common-sense definition that to letter is to make
    or apply letters. For instance, the old Chartpak/Letraset/Prestype stuff was advertised
    as \"dry transfer lettering\" or \"rub-on lettering\" even though it was a means
    of using typefaces."

    draw, amend type and/or do anything to make letters work.\r\n\r\nLife is short,
    the art is long :-)"
