    not typeset.\r\n\r\nNot finding anything particularly close. Shares some characteristics
    with Kabel and Bernhard Gothic...."

  body: "Thank you K.C. Thompson and LiLianJie for your help! \r\n\r\nK.C. Thompson's
    suggestion Kabel seems closer to me, only because of the angled terminals of the
    E and L. The G seems pretty special, too. And the extended horizontal bar of two
    of the A's in the title. I wonder if any types uses an F like the one in \"Farewell\"?"

  body: "Martin, I searched on the title as a whole, the author's name as a whole,
    and then on individual letters. No luck on finding anything comparable to that
    F.\r\n\r\nIf you search on Google, a later (mid 1930s) German edition actually
    used Kabel on the cover. Your options are to find a sans serif that is close to
    the proportions of the original and customize it, or work backwards from Kabel."
