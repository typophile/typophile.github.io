  sample here on a wheel: http://www.amclassic.com/enlarge/carbon58.jpg\r\n\r\nand
  a vector version on the last page of the PDF here: http://www.amclassic.com/pdfs/OwnersManual.pdf,
  although this looks rather anaemic and poorly spaced compared to other two samples,
  as if it's missing its outer edge?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n"

  body: "Cheers Ignacio!\r\n\r\nThat looks to be it, but just wondering given Mr Park's
    Puma and Snickers fonts, whether it might actually be based on the logo. Do you
    know any more?\r\n\r\nEdit: going by http://www.ethancote.com/fonts/samuel_park.html
    this would appear to be the case: <cite>Other fonts I've created is a bunch of
    low quality 'based-on-logotypes-fonts like 'Park', 'Supreme', 'Freak out - Go
    bananas', 'Lunch time', 'What time is it?' and a couple of other.</cite>\r\n\r\nAlso
    found what looks like the same font, same author, called \"Bauer\" -- as in the
    ice hockey company -- which is more likely to be the logo he was looking to emulate.
    Bauer appear to have changed their logo face since and I can't find a sample.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The American Classic logo was probably only created in the last 2 years,
    but I guess I'm really after the original font if one exists. \r\n\r\nI'm sure
    I saw the old Bauer logo on rollerskates around 1987 so the question should now
    be what font was used there.\r\n\r\nStill can't find a proper sample, below is
    the preview image from Samuel Park's \"Bauer\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauer_5226.gif]"
