  recreate his logo.  I've looked at tens of thousands of files, yet I cannot seem
  to find the name of this particular font.  The closest I've seen is D3 Mouldism
  Round Alphabet, but it's not quite right.  Any help would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  and have a wonderful holiday weekend.\r\n\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AshbyLogo600px_4231.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/D3-Mouldism-Round-Alphabet_4377.jpg]"

    the whole thing in Illustrator? It\u2019s a matter of minutes!\r\nAnd fixing the
    horizontals would definitely do no harm\u2026"
