body: "Flying out of Frankfurt today I kept noticing a guy on the plane that looked
  familiar. Then I realized it was [[John D Berry]]. So great to see a familiar (and
  friendly!) face in a foreign country. We shared a cab to our respective hotels.
  \r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing the city's massive monuments to autocrats,
  wars and past glory. I'm also hoping to get my fill of cyrillic alphabets; enough
  to perhaps finish my own cyrillic alphabets I've started. \r\n\r\nThe theme of ATypI
  is \"The Old and The New\". Paying 500 rubles (about $20) for 5 hours of wireless
  internet while sitting in a smoky lounge -- since I can't get wireless in my hotel
  room -- feels like a hearty dose of the <em>old</em>. I'm looking forward to some
  <em>new</em>. I'm really interested to see what local designers in Russia are working
  on right now.\r\n\r\nI'll post notes here when I have pics up on Flickr. You're
  welcome to see pics from my recent week at IBC Conference in Amsterdam. What an
  amazing week. http://www.flickr.com/photos/joepemberton/sets/72157607293196891/\r\n\r\nI'm
  also microblogging via our Twitter stream. Follow Typophile at http://www.twitter.com/typophile/\r\n\r\nAll
  for now."
