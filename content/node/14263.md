  body: "I think you should get Pro Edition. If you are getting another PC for a member
    of your family who just use the PC for basic internet use or school work, then
    get Home.\r\n\r\nIf you are getting a PC put together from components, think about
    getting the OEM version of whichever edition you choose. Its half price ... one
    caveat is that the license is tied to the hardware, it means you cannot move that
    version of windows to another PC after Activation (30 days). If you don't activate
    during that 30 days, you can't do Windows update (a simple workaround was published
    in slashdot regarding this). What happens if you don't activate? Answered here
    (http://www.annoyances.org/exec/forum/winxp/t1010414167)\r\n\r\nSo after activation
    you will not be allowed to install it to another PC even if your PC exploded!
    I think the activation might be tied to the motherboard and processor? My harddisk
    recently broke and had to change the drive, this was allowed, but could notdo
    activation over the internet anymore, you will have to call a provided number
    by the activation screen (it is so annoying being treated like a crook when you
    paid for the goods!!). I was plenty stressed out during re-installation, was relieved
    that that was allowed (very very annoying).\r\n\r\nSince you are getting XP, beware
    fo spyware, adware and viruses, plenty of online articles regarding how to protect
    yourself from these. When surfing the internet use Firefox instead of IE as your
    main browser.\r\n\r\nugh I'm so longwinded ..."

  body: "The biggest difference for normal home use seems to be that the Home edition
    makes it harder for you to play around in the system files. This can normally
    be got around by using safe mode. I've had to do this once or twice to remove
    nasty viruses. Nearly all default settings treat you like you're an idiot, but
    they can mostly be changed.\r\n\r\nIf it's for 'nothing special, really...' I'd
    save your money and go with Home.\r\n\r\nEd.\r\n\r\n(ps. yes, as Edwh said, the
    first things to get are a firewall* and antivirus software**, don't trust the
    ones that come built in.\r\n\r\n*<a href=\"http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp?lid=dbtopnav_zass\">

    Windows XP and I haven't really noticed a difference at all.  So I'd recommend
    getting Home and saving some $'s."

    'crippled pain-in-the-ass windows xp'\r\n\r\nIf you just browse the web and type
    emails, then it doesn't really matter. If you are the least bit geeky though,
    and want to dive into the guts a bit easier and/or do things like web development
