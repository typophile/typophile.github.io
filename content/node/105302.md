  J have little serifs, and I want to carry over the alternates to the small caps.
  I'm getting a little stuck on the scripting. (Massive newbie on the scripting btw).
  \r\n\r\nSo when Small Caps are on with alternates the small cap serif I will be
  displayed instead of tthe small cap I.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

  body: Features are applied in order. So if your small caps feature comes first,
    make sure your stylistic alternate code changes both caps and small caps to the
    alternates. And if your alternate features comes first, make sure your small caps
    code "small-capifies" both the standard and the alternate letters.
