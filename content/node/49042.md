  word is skewed...\r\n\r\nThe designer who did this project a few years ago has left
  the company and did not leave an editable copy behind... it's all outlined.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I could find was Univers 85 Black.  There are large differences however,
  in the stroke of the M's and the spine of the S.  The crossbar's are all too long
  as well.\r\n\r\nI suppose this entire thing could have been skewed and I'm screwed
  either way..."
