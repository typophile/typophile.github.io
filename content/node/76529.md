  dont almost half of ligatues in GSUB lookups and compiled and test are working fine
  but know I am adding some more ligatures lookups and when I am compiling it it gives
  message that COMPILATION FAILED and I have check my lookup every thing is look fine
  and correct tome \r\nwhat can be the possible reason becuse the volt does not give
  the full details that why compilation is faild what is the reason?\r\nThanks\r\nBest

  body: "Thank John for your valuable comments\r\nDear John I have one more question
    do we have any limitation that how many GSUB lookup tables can be use in each
    font or we can make as much GSUB lookup tables as much we need to build our font\r\nand
    2nd question is in each GSUB Lookup table how many ligatures entries we can put
    do we have any limitation or we can add as much as we need \r\nthis answer will
    really sort out my problem\r\nI am still confused whether the errors I am getting
    this is becuase I have more GSUB Tables in my font\r\nor this error is becasue
    I have more entries in each GSUB Lookup\r\nyour early reply will be highly appreciated\r\nThanks\r\njnbaluch"

  body: "John\r\nThanks very much when I have turn on the extension lookup and know
    there is no compilation error message and the work is going on fine. great May
    god bless you\r\nThanks once agains for this great help\r\n\r\nI have one more
    question as I told you before I am making a Urdu Nastaleeq font where I am using
    approx 25000 ligatues \r\nI have done Init, medi and fina lookup and ligatues
    lookups are also there but when I compile the font and test it all initial medial
    and final letters work fine wherever the ligatures are there they dont appear
    as ligature, but when I remove the init, medi and fina feature and keep only liga
    feature and test only ligaturs are comes fine\r\nI want in font the ligature should
    have first priority to appears and when for the particular word the ligature is
    not availabe then only the init medi and fina should work \r\nhow to do this\r\ndo
    I am doing a wrong positioning of lookup and I know the order of look in lookup
    list is very important\r\nbut I tried to keep init on top and medi and fina after
    liga lookups and viseversa but both the way ligatures dont come if init medi final
    are there\r\nwaiting for your kind reply\r\nThanks\r\nBest Regards\r\njnbaluch\r\n"

  body: "OpenType Arabic script layout engines will apply the init, medi and fina
    (and isol, if present in the font) before they apply the ligature features. This
    means that the input glyph sequences in your ligature lookups need to be the init,
    medi etc. forms. So e.g. (using the glyph name convention I use in my Arabic projects):\r\n\r\naLam.init
    aAlif.fina -> aLam_aAlif\r\naLam.medi aAlif.fina -> aLam_aAlif.fina\r\n\r\nrather
    than\r\n\r\naLam aAlif -> aLam_aAlif\r\n\r\naLam_aAlif -> aLam_aAlif.fina\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Regarding your other question, on the number of ligatures per lookup, I'm
    afraid I don't know the answer. There certainly would be a limit, but I'm not
    sure whether simply invoking the extension mechanism resolves this.\r\n\r\nHave
    you considered splitting your ligatures into a small set of contextual variant
    glyphs and strokes and combining them dynamically using the curs (cursive attachment)
    feature? This seems to me much more efficient and flexible than creating 25,000
    ligatures."

  body: "Thank John for your valuable comments and reply\r\nas you said the arabic
    script layout engine read the init, medi and final first and then ligatures, I
    also want it should read the init, medi and fina firt to create the word but once
    that word match the ligature it should jump and show the ligatue instead of init,
    medi and fina word,\r\nand normally all arabic and urdu font do so, \r\nwhat should
    I do in glyph naming or GSUB naming or their sequences fo get the desire rusult
    \r\nand the way which you explain in your reply I did not understand \r\nis it
    possible please explain it little more details\r\nthanks\r\nBest Regards\r\n"

  body: "The input sequences for the ligature substitutions, that is the list of letter
    form glyphs that become the ligature, must be the init, medi and fina forms, because
    these are the forms that will exist in the glyph string after the processing of
    those features and before the processing of the ligature feature. Whatever you
    have called the init form of letters, the medi form of letters and the fina form
    of letters, these are the names that you need to use, in the appropriate order,
    as input for your ligature substitutions. So, for example, you might have called
    your init glyphs *.init, where * is the name of the default letter glyph, e.g.
    lam, so: lam.init, lam.medi and lam.fina. So the input sequence for an isolated
    lam+yeh ligature would be lam.init yeh.fina, while the sequence for a lam+yeh
    ligature in a final posision would be lam.medi yeh.fina. \r\n\r\nIf you name your
    ligature glyphs so that they represent the input glyph sequence, e.g. calling
    a ligature glyph lam.init_yeh.fina, then it is very easy to create the lookups."

    John or Sergey thats solve these problems i thankful you whole life. I am waiting
