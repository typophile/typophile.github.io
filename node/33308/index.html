  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We were trying to change a font from .TTF to .OTF. FontLab 5.0.2 stated that it could not export a font with more than 6,401 glyphs. I can't find that in the manual or as a search topic at Typophile. Was that FL message accurate, or have I done something wrong?

P.S. Yes, I know most printer's RIPs will now handle .TTF fonts. But that hasn't always filtered down to the printers MSRs, so they preflight it, then reject a job because it has "Truetype" fonts. You always seem to loose a few days in the production schedule. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks John. We got up with the printer, who agreed to try the .TTF font if we would send a test file. Let's hope it works; a $1,400 upgrade is a bit more that we want to spend.

Odd journal (named <cite>boundary 2</cite>). It uses Helvetica for the text font, so when Chinese appears, our usual Chinese fonts don't look right. And no, I didn't design it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles, 

information about the limitation has existed on the "Specifications" section of the FontLab Studio web page ever since the product was released: 
http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/

and is also included on:
http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/

It is also described on page 20 of the FontLab Studio manual that says: "Open, edit and generate OpenType PS, TrueType / OpenType TT and PostScript Type 1 formats with up to 6,400 characters", as well as on page 152. 

If you need to generate an OpenType PS font with more than 6,400 glyphs, you can either use TypeTool 3 (which is just $99) or AsiaFont Studio 4, which both can generate fonts with up to 65,535 glyphs.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, I wasn't complaining particularly, just trying to confirm that the message I got was in fact correct, and I hadn't done some bone-head thing & was getting an error message really cause by that. Well, I'll complain a little about the manual. I'm an index user & really like comprehensive indexes. I realize paying good indexer is an expensive proposition. Anyway, for whatever reason, I have a lot of trouble finding specific things in the manual -- the PDF version, maybe there is another?

And you are quite right, after John Hudson pointed it out, we found the 6,100 glyph limitation on the FontLab web site.

We have TransType 3 on our old iMac & it ground & ground for a while, then quit. I suspect it just ran out of memory. Sound like our best solution, if the printer rejects the .TTF format, is to get TypeTool3 for one of the up-to-date Windows machines we have. We have several Chinese fonts; all have more than 6,100 glyphs, and the ones most compatible with Helvetica are in the TTF format -- also the one that has both "standard" and "bold" weights, which has also come up once or twice.

Thanks for the help.</div>
