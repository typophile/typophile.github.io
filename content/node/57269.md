  body: "I couldn't find anything particularly similar, but the best candidate starting
    points I would pick are [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/keyboard-rr/|Keyboard]]
    from Red Rooster, or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/onyx-mt/|Onyx]] from
    Monotype. Both have similar contrast and shape to Dollhouse, but both would need
    a lot of changes, particularly to the terminals. Onyx at least has some ball terminals.\r\n\r\n-
