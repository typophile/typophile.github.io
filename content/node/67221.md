  Ars Technica article on text legibility issues with the new Mass Effect 2 game.
  The discussion is interesting in regards to how much flexibility developers should
  give to the players over how the text is rendered and such impact on the game design.
  As we move beyond existing standards, I believe these types of problems will become
  much more commonplace."

    that aesthetics are matched to technical capabilities, whether rendering environments
    or type. '

  body: For the hardware (set top box and console) as well as games developers the
    SD experience is still important, esp outside of the US and Europe. I'm a bit
    surprised this wasn't tested. All the devs I've ever worked with have a crappy
    tube TV for testing.
