  and for some of the headlines we would like to use a font similar to the handwritten
  logo.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend handwritten/script fonts that are similar to the
  letters used in this logo? The more similar the better. It needs to be a font including
  caps and the Danish characters \xE6\xF8\xE5, \xC6\xD8\xC5.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    in developing a typeface taking its starting point in the above logo?

    but a good starting point. You could alter it to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    it? \r\n\r\nAnyway, I just checked in Firefox and everyone should be able to see
    it now. Hope you can help me out.\r\n\r\n"
