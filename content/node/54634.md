  found out the Lula typeface is a modificated Kursivschrift stehend from Linotype.\r\nI
  want to know more about it but can't find a lot of information (all I know is that
  it's german and it's based on cartographic lettering)\r\nIs there someone who knows
  something about this type, or where I can get information about it?"

    a while back. He had this to say:\r\n\r\n\"These used to be the fonts cartographers
    used. Left-leaning italic for rivers, etc. They used to be engraved, thus the
    look. Berthold used to credit them with the administration responsible for the
    standard, i.e. Bayerisches Landesvermessungsamt (Bavarian Office for Land Registry
    or something -- the state cartography office). They're really cool and i've been
    meaning to use them for years. I set maps with that stuff on a Diatype, back in
    the 60s (i know, i know...)\"\r\n"

    the typeface \"Kursivschrift stehend\" was used, e.g. in the word \"Pfarrkirche\"
    (below the town name \"Spiegelau\", which name was typeset in \"Karten-Augustea\",
    another typical \"map font\")."

    question, is there someone who knows more about  the designer(s) of this font?\r\nLinotype
    just says 'German Cartographic Design', but I can't get a lot of information about
    this \r\n\r\n"

  body: I believe the designer is unknown. Perhaps like DIN it was created by committee.
