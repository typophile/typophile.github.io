		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ben <BR>I like the idea of the Victorian type &ndash; it looks kind of like a tattoo &ndash;not sure if you were consciously trying for that, but it's an interesting direction. It seems like everything I see in magazines about hate groups, skinheads, etc. always has some version of distressed heavy manual typewriter type, so it's nice that you avoided that. <BR> <BR>I think the style of the type is good / appropriate but I feel like the type needs to be bolder and stronger &ndash; it seems a little too delicate / feminine now.  <BR> <BR>Since you already have a vaguely tattoo look happening, what about drawing the type by hand (in the same basic style) so that it's obviously hand-drawn?  <BR> <BR>I really like the swirly barbed wire &ndash; you have to look twice to figure out what it is&hellip; that's nice. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">BB: <BR> <BR>I think both the broad interlocking &quot;H's&quot; and the &quot;H's&quot; sharing a stem work really well. Both have potential to be very respectable designs for a universal design community (this is what you want, no?). If you go with a circumfrance of type, then be very articulate with the type selection and try to keep the type very small in relation to the icon/mark. It should appear as a thin solid ring, rather than a spacious airy circle of type. Add more verbage (i.e. descriptors, locations, dates, whatever), if necessary to fill the space. It's looking quite nice</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think your idea for an organization of designers against hate is a wonderful idea. However, this name for your organization is a terrible mistake. Let me explain why.  <BR> <BR>It shows a misunderstanding of the psychology of hate, and will be counter-productive. <BR> <BR>Psychologist Alfred Adler pointed out that the first step to anti-social behavior is to divide 'us' and 'them'. The next step is that 'they' are less than human and it is ok to hate them and use violence against them. <BR> <BR>Recently psychologist Steven Stosney - <a href="http://compassionpower.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://compassionpower.com">http://compassionpower.com</a></a> - who has been one of the most successful in treating wife beaters and road rage, has pointed out that compassion and anger are opposites - and anger is a key component of hatred. Hatred and the accompanying anger impair a person's thinking, so that they no longer think in terms of problem-solving, but only us vs them, and whether to attack, defend, or withdraw. Compassion motivates you to understand the other person and act appropriately. When you understand the other person you can act much more effectively, whether it is to cooperate or oppose them.  <BR> <BR>This is why 'hate the hate' is a terrible idea. It falls into the trap of perpetuating the stupidity that hate causes, instead of providing the understanding that leads to its cure. <BR> <BR>Ecclesiastes said there is a 'time for love and a time for hate', and I do think that hatred is functional physical self defence. It blocks the compassion that would make you hesitate to harm the other person, and as a resulkt you may be killed yourself. Aside from battle, I see no benefit in real hate. <BR> <BR>Hrant's views on this matter are in my opinion completely wrong, and would lead to a much worse world.  <BR> <BR>I think that your chances of being effective will be greatly if you contact and accept guidance from existing organizations fighting hate groups, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center - <a href="http://www.tolerance.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.tolerance.org/">http://www.tolerance.org/</a></a> - and the Anti-Defamation League - <a href="http://www.adl.org/adl.asp" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.adl.org/adl.asp">http://www.adl.org/adl.asp</a></a> . <BR> <BR>These have long experience in fighting hate groups, and have had notable successes. I am not saying you should simply be a wing of one of these, but you should certainly talk to them and get benefit of their experience before going forward.  <BR> <BR>By the way, note the logo for Tolerance.org - not great but not bad. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, apparently you have no idea what I'm saying (wow, that's a first). <BR> <BR>The trap is to make hate an Evil thing. It is human. By coming to grips with it, we can control it, and make those whose hate is out of control more human, like us. In this way of showing compassion to them, we have a better chance of converting them to a &quot;control mode&quot;. So basically you're saying: I hate the fact that you're like that, and that makes us the same - but I'm in control of myself - you can be too. <BR> <BR>Your view is entirely too orthodox and rigid, and is leading the world down this path of destruction we're seeing more of every day. Because it's religious, as opposed to pragmatic and human. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

(including me) IMHO you'd be better off just donating your time to groups similar to the ones mentioned by William. If you want to organize to help other designers do the same, you can do it without this approach. Maybe I feel this way because I'd be a little creeped out by joining an organization with a bonafide hate emblem. <BR> <BR>Plus, you will cut down on calls from klansmen looking for you to design insignias for their local chapter. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Your marks certainly do look real. Too real, I think. I see those and I think &quot;run!&quot; not, oh what's that text say? Designers against hate? <BR> <BR>I feel like this mark could benefit from some more exploration into what makes it look like a fascist/supremacist symbol. This is an identity, so I could see the current symbols interacting with more contemporary typography (as opposed to the expected circle badge). I think that this would more clearly portray the concept (as I understand it) and the body of people who will presumably fall in and support it. <BR> <BR>And support it they will, if it's done well. True hate is a terrible thing, and never ends well. People hating sin can be just as bad for humanity as people hating minorities. &quot;Hate the hate&quot; to me takes advantage of today's ironic culture. I say hate on a regular basis; &quot;I HATE it when they don't have Swiss cheese!&quot; I'm not deeply angered and full of animosity towards the sub shop. In this case I feel like it can be a great call to action. I don't see the purpose of this as attacking groups of people violently, but reaching people in a way that both says &quot;hating is not acceptable by your peers&quot; and also &quot;here's what we can do.&quot;  <BR> <BR>I think assuming off the cuff that Ben's hate group will be burning things and hunting people is a bit hasty. I support the notion. I support the design. Make sure it's accessible and shows its self honestly.  <BR>And good luck. <BR> <BR>Aaron <BR>&lt;/font&gt;</div>

(although we've had some past battles).  <BR> <BR>I do understand the mockery idea and how that could take away some power from real hate groups but it smells of Adbusters - which proves to accomplish little more then self-congratulatory behavior in a pretty package of half-wit. <BR> <BR>I honestly don't see that a group promoting hate to hate groups would solve anything - it would only provoke more hatred from those you attack - especially by copying their brand.  <BR> <BR>I could see how it might turn into a who's looking meaner, and more evil competition. - unless the group of designers have better plans? <BR> <BR>Perhaps you want to describe your business plan here. I think describing your planned actions will help everyone understand what the point is and then we can critique the logo to see if it suits. <BR> <BR>nice symbol though - the last one - if you were a devil worshiper looking for a hell sign</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Both anger and hatred are Godly qualities. <BR> <BR>Paul writes: For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. <BR> <BR>That is, he hates doing evil. <BR> <BR>And in Rev. 2: <BR>`Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <BR> <BR>God speaking to one of the 7 churches, commending them for their 'hatred' of wrongdoings. <BR> <BR>As for anger, Jesus was angry at the moneychangers he found in the temple. Rather than making it a house of prayer, it was turned into an arena for profit. <BR> <BR>As Hrant stated and as the Bible shows, it's a matter of how you deal with your hatred and anger. It is a righteous quality to hate what is evil. The key after that though, is to not take vengeance into your own hands, which is what most people do. Rather, &quot;be at peace with all men, as much as it is possible.&quot; <BR> <BR>Two other quick notes. Hatred of a person is not the same as hating what someone has done or does. Also, because most people deal incorrectly with their anger and hatred, it makes anger and hatred seem wrong. If the anger can be used to start something good, then that is the correct kind of anger. <BR> <BR>But with that said, the logo &amp;/or name itself seems too ironic for me.  I think a possible problem with a logo against something that it very closely associates with is the initial confusion, and even confusion after people find out what it means. It's smart to be able to find similarities with your opposition, but maybe this is too close? Ultimately, it's your call. However, it's not a logo I would be proud of displaying, if I were in the group, no matter how well it's aesthetically designed. It has lots of baggage that you probably won't be able to overcome. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR>&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">so we're comparing this organization to the actions of god?  <BR> <BR>If God and Paul had hate then we can congregate, advertise and propel some more?! With that example then you could say that Hitler followed a righteous path or any of the groups that hatethehate would target and it becomes a mute point. But somehow I don't think that's what the holy ones had in mind when its written that they &quot;hated&quot; - to become hate inc. and shower it on everyone you don't like hoping that they'd smarten up. For some reason I think that maybe god or paul had a bit more power to persuade. See, if I were a religious person and god just told me he hated something we were doing I would probably freak out and do what-ever he said. Will hatethehate have that power - nah. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wrote that hatred and anger is often misused, and Hitler would be an example of an unjust hatred, as well as hatred misused. <BR> <BR>I don't think the examples provided advocate spreading hate through a hate group. While it might be fine for something truly wrong to make you angry, having that anger and acting upon the anger negatively are two different things. But I do think it is possible to have a just anger and act correctly. In the case of hatethehate, the anger is just. I'm just not sure promoting more hatred is the best way to go.   <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is it not all down to a matter of opinion? <BR> <BR>&quot;Hitler would be an example of an unjust hatred&quot; <BR> <BR>In your opinion (and I'm sure many others), but in his own mind, I'm sure Hitler believed his hatred to be wholly justified, as did many of his followers. <BR> <BR>Just as, in a more contemporary arena, I'm certain many millions of the followers of Islam believe their hatred for America and Western values is justified. <BR> <BR>I don't think it's black and white, but equally, I don't think citing examples of 'just' hatred and 'unjust' hatred does anything to further the argument. As Tanya alludes to, it merely serves to highlight the similarities between people who hate &ndash; 'justly' or 'unjustly'. <BR> <BR>Jordan</div>

No other way around it - (maybe you can jump over Hate? I don't know for sure) inflicting Hatred will eventually conflict Hatred. <BR>Hate is a state of confusion, non-illuminating and muddled.  Hate Hates please and sorry and other nicities. Can Hate only happen by one's self? Or does it take a person such as Hitler?  I don't think so!

You may be leading us all into False Hates, with your emblems of Hate. <BR>The False Hates: <BR>Do not fool yourself into thinking you Hate when in fact your Hates are FALSE and just a reverse of the &quot;L&quot; word with no possibility of leading to the PAM.

You are fresh and wise! I sense you have much to teach us. If you have further questions please ask! For Hates knowledge is endless yet limiting. <BR> <BR>The following are quotes I have collected for the Hate leaflets: <BR>&gt; <BR>&quot;Hey, don't knock the self Hate. It's sexing the hate with someone I love!&quot;  <BR>&gt;Woody Allen  <BR> <BR>&quot;We often hate one thing and despise another, not telling the hateful truth even to the gods.&quot;  <BR>&gt;Maureen Stapleton <BR> <BR>&quot;Hate things as you would have them Hated instead of as they are hated.&quot;  <BR>&gt;Kenny Rodgers <BR> <BR>and finally&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Revelation # 7 <BR>Even if you do not feel Hate, the Hate feels you. <BR> <BR> <BR>Sincerely PoH#1 <BR> <BR></div>
