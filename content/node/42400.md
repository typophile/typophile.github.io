body: "So, I'm about to overhaul my business identity. The business, Microspective
  Multimedia, develops small-business identity (my largest draw is artists and complementary
  health practitioners), plus multifarious print, web, audio, and photo services.\r\n\r\nI'm
  tired of hearing, <cite>\"'Microsp... Mediawhat?' What a mouthful!\"</cite>, so
  I'm shortening the name simply to Microspective. Even though the \"multimedia\"
  descriptor has been omitted, I figured Google, Flickr, Amazon, etc. don't include
  their service in their name, so a simplification seemed in order.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I've found it difficult to be objective about redesigning my own business identity,
  so I'd like to solicit your knowledge and experience for opinions on kerning, proportion,
  and anything else that you find objectionable (or favorable) about this logo.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your comments!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRay\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/microspective-tc1_3994.png]"

  body: "\"Microspective\" is a cool word, and right now none of these seem to take
    advantage of its aural or visual qualities.  It has two i's, and a descender near
    the middle.   I'd like to see you play with that, instead of using a mark that
    refers to \"perspective\" but is otherwise meaningless.  I'd play with the letter
    ideas on paper before thinking about what font or color to use.\r\n\r\nGood luck!
    \ It's hard doing your own business identity - I've been taking almost a year
    to work on my own."

    do anything. If you want a simple wordmark consider something like this. Good

  body: "Hi microspective,\r\n\r\nI know, creating an identity for your own business
    is probably the hardest thing you could ever do. Like eeblet it has taken me more
    than a year now to develop one for my own design business - and I'm still not
    happy with it. However, your logo looks pretty perfect to me and it's hard for
    me to think of anything that could be further improved. I really like typeface
    you chose and the whole concept adds nicely to that. So I'd say go for it and
    don't think about it too much.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web Design Portfolio]]"

    he's the one who's actually finished his own business' branding, so you might
    want to listen to him.  :)

    to do that much with it. Right now, though the 'm.' mark is just a bit confusing.
    Why the period? Why is it cropped? Why is it rotated? In other words, it seems
    purely arbitrary."

  body: "The m reads almost more as an E or a B before I see the m. \r\n\r\n\"Microspective\"
    suggests to me attention to visual detail, precise focus. Could a logo reinforce
    those ideas?"

  body: Avoid forcing the viewer to figure out what you are intending. The mark you
    first presented makes no sense to me and I am a designer. Think about a potential
    client, ask, "Will they get it", right now I'd say no.

  body: "I'd focus less on illustrating the concept of \"microspective\" and more
    on illustrating your brand: if your strength is in attention to detail, pick or
    create beautiful letterforms, and make them perfect.  If your strength is on user-friendliness,
    pick a warm, friendly typeface and do something playful with the dots on the i's.
    \ Etc.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Actually, I like eeblet's idea with the descender near the middle. It may
    be interesting enough on its own to make a statement.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Rockport
    publishers also use this effect:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rockport-publishers-logo_6277.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    prefer the version without the boat though (which I was unable to find via Google).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web
