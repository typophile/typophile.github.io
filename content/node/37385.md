  one?\r\nOne can tap every letter and he showes you the window for except when using
  the spacebar.\r\nHow is one supposed to create the space in FontLab?\r\nSome things
  in FontLab are irritating to me. \r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "I would have done so, but there are no names above the glyph windows where
    there is yet no design made.\r\nSomething wrong with my preferences? Or the one
    of the font (opened it from a font file)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nI helped
    my self opening an empty font that he offers me and then pasted my glyphs in it.\r\nThen
    it works also with the spacebar. I find it strange nevertheless.\r\nGuess I am
    too much used to the simplicity of working with FontStudio..\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    that disturbes me or better to say I didn\u2019t find the right solution by now\r\nis
    that it is more complicated to go through the glyphs while designing (for making
    quick comparisons)\r\nby using the letters on the keyboard. The only way I found
    so far is with the Tabulator key opening the small board\r\nbut if one enters
    the glyph again for design one has to switch it off an on again to be able to
    use the keys again :-(( grr"

  body: "Yes I understand. Was no problem to name it and make it and place it anywhere
    I want but then I wasn\u2019t able to arrive at it for example in the metrics
    window. It didn\u2019t come out by using the spacebar That\u2019s all. Somewhere
    in the character there was then a space blanket yet without any control over it
    by key. Therefor senseless.\r\n\r\nStefan"
