  knew for sure. A few responses I received were:\r\n\r\n1] They are made by different
  type foundries but essentially the same. (As I recall they were designed by Erik
  Spiekermann?)\r\n\r\n2] Some are better used as body text and others for signage?\r\n\r\n3]
  Some are used as Light and Bold sets?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone out there help distinquish
  between them? Thank you."

    article by Yves on FontShop's FontFeed</a> should give you a headstart.\r\n\r\nLF
    stands for lining figures, or tabular figures, i.e. when you arrange them underneath
    each other in a table, they will line up. Don't know what LL means; Light Lining
    (figures)??"

  body: "Thanks for linking to that article, Vincent. That should clarify the MetaPlus
    vs. Meta.\r\n\r\nA correction: Lining and Tabular figures are not the same thing.
    [[Lining Figures]] actually means the numbers line up horizontally. You could
    call them \"all caps\" or \"titling\" figures. Lining figs can be proportionally
    spaced. TF stands for [[Tabular Figures]] which means they all have same width
    for tabluar setting.\r\n\r\nI have never heard of Meta LL."
