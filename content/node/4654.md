body: I&#39;ve been asked to design a logo in a Malayam lettering style. I&#39;m looking
  for a sampling of Malayam type styles to learn what liberties I might take with
  letterforms. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

  body: Hi Jim -- <BR> <BR>Kind of humorous that I&#39;m the first to respond, as
    I&#39;m the least likely to give you any good pointers. :^/ <BR> <BR>I googled
    with &#34;malayam &#43; lettering&#34; and didn&#39;t really find anything. But
    then I let google do the spelling and it came up with a variety of things. Google
    spells it Malayalam. Anyway it seemed to have some links that might be useful.

  body: Yes, Malayalam is the correct spelling. Note also that there are two different
    ways to write the Malayalam script -- traditional and reformed -- which I believe
    affects the way in which some letters combine.

  body: 'Thanks Tiffany and John and John. I did a google for malayalam newspapers
    and magazines and found a bunch of malayalam logos. Very helpful to know the name
    of the language, I must say. Also got some very good input from a language expert
    at agfa/monotype. I have what I need and I&#39;m ready to dive in. Thanks again. '
