body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nwe made a script for automatic font family naming in
  FontLab and I want to share with you.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMaybe some of you find
  it useful. We use it mostly for big families.\r\nIt\u2019s relative simple to use.
  Documentation is included.\r\n\r\nThis script changes the font names of all opened
  fonts for the use as font families. \r\n\r\nExample family:\r\nMy Family\r\n  \u2013
  Light\r\n  \u2013 Light Italic\r\n  \u2013 Regular\r\n  \u2013 Italic\r\n  \u2013
  Bold\r\n  \u2013 Bold Italic\r\n  \u2013 ExtraBold\r\n  \u2013 ExtraBold Italic\r\n\r\nThe
  naming method will also split up the family into single-font-families in the font
  menu in non-OT-savvy Windows applications.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on Karsten
  Luecke \u201CFont Naming, Scheme [B], Page 7/8, Version 1.02\u201D (See <a href=\"http://kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.shtml\">documentation
  at his website</a>) but with some important changes:\r\na) The script will style-link
  italic styles\r\nb) The use of \"Regular\" and \"Regular Italic\" in \"Font Family\"
  is now removed\r\n \r\n\r\nYou can download the script here at Cape Arcona: <a href=\"http://www.cape-arcona.com/news/capearcona/opentype-production/\">CA
  Font Fam\xADily Nam\xADing [B].py</a>\r\nNeedles to say that FontLab Studio 5.0.3
  or later and RoboFab is required.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: RoboFab is not required anymore!\r\nUPDATE:
  The script will style-link italic styles\r\nUPDATE [20 Oct 2010]: The use of \"Regular\"
  and \"Regular Italic\" in \"Font Family\" was removed \r\n\r\nHope you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas

    Version (on OS X) and it works for me... :-/\r\n\r\nHmm... at the moment, I\u2019m
    working on the same script WITHOUT the necessity of a RoboFab installation, to
    be more precise, Karsten Luecke worked on it. :-) But we need to test it first
    before I wanna release it. Give us one or two days for an update, please.\r\n\r\nThomas"

  body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nfinally the script is now updated and RoboFab is not
    necessary anymore. Sorry that it took so long.\r\nWe also added support for style-link
    italic styles to font families.\r\nThere is also an instruction PDF inside the
    zip that should explain everything.\r\nHopefully some of you find the script useful.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "If the font is the regular weight (book, normal and regular), the script
    neither should add the string Regular/Normal/Book to the Family name, nor to the
    Font name, nor to the Full name.\r\n\r\nHowever, thanks! I don\u2019t need it,
    because I know, how to name fonts, but nevertheless I like it, if people don\u2019t
    want to have money for each and everything.\r\n\r\nAnd 231 lines, from which 74
    are comment, is not long in my opinion. Or did I misunderstand you?"

  body: "I'm fine without the script, but if I used it, I'd sure like to be able to
    style-link bolds as well. At the very least to the regular weight, but preferably
    to any/all. Of course, that runs one into more limitations in typical Windows
    apps....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
