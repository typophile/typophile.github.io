  body: My local independent bookstore got one of those, and has used it to bring
    back a bunch of out-of-print books on local history. Pretty cool.

    so the buyer could select a page size, font, and font size at will.\r\nAny requests
    for \"A Brief History of Time\" in Comic Sans?"

    years ago (maybe more than that!). You could choose from a list of books, and
    they would print one for you while you watched the machines do their thing.\r\n\r\nI
    asked for a copy of <em>Flatland</em>, but it was a scan of a very old edition,
    with a Microsoft logo at the bottom of every page (because Microsoft was involved
    with a project to scan books in the public domain)!"

  body: "The only downside that the book is printed with toner and not with the less
    reflective ink of book presses. I recently bought a book from amazon that was
    printed on demand. It was printed with ink not toner, but the scan was somewhere
    around the neighborhood of only 300-400dpi. More readable than the pdf on my screen
    of course, but janky nonetheless. If this machine uses pdfs with embedded fonts
    or 1200 dpi scans, I imagine customers will be happy. There should be a warning
    if the file you're printing from is less than 600 dpi. \r\n\r\nAlso, their home
    page has a new video for a \"2.0\" version: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDe_Jy4HnMY\r\n\r\nThere
    are also other photos on the web of models in use, such as here:\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6205386/Google-Espresso-promises-on-demand-book-printing.html\r\n\r\nThe
    machine is ugly and not friendly at all, unlike those trashy but easy photo kiosks.
    There needs to be a counter/shelf under the keyboard (I'm looking at the telegraph
    article) for people to put their backpack/pocketbook and coffee on. Otherwise
    you feel like a tool standing in front of that thing. \r\n"

    customers will be happy.\r\n\r\nThe way I read it, the system will use whatever
    is available. Many out-of-print books exist only as scans, often at 200 or 300
    dpi, due to the size of a raster-based book file.\r\n\r\nI suspect that quality
    will vary widely. But if the book is something that has been out-of-print for
    30 years, and you really want it, 200 dpi is better than nothing."
