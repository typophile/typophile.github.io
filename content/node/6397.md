body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for the fonts seen here. These are from official
  White House stationary. The Vice President typeface is from the early 1980&#39;s.  <BR>
  <BR>If not the exact name of these typefaces &#40;they&#39;re probably original?&#41;

    Semibold</a>, but isn&#39;t quite. &#40;The &#34;W&#34; proportions are off, and
    the letters aren&#39;t quite the right width.&#41; Maybe it&#39;s a custom Plantin?  <BR>
    <BR>P.S. The &#34;W&#34; from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-oldstyle-205/engravers-old-style-205-bold/testdrive.html">Cochin</a>
    comes close to this one.'

    The mayhem has already started but the military &#40;oops&#41; police say they
    have it in control. No terrorists here, nope, no way, I hope
