    worth it.

  body: "Florian,\r\n\r\nI don't think it looks like Mendoza at all.\r\n\r\nLook at
    the capital M, which in Mendoza has less of an angle from its base to its top,
    while in the sample it is much closer to a 90 degree angle. I doubt if this occurs
    more in Mendoza's bolder weight than in the MAN RAY sample above.\r\n\r\nLook
    at the very top of the capital A in Mendoza, which has a distictive cut out, which
    is missing in the bland MAN RAY sample.\r\n\r\nThese are two strong supporting
    proofs that the MAN RAY sample is not set in Mendoza.\r\n\r\nBut thank you for
    turning me onto Mendoza, which has some nice design attributes."

    i'm sorry to be off topic but does this happen on this board only or does firefox
    not display cmyk at all."

    and the top of the A is not the same as the sample. Would they have customized
