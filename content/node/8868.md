  body: That&#39;s strange, I was able to view it in CMYK. <BR> <BR>In regard to my
    color related comments, I like the color I am seeing now in RGB better than what
    I saw in CMYK. The CMYK looked too dark, but this RGB looks more orangy than brown.
    Which is more accurate? I would suggest going with the lighter, more lively color,
    or if you do go darker, go with a richer color, as in rich soil &#40;more red
    than yellow&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: What is the name of the company? &#39;zerosion&#39; or &#39;z-erosion&#39;.
    If it&#39;s the former, then I&#39;d suggest making &#39;Zero&#39; all black.
    If it&#39;s the latter, it looks good, though it seems to emphasize &#39;erosion&#39;
    rather than the lack of it.

  body: 'Good point Darrel.  Thats something I&#39;ve been considering. The name of
    the company is Zerosion not Z-erosion.  Here are my thoughts and concern about
    the possibilities: <BR> <BR>Zerosion: Are people going to pronounce it correctly?  I&#39;ve
    heard someone say something like zerahscion. <BR> <BR>Z-erosion: This empahasizes
    &#34;erosion&#34; too much for sure.  I thought a compromise might be to leave
    out the dash and just change the color &#40;like my posts above&#41; <BR> <BR>Zerosion:
    with &#34;Zero&#34; in one color and &#34;sion&#34; in the other.  Here &#34;Zero&#34;
    reads well, but what does &#34;sion&#34; mean?  And again, will it be pronounced
    correctly?  <BR> <BR>Later this evening I&#39;ll post the different possibilities
    and let you guys be the judge. I&#39;ll also work on the tagline and colors.'

  body: Is this your name, or was it provided by the professor? I remember these projects
    in school...they&#39;d give you an odd company name and you&#39;d have to design
    a logo around it. One of ours was dietrim &#40;diet trim? die trim?&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I can appreciate the challenge, but in hindsight, these were bigger branding
    issues than merely a logo...they realy needed a renaming. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyways,
    I digress. <BR> <BR>Looking at the mark, you explicitly say &#39;zero erosion&#39;
    below it. So I&#39;m thinking that perhaps you just make the entire word one color.
    Maybe even lowercase the Z to de-emphasize &#39;erosion&#39;.

  body: Scott- I changed the small text, Impact, to Arial Black Regular. I also changed
    the tagline &#34;Zero Erosion&#34; to &#34;Retaining Wall Systems.&#34; The color
    is more accurate in RGB.  <BR> <BR>Darrel- The name &#34;Zerosion&#34; is one
    I came up with.  Our professor gave us the word &#34;zero&#34; and we were supposed
    to come up with a company &#40;by the way, I graduated May 2003 - just trying
    to brush up my work for my portfolio&#41;. I created a lowercase option and a
    couple color options. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63963.jpg"

  body: I like your new descriptor a lot better. I didn&#39;t think the title needed
    to explain itself in a tagline. The small type looks nicer, but you&#39;d have
    to be willing to lose it on small applications

  body: I&#39;m really liking the one-color versions. And, now that I see it, I think
    it looks fine &#40;if not better&#41;  capitalized. You might be able to increase
    the size of the tagline, but I imagine that would mainly depend on the particular
    application.

  body: Ty, unless your fitious client spends a ton of money on promoting its name
    &#40;IBM&#41; make the new tagline a lot larger. This is a communication suggestion
    not a design suggestion. I&#39;d suggest removing the letterspacing on the tagline
    and make it 1 1/2 times as long as Zerosion

  body: 'One of the problems with this project &#40;as with most student projects&#41;
    is that it doesn&#39;t have enough limitations.  In the real world &#40;like where
    I currently work&#41;, clients impose limitations that make creative design challenging.
    <BR> <BR>Would anyone be interested in imposing some limitations? Become the imaginary

  body: The thing with retaining walls is that it&#39;s largely a commodity product.
    As a consumer, I simply shopped around for the cheapest block of concrete that
    I felt looked OK. The logo &#40;or even brand&#41; had little to nothing to do
    with my decision. <BR> <BR>Granted, I&#39;m guessing their primary target would
    be other contractors. As such, you&#39;d want to pitch the benefits of the product
    at them. &#39;erosion control&#39; unfortunately, is a defacto feature of any
    retaining wall system, so that&#39;s not terribly unique.  <BR> <BR>Since this
    is a student project, I&#39;d suggest doing the opposite. Come up with a nice
    logo that you like &#40;I like this one&#41;, and then design the project brief
    around that to fit your particular solution. ;o&#41;
