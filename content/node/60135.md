  vs any other licensed media such as graphics, music or video?</li>\r\n<li>[How are
  type designers different] than the creator of images on a webpage, or sound, or

    fee), a designer will license and use it.\r\n\r\nIf there are enough designers
    who value the fonts you provide enough to use them (as in, the value they add

    are paying for your fonts, you can charge 10 dollars each.\r\n\r\nBut if only

    other countries, with perhaps a lower piracy rate, where lots of companies spend
    a lot of time and money on branding and image, they do take IP seriously.  And
    they have the money and are willing to spend it to get IP they want.\r\n\r\nAnd
    IMHO, piracy for web fonts could easily be less than it is for computer fonts,
    just because they will be public.  These fonts are not aimed at being used on
    internal wikis.  They are for creating a more compelling public web site for customers
    to see.  Foundries can readily find out if a web site is using one of their fonts.
    \ With computer fonts, it's much harder (or impossible) for a foundry to tell
    that a given company is using their fonts for all their correspondence, because
    where they are being used is internal-only, or just to clients (or even in printed
    matter).\r\n\r\nLots of companies (in the US at least) will do the right thing
    (either stop using the font or pay to license it) if notified they shouldn't be
    using it.\r\n\r\nSimply put, for a business that sells IP of any kind, a strategy
    of aiming your sales strategy at people who have money and are willing to part
    with it in exchange for the IP works much better than trying to shoot arrows into

    in special web font 'players' or via plug-ins, and most of the browser makers
    will not implement a format that contains technical measures to protect software
    that require enforcement on the part of the browser. What some of us are advocating
    is a format that a) is appropriate to the web medium (which means a format including
    compression) and b) contains bulkhead protections against casual and unintentional
    unlicensed use. The difference between the bulkheads and the kind of technical
    measure that would enable DRM -- the kind of measure that automatically invokes

  body: "Thanks John, for that clarification. \r\n\r\nI think that the DRM vs free
    dichotomy that many keep asserting in these threads is really a false dichotomy.
    There are more options than either trying to make it impossible to steal a font,
    or to make it free. Two things can I think and hope create a sustainable market
    for web fonts: 1. Making it not easy and obvious to download the font for non-browser
    use without piracy software; and 2. Enforcing large, public violations of EULAs.
    \r\n\r\nBecause fonts are tools for publishing either on the web or print, and
    because publishing is by definition public--and the web especially public--the
    situation is significantly different from the story with music. Font vendors are
    not going to even attempt to go after the individual consumer, which was the issue
    with downloading music. But they will go after publishers. \r\n\r\nAnd I think
    large foundries such as Monotype, Adobe, will be willing to sue owners of web
    sites who do considerable business for violating EULAs for web fonts. And once
    the principle is established, my guess is that web businesses will be extremely
    reluctant to do stuff in public that makes them subject to a hefty law suit, when
    there is a relatively low cost to getting the font.\r\n\r\nSo I think that while
    significant control of piracy among say scrap-bookers may be impossible, it does
    seem possible to have enough enforcement leverage on web publishers to create
    a remunerative market for web fonts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To the original post, \r\n\r\n>Why must type be protected?\r\n\r\nType, must
    not be protected, ever. Fonts must be protectable though. Seeing this from the
    user perspective, it is not entirely totally the opposite of other media, but
    close.\r\n\r\n>Why do you believe fonts are \u201Cspecial\u201D for the web [...]
    vs any other licensed media such as graphics, music or video?\r\n\r\nType must
    be protected. (just kidding). Fonts, not so much special, are different because
    the operating system's treat them differently.\r\n\r\n>[How are type designers
    different] than the creator of images on a webpage, or sound, or text?\r\n\r\nWe're
    all human, beyond that what's the question?\r\n\r\nKent, I think the panel gave
    entirely the wrong idea of compression. David or someone jumped raw and naked
    at Bill or someone when they implied that compression is a bad thing and nobody
    stopped him, nobody. Then David said, compression is not a bad thing... but well,
    if you don't have to compress a font, that's a good thing isn't it? Compression
    in this instance particularly sucks because digital outline fonts are so friggin
    compressed, you couldn't fit a credit card in there. What's more, there is danger
    in font compression that makes, e.g. your connection speed issue trivial. So,
    maybe compression is a separate and slowly cooling issue ;). Subsetting, now that
    should be a hot issue!\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I might have bit on panel-wise,
    and maybe other people thought of it too, was when the user asked from the audience
    what would happen if, (though it's more likely <em>when</em>), their @font-face
    call doesn't work: the panel agreeing unanimously for a change, that the backup
    font would be there, probably like Verdana... But what if text is replacing a
    graphic of text, like everybody says they are trying to with @f-f? Can web developers
    write code to, \"Either display this font, or if you can't, tell me, and I'll
    tell you to display this graphic instead?\" It might be trivial, but then it is
    the web we're talking about so my guess is that there are going to be at least
    some size differences to cope with, getting from a bunch of scaleable letters
    back to a block of pixels of text... I mean no one wants their logo e.g. to default
    to Verdana or anything else, do they? \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    commonly used is a lossless form of compression, JPEG is a lossy form which results
    in dramatic compression ratios.  All the font compression techniques discussed
    are lossless (gzip, lzma, MTX) so the question is how much better does a given
    compression method improve compression ratios versus already available methods
    (i.e. HTTP gzip compression).\r\n\r\nAs David Berlow suggests, a \"lossy\" form
    of compression like subsetting is where substantial gains are to be made in reducing
    the size of fonts served.  This doesn't require a new font format, it requires
    new tools that do this accurately without quality loss.  Typekit is effectively
    providing a tool like this, a tool used to create a custom font for each user
    of their service."

  body: "Remember, we're just trying to get a simple web font format which offers
    some protection. EOT Lite offers that. Any number of other proposed formats would
    be adequate as well. The persistent use of the simplistic and inflammatory term
    \"DRM\" is really not helpful to the discussion. EOT Lite offers enough protection
    for many foundries and has nothing even vaguely resembling DRM in it.\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing to consider: The DVD format offers relatively mild copy protection,
    and it did rather well. You could say that there was a small but vocal opposition
    to it being there, but by and large the average customer didn't even notice. It
    worked, and the format was one of the most successful new technologies in history.
    You might call that apples and oranges, but it's an example of an industry having
    enough protection to be comfortable putting its digital content out in the world
    without causing any particular inconvenience to customers.\r\n\r\nAdobe does have
    reason to expect that recent and future versions of IE would support CFF fonts
    in EOT. Possibly older versions as well, with a little help from Microsoft. With
    the compression inherent in CFF, the compression issue becomes less urgent.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, subsetting can be pretty handy."
