  my mind was if these two were simply not complimentary, and that's why they were

    the sideways option first, it is also needed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by the \"relations
    with the mark\" ? The hands currently form a check mark, which is something that
    I'd like to have in a logo. Also with hands pointing down it acquires a subtle
    \"things looking down\" feel to it, so I wouldn't flip it."

    the use of such an example \u2014 but perhaps something more like [[http://www.buzzsystem.com/wax_seal_widescreen.jpg|The

  body: I agree that it looks like it wants to be clean but is just slightly off.
    If it's supposed to be an irregular wax seal, I think it needs to be more irregular.
    But then, maybe the type (and all the rest) would look too clean next to it. I
    was thinking more along the lines of the Golden Seal that Penn linked to above.

  body: "Regarding to your <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/63410\">previous thread</a>
    I am wondering whether a more 'digital' logo would improve the identity or not.\r\n\r\nI
    'googled' the word 'timestamping' because I could not make any sense of it and
    found out that a typical timestamp looks like this:\r\n\r\n<cite>2005-10-30 T
    10:45 UTC\r\n2007-11-09 T 11:20 UTC \r\nSat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005\r\n1256953732</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    is this criptical way of documenting the logging events that makes me think about
    seperating the 'cert' and 'time' by insertig a colon. Maybe not only inserting
    a colon but form one by customizing the t's.\r\n\r\nBasically I am doubting the
    use of the good old classic clock. Allthough the symbol communicates 'time' and
    'stamp' it seems a little too playful for me and as far as I understood timestamping
    -- I could be totally wrong -- it's all about documenting logging events in a
    very effective way (displaying time like 'hh:mm' instead of displaying it by using
    a classic clock.\r\n\r\nNevertheless this is just my opinion and as mentioned
    above, I don't really now what timestamping is all about."

  body: "All of the posts on this thread are timestamped. It's nothing complicated,
    just a date+time with many possibilities for how it displays.\r\n\r\nI think the
    question is more about aesthetics than branding. My feeling is that a web-centric
    logo should -- if at all possible -- be horizontal and uni-level. And for tech,
    I feel that its \"breathability\" should be as medium as possible.\r\n\r\nYour
    latest iteration is too light. I would recommend making the clock and the textmark
    about the same height, with the textmark just a little bit shorter than the clock.
    And then have the textmark about 2/3 to 3/4 of the weight of the clock (imagine
    1/1 as an extremely bold font). You want the two sides of the font to tag team,
    but still be distinct.\r\n\r\nAlso, as an alternative to the current style of
    clock, you might consider a more distinct and well-definted polygonal shape. The
    current clock is indistinct and amorphous. Consider hexagon, octagon, bolt shapes,
    etc. Just make it an interesting shape with a circle in the middle. And instead
    of two equal-width, straight hands, have two distinct hands and then a more upright/angular
    checkmark if possible (but as a secondary bonus)."

  body: "Stephan, thanks for the opinion. The symbol is actually meant to refer to
    time, wax seal and a check mark (indicating things being authentic) at the same
    time. I tried but I cannot simplify it any further. I personally do not see it
    as playful. If there is one thing I am concerned about is for it not to look like
    a clipart.\r\n\r\nCustomized Ts - yep, they are customized to use single sided
    T crossbars in all versions except for the last one.\r\n\r\nEric, I agree that
    the horizontal layout works better. With regards to the shape of the clock and
    hands - amorphous is the wax seal (stamp) reference, and the hands <em>are</em>
    tapered, though obviously not enough to be noteceable. I tapered them further
    in newer versions, thanks."
