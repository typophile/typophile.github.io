  face is used in the closing credits, with a heavier weight used for most of them,
  but a lighter weight used here for 'THE END'.\r\n\r\nYou can see the whole film
  on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQqzeiTYDo, with this still from
  1:58:00. If you don't know it, it is a very strange and rather wonderful film in
  parts and well worth watching."

    transferred direct from a font.\r\nLooks like a version of the widely used Trajan
    column letters.\r\nUpdate\r\nThe _E_ is wider than usual for a classical Trajan.\r\nI
    agree that the letters have a Tuscan flavor with the bifurcated ends, but off
    hand I don't recall a Tuscan that is an exact match.\r\nIn these letters the bifurcated
    terminals are very restrained compared to the digital fonts that I have seen.\r\nDon"

    many years after the move -- in 1991-- by Richard Lipton \"based on Lipton\u2019s

    the weight is too heavy but it has some of the flavor of the lettering.\r\nDon"

    think of any other similarly windblown serif fonts?\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Don,\r\n\r\nIt'd exactly the subtlety of the terminals that I rather
    like.\r\n\r\nArrus is an interesting one. \r\n\r\nFrom what I can remember there
    is another heavier variation and (a rather unpleasent) one with a slightly celtic
    feel, but I think this is the only text in this lighter variation. \r\n"

  body: "Pedr, Arrus is part way there. But to get these letters  you really have
    to create them from scratch. Arrus is good in that it gives some idea of how to
    make some of the terminals. Draw on this and the windswept top terminals from
    Artcraft and it is possible to create something similar. Fair amount of work.
    \r\nI think I saw the move many years ago and enjoyed it. Good stuff without Hollywood
    mega funding. Look forward to when I can see it.\r\nDon"
