  It was of little interest until I saw step 14. So I applied that technique to type.
  I thought I would share those results with you.\r\nIllustrator - Blend tool (w).\r\nThis
  tool makes complicated tasks extremely easy. The possibilities are endless. Enjoy.\r\n[[http://thesupermarket.us/youarewhatyoueat/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/superblend1.jpg|here's

    "way cool" feature in AI88 (version 2). Of course, back then it would have taken
    20 minutes for the blend you built to process on my old Mac SE. '
