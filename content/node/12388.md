body: The craft of mechanically setting type for printed reproduction. Formerly an
  arduous task occupying much of the professional typographers' time, typesetting
  is increasingly subsumed into the larger task of [[graphic design]], and is rarely
  seen as a separate activity now that the [[Monotype]], the [[Linotype]], and phototype
  machines are seen as dinosaurs.
