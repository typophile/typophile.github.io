body: '[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SWA_6479.gif.gif] This was likely created
  in MS Word or Powerpoint, & I can''t tell if the "SWA" is a different font than
  "Consulting" - but, any help determining which font/fonts are in the logo would
  be greatly appreciated!!'

  body: Hi Erin and welcome to Typophile. The typeface used for consulting reminds
    me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/|Optima]] and SWA could be
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/korinna/|ITC Korinna]].
