body: "I\u2019m doing a stylistic set (ss01) where there will be a unicase substitution
  on the lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this:\r\n\r\nsub b by B;\r\nsub
  c by C;\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSo it will jsut change most of the characters to Uppercase
  letters.\r\n\r\nHowever on the letters I\u2019m changing glyphs, I don\u2019t know
  exactly if it\u2019s OK to do like this:\r\n\r\nsub a by a.unicase;\r\nCould I have
  any name as I wish on the unicase glyphs after the period. I can\u2019t go for a.alt,
  since it\u2019s already taken.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, aaaaall the way from Sweden."

    but I have named glyphs similarly in some fonts and I find that it works ok.  \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nMagnus"

  body: "[[Adam Twardoch]]'s suggestion is that the suffixes follow the 4-letter feature
    tag, so a.salt for the stylistic alternates feature, a.swsh for the swash feature,
    etc. Following this scheme, the appropriate suffix for unicase alternates within
    a 'unic' feature would be a.unic. However, if you are, as you said, putting it
    in a stylistic set, you may opt instead for a.ss01 instead. For a full listing
    of OpenType Layout tags, follow this link: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm\r\n\r\nHaving
    said all this, it doesn't really matter what suffix you use.* However, i'm <em>guessing</em>
    that the reason Adam suggests as he does is that future versions of FontLab <em>may</em>
    incorporate this naming scheme as part of automatic OT scripting. In any case,
    i agree that using these suffices is the most logical method to follow (except
    in instances of say multiple forms for the same feature, perhaps Adam has suggestions
    for this sitution as well?)\r\n\r\n*within reason and with some technical limitations."

  body: Paul, thanks for that. I agree it make sense following some guidelines, even
    though you could name as you wish.
