body: "Shmuel Guttman was one of the last generation's great designers. His genius
  was not expressed in innovating new designs, or creating contemporary versions of
  ancient designs. Rather, his contribution as a great artist was in the minor modifications
  of small details of popular designs of others which he created.\r\n\r\nFor example,
  when Odetta sang a song written by Bob Dylan, her talent as a singer, and her creative
  interpretation of the song, expresses her genius. The song remains written by Bob
  Dylan, but her creativity exudes from her version of song.\r\n\r\nLet us look at
  some \"minor modifications of small details of popular designs of others which Guttman
  created\"."
