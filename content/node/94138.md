body: "I suspect I might only receive help for the main body text here. The numbers
  to the right were moving scores. I am not sure if they were even a font. The numbers
  to the left (in the second picture only) were static but might be the same font
  as the main body. If I can find out what all three are then I will be so delighted!\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1959score.png\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1959score2.png\r\n\r\nThese
  examples are from the year 1959, a show in France. I am not sure if that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance for your help. If you need some more samples of this font do
  let me know.\r\n\r\nIs the font available online? Can I read about it and its designer
  anywhere?"

  body: p.s. How do you mean "standard font"?

  body: "Standard in the sense of a generic type of \u2014 in this case \u2014 sans
    serif. You may notice that a lot of fonts have similarities in certain glyphs,
    especially numbers. Hence my description..."

  body: "The typeface appears to be a condensed version of Aldus (designed by Hermann
    Zapf, 1954), a very close cousin, or a hand-drawn variation of a similar Venetian-inspired
    typeface.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a serif on the crossbars of the F and E, as well
    as the configuration of the serifs on the S, G, and C, appear to be a good match."
