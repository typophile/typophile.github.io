  like Friz Quadrata (font used for Law & Order), but I can't find a version that's
  as thin as this logo. Plus there are slight variations that would make it seem like
  Friz is not the exact one.\r\n\r\nI realize there is a chance that it's a custom
  font.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-dividend_capital_5582.gif]"
