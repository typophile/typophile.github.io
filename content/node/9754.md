  body: It was done by hand, look at how the S&#39;s match. <BR> <BR>In general there
    are so many handwriting fonts out there that it&#39;s often faster to do your
    type by hand than to spend hours trying to match a font.

  body: Once again, it looks like it is a font &#40;although the sample is too small
    to be sure&#41;, because the m&#39;s look identical.  <BR> <BR>However, as with
    all hand-printed fonts, I think there is a large chance it is a custom font, because
    they are so easy and cheap to make. Virtually anyone who can print with a pen
    can have one made, for less than $10. &#40;This ought to be part of the FAQ&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>If this is a hand-printed font I have collected for the Script Font ID
    Guide, it would be in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part
    11</a>.  If you do not see the exact match, you may note some that are close enough
    if you would prefer to have a font, rather than make the lettering by hand. <BR>
    <BR>I will look, and get back if I find it, but you might also want to look, in
    case it is not among the approx. 500 fonts in this part of the Guide.

  body: I have finished looking at Part 11 in the Script Guide and also the handwritten
    MyFonts samples. I found no exact matches. <BR> <BR>Since you are looking for
    free fonts, the 2 closest free ones I saw in the Guide were <a href="http://www.pixilate.com/fonts/"
    target="_blank">Onder Bold</a> from Pixilate.com and <a href="http://www.fontparadise.com/fonts.asp?type=alpha&amp;id=J"
    target="_blank">j.d.</a> from Emerald City Fontwerks
