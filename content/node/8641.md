    <BR>As far as I remember there is a free 30-days-trial period. <BR> <BR>And of

  body: 'FontLister lets you view all of your fonts, edit the sample text that each
    font is displayed in, get a close up of the font&#39;s character sets etc. <BR>Its
    quick and easy to use. <BR> <BR>Version 2 is free from: <BR><a href="http://www.theill.com/fl/download.asp"
    target="_blank">http://www.theill.com/fl/download.asp</a> <BR> <BR>Version 3 is
    free to download, but $5 to use for more than 30 days - it doesn&#39;t stop working
    or become limited in features after 30 days, which is even more reason to cough
    up the miniscule fee! <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;ve had version 3 for ages, and thought
    it was freeware until I went to the Help screen to get the details for this post,
    so I&#39;m just off to pay for it now&#41;. <BR> <BR>Software for the cost of
    a pint and a packet of crisps - you just have to support it really.'

  body: I just noticed that the same website also has a freeware program called FontSelector,
    which lets you browse and print all your <b>installed</b> fonts. &#40;FontLister
    gives more info and works with any fonts on the system, installed or not&#41;.
