  all group up in the font menu.\r\nsay i had a family name\r\nXXX regular\r\nXXX
  Bold\r\nXXX Heavy\r\n\r\nAnd i want them all to be\r\nPFxxx Regular\r\nPFxxx Bold\r\nPFxxx
  Heavy and so on.\r\n\r\ni am not talking about a utility that renames the ttf file
  such as the family name but actualy changing at once the font internal name\r\n1.
  family name\r\n2. sub family name\r\n3 full name"

    the TTF format from microsoft documentation but could'n get it to work properly.
    and could not find source code on the net. \r\n\r\nIf i could get my hand on two
    basic functions somthing like\r\nProcedure ReadFontName (var FontName,FullName

    would be able to manipulate these functions axactly to my needs;"

  body: "At what point did you get stuck on writing your own program?\r\n\r\nAll of
    those strings are in the 'name' table -- one of the easier tables, although there
    are two layers to each string (encoding and language).\r\n\r\nAfter changing something
    in this (or any) table, you have to recalculate the checksum of that table alone
    and of the entire file; the exact procedure is outlined in MS's documentation,
    with sample code in C.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, perhaps it's easier to use <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\"><strong>TTX</strong></a>:
    expand font to XML, change strings, recompile into font."

  body: "That's exactly what I was about to suggest. TTX can do lossless round-tripping
    of TTF/OTF, though it works best if one goes through the pain of installing version
    1.3 (due to compatibility with latest version of OS/2 table).\r\n\r\nNote also
    that the name table can have multiple versions of any given name string. One usually
    has both Mac and Windows versions for almost every nameID, and occasionally one
    sees different versions for different languages.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "to recompile the font i can sinmly open each font in fontlab and do the same.\r\n\r\nin
    ttf format things seem simpler to code, but the same procedure on otf generates
    a font that wooun't install.\r\n\r\nI managed to write code that reads the font
    info correctly, But when trying to write back somthing goes worng.\r\n\r\nI use
    methodes of direct win API to read write the file (delphiws read/write dose not
    seem to work the same, may be it deals with handles diffrently but cold not understanf
    why, binary data should be binary data, no???, (BlockRead, BlockWrite works better,
    but still with direct API functions i get less errors, WEIRD)).\r\n\r\nmaybe somthing
    gows wrong with the CheckSum, I doln't know, but i am not managing to fully understand
    the TTF\\OTF file format.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought that the differnce of TTF vs OTF
    is only Records and enteries after the end of the file (of the TTF) but seems
    that OTF have Some differnt headers\r\n\r\nmaybe 16\\32 bit variabls - Byte ->
    DoubleByte ||| Word -> LongWord.\r\n\r\n\r\nTTX:\r\nI cound never get the FontForge
    To work on my computer properly, (I use Phontographer 5 & FontLab 5)+ I don't
    know python (I should get in to it sometime soon i guess).\r\n\r\nhowever font-format
    is not common knowledge."

  body: 'TTX is great and well suited to the kind of thing you want to do. You might
    also look at DTL''s OTMaster, which has similar capabilities, but with a graphical

    editor. Here''s a link: http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/OTMaster_rdrct.html'

  body: "No, TTX does require Python. It does not, however, require FontForge. Now,
    on OS X Python is usually pre-installed, so that may be a no-op.\r\n\r\nOne big
    reason to use TTX is that it is lossless. Decompiling with FontLab and exporting
    a font out is not lossless.\r\n\r\nWriting your own apps to do this is really
    quite complicated. I know somebody who thought fonts were simple data structures
    and surely he could write an app to do what he wanted (similar kinds of manipulations,
    mostly to the name table). After spending about 20-40 hours of looking into it
    he realized that I was quite correct, and it wasn't worth writing an app from
    scratch.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
