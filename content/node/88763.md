  and \u2018S\u2019 during my research work for a \u201CTrussardi\u201D brandmark
  [<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Image_TRUSAD.gif\" target=\"Bilder\">Image_TRUSAD</a>].
  The beautiful picture showing Natalia Vodianova shot by the Italian rooted photographer
  Paolo Roversi inspires me for various reasons. First there was the tender inclination
  of her body in this photo counterbalanced by the way she holds her hands. I tried
  to keep the lines in the back of my mind that her body draws [<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Image_g.gif\"
  target=\"Bilder\">Image_<em>g</em></a>] and to add to my character something of
  the great sensibility that this extraordinary photographer puts in his opera. It\u2019s
  the kind of \u201Cbreakability\u201D that attracts me a lot. For the influences
  coming from the world of typefaces itself I think here is to quote beautiful <em>Dante</em>
  by Giovanni Mardersteig."
