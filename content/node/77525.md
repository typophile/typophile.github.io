  body: Yeah, I'm going to retract my suggestion and go with riccard's - it definitely
    looks like Planeta.

  body: It probably is Planeta, but it looked so familiar, I thought it was something
    more well-known and older. Looking a bit more, the closest I could come is Neuzeit
    Grotesk, which still isn't as close a match as Planeta. Nor does Textbook New
    have the distinctive lowercase "t".
