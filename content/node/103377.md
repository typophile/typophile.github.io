body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nHere I am to present you this Riviera, my first attempt
  to design a font. The project started in the late 2005, when I hand-designed some
  capital letters to present a project.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg1_6705.jpg]\r\nNow
  I'd like to complete it. In my mind it should be a display font inspired and recalling
  the modern movement, '50 etc. Until now I designed a to z lower and uppercase. Numbers
  are just sketched, I need some time to fix the thicknessess; punctuation and glyphs
  are not yet drafted. Maybe in future I'll develope different weights versions, but
  now I want to define this medium weight one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg2_4401.jpg]\r\nHere
  there is a little test page:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg3_3623.jpg]\r\nI
  know there are some problems. /S/ is quite ugly, although /s/ satisfies me more
  but not at all; /r/ is not so good, the cut seems sharp; and many more things that
  probably now I can't see. Expecially I'd like to ask you an opinion about the general
  rythm and the relation between letter width. I think there's something that doesn't
  work but I can't understand what.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\nBest regards\r\nStefano\r\n\r\nPdf
  is attached to take a closer look"

  body: "I took a close look and i really like the shapes. Especially the K\u2019s
    are beautiful. So i started to wonder what thicknesses you where referring to.
    IMO the thicknesses are fine.\r\n\r\nTrying to write about potential to improve
    i would say:\r\nThe /g\u2019s and /e\u2019s lower curve may be a bit to small
    for my taste but as a monitor font it will certainly work well i think. The optical
    baseline is a bit bumpy because there are no down-/upstrokes on /u /r ect.\r\n\r\ni
    hope this helps\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice. On balance, I wonder if the lowercase t/f and /j might not be wide
    enough? I agree with 37DMK on the loop an the bottom of the /g.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    why the uppercase /W doesn't match the lc /w or the /V ? ...In fact, it looks
    like you flopped the /M for this one....\r\n\r\nLooking good, keep it up! :-)"
