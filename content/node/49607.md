    and if so are looking for suggestions on how best to go about it, or are you looking
    for someone to do it for you?\r\n\r\nJH"

    a graphic designer in you local area.  Furthermore, unless you know someone who's
    willing to do it as a favour, you going to have to pay them.  This pretty much
    goes for most people on this forum I guess, as this is what a lot of us do for
    a living.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "no problem, as long as you let people know what you need.  I think logos
    1 & 3 should be able to be done by most Graphic designers in the digital realm
    without too much fuss.  Logo 2, I'd say your best course of action would be to
    get someone to draw your version from scratch, then get it digitized, so that
    it can be manipulated to any size, without any loss of quality.\r\n\r\nJH"
