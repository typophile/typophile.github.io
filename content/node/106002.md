body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a logo design for an italian food blog
  that has to communicate a sense of professionalism and elegance .\r\nAfter a series
  of drafts this is what I ended up with. The typefaces I used are a classical italian
  Bembo and a more sleek and modern Avenir for the more serious text \"Addiction\".
  I am in a position where I think I can kind of see the potential in the idea, but
  something is still off, something needs to be improved in order to make the logo
  shine. \r\nI need some third eye points of view from the persons of the community,
  so any feedback/comments about it will be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  the attention "

  body: "Indeed your logo gives an air of professionalism and elegance. I like very
    much the Bembo for 'Italian' word, but when I read 'addiction' is like NOW something
    wrong is happening. It directs me to a law firm... Of course, addiction by its
    meaning is not a positive word, but I would see it as an image, literally an image,
    which would convey that you 'stick' to it, cannot get rid of it. Therefore, sans
    serif, for me at least, is not giving this notion to the word. I tried to make
    'Italian\" sans serif and 'addiction' serif, but I didn't like it. Somehow, you
    have to emphasize the notion of 'addiction'. I was thinking of a typeface that
    would look like being engraved in stone, which would highlight its strong power,
    'of being addicted to something'. It would say: now I am engraved in stone, try
    to get rid of me... :) \r\nIn the image below I used fonts which I had (Trajan
    Pro), sorry for that! :( But the middle points are quite roman and in some way
    emphasize word's strength, especially when you try to read it. It makes you stop
    between the points. It is just a way of seeing it, not something that I propose.
    Maybe, the image will lead you to find some new techniques for your logo.\r\nHave
    you tried making \"Italian\" calligraphic, without using any fonts, make it by
    yourself, an elegant script and \"addiction\" in lowercase, serif maybe? \r\nAnd
    by the way, I used a line because you used one. It may be not necessary. But is
    not bad at all too. \r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test1_4846.png]\r\n\r\n______\r\nWill
    you share with me how to make an attachment instead of inserting the image? It
    saves space on the screen. Thanks!"

  body: '"Addiction" is a strong word that implies compulsion, strong emotion, etc.
    Your treatment is too precise and controlled. You might try putting "addiction"
    in a totally different font than "Italian", perhaps a script that looks strong
    and energetic.'
