    your fonts have relatively small glyph sets, e.g. just Latin 1, then it may be
    viable. You do need to adjust the settings on a per-design basis, but if working
    with a large collection what I would probably do is try to group them based on
    similarity of proportions and basic spacing, then do tests to establish settings
    for each group, run the groups through KernMaster, then test individual fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    have noticed that if a font is 'cast small', i.e. the outlines are short relative
    to the em square, KernMaster doesn't do a good job. In those cases, you can scale
    up the outlines, run through Kernmaster, then scale down the kerning and apply
    to the original outlines."

    version of FM Light 2.7.0</a> I made for Mac OS X. I have built an installer for
    Intel Macs running Mac OS 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7, which installs <em>FM Light 2.7.0</em>
    for Windows directly in the applications folder. As mentioned, the stuff is \u2018Wine\u2019-wrapped,
    which means that one does not have to install any additional software, or to start
    up the X Windows System \uFB01rst. Besides a few minor issues, which I described
    in the <em>Read Me</em> \uFB01le, the wrapped version seems to run pretty stable
    and fast. The only downside of the wrapping is the hefty 330 MB, which is used
    by the application on the hard disk.\r\nAs a bonus, the included DTL TraceMaster
    version is <strong>fully</strong> functional.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KeMa_1_6021.jpg]\r\nJohn:
    <em>\u2018If your fonts have relatively small glyph sets, e.g. just Latin 1, then
    it may be viable.\u2019</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nActually I think that KernMaster also
    works \uFB01ne for Cyrillic and Greek, but the new <em>KM 2012</em> version allows
    right to left and vertical kerning too. To get the preferred outcomes, probably
    some tweaking is inevitable; there seems to be always room for discussion about
    kerning values. The new version will allow different \u2018kern strengths\u2019
    for different (groups of) pairs in one \uFB01le. \r\nKM has always worked pretty
    good for the DTL fonts and, like almost everything else in the font production,
    I think that the kerning generation should be controlled via parametrization and
    that the outcomes should be completely reproducible.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KM_2012_1_6237.jpg]\r\nThe
    \u2018old\u2019 KernMaster was tailored for a FM-based font production, hence
    it only works with BE and IK \uFB01les. The new version works directly with OpenType
    fonts also, and it is very much features-\uFB01le oriented. The resulting kerning
    can be merged with the original OpenType font data directly. Besides kerning also
    spacing can be generated, like in Kernus 3.0. Although high on my priority list,
    the current beta version of KM 2012 is not capable of batch-handling font \uFB01les
    (yet).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KM_2012_2_3497.jpg]\r\nFEB"

    [\u2026]</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWe checked our customer database and the version
    you purchased is from late 2006. At that moment CoMa was basically in its \uFB01nal
    stage of development, so if you recall what did not work properly or as expected
    still, I would very much appreciate it if you could let me know, either on this
    forum or directly.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u2018<em> [\u2026] 32.5 non-stop eight-hour days
    of nothing but kerning.</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThat sounds like real fun to me!
    I reckon you work (mostly) with FLS. For the \u2018old\u2019 KM you would need
    a Character Layout \uFB01le (.cha) then, which connects glyph names to positions
    in a (temporary) BE glyph database. I reckon that the simplest way to ensure that
    one\u2019s naming convention is correctly used, is to convert the FontLab .nam
    \uFB01le that one is normally using. The .cha \uFB01le is needed then for the
    conversion from a font to BE format and, of course, for generating the kerning
    data. Secondly, a kerning \uFB01le is needed, either with or without a kern class
    \uFB01le. Then the kerning can be generated in batch and the output options are
    .afm or kern feature \uFB01les. The resulting kerning can subsequently be merged
    with the original FLS font data. \r\nBecause the import of fonts can be done in
    batch (for instance using the FM <em>Light</em> modules) and the generation of
    the kerning \uFB01les can be done in batch too, the conversion and kerning generation
    can be done quite fast. Another option would be the use of Karsten\u2019s plugin
    for KM. If you want to test KM, I can send you a full version for this purpose.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJohn:
    \u2018<em>[\u2026] an issue I found recently with KM (2.6.0) is that it was applying
    different kerning [\u2026]</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe examples you give have
    actually always been a small issue with the algorithm. The fact that something
    is sticking out can result in a deviation, which is normally (always) <strong>very</strong>
    small. Also minor rounding errors can show up, because of the fact that the actual
    calculation is done in the IK format on a \uFB01ner grid. For relatively small
    \u2018plain\u2019 kerning \uFB01les the deviations are not really a problem and
    basically they can be ignored, but for larger ones the use of kern classes should
    be the solution in my opinion (we are looking for a way to convert these back
    to \u2018plain\u2019 \uFB01les, if necessary). If one uses kerning classes in
    KM, the \uFB01rst character in the class is used to calculate the kern value.
    But from your post I understand that this did not work for you?\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB"

  body: "I didn't try kern classes within KM. What I did was to generate a .krn based
    on broad groups in FontLab, using Karsten's scripts, and ran this with the deliberate
    intention of getting a very large set of kern pairs that I could then compress
    to class kerning back in FontLab. My reason for doing it this way is that my glyph
    set is very large with lots of oddly shaped glyphs, and I wanted to hit as many
    legitimate exceptions to class kerning as possible. But because of the algorithm
    issue you describe, I ended up with almost all exception kerning, and relatively
    few pairs that compressed to class kerning. Karsten's import script has an option
    to compress within tolerances, but I found that I couldn't rely on that since
    some legitimate exceptions were within the same tolerances as those resulting
    from the algorithm problem.\r\n\r\nI think the way to fix this must be some way

    if I see any mis-estimations along the way, I simply type and tab to the end of
    the string, then continue tabbing to the trouble spot.\r\n\r\nIn my experience,
    using this method makes the work go a lot faster, plus seeing that all of the
    values end in five or zero fairly conclusively confirms that the font was hand-kerned.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Maybe a few additional notes:*\r\n\r\n1. & 2. & 5. are indeed related. KM
    does exactly what you ask it for: check whether predefined pairs need kerning
    or not. If a pair is not covered in .krn, with glyphs identified by glyph names
    as defined in .cha, then the pair will not be considered for a check.\r\nYou could
    use previous designs to determine which pair are to be checked and possibly kerned.
    Plug In KernMaster has a script \"Extract KRN From Font\" which helps collecting
    kerning pairs from existing fonts which is described in the manual. (This is based
    on the assumption that designers reuse kerning test strings and as a consequence
    kern about the same pairs again and again.)\r\nYou could generate a .krn file
    once, analysing a couple of your fonts, or at least similar ones, and use it for
    future fonts. This implies, of course, that you have a certain standard glyph
    set.\r\n\r\n3. When using KM, I generated three or four sets of kerning, right
    one after another, each time with slightly different strength settings. (Export
    KM input files once and then duplicate them.) Then you can compare results side
    by side and choose one.\r\n\r\n4. KM does special tricks with punctuation marks
    which one may or may not like. I didn't, and in an updated version of Plug In
    KernMaster did another trick to prevent KM from recognizing punctuation marks
    as punctuation marks. I will upload the new version next week (need to update
    the manual a bit too).\r\nAnother thing is that you may need to apply different
    strengths to letter-letter vs letter-punctuation pairs. If you do, you need to
    make sure that one .krn file only covers inter-letter kerning pairs, and another
    .krn file only letter-punctuation kerning pairs. It's a bit of work to set these
    up, but once prepared, these .krn files are reusable for all your fonts.\r\n\r\n*

  body: "Karsten,\r\n\r\nFirst off, hats off for providing a simple and very useful
    tool: the value of the .cha file your plug-in has is easily illustrated by a snapshot
    of my first attempt at KM at 200% kerning strength, using the .cha and .krn files
    available with the program\u2026\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.nicksfonts.com/depot/popcafe_kerno.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter
    I substituted your plug-in .cha file and my own .kern file, the results were more
    in line with expectations.\r\n\r\nOne other anomaly I noted was inconsistent kerning
    values for straight-side glyphs in the above font: the kern-left values for H
    I K L M N were different by as much as 10%. I'm also using KM's default .cla files;
    it occurred to me that these discrepancies might be overcome by exporting shape
    classes, but it appears that the structure of FontLab's native .flc files and
    the KM .cla files are different. If beggars can be choosers, the option to export
    shape classes might be a welcome addition to your plug-in.\r\n\r\nAs far as the
    punctuation problem goes, it has been evident even at 200% kern strength, so the
    separate-file workaround wouldn't necessarily produce different results.\r\n\r\nFrank,\r\n\r\nOne
    thing conspicuously missing from the current version of KM is the option to discard
    kerning value below a certain threshold, such as -10. In most of the cases I have
    encountered, there is little appreciable difference between -6 and no kerning
    at all. It would be handy to reject these minor quibbles automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and my own .kern \uFB01le, the results were more in line with expectations.</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAssuming
    that it is syntaxly correct, technically a Character Layout \uFB01le can only
    in\uFB02uence the process by either or not corresponding with the positioning
    of the glyphs in the database and with the kern \uFB01le. If the .cha and kern
    \uFB01les that come with KM not fully comply with the naming convention you use,
    by de\uFB01nition any other \uFB01les that are directly based on your font data
    will work better. For that reason the new KM 2012 offers the option to export
    both .cha and kern \uFB01les from the selected OpenType font.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough
    not implemented yet, for a long time it is on my wish list to indicate the kern
    strenght in the kern \uFB01le itself in case this has to differ from the default,
    i.e. overall value. This will be implemented in KM 2012. In the old KM the maximum
    kern strength is limited to 200%, but in the new version this is basically unlimited.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u2018<em>I'm
    also using KM's default .cla \uFB01les [\u2026] it appears that the structure
    of FontLab's native .\uFB02c \uFB01les and the KM .cla \uFB01les are different.</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
    kern.cla \uFB01le which comes with KM is very limited and its content is actually
    only meant as an example. It is especially included because for generating kerning
    pairs it is mandatory to have a kern.cla \uFB01le selected in KM, whether it is
    used or not. For the production of .afm \uFB01les it is actually ignored, but
    it is used for the generation of kern.fea \uFB01les if glyph class pairs are used.
    The .cla \uFB01les use the AFDKO syntax. If you use glyph class pairs in your
    kern \uFB01le(s) always be sure that these are all de\uFB01ned in your .cla \uFB01le.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u2018<em>[\u2026]
    as the punctuation problem goes, it has been evident even at 200% kern strength
    [\u2026]</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIf the outcome does not match one\u2019s expectations,
    it is possible to use a script to correct the generated kerning in a certain direction.
    As soon as a deviating pattern is recognized, corrections can be made directly
    (in batch) in the generated .afm or .fea \uFB01le (which, by the way, can also
    be optically/manually edited in BM), of course. After all, a kern strength of
    200% means twice the amount of kerning generated with a 100% setting. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nI
    use quite some scripts to control the stuff, if only because the generated kerning
    for a complete BE (or IK) database (West, East, Turkish, Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese,
    etc.) has to be renamed (and distributed) for single byte fonts (for instance
    oldstyle \uFB01gures to \uFB01gures and small caps to lower case). Nowadays I
    use AppleScript in combination with BBEdit, but I used VBA with Word in the past.
    The nice thing of the combination KM with BM is that the generated kerning \uFB01les
    can be directly connected to the glyph databases for the actual font generation
    (batch). No additional action is needed.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u2018<em>the option to
    discard kerning value below a certain threshold [\u2026]</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis
    is implemented in KM 2012 already. Rounding is not (yet) part of the application,
    but it should not be too dif\uFB01cult to write a script for this. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB"

    L M N. Because your source font contains the respective kerning class, I K L M
    N would be kerned 'automatically' (and identical to H) because they are included

    kern feature: a) pair kerning and b) class definitions. KM \u2013 speaking of

    need adjustment to produce tighter or looser kerning. I then run Kernmaster on

    <em>KM&nbsp;2012</em> for Snow Leopard and Lion. It would for instance be interesting
    to compare the output with that of the just announced <em>TypeFacet Autokern</em>
    (or any other application for kerning), and to show some results on this forum.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    pleased to hear that you're working on a software's update (by the way, I bought
    the full version of DTL OTMaster in August of 2011: how much will it cost to upgrade
    to the new version?).\r\nI would really like to try the latest beta version of
    KM 2012: I will send an e-mail to your address.\r\nThanks for everything!\r\n\r\nFrancesco"

    but I have no clue how to use it and I can't figure it out. Is there anybody out
    there with some experience testing it?\r\nMy attempts only get some changes in
    few already existing kerning pairs (5) but I can't get new ones added.\r\n\r\nTIA.
    \r\n\r\nR."
