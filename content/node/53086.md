  audience: m/f, 18-30 yrs old, electronic music lovers.\r\n\r\nI\xB4m looking for
  the best font, which I will use for the logo and most of the motives.\r\n\r\nIt
  has to be young, contemporary, plain and striking (and maybe a little bit aggressive
  due to the \"Riot\").\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help!\r\n"
