  the main categories and styles of type and discuss where they come from in a historical
  context and why and where their use is relevant to contemporary designers.\r\n\r\nCould
  you please direct me, hopefully somewhere on the web that will address this short
  and sweet. How am I going to make this entertaining is my question as well.\r\n\r\nAs
  well, does anyone know of a site that demonstrates in some way how to pronounce
  typefaces and type founders names.\r\n\r\nThanks"
