body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've been working on my font [[http://www.typophile.com/node/55891|Mint]]
  and my company is interested in licensing a beta version of it for the logo, so
  only a small subset of the glyphs will be used. My company is paying a design agency
  to create the whole logo including graphics and text. If we ask the agency to use
  Mint, I have two questions.\r\n\r\n1   Am I licensing the font to the agency or
  to my company? Should I charge?\r\n\r\n2   What sort of licence would be best? I
  haven't written one before so I just want something very quick and easy. I want
  them to use it <strong>only for this logo</strong> as the font is still being tweaked
  and is not yet released. I guess I can write any kind of licence I want?\r\n\r\nAll
  advice gratefully welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks :)"

    you're under contract they may already have certain rights around work you do,
    even if you do it in your own time. So I would be inclined to not play hardball
    with them. Why not provide the logo outlined? That might avoid all the complicated
    licensing effort.  "

  body: Ah, no, my company is only my day job, this wouldn't be remotely covered by
    work. But I could convert to outlines perhaps.

  body: "Looks like we have decided to go with Bryant (ah well, sure I'll be able
    to use Mint for something soon). The agency thought that was the best for the
    job so I'm going with their judgment. I think also it will be more useable since
    there are four weights that can be used for supporting documents. Mint is not
    at that stage of readiness yet. \r\n\r\nSo now I'm using Bryant for titles and
    stuff, can anyone recommend a companion body face for it? Currently I'm using
    Minion which doesn't quite look right. I'll have to have a dig around but if anyone
    has paired it with a serif before I'd love to hear which."

  body: Oh, the serif face needs to have small caps, italic and bold, and be suitable
    for extended reading. Something a bit more unique than Minion (though I do like
    it) and perhaps slightly funky would be interesting too.
