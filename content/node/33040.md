  I'm very much a neophyte at type ID. Please help me ID the font at the top of this
  distressingly bad website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.knowledgeboxcentral.com/\r\n\r\nLooking
  for the font in the lovely \"Knowledge Box Central\" animated GIF. Can anyone help?
  I need to find this particular font in the next five minutes for a rush job my employer
  just threw in my lap.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
