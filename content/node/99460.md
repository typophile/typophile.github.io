  company i'm working for. The logo includes a little bit of text. Now i/we need to
  edit this logo, but i don't know the name of the font. Nobody in this company knows,
  cause the old designer is not very cooperative and dosn't want to help anything.
  So nobody knows this font. Maybe you can give me an hint, what it can be. I attached
  the logo to this post. If it dosn't work, you can see the logo at the head-area
  on http://www.missingscout.com.\r\n\r\nI would be so happy, if u can help me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-missingscout-personensuche_4045.jpg]"

    in your head or is there a tool to compare fonts?"

    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\">WhatTheFont!</a>\r\n\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/identify.html\">Identifont</a>\r\n\u2013
    <a href=\"http://www.whatfontis.com\">What Font Is</a>\r\n\r\nAll three fail to
    identify Colaborate based on your sample (WhatTheFont! had to because MyFonts
    doesn\u2019t carry this typeface), so probably Renko just knew."
