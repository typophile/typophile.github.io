  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I think the balance between typeface crits and &quot;composition&quot; crits has lately become very lopsided in favor of the latter. I remember the trend starting shortly before TypeCon04, and since then there was a short burst of typeface crits, but now it's pretty meek. You could say we're being shown fewer fonts worth critiquing lately, but surely it's a mutual thing; when obviously good designs are virtually ignored by almost all Typophilers, people are clealy less likely to show good stuff - there's probably more loss than gain since you're getting some measly crits in return for exposing your baby prematurely. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Even though it's only positive that Typophile can serve as a forum for composition crits, I think it's fair to say that there are much more people who make compositions than type, and much more people who seem to feel confident engaging in composition critique than type critique. Furthermor, we all have variously limited time to devote to Typophile in the first place, and this means if somebod spends 2 hours critiquing compositions instead of 1 hour, that's 1 hour less to devote to type crits. All this means we have to make en effort to preserve our invaluable ecosystem, where type crits are vital. We can't just build a city with no regard to the environment, otherwise our community won't last in <i>any</i> form. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>To me Typophile owes a large part of its prominence to being a singular hub of quality type crits. Now it seems there's a danger that the majority voice of composition will drown out the vital niche minority. So I would simply urge people to balance their time here so that the blood that feeds the whole of typography doesn't become depleted. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Chris, for your appreciative words. <BR> <BR>It is notable that experienced type designers, with the noted exception of Hrant, rarely enter the typeface sections to critique, and when they do, they offer a few words of encouragement or a point, and then go. <BR> <BR>Now I understand this better. For the past two years I have been entering the critique board, first with elaborate apologies, now less so, with the idea that critiquing and getting feedback from the designer and other critiques of the face would sharpen my own eye. It has indeed been a valuable education, for which I am grateful to Typophile - including Hrant!  <BR> <BR>At this point, I see that to give a full and proper critique of a face at this stage of my knowledge is going to be very difficult. I now know enough to be able to do a better job, but it would be so much work that I would be foolish not to put in the time on my own work instead (both as a writer and designer). Maybe when I am at a later stage I can critique thoroughly at a glance. But I'm not there yet by a long shot. And if ever I get there, I can imagine that I will feel like I should get paid for my time, given the time and effort I will have put in to get to that point.  <BR> <BR>If more experienced type designers would join in more often, it would be great. But I do understand better where they are coming from now. The boards are still a valuable training and testing ground in any case. And it would be nice if the more experienced designers dropped in more often. But for the reasons I have given, I don't expect it to happen.  <BR> <BR>That being said, a great pleasure of entering the boards is to see wonderful new talents entering the field, and creating excitment with their work. So thanks to all the posters!</div>

For example it doesn't take me long (like 2 minutes) to look at a PDF and point out that the vertical proportions, color and spacing are imbalanced and recommend a correction direction. It might take me another five if I want to get into specific glyph issue. Or if I see an overall ideological problem I'll just state that and probably avoid going into moot details. I wouldn't consider any of this &quot;thorough&quot; but I do consider it helpful (assuming I know what I'm talking about, for which I'll never have proof however). And not that I'm remotely at his level, but how much time does Carter spend on each font during type crits at Typecon? Five, maybe ten minutes. Is <i>that</i> a useless exercise? <BR> <BR>That said, I also don't expect to see many experienced type designers suddenly contribute free time here (although some, like John H, kindly do). But that doesn't make everything OK, and I have to say that I attribute that in part to a lack of grace. Helping your fellow human is a good thing - it's really that simple for me. It can't fix everything, but it's still a good thing. <BR> <BR>&quot;I hold every man a debtor to his profession, from the which, <BR>as men do of course seek to receive countenance and profit, <BR>so ought they of duty to endeavor themselves by way of <BR>ammends to be a help and an ornament thereunto.&quot; <BR>-Lord Bacon <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree, Hrant, that it is in large part a question of personality, although perhaps not in the way that you mean. I simply find it very hard to give typeface design critiques in writing. But I find it very easy to give personal, one-on-one critiques, and am always happy to do so if time permits. I lost track of how many student typeface designs I critiqued sitting on the stairs at ATypI in Prague. But I find the critique section of Typophile quite overwhelming, so have never more than dipped in my toe. <BR> <BR>Excellent Bacon quote.</div>

Pointing a problem and explaining why it doesn't work take 2 mn in real life, when it can take 20 mn in virtual life. From my own experience, its frustrating on booth sides. <BR> <BR>And this apply including with people you know well, work you have seen by the past in real and already critiqued. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, I get the feeling that people who do critics please themselves showing to others, by the number of post, length of them, they are the best in this world. Like looking on a mirror? I just try to say that doing type critics is not for ourselves ego but for others. <BR> <BR>Last but not least, most of earlier problems are generally the sames in many cases, its just basics skills, and reading some old critics can do better job than asking again and again. A web forum, a chat, an email discussion never remplace a proper exchange between people in real life, from what you can found in schools to in type foundries (small or large), sadly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is, as JFP says, no substitute for a face-to-face critique.  In the best of all possible worlds I would certainly prefer this to any virtual critique.  The problem is that we are scattered throughout the world and many of us do not have ready access to other people with type design expertise. The option then becomes virtual critique or none. <BR>I would be very honored to have one-on-one critique of my work by a renowned designer such as J.F. Porchez.  I realize that this is not possible not only because I am thousands of miles away but I would not be so presumptuous as to ask him for his valuable time.  I do feel that presenting my work online in the Typophile critique area is a way of asking, those of my peers who may choose to, for a critique without putting anyone in the uncomfortable position of having to say no. <BR>Mr. Porchez's comment, &quot;. . .most of earlier problems are generally the sames in many cases, its just basics skills, and reading some old critics can do better job than asking again and again&quot; is a point well taken for the accomplished type designer but for those of us who are new to the profession, it is ALL new.  I think there is room for peer review even if they do no more than point the person to an existing link or previous critique. <BR>Many of us work in a vacuum and the solitary nature of the work sometimes makes us want to cry out to the type community just to know others are having the same struggle. Perhaps we are just seeking to cast our bread on the waters and let whatever fish nibble if they are so inclined. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly there are huge advantages to doing a crit in person, not least the simple issue of &quot;interface&quot;: it's much more efficient to point at something and speak, rather than draw corrections on the computer and type stuff up. But a Typophile crit has its own advantages. Besides the obvious removal of the geographic barrier, there's the fact that it's public; this makes the education &quot;massively parallel&quot; - I know I've learned a lot from reading other people's crits. Also, sometimes a public crit spawns a fruitful discussion of how best to do something, which can't happen with only two people (with a one-way relationship to boot). When Randy puts up (or I should say used to put up) those nice illustrations, everybody benefits. <BR> <BR>BTW, I won't deny that there are also selfish reasons to do crits, at least in my case: I learn a lot myself just from the process and the formalization; and yes, I do get exposure, hence sales and commissions - but I don't expect to be looked down upon for that by people who do type design for a living! :-) As for the &quot;ego&quot; angle, I think it might be true sometimes, but it's really not very relevant if the results are useful to others - and since a steady stream of people tell me so I have little reason to doubt it. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
