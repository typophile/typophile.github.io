    in this one. To me the tail on the Journal a seems a bit longer than the sample.
    My pick is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/esquire-sh/|Esquire]]
    from Scangraphic, based on a C. H. Griffith typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Century 731]] is their version of the same typeface. I think either the Scangraphic
