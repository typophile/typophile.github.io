    accurately describing your question. Please fix this.

    'Stencil'\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_SNCQ-10012000_6034.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom
    the Adobe site: <cite> Two typefaces called Stencil were released in 1937 within
    a month of each other; this one was designed by Gerry Powell for American Type
    Founders. The characters are designed to emulate the look of bold, cut-out stencil
    letters. Use this typeface to command attention on signage, and for special effects.

    to see you're on the job. These things need to be addressed, but can you word
    it with a bit more compassion? I'd try something like this: \"Hi Phil, welcome
    to typophile. If you could post a sample or two of the fonts you're interested
    in that will help us solve the mystery. Also if you can refactor your thread title
    to make it more descriptive you'll get more responses. Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nSomething
    like that. How are things going anyway Eben?\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    typefaces.

  body: Keep in mind that "STD" is simply an (unfortunate) abbreviation for "OpenType
    Standard" and it typically means an OpenType font without added or advanced features,
    though this definition varies by foundry.
