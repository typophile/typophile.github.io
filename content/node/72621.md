  of typefaces, from different foundries and sellers etc. I've basically have fonts
  in all MAC osX compatible  formats (PS type 1, Mac TrueType, PC Truetype, OpenType
  (both OTF and TTF). Some fonts came in several formats. Can anyone tell me about
  the benifits and problems of the different formats, when it is best to work with
  which formats, etc.? I guess Opentype is the preferred choice nowadays (because
  of compatibility, character sets and extra goodies), but truetype and postscript
  are still widely used and a lot of type is still sold as PS or TTF.\r\n\r\nIf for
  instance I would like to use a typeface for a print project, and I have the choice
  between TTF and Postscript, which would you prefer and why?"

    TTF files are <em>not</em> usable under Windows (modern ones should be, and all
    Windows TTFs are usable on Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nMac Type 1 fonts contain the same
    data, but have a different encoding than Windows Type 1 fonts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    older font files make heavy use of pre-OSX's \"Resource Forks\", which makes them
    all but invisible to Windows systems.\r\n\r\nThe OTF font file format has been
    designed to overcome all of these problems, and most (if not all) 'modern' TTFs
    are, in fact, fully qualified OTFs as well.\r\n\r\n(That said: I think you need
    some rather advanced software to tell Good from Bad fonts on your hard disk. And
    don't use Ugly fonts at all.)"
