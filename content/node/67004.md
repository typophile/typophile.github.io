  body: "It's called Kurrentschrift or Deutsche Schrift, in English I've seen it called
    German Blackletter Script too. Do not call this S\xFCtterlin. Many people do,
    but strictly speaking, S\xFCtterlin is but one variant of this type of script,
    basically a less-elegant, monoline upright version that was used in schoolbooks
    (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nWe've
    had a bunch of Kurrent stuff recently (which is a good thing \u2013 I'm always
    surprised that it is so little known internationally). There was this wonderful
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/65337\">handwritten cookbook</a> that Hanno
    posted to Typophile; my Flickr page has <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157622929372055/\">a
    few spreads from an old Swiss schoolbook featuring both Fraktur & Kurrentschrift</a>
    (not S\xFCtterlin), and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4184236243/\">a
    sign painter's version of the Kurrent alphabet</a> from a 1930s lettering manual.
    Some additional discussion and links in those Flickr threads."

    looks like Kurrent but is readable to contemporary eyes. However for Voluta samples
    from the 17th and 18th century were used as reference. \u201DEine deutsche Kindergeschichte\u201C
    looks like 19th or early 20th century."
