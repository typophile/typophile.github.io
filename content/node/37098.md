    think it\u2019s a custom design."

  body: "If this is the same typeface at the \xBBfirst\xAB(?) or original (?) version,
    I'd say it is a custom work done by Gabriel da Abreu from Swith Design (South
    Africa). See J\xFCrgen Sieberts <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/files/wm_2010_logo.html\">Fontblog-topic
    \u201DThat\u2018s the WC Logo from 2010\xAB</a> (sorry, germanspeakers only).
    \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/page0_blog_entry324_1_3530.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I think Neuland is an excellent suggestion for a substitute, as always. The Neuland-typeface-concept
    is also known as Nueland or Phosphor and maybe more I don't know of."

    that is quite similar. From the same era as the original Neuland too.\r\n\r\n-
