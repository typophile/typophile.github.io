<p><strong>[ Please view the image before reading more, so you can get a <em>clean</em> first impression ]</strong></p>
<p>It is going to be called &ldquo;La Brújula&rdquo;, which in spanish means compass; and is meant to represent the one artifact pointing a desired direction, the intention of going that specific somewhere, as well as an existing architectural &ldquo;spot&rdquo; in the college called that way (were students wait between classes, read, talk, get together, etc).</p>
<!--break-->
<p>It is meant to be a young but still institutional publication (will be writen and design by students only), showing the variety of characters in students and the collage &rsquo;s will to be in constant change, for the good. It was created so students start to feel more like a community.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we&rsquo;ll be using Afga Rotis &ldquo;family&rdquo; for the publication (Serif, Semi-Serif, Semi-Sans &amp; Sans-Serif, with their variations), so I started from the semi-serif. There is a version for small sizes, in which &ldquo;La&rdquo; is bolder; just an idea.</p>
<p>Critics, comments, suggestions: All welcome.</p>

<p>To me, a compass is signified by an arrow pointing north. I see you&rsquo;ve got an arrow in there, but it&rsquo;s pointing west.</p>
<p>Does the spot on campus called La Brújula have some sort of recognizable landmark that could be worked into the logo?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi lex,</p>
<p>Well, the spot on the campus is actually a compass, made out of bricks rising about 30-40 cms as a flat circled surface of a 2-2.5m diameter, having a compass drawn (incrusted metal of some sort) on its top. I&rsquo;ll try to get a picture soon.</p>
<p>I see what you mean about the arrow. We were trying to make it more typographic rather than analogical (didn&rsquo;t wanted to show an actual compass), we only intended to show direction (notice oneway serifs), but the fact that it is &ldquo;pointing&rdquo; west I haven&rsquo;t realized.</p>
<p>Right now I can&rsquo;t think of something to solve that, is it too bad, what do you think? Suggestions? We previously tried something with the descendant of the J; Ill post it with the pic of the campus' spot.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>This are some photographs of the spot in the campus, they aren&rsquo;t so good, sorry for that; Im not that of a photographer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>gabssnake, the header is really looking good. But i think you need some minor modifications. May be you can wait for the feedback from other typophilies..here are my thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>. 1
The counter space between B,r and u is too wide..and because of this the over all header is looking weaker at this part.
. 2
The centre horizontal bar..which is coming out from the &lsquo;-B&rsquo; is not going with the serifs of the typeface and not even looking visually good(According to me)
. 3
The triangular thing(between B and r)is really looking bad&hellip;may be bacause its separate from both the letters. You can Identify the B without that also.
. 4 
Why the both U&rsquo;s are different from each other?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just my thoughts&hellip;wait for real comments from the other senior members.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>satya,
Thank you very much for your comments, I&rsquo;ll try to answer them as good as I can.</p>
<p>I now see the uneven space there between the &ldquo;bru&rdquo;, specially the &ldquo;ru&rdquo; pairs. I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to do about it, I can&rsquo;t close it more beacause of the serif in the U. Maybe I could separate everything a little bit to make it look more consistent, but I&rsquo;m worried about losing solidness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be trying a different &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; for the B, stay close so you can further comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try a version without the black form, I only left it because I thought it would loss some recognition.</p>
<p>I took the serif out of the first U because it was looking too &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; whith the acute accent. I&rsquo;ll post the previous version for you guys to see. By the way, is this looking odd? Most people don&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>I tried to work around some of the suggestions, also added some things I&rsquo;ve promissed.</p>
<p>0 - The first one I posted
a - The variation of the B&rsquo;s arrow
b - Arrow not pointing west ;)</p>
<p>All revisions: 1) added a ligature on &ldquo;RU&rdquo; pair, 2) discard the black form left from the circle, 3) same Us: added a serif to the first one.</p>
<p>a1 - just added the revisions.
a2 - modified R serif to try to match B
a3 - R with no serif
ab1 - both arrows implemented
b1 - no arrow on the B
b2 - a variaton of b1, contaning a rombus in the B</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments already, I&rsquo;m still working on this.

<p>It will also looks nice if you dont have that arrow at the bottom of the &lsquo;j&rsquo;..like in a3.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a thought - I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, so I don&rsquo;t know if this will work.</p>
<p>What if you took the shape of the compass arrow from your photograph (the circle with the diamond shape) and used it instead of the accent on the &lsquo;ú&rsquo;? It would probably work best if pointed straight up, but if that won&rsquo;t read properly in Spanish, try angling it to the right. You probably won&rsquo;t need any other arrow shapes in this case, so base it off of version b1, with the &lsquo;j&rsquo; from version a.</p>
<p>This is just a thought, it may or may not work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have reservations about the ru ligature, certainly there is a white area in the original, but that is part of the nature of the characters and I think that it is important to keep them seperate, in order to address the uneven white space I would suggest kerning the other characters further apart and redrawing the loop of the j to compensate (though without the arrow). I would also consider dropping any pictorial reference to a compass, there is enough in the name and I assume nearly all the students would make the connection. For the La the unicase style isn&rsquo;t working for me could you make them the same point size and nestle the a in the angle of the L. I find the accent a little stunted as if it is cut off before it reaches a point, the purpose would I guess have been to make it work within Rotis at text sizes, I think you could make it lean more to the horizontal more sympathetic to the angle of the serifs and finish it with a narrower end and return to the cropped off serif, you could even consider removing the dot of the j.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello!
I didn&rsquo;t post since a long time friends, and a lot of things happened to the header&hellip; First, terrible thing to say, is that the magazine crew didn&rsquo;t like it a all (we went with one of the above with slight mods), and I mean, AT ALL.</p>
<p>We had to totally change it, this time they wanted something more &ldquo;product-like&rdquo;, &ldquo;according to current aesthetic tendencies&rdquo;, not so &ldquo;classic&rdquo; or &ldquo;boring&rdquo; they sayd. We&rsquo;ll, what can I say&hellip;</p>
<p>We had to redo it, all the way from the drawingboard.
This time I took advantage of my partner and did it by myself.
The concepts were &ldquo;variety/diversty&rdquo; and &ldquo;change (constant movement)&rdquo;, refering to the aspects which we presume identify the community.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/cabezote_v0_6607.2b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t had so mucho time, so this was only one first intent and one small correction. Then it went straight to the plates (30,000 on magazines already, also some posters/advertising).</p>
<p>There have been released 3 numbers of the magazine, and we&rsquo;re planning to improve some things for the next year. I would like to start from the header. Then I remembered how supportive you guys were with the first one. ;)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go soft with critics/observations. I know we&rsquo;ve got a lot to improve. Regards,</p>
<p>PS: I&rsquo;ll be posting/linking some of the covers/pages of the magazine so you can check them out ;)
Btw, UJTL is short for &ldquo;Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think the one they went with is almost illegible, and looks very dated like what was in style in the US 8-10 years ago. Funny how they didn&rsquo;t want anything classic or boring, and yet the logo is made up of parts of &ldquo;classic&rdquo; scripts and &ldquo;boring&rdquo; sans serifs.</p>
<p>I would advise coming up with 3 different concepts to present, not just variations on 1 concept like what you posted earlier in the thread.</p>
