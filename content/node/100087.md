body: "\r\nAs a Fontlab beginner I'm still unclear what role sidebearings play. \r\n\r\nShould
  they be used to denote the bounding box of a glyph, in which case letter-spacing
  is done entirely through kerning classes? Or should they denote a glyph's default
  letter-spacing, in which case kerning classes are an additional layer of spacing
  refinement? \r\n\r\nTake the letter /I, for example: should you put the sidebearings
  adjacent to the edges of the glyph (so that the bottom-left corner has coordintes
  [0, 0]), or should you place them wherever you feel the default spacing should be
  (e.g. 50 pts away from each side of the glyph)? \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!"

    only on kerning would be a nightmare: you'd have to kern every single pair! Plus
    some software ignores the kerning.\r\n\r\nSo you set the sidebearings as best
    you can, accommodating all the possibilities as best you can. Just be warned:
    this makes the act of spacing a very zen-like effort.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    go a long way to help your understanding.

  body: "As a rule, I kern all possible letter combinations, plus numbers, common
    symbols and punctuation. BUT\u2026before I kern, I go through all of the combinations
    in the Metrics Window. A slight nudge here and there can end up substantially
    reducing the number of kerning pairs required\u2026or sometimes not.\r\n\r\nOnce
    upon a time, I created outlines for a font with very unusual serifs (I was going
    to call the font Twinkletoes) based on hand-lettering from an old chapbook. As
    it turned out, the only way the letters really looked good together was as they
    were presented in the book\u2014A to Z, upper and lower. Virtually EVERY other
    letter combination required kerning. Bummer\u2026"

    by Charles to just check the sidebearings of an existing (possibly similar) typeface.
    Thanks guys!

  body: 'To make your life a lot easier you should get your head around classes -
    both metrics and kerning. By doing this you can apply the same values to the similar
    elements of different characters, for example the left sides of b, h, i, k, l,
    m, n, p, r. And curved sides like the right of b, o  and p. etc. Setting classes
    up properly in the first place can hugely decrease the amount of time spent spacing
    and kerning , and also the number of kern pairs. It also helps consistency. If
    you end up with thousands of pairs you''re doing it wrong. '
