  body: "I started working on the Russian set today. Very quick draft. How does this
    look? I found out some characters have more than one handwritten form. I don't
    know how to decide which to choose.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jprussian_3497.JPG]\r\nI
    appreciate your feedback on this. I know the color is different from the Latin
    and Greek set. Should be a tad lighter, I think. Also, it doesn't seem to have
    the same feel. Any help? Maybe it's the small number of characters with ascenders
    and descenders?"

  body: "hi James\r\n\r\ni like your font very much.\r\nas not russian, but native
    cyrillic reader i think you need more experience with cyrillic handwriting. please
    give more looks on cyrillic scripts from ukrainian, serbian, belarusian and russian
    calligraphers, so you will know more about natural forms.\r\n\r\nabout this scetch
    i want you to use more of your delightful thinnest endings, it would work best
    in descenders of -\u0446-\u0449- or connector in -\u044B-. break this unusual
    loop in -\u043D-, make more flamable ascender in -\u0431- (it may rather not be
    similar to -delta-), look for natural shapes for -\u043B-\u0444-\u0433-\u0447-.
    ovals in -\u0432- and -\u044C- may get endings not to down, but to right, and
    right stem in -\u044F- need some too. won't try to use your pretty -theta- as
    cyrillic -\u0442-?\r\n\r\ni wish you make a beauty cyrillic,\r\nsorry for my english\r\n\r\nAndrij"

    have made these changes with your help. Am I on the right track? I will keep looking
    for handwritten Cyrillic samples to get a better idea of what looks natural.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jpcyrtyp2_4659.JPG]"

  body: "James,\r\nmy english is very poor, so i talk\r\nabout these new shapes shortly:\r\n-\u0432-
    is better, but top loop is too small and connection of loops too dark. don\u2019t
    be afraid to break bottom oval a little, and give your thin connection line to
    right. this letter may respond to -o- so very thin line to right is ok.\r\nsomething
    similar is with ovals in -\u044C-\u044A-\u044B-. generally speaking, -\u044B-
    is historic ligature, that stay in russian, so you can use oval in it like a prototype
    for -\u044C-\u044A- (but please make horizontal connection more thiner).\r\n\r\n-\u044F-
    now is too narrow and rotated for me. try to move right leg to the right to wide
    and fix it to the line?\r\n\r\ni like better previous version of -\u0431-, it
    need only move ascender\u2019s tail up, but round form for ascender is ok\r\n\r\n-\u0433-
    don\u2019t need to start so straight up like your, make this letter more wavelike\r\n\r\nupper
    arc in -\u0447- can be very plain in scripts, and can correspond to -\u044A-\r\n\r\ni\u2019d
    like to see more brave descenders in -\u0446-\u0449-, it can look similar to descender
    of -g- or -y-\r\n\r\ni hope this can help\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile01_4727.png]"
