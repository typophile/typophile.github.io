  body: "I'd use the ampersand from a font that held some special significance to
    me. Maybe the & from my wedding invite, or the ones from Joanna and Georgia (my
    daughters names are Johanna and Georgia, for reasons unrelated to type.)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    if there's an ampersand in the epitaph of one of your heros, or a relative. Do
    a rubbing and use that. The possibilities to work some kind of meaning into it
    are endless. "

    would hope someone would stop me.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think the more ill-advised a
    tattoo, the better it will ultimately serve as a reminder of the transience of
    identity. One fantastic reason to get a tattoo is that (most) people harbor delusions
    that at least some of the things that make them who they are are immutable. I\u2019d
    be surprised if anything about a person is necessarily safe from change. I know
    a lot of self-serving middle-aged types who could benefit from a daily reminder
    that they were once myopic 20-year-olds.\r\n\r\nAnd that said, the illusion of
    the durability of identity is often a very complete one, and the pleasure (short-term)
    of a tattoo can be great. It\u2019s an experience, and one that carries truly
    minor risks compared to some of the things people do to metaphysically scarify
    themselves. \r\n"
