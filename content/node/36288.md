  wondered ever since I saw Bladerunner, the R.Scott sci fi movie\r\nHas anyone noticed
  that Bladerunner uses a similar 3 character screen motif in some gui mock-ups very
  similar to the HAL 9000 screens in 2001?\r\n\r\nI'd always thought that Eurostyle
  would be a good approximation for the HAL typeface in bold (possibly extended? -
  I'm not that familiar with eurostyle) \r\ndoes anyone know what the actual typeface
  used was?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HAL_6499.gif]\r\n\r\nshould
  I post this to font ident forum?\r\nI hesitate, because I have such a poor screenshot."

    (1952) by Aldo Novarese who later designed the <cite>improved</cite> Eurostile.

  body: "Yes. I think you are right.\r\nlooking again at some youtube extracts that
    show different characters I'd say it looks like microgramma. \r\n(even though
    eurostile is similar, microgramma has a more rounded junction within its joins,
    which are evident.)\r\n\r\nthanks Geoff."

    favorite fonts of sci-fi filmmakers. Although it takes quite a leap of faith to
    believe that the other 12 human tribes developed the same alphabet and typefaces
    as we did during the eons we were divided & yet \u2014 managed to get the form
    factor of books, paper and screens completely wrong, with these cut-off corners\u2026
    ; )\r\n\r\nI refer to Battlestar Galactica, of course.\r\n\r\n___\r\nBert Vanderveen
