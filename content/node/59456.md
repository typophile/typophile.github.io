body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI have a major problem with my (already quite short) descenders:
  they don't appear on screen! It seems to be a hinting problem, but I tried the auto-hinting
  in fontlab and a manual basic hinting (even worst), the alignement zones are set,
  and still I have nothing under the baseline (the commas do strange things as well...
  oh wait, the g is ok)\r\nAnother typeface I am working on works fine on screen,
  without hinting and with completely screwed up zones, and I couldn't find any difference
  in the font infos.\r\n\r\nDoes someone have a idea?"

  body: "Thanks for answering!\r\nIt is a TrueType and the problem is not size specific,
    I have to zoom in a lot to see the descenders appearing. The only solution I found
    is to copy-paste the whole font in a new empty file and re-import the classes
    & co, there must be a strange hidden value somewhere..."

  body: Sounds like the descender values are not right...I'm no expert but check the
    values in the font info box.

  body: If the g is displaying correctly, that implies something other than vertical
    metrics. Puzzling, to say the least.

  body: I would check the alignment zones. I ran into a font once that had really
    strange values for these that displayed similar peculiarities, and that was the
    cause.
