  \ I like the logo and now I am looking for fonts to go with the logo on my website
  or print media.\r\n\r\nLooking for heading, subheading and text fonts that are playful
  but still professional.\r\n\r\n"

    font? If so why? Maybe you could use the bold version of Avenier (I think that
    is the font used for \"bee\") or use the same font for both \"two\" and \"bee\"
    and just make the \"two\" a bold/heavy/black version.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion,
    though, the illustration was very nice."

  body: "Thanks for the comments.  My friend is working on incorporating another bee
    into the logo.  We went with the outline on the \"bee\" because the plain yellow
    didn't show up that well when printed on white media.  Can you suggest another
    way to do the \"bee\" without the outline so that it will show up?\r\n\r\nI really
    like Avenier.  I also like to mix and match fonts some.  What would your recommend
    to go with?\r\n\r\nThanks again.  Since this is a small side project with a very
    small budget, all your opinions help so much.\r\n"

  body: "cute drawing; outline -- keep it the same color; head -- the yellow is not
    right, you can't have two highlights; right leg -- is not right.\r\n\r\n"
