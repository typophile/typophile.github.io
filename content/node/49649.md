body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm stuck with a major problem here. Since I've updated to Leopard,
  the OpenType & Classes panels in FLS 5.0.4 don't show anymore. I temporarily do
  all the features and class work on my old PowerBook running Panther (on which I
  haven't encountered any problem so far). \r\n\r\nIs this vanished-panels-thing a
  known issue?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSteph"

  body: "I encountered a similar issue but under the Windows version. Apparently some
    preferences got corrupted and apparently FontLab does not deal with those very
    well.\r\n\r\nI would try quitting FontLab, then removing the com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist
    file which resides in ~/Library/Preferences and start FontLab again and see if
    it helps. Be advised that doing this may (...will) reset a lot of other preferences
    that you've set (global options, etc.) so you may not want to pemanently delete
    that file...just move it out of the prefs folder onto your desktop or something,
    temporarily. \r\n\r\nOr, If you're comfortable with editing .plist files you could
    probably just edit the specific key, which I think is under <Root>/General/ClassListWidth.
    Mine is currently set to \"142\". There may be other similar values that need
    updating for your specific case.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your comment. I removed the .plist file as you advised, but it
    doesn't help at all. And since I'm not that of a tech wizard, I didn't dare editing
    this file. Reinstall FontLab didn't help either.\r\n\r\nReminds me of the Terminator
    that wouldn't die in the first episode."

  body: Wow - thanks Miguel! I didn't know that trick. Now I can carry on FontLabbing
    without having to use different computers to have the job done! What a relief.
