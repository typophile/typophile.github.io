    the units per em you were using and also on the style of the typeface itself.
    Once you have a value to start from (establishing the normal weight makes most
    sense) there are numerous ways of distributing the weights.\r\n\r\nThis thread\r\n\r\n<a>http://typophile.com/node/83010</a>\r\n\r\nhas
    a good discussion about the theory of it, and I'm sure there are lots of others."

  body: "I once did it, out of curiosity. Measuring the stem of the lowercase i and
    averaging a large number of fonts, both sans and serif. \r\n\r\nIt resulted into
    this (translated to UPM 1000):\r\n006 Hairline\r\n023 Thin\r\n040 Extra Light\r\n057

    Ultra\r\n\r\nBut don't take it to seriously. It's only and average and has no
    practical use.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Probably not very useful but still interesting stuff, Pablo. Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nI
    am curious: Did you notice any significant differences when comparing sans stems
    vs. serif stems? I am wondering if sans stems could be a bit lighter on average."

  body: "This question is futile, because absolute stem width is irrrelevant, due
    to:\r\n- the arbitrary nature of glyph size relative to em square\r\n- the different
    requirements of different type styles, in particular:\r\n- the role of x-height,
    which also raises the issue of:\r\n- difference in stem width between caps and
    lower case\r\n\r\nHere are some common types, at the same nominal point size at
    left, and with x-heights equalized, at right.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hilby_5655.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    last two, Futura and Verdana, appear to have radically different stem widths at
    the same point size, but with x-heights equalized, very similar."

    will be a bit lighter, since the serifs in itself are adding mass to the glyphs.\r\n\r\nIn
    my Quattrocento Sans and Serf fonts, the serif stem is 66 and the sans stem is
    70."

  body: Frutiger Medium has a perfect 1:5 stroke width to height ratio, a do a lot
    of Medium weight designs. Not the worst thing in the world to emulate, but not
    necessary either.

    little larger in the digital font, 1:5.4, presumably to allow for ink gain. "
