  Font failed me and I'm turning to you good people in my hour of need. I've isolated

  body: It's a predigital Filmotype font called Hudson Script. Digitally, it's available
    as Fontbank's <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/martina.htm" target="_blank">Martina</a>
    and <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank">Brendel's</a> <a href="http://www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=tc.gif/Stc01413.gif"
    target="_blank">Hudson</a>. No guarantee of quality with either of these.
