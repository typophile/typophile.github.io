body: "Hey im currently working on the partly spare time i have on a \"my cities\"
  series, about cities i have been to...my most recent piece of London was in the
  \"my london\" Exhibition. The series i am doing is fully typographically based,
  and each print is about a metre by half a metre in size. i do limited edition prints
  of about 10 as lino is not the easiest of things to print a lot of if you dont have
  the right equiptment...anyway if anyone is interested then get aquireing one or
  if you have any questions then please let me know...\r\n\r\nheres a picture of the
  lino + artist proof i did as a starter for it...... i have also done a new york
  print too, from my work i have got into ISTD which is why i was able to take part
  in the london design festival exhibition that ISTD put on.. \r\n<img src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i221/dexter121uk/finishedlinocutprint.jpg\"
