  <BR> <BR>As far as type goes, I went with Zapf Humanist. I was leaning toward any
  of the less &#34;mechanical&#34; Adobe sans faces like Eurostyle, Geometric231,
  Officina Sans, or Rotis. Any thoughts on the all lower case thing? <BR> <BR>The

  body: I think Optima is working great here. <BR>Just the full-height numerals look
    too big on the 3rd line. And I&#39;d superscript the &#34;th&#34;. And use small
    mid-dots instead of periods in the phone number. And maybe replace the comma with
    a mid-dot. And move the box slightly to the right. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hi Hrant, <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking a look-see. Did I use Optima? I thought
    for sure I&#39;d used Z.H.. <BR> <BR>Yeah, that&#39;s a good point on the numerals.
    That&#39;s a made-up address so it may not be an issue -- I&#39;ll wait and see
    what the real address is before I decide what to do.

    care for the name, title, address <BR>etc. all in the same text block with no

    radiates a yucky aura -- 80s, banking, real estate. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR>&#60;font

  body: '&#62; real estate <BR> <BR>The first time you said that I didn&#39;t say
    anything, but now I gotta ask: <BR>Where did you get this Optima/Real-Estate angle?
    I&#39;ve seen them use Optima Bold in all caps, but really, the main thing Optima
    is associated with is cosmetics. Which makes it a great choice for masseuse: not
    too predictable, but a fruitful association. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Linotype had some Optima Nova stuff in the <BR>TypeCon goodie bag. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    check it out again.  <BR> <BR>I recently had a discussion with someone who <BR>insisted
    on using Andale Mono for something. <BR>I told him that was a face to avoid. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>In the bag of typefaces to avoid in general, I&#39;d toss in Optima,  <BR>the
    Apple System Fonts, the <BR>early 90s overused Emigre stuff,  <BR>and the &#39;tawdry&#39;&#42;
    stuff that sometimes comes in a big free bundle. <BR> <BR>Of course, there are

    lowercase, with a slightly feminine quality overall. I think it would make an
    excellent choice.

  body: John, I don&#39;t think Gill Sans light needs to be spaced a bit looser when
    you use it. And, because it is so thin, and you are reversing out the type, it
    will be swallowed whole by the ink unless you use it quite large. Which reminds
    me of a question I had for you yesterday. What point size are you using?
