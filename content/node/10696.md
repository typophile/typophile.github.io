body: This is a type based on the notes in my sketchbook. Usually I write with a fine
  Sharpie on thinish paper which absorbs and spreads most of the ink. Hmmmm....I&#39;ve
  wanted to use my print on posters before, so this is my attempt to digitalize it.<img

  body: I think the &#34;z&#34; is too wide and the &#34;q&#34; should back slant
    like the rest. <BR> <BR>I really like that &#34;B&#34;. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: 'yup. the z is too wide, but i know you&#39;re fixing that. i agree that the
    B is really nice, but disagree that the q should back slant--handwriting is handwriting,
    plus it adds some variety and keeps things from being too systematic. also the
    angle echoes the z and y descenders. overall the face has a real nice energy and
    positive feel, maybe due to the stems thickening at the top and the upward thrust
    of the B, p, and e. another nice quirk, in addition to the B stem, is the descender
    on the z. if you can keep that, it will be a nice touch on the rare occasion of
    its use. the lowered x is nice as well--keeps things spontaneous. '

  body: I think I asked this a while back, but for the sake of the newer members...what
    do you think of &#34;correcting&#34; handwritten fonts? i.e. seanmichael&#39;s
    comment about changing the slant of the &#34;q&#34;. Doesn&#39;t that take away
    from the authentic handwritten look? <BR> <BR>I think this is very nice, BTW.
