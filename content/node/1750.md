body: "Here is the info i can provide:\r\n\r\nThe Typeface chosen for the headlines
  is [[Gotham]] from Hoefler, you can see it here, i might variate the weight from
  article to article, but usually go with medium.\r\n(see here: <A HREF=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/more5.html\"
  TARGET=\"_top\">http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/more5.html</A>}\r\n\r\nIt
  will be for a magazine about culture and life on a danish island called \"funen\"
  - it's qualities (the ones we try and get across atleast) are that of hardworking,
  sturdy, stabile, well crafted, down to earth exelence.\r\n\r\nI hope to print on
  white uncoated paper, around 100-120 gsm\r\n\r\nThe body copy i hope to set in three
  collumns\r\n\r\nformat - close to a regular a4\r\n\r\ni'll look forward to any well
  qualified bids on a serif body copy face (also used bigger for pull quotes)"

  body: I, too, think Hrant&#39;s idea might be a good one. But I was thinking something
    more like <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4008.html" TARGET="_blank">
    Linoletter</A> or <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily69.html" TARGET="_blank">
    Egyptienne F</A> for magazine text. Worth a shot, I think. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

  body: Yes, the 505 is nice too. Both the 505 and Linoletter are by Andr&eacute;
    G&uuml;rtler &#40;the latter with Reinhard Haus&#41;. The earlier Egyptienne F
    is Frutiger&#39;s. <BR> <BR>BTW, didn&#39;t <I>Eye</I> recently pick up one of
    these Egyptians for its Reviews section? I don&#39;t have a copy here so I can&#39;t
    check which one. <BR> <BR>Hrant, what&#39;s so &#42;infamous&#42; about Linoletter?
    Did I miss that episode of <I>60 Minutes</I>? <BR> <BR>-- K.

    actually I guess it&#39;s not famous enough to be &#42;infamous&#42;... But it&#39;s
    the type of design &#40;hyper-rational eurocratic&#42;&#41; that gets a bad rap
    among today&#39;s oh-so-intuitively-talented &#34;artiste&#34;s; and the -admittedly
    rare- comments I&#39;ve read about it were negative. <BR> <BR>&#42; A Gurtler
    specialty. I don&#39;t like bureaucracy, but I actually don&#39;t think he was
    guilty of that - I personally love the guy. Unica rules. And the Egyptian505 numerals
    are what they need to be. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' hi kent funny you should mention it, it&#39;s the egyptienne f - by frutiger,
    that you mentioned, also they use it on uncoated, i noticed after you mentioned
    it as a possibility - and i actually think it will be my choice, maybe slightly
    larger than the tight  4 collumn grid they use for the review section '
