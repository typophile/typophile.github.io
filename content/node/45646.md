  body: "Dang, good question.  Well, the album came out in 1988, so that narrows it
    down a bit (i guess).  It almost looks like a modified version of Akzidenz Grotesk
    Bold Condensed...its so/so close.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_4914.gif]"

  body: Yeah it's tough, I might try and email HAZE who designed it and find out if
    I can get a response. It's close to what you mentioned yet is blockier and less
    rounded, someone has to know this one.

  body: "man....Haze designed everything.  I don't really have any other ideas on
    the font, but I do know that it was somehow modified (see aligned img below),
    so it might be tough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3-00-17-09_4298.gif]"

  body: "Yeah\u2026 I actually emailed him. He said it was all done from scratch before
    Mac computers using a t-square, pencil and tracing paper then inking the final
    version by hand with rapidographs\u2026"
