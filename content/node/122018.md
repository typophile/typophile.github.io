body: I have this blog header the was made several years ago and now I can't for the
  life of me remember what fonts were used. I am hoping to make some updates to it
  but would like to use the same fonts, or something very close to it. Any help would
  be appreciated. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sa_blogheader_6428.png]
