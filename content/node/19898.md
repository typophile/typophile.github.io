    target=\"_blank\">Rosewood <em>( Regular )</em></a>' without the 'insets'. <em>(
    Even no need to create the shadow, just remove the inner parts. :)</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moma_4144.png]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDav"

  body: "I think it\u2019s part of Font Folio, so you might find it at adobe.com.
    But if I remember correctly, it\u2019s just the \u2018whole thing\u2019 and the
    Fill. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s strange how much the Fill cut gets used these days. It
    needs quite a lot kerning work."
