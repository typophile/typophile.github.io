  4AD record covers (for bands like Cocteau Twins, Modern English, This Mortal Coil,
  etc). I assume that he is also the person who designed the 4AD logo *itself* (which
  I'm trying to attach here and which in any case can be easily seen at www.4ad.com).
  However, I do not know for absolute certain that this is true. Does anyone know
  for sure who designed the 4AD logo? Thanks! \r\n\r\n"

    the calligraphic work at V23, aka Envelope 23.

    body: "Thanks for the replies - Norman, you're the only one who states definitively
      that Vaughan Oliver did the logo... I'm not being facetious, but how do you
      know? I mean, I know he was the house designer, but is that in itself hard evidence
      that he did the logo?\r\n\r\nI do know that 4AD's first couple of records did
      not have the logo and only starting getting them a year or two later after Oliver
      joined them. This suggests that he's the designer, but again is not evidence..."

  body: "Have you seen the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD\">Wikipedia
    entry</a> for <strong>4AD</strong>? It says, in part: \"It was originally formed
    as Axis Records, but this was quickly changed to 4AD when it became apparent that
    the name Axis was already being used by another music company. The 4AD logo is
    a spoof of the AAD Audio CD process designation.\"\r\n\r\nDon't know whether this
    is true or not. However, there is a lengthier, very detailed history of the label
    (cited in the Wikipedia entry) on a site called <a href=\"http://www.fedge.net/ftww/index.html\">Facing
    the Wrong Way</a>. Go to their Features section and you will find the history
    of the label.\r\n\r\nYou might also try your luck searching in Rick Poynor's book,
    <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861540728/qid=1139374971/sr=1-23/ref=sr_1_23/002-3207693-3888066?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\">Vaughan
    Oliver: Visceral Pleasures</a>. \r\n\r\nAnother good bet is an older book, <a
    href=\"http://www.artbooks.de/v23/trr.html\">This Rimy River</a>, which is the
    catalog for a v23 exhibition.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, and hard to find: <a
    href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=09\">Issue 9 of Emigre magazine</a>
    had interviews with Vaughan Oliver and Ivo Watts-Russell (4AD's owner, at least
    back then)..."

    body: "Regarding the origin of the 4AD label name, as far as I know it was a play
      on the words \"1980 FORWARD\" which appeared on an early flyer. As mentioned
      by Ricardo, the original label was called AXIS, but they had to change it because
      some other company already had the name. However, during the first year of the
      record company they had already put out a couple of records under the AXIS name.
      An AXIS flyer they had produced in order to advertise these releases (which
      were put out in 1980) had the following play on words printed on it:\r\n\r\n1980
      FORWARD\r\n1980 FWD\r\n1984 AD\r\n4AD\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, Ivo and Peter
      (the founders of 4AD) were scrambling for a new name for the company and took
      \"4AD\" from this flyer. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm getting a tattoo of the label
      in a couple of weeks so this is why I brought it all up to begin with!"
