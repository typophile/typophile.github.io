body: "Always careful not to scream \"Bug!\", but what I'm seeing on my screen is
  at least odd. I've made an Open Type font that can produce nut fractions, fractions
  with a horizontal bar between numerator and denominator. Strictly speaking these
  kind of fractions belong in the \"afrc\" feature, but I put them in the frac feature
  because that's the one Adobe apps support (with InDesign as main target). The feature
  consists of a mixture of subtitution and positioning lookups. For instance, if you
  type \"1/23\", the 1 will be replaced by a numerator, the slash by a horizontal
  bar twice the width of single digit and the 2 and 3 will be replaced by denominators.
  The 1 will be shifted to the right, to center it above the bar, the bar is positioned
  underneath the 1, and the 2 and 3 are positioned underneath the bar. Works fine
  in Fontlab, works fine in InDesign (CS and CS2). So far so good. When I checked
  the font in Illustrator (CS and CS2) the fraction feature only triggered the substitution
  lookups, not the positioning. Same result in Photoshop. Is this an example of differences
  in type rendering engines between Adobe apps (in this case Indesign vs AI/PS) shining
  through? Am I missing something in the Open Type specs? Anyone any thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nKind

  body: "It's almost certainly not you, but Illustrator. The rendering engine and
    underlying font engine is shared across all the major Adobe apps, but the text
    engine is not (though Illustrator and Photoshop do share their text engine), and
    there's where the problem lies.\r\n\r\nWe don't have anything like this in-house
    to test with. If you'd be willing to share the font along with a description of
    the problem, I can pass it on to the relevant engineers. With any luck we could
    get this fixed for a future version of the Creative Suite.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

      kind of behaviour without sending you my bunch of code (which I'm willing to
      send of course). Just put any kind of positioning lookup in the frac feature
      and it will be ignored by Illustrator.\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nPaul"

  body: "I've done the same thing.\r\nI optimized for InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    I have with Illustrator is that in order to position the superior figure, bar(s),
    and inferior figure on the same vertical axis, I've given my horizontal bar(s)
    negative sidebearings, and while InDesign recognizes them on both sides, Illustrator
    appears not to recognize the right-side negative sidebearing -- so I'm contemplating
    closing up the space between figure and bar by kerning instead.\r\nBut perhaps
    I will not bother, as I don't believe that Illustrator users have any need of
    fractions.\r\n\r\nQuark 7 offers \"fraction\" in its OpenType menu, but it is
    not the correct \"Fraction\" feature: rather, it is a \"hack\" using the numerator,
    fraction slash (virgule) and denominator features.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frax.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think it may be possible to achieve consistency across the applications by replacing
    the angled virgule with a horizontal bar, making superiors and numerators identical,
    and inferiors and denominators identical, and positioning the fraction elements
    by kerning -- although the kerning support of OpenType fonts in the beta of Quark
    7 is incomplete."

  body: "Wow, looks nice.\r\n\r\nWhat the XPress 7 frac feature does is exactly what
    the specs say. So literally, this is not \"hack\" but \"the right thing\". But
    nicely indicates that specs are a bit behind real-world development.\r\n\r\n<cite>...
    although the kerning support of OpenType fonts in the beta of Quark 7 is incomplete.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere
    are always applications which don't support things correctly. Making OpenType
    fonts either means: including the nice things which specs promised, or: making
    fonts that work in a majority of applications. If anyone knows how to do both,
    please let me know. :)\r\n \r\nMore and more I am convinced that trying to get
    fonts right is one thing. Another one would be to tell application developers
    explicitly what they shall do with all the information they can find in OpenType
    fonts! Like, we find the entire history of digital type represented in a collection
    of font name entries, or three sets of vertical metrics values, or a strange numeric
    weight value which is even used by apps which otherwise read legacy family/style
    name (with the nice effect that weight value must be set \"wrongly\" [specs p.o.v.]
    so that they work \"right\" [applications' p.o.v.], or style linking doesn't work)
    &c ... And there isn't a chance to get rid of some of these information if fonts
    shall be backward compatible. Which also means that most likely -- because information
    are there -- even future apps may make use of them."

  body: "When I noticed that Nick Shinn said, \"I don\u2019t believe that Illustrator
    users have any need of fractions.\", I wanted to respond with a plea that some
    of us need all the power for setting mathematical expressions you can give us
    in both Illustrator and Indesign! Please consider that any mathematical expression
    an author/scientist might want to write in a figure for a journal article or book
    needs to be doable in Illustrator so that it looks good when put in InDesign.\r\n\r\nAs
    another example, in Indesign I figured out how to insert multiple non-breaking
    white spaces each with negative kerning to write a Greek word with both a superscript
    and a subscript that start at the same position. (The text contains 139,000 Greek
    words, each with a id superscript and a separate id subscript). \r\n\r\nFrom comments
    I have seen others also are struggling with math expressions in text (InDesign)
    and figures (Illustrator) even when we buy math plugins."

  body: "<cite>What the XPress 7 frac feature does is exactly what the specs say.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think QuarkXPress violates the specification, because it ignores the following
    rule:\r\n\r\n<code>When the full sequence is found in the frac coverage table,
    the application passes the sequence to the frac table and gets a new GID in return.</code>\r\n\r\nInstead
    of that it directly assumes case two:\r\n\r\n<code>When the frac table does not
    contain an exact match, the application performs two steps. First, it uses the
    numr feature (see below) to replace figures (as used in the numr coverage table)
    preceding the slash with numerators, and to replace the typographic slash character
    (U+002F) with the fraction slash character (U+2044). Second, it uses the dnom
    feature (see below) to replace all remaining figures (as listed in the dnom coverage
    table) with denominators.</code>\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem can be solved by a hack.
    (At least the slash can be substituted in the numerator feature. And then it will
    not be automatically replaced by QuarkXPress.)\r\n\r\nAt first QuarkXPress seems
    to check, if a string \"figure slash figure\" is present in the text for which
    the fraction feature shall be applied. And then it goes to the numerator feature.
    If the slash is not substituted there, Quark replaces the slash automatically,
    before the substitutions embedded in the frac feature can be applied. So \"sub
    slash by fraction.alt\" is ignored in the frac feature, because the slash already
    was replaced by the fraction.\r\n\r\nI did make a quick test only. I may be wrong.
    And in cases, where you have a string of a prebuilt fraction followed by a number,
    Quark is not replacing anything, because the slash is missing in the string. This
    problem could maybe solved by integrating a multiple substitution like \"sub onequarter
    by one.numerator slash four.denominator\" in the numerator feature. But I did
    not check that."
