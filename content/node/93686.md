  fascinating image.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fourier_3724.png]\r\n\r\n\"Here
  the white bands show the frequency of the black running across the page, with the
  distance between the whites I believe being about the width of the n. (Thanks to
  Peter Enneson for the graphic.)\"\r\n\r\nApparently this was generated from a font
  using Fourier transforms, but I can't seem to find much about exactly how this was
  done.  I have been interested in images that convey information about type faces
  in an abstract and non-text way for some time now."

    is an image that uses Futura in a 'abstract and non text' setting.  What appeals
    to me is that it still exudes all the personality of a setting of Futura, without
    using words and individual letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/futuraNewLook_5489.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    image is from \"FUTURA by AG4,\" well worth watching in its own right.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7jnGaNaPKI"

    out some way of using this analysis method to provide qualitative feedback to
    a font designer while they are working on their font.  I wonder if it could be
    used to identify \"poorer\" type design, and \"better\" type design?\r\n\r\nHere
    are 2 images made from the same text.  I attempted to make them as square as possible.
    \ The first uses a typeface I think most of us find \"better\" -- Gill Sans Medium.
    \ The second uses a typeface I think most of us find \"poorer\" -- Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder how the resulting FFT derived and posterized images would be different
    between the two?\r\n\r\nNote: In an attempt to make the 2 images as close as possible,
    I had to adjust the scale of the Comic Sans version both in width and height,
    as well as its' letter and word spacing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aeneas_Text_Gill_Sans_Medium_6146.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aeneas_Text_Comic_Sans_3896.png]"

    type design, and \u201Cbetter\u201D type design?\u201D\r\n\r\nI think this is
    possible, but we need to establish what the benchmarks are. This might require
    a large comparative database, good theories about cortical integrational mechanics,
    and some sensitive tests for readability that go beyond basic reading speed. I
    think I have a decent handle on extracting spacing benchmarks from fourier transforms.\r\n\r\nI
    discussed fourier transforms in a presentation I did some years ago.  See:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_slides.pdf\r\nstarting
    on page 20\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_script.pdf\r\nstarting
    on page 6\r\n\r\nThe incentive for doing these was a discussion on typophile initiated
    by Raph Levien I believe, about typographical spacing systems currently in use
    based on different spacing algorithms implemented in page makeup software like
    InDesign and QuarkXPress. I believe this was in 2005 or earlier and led to:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/fs_spacing_protocols.pdf\r\nWhat
    I was looking at was the amount of \u201Cphase alignment\u201D of  the vertical
    parts of strokes, as signaled by the structure of the  brightest sections on the
    x-axis of the transforms. White means \u2018lots.\u2019 Phase alignment has to
    do with proportionality in the width-of-letters dimension and spacing combined.
    Well-set type by typographic standards typically results in a narrow phase alignment
    without strong competing harmonics (such as one should find in grating patterns,
    where auto-correlation is ubiquitous and the phase-alignment is absolute). If
    the phase-alignment is so narrow it causes competing harmonics, there is a picket-fence
    effect.\r\n\r\nPhase alignment differs from type to type, but in all well-set
    type (by typographic standards), follows the same pattern:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/fs_font_comparison.pdf\r\n\r\nIt's
    characteristics also vary with weight (or boldness) and polarity:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/fs_blk_versus_wht.pdf\r\nI
    haven't isolated the issue of serifs / sans serifs or contrast (traditional, eg.
    garamond versus modern, eg. bodoni)\r\n\r\nHere are more that relate to spacing:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/fs_spacing_mendoza_coarse.pdf\r\nChanging
    spacing causes a horizontal shift in phase, and effects how diffuse or sharp the
    phase alignment is. Presumably these values can be quantified. This is explored
    further here:\r\nhttp://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/fourier_suite/fs_spacing_mendoza_fine.pdf\r\nThe
    choice of Mendoza in these test is somewhat arbitrary \u2014 I was using the face
    in one of my projects.\r\n\r\nI concentrated on the information in the horizontal
    axis. Luciano Perondi (Italy) did some work with fourier transforms surrounding
    the question of even colour and irregularities in fonts for ATypI Helsinki in
    2005. These factors would probably relate to other parts of the transforms than
    just the horizontal or vertical axis.\r\n\r\nThe black in the transforms is noise.
    I couldn't find a more sophisticated way to highlight the aspect I was looking
    for.\r\n\r\nThe work I did was in the frequency domain. Fourier transforms also
    put amplitude results in a separate channel. I tried to look at amplitude results
    for letters, words and extended text, but couldn't determine how amplitude results
    could be of use.\r\n\r\nI hope these are of use.\r\nPeter"
