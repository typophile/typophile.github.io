  for a University project and I would like to find 10 different display fonts to
  use in the title for each year. I was thinking of typefaces like Cooper Black, Pump
  Triline (though that may be more 1970's) and Decorated (451?)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  are welcome!\r\n\r\nJim"

    Minott's Davida (1965).\r\nNeo-Victorian, capturing the exuberant \"display\"
    that saw mods adopting Regency, and hippies Victorian military styles, eg in Sgt.

    Pop art. The stencil effect could be Futura Black. Fun to break up the colouring.\r\nBy
    the same token, bouncing was big at the start of the decade."
