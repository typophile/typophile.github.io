    by the Italians maybe (Alessandro?), considered asterisks as part of the fleurons
    or borders and that sort of thing. So it isn't such a stretch to think that it
    is possible that they did call asterisks -- flowers. \r\n\r\n<em>Let the slaughter

  body: For what it's worth, fleurons and asterisks have historically functioned in
    much the same way and are, even today, somewhat interchangeable for most uses.
