  body: "I'd really like see this Grolier exhibit, which celebrates historical French
    types of the late 18th and 19th centuries. Unfortunately, the slide show provided
    by the NTY\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2011/12/24/arts/design/20111224Type.html?ref=design
    \  \r\n\r\nis scant of images of the faces. It does show the very French 'Jaugeon'.
    If I don't get to New York, I'll console myself with Updike."

    old\r\nFrench stuff (preferably over a flute of Veuve Clicquot :-)\r\nyou could
    find a copy of the not-too-rare \"Les Caract\xE8res\r\nde l'Imprimerie Nationale\"
    or the fabulous -and quite rare-\r\n\"Origines de l'imprimerie en France\" of
    1900.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
