body: I am needing some suggestions to help me finish up a logo I have be asked to
  help redesign. Before all we basically had was just our text name. Then they added
  our denominational symbol. But we are needing things to be more modern. Here are
  3 designs I pulled together what are your thoughts or is there another direction
  I should go in?

  body: I would suggest hiring a designer, or searching for one in your congregation.

    your congregation? (A designer in need of work, too!)

  body: I suggest you set aside a budget for this process as it's going to be an important
    part of your identity as a whole. You might be more comfortable with a christian
    designer, but don't write off a non-believer. A good one (from each category)
    would treat your needs with respect and dare to stand up against the design by
    comitee these things tend to become. A bad one (in this category you'll often
    find those buddy favours that don't cost you much) would probably end up just
    as <em>you</em> want it to be, which unfortunately is far off from what it could
    and should be judging by your samples.
