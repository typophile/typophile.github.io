  body: "Your sequencing is wrong Florian. The Brody designs are Art Deco derivatives
    to some extent.\r\nAs for the whole \"is \xE6\xF8\xE5 diacritical characters\"
    question\u2026\r\n\r\nIf anything the image has an Amsterdam Style (the architectonic
    style) vibe."

    much help.\r\n\r\nSome fonts a little bit like it:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ffonts.net/Cyklop-Regular.font|Cyklop
    Regular]]. There's also an italic of this Polish font which is based on a 1920s
    Polish typeface.\r\n\r\nFrom Ryoichi Tsunekawa's Prop-A-Ganda fonts: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/prop-a-ganda/pag-karogs/|PAG
    Karogs]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/prop-a-ganda/pag-etiketa/|PAG Etiketa]]
    and probably a few others.\r\n\r\n[[http://home.tiscali.nl/r_keijzer/searchpage.htm|Richard
    Keijzer]] has some Amsterdam School fonts, but something about the look of his
    website has never prompted me to look into these properly.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-juanita/|ITC
