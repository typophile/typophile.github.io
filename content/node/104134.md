  body: "As to your wording to the topic: given that a term paper involves, at one
    level, selling a professor, the typeface choice didn't so much affect \"how we
    read\" as \"what sells.\" I'd imagine any person connected with advertising would
    not find this outcome at all strange.\r\n\r\nBut more to the point is (best I
    can remember), as we proceed along our educational career, we also figure out
    what sells a professor vis a vis content. To ascribe the better performance simply
    to type selection is a bit quick. And if by some strange chance true, what does
    that say about the cost and value of a college education? "
