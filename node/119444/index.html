  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings, fellow type enthusiasts!
A couple of years ago, I came across [[http://typophile.com/node/31682|a thread on Typophile]] about the "Spice Girls font", a typeface I've been intrigued by ever since I first saw it in 1998. This font has been searched for by many, <em>many</em> people many, <em>many</em> times, but has never been found. The Typophile thread I mentioned did, however, yield a possible lead: the pre-digital typeface called Tempor. (Thanks, Mike F!) According to my (admittedly limited) research, a specimen of sorts was published in <em>The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces</em> (on page 157 according to Solopedia -- though I might be wildly off there). Unfortunately I am unable to obtain a copy of this book at the moment, so I ask: if any of you could please be so kind to upload a scan of this specimen of Tempor, I would sincerely appreciate it. It's a mystery I would <em>love</em> to help solve.
Oh, also, if anyone has <em>any</em> information on it, such as the name/s of its designer/s, foundry, known digitizations, I will love you forever!
Thanks for reading. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you <em>so</em> much, ralphsmouse! I sincerely appreciate it. Yes, I see now that it is similar, but not an exact match. Sigh.
I know the typeface I'm looking for is not custom because I've seen it used a few times over the years on a wide range of things. For example, [[http://media.meltybuzz.fr/article-839395-ajust_930/logo-aides.jpg|the logo of the French charity AIDES]] and a video cassette titled [[http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/12/29/DSCN7505.JPG|<em>Secretos de la Trilogia de Regreso al Futuro</em>]], which I assume is a documentary about the <em>Back to the Future</em> films.
The latter item tells me that the typeface has been in use since at least 1990. Gosh, I wish I could figure this out!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm thinking this typeface could be from a dormant/defunct early digital type foundry. From what I can tell, Spice Girls fans have been trying to figure out the origin of this particular typeface for ages. For that reason, I can't be sure if the typeface was ever widely known or distributed. It might have came on a type CD-ROM package (a very 90's way of distributing digital typefaces).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spice_6302.png]
I lifted this from a Spice Girls autograph sheet. A lot of later samples are horizontally stretched out of this world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My apologies by advance if my words sound lazy/boring/dull/killjoy because everything I'm going to say has already been said and argued. But since it's stumped all type ID communities across the world, maybe it is time to definitely close and accept the evidence... SPICE GIRLS will never return and even if we identify the font.
To me, from what I could see from this CD covers is they're at least 2 different fonts (or 1 font and 1 lettering). /S from 'SPICE' woodmark has a horizontal transition not the one for text. 
The text one looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr|Europa Grotesque]] (less is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/california-grotesk|California Grotesk]] mainly because of /a spur). That said it could be not so hazardous to accept the idea 'SPICE' would be a custom lettering, derived from Europa Grotesk (and very easy to recreate actually). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha! Thanks for the laugh, Ryuk. Yeah, I'll admit it (although I'm pretty sure it's painfully obvious): I'm a Spice Girls fan, have been since I was 13, and yeah, the Spice Girls are definitely <em>not</em> coming back. I'm happy with the fact that they're done, actually; their new material on their <em>Greatest Hits</em> release proved that they're no longer the success that they were back in the late '90s. (Just between us: the new songs were AWFUL. There, I've said it!)
Thank you again for your contributions, ralphsmouse. Appreciated. I, too, have wondered about it being some obscure early digital type, the product of a long-defunct foundry, or simply a face that was offered for a time and then taken off the market (it's downright painful when that happens!).
The closest I've come across is House Gothic -- particularly its Bold Alternate Caps -- by House Industries; the 'S' is remarkably similar -- the other letters ... eh, not quite.
Oh, and thank you too for your input, Riccardo. I love being around knowledgeable type peeps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just for the sake of completeness, and to corroborate what Rob (ralphsmouse) and Ryuk suggested, I will add that, according to MyFonts, the digital Europa Grotesque (2002?) is "based on [ATF's] Europa Grotesque series circa 1960".
So there could have been an early (more or less legit) digitalisation of it, and maybe the horizontal spine of |S| was in the original (or, au contraire, was introduced to get away with the knock-off).
Unfortunately, I'm unable to locate a pre-digital specimen (or any mention of it, for that matter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders_%28list_of_types%29 ).

Full disclosure: I never had willingly (or knowingly) listen anything by the Spice Girls.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Europa Grotesque connection makes sense, guys. Thank you.
To me the "Spice Girls font" seems softer and (dare I say) rounder than Europa Grotesque -- at least the digitalization(s) I've seen. Even so, it doesn't rule out the possibility that it might be derived from Europa Grotesque.
I'm now at the point where I'm considering contacting AIDES to inquire about who designed their logo. Does that make me seem crazy, obsessed and ever so slightly desperate?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking back at the discussion, and by casual visual comparison of the Spice Girls sample posted by rob nolan, to the digital Europa Grotesque and California Grotesque displays at Myfonts, I see the width of the logo as being closer to California Grotesque than Europa Grotesque and, the weight as being somewhere between California Grotesque Bold and California Grotesque Black.
Blend the two weights, edit the central portion of the _S_ diagonal to make it horizontal, drop the center line on _P_, open the space between the terminals on _C_ and you pretty well have what you want, what you really really want :) for the logo.
A similar process might also work for the other letters shown in the sample.
The track listing on the Spice Girls CD http://lonestarspice.com/singles/suyluscd.JPG does not match the logo or the subheadings text in the posted sample, but does seem to match the smaller sized text. Note the diagonal on _S_ and sloped center strokes on _s_ and _a_ which are in the style of Europa.
The appropriate lowercase for a font matching the logo is pure speculation. IMO the Tempor model is more appropriate than Europa for letters such as _s_ and _a_.
