body: Hi! <BR> <BR>I need some help with understanding the &#34;relationship&#34;
  &#40;for the lack of a better word&#41; between italics, small caps, and swash caps.
  It seems not very common for fonts to come with italic small caps, so I suppose
  this means they&#39;re not frequently used. But if italics is to be used for a phrase
  that normally includes small caps, how is this normally resolved? By just using
  normal italic caps instead? Mechanical italic small caps? Or is it the best to choose
  a font that contains optical italic small caps? This is my main question, but it
  also leads me to wonder &#40;out of curiosity&#41;, how is it common to deal with
  this issue if italic swash caps are used? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Torgeir

  body: Torgeir, I gather the limitations on fonts were the amount of glyphs it could
    hold. Thus some designers either left out true small caps and things like old
    style numbers. The reason I bring this up is with Open Type that will change.
    The amount of glyphs an Open Type font can support is huge. So look for OT on
    future purchaces of typefaces.  <BR> <BR>As for Swash Caps they are ment to be
    used sparingly. I also use Small Caps sparingly. For body text its Roman. For
    emphsis its Italic.

  body: I don&#39;t know if glyph amount limitation has been the cause, there are
    often separate fonts for small caps &#40;and text figures&#41;. But maybe Open
    Type will change the situation either way. <BR> <BR>My understanding of small
    caps is that they&#39;re used for e.g. initialisms &#40;if that&#39;s what you
    mean by sparingly?&#41;. The problem of italic small caps appeared when I wanted
    to emphasize a phrase/expression containing an initialism, but unless I misunderstand,
    using italic small caps for these rare cases would be prefered?

    big re-release of an older font family in OpenType, you&#39;ll see that these
    things have been added in where they weren&#39;t previously. Avenir NEXT, for
    instance, has italic small caps and old style figures. The old Avenir had neither
    SC nor OSF in any of its weights. <BR> <BR>Often in text, small caps serve a very
    good visual role

  body: I see, I just wasn&#39;t sure since some fonts &#40;e.g. Minion&#41; have
    italic small caps in the Type 1 version as well. Thanks for clearing it up, and
    both of you for the help!
