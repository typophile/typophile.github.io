  fonts are from an online game. I've been told the last is Aktiv Grotesk but the
  numbers aren't quite the same.\r\nThank you."

    would probably to check the code... What's the online game you're referring to?

  body: "I thought about that but the first picture is from 2006-2007 and the other
    2007-2008, nowadays it's a different font.\r\nWhat bugs me in the first picture
    is that little black area surrounding the letters that I don't know if it's made
    by the game or it's the font itself. And in the second picture the number 3 is
    always different to the fonts search engines suggested."
