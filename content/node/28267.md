  body: Although we all had the information, the announcement was limited to the Adobe
    FDK Forum because Read Roberts wanted to make sure there were no "crash-and burn
    stories" over the weekend, for the majority of people. A wider announcement was
    planned for Monday, but Paul blew up Read's plans. That's fine. No major harm
    done.
