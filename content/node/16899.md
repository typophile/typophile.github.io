    But there might be something similar out there."

  body: "I agree with Lex that this was probably hand-drawn. The Curious George logo
    is a registered trademark of Houghton Mifflin Company publishers now. That would
    lead me to believe if there is a typeface, it is custom (based off the original
    illustration) and proprietary. \r\n\r\nHowever, with the <a href=\"http://www.curiousgeorgemovie.com\">new
    movie</a> coming out next year (and the <a href=\"http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/cgsite/\">number
    of books</a> over the years) there might be something floating around out there
    that is similar / a knock-off. "

  body: "Well, for the movie it could very well just be a redrawn graphic of the original...
    not an entire font. The typeface used in the trailer for names is a different
    face than the title/logo.\r\n\r\nWe'll keep trying for suggestions of similar
    faces."

    Script</a> has similarities, but definitely not the gothic caps you're looking
    for.
