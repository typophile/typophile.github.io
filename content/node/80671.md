  body: It was just a hunch. All those contextual alternates, and then two identical
    commas! ;-)

    this will slow down the instantaneous \"Not a font\" and the snotty \"What makes

  body: I think a way of better guessing if its a font versus handlettering is to
    first look at connected letters as possible ligatures. If the connections are
    smooth, as in the sample, it could still be ligatures or handlettering. When you
    see unconnected letters along side these smooth ligatures that seem slightly more
    awkward as in the mp, that's a clue that makes me think its likely a font. Even
    having many random versions of alternates will have a tendency to look like a
    font if there isn't some sense that the text flows like a person might write.
