  simple straightforward question:\r\n\r\nA 'book' variant of a font is designed to
  be more effective in a situations where there is heavy or continuous text, as in,
  in a book?\r\n\r\nYes/No/Maybe?\r\n\r\nAre there generic similarities in terms of
  the difference between normal and book variants? For example, is the tracking on
  book variants generally less/more?\r\n\r\nThanks for your drips of knowledge."

  body: "To me a book version should be optimized for a optical size of 9pt. So it
    will work in a range from 7 - 10pt. It should be wider and a bit bolder than the
    common 12pt Design. But some designers and foundrys use the term book in a very
    lax way and made minor changes compared to the 12pt design.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: Most text types are issued without optical sizes, such that a good deal of
    the type's structure is determined by the requirement that it work well enough
    at 9 pt and 96 pt. A book version - not really a weight so much as an optical
    size - should work better at the normal sizes for immersive reading - 10 to 14
    pt, say.

  body: The word BOOK refers to the weight variant and nothing else. Very few typefaces
    have optical sizing. However, that's not to say people aren't working on this.
    More and more you will find DISPLAY, SUBHEAD, TEXT, and CAPTION in PRO versions
    of fonts. In such typefaces as <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/garamond/garamond.html">Adobe
    Garamond Premier Pro</a> and other typefaces, not OT, but their designer's are
    aware of the needs of today's users.

    was some recent debate as to where book should fall in the spectrum. "
