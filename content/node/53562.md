body: "I've worked with commercial engraving and engravers for decades and was under
  the impression that the same die used for engraving with ink can also suffice for
  a nice blind embossing.\r\n\r\nNot so.\r\n\r\nAnd this makes sense, once I think
  it through without assumptions.  \r\n\r\nEngraving on paper was invented to replicate
  the (hand) written word; rather than making multiple copies of a document with pen
  and ink the message is cut BACKWARDS into the surface of a piece of metal (originally
  copper but later steel, zinc and sometimes magnesium.)  The plate (which is thin)
  or die (thick) is inked\u2014the ink wiped clean from the surface retained only
  in the cuts\u2014then paper is pressed onto it by virtue of a \"counter\" (corresponding
  counter form cut from paper, board or a synthetic form)under approximately 2 tons
  of quick force. \r\n\r\nBlind embossing is for decoration so it is usually made
  to look more pronounced.  The die is cut in a similar manner (wither with a burin
  or with acid then touched-up by hand with the burin or graver) but deeper so there
  is more dramatic play of light and shadow.  Good embossing dies are thick, usually
  1/2\" copper for short runs (in the hundreds) and brass for long runs (thousands).\r\n\r\nSo,
  if I were using a grape vine motif the grapes would be nice and round, the vines
  definite.  If I engrave the same motif the modulation of the orbs would be implied
  rather than made to look literal.  In a type application, I might want to blind
  emboss a logo built from 72pt Didot because the thicks and thins would be accentuated.\r\n\r\nThe
  smallest type I ever saw blind embossed was 2 or 4pt.  No joke.  Very subtle.  It
  was used as a background pattern on an invitation.\r\n\r\nI'll post some specimens
  when I go to the other computer.\r\n\r\n  "
