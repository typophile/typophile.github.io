  body: "Tapatio looks like the same font as Slasa Picante -- note for example the
    open bowl P -- but with the A modified to echo the stroke on the P.\r\nThere are
    fonts with the open P, mini-serifs and other features in your image. Including
    Pompei http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/pompei/\r\nand Pona http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografies/pona-display/\r\nDon "
