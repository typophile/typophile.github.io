  the wiki and other references on the web that Toyota states that the Lexus L symbol
  was rendered using a precise mathematical formula.\r\n\r\nCan any experts out their
  give some insight into what they are talking about here regarding \"mathematical
  formula\". Does thay mean they used math to position the L where it ended up, or
  to decide the thickness and form of the lines or its geometry or? \r\n\r\nThinking
  about that is there a kind of automation software that can give you / spit out various
  versions of relationships of vectors based on formula or something?\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be great"

    cave wall- it can only ever be mathematical, specifically probably bezier curves.
    Ergo: marketing drivel.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
