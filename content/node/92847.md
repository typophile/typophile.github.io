  post, thanks in advance.  Looking for the font that this \"Rose Tena\" yacht name
  is made of.  The image above came from a photograph, I cut it out of the photo and
  straightened it so it was vertical.  The yacht is in the Midwest region of the USA.
  \ The lettering was applied with vinyl decals, and I would venture to say that it
  was done within the last 10 years.  The unique part about this font is the \"T\".
  \ If we can identify that, I believe the rest of the font will follow.  It feels
  like it has a spanish, or latin flair to me.  Your help is greatly appreciated,
  as I have been tasked to use this particular font on another project.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\nTLathropID"

  body: The Altra is close, especially the Altra Heavy or Altra Black.  But still
    not perfect, the S in the logo has less white space, and the R and A in the logo
    stay pointy rather than getting cut off on the thicker Altra versions.  Do you
    think it's a knockoff, or were the letters modified?  It might be able to pass
    if there aren't any other options.

  body: "The description reads: <blockquote>Altra is a family based on a tracing of
    an old clip art font.</blockquote>\r\nSo it\u2019s possible that the vinyl letters
    came from the original source.\r\nI think that fiddling with the Heavy weight
    (horizontal scaling, maybe an outer stroke) could bring you pretty close."
