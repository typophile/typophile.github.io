  house, had a kid-- forums were the first thing to get cut. I guess I was never super
  active here, but nevertheless I'm glad my account is still around. I still think
  of this as the premiere place to talk about type.\r\n\r\nI work at the Chicago Humanities
  Festival, and we just posted a video of a presentation by Chicago designer Jason
  Pickleman. He's created identities and branding for some great restaurants and cultural
  organizations here in Chicago.  \r\n\r\nHis talk covers three areas: \r\n<ul><li>A
  philosophical look at the role of text and type in our lives</li>\r\n<li>A look
  inside his own creative process</li>\r\n<li>(My personal favorite) A biting critique
  of trends in Chicago signage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIt's about 45 minutes long, and
  you can watch it [[http://youtu.be/hQuUJ63O8mY|on youtube]].\r\n\r\nWe'd love your
  feedback, especially if you were willing to share it as YouTube comments (comments
  are part of how we measure success in getting our content online). \r\n\r\nHope
  all is well in Typophile land.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt Heinrich"
