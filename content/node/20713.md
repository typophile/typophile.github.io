body: "I have always struggled with the names of specific fonts and type designers,
  as I am sure many others have. Doing a search here, I came up with a few threads
  that were of good reference, but none that were specifically attributed to this
  subject alone. So, here, we can clarify once and for all those cumbersome pronunciations
  so that I for one won't ever say Benguiat incorrectly ever again.\r\n\r\nSome of
  the below I am including for the greater good, and some I am including because I
  am honestly unclear on the correct way to say the name. Hopefully, everyone else
  will contribute their own key's to the difficult pronunciations as well. I think
  that the best way to do this would be to play the phonics game, spell out the sounds?
  Right? if not, someone else can make that decision.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I was thinking
  that this could be included into the Typowiki somehow. Obviously it would be best
  to have the information included under the specific articles for the designers,
  but, maybe there should also be a commonly mispronounced typeface/designer article
  as well?\r\n\r\nTypefaces:\r\n\r\nBelwe\r\nBenguiat\r\nCaecillia\r\nCheltenham\r\nCochin\r\nDidot\r\nHiroshige\r\nHoefler\r\n\r\n\r\nType
  Designers:\r\n\r\nEdward Beguiat\r\nCharles Nicholas Cochin\r\nFirmin  Didot\r\nTobias

  body: "> <em>Benquiat - Ben-goo-at</em>\r\n\r\nEEEK!\r\nIt's BEN-gat, unless you
    are a Spaniard, then it's BEN-gee-YAT!\r\n\r\nThe threads listed by Tim D cover
    a lot of previous discussions.\r\nThe problem you will have with pronunication
    is that many typefaces were named after actual people and places... something
    that always gets confused in pronunciation depending on the language it is spoken
    in.\r\n\r\nKey points to consider would be --\r\n\r\nIf it's the name of the person,
    it should be pronounced the way that person (or those who knew that person) would
    say it.\r\n(Like the old Monty Python skit-- \"It's spelled Luxury Yacht, but
    it's pronounced Throatwarbler Mangrove.\")\r\n\r\nIf it's named after a place,
    then it's based on the designer's pronunciation, <em>n'est pas</em>?\r\nExample:
    Depending on whether the designer is from NYC or Lyon, typefaces named \"France\"
    \"Nice\" \"Paris\" would all sound different.\r\n\r\nEach language has it's own
    way of inflecting and pronouncing, so does that mean that \"Frutiger\" and \"Univers\"
    is pronounced wrong in a majority of the world languages?\r\n\r\nFor the most
    part, I think many of us do NOT want to sound like idiots, especially when speaking
    with learned or experienced type directors and designers. The thing is, even when
    you listen carefully at International conferences, pronunciations vary slightly.\r\n\r\nI'm
    surprised you didn't have \"Lubalin\" in the topic thread list.\r\n"

    fact, you can pronounce Univers as you like, they specifically chose a name that
    is pronouncable in many languages, instead of \"Monde\" as it was proposed by
    Frutiger. After all, Univers was meant to be a \"typeface for all people and all
    times\" (or similar). This is also the reason why they introduced the numbers
    system: They only needed packaging and price lists in one language, which the
    French would read as \"Univers cinquante-cinq\", the English as \"Univers fity-five\"
    and so on."
