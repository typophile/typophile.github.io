body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate some advice. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a
  strong business like sans serif with personality to use throughout a travel website.
  It will be for the company tagline. Client wants something that is business like
  without being too corporate. I'd looked at Proxima Nova and Rooney web - is there
  something between these two that might work?\r\n\r\nHelp me Typophile, you're my
  only hope. Any thoughts much appreciated. \r\n\r\nOh they need to support latin
  language character set and serveable via Fontdeck, Typekit or similar.\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Matt"
