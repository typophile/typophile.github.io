  for a company... \r\nIt is supposed to be paired with a mark, so i am trying to
  keep it subtle, while still having some features on it. \r\n\r\nThe typeface is
  a heavily customised Eurostile LT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typeface_5484.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would love to hear your views on it. And some opinions on how this could be improved.\r\n\r\nI
  am especially doubting on the e,c and w...\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: "Not sure about the terminals on \"e\" and \"c\" either. <a href=\"http://fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cocon_1_ot/\">FF
    Cocon</a> could be interesting to look at in terms of how these pointy terminals
    (which otherwise often are \"brushy\") can function with a pretty rigid/geometric
    construction.\r\n\r\nAlso: that's a tiny image. Any way you could upload a PDF?"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys. Really useful. Confirmed some of my own thoughts.
    \r\n\r\nAltaira: Cocon is great, But i am looking for a little more geometric
    construction, to give it a more corporate feel.  (Could't upload PDF, but tried
    a larger .jpeg)\r\n\r\nhola: Thanks for the input. I am aware of that, but since
    dynamic, energetic and forward-thinking are some of the keywords representing
    the brand, i am going for a more powerful \"cow\", and if it ends up looking like
    a bull, it is not all that bad. \r\n\r\n\r\nWell. I've tried to make some improvements,
    listining to your advice, here is the result(s)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/456123_6236.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
    any of theese come out on top? Personally i am leaning toward solution 4 and 5.
    \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "If this type is not going to be used for setting arbitrary text, then #5,
    but with /e/s lower stroke extended further to the right (i.e take the width from
    #1 and the shape from #5). #5 looks the best when the above image scaled down
    to 30%.\r\n\r\nIf it <em>is</em> going to be used more widely that just for the
    logo, then I think wider /r/ is a better option.\r\n\r\nThough now the shape of
    /c/ is inconsistent with that of /p/, which is something that is pretty evident
    on a scaled down version."

  body: "Oh, I didn't mean for you to *use* Cocon \u2013 more like look at the execution,
    study how it solves the connections of the pointy ends and the monoline \"bodies\".
    \r\nIF you're doing the pointy terminals that is (so #1 above). Because they seem
    to have a slight problem with how the inner and outer curves relate.\r\n\r\nPDF:
    You'd have to attach it to the first post in the thread."

  body: "#5 here as well. Although the 'c' now needs to shove closer to the 'ow' pair.
    And yes, the 'p's are too rigid. The outside bottom part of the bowl joins the
    stem too squarely. It needs to curve upward to follow the path of its counterpart
    on the inside of the bowl.\r\n\r\npenn"
