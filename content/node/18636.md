  body: "Are you thinking this is a border design from a font set? I looked through
    all of them shown in the back of the 'Big Yellow' (FontBook), and didn't see anything
    with quite this degree of filigree to it. A couple of the Agfa-Monotype Ornaments
    fonts were sort of similar like Arabesque and Borders & Ornaments 3. The Lanston
    Fleurons sets were also a bit like this, but no matches. I have to believe there
    are other ways that things like this are produced without using fonts.\r\n\r\n-

    image) for this poster i'm designing, so this post caught my eye. \r\nalas...
    i haven't seen a border font as detailed as your image either... but for what
    it's worth, i'm using 'baroque ornaments' for mine.  (storm type)"

    body: I found the first one in this last set in a book called Handbook of Early
      Advertising Art" by Clarence Hornung (pge 300). Chances are they are scans.
      If you'd like I could scan it for you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0815.jpg]

    thing. You might check their website if you'd like the whole shooting match of
    these decorations.
