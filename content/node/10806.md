body: Not to distract too much from the other quizzes going on, I thought this might
  be fun as a serial pop quiz. Like the others, the person who ids correctly gets
  to post the next id. The point of this id quiz is to show a detail of one character
  and see who can correctly identify both the letter and the typeface. Given that
  it&#39;s only a detail, I think WhatTheFont will be baffled; ergo, you gotta know
  it to id it. This is probably an easy one, but I thought I&#39;d get the ball rolling.

  <BR> <BR>In other news, I miss Yves. But he&#39;s on a break, so you up-and-comers
  have a good shot at it.

  body: 'Ha! Yes, no offense to the estimable John Hudson, but I draw no distinction
    between admitted guesses and unadmitted guesses. It&#39;s kind of like the fundamentalist-Christian
    friend I had in high school who, every time he wanted to cuss, said, &#34;Bleepity-bleep-bleep-bleep.&#34;
    &#40;This was before <i>The Simpsons</i>, mind you.&#41; I used to respond, &#34;Dwayne,
    you know the actual cuss words are floating around in your head. You think God
    only hears what you actually say?&#34; <BR> <BR>Since we&#39;re all here to share
    and learn from each other, we have to make guesses and sometimes be wrong; otherwise,
    we&#39;re not learning anything. Better to admit the guess than to pretend to
    knowledge one doesn&#39;t have, no? <BR> <BR>So the long answer to your short
    question is: yes, all guesses are welcome. The more the merrier.'
