    Here in the background, black and white, is the Nike Witness. In blue, at 87%
    opacity, is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/stymie/bold/\">Bitstream
    Stymie Bold</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BitstreamStymie_5117.jpg]\r\n\r\n[edit]
    PS. Comparing a text written white on black to one written black on white is tricky,
    because of optical illusions."
