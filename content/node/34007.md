  body: "How small? If it's really tiny, you might want to consider a pixel font.
    Especially, if it's going to be read on screen.\r\n\r\nHere a nice list of foundries

  body: "Thanks all for the replies.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that this tiny type is going
    to be optimized as image \u2014yes, I know the best would be to do it as HTML.\r\n\r\nI
    noticed that Univers in very small sizes 9 pt roman using sharp is very readable
    but I find the typeface very cold. (eventough at that size might not matter)\r\nI
    would like to find another one...that maybe goes well with Bembo or Bodoni.\r\n\r\nHrant:
    I would prefer b&w.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your thoughts\r\n\r\npatty"

  body: "As you seem to suspect, you're not going to get a lot of \"warmth\"\r\nat
    9 pt (which if you're on a Mac is 9 PPEM) especially in b&w.\r\nAnd there's nowhere
    near enough resolution to try to match this\r\nor that outline font...\r\n\r\nIf
    you're sure you don't want anti-aliasing* then there's a website\r\nthat lets
    you fool with all kinds of settings and shows you comparisons\r\nof bitmap font
