  they are going to be used in my portfolio for my junior review, and my combination
  now doesn''t feel right.. (gotham/universe). im trying to avoid futura and century
  gothic just because of their common appearance in my work. and no helvetica... '

    for two Sans with similar interior shapes. That should downplay the boredom. But
    play with color, weight, texture, harmony and movement!\r\n\r\nSorry but I thought
    maybe you were open to suggestion as opposed to what you think the teacher expects
    or what has been jammed down your throat.  If SANS is the end all then I am way
    too far gone. Serif, on its face, is not a riot! Especially if it is gently paired
    with a Sans. See Bringhurst!\r\n\r\nDuh da ta duh duh ta duh da duh da duh da,
    God save the serif! And its ability to make the Sans sparkle.\r\n\r\nThirty years
    is enough. I am going into the recycling business. \r\n\r\nSerifs for a tuppence
    (sp.)\r\n\r\nMore please!"

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\neveryone is right: pairing two sans is not really subtle, most
    of the time, its just plain wrong. the best you can do is pairing two styles from
    the same sans type: gotham thin with gotham ultra black, helvetica narrow with
    helvetica neue light extended... otherwise, duh, dunno. maybe a humanistic sans
    for the text (gill sans, cronos, bliss...) and a large, capital sans for the titles,
    such as gotham or houschka or... well, really, it doesnt sound like a good idea.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "The trick to mixing sans faces is to make sure that the audience thinks you\u2019re
    a smart designer using two good and distinct typefaces and not one crappy free
    typeface that doesn\u2019t match across fonts. For example, Gotham and Univers
    could work provided that you were mixing the wider weights of one with the condensed
    weights of the other. Or as Nick has pointed out, go bonkers and get the \u201CI
    can\u2019t afford type so I cut it out of magazines\u201D look. "

  body: One way to do it that works is to use them at different sizes--one for text,
    one for headlines, for example. This is a just another way of introducing contrast
    (which, as others have pointed out, is a good thing).
