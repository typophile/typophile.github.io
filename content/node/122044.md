body: Hi there, I've having trouble figuring this one out (the sans, I know the italic
  is Cooper Black Italic). It's not Helvetica, or Akzidenz, or Univers. The t, a,
  y don't match. I think it might be a PLINC face, but the catalog I have doesn't
  show the whole alphabet for comparison. Then again it's a little stretched-out looking.
  Any ideas? Thanks. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/10869493_10153741422929368_3354803671837947311_o_4769.jpg]

  body: I think you're right. And I agree, Font Bureau definitely has a better rep.
    Thank you very much!

  body: "The font used on the album is a Photo-Lettering Inc. font called Improvenu
    Wide 9.  I have not seen any digital version other than the one by OPTI, so the
    OPTI font seems to be an original digital creation. But there are legal issues
    if any OPTI font is used for commercial purposes because OPTI is defunct and its
    fonts are orphans without known legal owners.\r\nDon"
