  body: I'm not exactly sure how having citizens who designed free fonts listed on
    Luc Devroye's site makes Brazil overrepresented. By that logic the USA has churned
    out an absurdly large number of type designers, and with a population of only
    300 million, that makes the USA extremely overrepresented.

  body: "Type design is such a niche occupation/hobby that any national over/under
    representation is probably just statistical noise. Although I think these country
    threads are often a bit silly (like this one http://typophile.com/node/15466).
    I think you can say that there are a few factors that influence the type-designer
    population and visibility in a given country...\r\n\r\n1. A thriving graphic culture
    - I think Brazil has that. \r\n2. Relatively simple writing systems (so you can
    churn out fonts quickly using free or cheap tools) - Brazil has the edge over
    China and India there. \r\n3. A DIY culture that says make it yourself rather
    than buy it off-the-shelf\r\n4. High levels of internet usage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
