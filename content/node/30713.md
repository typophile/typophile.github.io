  ended up with a Futura Bold based logo and I am finding it hard to find a good <strong>serif</strong>
  based companion typeface for use on his business cards etc.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nDemetre"

  body: Why not just stick with Futura if you're looking for a sans. It's not always
    a good idea to pair more than one sans. Futura can be hard to read for long texts
    but for business card/letterhead type it should be OK. Alternately, perhaps try
    a serif?

  body: "Looks like I made a mistake when posting this. I actually meant to put that
    I was looking for a serif typeface to contrast the sans. \r\n\r\nI was told by
    a friend to investigate some serifs that originated around the same time as Futura
    but I'm not sure if that's the way to go with a more modern looking logo.\r\n\r\nAny
    \"serif\" suggestions?"
