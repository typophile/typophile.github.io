  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>[[http://www.londonelects.org.uk/pdf/2008%20Candidates%20booklet.pdf|This leaflet (pdf)]] arrived through my door this morning. After reading the posts about the American Presidential elections and their design, I was a bit stunned about how bad all of these are. For instance, why didn&rsquo;t they justify the text (set in tight columns) on Left List candidate&rsquo;s page; why did Siân Berry&rsquo;s team choice a typeface with such an ugly â; and why are there so many letter collisions on Matt O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s page (this seems to be less obvious with the PDF)? I&rsquo;m also a bit surprised that Brian Paddick chose UKIP&rsquo;s colours (purple and yellow) for his campaign, but I suppose that would be less noticeable if they were not on adjacent pages. The most scary thing, however, is that picture of Ken Livingstone. In print, it looks like it was taken with a fish-eye lens!</p>
<p>Considering the amount the main candidates are spending, you would have though that they could have done better!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hehe. Mine plopped through the door the other day. It&rsquo;s possibly the most entertaining piece of post I&rsquo;ve received in a long time. I thought more or less everything you thought, though I take no issue with Ken&rsquo;s portrait, which I think is better than all the others bar Siân&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m amazed by the Lib Dems to the extent that I feel like writing to them. A lot of them seem to have opted for purple. I wonder why?</p>
<p>And the Conservatives have snuck through a re-brand without my noticing before. A green scribbly tree replaces the Tory torch. A green Tory tree? What horseshit!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is the barly shrouded racism in the content of the BNP, UKIP and the anti-mosque Christian Choice candidate. In all what a terrible advert for London. The fact they mailed the entire electoral register with this booklet is pretty poor too. There are three voters in my house. One appallingly designed leaflet between us would have done.</p>

<p>It could be worse—you could have the whole world scrutinizing your elections the way they do ours. If mainstream American parties sent this kind of stuff out in New York City it would light a fire under the ass of every politico around the globe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was reading the first two pages and wondering what all the fuss was; I quite liked the style and the design and the font.</p>
<p>Then came page three. Oh dear. The colours. The Arial. The Times New bloody Roman.</p>
<p>I rather liked the Conservative one, it’s clean and unobtrusive. The Liberal Democrats’ designer should be defenestrated. The Christian Choice one first made me cringe at the disgusting purple gradient background; then I guffawed mirthfully at the expression on the kid’s face; and then I wondered what kind of Christian politician chooses to boldly parade the fact that he’s old enough to be his wife’s father. And Ken Livingstone just looks creepy. No, I don’t want a lollipop.</p>
<p>Ah, thank God. Back to proper design with typographic hierarchies, relatively acceptable colour schemes, and overall lack of choroidal incinerations.</p>
<p>I like my “Junk mail—no thanks!” sign.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The tree was one of David &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; Cameron&rsquo;s first changes after he took over. I believe it is supposed to be an English (or should that be British?) oak. I seem to remember that they were toying with a less scribbled one for a while, which looked a lot a better than the current one. Incidentally, has anyone else noticed how small the Labour logo is on Ken&rsquo;s page?</p>
<p>The problem with the Tory one is that is looks rubbish in print. The leaflet is published in a booklet with each candidate&rsquo;s page folded in half so the important information really needs to be on the left page for maximum effect. Scanning through it, I missed all of his policies. I get the impression they only printed it onto flat A4 and didn&rsquo;t think of it as a page in a booklet.</p>

<p>Yes. Same with the Liberal Democrats’ logo—it took me several seconds of eyes roaming the page to even locate it and find out what party it was.</p>
