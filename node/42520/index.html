<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Just been reading the <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/42351>Avenir & Gotham</a> debate initially posted by David Rault and it got me thinking...
In both commercial aircraft design (and car design to an extent), there seems to be a form to which major manufacturers defer to in terms of 'what is most efficient'. As I understand it, a certain deviation from this 'ideal', the stylised tailfin for Boeing's Dreamliner, had the undesired effect of making the plane less efficient. As time has gone on, all commercial planes have begun to look increasingly alike (not helped by the number of manufacturers steadily having being whittled down). In an attempt to look different, the Dreamliners's fuel-efficiency has taken a hit...
If we assume that the market one is trying to hit is sans serif fonts for immersive reading (for which someone incidentally said Gotham was not as efficient as Avenir), is it fair to say that there is an inevitability as time goes on that the best sans serif typefaces designed for large areas of copy will, like the planes at the airport, begin to look more or less the same and have less and less distinguishing characteristics, and that any deviation from the optimum design will result in a move away from efficiency/readablility?
What in your opinion is the current best performing sans serif for immersive reading? Is this <em>the</em> optimum sans serif for immersive reading? If not, what is wrong with it?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>A lot of people, including me, think that no sans is optimal for extended text--an excellent serif is better for extended reading than any sans. I think sans have inherent problems connected with spacing and leading which means they lose out to serifs for this use, though not for other uses--display, short text.
That being said, I think the demands of functionality for extended text do push toward a fairly narrow range on weight and width of characters--both for serifs and sans. That still leaves room for stylistic variation, but within a limited range. Erik Spiekermann said something like: a good typeface can only vary by 5% from other good typefaces. I think he was talking about types suitable for text there.
I think that narrower sans, based on the oval rather than the circle, are inherently more readable in text. So Meta is more functional than Helvetica for text. PDFs of Gerard Unger's Vesta convinced me that it is one of the best sans for longer texts. He doesn't have up the ones I saw earlier, but [[http://www.gerardunger.com/pdf/vesta.pdf|this]] will give you a taste.
I'm sure flared sans like Carl Crossgrove's Beorcana or will perform very well also, but they are 'cheating' because they have a bit of serif in them. Similarly Angie sans and Optima will do well, but also 'cheat'.

<div class=commentbody>i know this isn't technically about reading extended text, but I recently did a test of a number of different typefaces with the congregation of my local church congregation on overhead transparencies with worship song lyrics... i used a number of typefaces, including georgia, minion, myriad, officina (sans and serif, various weights) and helvetica round... in a number of different letter spacings
by far the favourite typeface was officina sans bold, set slightly loose
people especially liked the fact that the italic was easily differentiated and still legible
me, i preferred myriad, but that could well be down to the fact that i use it a lot
the only typeface that was universally disliked was georgia... they thought it was 'old-fashioned'

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Your question is complicated; you make the comparison between airplanes and typefaces, which is pretty apt. One good metaphor for type is shoes; are they stylish yet uncomfortable, or are they sensible and trustworthy for long hikes? One gives a visual effect, one will carry you long distances.
You use a term that might not be what aviation or type designers would use. "Effficient" implies that the object does the most work, fastest or with least effort. The issue with real immersive reading, (which is not what you are doing looking at a coffee-table book or magazine) is comfort, ease, smoothness and transparency of form; you want to take in the author's ideas without being distracted or hindered by noticing the type, and you want to be free to connect with the ideas or story for possibly hours at a time. A "page-turner" will keep you fascinated right to the end, and if set in a comfortable typeface, you won't ever notice how the page looks, and you won't ever be bothered by a certain letter or by faults in spacing or other layout factors.
All that can be said for many typefaces, but I think it's agreed that niether Gotham nor Avenir is really ideal. They are both very reduced, abstract, monolinear, and modular. They are both expertly-crafted, high-quality, robust typefaces, but for the narrow purpose of long-distance reading, they are not ideal. William has identified one characteristic of good book typefaces that I think is important: Proportion. Narrower sans designs probably feel more comfortable to read because the heavier horizontals of a sans need more vertical space in order to keep from clogging the letterforms. A larger x-height will also help a sans design in this respect.
Here we start to notice different classes of sans type; the geometrics like Futura, Avenir, Gotham and Avant Garde have these reduced, directionless traits. Humanist sans designs like Syntax, Legacy Sans, Mundo, Fresco, Bliss, and Absara all are based on Renaissance roman types, which are recognized as the ideal book typefaces: Bembo, Minion, Dante, Garamond, Galliard, Kingfisher, Laurentian. So they have enough DNA that makes them more comfortable, with similar proportions, directionality, and humanism (hence that name).
You can go beyond this to another variety of sans designs that William mentions: flared, or semi-, or hybrid, or stressed sans designs (awkward, huh?). These sort of inhabit a gray area between sans and serif because they don't have monoline or simplified strokes, they adopt more of the traits of serifed roman types, and they give a very different impression in text than even humanist sans designs. However, they still (usually) don't have serifs. How to classify them?
There is a perception that sans designs can never perform in text as well as serif designs, solely based on the lack of serifs. There hasn't been a really comprehensive, thorough and informed study to tell us once and for all what typefaces really are more comfortable for immersive reading; we'd all like to know. So far, comparisons have been insufficient, inappropriate, or otherwise far from comprehensive. Meanwhile we all give our opinions and rationalize them afterwards.
My personal opinion, borne out somewhat in the design of Beorcana, is that serifs alone aren't as crucial to reading comfort as they have been thought to be. Generally people consider the lack of serifs a deal-killer; like a gentlemen's club; you have to have the appendage to be admitted. ;)
I think this is overly simplistic, and gives insufficient weight to the other traits, proportions and design features of a typeface. Classic book faces have a number of traits that make them comfortable, and I think all of those traits contribute crucial advantage in reading comfort: spacing, stroke contrast, cap/lowercase proportion, serif thickness, serif bracketing, stress, width, weight or color (how dark is the type). Then of course, apart from the type design, there is line spacing, line length, type size, paper and ink color and other layout factors. There are typefaces with serifs that do not have enough of these other traits, and they are very uncomfortable and difficult to read for long. Certain digital cuts of Bodoni are essentially failures as book types, even though the original designs by Bodoni were intended for text. It isn't the serifs that confer readability, it's a whole group of parameters of the typeface's design. What makes a person beautiful? Is it blue eyes alone? Is everyone with brown eyes ugly? Or, more aptly, is a rubber sole on a shoe enough to make it comfortable for long hikes? Or does there also have to be arch support, ventilation, flexibility, soft fabric or leather, durable stitching, and doesn't the shoe have to be the right size and width? Is the toe pinching? Does the heel rub? After about 4 miles, these factors clearly are of equal importance to what the sole is made out of.
Since it is this complex, interdependent constellation of factors that influence how readable a typeface is in text, I think the influence of serifs on overall reading comfort is widely exaggerated.
But one difficulty in this discussion has always been that some people will lump every sans design together as though they belong in a category together: Avant Garde, Versa Sans and Beorcana, because they lack actual serifs, are somehow considered interchangeable. It might be more useful to discuss which type is good for books without the misleading classifications of serif and sans.
As far as "samey", William has hit it; the demands of function on text faces are so many, and so specific, that text faces have been homogenous for quite some time already.
Trends in advertising and graphic design tend to draw out similar designs; there was a burst of geometric sans designs all at the same time in the earlier 20th century, and it was driven to a large extent by fashion. It's the style of now, the latest thing. The trend, or pervasive qualities I see in sans designs now are what I call the Info sans, which Erik Spiekermann has almost singlehandedly launched; slightly condensed, somewhat humanist, monospaced-feeling, sensible sans designs without a lot of character, possibly somewhat square. [[http://www.typophile.com/node/28458|See this thread]] for a rundown (not all relevant faces are even shown).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I unfortunately have no time at the moment to discuss this topic with the attention it deserves, but I just want to say that for me, there is no such thing as immersive reading with a sans. a flare, maybe; I experienced some pretty good reading using cronos or optima, but it doesnt come close to the comfort of baskerville or garamond. someone said that serifs are not that crucial to immersive reading as it was tought to be: try to read a 300 pages novel composed in 10 pt. gotham or ff meta, then. good luck with the headache.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your comments, esp Bill and Carl.
>While corporate liners are somewhat similar, the Airbus and Dreamliner are nothing alike in appearance, aren’t they?
In order to move away from the 'standard' in airplane design (particularly in the tailfin area), the resulting Boeing 787 Dreamliner design was less 'eco-friendly', as I understand it. Can the same be said for typefaces (particularly sans) for immersive reading? i.e if one makes a typeface more distinctive will it not be as good at its job? Is there a ceiling which we have just about reached as to just how readable a typeface can be?
When was the last major breakthrough with typeface readability? If it was in the fifteenth or even late nineteenth century, then shouldn't we all give this self-indulgence up as a bad job? After all, what real value is there in expressing oneself if our end product is no better? (I don't really think that btw, or at least I don't think I do! I'm just trying to find out if anyone really believes in what we/they are doing?)
To elaborate a little on my original post up top, is there no point in trying to make a more readable sans serif when serif faces are better at the job? Is that defeatist or am I simply being a realist?
Or, and this for me is the ultimate typographic question, can the current ceiling for (readable) sans serifs be blown away*? i.e. am I wasting my time trying to design a sans serif that reads better than what's gone before? Am I kidding myself that this is possible for anyone, never mind me?
>try to read a 300 pages novel composed in 10 pt. gotham or ff meta, then. good luck with the headache.
Granted, but have you tried to read a novel in Beorcana? Or is Beorcana just <em>Carl's interpretation or opinion of sans serif readability</em> or <em><b>is there an objective yardstick of perfection that he has moved closer to?</b></em>
* I think Beorcana hit that ceiling pretty hard if it didn't actually blow it away. I like it a lot.

<div class=commentbody><em>When was the last major breakthrough with typeface readability?</em>
Yesterday.
The world changes every day. Readability is a moving target.
**
Dan, the ClearType faces have a consistent look for several reasons. As I see it:
Firstly, there is the techno groove, something about perpendiculars rendering better than diagonals and curves; verticals better than horizontals.
Secondly, it was a corporate design program, so a degree of homogeneity represents brand, and MS has progressed and become more sophisticated in that respect, when compared with some of its more ad hoc type releases of the past. So this time, stronger directives to the hired hands?
Thirdly, I believe there were some pressures to consistency of glyph shape from the need to conceive of the three major scripts as a whole. Whether this was an overt direction, or just a general mindset, as an outsider I can't say--but I suspect that Jelle Bosma's Cyrillic was found wanting because it didn't toe the party line.
Fourthly, there may have been some orthodoxy caused by readability theory, whether traditional typographic theories, or as a result of tests conducted during the type development.

<div class=commentbody>Those two comments are worth emphasizing; we wouldn't think roman type at 10 point was highly readable if printing and typefounding hadn't allowed the design of type to evolve to this point. Earlier, hand-cut typefaces were considerably less precisely refined and cast, and that looked normal at that point. Along the way, we learned to read best what we were reading most. I think this evolution is still happening, and we continue to adapt what we are comfortable with. Now, that is influenced by reading on computer screens, reading newspapers, reading various-length texts set in sans designs, and simply not reading as much (debatable).
Blackletters were considered the most readable typefaces in a culture that had essentially adapted to them. We also read latin types well because that is the script we learned to read in. Kanji, Arabic and Malayalam aren't harder to read, if you're a native reader. Clearly, seen overall, humans are widely adaptable in their ability to learn to read different script systems, and even within those systems, we adapt. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Clearly, seen overall, humans are widely adaptable in their ability to learn to read different script systems, and even within those systems, we adapt.</em>
We do, yes, but that doesn't preclude the possibility that certain shapes, certain sizes, certain spacing, etc. are more easily read than other shapes, sizes, spacing, etc. Adaptation is bounded in various ways by legibility, ease of distinction between potentially similar forms, i.e. features that underly readability. It is also worth remembering that writing systems were developed in order to be read, which means that they are themselves adapted to our ability to adapt; this makes the whole relationship of readability and what I call readerability complicated and not easily disentangled (presuming one want to disentangle them, which I don't particularly). On the other hand, there are examples of specific styles of writing that were deliberately devised to be difficult to read, either because readability was sacrificed to an overall aesthetic appearance (e.g. Russian v'yaz), or because the scribes found the game of making a puzzle of language irresistable (e.g. Ottoman diwani). Such styles demonstrate that there is more to readability than mere familiarity, and that readerability adapts to certain features better than to others. Those features include consistency of form and distinguishability of individual letters, which is why those features are suppressed in v'yaz and diwani.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some optimum shapes are imposed by physical laws -- aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, for example. On aircraft, the development of delta and swept wings was mostly driven by what was needed to fly at supersonic speeds (of course there are other reasons, such as build simplicity and fuel capacity). Modern submarines look significantly different from WWII subs because their designers studied the shapes of sharks and tuna and other "efficient" underwater swimmers.
Whether anybody has yet defined, in terms and equations that scientists would accept, the physical laws of readability or legibility is outside my BOK. In other words, what would Richard Feynman have thought about relating boumas and saccades and whatnot to readability and legibility?</div>

<div class=commentbody>In planes, wing shape varies quite greatly, with the WWII-shape still being the most efficient at subsonic speeds, while a full delta seems to be the best at the highest speeds, if memory serves.
The dreamliner's whole body looks different from the airbus. The dreamliner is built like a sailfish, while the airbus looks like a whale w/ an oversized forehead. There is also a fair difference between the wings.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, do you have a source on the lowered fuel-effiency on the Boeing due to the wing design?
According to Boeing the plane is 20% more fuel-efficient compared to other jets of similar size flying today. And obviously there was a lot of effort in making a lighter plane out of carbon fiber and titaniun ... so slapping on some stylish wings doesn't seem to fit with one of the main selling points, which is that it's a more efficient plane compared to its only competitor. As an airline executive I'd probably thinking of the millions of dollars lost with that .2% decrease in fuel efficiency or whatever, and not on subtle styling cues as with cars or a typeface.
So far I've found this page which says that [[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/boeing/787/787primer.asp|"the 787-3 will use winglets to decrease the wingspan and improve efficiency over short distances"]] while the 787-8 and 9 will use raked wingtips which are optimal for long-range flights.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Roman, take a look at this article entitled <a href=http://boeingblogs.com/randy/archives/2005/07/shark_fins_and_bullet_trains.html>Shark fins and bullet trains</a>.
. Having read around a little I now realise that the final 'locked-down' design of the 787 Dreamliner is very dull compared to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Boeing787_model_dreamliner-1.png>original concept drawings</a> and that they aren't going to use the stylised sharkfin tail that I make mention of in two of my above posts.
Sorry if I did not make myself clear. First and foremost, I meant the tailfin which was sharklike to begin with, but as the blog above suggests, both the sharkfin tail and the bullet-train nose (as seen in early artists' impressions of the Dreamliner) had to revert for the sake of efficiency. The guy blogging rather disappointingly says, "Now it looks just a like the old plane it replaces." That is exactly what I'm talking about; a radical new design having to be abandoned because it doesn't do the job as well as the current designs.
So my question is; have typefaces (particularly Latin typefaces) to a lesser or greater extent already reached this equilibrium or ceiling, where any change in design, no matter how well-intentioned/executed, actually makes matters worse so you go back to a safer, more robust and proven design?

<div class=commentbody>This is not a good analogy, because the air is a natural and relatively unchanging environment, whereas type exists in a cultural environment that is constantly morphing.

<div class=commentbody>True; while John Hudson has a point that there probably are limits to this dictated by our physiology and psychology, we do adapt and evolve, and the products of our hands (type, books, computers) also evolve. It isn't a constant like air pressure or friction.
It's not established, or even much discussed, whether we have reached the kind of ceiling you mention. It's also hard to imagine that happening, given the changes we've already seen, just in the 20th century.
Nick Job, you can choose how radical or safe your designs are. Everyone doesn't work the same way, and everyone doesn't focus on the same aspects of type. If you think up a rad idea, just try to make it work. The proof is in the results. There ought to be numerous ways that the idea of the text face can be stretched, evolved, or exploded. </div>

<div class=commentbody>>It’s also hard to imagine that happening, given the changes we’ve already seen, just in the 20th century.
I hope you're right. Nevertheless, in recent times a lot of people have done revivals, as if there's nowhere else to go. There may be other reasons for reviving type but, let's face it, mould-breaking originality isn't one of them.
It also occurs to me that the glyphs that come in for most criticism on the Critique section of Typy are nearly always those that 'jar' with the reader, usually because they have departed from the 'normal'/received shape of the glyph in question. I think that the normal shape of letters may be a far more constant 'pressure' for uniformity than Nick S will admit.
>There ought to be numerous ways that the idea of the text face can be stretched, evolved, or exploded.
Stretched or evolved maybe, but do you really believe the idea of the text face can be exploded? That said, Beorcana was some gauntlet to throw down.
>This is not a good analogy.
I realise that. I'm just not very good at thinking of good analogies. It's the best I could come up with to try to illustrate my original question.

<div class=commentbody><em>the normal shape of letters may be a far more constant ’pressure’ for uniformity than Nick S will admit.</em>
Damn right. The pressure for uniformity comes not from the needs or wants of the reading public (surely a diverse bunch!) but from:
-typography professionals who would like to see things done "properly"
-technology which standardizes for the sake of efficiency
-corporations whose products dominate the marketplace
-accessibility standards
-advertisers and publishers who... &c. &c.

When people get the opportunity to break the rules (handwriting, tattooing, email, texting), all hell breaks loose.
<em>I’m just not very good at thinking of good analogies.</em>
Perhaps I shouldn't have said it was a bad analogy, because it was a good analogy, as analogies go. But analogies break down pretty quickly when it comes to type and reading, because the issue is so complex and there's nothing quite like it.</div>

I don't agree. Familiarity with letter shapes is a key to readability. If you make unrecognizable characters it will be very annoying to readers of extended text. So there is an inherent conservatism to type. If you want to be a radical, be a scientist or inventor; that's where radical innovation is highly prized.
One example of the inherent conservatism of type is the non-phonetic spelling of English. It is totally irrational, and a barrier to learning reading, but it sticks around because people are familiar with it. Similarly the keyboard layout, which was designed to *slow* typists down, is still used generally, though it is demonstrably sub-optimal. I think that the roman characters are pretty functional, unlike English spelling and the keyboard, but it just goes to show how conservative these things are.
This doesn't mean that there's not scope for stylistic innovation; this is, but it's just more limited than say in painting in fine arts.
In display type you can of get away with a lot more, of course, depending on the purpose. </div>

Come on now. Don't we see this every day in coffee-table books? Ha ha. Really that has more to do with people not understanding how text faces work.
You notice that there are a lot of people doing revivals. True. I don't think this is new. Every technology brings this, and some old types really are worth keeping around. [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=13|Some aren't as well-known or appreciated as they probably should be.]] Also keep in mind how different type designers have different interests. There are incredibly strong designers who, on examination, stay well within a safe zone of historical models. [[http://www.kimeratype.com/|Other designers experiment more freely and stretch the boundaries, rather than stay within them.]] Some designers approach type design from the outside and are less inclined to follow conventions.
Here's the thing: Dwiggins made some very successful, but somewhat bizarre experiments with his types intended for harsh printing conditions. Matthew Carter used a technique in Bell Centennial that we now see as extreme, but for a particular purpose. Do you think of those as radical? Compared to say, the "madly daring" extreme contrast of Didot and Bodoni, I think they are pretty out there, but always in the service of making text easy to read. Our reading conditions are now very different. We find ourselves reading onscreen more than we might like to admit. What might be done using the current technology and settings that would improve things, but possibly be kind of un-subtle, disturbing, unprecedented, deconstructive, radical? I think there's plenty of area there to explore.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great links, Carl, thanks. I admire you for trying to bring out the radical in all of us. I'm pretty confident that in my case it's not there! And I remain fairly convinced that it has less place in type design now than the relatively microscopic evolution of letterforms over a period of time. Still, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Privatair.hb-iip.b737-700.arp.jpg>crazy blended wingtips on Boeing 737s</a> came from nowhere and seem to do a job so don't let me be in any way a discouragement to anyone who has it in them to do radically different typography, provided I can read it better for longer from further away in less light. Even better if it's a sans serif; I prefer them.</div>

That makes no more sense than saying that the phonetic spelling of German is an example of the inherent dynamism -- or, for that matter, conservatism -- of type. The phonetic or non-phonetic nature of a particular orthography has nothing to do with typographic conservatism. If English spelling were reformed tomorrow to make it phonetic, do you think suddenly typography would be less conservative? Is German typography less conservative than English typography?
English spelling isn't even primarily an example of conservatism in spelling: it's evidence of dynamism in pronunciation. :)</div>

Well I think that you're mistaking my point. I specifically said that there is room for stylistic variation--including innovation--though much greater in display than in text type. My point was simply that you can't be as radical in type as in painting and still serve the reader. When David Carson replaced the letters in an article with Zapf Dingbats he was being more radical than typographers are--but he was ceasing to be a typographer, as he wasn't serving the author or the text. </div>

<div class=commentbody>John, evidently I didn't make myself clear. It is not that phonetic spelling or not is inherently conservative. It is rather that the reluctance to change a dysfunctional system shows conservatism. English spelling puts up an unnecessary barrier that makes it more difficult for children and non-English speakers to learn to read English. Therefore there is a strong reason to reform. But the unfamiliarity of the new to those already trained means a short or medium term cost to change. Hence the current system is conserved even though it is clear that another one, once established, would be superior. The same with the keyboard. That's the conservative bias I was talking about.
I don't think the latin alphabet letter forms are dysfunctional--though they have some problems--but even if they were it would be difficult to change them a lot, and quickly, because of the same conservative bias going on. </div>

The pressures are different--that's my point. In art you have a speculative market that encourages novelty. In science I believe one of the requirements for a PhD is that your research have novel results. And they give the Nobel prize for important novelty.
This is just not the same in type. A good revival may be both more honored and more successful in the market than a good novel face. And, to the point of this thread, there are much stronger pressures for a text fact not to be radical: both from the demands of our visual apparatus and of the conservative demand I have just written about to instantly recognize the characters.
The key thing in type is that it serve the author and publisher. That may involve some novelty for excitement or persuasion, or it may not. Novelty is one value among many. It's just fundamentally different from science. </div>

<div class=commentbody>William: <em>It is rather that the reluctance to change a dysfunctional system shows conservatism.</em>
So you think 'design' and 'designate' should be spelled phonetically and thereby lose the semantic link provided by the root? English spelling is erratic because of the mongrel nature of the language, the influence of multiple regional dialects on received pronunciation, dramatic historical shifts in pronunciation, and the relatively late standardisation of spelling, but the basic notion that spelling should preserve roots is not in itself erratic --indeed, it can be very systematic as in Arabic, which compounds non-phonetic spelling by not writing the vowels --, and it certainly isn't dysfunctional: it simply has a <em>different</em> function. Yes, it presents a challenge for learning to read; on the other hand it provides dividends in understanding what you are reading, and facilitates the play of meaning across and around words that is one of the hallmarks of much English literature. It is a mistake to assume that the primary functional criterion of a good spelling system should be ease of learning to read. Many cultures with many languages around the world have developed and used non-phonetic writing systems because they found them useful. Such systems favour those who have learned to read, rather than those who are in the process of learning, so you may argue that they encourage the existence of a literate elite, but I think this is an access to education issue not a spelling issue.</div>

<div class=commentbody>By the way, Mark Rosenfelder developed a very good analysis of English spelling rules as they relate to pronunciation. The rules are complex, because they describe how the pronunciation of letters changes depending on context, but the changes are systematic, which Rosenfelder demonstrates by using his rules to teach a computer program to anticipate pronunciation based on English spelling.

I don't believe they are, we all operate under the same socio-economic system.
But I don't want to debate to what extent the market for art is speculative, or how much novelty is rewarded in science--suffice it to say that on those issues, as on type, we differ!
So let's talk about type.
<em>there are much stronger pressures for a text fact not to be radical</em>
Aren't we talking at cross purposes?
I'm talking about the cultural pressures that produce uniformity in typography, whereas you're talking about how "radical" faces won't catch on because they're too hard to read--a circular argument if ever there was one, because if a face catches on, obviously it's not radical!
How do you explain, according to your theory, how Futura ever became established, and in such a hurry? At the time, typography had just experienced 30 years of near total historicism--old-style serif faces everywhere. Surely people would have found it impossible to read?! Yes, I know, book typography is the only true immersive reading...

John, I think this is really a stretch. I am very literate and I don't know whether 'should' is spelled that way because of its Saxon origin or whatever, and how that silent 'l' is related to antique conjugation or whatever. Also as anyone reads, once they have learned to read, spelling is largely irrelevant unless the word is unfamiliar. In Chinese, where the addition time to learn reading is multiplied many fold, there is indeed much more of a semantic pay-off in knowing what character represents what sound. But not in English.
>How do you explain, according to your theory, how Futura ever became established, and in such a hurry?
Hurry? How about at least 100 years? In the 1830 commercial sans began to be manufactured and used. And these had ancient roots, and were used in signage long before. That's reflected in the French name for sans, "antique". And Johnston's sans was all over London well over a decade before. And the letter forms never presented a problem to legibility, as they had long been present in hand lettering, I believe. In Futura, the one story a, for example, was in italic and hand writing all along. And the radical form of the g was rejected.
The main change that the Germans made, and it was the biggest change in type in the past hundred years, was to use sans in extended text. Still, even that took specific, larger social pressures to happen. Many Germans, particularly on the left, wanted to be more a part of Enlightenment Europe. They were used to reading roman, blackletter, and sans. I think that going for extensive use of sans was a way to get away from black letter without simply following the rest of Europe and being accused of betraying specific German roots. --They were departing from both German custom and the rest of Europe.
So the change, though the biggest, was simply in usage, and not the introduction of new letter forms.
And it took extraordinary changes in society, as well as talented designers doing visually exciting things, to make even this change.
In our time, I see the main pressures as being technological, rather than social. The introduction of digital type, the need for low-resolution screen fonts, etc. The only real potential for big typographic change is globalization. But here, the pressures seem to have mainly been to 'romanize' non-latin scripts, rather than to affect latin letter forms.
>a circular argument if ever there was one, because if a face catches on, obviously it’s not radical!
No, that circularity is only in your head. You can check whether the letter forms were present earlier, and whether people reported difficulty reading them. That would constitute radical change, and historically changes in letter forms just seem to happen rarely and in small steps. Unlike in science where we've had real revolutions.

<div class=commentbody>William: <em>I am very literate and I don’t know whether ’should’ is spelled that way because of its Saxon origin or whatever, and how that silent ’l’ is related to antique conjugation or whatever.</em>
(Currently) monosyllablic words of Old English (Germanic, Anglo-Saxon) origin are not always the best examples of the value of root-signifier retention in spelling, but in this case you've picked a good one, because it is the presence of the l that maintains the relationship of should/shall, <em>sceolde</em> the past tense of <em>sceal,</em> as it does for would/will. The fact that should retains the sense of obligation that modern usage has largely dropped from shall, yet preserving the orthographic relationship despite changes in pronunciation, is a helpful reminder of earlier usage of shall, which is important if one actually reads literature that is more than fifty years old.
As Mark Rosenfelder and others have demonstrated, English spelling is, in fact, very largely phonetic: it's just that a) the rules are complex and b) they favour determination of pronunciation from spelling rather than the other way round. So let's make a distinction between complex phonetic spelling and simple phonetic spelling. In the latter, there is an effort to provide a single mechanism to record each sound of spoken language (with the caveats that the mechanisms may involve digraphs or accents, and the sounds may be compound, i.e. not pure phonemes; some native American orthographies have close to perfect phonetic representation, since they were invented by linguists, and they tend to be typographical nightmares).
What would be the implications of a simple phonetic spelling for English?
Well, we'd almost certainly end up needing more vowel letters, so probably some diacritic accents or more and better regularised diphthongs. Picking up on your example above, how would we spell 'would'? 'Wood'? Is that useful? And of course 'wood' doesn't rhyme with 'snood', so maybe both 'would' and 'wood' should be 'woud', or perhaps 'wūd'? Either way, having two words of different meaning with the same spelling is one of the complaints already leveled against English, so what have you gained while losing the etymological relationship of would/will?
Going back to my earlier example regarding retention of roots, what should (shūd?) we do about 'design', 'designate', 'sign' and 'signature'? Presuming even a Websterian approach to phonetic spelling, itself far from a truly simple phonetic system, we end up with 'dezine', 'dezignate', 'sine' and 'signatyur'. The common Latin root, which has survived intact through divers paths of Mediaeval Latin, Old French and Mediaeval French -- survived intact despite changes in the pronunciation of all those intermediate languages -- is thereby lost.
William, my intent here is not to argue that English spelling is wonderful or that it is not, as you say, a challenge to those learning to read -- perhaps especially to second-language learners --, but that you mischaracterise the reasons for its retention when you cite it as an example of 'conservatism'. Perhaps this too, though, reflects a specifically modern usage, in which the term conservatism is presumed to reflect an attitude, an inertia of desire that conserves things because it doesn't like change. So I would like to suggest an alternative word: conservationism, which implies, I hope, a recognition that there is something of value in what is conserved.</div>

Yes they are, but that's not what you've been doing.
You have just compared conservatism in the shape of the alphabet, with "real revolutions in science".
The shape of the alphabet is not a field.
Typography is not even a field, in the broad sense that science is, although design might be.
What, in science, is a meaningful parallel to the shape of the alphabet?
Nothing.
Science has the human genome project. We have Unicode.
Science has manufactured diseases. We have Comic Sans.
It's easy to pick and choose similarities and differences, to try to prove a point, but all it ends up doing is creating dispute over whether the comparison is justified, which doesn't help the topic.

Well, I think we would have to look at efforts at spelling reform, and the reception they met to answer that. My feeling is that the word origins in roots are so distant from most people's consciousness that that wouldn't have been an obstacle, but I may be wrong. I enjoy looking up word origins--I also looked up 'should' after I posted--and learn from the process, but that could be done also with reformed spelling. Spelling reform is not an obstacle to that, and the roots are sufficiently far from the origins to require looking up in most cases. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Russell, according to [[http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08300/content.cfm?pub_id=3797&id=2|the data you can download at this site]] the United States' National Science Foundation last year funded 75% basic research and 25% applied research.

Bill, I wasn't questioning your knowledge of science, just pointing out that you weren't comparing different fields (i.e. disciplines), because the shape of the alphabet is not a field--so how can it be compared to science?
You said, "historically changes in letter forms just seem to happen rarely and in small steps. Unlike in science where we’ve had real revolutions."
I don't dispute either half of your sentence, just their connection, which is a bad analogy.
It seems to me that in order to support you argument for conservatism in typographic form, you are saying that alphabetic form is slow to change, therefore typographic form must be slow to change. That is a non sequitur.
No, we have not had revolutions in alphabetic form; but yes, we have had revolutions in typographic form--and Futura/Gill/Kabel c.1930 was surely just such a thing, following thirty years of sustained and near complete serif-based historicism in the graphic arts--historicism which was itself a revolution. I don't deny that every revolution has its precedents, and indeed, as you mention, the new genres of commercial type that emerged in the 1830s were another revolution. Type history is full of revolutions!
You have also argued that because English spelling is complex, therefore typography should not change too fast. That too, as John has explained, is a non sequitur caused by a bad analogy.

<div class=commentbody>>how can it be compared to science?
Just as you can compare anything else. Above you argued that all fields are influenced the same way by cultural pressures. Now you argue that they can't be compared at all. Your arguments are completely contradictory. In any case, there is absolutely no reason we can't compare the evolution of type design to the evolution of architecture, poetry, airplane design or any other field. How useful that will be will depend on the question we are discussing.
I was addressing the issue of innovation, and if you look at type of say, 1540--Claude Garamond--it is not only perfectly readable today, but greatly admired, continually revived, and widely used as a text font.
If you look at science of 1540, Copernicus was about to be published. People believed the earth was at the center of the universe, and the sun and stars revolved around it. Yet to come, nearly a century later, was Galileo, with his telescope and new physics. And William Harvey and the discovery of circulation of the blood. Yet to come was Newton and astoundingly accurate theory of motion in the heavens and earth--and a concomitant weakening of religious belief. Yet to come too was the theory and use of electricity, the atomic theory of chemistry, relativity, quantuum theory, and the discovery of the structure of DNA.
If you wanted to use the science of 1540 today you would be regarded as insane--or criminal if you are an engineer. If you want to use the type of Claude Garamond--well, conventional but perfectly acceptable.
I know how very able a type designer and knowledgeable a type historian you are, but your implication that Gill is on the same level as an innovator as Newton or Crick & Watson is simply ludicrous.

My feeling is that the word origins in roots are so distant from most people’s consciousness that that wouldn’t have been an obstacle, but I may be wrong.</em>
I think opposition to spelling reform comes from a number of different directions. Some opposition is what I would call conservationist, i.e. from people who understand and appreciate the positive aspects of an etymological spelling system; such opposition tends to be focused among academics and writers. A broader opposition derives from what I could classify as practical concerns about both the process and results of spelling reform. Depending on the nature and extent of a spelling reform, it makes the majority of the population temporarily illiterate or, at least, of reduced literacy. This is why exercises in spelling reform, as in script change, have been most successful in situations where the majority of the population is already illiterate (80% in Ataturk's Turkey when the Latin script orthography was introduced in the 1920s). Once people can read, they are not inclined to have to learn to read again. This is a kind of conservatism, I suppose, but it is one founded on practical concerns about lost time, impact on the economy, etc. and not in a conservative attitude or disposition. There are also practical concerns about <em>which</em> approach to take to spelling reform, and hence what the results will look like. Once you open the door to spelling reform, people are unlikely to agree on which reform should be adopted. [If Hrant were here, I'm sure he would point out that spelling reform would be much easier if one had a king/dictator to lay down the law, and he is certainly right.] Finally, we have the example of attempted spelling reforms from other languages -- the monotonous Greek example, the traditional/reformed Malayalam debate, and the less far-reaching German reform of 1996 -- and what we see is that the old spellings never actually go away, and one ends up with two (or more) different orthographies for the same language, with some people using one and some the other.</div>

No, I said that the shape of the alphabet is not, as you had clearly stated, a field. Therefore it cannot be compared to science. You talk about the shape of the alphabet not changing as being a fundament, well so is the fact that chemists still mix liquids in glass vessels and heat them!
<em>If you wanted to use the science of 1540 today you would be regarded as insane—or criminal if you are an engineer. If you want to use the type of Claude Garamond—well, conventional but perfectly acceptable.</em>
Firstly, the heart of science--mathemetics--was in place in 1540. They used the same number system as we do. In observation and classification, would you not say that a medieval herbal book would be regarded as more sane than, say, string theory, with its DC Comic multiverses? Also, their cathedrals seem to have been generally constructed on sound principles. Of course, the theoretical aspect of 16th century science is not very convincing today, but the same could be said of 16th century typographic theory. As with science, a core has remained (e.g. the format of the "codex"); we stand on the shoulders of giants, but much else has changed.
Secondly, Garamond's type, although it would be legible, would not be acceptable--even for that tiny amount of typesetting done in letterpress shops. Consider that the verbatim transcriptions of Renaissance type (e.g. Poliphilus) are of little use.
Thirdly, I have to point out again the irrelevance of your comparison, because you are not comparing discipline with discipline. A revolution in a discipline is a revolution in a discipline. Crick, Watson et al revolutionized genetic theory as it was understood at the time. Gill, Renner, and Koch revolutionized typography as it was practised at the time.
<em>my years of study in the history of science, including a PhD in the field. </em>
<em>I know how very able a type designer</em>
Bill, I'm not pulling rank on you with the "appeal to authority" argument. This kind of thing is irrelevant and unworthy in a forum on a multi-disciplinary subject where participants come from all kinds of backgrounds. What one says should stand on its own feet.
<em>your implication that Gill is on the same level as an innovator as Newton or Crick & Watson is simply ludicrous.</em>
Rubbish. Gill had comparable, if not more effect on typography than Crick, Watson et al had on science.
As an innovator, political activist, style icon and all-round eccentric celebrity, Gill would best be compared with Einstein.

<div class=commentbody>One reason not to adopt a phonetic alphabet is that it would make the letter r obsolete (and if that doesn't tell you where I'm from, nothing will).
The qwerty layout was designed to maximize hands alternation, not slow you down. That myth is actually struck down on wikipedia, for god's sake!
Letter forms have changed quite a bit over time. I can say this with some certainty because I researched the history of each letter for my font, and found out how long blackletter was the primary type in many areas (you'd also be surprised to learn that some areas of New York spoke Dutch exclusively well into the 80's)</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>The calculus, which was the basis for the new physics of Newton, was not invented until long after this period. So the mathematics was not in place.</em>
Choosing the invention of calculus as a dividing line for "real" science is somewhat arbitrary. The numbers we use today, including zero, pre-date the Renaissance. In fact as a set they have proved more durable than the letters of the alphabet; understandably, as they are discoveries, not inventions. Also addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, none of which were obselesced by calculus, as well as many geometric concepts such as dividing the circle into degrees, and Archimedes' knowledge of pi, i.e. how to calculate the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere, which is still of practical use today. Wasn't Archimedes a scientist?
<em>rather than assuming you know better.</em>
I don't believe I ever made that assumption. I questioned your use of analogy, and didn't try to help my case by casting doubt on your knowledge of art and typography by citing my qualifications and experience.
Ultimately, I think that the use of analogy between science and typography falls short because the one deals with discoveries, the other with inventions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick: <em>Choosing the invention of calculus as a dividing line for “real” science is somewhat arbitrary.</em>
I don't think that's what Bill said. His point was surely that the mathematics was also developing -- and continues to develop -- past the foundational work of the Greeks, Arabs and mediaeval contributions, and specifically that branch of mathematics that made Newtonian physics possible was not in place in 1540. Yes, of course a lot of mathematics was in place in 1540, but what you can do with that mathematics in terms of science is severely limited compared to what you can do with later mathematics.
But the point should also be made that mathematics is not 'the heart of science', it is a tool of science. The heart of science is observation and experiment. In 1540, as Bill points out, a lot of the observation and experiment that contribute to modern science simply had not taken place yet, ergo the science of 1540 is not as useful to us today as, comparatively, the type designs of 1540 remain. This shouldn't surprise us, and I don't see where the room for debate is: 'science' is a huge field encompassing many avenues of research and enquiry, whose scope is limited only by the size of the observable universe, typography is a small field constrained by the need to be readable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just to put the issues here into larger context, I do think there have been innovations in the arts as profound, though less socially consequential, as the innovations in science. For example the invention of polyphony in music and of perspective drawing in art were really revolutionary.
But in type my argument has been that the relative fixity of the alphabet limits the speed and scope of innovation in type design. That's why type design is an inherently more conservative medium.
Nick, in referring to your expertise in type, I wasn't conceding that I know nothing about type. I have learned a bit about it over the past few years. Enough to understand how small of an innovator Gill was. I also understand more about the nature of innovation in the development of science, and that it is on a scale way beyond that which occurs in type.
In the field of typography, I would say that the asymmetric typography of the early twentieth century--which used older types--was far more innovative than Gill's work, given the context of the work of Johnston and of stone carved letters that Gill drew upon. Of course, the asymmetry was influenced by Oriental art, but it was still a more innovative look to my eyes than anything of Gill's. And early twentieth century painting has much more innovative work in it than either--reflecting the conservative constraints on type design.
By contrast, Einstein's work was a much more radical break with the past than either Gill or the New Typography. It is so much more innovative--new concepts of time and space, the strange world of quantuum theory--that it is, as I said earlier, ridiculous to speak of Gill and Einstein's innovations in the same breath.
Try asking anybody who is familiar with them both, and see what they say.

<div class=commentbody><em>the relative fixity of the alphabet limits the speed and scope of innovation in type design. That’s why type design is an inherently more conservative medium.</em>
Certainly alphabets are slow to change, but what bearing does this have on how radical the changes in type design are?
Type design followed a chirographic model for its first 350 years, with contrasted stroke weights and serifs.
Then c.1800, proliferation, driven by commercial changes, occurred, extablishing a new, multi-genre paradigm with many non-chirographic forms, such as slab serif, sans serif, and 3D.
The alphabet didn't change much (although the long s was thrown out), but the changes to the discipline of typography were surely as radical as those occasioned to the discipline of science by relativity theory.
In type history, historians such as T.B. Reed and D.B. Updike completely omitted the 19th century innovations, an indication of how profoundly radical they were to the establishment!
Of course, revolutions in science have more effect on the world at large than revolutions in typography.
<em>By contrast, Einstein’s work was a much more radical break with the past than either Gill or the New Typography.</em>
Well, as I've said all along, these aren't the kind of things that bear close analogizing, but if you must, compare before and after of the paradigm shift that the sans serifs of Gill, Renner etc were part of c.1930.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Life_5504.jpg]
Before: Illustration, symmetry, historicist serif typography
After: Photography, asymmetry, modernist sans serif typography--and bleed
Those are the general characteristics of the changes that occurred to graphic design and typography around 1930
IMO, that was every bit a "radical break with the past" as anything in science.
<em>ridiculous to speak of Gill and Einstein’s innovations in the same breath.</em>
If you really believe that, in future please do refrain from any more science-art-typography analogies!

Yeah, that's why they gave him the Nobel prize for inventing it.

<div class=commentbody>Bill, why Newton and Einstein?
Why not Saussure and Chomsky?
Surely there are other scientific perspectives on reading other than behaviorism?
And from those perspectives, the idea that there is such a thing as a "best-performing sans serif" would seem antiquated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bill, Nick: interesting debate. IMHO both views are legitimate. And true, in the sense that they're parallel. Conservativism in typography vs. revolutions in science is a valid observation. And Nick's claim that it means comparing apples to albatrosses actually answers that observation.
What is missing in the discussion a little, is ergonomy. Technologies, mostly results of scientific research, are here for homo sapiens sapiens. They are tools that are refined until they reach what I call "ergonomic optimum". I think good examples could be knife or trousers. Once the tool reaches its ergonomic optimum and is almost perfectly fitted for use by humans, progress of its improvement rapidly slows down (as there is little to improve in the given moment) and its production continues with focus on variations. You have blue jeans and black jeans, cotton jeans and rubber trousers, but in reality do they differ so much, in substance, from what men were wearing in 19th century? The development of trousers is now much more in terms of fashion/style than in terms of suitability for use.
When Goudy was speaking about old bastards stealing all the best ideas, he had said in other words that latin type including its character shapes basically reached its ergonomic optimum and we are limited to variations.
So until science comes with something revolutionary that would create an opportunity for the technology to provide some tools with <em>radical</em> ergonomic advantage in terms of language, alphabet & reading, typography must be "conservative" and limited to progress in quite small steps. Just my 2 cents.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>samey</cite>
I had to laugh out loud when I first got to this thread because while I do now see what you had meant my first reaction to think over all the really lovely work that has come out in the last 10-15 years. It's true that much of it is a slice at the "same pie" but that also means a diversity/richness and even a potential for expressive precision which is quite astonishingly wonderful. Looked at that way it's not "samey" at all.
I think that we are too concerned in mainstream design with the next big thing because much design is fashion rather than utility driven much of the time. Good or bad it is so. But to come to type and that apply that same kind of cultural bias or assumption or fascination with that which is novel or radical is maybe a bit silly. Yes there are fashions in type ( is the round-type trend over yet?) but in general and especially where text is concerned that is just so much foam over the deeps of utility.
But even in purely fashion terms details that escape all but the most expert eye are the "magic" that let's type speak in a given voice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben, your cultural bias is showing when you tag typography with the fashion epithet, when you could just as easily do that to science. Just look at a magazine like New Scientist and the stuff they cover every week. Last year it was quantum-this and quantum that, now it's green-this and green-that. Don't tell me research funding for mainstream science doesn't follow the same patterns.

<div class=commentbody>To equate "New Scientist" with Science per se is not really solid thinking. It's a "popular" magazine not "Primary Literature" for goodness sake.
But really that is besides the point. Because I am not advocating science as some kind of solution in this case! I don't need to because it isn't essential to my point. Instead I am only talking about the needs of the eye and judgement of an experienced eye such as your own.

<div class=commentbody><em>To equate “New Scientist” with Science per se is not really solid thinking.</em>
It represents Science as a whole. I suppose I could have chosen Scientific American.
My point: follow the money is follow the trends. I said, "Don’t tell me research funding for mainstream science doesn’t follow the same patterns."
Recently, for instance, in Europe, the UK government cut funding for things such as its support of the CERN particle accelerator (I read it in NS). My interpretation, because theoretical physics is so last year.
I mean, if you are going to discuss that aspect of design which is trend driven, that's OK, but if I mention that aspect of Science which concerns trends, suddenly, that's not primary literature? Play fair!
<em>I think that we are too concerned in mainstream design with the next big thing because much design is fashion rather than utility driven much of the time. </em>
Can we move beyond this simplistic duality of art vs science, fashion vs utility?
loremipsum mentions ergonomics.
Don Norman recognizes the multi-dimensional aspect of such design, that it should be elegant, functional, and understandable. And with emotional appeal.
There are two kinds of usability that are designed into a typeface.
One is for the typographer, one is for the reader.
That's an interesting idea. Time for a new thread!

<div class=commentbody>What a stimulating thread. Typography and science (well, at least technology) need each other in several ways, but of course they are vastly different disciplines in scope, history and importance. Modern printing depends on computers to calculate and display every outline of every glyph we see on our monitor screens or read in most books other than those printed in letterpress. I am not up to date on what is going on in perceptual studies of reading or the evaluation of legibility, but I know that it is posible to track where the eyes are focused when we read, and statistical methods could be employed to decide what makes a good type for reading.
The great calligraphers and type designers of yore found solutions to these problems instinctively: that letters have to be as different from each other as possible, and yet have a unifying visual logic to them. That serifs in Latin script create a line the eyes can track easily while reading small text. But nowadays surely scientific methods can be used to determine why this is so, and whether new sorts of designs can improve our comfort and enjoyment of the act of reading. I also think that typography and science attract people with very similar mind-sets where patience, a good sense of observation, the ability to think logically, organize extensive sets of data and manipulate them systematically are valued in both fields.
And science needs typography, as anyone who has tried to write a scientific paper can attest. The mysteries of LaText and the various programs for writing equations, and the design of symbols for mathematics and chemistry come to mind here.
Coming to think of it a couple of years ago I created a Beautiful Universe font where the glyphs consisted of graphic representation of spinning nodes to create the illustrations of a [[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/tamari/vladimir/bu1.html|physics paper]] I was writing. Each glyph showed the nodes in different orientations, while its weight indicated its relative rate of spin. It was easy typing row after row of these nodes to represent a field of propagating energy, or of nodes clustering into matter. See [[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/tamari/vladimir/bu1.html]][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Field-curvature_6098.gif]</div>

You haven't shopped for pants lately, have you.
Earlier today, even, I was told a story by a teacher about a recent shopping expirience, in which he shopped for jeans for the first time in some years (I don't know how many). He walked up to the person (evidently, he was at a "nice" place) and asked to buy some jeans. The reply: "Would you like boot fit, wide cut, slim fit,...", prompting him to ask "what ever happened to just jeans?"
While this is a rough retelling from memory, it's quite illustrative on how far we are from samey.
Hell, I saw some pants at REI which had the inseam going across the crotch (probably to reduce chafing when hiking).</div>

<cite> Can we move beyond this simplistic duality of art vs science, fashion vs utility? loremipsum mentions ergonomics. </cite>
Maybe. But to do so somebody would have to come up with an idea that seems to better describe what's going on. I am not saying it can't be done - gobs of old ideas have been turned over & replaced. This one is not special. But until then...
You have decried against this kind of thing in the past & no doubt you have your reasons, but so far I have failed to understand them as being anything other than a general rejection of modernist reductionism with it's attendant ( and often false ) celebration of sheer utility. At least this is my understanding. Maybe instead of railing against the idea of utility/craft which has not moved me much so far it would be better to describe the virtues of what you advocate.
And as to there being fashions among people who practice science - of course there are. They are people. People who do science don't per se = science. This kind of superficial and ultimately false equation keeps coming up in arguments. It should be put to rest. Or better still the distinction aught to be admitted.
I don't argue that bees are sweet because they make honey. Or that honey flies because bees do. But obviously the two are rightly & tightly associated. Should they not be? Of course not. But they are different in important ways. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>[to move beyond simplistic duality] somebody would have to come up with an idea that seems to better describe what’s going on.</em>
I've suggested a couple of paradigms as alternatives to the "laboratory testing vs experienced eye" dichotomy.
Firstly, there is ergonomics and usability, as it may be understood in the work of Don Norman.
I like the idea that fonts are tools, and that their design functionality is as much for the typographer as for the reader, and that their success may be determined as much by their sales performance in the metaculture (trade environment) as by their acceptance with readers. After all, graphic designers choose typefaces, whereas readers choose end products in which type is only a component.
Secondly there is semiotics, which has been applied to typography, in a critical, post-structural manner.
<em>Maybe instead of railing against the idea of utility/craft which has not moved me much so far it would be better to describe the virtues of what you advocate.</em>
I haven't been railing against the idea of utility. In this thread I have mainly disputed the usefulness of the statement that the alphabet evolves slowly compared with science, and questioned its corollary that typography is conservative whereas science is radical.
I advocate a wariness of applying the rudimentary scientific knowledge we have of reading to the practice of typography, the virtues being that this will be better for graphic designers, typographers, type designers and independent foundries, and better for readers and typography in general.
<em>And as to there being fashions among people who practice science - of course there are. They are people. People who do science don’t per se = science. This kind of superficial and ultimately false equation keeps coming up in arguments.</em>
You are the one who is formulating such equations, e.g. "much design is fashion rather than utility driven much of the time," i.e. design = much fashion.
I did not say there are fashions among scientists, I said there are fashions in science, which may be observed in New Scientist, and I suggested that these fashions are politically and economically driven, with the example of the UK's funding for the CERN accelerator. I wouldn't say that attempting to deconstruct the trends in science is superficial. Don't you agree that money makes the world go round?
But you're right, I should "describe virtues" in a more positive manner, and start some semiotic/postmodern threads.

<div class=commentbody>Shouldn't the discussion be on using scientific methods to evaluate type, rather than trying to compare typographical oranges with scientific apples? Issues such as legibility, eye-strain, reading comprehension, even the degree to which we like certain typefaces or glyphs can all be evaluated systematically in controlled laboratory conditions. I wonder if this sort of thing is being done and whether the typographical community is benefitting from such studies.
Eben, thanks - can you be more specific about which concepts have been discredited and where one can study such matters?
By the way scientists as a group are quite conservative: new theories are resisted as a matter of course. Progress seems so rapid only because so much concerted effort is being spent all over the world in countless universities, industrial and govenmental labs. In science too things tend to be a bit samey on a day-to-day level! As in typography this conservatism has a certain benefit as an antidote to chaotic innovation for its own sake.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> I advocate a wariness of applying the rudimentary scientific knowledge we have of reading to the practice of typography </cite>
In some sense I don't disagree with this statement. I agree in the sense that it is always good to keep the provisional nature of our explanations for things in mind - and not just the scientific ones. Where I think we diverge is that I think science has potential to be a tool to advance type, whereas you would prefer to leave it alone and to be left alone. This is partly because you are perhaps skeptical about science itself*, quite skeptical about the scientific establishment; about which I am somewhat sympathetic, and definitely skeptical about it's utility where type design is concerned. This last part we don't agree about. And certainly what you say there about what we have as being rudimentary is something that I am in complete agreement with you about.
* I don't know quite where you stand here. You have made statements in both directions I think.
<cite> You are the one who is formulating such equations </cite>
I did formulate. Agreed. But it was to describe what I thought you had built into your statements as an implicit formula rather than an explicit one. You do it again here: <cite> I said there are fashions in science </cite> My point is that science per se is an approach. The practice of science in reality involves people. You have your ends mixed up or better put - reversed. On the other When you say <cite> I wouldn’t say that attempting to deconstruct the trends in science is superficial. </cite> I can cannot disagree at all. There is plenty we agree about & even more that I want to understand. But our ontological difference regarding what it means when you say science remains and is a stumbling block. Maybe the next time we meet I can bring you a scientific American and the Primary Lit that is referred to & we can talk about how they are different. But only if you really want to know.
Even if the stumbling block remains (as I suspect it will) the key thing I would like to hear you elucidate further has nothing to do with science. I think we aught to drop that aspect because that's a brush you tagged my previous statements with falsely as far I am concerned. This formula of "art vs science = fashion vs utility" is something I don't buy.
Instead what I want to know about more is how you would replace "fashion vs utility". And again I don't mean utility in a modernist sense, and not in a scientific sense but merely as a typographer would be concerned with it. Put another way I mean utility as you might think of it rather than as might imagine I do. The other thing is that the old debate has less to do with fashion with it's relation to temporary acceptance/ardour and more to do with style. In some ways of course style can undergird utility or partner with it in a design or not. Maybe this is what you mean to get at. This partnership. In any event: since you have a different way of splitting things or a different descriptions of the relationship involved I want to know more about it.
<cite> Eben, thanks - can you be more specific about which concepts have been discredited and where one can study such matters?</cite> You can look at threads on typophile that are about "readability" to start. I would use google advanced "site search". I will try to reply in more detail later on. In the meantime I can say that your statements bring up enough stuff to generate 6 or seven independent threads. So it's a bit hard to know where to start. That's not a dig at you BTW, just my sense of what's there. An example would be <cite> That serifs in Latin script create a line the eyes can track easily while reading small text. </cite> I don't think this is widely accepted anymore and I think there is no science lit that credibly demonstrates that this is so. Moreover if you read Kevin Larson's or Peter Enneson's work/statements you will find theories that as far as I can tell don't rely on serifs or describe their role in that way. This doesn't mean you are wrong, ( I admit to being skeptical ) just that it isn't considered a settled or accepted idea.</div>

Only in so far as I don't believe it can explain everything; but the provisionality of its truths are inherent of course, because scientific belief is not like religious belief. The scientist believes that truth is "state of the art", whereas the religionist believes it's absolute.
<em> I can bring you a scientific American and the Primary Lit that is referred to & we can talk about how they are different.</em>
When I mentioned it, I was thinking of <em>Scientific American</em> as a more hardcore science magazine than New Scientist, but it wasn't the right example, I should have chosen a peer-review journal such as <em>Nature.</em>
<em>what I want to know about more is how you would replace “fashion vs utility”</em>
As I said, by discussing readability in terms of either semiotics, or usability amongst typographers rather than readers. The latter is more appealing.

<div class=commentbody>How would a semiotic view be put? I can't begin to imagine. What distinctions or relationships do you imagine?
And coming back to my original quip: What about the idea that a historical view of type is easier but more superficial when Style & period are primary concerns and that maybe relative utility would be a as good or maybe even a better axis to consider. It isn't that I don't appreciate what makes a good coffee table book : that is shifting style. But in terms of what's interesting to me it's utility & how style can serve or get in the way of it.
So I suppose in my mind it isn't a question of "vs" because the two can coexist quite nicely. It's when they are at odds that I have to pick sides.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick: <em>The scientist believes that truth is “state of the art”, whereas the religionist believes it’s absolute.</em>
That misrepresents both science and religion. What is 'state of the art' for science is what we <em>know</em> about what is true, not truth itself. Scientists tend of have exactly the same correspondence theory of truth as most theologians, i.e. what is true is understood to correspond to what is real, so both have ultimately an absolute notion of truth. And both scientists and theologians acknowledge limits to what we know about that ultimate truth. Theologians tend to acknowledge limits to what we can know, as well as limits to what we do know (at least in this life), whereas limits to scientific knowledge are often assumed to be practical and temporary.</div>

I don't know. I haven't figured out how one would apply semiotics to readability theory.
Perhaps Enneson has given it some thought.
<em>In what possible way does it inform your choices as a designer?</em>
It doesn't, with respect to readability factors, because IMO there's no way that theory can help there, you just have to work out by practice out how to style it smoothly--hand, eye, and the right side of the brain. So here, I'm a romantic.
However, with respect to usability factors, I'd say that Bodoni Egyptian (the name says it all) is something that type professionals can understand, and understand as a cultural concept. So here, I'm wearing a postmodern hat. It's nothing new--the Miller & Richards modernized old-style of c.1850 was, in its time, a post-modern typeface. And going way back, I'd have to say that when Jenson, Griffo et al decided that humanist lower-case broadpen writing could be given, in metal, the serif treatment of Ancient Roman upper case stone carvings, that too was postmodernism.</div>

Nicely put. Although I have met plenty of religionists who believe in absolute religious truth.
John, where do you fall these days where it comes to the relationship of style vs utility? Do you have any truck with a "semiotic view" of Type?
This question reminds me of that over-long thread where I made the claim that type in and of itself, is culturally or as an agent of meaning, too small to support the complexities of the postmodern.

<div class=commentbody><em> whereas limits to scientific knowledge are often assumed to be practical and temporary </em>. John, this may apply to certain problems in technology, but the concensus now is to wait and see what new theories and discoveries will bring. The attitude you refer to may have died with Lord Kelvin's infamous boast about physics having reached a state of perfection - just a few years before the great revolutions of the 20th c. - oops! I googled 'Lord Kelvin' and 'end of physics' and now Paul Davis' new book <em>The New Physics</em> is said to claim the same sort of thing. But need one go into such deep waters merely to apply some practical logic to various questions relating to typography?
<em> In the meantime I can say that your statements bring up enough stuff to generate 6 or seven independent threads.

Its as hard to read the small print on the gray background as to wade through the many interesting remarks resonating on this page alone.
<em> I was thinking of </em>Scientific American<em> as a more hardcore science magazine than </em>New Scientist<em> but it wasn’t the right example, I should have chosen a peer-review journal such as </em> Nature.Nick,I am a regular reader of both <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>nature</em> (their title is always in lowercase which is a nice touch)but find the former much easier: it tries hard to keep up to date and does not avoid key ideas in various fields. Their website [[www.sciam.com]] is highly recommended, although it has practically nothing to say about type design. Perhaps journals of vision research or perceptual psychology deal more with our concerns.
And finally this thought: Gutenberg, the patron saint of typographers, invented movable type and helped launch a cultural revolution that favored scientific progress. Isn't it time that science returns the favor and gives type designers a few tips?

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps it's good to point out that typography is actually communication. Human communication has many levels: body language, tone of voice, pitch of voice, quality of speech, selection of words, meaning of the message etc. Typography communicates on many levels too. The choice of typeface and layout not only facilitates (or not) the process of receiving the information, but also communicates specific aesthetics and has many different connotations.
When science makes a revolutionary discovery, e. g. ten new planets, it does not necessarily mean that it has impact on human communication. And when scientific revolutions do not have any ergonomic implications for typographic communication, is this "conservativism of typography"? No, it's not.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben: <em>John, where do you fall these days where it comes to the relationship of style vs utility?</em>
As I must have written elsewhere on Typophile at some point over the past few years, perhaps more than once, I think there is an extra-utile aspect to pretty much everything that human beings make (and a lot of things that other species make too), and this is an expression of our aesthetic impulse, our love of form which complements our desire for function.
Yesterday afternoon I visited a local <a href=http://www.varnahandcycles.com/>human-powered vehicle designer and builder</a> who makes bikes and other vehicles for handicapped people and also enclosed bicycles that hold the current world records in human-powered speed trials. The latter, like the airplanes discussed earlier in this thread, are designed for maximum air efficiency (so much so that when one rider wiped out at 70+ km/h the whole bike became airborne horizontally), but they are also very beautiful shapes and, interestingly, the guy who makes them is a sculptor by training, not an engineer. As with the airplanes discussed, the requirements for maximum efficiency and minimal friction limit the variety of shapes that can be used in such vehicles -- although there remain variations as different teams try to improve on previous models --, and I don't think even the most functionalist driven approach to type design is going to be so constrained, except in particular circumstances (which might perhaps be likened to the the particular circumstances of flying or travelling at 85 km/h using only one-half horsepower).
As I've also written elsewhere, I consider legibility a prerequisite for a typeface, as is a baseline of readability. There are specific technical circumstances, of which low resolution devices are an obvious example, in which meeting these prerequisites of legibility and readability puts constraints on extra-utile aspects of type design; indeed, in such circumstances the utile may be expected to overtake all other considerations and seeking every improvement in legibility and readability will become the principle goal of the design <em>because no other goal is reasonably attainable.</em> But there are other, extra-utile and complementary goals that are proper to type design, and many circumstances in which these play a greater role, and even circumstances in which they might legitimately challenge standards of legibility and readability for aesthetic effect (as in the diwani style of Arabic calligraphy).
I have written at length elsewhere about what I term 'readerability', which is not something that I think should be taken for granted or abused, but which should keep us sane when we look at what constitutes readability and measures of readability. Human beings are good at reading, and they read in a remarkable diversity of writing systems, styles, material qualities of print and other 'output', and circumstances. We need to respect that ability, and that means both designing to accomodate the ways in which people have already learned to read and also recognising the adaptability of that learning.
So I am all in favour of type designers exploring new stylistic directions, whether driven by utile or extra-utile concerns, and whether informed by insights of science or by memories of some handlettering they once saw on the side of a bus in Nepal. I also reserve the right to love the results or hate them, and that may not depend on how easily I can read them.
<em>Do you have any truck with a “semiotic view” of Type?</em>
I'm not even sure I what that means. I think Nick's attempt to define glyphs as signifiers and alphabetic letters as signified is a misapplication of structuralist sign theory, and agree that it veers toward Platonism. I prefer my semiotics Aristotelian and nominalist, so I'd say that there is no meaningful distinction to be made between the glyph A and the letter A. The letter A is the set of A's that exist in the world, even those we only think of. The sign relationship is not of glyph to letter but of glyph-letter to various phonetic phenomena and semantic constructs.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Since when have advances in science and technology benefited the artisans who use the obscelesced technology?</em> True,TV killed the radio star- but I wouldn't call the computers, software, and printers we are now using obscelesced (well maybe I have to get a new keyboard). I first conceived the Arabic font I am now working on for metal type back in the early 1960's. At that time I visited Monotype Corp. and held Eric Gill's original ink drawings for his Sans - for me it was a bit like holding a beautiful illuminated manuscript. Then a war occured and I left the project unfinished and missed all the photo-typsetting developments. Now I am enjoying the fruits of so many engineers' and scientist's work to use the computer to convert my designs to a digital font. My point is that yes technologies change and affect people in various ways, good or bad, but why not make the best of the tools available at any one time?
Thanks John for an inspiring take on the craft of type design, comparing it to the work of the bicycle designer you visited.

For searching the terms legibility, readability etc Try putting this in a bookmark. It should let you search Typophile via google.
javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))
This is what it puts into the URL line with the search term "Readability"
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20Readability
If a page has moved from Typophile then you can sometimes get it out of the google cache.

<div class=commentbody>Vladimir: <em>John I am not sure I understand what the difference is between legibility and readability.</em>
I'm not sure anyone does, although some people are adamant that there is a (significant) difference. I think there is a conventional distinction, made in these discussions, so I usually make reference to both legibility and readability to avoid possible confusion by only referring to one. The distinction, as usually expressed, is that legibility refers to the recognisability of individual letterforms, while readability refers to something less well defined but involving how easy the typeface is to read (usually measured in terms of speed and comprehension, or reckoned in reference to more subjective measures such as pleasure and comfort).
I think there are a number of problems with this distinction, although that doesn't mean that it isn't sometimes useful in discussion. The first problem is that the distinction, if significant, implies that legibility is insufficient to readability or that readability is somehow independent of legibility. If we're serious about wanting to understand how reading works, then I think this distinction is begging the question. It is a conventional distinction that assumes a real, significant distinction. One alternative way to look at the relationship would be to say that legibility is the core of readability. Another way would be to say that everything called readability, according to the above definition, is actually an aspect of legibility, and the term readability properly refers to higher level features, e.g. document layout and structure, prose style, etc. The latter is how the cognitive psychologist Mary Dyson presented the distinction to me.
I'm not saying that we should favour a particular alternative use for these terms, only that we should be aware that our use is conventional and that there are alternatives, and that it would be presumptive to assume that the distinction, as we commonly make is here, corresponds to reality. I'm not even sure that the distinction is useful, since it seems to lead so many discussions in circles.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have been thinking about Legibility in terms of individual forms or how easily you recognize an "a" as an "a". I have been thinking about Readability in terms of the relationships set up by combining letters and how that impacts reading.
This a private definition however. And I agree that the terms are soft and prone to generating conversational quicksand.
You will find in the other threads that Peter Enneson makes a strong case that neither term is really precise enough. So strong in fact that John H used part of it as a quote at the end of his email. Here it is.

"Yes" to the part before "or" and "no" to that after. I don't think anyone contests that illegible letters will make for unreadable text.
>If we’re serious about wanting to understand how reading works, then I think this distinction is begging the question.
The way I use the distinction is not to beg the question but to assert the question. Operationally, our ability to distinguish single letters and our speed and comprehension of reading text can be tested for separately. And perhaps comfort can also be tested for. The operational distinction means that the question of how one relates to the other is meaningful and sensible.
The discussions in circles in my view have been a result of the lack of any good research data to decide the issue of whether there is more to readability than legibility. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Bill: <em>The way I use the distinction is not to beg the question but to assert the question. Operationally, our ability to distinguish single letters and our speed and comprehension of reading text can be tested for separately.</em>
Our ability to recognise/distinguish single letters can certainly be tested independently of reading speed, comprehension, comfort, etc.; but I don't think we can assert the reverse. I don't think anyone has demonstrated that we can test reading independently of letter recognition, and that is the whole crux of the debate about how we read. Of course, there are parlour games that one can play with partially obscured letters in text, in which we're able to 'read', i.e. make out, the text from partial letter information and context -- during which we're still presumably guessing at letter identity -- but such things don't tell us anything about how we actually read normal text.
With that caveat, I agree with your assertion that the (possibly one-directional) operational distinction -- the fact that recognition of individual letters <em>can</em> be tested independently of reading -- does imply a meaningful question about how such recognition relates to reading; it doesn't imply an answer to that question though, and I don't think other people -- including me at various times-- have been as careful as you in avoiding begging the question. </div>

I think this formulation is not quite on the mark. One can test legibility by flashing letters very briefly and see under what conditions people confuse letters of a typeface. One can also test the level of speed and comprehension of a passage of text in different typefaces. The tests are independent, in that a *possible* result is that two typefaces are equally equally legible according to the first test, but one face does much better on reading tests. Getting an *actual* experimental result like this is what has not been done--and admittedly may never be. I am guessing that within five years such difference will be found.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks eliason, Eben and JohnH - I was hoping for a simple answer- one that I can use as a rule-of thumb in font design. Wading through the discussions and references convinced me that until vision and brain research can deal intelligently with the many variables that seem to affect legibility and readablity (however one defines them) typography remains pretty much an art form. William- yes perhaps in five years' time- there are many advances in cognition research, for example using MRI scans while the subject is performing a given task. Perhaps bright red spots will appear in some type-perception region of the brain, whenever a badly-designed glyph or font is read?! :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Rule of thumb sorts of stuff seems to be limited to the o needing to overshoot the x height & similar optically/perception based observations. But really all of it is pretty deeply contextual eg. you move/change one thing and it ends up impacting the whole. As you have probably seen I have argued that science may help type design eventually. But knitting the two disciplines together in a meaningful way will not be easy.
<cite> a *possible* result </cite>
All you would have to have to make an meaningful impact on readability is differences in the quality of the kerning between two identical faces. It stands to reason that two different faces letters will interact differently. And the relationship of letters is every bit as important as the shapes themselves. It would be nice if William was right about five years but I am not guessing that's right.

Science can help basket ball too, but all the basket ball research in the world isn't going get you into the NBA.

<div class=commentbody>Maybe you mean playing for the NBA. It might get you employed at Nike though... But whatever - It's a suspect analogy anyway. Or at least I think so.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In the Olympics, science has given top athletes who use the better equipment or better training techniques an edge, so they've won. Then the next time around everyone has the advances. [Of course there are also illegal performance-enhancing drugs, but that's another issue.]
Science might give some insights to help the best type designers and typographers be even better. Also it might certify that some typographic practices are bad that we know anyway are bad; scientific authority would help reduce them. </div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> I am not sure I understand what the difference is between legibility and readability. </cite>
<cite> I’m not sure anyone does, although some people are adamant that there is a (significant) difference. I think there is a conventional distinction, made in these discussions, so I usually make reference to both legibility and readability to avoid possible confusion by only referring to one. The distinction, as usually expressed, is that legibility refers to the recognisability of individual letterforms, while readability refers to something less well defined but involving how easy the typeface is to read. </cite>
It seems to me this distinction comes from the fact that we have both intrinsic and habit-derived elements determining how a writing form is more pleasing et functional.
Perhaps the intrinsic aspect may be evaluated with scientific means of quantification or calculation, but it seems to me all other factors are constantly changed and an inherent value which makes no sense to quantify exists…
A thing which occurred to me the first time I read about this distinction in English here on Typophile is that we do not have two words to express this thing in Italian: we just have "leggibilità" which is an overall term. This is strange, since Italian is an extremely detailed language (even too much) in terms of vocabulary, but it may just be that no studies have been done, since typography went downhill more or less after Bodoni's time…
But at the same time I remembered that in Italian we have two terms for "scientist". The one associated with the English one is "scienziato", and the other is "scientista", where the meaning of the term "science" is differently intended, since science in modern times have become synonimous with analytic and quantification thought applied to the form(s) of natural phenomena.
Typography looks to me a very strange science (in the full-scale meaning of the word), since it can be performed professionally merely by a growing process of intuition, vision and hard work, although study may benefit from it. Of course, graphic design culture of the XX century reduced the average man's perception of it to the one of a disposable aesthetic tool.</div>
