  of this wooden type came:\r\nhttp://ferfolio.com/files/storage/_MG_9785.JPG\r\nAny
  idea what it is?\r\n\r\nAnd, here I have to typefaces for you guys to try and identify:\r\nhttp://ferfolio.com/files/storage/_MG_9782.JPG\r\n(the
  complete serif-ish middle one, and the lower right one, with contrast)\r\n\r\nAny

    didn't recognize it off hand. Anyone else have an idea?\r\nDon"

  body: "Well Fernando, all I can say at this stage is that you have a real collector's
    item. Unfortunately somebody \"broke the sort\" on this font and got rid of the
    letters piecemeal. The design is attractive and would make a good digital font,
    but it would be a great help if there were some more letters. \r\nSame applies
    to the thick capitals in the middle row, which have some similarity to Binner
    http://www.myfonts.com/search/binner/fonts/\r\nI take it you purchased the letters
    in South America. So they could be designs originating in the US, England or continental
    Europe, or even in South America for that matter.\r\nIf you find any more letters
    that seem to match either font It would be wonderful if you could share them with
    us.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Fernando, good news! I found the g with the open lower bottom bowl --
    and the rest of the font too. It's a woodtype from Tubbs & Co. cira 1900, that
    Dan X. Solo purchased in one of his type collecting expeditions and later digitized
    as Valjean http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/valjean/.\r\nPossibly the other
    type in the drawer is also from Tubbs & Co.? I wonder if there is a Tubbs & Co.
    specimen book anywhere?\r\nDon"
