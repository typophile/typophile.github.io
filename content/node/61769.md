body: "Hi There,\r\n\r\nI've been asked to put together a corporate identity for a
  family friend. he's starting a new business and needs me to put together a complete
  corporate identity. As well as stationary, he's also going to need a brochure outlining
  service offering and website. \r\n\r\nAs far as layout and web goes thats something
  i'm very good at as i'm an artworker by trade. My weakest area is initial conceptual
  design, I need to come up with something professional, modern, clean, simple and
  friendly. This is my first concept and I needed some critique and advice to push
  me forward through the part I find most difficult.\r\n\r\nThe image added gives
  an overview of where I am at the moment, right now i'm struggling with using a mark
  or not. I want to stay away from cliche financial symbology and japanese influences.
  I want to kind of focus on 'growth' both for the company in terms of growing their
  business and the customer in growing their income.\r\n\r\nAny advice, inspiration
  and critique no matter how brutal would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prosperity.jpg]"

  body: "I think you've got a great start and the leaf and green certainly communicates
    'nature' and 'growth'. The ultimate challenge will be in the quick viewer thinking
    this is an environmental or agriculture company. Blue is popular in banking because
    of the psychology of color and it being tied with 'trust' and 'integrity'.\r\n\r\nSuper
    Technical: In the top logo the stem is on the left which makes the leaf appear
    to go down and to the right. Not sure you want to visually imply that for a financial
    company. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso the reversed logotype and tagline in that option is way
    too small.\r\n\r\nOne tip if you haven't done this... turn off the computer and
    grab a pencil and paper. Sketch out a bunch of different directions this can go
    and then eliminate the weakest concepts until you're left with 2-3 solid solutions.\r\n\r\nBeautiful
    work so far!"

  body: "If you are going to use a leaf (which i like, it breaks the mold of finance
    i think) direction is definitely important.  Like the person before me says, the
    line of the leaf stem seems to be going downward. \r\n\r\nId flip the leaf horizontally,
    so the stem is gradually going upwards.  This could represent even more growth,
    or moving forward.\r\n\r\nAlso, I agree that using a green leaf may initially
    cause viewers to expect an environmental company. But again, I like the idea of
    a leaf.  There could be a few possible fixes for this, such as changing the color
    of the leaf.  Making it a non traditional color could possibly disconnect it from
    the environmental image while still maintaining the strong leaf symbol. If that
    makes any sense. I hope it does.\r\n\r\nAs for the wordmark, I love the way it
    ties into everything.  I think the text works well.  Not completely organic, but
    it does seem somewhat friendly and free-flowing, while still maintaining the structure
    you might want as a financial group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in my previous post but the environmental slant also worried me. With regards
    to the leaf vein you couldn't have been more spot on I should have seen that myself
    :) Making the changes you mentioned alone makes a huge difference as you can see
    in the attached image. I'm gonna thrash on with this to see how far I can take
    it.\r\n\r\nThanks again and if anyone else feels like leaving anymore inspiration
    feel free.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prosperity_6124.jpg]"

    that same blue color, somehow it worked when it was green or the light blue but
    the medium and dark blue need that word darker."

  body: "Simple, clean, and professional. Big improvement and by flipping the leaf
    you get people to read from left to right as it moves their eye up, which helps
    communicate the \"growth\" aspect you're looking for. You also have a subtle leaf
    shape repeated in the descender of the \"y\". You also see it rotated 180 degrees
    in the \"e\". Nice.\r\n\r\nCan you explain the meaning of the period at the end
    of the wordmark? Not sure what to think about it... part of me feels it distracts
    and grabs attention but it's just a touch different.\r\n\r\nPsychology of Color:
    Blue\r\n\"Blue calls to mind feelings of calmness or serenity. It is often described
    as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.\r\n\r\nAsk people their favorite color
    and a clear majority will say blue. Much of the world is blue (skies, seas). Seeing
    the color blue actually causes the body to produce chemicals that are calming;
    but that isn't true of all shades of blue. Some shades (or too much blue) can
    send a cold and uncaring message. Many bedrooms are blue because it's calm, restful
    color. Over the ages blue has become associated with steadfastness, dependability,
    wisdom and loyalty (note how many uniforms are blue). People tend to be more productive
    in a blue room because they are calm and focused on the task at hand. Some studies
    are showing that weight lifters can lift more weight in a blue gym - in fact,
    nearly all sports are enhanced in blue surroundings.\"\r\n\r\nTell the client
    that is why you selected blue and you'll sound like a genius. ;)"

    colour version of the British Gas logo.\r\nBlue also conveys a cold feeling in
    my book. I also don't know anyone who has a blue bedroom. Unless they're six years
    old, and want it blue to support there team, or because they're a boy, and have
    a sister who's room is pink.\r\n\r\nIt also misses the fact that your graphic
    is a leaf, which grows.\r\nProsperity is about the light at the end of the tunnel.
    The golden sunrise, a promising future. Sorry but the blue is way too cold to
    convey that, maybe try making it a hint more green. As we perceive money to be
    green.\r\nI'm also unsure of the full stop."

    color comes in many different hues and values and means different things to different
    people. I didn't mean 'baby blue' when I provided the general psychology of blue.
    Personally, my bedroom is a dark shade of blue in the range of the following.\r\n\r\ntree.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanc_067_01_4176.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote:

    think about, full stop is removed it was kind of an accident initially but i left
    it in as it looked different and i couldn't decide whether i liked it or not.
    when i present this to the client i will definately give some varied examples
    for colour. i kind of want to stay in the blue green realm but colour at this
    point it is still very much undecided. These are the two final versions I will
    be presenting for this concept.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prosperity_final_6437.jpg]"

    worked pretty well for the text.  Id keep a gray example in with your color options
    you present. Good Work!

    jumped out at me first of all was that there is already a leaf in the \"y\". I
    would explore making that element the icon instead. \r\n\r\nThe current icon is
    a bit hysterical in size compared to the type, maybe reduce it a little?\r\n\r\nAlso
    it might be worth exploring a condensed typeface for the technical descriptor,
    maybe trade gothic condensed, or block gothic condensed, something neutral and
    sans serif anyway."
