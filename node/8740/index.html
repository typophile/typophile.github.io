<div class=commentbody>I like the top/left direction, but it would benefit if you could refine the weight distribution to make it look like its own letterform. Right now it's obviously very heavy on the right. You might try lightening the right side, adding a little weight to the left side and adjusting the horizontals accordingly. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>First, to help me to critic properly thoses sketches, it would have been essential to know in which sector you work. <br> <br>But , I could try to give you some basic critic.There are lots of good idea here. At my opinion, the first DB would be the one to have more chance to go somewhere, depend of course of your activity sector. The second, the third and the fifth remind me a bowling bowl. I suggest to work on the middle terminal of the B (center join), seems to sharp. Also, you could rotate the D to the right or to the left to get something like a diamond or lozenge. Thoses one with a drop shadow could give you a hard time to keep the white hairline clear at small size. <br> <br>Andr</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm leaning toward the top right one personally. I'd like to see that one with heavier serifs and thicker centre horizontal stroke. <br> <br>Does anyone else see shape of a black bird (even a dragon?), flying towards the right, formed by the bowls of that option? Maybe that could be expanded on. <br> <br>Funny you mention growing out of graff. I've recently been growing back into after about 15 years. I've been sketching a lot, and feeling the urge to paint more and more lately.</div>

<div class=commentbody>RE: Post 3, top revision <br> <br>I think the vertical stem is just a bit too heavy now, but this is much better. <br> <br>Have you tried making the upper bowl of the "B" smaller? This would require some reworking of the "D's" bowl also. <br> <br>Have you tried making the terminal of the "B" a little more subtle? In other words, create the "D", then just hint at the "B's" terminal, instead of making it so obvious. <br> <br>RE: Tagging <br> <br>So you're a graffiti artist that doesn't like color</div>

<div class=commentbody>Usually a logo will symbolizes or represents something about the given company for which it stands for. I am just wondering what the logo you have designed stands for. If it is purely for looks than I can't help you. If there is meaning behind it, than it will be easier to critique. In my personal opinion the better logos out there reflect something about the personality and meaning behind the particular company for which they stand for. <br>Anyway, only an opinion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>and i appreciate it. :-) <br> <br>do you feel that people looking at logos, i mean 'ordinary' people, 'little men', people who are not designers, see anything in a logo? <br> <br>from my experience, i think they don't, they just get a certain 'feel' or a 'vibe' from a logo, but i don't think it goes deeper that that for them . . . correct me if i'm wrong. <br> <br>as for designers, i think it's obvious taht they do look for something 'inside' the logo. and see it. <br> <br>i didn't want to transform this into nothing else but letters. i didn't want to make a pictogram or anything out of it . . . <br>so i guess i'm sticking to it. <br> <br>here are 2 new ideas, plus i am working on scott's suggestions<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63400.gif alt=new></div>

<div class=commentbody>I feel that one of our jobs as designers is to visually educate people with meaningful thoughtful sensitive design. One way to NOT do this is to remove the meaning all together. If there is no meaning you aren't educating anyone. <br> <br>For me it makes it difficult on the viewer to try to figure out why you combined the letterforms. Especially if there is no reason.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow! We're starting to get really philosophical over this. <br> <br>To David's point, an entity's logo should be purposeful. It should represent the entity that it is being designed for. <br> <br>In Dragan's defense, this logo's purpose is to represent his design business, possibly, but not necessarily, in a way that reflects his design style; hence, it is successful in that it is his initials (representing his business just as well as any business that is represented by names or initials) and it is designed by him (must show his style). I think his concept is solid, so it is his execution that will determine whether or not this is a successful logo in the end. <br> <br>Your concept in post 6 looks like a bed's footboard on its side. Of the concepts in the last post (7), I like the direction on the bottom, but now (your going to kill me for this) it's a little too subtle. Rather than reading a "B", I'm seeing a big pimple or mosquito bite. Try bringing back a little more of the stroke in that area so that the bump isn't so abrupt. Also, the terminal is a little too rounded. I think there's a good shape in there, it's just hiding in between a couple of your executions. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>A logo doesn't need to have any inherent meaning. It's simply a flag the company can wave. What's more important is consistency of use, how memorable the mark is, uniqueness in the market, 'vibe', etc. <br> <br>In fact, many logos fail because they try to posses too much lieteral meaning in them. <br> <br>IMHO, of course. <br> <br>Actually, I typed this before reading Scott's reply.

<div class=commentbody>Dragan, did you investigate trying the D and B on different plains of perspective? The D on a table top and the B sitting on it like a pitcher. Connected but apart. The monogram isn't doing anything for me. Another thought is if you took a lower case d and reflected it in a mirror you would have a b. Think out of the box</div>

<div class=commentbody>You could theoretically combine a "d" and a "b" all day long in a million different ways. Which way is the right way? <br>I ask myself simple question about the logos presented here. <br> <br>How do these logos visually represent that you are a graphic designer? <br> <br>To Darrel; <br>Don't you think a logo is more memorable if it has some underlying metaphor or meaning in it? I'm not talking about a literal meaning like you mentioned. I am talking more simplified, timeless and abstract. <br> <br>Here comes my sobering point of the day. <br>Graphic design firms with logos are limiting themselves. Why would you design a logo for a logo designing company? This might be to heady to talk about on this forum. Look at the logos of some the greatest design firms in the world. You will find that there is nothing tricky or contrived or forced about any of them. In fact, they have a certain consistency about them for a simple reason. They do to many different tasks as design firms to try and represent themselves with a single mark. Most of there logos are more like logotypes that just read simply and smoothly , no bells and whistles man. <br> <br>Again...only my opinion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wonder if you could capitalize either one or both of the letters in "the new one" logo from post 9. <br> <br>P.S. I really love the graffiti photos, especially 006. <br> <br> - Lex</div>

<div class=commentbody>The D looks a little distorted (as if it was flattened) maybe could play with the angle of the D a little more. Great concept.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Your last post show a real good way to go with your logo and a nice way to explore. The idea to use two typeface could be another idea to try. At my opinion, you must take in count of the width of your logo. He seems to be too wide. May be try to keep it in a square or in a circle. Good work. <br> <br>Andre</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry again Lauri, I will be more careful in the future. I usually don't like to post images because I don't want to influance the designer other than with words. We are visual types. But I couldn't explain this thought clearly</div>

<div class=commentbody>Daniel, <br> <br>No problem at all! I was just surprised that the image was only 2K big so I checked the file size and it turned out to be a little bigger than that. GIFs are sometimes surprisingly small since they use so few colors.</div>
