  body: 'Don''t know such a font. Possibly custom and heavily. Best I could say would
    be having a look to these 2 sections at DaFont [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]]. '

  body: It is not a font - it may have started as something based on type but it is
    now art - vector art as in an Adobe Illustrator file.
