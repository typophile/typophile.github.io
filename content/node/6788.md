body: 'Hi <BR> <BR>First post from a long-time lurker. I&#39;m looking for affordable,
  condensed sans serif typefaces with small caps and oldstyle figures. So far I&#39;ve
  found three: URW&#39;s Franklin Gothic T Condensed, John Sans Condensed, and Avenir
  Next Pro Condensed. I thought that Myriad Pro Condensed and Scala Sans Condensed
  were candidates, but they don&#39;t seem to have small caps. Can anyone suggest
  any others? <BR> <BR>I will be using the typeface for tables, captions and possibly
  subheads in technical reports that I write. It should complement Charter, which
  is my primary text face. Right now I&#39;m leaning towards URW&#39;s Franklin Gothic;
  John Sans and Avenir Next are very nice but don&#39;t seem such good companions
  for Charter. <BR> <BR>I know there are plenty of nice condensed faces which don&#39;t
  have small caps or oldstyle figures &#40;Gotham Condensed comes to mind&#41;, but
  I&#39;m a bit of a, er, freak about these things. <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot <BR> <BR>M'

    Futura would harmonise well with Charter. <BR> <BR>Since posting I&#39;ve found
    another candidate - Fedra Sans Condensed. This is v. nice but sadly out of the
    range of what I consider &#39;affordable&#39;. <BR> <BR>M

    target="_blank"> Apex Sans</a>? They seem to have a similar concept, though Apex
    Sans is somewhat smoother. By the way Apex Sans does have small caps and old style
    figures - in the link.

  body: I see what you mean! According to the blurb Meta Condensed is only 12% narrower
    than Meta Regular, which is itself 12% narrower than a &#39;normal&#39; sans.
    <BR> <BR>But isn&#39;t Meta a bit over-used, a bit &#39;90s&#39;? &#40;Not that
    I&#39;m particularly fashion-conscious, but I&#39;d like a face that dates well,
    like Charter.&#41; <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR> <BR>M

  body: I would definitely look at Meta. I know it is over-used. But for the sort
    of thing you are talking about &#40;lots of information at small sizes&#41; it
    really does shine, and it&#39;s got plenty of weights, different kind of figures
    and so on. It&#39;s not as if you are going to be using it for masses of text,
    or for &#34;corporate identity&#34; purposes or anything. I use it a lot for purposes
    like yours, and have had positive typographic feedback from colleagues who don&#39;t
    normally notice fonts at all, of the &#34;What is that nice font&#34; sort. That
    might be a bad sign, of course, but at least they don&#39;t think its Arial. <BR>
    <BR>I haven&#39;t ever paired it with Charter, but i don&#39;t see why it shouldn&#39;t
    work pretty well, and it might be better than Franklin &#40;which is hardly an
    under-used type itself&#41;.

  body: '&#62;over-used <BR> <BR>It may be over used by designers, but not as a font
    seen by the public in the US anyway. It is just now becoming quite common. I agree
    that it is also very good. You could also consider FF Unit, a bit more rigid version
    of Meta, which does have small caps.'

    Problem is, Praxis is not condensed, and although Praxis Light sets quite tightly

    preferably in the condensed line. <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR> <BR>M
