		<div class="commentbody">okay, i'll try this again&hellip; <BR>our staff here at the Winslow Mail is in the process of giving our paper a facelift and i've been assigned the task of giving some guidance to this transformation. (that's kinda scary) <BR>First on our list is to rework the mast head, the current one is pretty atrocious, i'll post it for you. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25543.jpg" alt="Current masthead">  <BR>So my publisher wanted me to come up with several designs that we'll let our readers choose from to be the final nameplate. I was looking through old editions and found that the             paper's header kept going back and forth between different blackletter designs and a more simple, serif design, lemme show you what i mean&hellip;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25544.gif" alt="Header from 1913"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25545.gif" alt="Nameplate from 1930"> <BR>I really like this blackletter and am thinking of cleaning it up for one of my designs, another blackletter face i'd like to see head our paper is Agincourt (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=agincourt" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=agincourt">http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=agincourt</a></a>) , but i'm worried that that may be a bit too fussy, but i'm a sucker for blackletter, so i need a more balanced opinion. For some other designs i need a face that's classy, simple, clean, but still has some personality. Any suggestions are welcome. <BR>Evenutally i'm hoping we'll change our body type and the type for headers and would appreciate any suggestions there as well. I took a look at fontbureau's fonts for newspapers last nite and none of them really grabbed me and that's about as far as i've researched thus far. Anyhow, thanks for your interest and any suggestions/feedback.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i knew i could count on you to pull though for me, hrant. lemme see if i can answer your questions adequately: <BR>1) Our target demographic is the residents of Winslow, AZ and perhaps reaching into Joseph City (my hometown, yay!) Winslow is an old railroad town and i guess most of the citizenship either be classified as bluecollar or small business owners (in my estimation). <BR>2) Currently our whole paper is set in Times (shudder!) and i think it's time that be remedied. Lemme upload this week's front page for ya.<!--attachment: 01_02-04-04_pdf-25570.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-stuffit*1207.3*This+week%26%2339%3bs+front+page*01+02%2d04%2d04%2epdf%2esit --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif" align=left alt="application/x-stuffit">This week's front page<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/01_02-04-04_pdf-25570.unk" target="_blank"><b>01 02-04-04.pdf.sit</b></a> (1207.3 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--> <BR>3) abt the authority, we're a small operation here in Winslow. currently i work doing ad design for the Winslow Mail and our sister publication, the Reminder. but our editor (who currently does ALL the layout) is moving back to TX and there is some chance that i may become responsible for layout of the paper. No matter what happens, though, i'm adamant that we sever our ties with Times and find something fresh. <BR>I kinda like the Cheltenham (thanks for the ID) mast myself, but would like to see something with a bit more sophistication. We are, however, trying to become &quot;the paper for the people&quot; and want it to have more of a hometown feel, so i don't want to do something too far removed from the people we're trying to reach. (did i put in enough inconsistencies there?) anyhow all suggestions are welcome. Thnx again!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Paul. <BR> <BR>I will start with the familiar disclaimer that I've never designed a newspaper. <BR> <BR>Some questions to ask: Is it a small town paper? Should it look like a small town paper? Do readers want it to look like a small town paper? <BR> <BR>The implications of this are many. For example, the NYT doesn't have any advertising on the font cover. Should that be a priority? Even if there must be ads on the front page, I would lobby hard to remove them from the masthead. <BR> <BR>On the masthead: You are dealing with people who are comfortable with 3D photoshopped type, a waving american flag, a local statue (i assume), and a big 50 cent. So moving back to a purely typographic masthead may be a stretch for them. I'd definitly loose the flag. And the large 50 cent (everyone in winslow knows that). If the statue is in fact a Winslow landmark, I would consider keeping it (or some other town landmark) and using it in a <b>Winslow (statue) Mail</b> configuration. Make it an engraved or scratchboard looking illustration, not a photograph</div>

Maybe she wants to think she lives in The Big City instead of a small town&hellip; In which case show her the NYT with its Cheltenham! :-) If she's gonna insist on something more elegant and contemporary, then something like Swift would be great, yes. But I'd try to keep the feel homey, so maybe something like Cheltenham but not as mushy. <BR> <BR>But I wouldn't use Cheltenham for body, it's too old and small on the body. Wait a second: I never thought I'd recommend the otherwise abominable ITC Cheltenham, but for news body (at a small enough size, like maybe 8 point) its obese x-height might just click. Maybe give that a shot. <BR> <BR>For Cheltenham I was thinking more for the masthead.

If you like it I can give you an EPS of those settings. But the font itself (which is actually designed as a newspaper text face, in four weights with italics) will cost you&hellip;  :-) <BR> <BR>&gt; I would lobby hard to remove [the ads] from the masthead.  <BR> <BR>Failing that at least don't allow color ads above the masthead line. <BR> <BR>BTW, this might sound like blasphemy, but don't jeopardize the redesign by trying force a font sale.

		<div class="commentbody">hey hrant, thanks again! <BR>yeah the ITC version of Cheltenham was what i was looking at last night. I think most our body text is set at 10pts, you think it would work at that size? <BR>We do have some decent alternatives already (perhaps) but i'm none too keen on the intricacies of the text face (i'm more of a display type of guy) Last night i was playing with that front page and and tried using Hoefler Text, Joanna, Georgia, Garamond, Galiard, Goudy just to see how these faces would look. Georgia is a personal favorite of mine (and it's based off of Miller isn't it?) But the rest i didn't really feal comfortable with, except maybe Hoefler Text. <BR>About the ads&hellip; i totally agree that they should go below the nameplate,  personally i would like to see no ads above the fold, but i don't know what the advertiser's contract is. <BR>About the statue.. his name's &quot;Easy&quot; from the Eagle's song &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and the one line that says &quot;I was standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona&hellip;&quot; I was wanting to make him more graphic instead of having a photo of him, but again, my publisher doesn't want to see him in the nameplate (because of local politics, you know how it goes in a small town) But i may still do one mock up with him in there.  Alternatively other graphic elements I could use are the railroad or perhaps Route 66.  <BR>Just for fun i'll upload a few more nameplates that i found while digging through our archives.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25690.gif" alt="The original in 1897"> <BR>My publsiher liked this blackletter. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25691.gif" alt="Nameplate 1927"> <BR>i like the nostalgic feel of this one, although i'm not sure whether the train station is the heart of the city (maybe i should stick the local Wal-Mart in there instead, LOL) <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25692.gif" alt="Nameplate 1936"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25693.gif" alt="Nameplate 1942"> <BR>A couple rail inspired motifs. <BR>Oh and i forgot to mention, Winslow is on the border of the Navajo reservation and we're trying to appeal to that audience as well, however i don't really wanna see an overtly southwestern/native design scheme. keep the comments coming, i'm getting some good ideas!</div>

So my thoughts are based on personal visual preference. <BR> <BR>* * * <BR> <BR>Paul &ndash; Are you trying to soften the body text? Is this why you like Cheltenham?  <BR> <BR>What about <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1076014752645966&amp;fontname=Miller" target="_blank">Miller</a> from Font Bureau? It has both text and display versions, and it is wonderful to use. <BR> <BR>Or how about <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal" target="_blank">Le Monde Journal</a> from JFP at Typofonderie? <BR> <BR>Personally, I would avoid Joanna, for instance the counter in the 'a' is too tiny (IMHO) for the news, and there isn't enough contrast. <BR> <BR>Randy's idea of incorporating a woodcut or engraving is nice, but I would probably opt for the flag and not the statue. The statue looks as if you need all of it, and the shape it creates isn't very interesting. <BR> <BR>Agincourt is nice, I like the blackness of it.  <BR> <BR>You might also research the newspaper work of Roger Black.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I don't know anything about newspaper design, except that it is a whole art in itself.  <BR> <BR>If you have any budget to buy some fonts, I would call Fontbureau and talk to whomever is their resident expert on newspapers. The 'Readibility' series - 9 different fonts each with a range of weights - is specifically for newspapers, and something designed to purpose is probably going to end up looking a lot better. They have a PDF of it you can download it and print it out, and have the phone number for this on their site. I'm sure they can clue you in on what will work for your paper stock, press, budget, etc.  <BR> <BR>The Gerard Unger stuff is also a great idea, and designed and proven for newspapers. You could e-mail him and maybe even phone. Start on his web site <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.gerardunger.com">www.gerardunger.com</a></a>  <BR> <BR>After talking or e-mailing both you will have a way better idea of what your options are. <BR> <BR>By the way, Cheltenham for text is a terrible idea IMHO. Its ascenders are way too tall for newspaper text. Fine for Titles, as the NYT uses it; it is narrow, dark and long extenders - that fits the narrow columns they use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here's some free amateur opinion, probably worth what it costs, based on your PDF of the front page.  <BR> <BR>I don't think fonts are your main problem. Times New Roman was eventually changed by the Times itself, but it a very good face, if your paper is not too rough. (The sharp points on the serifs melt if the paper is not good enough, I understand.) <BR> <BR>I suspect you can make the paper look a lot better even with Times as the body text. First, I would look at how the Times (of London) itself used to use it for a clue. <BR> <BR>I suspect that you have too much leading in the body text, and that tightening it would make give the paper more even 'color' and a more professional look. (Also, your font size may be too big for the narrow columns.) Second, Times bold isn't the best as a headline font, but if you use it, I suspect it should be tracked negatively for large headlines, so you get a bolder, more punchy look. <BR> <BR>Finally, all the centered text in the blue box on the left is a definite no-no, as it is way less readable, and there should never be over a few lines centered.  <BR> <BR>I would think that with a new masthead and headline font, and improvement of the typography, you could make the whole thing look quite good, even with Times.  <BR> <BR>Another more radical revision to think about is having fewer columns. I believe the NYT has the six columns. Narrow columns as less desirable from the point of view of readability, but that way NYT can start a lot of stories on the front page, with headlines - in the narrow, tall Cheltenham. However, you have your headlines going across a number of columns, so that the many columns doesn't particularly help you. <BR> <BR>As I said, I am just blathering about this stuff without knowledge, but anyway these are the kinds of questions you can ask about revising your present design.  <BR> <BR>There is a <a href="http://www.snd.org/" target="_blank">Society for Newspaper Design</a> and on their site they have a searchable list of books on newspaper design, including books of award winning designs. If you call them they can probably tell you of a whole division of small town weeklies, and you can talk to your colleagues who are in a similar situation, and get practical, valuable advice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thnx for all your suggestions, folks, a little more insight into our opperation (just fyi) we're small, really small, at most we'd need a licence for 5 workstations, at least two, but i figger most licences cover at least 5 stations, so i'm safe there. <BR>william i totally agree with you that there are more problems than just fonts. personally i'd like to take all ads out the face plate. my publisher wants a big, bold headline each week that runs across the page, i'm thinking i would like to widen the leftmost column for quick reads and weather and contact info and an index, that would narrow the columns to the right, i'd definately do something about the leading, and there's no way i'm sticking with times for the body text and definately not for headlines, but then i'm getting WAAAAAAY ahead of myself. i've been thinking i should talk to my sister who does page layout for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer *lightbulb goes on* but we have conflicting schedules and i haven't been able to get a hold of her yet this week. then i can talk shop with her about body type, headlines, layout, etc. for now i'm gonna just worry about the nameplate. thank you all for your insight and for pointing out useful resources. i'm gonna go start drafting some heads for the paper!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think ITC Cheltenham might actually work for news text (8-9 pt), but only if you track it a bit looser - which will make it lighter too. And note that Times is actually a bit light for news in today's repro conditions (especially at smaller sizes). So don't conclude that ITC Cheltenham is too dark based on a comparison with Times, or seen at 24 point, or from laser prints (which make type darker). <BR> <BR>(I can't believe I'm defending that monstrosity! But I guess any font has its use&hellip; Even Helvetica.) <BR> <BR>&gt; FB has put Whitman on the newspaper font list. <BR> <BR>That makes no sense. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul one more thought, in any publishing business the editors know how many words they need to fill a certain amount of space. So your editor has a feel for managing the writers telling them to write to a certain number of words. If you change the text face make sure the characters per pica is almost exactly the same as Times or you might get some resistance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, good point. And Times isn't easy to beat. In fact the best way to beat it is to use a WIDER font with a bigger x-height, so you can set it smaller and with less -total- leading. The CPP will be worse than Times for a give point size, but the overall surface area used by the other font in a <i>small</i> point size will be less (without losing on apparent size), at least for news text (which has a lot of linebreaks - which negates the space savings of narrow designs like Times). <BR> <BR>BTW, check out these: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW%2BMAIL&amp;p=72" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72</a></a> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow%2BMail&amp;p=72" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72</a></a> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW%2BMAIL&amp;p=72" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW&amp;#43;MAIL&amp;amp;p=72</a></a> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow%2BMail&amp;p=72" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow&amp;#43;Mail&amp;amp;p=72</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, so as not to hijack Ben's post, I'll put my response here. Yer quite right about Whitman &amp; Bliss as a good alternative to Joanna &amp; Gill Sans. I see a strong resemblance between these pairs, but it looks like your face is much less &quot;horsey&quot; than Joanna. You brought Whitman up earlier in this post of mine, and i'm just curious as to why you don't think it'd work for newspaper (I'm still trying to learn what makes a good paper text face and what doesn't, so some commentary would be enlightening). I'll hafta remember Whitman for future projects tho. <BR>Oh and so's ya'll know&hellip; We had a corporate shake up th'other week and I kept my job, yay! In a month or so I'll be doing all the layout and design for the Winslow Mail (scary huh?) Now that I've got the name plate slapped on there I'm gonna start pushing for better text fonts. I'd really like to use Miller and am putting some pressure on my new publisher to make it happen for me. Last week I used Folio Bold condensed for our main story's headline, but I'm not sure that that's exactly what I want for that type of thing. Another Headline font I'd like to get is Azuza by Parkinson <a href="http://typedesign.com/fonts/azuzam.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://typedesign.com/fonts/azuzam.html">http://typedesign.com/fonts/azuzam.html</a></a>. <BR>So what does everybody think of this combo: Miller for text, Azuza for headlines and (Your Suggestions Go Here) for a good, solid, sans for main headlines. <BR>P.S. Anyone know of any good books that deal with newspaper design (I checked out your link, William, but it gave me too many suggestions for books, i'd like to have 2-5 good recommendations to look at) I picked up a copy of The Essentials of Typographic Design, but I haven't gotten that far into the book to know if it'll help me (directly) in this area. <BR>Anyhow, thnx again for listening!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joanna is horsey?! We must be using the term very differently. <BR> <BR>From what I gather, to his credit Kent doesn't think Whitman can be used for news setting. I think it's great for some book work as well as magazines. <BR> <BR>Azuza is one of my most favorite recent fonts, and I think it would go great with a news version of Whitman. Miller of course is a superb design as well, and seems like it would pair very well with Azuza. BTW, Paul, did you get my private email concerning Patria? It's a news face, and might work well for you too. <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>I myself haven't found a book dealing specifically with news fonts, but check out all the wonderful stuff on news typography written by Paul Hunt. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">hey Hrant, no, i didn't get your email :^(  I'll hafta take a look at Patria. I guess Joanna isn't really horsey, I just wanted to make sure you were reading! I was just trying to say that Whitman takes the beauty of Joanna and softens it up by turning the slab serifs to wedges, i think those slab serifs of Joanna's are it's only real drawback to making it more versatile. So does Whitman not work for news just because of the stock? <BR>In the way of books, I'm not looking for something on fonts so much as something that would give me some guidelines for good layout practices.  <BR>But i must say i am disappointed you didn't suggest something for a complimentary sans! thnx for yer comments, hrant, i always 'preciate  yer opinion.</div>

News point sizes are on the small end, and those require bigger bodies that are darker (as well as wider and looser). <BR> <BR>That said, I think Whitman is a natural for adaptation to news setting: it has a superb balance of warmth and neutrality, plus great readabilty. <BR> <BR>Companion sans: maybe look at stuff by Unger and de Groot. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Patria: I think you might be pleasantly surprised by its combination of austerity, readability, and setting economy, especially for the point size range you're looking at. Since I've yet to see it in actual news setting action (high speed presses, bad stock, etc.) we might be able to work out some sort of trial scheme - just let me know. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul &ndash; <BR> <BR>Regarding Whitman and newspapers: Hrant pretty much summed it up. The proportions are all wrong. Too much of the body is given over to the ascenders and descenders. This is primarily what marks it as a book typeface. There are also a few technical considerations, like various details which would become ink traps on newsprint. I don't necessarily agree with Hrant about the wider and looser part (but that's a legitimate debate). <BR> <BR>Advice that I received recently on this very topic: &quot;My advice about newspaper types is that to remember they are set in very narrow columns. So think dense compact lines. But not condensed or squeezed. It is tricky.&quot; <BR> <BR>I recently spent a little time on a rough draft of a Whitman News for newspaper text. I wasn't completely satisfied with the results. The project has been put back on a back burner. <BR> <BR>Coincidentally, however, a newspaper customer has requested development of some condensed display weights of Whitman for headlines.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Patria is <i>still</i> not ready for full release. :-/ I know what I need to fix, but it needs to be one big push (just like the first iteration was back when) so I need to be able to allocate a big enough block of undisturbed time. The biggest problem in the current version is the serif structure in the caps. Even so, I actually sold a copy last year to somebody who used it to superb effect: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/SGS.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/SGS.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/SGS.gif</a></a> <BR>(Paired with Carter's Mantinia.) <BR> <BR>This is one reason I'd offer a trial scheme (basically because I'd like to have actual newsprint of it in action), but since it would be a &quot;one-off&quot; deal I'd rather not discuss it in public.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, all i can say is good luck. It's a fun process but a  <BR>tricky one as well. <BR> <BR>Looks like you've made good progress so far Paul. I can't  <BR>give you anymore advice on type that the experts here  <BR>haven't already said. But a few resources for you to check <BR>out in consideration to newspaper design. <a href="http://www.newspagedesigner.com">NewspageDesigner</a>  <BR>is wonderful. Get to see what other news and  <BR>magazine designers are putting out around the country.  <BR>Easily the best resource out there for people dealing with <BR>newspaper design. I would also recomend &quot;Seeing the  <BR>Newspaper&quot; by Kevin Barnhurst. I have just started reading  <BR>it and it has some good tips/ideas. It was recomended to  <BR>me by a newspaper man (photographer, designer,  <BR>journalist) with 35+ years of experience in the business. <BR> <BR>I can't say it enough, but just look at other newspapers. Find <BR>ones that you like and enjoy then follow them for a while.   <BR>Some of my favorites, as far as design go, are the Orange County <BR>Register, Hartford Courant, Seatle Post Intelligencer, Wisonsin <BR>State Journal just to mention a few. If you need more, I have <BR>about another dozen i could give you to look at. <BR> <BR>Oh, and i forgot. Check out <a href="http://www.garcia-media.com">Mario Garcia</a>. Some people think  <BR>his stuff has become a bit too similar in newspaper design of <BR>late, but many people still bow down before him. <BR> <BR>Hope some of these suggestions help. Good luck and remember <BR>to have fun.</div>
