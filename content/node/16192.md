  or efforts at categorizing typefaces, were published? I'm interested mostly in texts
  other than catalogs or promotional materials from foundries, and any texts by historians.
  Dates and titles of early books would be very helpful. I'll be researching in libraries
  soon but thought some of you might have some recommendations and ideas. Thanks...

  body: "Have a look at Stanley Morison 'On the classification of typographical variations'
    in Morison: Letter Forms (available as paper back). This article is also in John
    Dreyfus: Type Specimen Facsimiles 1-15\r\n\r\nMind you, this is a not a history
    of the design of letterforms or an analysis of historical letter forms, but rather
    a historical account of the first attempts to analyze and classify letter forms.
    Quite a different topic."
