body: "Ken Bessie, Lex Kominek, and I had the second Calgary Typophile meet-up last
  night at a conveniently located pub, where we were faced with the sign below.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beer-ad-serif_6433.jpg]\r\n\r\nMuch
  to the amusement of the other people with whom we were sharing a table, we tried,
  unsuccessfully, to identify this face: heck, it even stumped Lex!  (No, we hadn't
  had that many beers either.)\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that the kerning leaves
  a fair bit to be desired (and what's with those periods?), would someone else like
  to take a stab at this one?\r\n\r\n(And if you're in Calgary and want to come along
  to the next event, ask one of us for details.)"
