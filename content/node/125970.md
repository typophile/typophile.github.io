body: "I'm doing some work for this company, Blaze, and have been asked to recreate
  the style of lettering used in the logo. Apparently nobody there knows which font
  was used for the wordmark. \r\n\r\nOf course, it's been modified, but any help finding
  a match to the original is much appreciated!\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: The base for the logo looks like Contax Pro (55 Regular) from TypeInnovations,
    and then the gaps removed.
