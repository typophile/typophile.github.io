  the headline font have to be so BIG and so BOLD????]] thread:\r\n<cite>\"to my knowledge
  has spent the last two days solid rebuilding the database from scratch because of
  some incompatiblity issues with our server and the new version of Drupal.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
  THOUGHT that it somehow seemed familiar! I've been working with a few Drupal installs
  myself, and I noticed a few subtle things like the formatting info and the file
  attachments info below the editing field looked the same. I've just never done a
  side by side comparison.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Typophile seems to be the most advanced
  Drupal layout I've ever seen, and certainly the best implementation of a forum module.\r\n\r\nCan
  we Jared Benson to comment a little bit about working with Drupal, with possibly
  hints for others working with the software?"
