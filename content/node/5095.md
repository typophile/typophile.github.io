  body: ' Pretty cool idea! The only problem I see is that the diagonals are too light.
    BTW, you might consider making a filled-in version of the font, so that people
    can layer the patterned one over it, in different colors. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    historical roots. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anything like it in the bitmap
    stuff being designed these days... '

  body: Reminds me of old American cross-stitching! Great. <BR> <BR>I also like Hrant&#39;s
    idea. That could prove very interesting at larger scales &#40;200%, 300%, etc.&#41;

  body: ' Wow, that&#39;s a beauty! <BR> <BR>The only other comment I&#39;ll make
    is that the u&amp;lc V and W &#40;and to a lesser extent, uc Y&#41; look backward
    in their stress. Was that intensional, to have the heavier strokes on the right
    side as opposed to the more traditional left side? <BR> <BR>It does add an interesting
    quirk, so I&#39;m not entirely sure that it&#39;s a bad thing. '

  body: ' Superb work. Very original. I&#39;m not a fan of the trend towards teeny
    tiny fonts on web pages, but this one proves that it&#39;s possible to make something
    beautiful out of just a handfull of pixels. <BR>Now that it has been pointed out,
    those V and W stresses look wrong to me, and I think I&#39;d prefer it done the
    normal way. '

  body: 'Thanks a lot for all your comments and consultings! <BR>  I&#39;ve changed
    the Uc V and W cause it was not intentional &#40;thanks David!&#41; and it works
    better like this; and made a wide version of the Uc. <BR>  I work on kerning settings
    now because fixed letterspacing doesn&#39;t work. <BR>  The five last chars VWXYZ
    are really refractory to the grid constraints so they seems strange in the reg
    and wide version: I&#39;m waiting for a pixel miracle. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/754.gif"
