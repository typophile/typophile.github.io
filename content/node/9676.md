  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hand-drawn, but the font used looks it&#39;s an
    amateur job. The &#39;i&#39; in the white lettering is a different weight than
    the other letters, as if it was borrowed from another font. <BR> <BR>Do you need
    to duplicate this, or do you like the typeface?  Maybe we can suggest something
    similar, if you don&#39;t need to have this exact font.

    alt=""> <BR> <BR>And no, I don&#39;t need this exact font; I just loved the feeling
    it gave me, especially in its original setting, of, &#34;hey, I&#39;m going to
    the BEACH this weekend!&#34; If you can suggest something closer than what I&#39;ve
    found, I&#39;d be most grateful.'

  body: Methinks Ray Larabie strikes again. The image muddies up <BR>details a bit,
    but it appears to be <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/fonts/e.html" target="_blank">
    Effloresce Bold</a>.

  body: Sounds good, but just send &#39;em to Ray! <BR> <BR>I was about to suggest
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/seagull/" target="_blank"> Seagull</a>
    for a font that squawks BEACH.
