  body: 'Not to me. Just checked it out. ITC Century is different. Designed by Tony
    Stan, it has the trademarked large x-height. Bitstream Schoolbook and New Century
    Schoolbook look very similar. I can''t tell you the differences. In "Typographically
    Speaking" Matthew Carter only credits himself for the Greek version of New Century
    Schoolbook. '

    some additional work on it after WW2...

  body: 'Linn Boyd Benton designed the metal ''Century''. His son Morris Fuller Benton
    designed a number of variations, including ''Century Schoolbook''. The father
    invented the pantographic punch cutter, but the son was the better type designer.
    Who worked on the digital versions is not clear on the web sites. '

  body: "The big differences are the misssing serif on the lowercase h, m, n in the
    ITC.\r\n\r\nThe color of ITC Century is not good at smaller text sizes.\r\nHowever,
    its Light weight is really cool at larger text sizes (eg 14 pt), especially the
    italic."

    Low DeVinne (1829--1914), printer of <em>The Century</em> magazine, designed a
    stronger, bolder and more readable face for the magazine and commissioned Linn
    Boyd Benton (1844--1932) of ATF to cut it.\r\n\r\nL.B. Benton cut it on the newly
    invented Benton punch-cutting machine and in 1895 was christened Century Roman.
    Afterwards, a companion face was created for ATF by L.B. Benton: Century no. 2,
    later called Century Broad-face. This face became the basis for Century Expanded,
    designed by L.B.'s son, Morris Fuller Benton in 1902. Over the course of three
    more years, the italic, bold and bold italics were developed.\r\n\r\nThen after
    a few more years, Morris Fuller Benton developed Century Oldstyle.\r\n\r\n<em>\"While
    the essential appearance of Century Roman and Century Expanded derived from Bodoni
    and Didot, that of Century Oldstyle seems to have been based on Caslon.\"</em>
    -- Paul Shaw\r\n\r\nIn 1915, redevelopment of Oldstyle face began and was renamed
    Century Book.\r\n\r\nSoon after, ATF was approached by Ginn & Co., the textbook
    publisher, with a request for a new typeface for schoolbooks. M.F. Benton began
    review of research done at Clark University on the relationship between the legibility
    of type and the eyesight of children.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Benton increased the
    space between letter, the x-height of each letter, and the weight of each stroke,
    and balanced the color of the type by opening up the counters. The result was
    Century Schoolbook, completed in 1919.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 ATF commissioned Charles
    E. Hughes to design a new proportion for Century Expanded... the result, Century
    Nova, which was more condensed.\r\n\r\nUnder license from ATF, Tony Stan designed
    the sixteen weight ITC Century family between 1975 and 1980 for International
    Typeface Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this summary is from\r\nTHE CENTURY
    FAMILY\r\nan article by Paul Shaw for <em>Fine Print</em> magazine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    of Merganthaler Linotype based on Century Schoolbook, long after the Benton''s
    had passed on. It was the second face, after New Baskerville, that was digitized
    and expanded using Ikarus (digital technology). The Bitstream version is a near
    exact copy, only being moved from a 54 unit to a 2000 or so unit design. '
