body: "My application recently got denied for a masters in type design program. I
  learned from one of the jurors/professors that my portfolio needed to be 'less pragmatic
  and ordinary commissioned work'. He further noted that they were looking for work
  that contained more personal and experimental projects. This was my first time applying
  for a masters program and I unfortunately created my portfolio based on projects
  that I've done as an in-house graphic designer.\r\n\r\nI want to reapply for the
  program next year but before I do, I want to ensure that I know how to best approach
  the creation of my new portfolio. \r\n\r\nQuestion: \r\nThat said, would it be a
  total faux-pas to reach out to the professor again, the one who had already taken
  the time to give me his feedback, --to see if I can get a tour of his school and
  request to see their student mid-term critiques? The last thing I want to do is
  come off like I'm brown-nosing in any way. Thoughts anyone?"

  body: It is one thing to "get to know the program better" and another to "brown
    nose". As long as you are doing the former I see no reason why it is a bad idea.
    Insight is helpful. But I also agree with Craig in that they have made a suggestion
    that you should do.

  body: "awesome. thank you both for your time and insight. i have received 2 other
    replies regarding this, one stressed the highest of importance in introducing
    myself to the school and observing student portfolios, the other countered the
    first. i find it interesting that it was the student of business who challenged
    the advice from the professor of art --that it would be best to ultimately let
    my work speak for itself. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "It seems that you failed to sufficiently entertain the professors presenting
    your work. You got answered \u201Cyou\u2019re not sexy enough\u201D \u2013 not:
    \u201Cyou would still have to learn a bit more before getting enrolled\u201D.
    Think about that seriously before turning back to them again.\r\n\r\nThe name
    of the school \u2013 ?  ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, as a student it is entirely up to you
    to define what you want to learn. A good teacher will then pick you up where you
    are now, not saying \u201Cdo this before I talk to you\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn any case
    you\u2019re welcome to attend the \u201CTypophile Academy\u201D. No entrance fee,
    no peeping tutors. Just put your work in the \u203ACritique\u2039 section and
    you\u2019ll get helped."

    certainly given me more to think about and one thing is for sure, however i might
    arrive at furthering my education, it is certainly going to be an intriguing process
    and I tend to embrace its every step. '
