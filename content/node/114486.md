body: "I'm currently working on the arabic block of my font and since I don't speak,
  read nor write arabic language(s), I suddently felt concerned about the design.\r\nI
  know the way it is written and how glyphs join, etc., give meaning to the words
  and phrases but, if I take some liberties when drawing the glyphs, could it result
  in something offensive? Something that could enrage the people using that language?
  I feel worried about it, very very worried. I mean no disrespect. I never would!
  That's unthinkable to me! So, if I flatten a curve a little or round it a bit more
  for it to fit the general design of this font, could it result in something awful?
  Please help!\r\nThis is the first time I try to fill all the blocks of a font and
  my font has no 45\xB0 angles. No straight lines at 45\xB0 angles. So I round some
  segments a little, or straighten them. Could this be a problem for the nature of
  arabic calligraphy?\r\nThanks in advance."

      and the caps height. I used different heights loop height, tooth height, descender
      1 and descender 2. Maybe looks like that because it's out of context without
      the latin letters in the image. Anyway, I hope someone likes it when it's finished.

    I chose the largest whose diameter is double the line width. Legibility would
    demand an even bigger circle than that. And if the slant is more than 45 degrees
    the circumscribed circle would be larger still compared to the verticals, but

    sans-serification of scripts all over the world is a real phenomena and a good
    one and it happened to Japanese, Thai, etc. Since then a whole generation of typographers
    were educated also in Beirut, (cutting and pasting Latin letters as I heard to
    create Arabic letters as a design excercise).  So a sort of Latinized Arabic with
    little regard for what I consider the traditional essence of the letter shapes
    is now fashionable. The result are now elegant professional fonts where the letter

    of shape variations are two big symptoms of the disease of Latinized Arabic, but
    there are others... The good news is that when Arabic is Latinized it's usually
    very obvious, hence easy to combat; Armenian is much closer to Latin in many ways,
    so the damage is less but it's also harder to fight... The two big symptoms are
    an inflated \"x-height\" and too many serifs.\r\n\r\nConcerning the invention
    of Armenian, the only formal account we have comes from Mesrop Mashdots's star
    student, Goryune (which BTW is the name my wife and I gave our middle son :-)
    but he's relatively clear: Mashdots was commissioned by King Vramshabouh (oh,
    our youngest son's name is Vram :-) to invent the alphabet in order to combat
    cultural assimilation. This is why Mashdots did not base the Armenian alphabet
    on existing scripts. However the scribes who ended up writing in the new script
    were used to Greek, so they made it more like Greek. But, a caveat: I wasn't there.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe
    reason marking the black cannot yield an optimal black/white relationship is that
    it forces a relationship between the two edges of the black; so no matter how
    much you want to respect the white, you cannot do so optimally. The parallel I
    like to draw is with Jefferson and Sally Hemmings: he loved her, but she was still

    little attention to the process of creation and origins. When I started working

    or 16-segment display and didn't want to go the dot-matrix way. I imagined a more
    \"designed display\" to show numbers with more quality, yet keeping the 16-segment
    approach, and so StarCo Round started to form in my mind. When I started the font

  body: "AzizMostafa: You are so kind in your words. Thank you!\r\nVladimir: I have
    never seen an electronic display showing indic numerals. That sounds awesome!!
    Mine was intended for a weather system I did for my thesis. Here it is the \"inception\"
    of StarCo Round:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Round evolution Small_5252.jpg]\r\nI
    must admit I am very intrigued by your display for indic numerals. Mine was an
    idea I presented to the jury: why do electronic displays have to look ugly? why
    not make a display with graphic design as basis, instead of just showing information,
    but keeping it efficient from the electronics point of view? I hope one day to
    see it manufactured with an exotic technique like neon tubes. :)\r\n\r\nI've been
    busy at my job but in the free times I can get, I do minor changes. I know it
    still has its details but I managed to enlarge the dots and give space to some
    letters. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArabicTestSmall_6520.jpg]\r\nSo,
    I assume the neckless final form that was mentioned is for the letter I marked
    in blue? I'll think of it. I must admit, the larger dots look way better!"

      \ in the 1950's and later Mawaqef, in Beirut who wanted to - they thought -
      reintroduce \"Arabic\" letters to the Arab world - the indic numerals are disappearing
      from text and billboards, chequebooks and so on. Pity I really like them.\r\nYour
      display numerals are nice the 5 is a bit confusing at first because it looks
      like an inverted 2.  The ones I was referring to are 7-segment (not 8!, a mental
      slip because when they are all lit it shows 8) LCD displays.  Here is a variation
      I found on Wikipedia:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sixteen-segment_display_animated.gif\r\n\r\nI
      like your final yeh swan shape. I think you will find that words with repeated
      dots will cause overlap id you retain the wide separation of the 2 dots in the
      medial teh . \r\nGood luck \r\n"

  body: "I have changed the number 2 since that initial idea because of that.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Round
    2-5 evolution Small_5962.jpg]\r\nThe 16-segment alphanumeric display, like that
    shown on wikipedia's gif is exactly why I wanted to change to a more stylized
    design. In real life the 16-segment display makes some letters look ugly because
    it's physically difficult to make the segments touch completely in points where
    many are touching, like the center of the star. So letters like X, W, V, etc.,
    look confusing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letter X_6648.jpg]\r\nSo,
    following the likes of Nixie tubes, I thought of the numerals you see keeping
    the 16-segment count but with a nicer appearance. After the project I couldn't
    help thinking an entire font could be made with this style and I started StarCo
    Round.\r\nYes, I've seen the dots are overlapping and I will adjust to avoid it.
    I'd like to understand how much space should exist between letters in arabic and
    although I've spaced the Alif and Lam-Alif ligature to make it more readable,
    I haven't found how much space give between other letters. But I keep reading
    about it :)"

    Kill the spaces to the right of all.\r\n2. Kill the spaces to the left of R and
    its dotted twin (Z).\r\n3. Left Space the rest of the  letters (Lam-Alif ligature,

    you say \"D @ its dotted twin.\" Earlier on, you recommended \"2. Kill the spaces
    after R @ Z ; 3. Shorten the initial F @ Q.\" and I was thinking for days \"killing
    the spaces after R and Z, I get it, but after \uFBAA?? I've shortened initial
    F and Q, but if I shorten \uFBAA more, it'll disappear! How do I do that?\" Hahahahah!
    You meant R & Z, F & Q, right? Thanks for your advise. XD this \"@\" confusion
    made me laugh a lot!"

    I think I'll enlarge the joints to avoid them to touch and increase the separation
    again because I feel they look so tight they'll start a neutron star! Or, am I

  body: Aristarco - if you squeeze the teeth of the seen sheen and enlarge the spacing
    of the other dotted  teeth you will get a more balanced font. Yes it looks quite
    nice as text bravo for designing for a language you do not read! Should I try
    an Aztec font?  That appendix at the end of the isolated seen is superfluous and
    is best removed?
