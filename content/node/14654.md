  a commercial artist. I believe that he knew the man.  The cloth cover is faded and
  worn but the pages are all quite pristine. I am interested in selling it and was
  advised to post here. Would anyone who might be interested please contact me at
  pesmen2001@yahoo.com\r\nI am in the US, if it matters. Very best,  Dale Pesmen"

  body: now that you've made a comment here, you might put it on Ebay. I think a lot
    of us here are book hounds on that site, and you might get top dollar if you auctioned
    it off...

    I think it would generate a lot of interest and potential revenue to support the
    site. Maybe it's too much work though.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
