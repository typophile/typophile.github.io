body: "We have finally managed to kick FontLab Studio 5 (at least the Windows version)
  out of the nest. Cool new stuff includes:\r\n\r\n   - <em><strong>Autotrace</strong></em>
  is now included in the product. No need to go outside Fontlab to trace glyphs.\r\n
  \  - Many new <em><strong>printing and proofing</strong></em> features, making it
  easy to get printouts at all stages of the font production process.\r\n   - <em><strong>RoboFab</strong></em>
  python library is now included in FontLab. Users get access to the Universal Font
  Object (.ufo) XML font format and to a bunch of improved python resources.\r\n   -
  New, improved <em><strong>metrics window</strong></em> incorporates a powerful new
  table that makes class-based kerning a snap and has a multi-line and context-based
  preview window so users can see how spacing and kerning will actually look in text
  without having to generate the whole font and print out samples.\r\n   - Support
  for <em><strong>Unicode 3.2 and 4.0</strong></em> means that users have access to
  virtually every character in Unicode.\r\n   \r\n    The new price is US$649 and
  upgrades from FL4.6 go for US$99. A Macintosh version is also in the works and will
  enter beta testing shortly.\r\n   \r\n   More details available at:\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FontLab-Studio-5-for-Windows/\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTed

    i didn't have a problem with them before.\r\nmy favourite bits are the preview,

  body: i have FOG, but never could get used to it. Perhaps it's because i downloaded
    the FLab demo first and learned my way around font software in it. I prefer letter
    drawing in FLab even to drawing in Illustrator. I'm addicted to FLS5 and dunno
    if i could ever go back to FLab 4. It's that good, IMO.

  body: "<em>Can you draw anykind of point and then change it (using the menu bar)?</em>\r\n\r\nYou
    mean change the kind of point you just made, or change the next kind of point
    you will make? If the latter, you can switch between different kinds of new points
    using either the toolbar of keyboard shortcuts. If you have already, for instance,
    made a corner point, and decide you want it to be a tangent you can covert the
    line on one side of it to a curve by alt+clicking on it, and then convert the
    point by double clicking on it. You don't need to change tools during this operation:
    the operations available are contextual based on where you click."

  body: 'If you''ve drawn a circle, you can only toggle between curve or corner point
    (by double-clicking on the node). You can''t have a tangent point unless there
    is a straight line on one side of the point and a curve on the other. The double-clicking
    is contextual: if you have a corner point with curves on either side, double-clicking
    on it will make it a curve point. If you have a corner point with a curve on one
    side and a straight line on the other side, double-clicking will make it a tangent.
    If you have a corner point with a straight line on both sides, double-clicking
    won''t do anything, since there is no curve element to define a curve or tangent.
    So point type is dependent on adjacent line type, which is how it should be I
    think.'
