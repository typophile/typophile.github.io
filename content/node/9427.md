  body: Thanks Daniel, <BR> <BR>I like the fact that <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-dearest/"
    target="_blank">Dearest</a> is &#34;inspired by handwritten characters found in
    a 19th century German book&#34; - this speaks to the Dutch influence I was looking
    for, and it helps that the font is inexpensive.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something
    about it, though, that is a bit too &#34;pretty.&#34; This is a book of letters
    between settlers to the Alberta prairies at the start of the 1900s, and something
    tells me they likely wouldn&#39;t have had such good penmanship.  <BR> <BR>That
    said, there is a nice roughness to this font, and &#34;poor penmanship&#34; isn&#39;t
    exactly a desireable characteristic of a display face. I know I&#39;m being picky,
    but I do appreciate your suggestion and I&#39;ll definitely keep it in mind. <BR>
    <BR>Hopefully others can supply a few additional options to consider. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again...

  body: I hate to admit it &#40;as it makes me out to be one of the kids&#41; but
    I like Dear Sarah a lot - and Open Type with small caps no less.  <BR> <BR>A couple
    of the new P22 fonts look good as well. <BR> <BR>Thanks so much for the input...
