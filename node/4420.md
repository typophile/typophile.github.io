body: Hi, folks. I&#39;ve heard wonders about your ability to identify fonts quick
  quick like a bunny and I finally have one I can&#39;t personally identify. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ve tried the services, but was unable to identify it. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.sitesunseen.com/clients/ekm/index.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.sitesunseen.com/clients/ekm/index.html</a> is the logo.
  I know the main one is Textile, and I recognize the small one that says &#34;Inspiring
  Lifelong Career Success&#34; but darned if I know what it is. <BR> <BR>Please help!
