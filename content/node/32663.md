  \u2013 I know this must be based on something like Civilit\xE9 because I've seen
  it on older book covers pre-dating digital, but I don't know what it was called
  or whether anyone has done a slightly more finished version than this one (I need
  accented characters, for example)."

  body: It looks like it was based on Legend (Bauer 1937). There are a lot of differences,
    but some letters match. It's almost like it was based on an incomplete specimen.

  body: thanks! I'll probably go with Canada Type's Ali-Baba instead, which isn't
    quite it, but has some of the same vibe.
