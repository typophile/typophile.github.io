  body: Interesting, how the author mentions Carson as the designer to replace the
    helvetica-corporate-look with a new approach, forgetting all about Neville Brody
    ten years earlier. Probably too young.

    the craft of graphic design as it does Helvetica. I am hoping it will see wider

    I suppose in journalism as well as fonts if you get offended by someone accusing
    you of plagiarism you're in the wrong business. \r\n\r\nAs for Arial, one of my
    adopted children, its interesting that when people make metrically compatible

    This is like Vince's (perhaps jocular) boasting that Comic Sans is the most popular
    typeface for anything \"fun\". We all know it's not because it's the best font
    for the job. It's just the one most widely available."

    me sick. I was on a convention not too long ago, and had to listen to some people
    from Microsoft boasting what a great design Arial was, and what an even greater
    design Segoe is.\r\n\r\nFace it, they're both clones, stolen from fonts made by
    somebody else. I simply hate it when people do that, and I hate it even more when
    big companies do that, because they know they'll get away with it.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I do think that Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica are quite different - Miedinger
    and Hoffmann did design a new typeface here, but they of course had references
    (don't we all?). But Arial is just copied. If you print it on thin paper and put
    the letters on top of each other, you can see that clearly. One of our profs at
    the university did this, and I was astonished to find that it was hard to find
    any differnces. 95% of the letters are simply the same! That is not true with
    Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica (or Neue Haas).\r\n\r\nI was very sorry to see
    Berthold go... they had some great typefaces!! But they just did not make it through
    to modern technology. It sometimes reminds me of Commodore :-)) It's always the
    companies I like, hihi..."

    coming to \"normal\" cinemas, this will be happening this fall in selected cities.
    Generally independent films do festivals and special event screenings first, then
    normal art house cinema runs. So the film will have a two-week run at the IFC
    Center in New York City in September, and there will be more runs like that announced
    in the next few months. The DVD release will happen immediately after those September
    cinema showings. \r\n\r\nBut overall the response from both design and non-design
    audiences so far has been fantastic.\r\n\r\nCheers from Minneapolis (we had two
