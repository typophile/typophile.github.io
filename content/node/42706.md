    NAMED BOREALIS\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the font in the festival magazine and on your
    posters called? I\u2019ve never seen it before\u201D. The question we\u2019ve
    had to answer several times the last weeks and the answer is rather simple: The
    font is called \u201CBorealis\u201D and is designed for the festival by the eminent
    designers in the local design collective Grandpeople. More about Grandpeople at

    <a href="http://www.unitdeltaplus.com/">Martin Kvamme</a> on this poster. He did
    the poster with Mike Patton and Stian Carstensen. '

    and poster in your image, as well as this years poster. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.studvest.no/kultur.php?art_id=8209\">Here's</a>
    the article I was referring to. I misunderstood. Martin Kvamme did a poster for
    Mike Patton (who is playing at Borealis)."
