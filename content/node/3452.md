body: I am posting samples from a few members of a font family I am building. The
  basic pattern or decision set is common to each memeber of the font but the overlay
  is different. The set of rules I gave myself were that the font should be monospaced,
  that it should fit a square grid &amp; the &#39;A&#39; would fit in 5 across by
  7 tall. The font has a full character set too which is partially presented here.
  Eventually I am thinking of making a non monospaced but still grid based version
  &amp; maybe expanding &amp; contracting the grid. At the rate I am going I amy end
  up with 500 fonts once I do weights &amp; so on. Before I go nuts with this I would
  like some feedback about my basic design choices. Because the font is made on a
  common bitmap format it has alot in common with other bitmapped fonts like The Process
  Type Foundry&#39;s &#39;find replace&#39;, thirst type&#39;s bitmaped offering &amp;
  even my clock radio&#39;s glowing blue LEDs. <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27927.gif"

  body: I should laso say that I had a hard time deciding whwere to post this - bitmapped/script,
    serif &#40; here&#41; or in display. I took the advice of another typophile &amp;
    put it here. It does seem to me that a monospaced area might be the best place
    for it since the issues this font deals with have fairly little to do with serif
    type as we typically think about it.

  body: 'To me this project has one distinct merit: to have different fonts be highly
    interchangable. Individually the fonts &#40;especially the first one&#41; are
    nothing highly interesting in my opinion, but the fact that one font can be used
    to highlight/differentiate words in a body of another &#40;with affecting flow&#41;
    is appealing, and useful in some contexts. <BR> <BR>Making them monospaced is
    not a requirement in this regard, on the other hand being monospaced allows you
    to swap in any <i>letters</i> without affecting flow, and that can be interesting
    in animation for example. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
