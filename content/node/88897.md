  body: "Use the keyword \u201Csquare\u201D when searching sites such as MyFonts.\r\nI
    use that description in the metadata whenever I upload a squarish face to distributors.\r\nHowever,
    I have yet to tag a face as \u201Cgreat\u201D or \u201Crespectable\u201D, although
    the user feedback in \u201Cliking\u201D (number of stars etc.) may provide some
    indication."
