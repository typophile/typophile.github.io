  pick between regular(roman) and italic, in illustrator you get a drop down menu
  with the options 'diamond' 'gold' and 'platnum.'\r\n\r\nI have read the FL manual
  and figured out how to actually do this, but I know that doing anything unconventional
  in the computer world often ends up creating usability problems in some way.  For
  example, perhaps doing this would make the fonts invisible to certain programs,
  because they don't understand the format.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has fooled around with
  this, I would love some pointers on how to make sure the fonts always work properly."

    Twardoch's overview of font naming in FontLab]] and carefully map each field to
    test your results you should be able to get something working consistently.\r\n\r\nHowever,

    would probably find using TTX to check naming fields and update that information
    a useful way of quickly updating the fonts as you test them. For more complex
    family groups I use Excel to keep track of the different fields."

  body: "I have had a chance to experiment with this now and as you will see from
    the screen grab, it can work as long as you manipulate the right metadata fields.
    By way of example, below is the metadata for the <em>Gomez Lurch</em> weight/style:\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Addams
    Family (Gomez Lurch)</em></strong>\r\n<dl><strong>Names and Copyright</strong>\r\nFamily
    Name: Addams Family\r\nWeight: Gomez\r\nWidth: Normal\r\nNumber: 600\r\n[<em>Font
    is italic</em> ticked]\r\nStyle Name: Italic\r\nPS Font Name: AddamsFamily-GomezLurch\r\nFull
    Name: AddamsFamily-GomezLurch\r\nMenu Name: Addams Family\r\nFOND Name: AddamsFamily
    GomezLurch\r\n\r\n<strong>OpenType-specific names</strong>\r\nOT Family Name:
    Addams Family\r\nOT Style Name: Gomez Lurch\r\nMac Name: AddamsFamily-GomezLurch</dl>\r\n\r\nThis
    was done with FontLab (no TTX work needed) and the the shot is from InDesign CS6.
    It also worked in Word 2011 but not as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AddamsFamily_4396.jpg]"
