  anyone can give me some advice, that would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.  '

    is the most commonly used professional tool now, and is probably the best bet.
    If you are looking for a cheaper alternative, and don&#39;t need all the features
    of FontLab, you might find their TypeTool to be appropriate.

  body: I have spent only the last couple of weeks using FontLab, and I am quite addicted.
    It is a very intuitive program, and very user friendly. The bezier operations  <BR>are
    so smooth and natural to use. I know it has a truck  <BR>load more features to
    it, but I will get around to them. In  <BR>short, it is probably the most kick
    a$$ program I have  <BR>ever used. I am very much a beginner, with no  <BR>experience
    of Fontlab or Fontmaster. &#40;Man cannot live  <BR>on fontlab alone...&#41; <BR>
    <BR>And DTL have a free download  version of their  <BR>software, so you could
    give them a blast and see what <BR> you think.

    given by the type design community in the development of FontLab, I think you
    can say that FontLab is designed by type designers as well <BR> '

  body: I&#39;d just add that DTL FontMaster is really designed for a full-on production
    environment, for use by people who are designing fonts full time. Even more so
    than FontLab. <BR> <BR>T
