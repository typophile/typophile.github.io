  For his part, Walken remains the only working actor capable of ranting about a font
  change and making that both dramatic and funny. It's a rare movie that couldn't
  use more Walken. \r\n\r\nhttp://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-0501014-movies-review-domino,0,2605597.story?coll=mmx-movies_top_heds\r\n\r\n>
  And Christopher Walken stays weird as a hyperactive reality TV producer, whose biggest
  concern is the font on the ad campaign for \"The Bounty Squad.\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  who's seen it comment on the scene in question?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    as well. The guy clears the screens dedicated to alien DNA and then asks someone
    what font he should use for an invitational card or something like that.\r\n\r\nThough,
    when I saw the subject header, I was hoping this would be about the metal typeface
    of the same name!!!\r\n\r\nGerald"

    great. I highly recommend it, and it doesn't hurt if like Keira Knightley.\r\n\r\nChristopher
    Walken doesn't mention any specific fonts, he mentions that they're having font
    problems (I think) and then a little bit later on he's on the phone tells them
    to change the font or something like that.  Sorry I don't have direct quotes or
    anything... my memory's terrible for stuff like this.\r\n\r\nTony Scott uses lots
    of on-screen typography in the movie for characters' names, etc. The movie had
    a similar feel to <em>Man on Fire</em>; another enjoyable movie."

  body: "Wandered out and saw Domino this afternoon. No specific fonts mentioned,
    just Walken looking shocked as he sees a mock-up graphic for the reality show
    \"The Bounty Squad\" and he starts freaking out, repeatedly, to the point where
    he interrupts a meeting with the bounty hunters themselves to take a call so that
    he can ream out the designer of the mock-ups: \"Why did you change the fucking
    font? WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE FUCKING FONT??!!!\" This while the bounty gang sit
    pondering whether or not to sign up for the show. What's interesting is that whether
    or not the Walken character actually cares about the font change (maybe he's just
    putting on a show for the hunters), the use of a given font to \"represent\" them
    is portrayed with some sense of import. If nothing else, it was nice to hear the
    word font in a movie theatre.\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, is that the opening
    & closing credits, and the sporadic textual markers throughout the movie, are
    typographically horrible."
