  selection of fonts.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm in the business of web design, and I use
  the font \"Palatino Linotype\" alot, just love the serif feel to it and that it's
  a system font so it's compatible with everyone that happens to come across my site.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I think that I overuse it too much, and need some alternatives. Have anything in
  mind, EXCEPT \"Times New Roman\". Thanks!"

  body: "Palatino isn\u2019t web safe, and neither are these suggestions. \r\n\r\nBelow
    are some CSS font stacks that you might want to consider. I don\u2019t have time
    to go into all the specifics, but they should all give a relatively similar look
    in most cases. I have screenshots of the Cleartype rendering, but I\u2019m not
    sure how well they work with Greyscale/B&W rendering. About [[http://www.typophile.com/node/70933|31%]]
    (although the number is declining rapidly) sees Greyscale/B&W rendering. \r\n\r\nI
    assume you\u2019re designing on a Windows computer as you mentioned Palatino,
    so you could easily check the rendering yourself by changing the font smoothing
    settings.\r\n\r\nWeb safe font stack suggestions:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>font-family:
    Perpetua, Baskerville, \"Times New Roman\", \"Nimbus Roman No9 L\", serif;</li>
    \r\n<li>font-family: \"Bookman Old Style\", \"URW Bookman L\", Georgia, serif;</li>\r\n<li>font-family:
    Baskerville, \"Baskerville Old Face\", \"Times New Roman\", \"Nimbus Roman No9
    L\", serif; <em>(only regular weight and no italics)</em></li>\r\n<li>font-family:
    Garamond, \"Hoefler Text\", serif; <em>(different x-height at same sizes)</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nYour
    other option is to make use of the @font-face tag and rent or buy a font from
    [[http://typekit.com/|Typekit]] (varying quality and rendering), [[http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=80|Fontfont]]
    (not cross browser yet, unless you also rent from Typekit) or someone else \u2013
    a web search would give you more options. [[http://code.google.com/intl/no/apis/webfonts/|Google]]
    also offers the Android fonts for free, and they are hinted for screen use.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, your safest bet if you stick with Palatino is to code your CSS like this:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>font-family:
    \"Palatino Linotype\", \"Book Antiqua\", \"URW Palladio L\", serif;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPalatino
    Linotype is covered with Windows and all MS Office versions. URW Palladio L is
    bundled with Ghostscript and has a 91% Linux coverage and Book Antiqua is bundled
    with MS Office 04 on OSX. Mac users might not have MS Office, so you\u2019re not
    covered all the way. What Palatino Linotype does offer is decent rendering, as
    it has been hinted extensively.\r\n"
