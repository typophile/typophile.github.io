body: I need a FREE font, that is VERY SIMILAR to the font used in iOS Headers. As
  far as I know, this is Helvetica Neue, but I can't use the free webfont version
  as I need to be able to distribute it... this is for a free page heme for tumblr,
  so no profit is made from this.

    on URW Nimbus Sans L, a freely-licensed version of Helvetica released under the
    GPL. These fonts, however, are based on the original version of Helvetica rather
    than Helvetica Neue, and only come in regular, italic, bold and bold italic."

  body: "the original version of Helvetica\r\n\r\nPleae note that the L in URW Nimbus
    Sans L stands for Laserwriter. It was me who introduced the L in the URW font
    names to distinguish the URW LaserWriter clone fonts from other versions of fonts
    with the same name. So URW Nimbus Sans L is not \u2018the original version of
    Helvetica\u2019 it is a clone of Helvetica which tries to match the PostScript
    version made by Adobe by the time first Apple LaserWriters were enabled to handle
    downloadable or pre-installed scalable PostScript Type1 outline fonts. Adobe has
    been improving these fonts several times and URW has tried to track them throughout
    the years.\r\n\r\nOn its turn, the Adobe version of Helvetica has not much to
    do with the original versions of Helvetica made by Haas, Stempel or Linotype.
    The italics of the Adobe version started their life as electronically slanted
    versions of the roman and not much fundamental has changed ever since."

  body: "Helvetica \"Oblique\" was a shortcut to save the poor LaserWriter's precious
    memory. Examining how that worked introduced me to the inner workings of Font
    Matrixes, though, so it wasn't all for nothing.\r\n\r\nRemind me again: was Helvetica
    Narrow also a fake font? Searching for that data, a bit of a surprise popped up:
    This (self-declared \"old\") page: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA40127?viewlocale=en_US
    states\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The LaserWriter does not use true fonts for Bold, Italic,
    and so on. Instead it does some algorithmic calculation to create the these fonts
    from the plain typeface.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSurely that's a bit of an exaggeration?"

  body: Hi, thanks for all your inputs. You've all been mentioning "Laserwriter",
    will these type of fonts still work for a website theme? (or just for the web?)
    thanks

    it was just a horizontally scaled version. Condensed italic was scaled and slanted\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The

    that's a bit of an exaggeration?</blockquote>\r\nNo. The notes on the LaserWriter
    describe what the first generation did under Apple\u2019s QuickDraw using bitmapped
    fonts. The later LaserWriter Plus version, had 13 scalable Adobe PS Type1 outline
    fonts on board: 4 Helvetica, 4 Times, 4 Courier and 1 Symbol. The next generation,
    LaserWriter II NT and NTX, had the aforementioned 35 Adobe PS Type1 outline fonts
    on board and other PS Type1 fonts would be downloaded to the printer. The 35 Adobe
    PS Type1 fonts had true bold weights for all the fonts, slanted italics for the
    sans serif fonts (Helvetica, Helvetica Condensed (squooshed from Helvetica) and
    ITC Avant Garde) and Courier. They had true bolds and italics for the serif fonts
    (Times, Palatino, ITC Bookman, New Century Schoolbook) and a true italic for ITC
    Zapf Chancery, plus Symbol and Dingbats makes 35. The slanted and squooshed fonts
    made it possible to put as much fonts as possible on the memory chips of those
    days.\r\nIn those days they were known as the \u2018LaserWriter 35\u2019. Everyone
    in the type industry was busy cloning them im some way or another.\r\nConsidering
    the first LaserWriter being a non-PostScript device, my description and the \u2018L\u2019
    are a bit confusing. The URW \u2018L\u2019 fonts do not emulate the Apple LaserWriter
    fonts, they emulate the Adobe/Linotype PS Type1 outline fonts that were made to
    run as from the Apple LaserWriter Plus\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the present versions
    of the URW \u2018L\u2019 fonts perform very well on websites, but from an aesthetic
    point of view one must consider that especially the proportions and metrics of
    Helvetica still suffer from memory restrictions of the Apple LaserWriters."
