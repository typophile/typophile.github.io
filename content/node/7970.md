  body: Ken, justifing that much text copy is hard to read. Make it Flush Left, Rag
    Right. Also &#40;if you can&#41; allow for some hypenation for better color. The
    banking industry here doesn&#39;t allow hypenation. You might also look into making
    a two column layout. Remember most people read newspapers and magazines and they
    generally don&#39;t have wide columns. Just because the logo is in a sans serif
    face it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have a serif face for the body copy. I
    would think the separation would help the communication. Think again about newspapers
    and magazines. <BR> <BR>One last thought the 97% ad is unreadable with the body
    text like that. Its also inconsistant with your other image ads. How about getting
    a picture of a rig and in photoshop put the 97% on the trailer of the rig. Reinforce
    that its about ground transportation.

    fashioned?  Or maybe since the audience might just be a little old-school when
    it comes to technology, maybe something the opposite then? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure what you mean when you say &#34;allow for some hypenation for better color&#34;.  Do
    you mean to add more hyphens and make them one of the logotype colours? <BR> <BR>I
    like your other suggestions and will implement them surely.  Thanks again Dan
    for your input.

  body: Okay, I made all the changes that I understood and just uploaded 3 versions
    of them.  The first I columnized the layout and then went with a serif font just
    to see how it would look.  The second is a column that just uses dax-light again
    and the Vito advertisement is flush left, rag right like you suggested.  I columized
    the first two because their copy was larger than the other &#34;person envy&#34;
    ads. <BR> <BR>Of the two column layouts, which do you think is better?  I like
    the Dax one better still.   <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m going to fix up that 97% ad.

  body: Now Ken I have one more bone to pick with your ads. Way too much copy. You
    need to tease the reader into action. In this case either calling the toll-free
    number or going to the web site. At the web site or the telephone operators can
    give the full story. Also I&#39;m confussed do you only handle ground traffic
    or air traffic as well? If you handle air traffic you somehow have to make that
    clear too.  <BR> <BR>I like the two column format but not the justification. To
    justify copy it creates wholes throughout the paragraphs as letter spacing and
    word spacing is compromised to make it flush. Thats why the color of Flush left,
    rag right copy reads better. I don&#39;t think it matters if the serif has any
    relationship with Dax, the body text is not the logo and should probably be kept
    separate from it. Keep up the good work

  body: Ken, <BR>This is some good work. As a first comment I would make sure that
    you do not use double word spaces after a full point &#40;or in any other place&#41;
    this will improve the colour of your type, for certain combinations . W and .
    T it is worth kerning the space to help. As pointed out justified type can be
    a bit of a trial, for example, in your first &#40;and to a lesser extent in the
    second&#41; the second line of the righthand column is a bit spacy, if you are
    in a position to rewrite/have rewritten to suit that might help, or there is no
    reason that the two columns couldn&#39;t be different widths. To aid readers and
    potential clients I would try to get all three elements of the date in the same
    line. In the second layout the leading in the righthand column is not the same
    as that of the left not being the same results in an ugly step. To get picky,
    if you have a full point or comma at the end of a line in justified text it can
    make a step in the righthand vertical margin, an easy way to deal with this is
    to insert a white &#40;or the same colour as the background&#41; full point/comma
    at the end of each line to create hanging punctuation &#40;remember that you have
    done this when it comes to changing/updating a piece of text&#41;. I might consider
    moving the logo so that the t of Connect aligned with the righthand margin of
    the body copy. <BR>Tim

  body: Thanks for all the comments everyone.  Here are the next versions of the ads
    that incorporate everyone&#39;s comments. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t move the logo
    so that the &#39;t&#39; lined up with the right side of the second column because
    then it makes a big uneven space on the right side of the ad.  Either I move the
    paragraph over so it&#39;s not centered you the tagline is too far to the right
    :/  I noticed this before when I was positioning things earlier before the comment
    but wanted to try it again.  I don&#39;t see how it could work.  I do realize
    now after looking at it that something is still odd about it but I printed one
    of the ads and it looks better when its aligned with the tagline. <BR> <BR>I just
    picked the proforma serif font.  I used the light version and the semi-bold for
    the website, phone, etc.  Your right Dan, once printed I can read the text much
    better.  It also gave it this rich kind of feel that I wouldn&#39;t have expected
    and got this warm feeling that it started to actually look like an advertisement.
    <BR> <BR>I made sure the punctuation is hanging.  This was a great comment and
    I would have never saw this on my own.  It&#39;s a good thing my program has an
    option for it actually so I didn&#39;t have to add in those extra white periods
    at the end of each line. <BR> <BR>Also Tim, I removed the double spaces.  It looks
    weird on the screen actually, but the space is very adequate once it&#39;s printed.  I&#39;ll
    make sure to not double space after sentences anymore.  That&#39;s a good tip.
    <BR> <BR>I never even realized the problem with the leading on the first ad.  Again,
    this is just stuff I&#39;d never notice unless I was taught.  Thanks so much for
    that because after looking at it, it&#39;s kind of embarassing.  Told you I was
    not a designer <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m actually marveled at how you guys can see a problems
    with the line &#34;employee, but also because her company uses&#34; because again,
    that just didn&#39;t jump out at me.  I&#39;ll have to internalize a lot of these
    techniques for future works.  Very useful.  The problem is still there, but I&#39;ll
    remove it once I reword the text so that &#34;BorderConnect&#34; is on the same
    line. <BR> <BR>The one thing I didn&#39;t do was flush left the columns as Dan
    had suggested, mainly because the right column looked weird with &#34;BorderConnect&#34;
    on the next line.  I think the rest of sentences actually look fine besides that
    though.  I think I just have to reword it to make justification or the flush left
    to work correctly. <BR> <BR>Lastly, and probably most importantly, I shrunk all
    the copy by a few lines.  You&#39;d notice that more if you compared these new
    versions as single-column layouts like the original ads.  I think the columnization
    and the extra leading makes it even appear as less text too.  I also started to
    use the active voice a bit more, as one copywriter website had suggested. <BR>
    <BR>I think the problem with the service that we are providing is that a lot of
    carriers don&#39;t really know what it is, so it&#39;s imperative to give them
    some use-cases to visualize what the software can do in their minds.  At least,
    that&#39;s what we try to do on the phone when selling to potential customers
    and the hit rates are higher.   <BR> <BR>We also don&#39;t have any competitors
    really, so we can&#39;t say our solution is &#34;faster&#34;, &#34;safer&#34;,
    &#34;cheaper&#34;, etc. like other brands can.  We also don&#39;t have a point
    of reference like normal products do &#40;like cars, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    here are the new versions and let me know what you think.  Thanks again for all
    the amazing comments.   You guys astonish me all the time. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55095.jpg"

  body: Oh, the reason why the letters are capitalize was due to the web.  It&#39;s
    just not readable at high resolutions with small caps when the logo is only 50
    pixels high.  I basically did like 100 different versions of the tagline actually
    with all kinds of cases, positions, weights, etc.  I&#39;d rather use the same
    tagline for consistency than have a different one for print and web, or is that
    the wrong thinking? <BR> <BR>Actually, the more I look at it, the more the headlines
    look weird to me.  I started trying to use some different sizes, letter-spacing
    and weights, but I can&#39;t really make it look right.  Hrmm..  any suggestions
    on fixing that?

  body: Ken, Change your Headlines and subheads to a display face. Leave Dax for the
    logo only. Don&#39;t worry about making the ads matching the website. No one will
    take the ad and compare it to the website. Its two different kinds of media. Just
    make sure the message is the same. Have you considered changing the photos to
    a duotone or tritone. Right now they look like stock photos.

    the first word of a sentence, especially if the word is a 2 or 3 letter word.
    On the second two column version the hanging punctuation looks good, however I
    would avoid having the paragraphs set on forced justification, the last line of
    the first paragraph in the righthand column and the sixth line of the lefthand
    column look particularly spacy. I should have made it clear that I was talking
    about punctuation that occured at the end of the line except the last line. <BR>Tim

  body: Thanks again for all the great feedback Dan and Tim.  I think I get the general
    principles associated with justification.  I&#39;m finding it fairly easy to fake
    justification with the flush left, ragged right by changing words around and adding
    hyphens.  However, if I can fake it, making it justified actually looks pretty
    good too, so I guess you can use flush left, ragged right as a guide to perfecting
    it the spacing problems and then justify it afterwards.  I think the justified
    look is superior visually, but I also see the problems with letter and word spacing,
    so I want to have the best of both worlds. <BR> <BR>I went back to my old fast
    company magazines and it seems that 65% of the ads justify their text &#40;single
    or two-colomn layouts&#41; and 35% don&#39;t.  I noticed that certain advertisements
    like car ads &#40;most&#41;, Microsoft, HP, etc. will not justify any of their
    text while others will.  In most cases where I saw justified text, they fixed
    the problems with word spacing, however some companies did not.  Interesting enough,
    the large companies with a lot of advertising dollars did it right and the no-name
    brands did it wrong.  After thinking about everything you guys have been teaching
    me, it has become glaringly obvious now. <BR> <BR>I have incorporated all the
    suggestions up to this point, so here is an update.  I tried looking at display
    fonts, but everything I try on my computer looks bad.  I realized that italizing
    really makes things look better though, although I don&#39;t really know why &#40;don&#39;t
    understand the psychology&#41;.  What are some good display faces that you&#39;d
    recommend Daniel? <BR> <BR>Also, is it really that obvious that pictures look
    like stock photos?  Is that a bad thing?  I have taken some real digital photos
    of our customers actually &#40;in the office, on the road, in the lots, at the
    border, etc.&#41; and I could use those.   <BR> <BR>So duotone, tritone and quadtone
    images are the way to go?  I have not read any articles even mentioning the benefits
    and disadvantages to doing this, so I don&#39;t really know much about it.  In
    fact, it never even occured to me.  I have seen some ads in black/white, like
    those from salesforce.com or omnisky, HP, IBM &#40;and many others&#41;, as well
    as some quadtone pictures from Doilette and Touche.  I also see full-color images
    too, like every ad from Microsoft, although I guess that&#39;s understandable
    with their XP, Office and MSN campaigns, where all of their brands have multiple
    bright colours of red, yellow, blue and green.  I&#39;m not really sure what the
    strategy or general principles are here. <BR> <BR>Anyway, here are some updates.  I&#39;m
    still not liking the display fonts as mentioned earlier.  I tried to use the same
    font for the subheads as the headlines, but it just doesn&#39;t look right to
    me. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55155.jpg"

  body: Ken the point about the stock photos is you ad will get lost in publications
    that use stock photos. In your first Aynsley ad loose the &#34;walk 30 minutes
    through snow&#34; even if it was true it sounds like a scare tactic. Only stress
    benefits not consenquences. The reason for using display faces is to sort of shock
    the eye not nessicerely please the eye. They ad a uniqueness to your look. I suggest
    looking at one of the Indie Font books for inspiration, check a library or contact
    P22 fonts. There are two volumns. Ken you haven&#39;t told me if your software
    is for drivers only or does it also work with air traffic? If it works with air
    traffic also make it clear it does at least in one ad. If it only ground traffic
    make that painfully  clear.

  body: The software is just for ground.  To be honest, I don&#39;t even know how
    customs does air traffic, but I&#39;m assuming they release the shipment when
    the plane takes off or lands, or both.  Either way, that really doesn&#39;t have
    much to do with the actual release offices. <BR> <BR>Customs hasn&#39;t exactly
    told us what the messages are capable of either but we have many ground carriers
    using the system and we built the software with the intention of providing a service
    for ground carriers only.  I&#39;d actually have to ask customs and sign up an
    air carrier to see what kind of messages the government is sending us to verify
    if it can work with air traffic.  That might sound kind of weird, but the specifications
    for connecting software with customs is extremely poor and are filled with all
    kinds of mistakes and missing inforamtion &#40;both technical and even high-level
    information&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m not really sure why this can be confusing
    because when I think of the border, I think of the ports of entry into Canada/US.  When
    I think of border problems, I think of excessively long lineups miles long and
    drivers being sent away to customs compounds in frustration when the shipments
    aren&#39;t properly cleared by the customs broker.  Those are the problems are
    software solves. <BR> <BR>I can make it abundantly clear that its international
    ground carriers I guess and start showing more trucks &#40;as you suggested&#41;.  I
    have some pictures of directions and vps next their trucks actually smiling into
    the camera.  I also have some drivers in various pictures in and out of their
    trucks.  I can use those but they aren&#39;t really professional pictures although
    Photoshop might be able to fix that problem. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll take out the &#34;30
    minutes in the snow&#34; part then.  The fact is true though.  In Winnipeg, Manitoba
    it snows more often than when I live and it can get fairly deep.  A lot of times
    when the truck is forced to stop at the border, the driver has to walk to a customs
    broker at a compound.  If that&#39;s in the snow, it usually makes a lot of drivers
    really pissed off if you can imagine.  That&#39;s more of a location-specific
    problem because here in Windsor, Ontario, we don&#39;t have that problem really.  That&#39;s
    actually why certain ads need to target certain locations.  In Windsor, it&#39;s
    the long lineups and so on as it&#39;s the busiest border-crossing in the entire
    world believe it or not. <BR> <BR>So would you suggest of taking some custom photos
    and keep them in full-color?  Or is the general principle to always use duotone
    to make them standout from the other ads?  When you say, &#34;get lost in publications
    that use stock photos&#34;, I guess I&#39;m not really sure what the means.  A
    lot of ads use stock photos and are full color, so I never noticed a problem with
    it &#40;but I obviously am not an expert and I don&#39;t know the benefits and
    disadvantages to each approach&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking at p22 right now.  I&#39;m
    not terribly impressed with them but I&#39;ll look through them all.  Hopefully
    I find something that catches my eye. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your comments
    Dan, as always.

- body: Ken, it&#39;s cool that you are looking through other ads and comparing justification
    and making observations. That attention to detail will really help you out if
    this is something you continue to do. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t mind me jumping
    in late, I can add some suggestions to Tim &amp; Daniel&#39;s already very helpful
    ones.   <BR> <BR>With Vito &amp; Jack, the line length is much too long. 113 characters
    is almost twice the &#34;maximum&#34; for optimal readability. The two-column
    layouts are much more pleasing and won&#39;t overwhelm your readers. People &#40;who
    read correctly&#41; read by grouping up phrases from line to line, but this is
    impossible with long line lengths. Try aiming for around 45-66 characters, includings
    spaces. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s really nice that you haven&#39;t added space
    between lines AND indented new paragraphs. Usually people do that all the time,
    and it&#39;s unnecessary. Congrats! &#40;and thank you.&#41; <BR> <BR>Proforma
    has a set of small caps, and since you are using all caps with FREE and AMPS,
    it would be extra nice to set these in small caps. <BR> <BR>For Jack, should the
    headline end with a period? <BR> <BR>For Aynsley1 &#40;the first one&#41;, you
    might also want to hang the punctuation in the photo descriptions after the names.
    Since the captions are shorter, some people might purposefully leave them the
    way you have them. Your line count &#40;or depth&#41; shouldn&#39;t vary by just
    one or two. When you are lining things up, you either want to have them align
    perfectly, or create enough of a difference that it makes a healthy contrast.
    <BR> <BR>For the two column layouts, it looks like you have matched the space
    between columns with the space between paragraphs. You might want to consider
    bringing the columns a little bit closer. This will make them feel more unified
    as a section of copy. Now, there&#39;s also something called rivers. This is where
    white space runs up through a paragraph. Subconsciously they can be distracting,
    and they kill the color for paragraphs. It can happen when the same word falls
    in the same position on two consecutive lines &#40;the first aynsley ad, second
    column, the word &#34;her&#34;&#41; or it can occur randomly just because. If
    you spot them, you can try to reword sentences. It happens more in justified settings
    because sentences stretch out to fit, creating more space, and it might be another
    reason Daniel is suggesting left-aligned ragged right. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s possible,
    the dates would look better if you can keep from breaking them up. Might not be
    possible, but if you are able to rewrite things, it would flow much better. Tim
    mentioned this previously. <BR> <BR>Stock photography is really tricky. In the
    future, look for pictures with eye contact and not a lot of background clutter.
    The two photos with eye contact are so much more dynamic, and even makes it seem
    like these people are actually telling you their story. In the second Aynsley
    photo, the cluttered desk makes her look disorganized and the red cup draws too
    much attention. In a directed photo, you would have been able to remove it and
    put meaningful objects in the background. <BR> <BR>This is just something I noticed,
    and I&#39;m not trying to say anything, but it&#39;s all white people. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> It seems like the border might be a little more controlled
    than you think! Just teasing. Some diversity might help though. <BR> <BR>Lastly,
    in the tagline, do you need the word &#34;Because?&#34; Might want to just have
    &#34;Borders were made for crossing.&#34; <BR> <BR>Hope you found these comments
    useful! Your revisions so far are looking good.

  body: 'Thanks for the comments Brian. You mentioend several good points that I&#39;m
    going to implement.  I&#39;ve actually been reading Ogilvy On Advertising and
    Robert Bly&#39;s Copywriting handbook, which repeatedly hammers on some of the
    points that you have mentioned. <BR> <BR>I have actually read some material that
    conflicts to what is being said here too by Dan and Tim, and that is what is on
    my mind right now.  Namely: <BR> <BR>1. There seems to be a principal to use shorter
    copy, however Ogivly is pro-long copy and Bly offers some good principles that
    let you choose, which also lead to long copy for my service. <BR> <BR>2. Duotone
    or other effects on photos.  Ogivly hasn&#39;t shown one advertisement where he
    edits the photo.  They are all full-color photos with bleeding that are positioned
    in three or four spots every time.  I think they look nice and it was the effect
    I was going for even before I knew about Ogilvy.  He belives that the more you
    make them look like an article from the magazine, the more people are inclined
    to read it.  It&#39;s also more readable from his research. <BR> <BR>Bly says
    these that by tinting the photo, doing fancy arrows or &#34;addy&#34; kind of
    design elements, you lose readership.  This is just a different way of saying
    what Ogivly is saying. <BR> <BR>Both went into way more detail, but that&#39;s
    the jist of what they are saying. <BR> <BR>3. I&#39;ve made some strides in making
    some different ads.  Most of them are a bit more creative, are &#34;risky&#34;
    if Ogivly or Bly were to look at them and have shorter copies.  However, everything
    I&#39;m reading is suggesting that it&#39;s a mistake.  In fact, I should really
    go back and rework a lot of copy or delete some of the ads altogether &#40;Like
    Vito for example, which seems to be very flat and doesn&#39;t do a very good job
    of selling or promising anything specific&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think I still have
    a week or two of working on these ads before I get it right.  I hope to launch
    them at the beginning of January, so I still have a lot of time. <BR> <BR>When
    I get some more time, I&#39;ll be sure to reply more specifically to your comments
    Brian.  There is some great stuff in there &#40;like the period on the headline
    - my bad, utilizing the small caps &#40;a typography article was saying the same
    thing for office documents, keeping the date on the same line, etc.&#41;  I really
    appreciate it.'

  body: Ken first of all January isn&#39;t far away. You have to make the comps into
    mechanicals with bleed, trim and safety. If you aren&#39;t up on these contact
    someone who regularly does production for magazine ads. Also you will have to
    add a slug also something to bring up with a production person.  <BR> <BR>That
    Ogivly book is old! I suggest you read ad information thats been published fresh
    in the last couple of years. Trends change. <BR> <BR>Check out CreativePro.com
    they have a lot of useful articles and recently there was one about using different
    treatments on photos.  <BR> <BR>As ususal Ken keep up the good work

  body: Ken, <BR>Unfortunately &#40;or fortunately if you make a crust by doing it&#41;
    design/advertising doesn&#39;t have hard and fast rules &#40;except that if offered
    a choice the client will always choose the one you did in a rush to provide a
    choice&#41;. Which is why you get advice and not instructions here. <BR>Ogilvy
    &amp; Mather certainly did edit/retouch images. <BR>Tim
