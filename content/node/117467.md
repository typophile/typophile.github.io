body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shepheards_label1_4595.jpg]\r\nI'd like
  to use this label as the basis for a poster design for a production of Agatha Christie's
  Murder on the Nile. Haven't got anything on my machine, had a look through Indentifont
  and WTF with no joy, so found this site recommended on a blog here http://www.webhostingreviewboards.com/design/5-famous-font-recognition-tools-and-my-personal-experience/
  and thought I'd ask, very nicely, if anyone could help. Design is for a penurious
  amateur drama company, so free would be nice, but not essential...\r\nThanks in
  advance\r\nMike"

  body: Thanks, all. It's a piece of hand lettering, I guess - going by the variations
    in the E and S, if nothing else - but I'll give the suggestions a go. In essence,
    looking for something in and Art Deco stylie that doesn't make people yawn...
