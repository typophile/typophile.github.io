  body: Gee, I was hoping someone knew this one. I thought it might be from T-26,
    but I couldn&#39;t find it there. <BR> <BR>It has some interesting traits. <BR>
    <BR>Any other ideas? I wanted to bump this back up into the current list.

  body: Wow, Mike. That sounds time consuming. <BR>This is halfway to serif, tho.
    I&#39;m not sure it falls into either category. <BR> <BR>Adriano, have you tried
    contacting the web designer? <BR> <BR>mail@ssl.co.pt
