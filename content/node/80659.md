  am developing a brand that is focused on the purity of a product, and the approach
  is to use a stripped-back typeface as a core word mark.\r\n\r\nTo support the stripped
  back sans I was hoping to use Austin as it's emotive qualities will work well to
  create dynamic packaging and create a visual language for the brand.\r\n\r\nI love
  the depth of the Foundry Grotesk family. I also have a picture in my mind of the
  word mark being similar to Trade gothic Bold Cond No.20 (all CAPS).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    Champion.
