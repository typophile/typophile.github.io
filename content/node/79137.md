body: "These (very nice) English subtitles are from the 1991 French film \"<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/\">Delicatessen</a>\".
  I imagine that Miramax is responsible for them since they are the US distributor
  of the film. It was released in the US in 1993 but this version (from Netflix) could
  be from a DVD released later. \r\n\r\nMy first guesses were TheSans, FF Strada,
  FF Kievit, FF Profile, even FF BeoSans. But none of these fit. \r\n\r\nBeyond identifying
  the font, does anyone know how I can find the team responsible for these? Subtitling
  often doesn't get credits in the film or on IMDB. Emails to Miramax have gone unanswered.
  I'd like to write a piece for <a href=\"http://fontsinuse\">Fonts In Use</a>, but
  I imagine my request pales in comparison to the big time press inquiries they get
  daily.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli1_6244.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli2_4790.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli3_4645.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli5_4339.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli4_3940.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli6_3796.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/deli7_5866.jpg]"

  body: "There are some standard caption fonts for TV from Philips, and we have also
    just designed a few of them, but this is a regular typeface, not a special one
    for that purpose. I know that I know it, but I\u2019m having one of those senior
    moments where I cannot quite place it. Not one of Georg Seifert\u2019s, which
    is what I thought at first. But one of those where one or two weights are available
    for free."

  body: According to Amazon, there are at least 2 DVD (2006, 2008) and 1 Blu-ray (2010)
    editions of "Delicatessen," and they are all from <a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/">Lionsgate</a>
    Home Entertainment. Perhaps they commissioned the subtitles? (Don't know for sure,
    of course.)

    take off. And named for the best Mexican Taqueria in the SF Bay area. Huevos to

  body: "Thanks all! It looks like they trimmed your 'l', Steve. \r\n\r\nDo you know
    who makes the decision on subtitle font? The distributor? Or are captions and
    subtitles simply data and the player has the fonts built in?"

  body: The answer about decision making is 'all of the above'... we have worked with
    distributors to license type for subtitles. But some players include fonts to
    render the captioning. The mysterious 'l' is either due to the fact we have offered
    one with and one without a 'foot'; or someone did, in fact, lop off the foot in
    the bmp file used to render this.

  body: "Yes, this study is now 5 years old. If anyone wants to commission us to create
    a new report, please let me know. :)\r\n\r\nStephen, as to your question on who
    makes the decision on the subtitle font, the answer is not an easy one because
    there are so many people/companies involved in the process. So it could be \"all
    of the above\" multiple guess answer... We've licensed fonts to a variety of different
    companies involved in the process. \r\n\r\nI think the good news in all of this
    is that the state of the art continues to advance, and we are seeing better quality
    typography on the big screen, in addition to the small screens!"

  body: "Subtitles are all rendered by our authoring house via whichever software
    suite they are using for a particular media. In my experience it is rare on distributor
    or studio side for someone to pay attention to details like this. I would suspect
    it is the individual author(s), and perhaps even a design commitment of the whole
    authoring house, to own good choices for subtitling typefaces. I would doubt it
    extends much higher in the project hierarchy than that \u2014 especially based
    on my experience with Lionsgate."
