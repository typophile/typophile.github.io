body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m fairly new to FontLab (5.0.2 on MacOS 10.4.7)
  and OpenType editing. Because I\u2019m not sure I want to use the Th ligature in
  my custom version of Adobe Garamond Pro, I tried making it a \u201Cdiscretionary\u201D
  ligature. That is, I cut the substitution lookup for T_h  from the liga feature
  and then pasted it into the dlig feature. (The same for T_h.caron and T_h.commaaccent.)\r\n\r\nThe
  features then worked the way I wanted in FontLab\u2019s own Preview/OpenType panel
  \u2013 and also, when I had generated and installed the font, in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nBut
  in InDesign 2.0.2 \u2013 I know, very old! \u2013 the Th ligature still shows up
  when only the \u201Cstandard\u201D ligatures are on (Basic Character Formats/Ligatures).\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have a clue why this is happening? Is it a bug in this old version of ID? (I\u2019m
  gonna have to update the program pretty soon anyway.)\r\n"

  body: Could it be so easy that a "old" copy of the font is still in the InDesign
    folder "Fonts", while you have the "new" font opened in suitcase or int the system
    library fonts folder? Just a quick idea.

  body: "Thanks, G\xF6ran, but I haven't used the ID fonts folder. It currently has
    only one font in it, KozMinStd-Regular.otf. And I have no font managers. I have
    just installed the fonts by double-clicking them and then using FontBook (also
    to deactivate older versions \u2013 but it doesn't help if I completely remove
    these). All other edits that I have made to the font so far have worked in ID."

  body: "Problem solved. Actually, there was no problem \u2013 except that I am an
    idiot. I had changed the font back to the standard version of Garamond Pro when
    fiddling with paragraph styles.\r\n\r\nThe edited font works just as it was supposed
    to."
