body: "I've roughed out the following logo prototype for a sommelier by the\r\nname
  of Maxim who's decided to call his venture \"Maximus Vinum\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MV.gif]\r\n\r\n(FYI,
  I'll probably have a non-floriated, or perhaps\r\n a more coarsely floriated, version
  for small sizes).\r\n\r\nNow I'm looking for a texty (some paragraphs of text, but
  not\r\ntoo much) font to use. Something that matches the spirit of the\r\nlogo (which
  I assume/hope is discernible in the first place) but is\r\nnot too mannered. For
  example Hollandse Mediaeval* is probably\r\na bit too much, although its somewhat
  anachronistic yet classy\r\nfeel is close to what I think I want. The ideal candidate
  would\r\nwork as a heading font as well.\r\n\r\n* Referred to in this thread: http://typophile.com/node/19096\r\n\r\nSpecific
  suggestions (or wanton brain dumps) highly welcome.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    as rough, but even a bit more archaic, or\r\nmaybe a bit mannered like an old

  body: Erasmus? Schiller Antiqua RR? I think there needs to be a de Roos-style type
    that isn't horrible, I just don't know whether there is one. Maybe one of Goudy's
    more obscure text types.

  body: "By George :-) I think Erasmus is it! It's both more\r\ntame and more elegant
    than Hollandse Mediaeval.\r\nBut I'll wait for more suggestions. And -predictably-\r\nI've
    started to also consider an old friend: Octavian.\r\n\r\nBTW, De Roos had a really
    superb (especially in\r\nthe Italic) eponymous design, but I think it has\r\nyet
    to be digitized.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For full resonance, you would have to use a version of Jenson that had the
    \"extra\" serifs on the M -- Adobe snipped them off in the default version of
    Adobe Jenson, but the proper version is in the alt characters.\r\n\r\nMy Jenson,
    Goodchild, has the full serifs.\r\n\r\nStone's Arepo has a similar quality to
    your logo, so Cycles could be good, and comes in optical scaling, handy for the
    back label on wine bottles -- I hate squinting at 6pt Snell to figure out what
    I'm supposed to be drinking the wine with.\r\n\r\nBTW, brilliant design!"

    Presse 1928-32. The book was set in a typeface called LITURGICA - a very dark
    and wide roman typeface. The Erasmus type has not a very proper g, but could work.\r\n\r\n--<a

  body: "Bingo. I was going to tell Nick \"thanks, and the idea was mine (including
    the floriation*) but this (preliminary) execution wasn't\". It's funny how things
    just fall in your lap sometimes: I had decided to try a \"V\" nestled inside an
    \"M\", and at the same time I was researching Wiegand**, then I turned that page
    in that book and thought I was dreaming! I put together the plain \"M\" with the
    floariation of the \"V\" (and had to do some distortions to the floriation), but
    I'm going to redraw it when the client pays up.\r\n\r\n* Although I wanted grapevines,
    and might\r\nstill splice in a bundle of grapes in there.\r\n\r\n** Thanks to
    your reference in another thread. I have something\r\ninteresting (relating to
    the Emerson face) to report on that btw...\r\n\r\nSo what do you think about the
    Bremer text face paired up with those initials? I like it, but it's too butch
    and too German to work here, no? He's a sommelier after all, not a beer connoisseur.
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nOK, catching up for real now...\r\n\r\nAlejandro, what about Borges?\r\n\r\nNick,
    good point about the full serifs up top.\r\nBTW, this guy doesn't <cite>produce</cite>
    wine (although he did work at a vinery in Mendoza for some months), he tells people
    what wine to have, so any small type he sets will probably be limited to legal
    disclaimers concerning drunk driving and such. :-)  Plus Cycles is wonderful,
    but maybe too clean? I'd like a font with just a little bit of grape residue at
    the bottom.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
