  font with a beautiful swash style and nice ligatures.\r\n\r\nOne such font that
  I love is \"Sauna\", especially the swash italic style \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/sauna/swash-italic/\r\n\r\nAnother
  font that I use to love is \"Livory\", with it's great shape and beautiful ligatures.
  http://www.hvdfonts.com/#76-Livory \r\nUnfortunately it has no swash style :)\r\n\r\nSo,
  what I am searching is a kind of hybrid version of  \"Sauna swash\" and \"Livory\",
  \ a font which has a nice feminine vibrancy.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDennis"

    Oneleigh Pro</a>. There is also a swash \u201Ct\u201D which will ligate with many
    other lower case characters, not just \u201Cc\u201D and \u201Cs\u201D. It\u2019s
    very good value\u2014six multi-featured OpenType fonts for $85.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    never considered it a sexualized design however, it\u2019s just an oldstyle with
    somewhat traditional swashes. I see the flourishes as an extension of contrast
    with the roman, in mixed font settings. But perhaps roman is from Mars (the default
    of course) and italic from Venus, if you want to get cute or political.\r\n\r\n"

    didn't know that it is only used in a sexual context, because my english isn't
    that good :).\r\n\r\nFF Oneleigh has nice swashes, thanks for the tip.\r\nBut
    it doesn't convince me completely ... maybe there is another suggestion? :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    swashes. Only in text size for now. '
