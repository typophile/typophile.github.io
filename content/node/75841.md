body: "I'm updating some fonts originally created in Fontographer 3.5. While creating
  the bold on some of the characters FontLab is misshaping them.\r\n\r\nThe first
  page of the attached PDF shows before, the second page after the bold effect.\r\n\r\nUsing
  the change weight in Fontographer also caused a problem unless I first used the
  \"Correct path direction,\" which fixes the problem in Fontographer. However, after
  correcting the path and regenerating the Type1 font from Fontographer so it could
  be opened in FontLab did not help the problem in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI've played with
  the various path tools in FontLab but have had no success. I'm guess there is something
  I'm missing that will fix this short of manually reshaping the character.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nKen\r\n"
