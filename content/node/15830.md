body: "In FontLab 4.5 Mac, I've manually kerned the Greek characters with one another,
  but the kerns don't show up in the finished OpenType font. What am I doing wrong?\r\nI've
  used class-based OT kerning elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI thought perhaps it was something
  to do with the way I am previewing the font in InDesign CS: grabbing text from elsewhere
  (eg Adhesiontext), pasting it, and applying a font from the menu. However, when
  I apply Warnock Pro, the kerning does work in Greek, but not for my font."

  body: "long-shot but perhaps doublemapping may be related to the problem - there
    are documented problems with cross-script kerning, and if InDesign thinks you're
    mixing Latin and Greek maybe it's stiffing you on the kerns.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: Have you applied your Greek kerning only to the Greek script tag in the OT
    <kern> feature, or also included it under the Latin script tag and dflt language
    system? I recommend including all kerning under every script tag.

  body: "Si, I haven't, to my knowledge, done any cross-script kerning, although perhaps
    some non-alphetic characters have been kerned with both languages.\r\n\r\nThat
    sounds promising John, but I don't know how to apply kerning to a language script
    tag. I don't even know what a script tag is."

  body: "I've figured out how to get manual kerning into the OpenType kern feature:
    just push the \"Apply and Save\" button in Kerning Assistance.\r\n\r\nBut I have
    another problem -- I'm getting bogus kern values I haven't made showing up in
    the kerning feature, such as between Greek and Roman characters. What's causing
    that?"
