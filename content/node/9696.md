body: I would like to convert some Mac fonts I have to PC.   <BR> <BR>Two pieces of
  &#40;PC&#41; software I&#39;ve found are Crossfont and Transtype, neither of which
  seem cheap for the simple task they perform.  <BR> <BR>Any experiences with this?  Any
  other suggestions for software?  Preferences? <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: The one that comes to mind is available at FontLab, but it seems their site
    is currently down.

  body: The FontLab one is TransType &#40;and TransType Pro, which can convert to/from
    Opentype&#41;. I used Crossfont for about 5 years in my workflow and it&#39;s
    good &#40;and at $45 I can&#39;t see why anyone would think it was overpriced&#41;,
    although I&#39;ve just changed over to TransType Pro &#40;for the Opentype features&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s never a simple, foolproof matter whichever one you use. I still
    wouldn&#39;t let anything go to print without checking it on my Mac laptop &#40;my
    main machine is a PC&#41;. You can get fonts not appearing because of cross-platform
    naming issues, glyphs substituted because of encoding problems, etc. etc. <BR>
