  body: "The font is ITC Grouch, condensed a bit with a customized k. Grouch and the
    recently ID'd Grizzly are among the ITC fonts which were available at one time
    only from Bitstream, but no more. Somebody should give ITC a good talking to.
    If they're going to go around revoking distribution rights, at least they should
    offer it themselves.\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually the k is an alternate that was part
    of the original design. It included a few other alternate characters (which were
    not included in the Bitstream version)."

      has been resigned to history. It's very sad because I have the perfect use for
      it and looking at it on MyFonts its tantalisingly close.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    coated acetate sheet used on a mechanical or on artwork as  marking material to
    position halftones, ares of color, and tints. The coating is 'stippable'; that
    is, it can be selectively cut and peeled away to create outlines and silhouettes\"\r\n\r\n\"Photostat:
    Trade name for a photoprint, more commonly rreferred to as a stat. Stats are most
    commonly used in mechanicals to indicate size, cropping, and position of continuous
    tone copy. the original copy is photographed by a special cam,era and produces
    a paper negative. From this a positive stat is made\r\n\r\n"

    if it is something short. Not impossible, but a quest for sure.

    They still sell a product like that, but without any ITC faces. \r\n\r\nOther
    \"lost\" ITC fonts from that era (many never digitized at all) include Aki Lines,
    Bernase Roman, LSC Book (3 weights + italics), Caslon 223 (not to be confused
    with Caslon 224), Caslon Headline, LSC Condensed, Didi, Firenze, Milano (neither
    of the two by that name on ITC's site are ITC Milano), Neon, Tom's Roman, Grizzly,
    and Uptight Neon."

    purchased the Bitstream Typeshop CD-ROM when starting out and upgraded it to the
    TypeHigh CD-ROM when they still had loads of yummy ITC faces on it. Never regretted
    it -- terrific value for money, better digitisations than most of the \"official\"
    Linotype and Adobe versions, and it allowed me to license loads of typefaces I
    was very reluctant to spend any money on but had to own licenses for due to the
    reality of the marketplace."

  body: I have both via the CorelDraw 8 CD bundle, although they are named Grizzly
    BT and Grouch BT - no ITC in the name or copyright. Perhaps thay make an appearance
    with other CorelDraw versions.
