  It looks like due to tech restrictions I must use a fixed width font for a project
  that, preferably, is commonly used by Microsoft Word (for the ease of our illustrious
  customers, doncha know). I can't seem to find a list of fixed width fonts that are
  found by default in Word. Could someone at least point me to a place where I could
  find such info? Googling and searching Microsoft's site didn't seem to help.\r\n\r\n"

    even MS's own typo site at\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/default.aspx\r\nto
    get lists of standard fonts installed with specific applications.\r\nI guess you
    will be able to figure out which of these are fixed width\r\nones?\r\n\r\nIf you
    are looking for a good fixed width / programming font, just\r\ncheck www.lowing.org/fonts
    or keithdevens.com/wiki/ProgrammerFonts\r\n\r\nJean"
