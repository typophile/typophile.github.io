  looking for a list of font families with at least a few serif and sans cuts - the
  more, the better.\r\n\r\ndo you know of such a list already existing, and if not,
  why not start it here..\r\n\r\ni know a few (fago, meta, stone, thesis, etc..) but
  i think there are more out there.\r\n\r\nthank you!"

    of large font families, because for bigger clients, it is very handy (and probably
    easier to convince the client to buy it) if you have one family that includes
    sans and serif ."

  body: "<em>...why?</em>\r\n\r\nConvenience.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is only part of
    the reason that sans + serif families exist, and not the main reason.\r\n\r\nThey
    exist for the expediency of the type designer/foundry, not because having a sans
    + serif family is necessarily a good idea for the end user.\r\n\r\nI extended
    the Fontesque family to include sans, not because I envisioned typographers mixing
    the two in layouts, but because the original serif face had proven to be a popular
    type design, and brand, so a product extension seemed like a good bet.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    once the type designer has one version of the face, it's a big time saver to use
    its outlines and metrics to construct the other.\r\n\r\nOf course, typographers
    can use a mega-family sans + serif in the same layouts to good effect, but speaking
    from under my art director hat, I think it's much more interesting to see someone
    artfully match a pair of typefaces that no-one else has previously teamed up.\r\n\r\nUsing
    sans + serif from the same mega-family is in danger of being rather obvious, and
    may even be just plain lazy.\r\n\r\nJames Montalbano, among others, has a better
    idea -- matched typefaces (Alfon and Giacomo) designed to work together, but with
    sufficient stylistic contrast to be <em>piquant. </em>\r\n\r\nThe main thing is
    to give them the same vertical metrics, and similar horizontal proportions."
