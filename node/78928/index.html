  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In Fournier&rsquo;s <em>Manuel</em> (1764), as translated by Carter and reprinted in Smeijers&rsquo;s <em>Counterpunch</em> pp. 99-100, we find:</p>
<blockquote>It is a safe rule that [the punchcutter] should do nothing without a correct understanding of the design of the letters, or having good models before him to allow him to catch the fashion of them, and to make such alterations as he thinks necessary. For example, such an alteration has lately been made in the case of capital letters, whose angles have been squared to give an effect of lightness, whereas they were formerly somewhat concave, which gave the letters a heavier appearance. The same thing has been done to all the angles of the lowercase letters.</blockquote>
Can anyone help me understand just what "angles" have gone from "concave" to "square"? I have a hard time following the referents in this verbal description.</div>

<p>The Didot typeface wasn&rsquo;t started until 1784. And even Baskerville was only designed in 1757 - but it did not have the unbracketed serifs characteristic of modern faces, even if it had other characteristics of theirs in incipient form.</p>
<p>However, the Romain du Roi dates from 1693. Whew!</p>

<p>I think Bill is right – I’ve never understood it well myself, but now it seems to me a key passage. Fournier did this ‘removal of bracketing’ with his own capitals, especially the larger sizes that were used for drop initials or titling. It is not so noticeable in the text sizes of the <em>romain du roi</em> (for which the engraved ‘drawings’ all show bracketing), but here is an initial for casting on a body of 96 Didot points, from the specimen of the Imprimerie royale printed in 1760.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/1 A - triple gros canon - Imp roy 1760 - 500_6432.jpg)</p>
<p>One also needs to reckon with the influence of the clean, sharp effect of big letters engraved as outlines on copper and then filled in, even if they then get bracketing added, as in this example from Diderot’s <em>Encyclopédie.</em></p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/2 Gravure - Encycl - 1 b copy bw - det - 500_3728.jpg)</p>
<p>That engraved line helps to shape the serif that eventually gets into both the capital and small letters of the new types. It is there in Fleischmann in the 1730s and the Didot types in the 1780s.</p>
<p>A note on dates. None of the punches of the <em>romain du roi</em> was cut before 1696, and the process of making it went on for decades. That big A was made by Grandjean’s successor Alexandre in 1730.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Given that reading, it&rsquo;s a bit curious that Smeijers does not return to that statement when, later in <em>Counterpunch</em> (pp143-5), he talks about the punchcutter&rsquo;s preference for avoiding sharp corners and straight lines.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I thought it might be worth putting this image up here, more as a contribution to this discussion than because I have certain answers to some of the questions it raises. It is one of some remaining punches that are believed to survive from the type that eventually became known as 60-point Caslon Old Face, one of the big sizes on which Matthew Carter’s ‘Big Caslon’ is based (another was the 72-point). As can be seen, the face is badly corroded. Both big sizes were recut in the later 19th century, apparently to make a smoother design and to strike matrices that would fit type-casting machines. (I told the story at some length in my <em>Typefoundry</em> blog <a href="http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2009/01/recasting-caslon-old-face.html">http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2009/01/recasting-caslon-old-face.html</a>.) We do not know exactly when these two large sizes of Caslon were made. Their first known appearance in a type specimen appears to be in 1764, and neither showing includes letter ‘m’. Maybe some earlier examples can be found in contemporary printing. But if this is an original Caslon punch, then as can be seen, it has unbracketed, or almost unbracketed, serifs with rather odd reverse angles at their ends. Judging from specimens other recut lower-case characters seem to have similar serifs, though not the capitals.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/Caslon 4P m punch 8 aa bw b sh - 450_5083.jpg)</p>
<p>Maybe I should add as a footnote that if these big sizes were known in early specimens as Four- and Five-line Pica (as they were), and Pica was about 12 points, it might be asked how they came to be known as 60 and 72 point. The answer seems to be that big sizes like this were originally cast with kerned descenders, rather like some later wood types, so that their capitals were in effect ‘titling’ letters, occupying most of the body, which was indeed equivalent to four or five lines of Pica. Presumably one put a support of some kind under the kerned descenders of the lower-case g, j, p, q and y, and capital Q too, to stop them bending or breaking. Later, at the beginning of the 20th century, they were cast on the larger bodies of 60 and 72 points.</p>
