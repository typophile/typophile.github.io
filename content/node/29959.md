  design and move it beyond just sketches and vector illustrations. \r\n\r\nIve purchased
  Fontlab Studio and am begining to learn the workings of the program. The advice
  I seek is an approach to designing whole alphabets . . . tips on consistency tips
  on everything. This may be a topic elsewhere, if so I will hopefully find it. Again
  any first timer tricks or tips would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    your first try, but the more you play around with your tools (not just computer
    tools, but pencil, paper, etc. too) the more you will learn how they work. Since
    you say you're in last year, you've probably done this a lot.\r\n\r\nYou should
    check out the [[how-to]] wiki.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    there in a second. Any other suggestions for classes that are centered specifically
    around type design. . . assuming or requiring the student or enrollee to have
    a solid typographic understanding? Im finishing my degree in the next year or
    so at the Academy of Art in Sf. . . the remainder online thus leaving me some
    room to work. \r\n\r\nCheers"
