  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, here follows my first modest attempt at creating a face, and my first post here as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This first part of rambling concerns the &quot;display&quot; version: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I initially had in mind was indeed a very dark 'grotesk' (yes I'm danish which is quite close to germany). And it was supposed to have been a display face including only capitals. As I progressed I felt it perhaps could be more and started working on lowercase as well. It is not to be seen as complete, rather very much in progress.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lowercase alphabet caused me a lot of troubble, and right now I can't seem to get on with it, so please critique would be nice.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now the &quot;text&quot; version: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I was doing the lowercase, I decided to progress it into a more human sans, and see wether that was possible. The result you see here is very much not finished, but indeed this is the face which I am in most need of critique and pointers. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope you'll help out, -Thomas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(By the way, the reason the lowercase 'g' is red, is that I am not quite sure wheter to do a single story or this..) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Thomas, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are some thoughts for you to consider: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) The text version is better all the way around. I'd pursue that one. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) This is condensed, but some glyphs are wide. Either narrow them up, or widen up the others. If you do intend this for text, i'd suggest widening the others. The wide letters are: c, g, s. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Again if this is in fact for text, you will probably want to decrease the x-height. That is, unless it is intended as a small-size, space saving type. In that case, you would need to refine the letterforms for performance at that size. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) If you're going to put the caps with the text version, you may want to make the cap letterforms more open. (Compare upper and lower case Ss - caps vs text) Same goes for the numerals. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) Individual letters (text): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e: Has a slight overbite :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->g: Tight in the waist. Drop the bottom down to rest on (or slightly above) the baseline. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i: Should it hook like the l? Just a thought. Or maybe it is a square serif to the right on both? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m,n: Is the m just two n's? if so you'll need to widen the n. If you choose to widen all the letters mentioned above, keep the m at it's current width. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->r: Too narrow. Looks like a chopped n. You'll need to lower the join between the branch and stem + widen the branch adding a touch more heft at the end. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s: Looks flipped. But I bet if you rotate it 180 it will still look flipped. Try shortening the top arm. Lengthening the bottom arm, and raising the spine up to where it *looks* in the middle. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->t: A bit wider on the right. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->u: Looks like the n rotated 180. This make it look wider by comparison. They should *look* the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->v,w: Several issues here. First, the bottoms are too flat. Look at Helvetica bold condesed for tricks to narrow up the base but keep the crotch deep (btw, this is a tough problem</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, I saw my name mentioned in there :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oday ouyay eakspay Nicolaj igpay atinlay? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(He he. Couldn't help myself!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what will it be, my advice to go with the *text* version, or Nicolai's advice to go with the *display* version. We are a confused group aren't we? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since this is your first font I wouldn't worry about trying to make it too unique. Get the basics first. If it's too crazy, you can avoid wrestling with issues type designers have worked on since they put down the pen and picked up the press. My suggestion might be to make a thoroughly mundane type. Looking a lots of sources to guide your decisions. You will learn quickly in this fashion.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello all, and thank you very much indeed for all the kind and constructive words! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Og ikke mindst, til danskerne <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmmm&hellip; what to choose, the text or display version? -Well indeed I am quite sure the text version would be most interesting in all aspects, as it would undoubtfully be the best 'learning experience' to throw myself into the troubbles of making it well balanced and (hopefully) legible as well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the possibility of adding more personality and a little more quirkyness to the face intrigues me equally. Also it would allow me to work on the capitals as well, as they would then need to be more in line with the lowercase.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, enough rambling, I think I'll leave the 'display' as it is, and focus on the 'text' version. I will continually be uploading work-progress in this thread (hopefully you might want to give me some pointers along the way..). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, thanks for the help -this sort of thing (forums that is..) might indeed be what makes the internet great! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Thomas</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dan. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fact that the circles connect to the letters, is not per se the norm. But if you look into danish typography history (mostly based on a handful of architects and their work), you will find this detail in many early danish faces. I suspect the original idea of this was to 'save space' in order to have lesser leading. As most of the pioneers of danish type history were architects they were indeed more practical oriented rather than focused on typography history as such. Anyway, I included this feature in the face to keep some 'nationality' in it. I would gladly post some more about dansih type history if people are interested, as the subject is something I take great interest in myself ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Thomas</div>
