body: "I always know I can count on you guys to recommend great font parings. The
  Display font I'll be using will be Fling from Letraset-Fontek and I'll need a nice
  serif to use for body text, etc. I'm looking for something in either a regular or
  light weight that will help evoke a stylish, trendy, youthful feeling. I've attached
  the text it will be used with\u2026 thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Gut reaction is a modern, like Didot or Filosofia.\r\nSecond reaction, if
    they will be used at contrasted sizes, is something like Dederon.\r\n\r\nThe apostrophe
    in Fling is unfortunate. You might want to give it nip and tuck."

    thanks for pointing out the apostrophe. I may roll my own and create more of a
    swirl."
