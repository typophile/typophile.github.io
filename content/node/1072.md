    <BR> <BR>Granted, the lc has a &#42;certain&#42; Zapf International air about
    it, but otherwise it&#39;s very different. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    I&#39;ve always liked Schneidler -- almost as much as Jenson. <BR> <BR>Still no
    new leads on the roman, though. It also reminds me somewhat of Pressig, In it&#39;s
    choppiness&#41; but that&#39;s not it either.... your sample isn&#39;t as choppy
