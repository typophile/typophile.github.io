    target audience or kept that same multi-level approach.

  body: That was a good shot at humor, Chris. More fun than a barrel of monkeys. Oh,
    dear, I seem to be trigger happy with my stock of gun puns. I thought I'd better
    fire them off before the other Chris gets here, or else he'd recoil in horror
    at the missed opportunity.

    for that! I guess this'll just provide you with more ammo.
