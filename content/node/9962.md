  body: Except for the spurs on the Gs, Helvetica Neue Black Extended is a dead ringer.
    I don&#39;t have a copy of the older, pre-Neue version of Helvetica -- perhaps
    the extended black weight in that version is a better match. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68165.jpg"
