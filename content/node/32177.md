  to be extremely accepting and approved this version after the first round. My question
  is : what do you like (or not ) and which version you prefer.\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much."

  body: "In my opinion the top version gives me the impression of children's schoolbook
    material. I could see this on Scholastics mailers and the such. I'm not sure what
    Whitfield publishes mostly. \r\n\r\nThe second has a more modern feel, but only
    slightly. I'd reduce the size of PUBLICATIONS slightly to have a reverse pyramid
    feel and should give better balance to the twin books. The spacing is fine. The
    books don't look centered (visually you might have to move them to the right more.)
    Is that Bliss Pro? What's the serif? "

    weak sides of my works. All your suggestions are great and I will surely follow
    them. Thank you.\r\n\r\nYes, that's Bliss. The serif is <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/hercules/\">StormType
    Hercules</a></strong>"

    and a fresh pair of eyes usually helps."

  body: "Whitfield is not centered, if i take the books-icon as an orientation.\r\nSecond,
    can you show an example without the fi-ligature.\r\nAnd you need a different logo
    for small sizes.\r\n\r\nFirst i thought, why two books and not one or three of
    them. After some passing time, i'm quite ok with the two \u2013 hehe :)"

  body: "The two books make the \"W\" with the covers... right?  And the pages make
    a field of grasses-like looking icon?  (Or at least, that's what I see) I like
    it.\r\n\r\n\"Publications\" is a heck of a long word, and looks good smaller &
    tucked like in your third post.   Concur with Asvetic!"

  body: "Yes, the two books covers should resemble the \"W\"? As for the \"Field of
    grasses-like looking icon\" - do you think that book covers are enough as a metaphor
    for a book? I tried that, but it wasn't convincing, at least to me. As for the
    ligature - I actually never had the chance to do a lettering logo with ligatures
    and I have been tempted by this one. Maybe I should also try a non-ligature version,
    although I doubt that the client will notice the difference.\r\n\r\nSheesh, it's
    already 01:00 AM in here...more to come in the morning."

  body: "Maybe a version where the \"pages\" are implied, the \"W\" of the 2 books
    is lost a little with the overactive look of the \"pages\". Maybe show a few pages,
    or maybe just 2 lines best described as the \"bird on the horizon\" like in this
    illustration:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ist2_548832_tropical_sunset_4974.jpg]"
