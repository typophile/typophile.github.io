  body: "I've done pro-bono work for a non-profit association/organization I'm a member
    of. Contributing in \"my way\", and thereby hopefully enhancing the perceived
    value of their publications/materials, does feel like a good thing to do; and
    I also really enjoy working with them. But I'm an up-starting self-employed designer,
    and I'd be lying if I didn't say a large part of my motivation to donate my time
    and work has been to get some cool work done where I'd have more \"deciding power\"
    / artistic licence than in a usual job, and thus get some references under my
    belt (and into my portfolio).\r\n\r\nI interned as an art director at a smallish
    ad agency a few years ago and they seemed to handle this in a similar way, FWIW:
    The few \"free\" jobs for friends or benevolent organizations were valued as occasions
    to really let loose and do some creative work without the pressures of a budget
    and most of all a nagging client. When you do pro-bono, clients just tend to be
    grateful."

  body: "Most non-profits pay for design work like everyone else - a professionally
    designed begging letter will likely generate more income than you\u2019d save
    by cajoling a grumpy designer into designing one for you for free. \r\n\r\nIs
    your research around people doing free work or specifically about people doing
    free work for non-profits?\r\n"

  body: "@sii \r\n\r\nIts specifically about people doing free work for non-profits
    & what inspires them to contribute. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nMore and more, I'm finding
    out in my research that for many, the work is largely self-motivated. This is
    not necessarily a bad thing because, as @altaira noted, many young designers rely
    upon this kind of work as a portfolio builder. However, in the project I'm proposing...
    a group of designers would collaborate on a piece of design work meaning that
    no singular person really has ownership or creative control over it. \r\n\r\nI'm
    trying to figure out if designers are willing to contribute when the personal
    gain factor is altered significantly\u2014one stands to gain a really unique and
    collaborative social experience, rather than the opportunity to have full creative
    control over a portfolio piece."

  body: I did some work for a gallery associated with the school I graduated from.
    They opened in the museum district where my wife worked. The museums had a tendency
    to hire from another school that was in the same city. I thought it might help
    graduates who wanted placement. I was/am also transitioning into more book design
    and thought it might be an opportunity. My motivations were mixed.
