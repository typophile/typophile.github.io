  Radio 4's Satuday Live programme. Obviously it's a weekly show so it won't be available
  to listen to for that long - somewhere between 6 and 8 days would be my estimate
  ;^). You can access the show from the show's homepage [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/saturdaylive/saturdaylive.shtml|here]]"

    here, and that many of you have really been having these ongoing dialogues for
    quite some time; it's more the earnestness I'm talking about.) It's kind of funny.
    I'm listening as I type this. I must admit, the article was pretty much just a
    short, little confection and so is the aftertalk (though not with as much enthusiam).
    But it made me smile, and did establish that there's a real interest out there
    in fonts for some people. \r\n\r\nStephen Tiano, Book Designer, Page Compositor

    show. Of course it\u2019s a bit weird: trying to describe some features of single
    glyphs without the audience seeing them sure is problematic and the speaker sounds
    a bit over-enthusiastic, but it\u2019s nice hearing typography discussed on a
    major BBC show anyway."
