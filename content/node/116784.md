  this font sent by a customer. It's very low resolution and small, naturally, they
  want it printed on a banner."

  body: "Perhaps you could find a reasonably close base font -- perhaps a Clarendon
    -- adjust it to conform to your image, and tack on the medial spurs. A couple
    of candidates are: Ultra Pro http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stiggy-sands/ultra-pro/
    Hint: shave off about 1/10 of the height from top and bottom, then compress the
    width and thicken the cross strokes. Cowboy Rodeo http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/
    Hint: shave off a little less, compress width , thicken the cross strokes and
    tack a serif on the top of the A.\r\nHope this is actually a font and someone
    spots it for you.\r\nDon"
