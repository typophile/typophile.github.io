  there is nothing I can do to change the main face, but I assure you, I have decorated
  the face lavishly and it doesn't look that horrible anymore.\r\n\r\nMy original
  idea was to use Goudy as a subtitle text, but my boss prefers Castellar. I believe
  the engraving reduces the amount of contrast between the main title and sub-title.
  He suggested Trajan which I may accept as we are far behind schedule to get this
  out the door but I would like your opinion. For reference here are the typefaces
  I just mentioned.\r\n\r\nhttp://planetlag.com/files/typo_goudy.png \r\nhttp://planetlag.com/files/typo_castellar.png

  of refined typographical knowledge. I'm new and my typography instructor back in
  school was rubbish."

  body: "Hi Vince, It's quite difficult to make a suggestion because I don't know
    the context you're using the typeface in - are you typesetting a book, magazine
    or what exactly?... my gut reaction would be to avoid pairing it with the serifs
    you mentioned, especially Castellar with it's 'engraved' appearance - because
    it looks visually very similar and would fight with your blackletter. I'd be tempted
    to look at pairing it with a sans-serif such as Akzidenz Grotesk, because of the
    immediate visual difference between the two.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea not
    to overthink this and just see what works on paper - print out different sample
    pages so you can compare them - pinned up next to each other on the wall, table
    or whatever. Try a sans like I suggested. Try various serifs - I think when you
    see everything together on paper, you'll be able to see at a glance what works
    and what doesn't - and so will your boss.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I've never used blackletter
    faces on any of my own projects, so I can't recommend a pairing straight off,
    I'm afraid; I don't actually mind the blackletter typeface, I've had my opinion
    changed many times when I've seen a typeface that I personally didn't like used
    really well!\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "So do I.\r\nTo combine the \"Gothic\" font with Trajan would kill the \"Gothic\",
    'cause the Trajan is too strong. I'ld use a Grotesk like Akzidenz-Grotesk or Helvetica.
    Its neutral and it lets the \"Gothic\" do its job.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
