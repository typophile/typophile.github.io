  for my cousin's company.  I want to do some edits to the logo, but I can't seem
  to be able to ID the font and I have no further info on where to find it. \r\nIn
  spite of my recommendation, my cousin used the font at some point in time, to product
  body text in a brochure. It looks awful, but it might just be my life line, since
  I can provide you with sample text to cover almost the entire alphabet . \r\nI am
  attaching it hereby, with thanks in advance for helping me out. \r\n\r\nBest regards,
  \r\nVictor \r\n\r\n"
