    Neue</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/helvetica_std_rounded_bold_condensed/">Helvetica
    Rounded Condensed</a> but it is neither. It's also possible that this is a modified

  body: "I thought [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/|Block
    Gothic Condensed]] was the closest I could find. The Condensed bold weight might
    have been squeezed, or the Extra Condensed width might have been widened. \r\n\r\n-
