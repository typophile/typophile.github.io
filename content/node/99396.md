  related to \"outline\" ends up pointing me towards tutorials and the like.\r\n\r\nI've
  noticed for some time now that outlining a typeface through convert to outlines
  in Illustrator (wordmarks, for example) results in a slightly thicker, heavier letterform.
  In most cases, it's not a big deal, but I'm finding that my current project is actually
  having difficulty, as the gain is almost a full weight heavier.\r\n\r\nThrough many
  print and screen tests, it's very clear that the outlined letterforms are noticeably
  heavier than the unconverted ones. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly's causing this gain? Is
  there any way to prevent it or correct it? I've long been told that vector logos
  and icons must be outlined (which I've never questioned - it seems perfectly logical),
  so I'm not sure if there's actually any alternative.\r\n\r\n"

    different, in terms of deciding where to rasterize a dot or not (with the former
    rasterizing more dots on the edge). I suspect the only real fix is customizing
    the font, <em>and</em> this would be resolution-<em>dependent</em>...  :-/\r\n\r\nIf
    you do need such customization done there are quite a few people here who could
    do it for you, including yours truly: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: There may have been a misunderstanding. You probably need your type "converted
    to outlines" (i.e. they become shapes, not text dependent on a font), but that
    does not mean the result needs an outline stroke (which adds half the weight of
    the line). Set the outline stroke to none.

  body: "<blockquote>Through many print and screen tests, it's very clear that the
    outlined letterforms are noticeably heavier than the unconverted ones.</blockquote>\r\nDrawing
    text is <em>extremely</em> optimized, both on screen and on laserprinters. The
    optimizations may be built into the font -- exact pixel alignment for certain
    sizes, and on-screen hints for antialiasing -- or may come from the font rendering
    system (typically, your OS and printer firmware). But as soon as you convert a
    font to outlines, all these optimizations are no longer used, and you get the
    default rendering of what comes down to a set of straight and curved lines.\r\n\r\nIf
    your final output is going to be on professional, high end, high resolution hardware,
    there is quite little to worry about. At a typical resolution of 3,000 dpi or
    higher, the differences between pixel-optimized font drawing and aformentioned
    straight/curved lines is virtually undetectable. After all, all deviations are
    going to be on single pixel level (1/3000th of an inch).\r\n\r\nIf you are going
    to output on lower resolutions, well, why do you think you have to outline your
    fonts? Maybe all it needs is to review your workflow; perhaps you can deliver
    your output without converting to outlines.\r\nAnother solution could be to <em>always</em>
    outline <em>all</em> of your text. At least then there is not going to be a difference
    between different text.\r\n<blockquote>... the gain is almost a full weight heavier.</blockquote>\r\nThat
    indeed sounds as if you inadvertently applied an outline as well. But one must
    ask: at what font size and what viewing size? The difference becomes progressively
    larger with small font sizes (or at lesser zoom levels).\r\n"

      There's no outline stroke set, it's simply type converted to paths. Like you
      said, it's much more obvious at smaller sizes - at an 8pt - 12pt height, for
      example. When outputted at a larger size, it's quite unnoticeable. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
      my best option would be to create size-optimized versions, where I negatively
      offset the path a small amount for smaller output."

  body: I am having the same issue. It may not be a big deal for stuff printed professionally
    because you can send the fonts to the print shop. This "thickening" appears when
    printed on my home (600dpi) laser printer (contrary to what some say) when I convert
    text to outlines. But again, it's no big deal because I don't need to convert
    text to outlines for my home printer. But, the big issue is that it happens when
    converting a file for the web (gif and png) -- even when you don't convert the
    text to outlines.

    app are you using in which this happens during conversion? What app are you viewing
    the text in, in which it seems thinner?\r\n\r\nFor most pro graphics apps such
    as Photoshop, you will see zero difference, at the same zoom level, between the
    initial representation on screen and the generated GIF or PNG graphic file. It
    will be pixel-for-pixel identical."

    body: Adobe Illustrator CS6 thickens type when I do Type > Create Outlines as
      soon as I do it. Even when keeping type as type (not converting to outlines)
      in Illustrator, saving for web as a gif or png results in a thickening in all
      4 up-to-date browsers I have. I assume it's because Illustrator converts type
      to outlines when saving for web. It's not very drastic, but it caused me to
      have to do a redesign when I had a Medium font next to a Bold font of the same
      font type. The Medium font appeared very close to being the same thickness as
      the Bold font. I had to change the Medium font to a Regular font before saving
      for web to get it to match my print version.
