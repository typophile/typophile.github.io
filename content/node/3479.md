  and vice-versa&#41;... Any ideas? <BR> <BR>Thank you one more time.

  body: I think this might be Chalet Paris, the skinniest version of  <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php"
    target="_blank"> House Industries</a>&#39; <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank"> Chalet</a> family. You&#39;ll have to mix&#39;n&#39;match  <BR>60s,
    70s and 80s variations to get all the characters right.

  body: 'Actually it looks like you only need to use the G from  <BR>the 70s version,
    both R and S are from the 60s or 80s  <BR>version &#40;identical designs&#41;.
    The other characters are  <BR>identical throughout all 3 versions. <BR> <BR>This
    font family has done the nigh impossible: reconcile  <BR>me with both the Helvetica
    <i>and</i> the ITC Avant Garde  Gothic  <BR>models, something I thought was inconceivable.

  body: '@ Yves Peters: thanks so much. :-&#41; Indeed Chalet Paris looks as it may
    be the one, the original text &#40;by the way from &#39;97&#41; actually includes
    a few other letters &#40;which unfortunately I wasn&#39;t able to include in my
    sample as I lack a scanner for making additional scans to these I have&#41; and
    they all appear to match, the &#34;G&#34;, yes, with that of Chalet Paris 1970&#39;s
    set, and the rest of the letters with those of Chalet Paris 1960&#39;s one I&#39;d
    dare to say &#40;taking a closer look at the &#34;R&#34; ;-&#41;&#41;... &#40;Only
    the &#34;J&#34; seems as having a tightened hook, but then again, perhaps it&#39;s
    just my impression...&#41; So, and again, thank you for the tip! :-&#41;'

    33 Thin Extended with the spur of the G removed.
