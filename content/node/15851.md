body: "French cosmetics house Lanc\xF4me has in my 'na\xEFve' view some very fine
  typography, amongst generally strong competition in the fashion/luxury field. Do
  you agree? Though I am but a tyro typophile (tyrophile?), I much admire the light,
  flowing handlettered type they introduced last year, but what first caught my eye
  was the main Lanc\xF4me logotype typically writ large (and backlit) in department
  stores. The overall impression is elegant, refined, balanced. Not overtly feminine,
  but certainly refined, discerning. Why? The letters are on the thin side, classically
  proportioned, firmly geometric, high contrast strokes, diminuitive serifs. But I
  am still at a loss. What separates this sophisticated style from the gamut of Roman
  inscription faces, or the modern Bodoni and its variants? Any and all comments welcome.
  I certainly can't put my finger on it myself.     \r\n\r\nI understand that the
  Lanc\xF4me letters are hand designed \u2013 not an existing digital type \u2013
  as many traditional logotypes are. Also, a while back, hrant responded to a previous
  Lanc\xF4me thread of mine with: \r\nThat style [the logotype] is called Elzevir.
  It started around the middle of the 19th century in France (as a reaction to Didone
  typography), and was taken up around the turn of the century by US foundries, where
  it was sometimes called De Vinne. There are some digital versions of the American
  stuff, but the original French stuff is harder to find. Our J P Knox has been working
  one on though:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/7596\r\n\r\nI tried to follow up the
  \u2018Elzevir\u2019 lead with Google, but with little success, as you might imagine.
  I find the net close to useless for anything a little obscure/difficult. \r\n\r\nA
  while back, somebody also commented on the forum that Desgrippes Associates digitized
  the original Lanc\xF4me face, but in the process \u201Clost\u201D the original logotype.
  Is this true? As regards other aspects of Lanc\xF4me\u2019s type \u201Csystem\u201D,
  the subtitled \u201CPARIS\u201D below the \u2018Lanc\xF4me\u2019 would appear to
  be Trade Gothic Extended, or similar, according to another comtributor. Trade Gothic
  certainly seems a good match.\r\n\r\nAlso, Christophe Badani of Typophrage in 2004
  finished work on a handwritten type for Lanc\xF4me \u2013 in two weights \u2013
  Light and Ultra Light. The Ultra Light has an Ultra Light Alternative.  \r\nhttp://www.typophage.com/fr/custom_fonts/lancome/lancome1.html\r\nhttp://www.typophage.com/fr/custom_fonts/lancome/lancome2.html\r\nThis
  face is very elegant, and manages to look hand lettered rather than a font. As you
  can see on one page, this is perhaps to the clever use of alternatives. The effect
  is quite compelling, in any case.  \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nDavid Perkins \r\n"

    Gothic</a> (SC; there is no lc for this face anyway).
