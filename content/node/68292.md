    noticed by this thread languishing.\r\n\r\nI like to use www.w3schools.com for
    info on HTML, CSS and the like."

  body: I agree with Don McCahill, but I do know HTML. Just learn the basic tags,
    a bit of CSS, get some JQuery, and a few fonts. Fonts are a BIG matter, if you're
    going to do design. Yeah, just go to http://www.w3schools.com.
