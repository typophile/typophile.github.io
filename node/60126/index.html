I'm designing a CD cover for a friend, and after I sent him a sample, he immediately sent it out to everyone on his mailing list to ask for feedback. Then he tells me that "a lot of people" think the font should be bigger and the text should be moved down.

The font is exactly the right size. I didn't randomly select a type size. I know what I'm doing.

As far as its positioning on the cover, I guess that's a judgment call, but why would you ask a bunch of strangers where they think something on your CD should be placed???? He certainly wouldn't ask these people if they thought the guitars had an appropriate amount of distortion, or if the background vocals were loud enough.

So how do you politely tell a client like that that "a lot of people" don't know what they're talking about, and that there's a reason that designers are hired to design things? </div>

Friends can be difficult clients, because friendship blurs the lines of professional conduct. Are you doing this work at a reduced fee (or no fee at all) because he's your friend? Some clients don't ascribe much value to work that they got free or cheap. 

If this were just some jerk who found you on Craigslist, you could tell him, <em>If all these folks on your mailing list know so much about design, get one of them to design your freakin' CD!</em> But he's not some jerk, he's your friend, so maybe you'll say to him, <em>You know, I appreciate the feedback, but I had good practical reasons for making the choices I did. Let's go grab a couple of beers and I'll tell you what I mean.</em>

Or maybe you'll let him change your design anyway, because in the long run you care more about his friendship than you do about this CD cover. It's the kind of choice you have to make sometimes when you do business with friends. </div>

It's nice to know that he took the focus group seriously enough to print out all those high res color proofs, fold and trim them, slip them into jewel cases, and mail out.

I'm guessing he didn't do that.
So perhaps your mistake was to send him a digital proof?

So make the type a quarter point larger and drop it a smidgeon, then get together with your buddy for a brew and a smoke to present the hard copy.</div>

If he's your friend, be honest with him. That's the upside to friends as clients. If you have a reason for it, tell him the reason. If these people are as wrong as you say they are, then you should be able to convince him, or at least present him with a cogent reason why you disagree. Ask him why they want it bigger. Is it because it actually looks better to them or because they think it was hard to read? And how did he present it to them? A tiny screen image or a full-size printout? Also, what did he ask them? If he asked them "what do you think?" he'll get a different response than if he asks "would you buy this?" 

Use this as a chance to draw him into the process and help him understand why you're good at what you do and why your decisions make sense. If you treat this as the first shot in an argument, it will be exactly that.

I believe you can tell a client that you disagree and want to discuss it further. It doesn't mean you won't do it if they insist. But they are paying you/ trusting you to use your judgement as a skilled professional. Pushing back is part of that process.</div>

i'm not sure exactly what you mean by the right size, but if, like a lot of designs, that is determined by the horizontal space on the paper, between two rules that you have created as part of a layout, perhaps finding a font with a larger x-height will satisfy you and the client's concerns simultaneously. </div>

I listen to the client. They are responsible for paying for printing, getting albums distributed, blah blah blah, and the huge loss if these people don't buy them. It would be to their benefit to look good. They just did a small demographic study. People pay for that information. You should buy him a beer. He made your job easier. Now, if things don't work the friend has only himself to blame for running a poor demographic study. 

If your design idea is better show them the design they asked for and then a design that you think is good they will see that your solution is best. I would provide 4 more solutions at least. I am assuming you are getting paid here or that you care enough about the client to satisfy them. Then, have him do the same demographic study. You need a contract that stipulates you have the rights to all work until payment is made otherwise they just got 5 new covers. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the input, everyone. There was some valuable stuff here, not just for this specific situation, but others, as well.

I would disagree that focus groups or demographic studies are useful for a project like this (see my Henry Ford quote above). If it were a product that was dependent on being eye-catching, it might be useful, but (and maybe I should've stated this in the original post), this isn't a major label artist, so it's not going to be in record stores (record store? what's that?). Getting input of people whose opinions you trust is one thing, but asking random strangers and then trying to please them just leads to mediocrity. Plus, if the feedback was based more on whether the design was appropriate for the musician, rather than the trite "make it bigger," I'd take it more seriously.

Sure, there are instances where you're just paid to do a job, and it makes sense to go with the flow and collect your check. But I'm a firm believer in trusting the people you hire to do what you've hired them to do. If you don't like what they do, do it yourself, or get someone else to do it.

I love Bert's suggestion!

Anyway, back to the situation:

I took some of the advice found here, told him that the type size was not randomly selected, and that it was made that size for several reasons. I also pointed out that the response he received (i.e. "make it bigger") is what everyone always says, and that it's probably safe to assume that the response comes without taking into account other factors. Plus, if everything were as big as what everyone wanted, well, EVERYTHING would be REALLY big. He agreed, and the cover looks really nice (it's just a close-up photo of his face, with the text flush right (the CD title set in one weight of DIN and his name in a heavier weight of DIN).</div>

I don't think you can compare the entrepreneurial vision of a genius (Henry Ford) to the size of type on a CD cover. There are very, very few consumers who can articulate their unmet needs and desires, or envision new technology and its applications. Pretty much everybody can look at a CD cover and say whether they would like the font bigger or smaller. 

On a more philosophical note, if the preferences of one's whole audience differs from the designer's idea of "good" design, is the design still good?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Many good points.


"Make it Bigger" is always a tough one. It may mean, "There is a legibility issue" but it can also mean, "I need to have an opinion and all I have to go off is what I think I know about advertising."

If it's free work you are providing, my creed is you get what I think looks good. I will take your feedback into consideration but that's really where it stops. I have abandoned projects altogether that turned into too much hassle and heartbreak over terrible suggestions. 

If you are charging, then give him what he wants but explain your disapproval of the amendment. If you can intelligently justify your reasoning then he will respect your educated decisions over the uneducated criticisms of the vulgar masses. Focus groups are not a bad idea, but learning to decipher them is more important.

I always base my defense on Appropriateness. "Sure the text is small, but this is a CD not an advertisement for a Day Spa. CD artwork follows its own rules."

@begsini:
Good design is a contextually dependent wormhole of a philosophical debate. Challenging/Appropriate/Obvious/Boring. In that order. What we should seek is to blur the line between Challenging and Appropriate. Tibor Kalman was challenging, but from a marketing standpoint, a failure. United Colors was still good design though. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I empathize with anyone in this situation. I did some logos for my father's remodeling business. The one that was most appropriate to his intended wealthy audience, he didn't choose because of a number of "problems" he saw--all of which I addressed and rationalized. Then he said his wife didn't like it--ohhhh the clients wife!

I came to find out a year later from her that she never wanted to get involved, but that this particular concept was her favorite--turns out he just thought it was too feminine. (Which he never told me, but that type of criticism there's not much you can do about, so I could have moved on to other concepts MUCH earlier).</div>

I'm not talking about Bert's advice (which btw I loved), but posting the cover on a site like typophile & get 'educated' feedback. That could help you convince your friend/client better than arguing over what's more important: having a design that looks good or meeting the focus group's expectations.</div>

but he attributed it to someone else,
so he wouldn't have to take the hit
for telling you he himself didn't like it.

i suspect that the friend/client with the
c.d. cover is doing the very same thing.
he says "other people think that" the type
should be bigger, and placed differently,
because that is what _he_ wants done...

so do it for him, and make the guy happy.

		<div class="commentbody">Bear in mind too that the people he sent it too may have been casting about for something to say, to appear useful. "Make it bigger" is an easy one. It might be interesting for you to see the email he actually sent and whether his language steered the comments a certain way. As in "here's the design for my CD, do you think the type is big enough?" would get the make it bigger comment. If it was a neutral "what do you think?" then the comments might carry more weight, so to speak.

Also, your comment: "the type is the right size" is exactly the wrong approach to take with your client and will likely just piss him off. Whoever suggested following his advice and showing him the bigger type along with the original had the right idea. When I present a revised pdf, I always include the original for comparison, especially if I want them to see it's better.

Many years ago the band I was playing in recorded an album. We asked the person mixing it if we could sit in and give our advice. Against their better judgement they let us. Each person in the band wanted their instrument louder. The engineer tried to explain why this wasn't a good idea, but everyone insisted. The result was a terrible sounding mix.</div>

I remember playing a great mix super loud over incredible speakers (that's a good trick when you're playing back mixes to a band) and the drummer saying "where's the tambourine?". The tambourine was meaningless in the context of the song and not played very well at that. Everyone else loved it. Musicians can only hear themselves for some ego-based reason.

Being in a band is like being a polygamist, except you don't get the usual advantage of dominating those you are married to.
