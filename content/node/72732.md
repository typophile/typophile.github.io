  Condensed No. 20 Oblique for branding on our presence at a conference. My boss told
  me to simply take Interstate and add faux italics, making it \"close enough.\" They
  are still miles apart. <em>Gaaaaaaaaaah.</em> \r\n\r\nInterstate is great, don't
  get me wrong, but its used on all our literature. I truly do not believe that using
  a different font for a temporary logo would undermine our corporate identity. I
  believe that half-assing design by using faux-italics is more likely to undermine
  our identity.\r\n\r\nI am bothered by two things:\r\n1) Suggesting that a faux-italic
  Interstate works the same as my Trade Gothic, and\r\n2) Suggesting that I should
  adhere to #1. The fact that I am now *expected* to do this is infuriating to me
  as a designer. The most frustrating thing? I know I am right, but I don't have the
  stones to say anything about it. How can I ever be a good graphic designer if I'm
  so damn passive aggressive..."

  body: Chump down the cash and license the true italic yourself. Use it in all the
    design work up until the point you send the material to print - then sub in the
    fake italic. Keep the un-fake version for your portfolio. Find another job.

  body: I suppose the main thing bothering me is that using Interstate for the logotype
    I made, changes the look of it entirely. To suggest that substituting two entirely
    different typefaces is "close enough" (for a meticulously constructed mark) is
    ludicrous to me.

  body: "> A designer who doesn't appreciate the difference.\r\n\r\nWell, that's unfortunate,
    and if your designer boss is making lots of decisions that you don't agree with,
    then maybe it's time to look for a new job. \r\n\r\nBut if this is just an isolated
    case, and a friendly discussion can't change his mind, then I'd go along with
    what he says and perhaps prepare an alternate for your portfolio as bstrom suggested.
    \r\n\r\nThe reality of working for someone else is that you're never going to
    agree with all the decisions they make, and not all of your pieces are going to
    turn out exactly as you wished.\r\n\r\n"
