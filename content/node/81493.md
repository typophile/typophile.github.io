  body: "Riccard0,\r\nThanks for your lead. Andale Sans is indeed close, if not because
    of the letter \"W\", which does not have a lower middle. The spur of \"Q\" is
    also slightly different.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle is in fact from another Lionsgate
    movie (similar to your lead), \"The Red Violin\".\r\n\r\nAs to Trebuchet, personally
    I find it a very good choice for subtile too, but the software I am using could
    not render the italic font correctly (it becomes bolder than usual). Adjustment
    has to be made too to the spacing during rendering to produce easy-reading subtitles.
    But it has a plus point compared to most san-serif fonts, as it has a curly tail
    for lower cap \"L\". It looks nicer actually on screen.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant,\r\nI get your point. Unfortunately, DVD subtitle has many limitations
    in terms of anti-aliasing, and most fonts would appear blurry, unlike subtitling
    for other movie formats, such as DIVX or MKV. Also, the rendering software imposes
    its own limitation in terms of character spacing and outline. That is why it's
    difficult to find an ideal font, though there are tonnes of fonts available out
    there.\r\n\r\nI have heeded Mike's advice and use a font editing software to customize
    the font set I need (curly \"f\", curly \"l\", musical symbol, etc, based on Franklin
    Gothic Condensed), and I am fairly satisfied (80%...) with the outcome. My quest
    is over temporarily, until such a time I can find a better rendering software.
    Thanks for all the input. It's a pleasure to receive help from the professionals.\r\n\r\nYK"

  body: "HI Hrant,\r\nThe problem with DVD subtitles is due to its primitive format/specifications.
    They are actually rendered from bmp/tif graphics that can only support 4 colors
    at any time,  and based on very small font size (about 18~24 typically). Thus
    it is almost impossible for a \"perfect\" anti-aliasing to smooth out the edges.
    So if you observe the subtitle next time you watch a DVD movie, you may realize
    the edges of the fonts are jagged. Some professional subtitling tools can improve
    on the rendering, thus giving a better and smooth-looking subtitle, such as those
    DVDs produced by Criterion. Still, it is far from perfect.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the
    sample I attached in my original post is not \"really\" the normal DVD subtitle,
    but they are being \"burnt\" onto the movie itself (the original dialogs are in
    German for that section, thus the special treatment of the subtitles for this
    portion of the movie). Hence it appears to have a smoother edge than normal but
    looks blurry.\r\n\r\nIt is only in blu-ray that these limitations are being overcome,
    with 8-bit color depth, alpha transparency, and can work on large font size. The
    end result? the subtitles look as if they are being printed by laser. Thus they
    appear sharp and crisp.\r\n\r\nYK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that a bitmap font (as opposed to >an outline font) can address specific pixels
    and not suffer from as much blur?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe designers of these tools have
    striven to optimize the rendering engine/algorithm, so as to achieve the best
    contrast/smoothing/anti-aliasing of the font edges under the severe limitations
    of color choice and transparency depth. For example, some work based on 8-bit
    color and on bigger font first before scaling the final subtitles back to the
    desired size and to 4-color graphics (it's 4-bit actually, but only 4 colors are
    allowed at any time). In this way, the outline would be more defined. It also
    means choosing the right font becomes paramount as the output of the algorithm
    differs in quality on different types of fonts. (These tools/software typically
    cost more than 1000 Euro.)\r\n\r\nSome hobbyists even use Photoshop to render
    the subtitle individually with specially designed filter to achieve the desired
    effect. It's painstaking as typically a 2-hour movie would have 1500 subtitles.
    You may read this under http://home.comcast.net/~c.linke/dvdsub/.\r\n\r\nI believe
    a bitmap font would thus be more difficult to achieve the desired anti-aliasing
    effect as there are more \"gaps\" to fill and apparently the algorithm would be
    much more complex. But that is just my guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the \"burnt\" subtitles
    I have attached appear blurry as I believe it is caused by the blending of the
    font edges with the background shadow using proven techniques such as \"Gaussian
    Blur\" so that they appear smooth. \"Burning\" the subtitles onto the movie is
    akin to printing text using a printer, while DVD subtitling is essentially an
    overlay over the movie. Thus the latter could not come close in term of sharpness.\r\n\r\nIf
    you interested, you may read this article under http://forum.doom9.org/archive/index.php/t-116734.html,
    in which they discuss about how to render high quality subtitles. Based on their
    experience, the choice of the right font type is apparently vital.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    there is an article under http://screenfont.ca/fonts/today/interim/, which discusses
    what is the ideal font for subtitling. For font specialist like you, you will
    definitely find it insightful and interesting.\r\n\r\nYK\r\n\r\n\r\n"
